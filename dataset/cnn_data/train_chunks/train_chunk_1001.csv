"Millions of Samsung devices may be at risk of attack due to a vulnerability in the firm's Find My Mobile service. An Egyptian security researcher has discovered a way to hack into the service and remotely unlock handsets from a PC. Once a hacker has access to a device, they can also change the PIN code rendering it useless to the owner. Scroll down for video . Samsung devices are at risk of attack due to a vulnerability in its Find My Mobile service (pictured). Security experts have discovered a way to hack into the service and remotely unlock handsets from a PC. Once a hacker has access to a device, they can also change the PIN code rendering it useless to the owner . Find My Mobile is automatically enabled when a user registers for a Samsung Account. It lets users remotely lock and wipe their devices if they're lost or stolen. The 'Ring my device' sounds the default ringtone at its maximum volume for one minute, regardless of any sound or vibration settings. By sounding the ringtone, it can alert people to the lost device, increasing the chances of it being found. Its Call logs feature additionally lets users check to see a list of recent calls, and if the SIM card is changed, the owner is informed. Uses beyond this are not known, and it is unclear whether hackers will be able to exploit it further to access personal information on the device. Mohamad Baset posted a proof-of-concept video at the weekend that shows him hacking a device, unlocking it, changing the greeting message and remotely calling it. His hack is controlled using the web on a PC. There are three modes of attack seen in the video: Remote mobile device lock, remote mobile device unlock, and remote device mobile ring. The flaw has also been reported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US on its National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The security researchers have given it a high-severity rating of 7.8, with an ‘exploitability sub-score’ of 10.0. This means it is a relatively easy hack and doesn't require authentication. NIST’s vulnerability report explained: ‘The Remote Controls feature on Samsung mobile devices does not validate the source of lock-code data received over a network. '[This] makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service - screen locking with an arbitrary code - by triggering unexpected Find My Mobile network traffic.’ Egyptian researcher Mohamad Baset has posted a proof-of-concept video (screengrab pictured) that shows him hacking a device, unlocking it, changing the greeting message and remotely calling it. The flaw has also been reported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) The flaw affects any Samsung device with Find My Mobile enabled (Galaxy S5 pictured) Samsung told MailOnline: 'The reported issue occurred in web user interface, and it was fixed through a patch update on 13 October.' But Mr Baset's proof-of-concept was posted on 27 October, after this patch date. MailOnline has contacted Mr Baset to discover when the video was filmed, and if the flaw is still being exploited.

"The father of Madeleine McCann said last night that social media was ‘powerful’ and should be used to ‘improve the world’ as he supported a national alert system to help find missing children. Gerry and Kate McCann, whose daughter disappeared in 2007, joined the parents of murdered schoolgirl April Jones to raise funds for the Child Rescue Alert with the charity Missing People. It comes after an inquest was opened into the death of Brenda Leyland, whose body was found in a hotel room two days after she featured in a TV report exposing internet ‘trolling’ of the McCanns. 'Powerful' social media: Kate and Gerry McCann, parents of missing girl Madeleine McCann arrive at the Mondrian London Hotel last night to attend a function in aid of promoting Child Rescue Alert . 'Still struggling': Coral and Paul Jones, parents of murdered schoolgirl April Jones, arrive for the event . Mr McCann said social media was an important tool for the Child Rescue Alert, a UK-wide system which uses email, text messages and websites to try to secure the safe return of missing children. Speaking at the London Mondrian Hotel, Mr McCann - whose three-year-old daughter disappeared during a family holiday to Portugal - said: ‘The key thing about social media is it's powerful. ‘This is a way of using it to do good. That's what we should be using these powerful technologies for - to try and improve the world.’ Asked whether they felt it was right for the media to identify internet trolls, 46-year-old Mr McCann replied: ‘I don't really want to talk about trolls, we're here very much to talk about child rescue.’ Coral and Paul Jones called on Twitter and Facebook to do more to tackle internet trolls after they received ‘horrible’ abuse online following the death of their daughter. Attendance: Actor Hugh Grant (left) and former newsreader Sir Trevor McDonald (right) were among the guests . Young girls: Madeleine McCann (left) disappeared aged three during a family holiday to Portugal in 2007, while April Jones (right), five, of Machynlleth, mid Wales, was kidnapped and murdered in October 2012 . Five-year-old April from Machynlleth, mid Wales, was kidnapped and murdered in October 2012. Apperance: Presenter Fiona Phillips was also at the function in aid of promoting Child Rescue Alert . Asked whether they had sympathy with Madeleine's parents who have previously voiced concerns about online abuse, Mrs Jones said: ‘We've had some ourselves and it took to going in the press and on the news to get it taken off. It is horrible, the people that do it.’ Asked whether the police could do more to tackle online trolls, she replied: ‘It's the internet people as well because the police can't do everything.’ Mr Jones said: ‘They should have their own policing force of some sort to do that, with legal ways to prosecute people.’ Actor Hugh Grant, former newsreader Sir Trevor McDonald and presenter Fiona Phillips were among the guests at a dinner organised by Missing People to raise funds for the Child Rescue Alert. Mrs Jones said she is still struggling to come to terms with her daughter's death. Mark Bridger was given a whole life sentence after he was convicted of April's abduction and murder and of perverting the course of justice by unlawfully disposing, destroying or concealing her body. April had been playing with friends close to her home on the Bryn Y Gog estate in Machynlleth, when Bridger, a former slaughterhouse worker, enticed her into his car. Her body has never been found. Following the recent two-year anniversary of her daughter's disappearance, Mrs Jones said: ‘I'm still struggling now to this day. We take each day as it comes. ‘Everybody's different in how they cope. Me, personally, I take each day as it comes. Some days are better. My husband takes it different, my kids take it different.’ Comments: Paul and Coral Jones called on Twitter and Facebook to do more to tackle internet trolls after they received ‘horrible’ abuse online following the death of their daughter in Wales two years ago . Death: An inquest has been opened into the death of Brenda Leyland (pictured), whose body was found in a hotel room two days after she featured in a TV report exposing internet 'trolling' of the McCanns . Mr Jones added: ‘I have days where I'm absolutely fine. Two or three days on the trot. Then I have down days. I need to keep busy.’ Mrs McCann said she believed the Child Rescue Alert could make ‘a huge difference’ in finding missing children. ‘You only have to look at the statistics to see how the amber alert in the USA has been successful - 685 children have been found alive and reunited with their families since it started,’ she said. ‘I believe the Child Rescue Alert system could do the same here.’ Mr McCann, 46, added: ‘I think it's an opportunity, the Child Rescue Alert, for the British public to help. In our case, there was a great outpouring of people wanting to help. ‘It only takes one person coming forward, responding to that piece of media, that could save a child's life and nothing can be more important.’","McCanns join parents of April Jones to raise funds for Child Rescue Alert .

"A cunning fox gives firefighters and locals the slip and leads them on a wild goose chase inside a building in the seaside city of Valparaiso, Chile in this video. The footage was filmed on Friday, September 26 and it lasts for just over one minute. The firefighters had been called to the building after reports of a wild fox inside the building in the Florida district of the city. '(It was) totally surprising because I have never seen a fox before,' commented a local resident about her surprise visitor. The agile animal managed to outrun and outsmart the firefighters along with local residents and volunteers who tried to catch the fox in order to return him to his natural habitat. 'We couldn't get very close as it was young,' said another local resident who had been witness to the whole event. Running wild: The wild fox is seen running free during the video which lasts for just over one minute . Plan: Firefighters move closer to the rampaging fox as they attempt to catch the wild animal . Restless: The fox looks restless and anxious as the firefighters gather around him and moments later he slips . Just before the fox managed to escape, it reportedly tried to bite a firefighter that was trying to grab the animal. Local police captain, Ingeborg Villa, blamed the firefighters' lack of planning for the animals' escape. 'The firefighters should have) adopted a procedure that corresponded (to the situation) to successfully rescue the animal (which did not happen),' he added. The fox managed to escape in the end by jumping off the building from a balcony and then ran off. Level down: After the fox falls off the railing he lands a level down and is free to start roaming again . Getaway: The wild fox looks down at the drop from the first floor of the apartment block down onto the road . Gone: The fox then jumps down from the first floor onto the roadside and he rushes off .","Firefighters had been chasing the fox in the seaside city of Valparaiso, Chile .

"Hundreds of phone booths in New York have been fitted with 'beacons' - which can locate exactly where a person is - having been given the green light by authorities. Beacons are a low-cost piece of hardware, small enough to attach to a wall, that use Bluetooth connections to send messages to a smartphone or tablet. Because beacons can tell someone's precise location, they are attractive to advertisers and have already been trialled in Major League Baseball Stadiums in the US. Hundreds of New York phone booths have been fitted with beacons that can determine a person's location (file picture) The city allowed advertising company Titan to install the Bluetooth devices in phone booths throughout the city. Nicholas Sbordone, a spokesman for New York's information agency, told BuzzFeed that Titan was allowed to install the technology without any formal approval process, as it was being used for 'maintenance purposes only'. For the technology to work, the relevant app is required on a smartphone. Then, when a person walks past a Beacon, relevant content is sent to their smartphone and data can be shared from the phone via the app. The app can then communicate with the person accordingly. The city allowed advertising giant Titan to install the Bluetooth devices without any formal approval process . One of New York’s leading privacy advocates, New York Civil Liberties Union executive director Donna Lieberman, was critical of the new technology. He said: 'To the extent that the city is involved in this, the lack of transparency [is] of even greater concern.' The beacons are manufactured and sold by Gimbal, a company based in San Diego. A Gimbal beacon requires a third-party app to trigger advertisements and those apps need 'opt-in' permission from users to collect data and send notifications. Users must also have Bluetooth enabled. Gimbal-powered apps may collect your current location, the time of day you passed the beacon, and details about your device. These apps may also, under certain circumstances, collect data about the websites you visit, the apps on your phone, and the 'frequency and duration of app usage.' Gimbal COO Kevin Hunter said through a spokesman that the company only provides clients with 'aggregated, anonymized data.' Indeed, Gimbal does not collect names, email addresses, or other personally identifiable information.","Hundreds of phone booths in New York have been fitted with 'beacons'

"It is a story worthy of the big screen - how an iconic cinema hidden in a quiet corner of Leeds defied all the odds to stay open for a century. The Hyde Park Picture House first opened its doors in November 1914 and quickly became the place to see news bulletins and morale-boosting dramas during the First World War. Now a hub for art house and independent films - the venue is as popular as ever thanks to its position in the student heartland of Leeds, West Yorkshire. Iconic: A picture of the cinema shows the interior of the venue in the 1950s - when televisions started to fill homes . Amazing landmark: The Hyde Park Picture House, on Brudenell Road, Leeds, is celebrating its centenary birthday today . The beautiful Grade II-listed Picture House is one of the oldest purpose-built cinemas in the UK - screening patriotic drama Their Only Son on its opening night on November 7 1914. Despite the outbreak of war in August that year, the Hyde Park Picture House was built and opened ready for business. Pages of the Yorkshire Evening Post were almost entirely devoted to news of the war but a small advert announced the opening of the new venue - proudly proclaiming itself to be 'The cosiest in Leeds'. Since then it has fought to live up to this title and has managed to adapt to the ever-evolving world of cinema becoming a student hot-spot. Film-making societies have their socials at the venue - Northern Film School choose it for their end of year show while Leeds College of Art also uses it to host inductions for those in their foundation year. The cinema, which still uses 35mm film, is hosting a 1914-themed event showing archive footage - including newsreels, dramas and comedies - from the period . How it lookd today: Little has changed in the exterior of the cinema - which is vastly popular with students living in Hyde Park, Leeds . Industry challenges such as the transition to sound, the competition from television, the multiplex boom and home entertainment were all overcome, although in 1989 the landmark had to be saved from closure by Leeds City Council. It is now owned by the council as part of the Leeds Grand Theatre and Opera House Ltd - an independent company dedicated to preserving and securing the future of three of Leeds's most culturally significant venues. The cinema has developed a film programme dedicated to screening independent, art-house and classic films from around the world. And now, to honour the grande dame of cinemas, a special evening of live music has been organised - courtesy of the After Hours Rauchestra swing band - alongside period screenings and newsreel showings, to transport cinema goers back 100 years.

The 'A Night at the Cinema in 1914' event forms part of the 28th Leeds International Film Festival and is one of six free screenings at the Picture House currently. Wendy Cook, Hyde Park Picture House's general manager, said: 'Getting to this point has only been made possible because of all the amazing support we've received over the years. 'So to the countless staff members and volunteers, the thousands of wonderful audience members and our many partners and friends in this fantastic city, we'd like to thank each and every one of you for helping us get this far.

A second event has been planned to celebrate the centenary on November 22, when a film commissioned by the Picture House and arts organisation Pavilion by artists Luke Fowler and Mark Fell is screened. Councillor Lucinda Yeadon, Leeds City Council's executive member for culture and skills, added: 'Leeds has a unique history with the art form of film dating back to October of 1888 when Louis Le Prince captured the first bit of moving image footage on Leeds Bridge. 'By celebrating the centenary of the Hyde Park Picture House we are celebrating a culture of film watching and making in our city that we can all enjoy and that Leeds City Council is proud to be part of supporting.'

"Glenn Gleeson, who died at the family home in Hertfordshire in May aged 16. An inquest heard today he may have choked on his breakfast after taking morphine pills at a family party the night before . A teenage boy apparently choked to death on his Weetabix cereal the morning after he took drugs at a family party, an inquest heard today. Glenn Gleeson had taken morphine pills prescribed as medication for his mother's partner, which were left lying in the house described as 'chaotic'. The coroner heard that the 16-year-old's breathing failed as he ate his breakfast and resulted in heart failure and his death. The teenager was found by his half-brother Jamie slumped in a chair in a summerhouse at the family home in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, on the morning of May 5. Emergency services were called to the scene but were unable to revive Glen and he was declared dead of heart failure. Police officers then found alcohol, packets of morphine and traces of cannabis around the house, but only morphine was discovered in his system. At the inquest in Hatfield in Hertfordshire today, the teenager's family and friends wept as coroner Edward Thomas recorded a verdict of misadventure. He said that Glenn died 'needlessly' and warned of the dangers of leaving any types of drugs around the house. Members of Glenn's family, including his mother Tracey and her friend Paul Rawlins, Jamie's father, had been drinking at the house the night before his death. The hearing was told Glenn was the last one to bed but he had not been drinking. The following morning his half-brother Jamie went out to the summerhouse and found Glenn sat motionless in a chair with a bowl of Weetabix on his lap and some of the cereal around his mouth. Emergency services were called to the scene shortly before 11.20am while Jamie started CPR, pulling his half-brother out onto the garden grass to do so. An air ambulance was called, landing in a nearby playing field, but Glenn was declared dead by paramedics at the scene. At an inquest into his Glenn's death today, Coroner Edward Thomas recorded a verdict of misadventure . As well as alcohol, packets of morphine prescribed to Mr Rawlins were found around the house. Tests found that Glenn had 53 microgrammes of morphine per 100 millilitres in his blood. Dr Miriam Mitchison, the consultant pathologist who carried out the post mortem examination, found some food in Glenn's lungs. However, she said she could not be sure what role this played in the teenager's respiratory failure. Mr Thomas said: 'If he hadn't had the morphine he wouldn't have been sick. If he hadn't been sick it wouldn't have gone in his lungs. The combination of the two causes acute cardiac failure. 'He did something that was risky and it had an unintended consequence.' Glenn would have been unable to react to what was happening and felt no pain as he died, almost like he just 'went to sleep', the coroner said. The inquest held in Hatfield today heard that the 16-year-old may have choked to death while eating Weetabix for his breakfast . He added: 'Alcohol wasn't a problem for him but the household was all chaotic because of that and things weren't in order. 'When things are chaotic things like tablets are not kept in ordered places. You need to have those things in places you know and places where people won't say, ""I will try one of those."" 'You don't know the effect of what you're trying. This is a young lad who died needlessly.' Addressing distraught friends and the family of Glenn, Mr Thomas continued: 'You will miss him for quite some time. 'You may come to terms with his death but it will never be the same.'","Glenn Gleeson, 16, had taken morphine prescribed for his mother's partner .

"Gerard Baden-Clay has applied to be moved into a 'cushy' part of his jail . Wife killer Gerard Baden-Clay has requested to be moved from his maximum security cell and relocated into a more 'cushy' part of his Queensland jail just months into serving a life term. Baden-Clay, who was jailed  for the murder of wife Allison in June, has applied to move from his 50-bed unit cell inside Wacol's Wolston Correctional Centre, near Brisbane, to the prison's six-bed unit section. The 43-year-old old has also applied for work inside the prison workshop, part of a requirement that favours applications for an upgrade in living standards. In order for prisoners to be relocated they must prove they are trustworthy, be working or looking for work and have a good association with prison bosses, The Courier Mail reported. Gerard Baden-Clay has applied to be moved inside his Wolston prison (pictured) where he is under strict monitoring . Gerard Baden-Clay was taken down into the cells beneath the Brisbane Supreme Court after being pronounced guilty of murder and escorted to Wolston Correctional Centre . Gerard Baden-Clay joined reviled child killer and paedophile Brett Peter Cowan (pictured), who has been on deep protection inside Wolston Correctional Centre since being convicted in March of the 2003 murder of Sunshine Coast teenager, Danilel Morcombe . Gerard Baden-Clay projected an 'air of authority' while imprisoned awaiting his murder trial at Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre (pictured) in far western Brisbane . CCTV footage of Gerard Baden-Clay at a supermarket on the last day his wife was seen alive . His application for an upgrade comes just over two months after the 43-year-old was convicted at Brisbane's Supreme Court for the murder of Allison Baden-Clay. Since then he has been confined to the cells of the Wolston Correctional Centre where a prisoner's day starts at 7.30am for breakfast. Baden-Clay is walked each morning from his cell for a simple serving of toast or basic cereal. He is than provided lunch, consisting of two slices of cold meat or a vegetarian alternative with a fruit salad. Exercise follows thereafter, and headcounts of inmates are conducted routinely alongisde strict eating times. A serving of chicken, beef or fish and basic vegetables is provided for dinner about 4.10pm before inmates are locked away at 5.30pm. Among his fellow inmates is Brett Peter Cowan, who was convicted of the 2003 murder of schoolboy Daniel Morcombe on the Sunshine Coast. It was originally thought that Baden-Clay would be subjected to harsh treatment from fellow inmates but according The Courier Mail this is not the case. He also has not been invovled in any incidents. Gerard Baden-Clay (pictured with his wife, Allison) spent time in his jail cell studying law books and filling out forms and affidavits leading up to his trial for Allison's murder, all to no avail . Baden-Clay was escorted by police vehicles which accompanied his prison van on its 22km journey from the court out to Wolston prison after his July sentencing. Upon his arrival, he was led to one of three holding cells before being strip-searched and was issued green prison uniform and tracksuit, denim jeans and shorts, and a hat. Two photographs would have been taken for police records and for his  prison ID. He would have spoken with a psychologist about his mental state and had a physical check before being locked up. It took a 21 days of deliberations inside the Brisbane Supreme Court, before a jury found the 43-year-old guilty of murdering his wife Allison. He was been sentenced to 15 years in jail before he is eligible to apply parole.","Gerard Baden-Clay has applied to be relocated inside his maximum security Queensland jail .

"More than one million Wonga customers have been left confused about whether they are one of the 333,000 borrowers to have their loans written off by the controversial payday lender. The company announced it would write off £220million in debts after regulatory body, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), revealed it had loaned money to people who could not afford to repay. It means that those who have fallen more than 30 days behind with repayments and should never have been given loans will have their debt wiped entirely. Scroll down for video . Wonga customers face anxious wait to find out whether they will have their loans written off by payday lender . While around 45,000 customers who are up to 29 days in arrears will be asked to repay their debt without interest and charges and will be given an option of paying off their debt over an extended period of four months. But borrowers have been left in limbo after Wonga’s announcement last week when they were told all customers would be contacted to notify them about whether they will be included in the redress programme. The FCA told the lender, which quotes an annual interest rate of 5,853 per cent, it had to contact those affected by the end of the day yesterday. One customer told the Guardian he did not know whether he should pay an instalment of his repayment plan or risk accruing more charges if it was deemed he was not entitled to a write-off. The payday company said yesterday that it had contacted 375,000 customers by email to let them know what they needed to do next and urged them not to involve a third party with their case. In the email from Wonga to those affected it said the company ‘will automatically clear any outstanding debt you have with us’ by the end of October. Wonga's TV adverts, which feature 'pensioner puppets', have been criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority . It added: ‘We recognise that we may not have always made the right lending decisions and for this we apologise. We intend to be sure in the future that we only lend to customers who can afford to repay the loans’. Customers were also advised they ‘do not need to do anything’. Wonga is expected to contact the remainder of its one million customers to let those that have not been affected that that is the case. However regulator FCA said there is no set timeframe for this, but it is anticipated it will be done as quickly as possible. However some borrowers who say they were over the 30-day arrears period have taken to online forums after they did not hear from the payday lender. 'Vicarondo' posted on the Money Saving Expert forum: 'I never heard a thing either, 197 days in arrears and still they want £1045 off me on a £1000 loan (salary only £1200) have paid £600 back already. Really thought I would be one of the ones to be wiped.' The user explained to forum members that his financial problems began in November when they missed a couple of payments on a credit file. They added: 'By March when they lent me the £1000 I would have had lots of late payments on my credit card, next account and on my car payments.' Vicarondo later updated the thread saying they had rung Wonga and was informed they were not affected by the redress. Some Wonga customers who expected to receive an email after being over the 30-day arrears period say they have been told by the company that they were not affected by the redress . 'When I asked why she said she couldn't tell and didn't know what criteria had been used and then just read me a scripted response really,' they added. 'Wonder why they've deemed me not affected when they lend me 80 per cent of my monthly salary.' The user has since said they intend to contact the financial ombudsman about the issue. Other users said that they were expecting an email from the company, despite the fact their debt had been sold on to a third party. It comes after the Money Saving Expert reported that Wonga would be handling cases 'even if a customer's debt has been sold on to a third party or they've entered into an individual voluntary arrangement or debt management scheme.' Forum user 'Brogden' posted: 'Wonga DID sell debts on........mine sold to ARC Europe (Gothia....?) I have heard nothing - no email or anything.' But Wonga posted on its Twitter page today that the forbearance programme does not include customers whose debt was sold. Entrepreneur: Mr Damelin founded Wonga in 2007 and it quickly shot to a billion-pound business . The founder of the controversial payday lender Wonga pocketed almost £1million last year despite the firm lending to thousands of people who could not afford to pay their loans back. Errol Damelin's £970,000 package - up more than a quarter on 2012 - is understood to have included a payoff of almost £700,000 for 'loss of office'. South African Mr Damelin's pay was revealed this week in Wonga's annual accounts. Despite leaving the day-to-day running of the firm in November, as the highest-paid director Mr Damelin is understood to have received a basic package of £273,000 plus a £697,000 payoff - bringing his total pay to £970,000. By comparison, all of Wonga's other directors put together earned £252,000 last year. The company added: 'We said at time that we will continue to work with the FCA to see if additional remediation is needed.' Other customers have also pointed out that the email issued by the company yesterday had landed in their junk mail folder, which explained why some people who expected to receive correspondence had not yet heard anything. Paladindc wrote: 'BT/Yahoo spam filters put my email in there [junk mail folder]. Had to go to the email website, as my phone doesn't sync with the spam folder. Was only able to log into it this morning. Made for a long night, but all written off.' The seven-year-old firm has been criticised for making loans of up to £1,000 in just seconds – usually to people who end up taking out further loans to pay off their debts. It claimed that for each application an algorithm checked between 6,000 and 8,000 ‘data points’, which was said to be a better indication of borrowers’ ability to pay back a loan than traditional credit checks. But the FCA said that debt charities and campaigners had supplied information which confirmed claims that Wonga was not properly checking whether its customers could afford the repayments. The company has now been forced to scrap its affordability check procedure and is developing a new lending criteria, which will be examined by the regulator. Wonga said it would be accepting significantly fewer loan applications and that some existing customers would no longer be able to use the service. It has said it expects it will be ‘smaller and less profitable’ in the near term as it carries out the task of cleaning up its reputation. In June, Wonga was ordered to pay compensation of £2.6 million by the FCA after sending threatening legal letters from fake law firms to 45,000 customers. The regulator said Wonga had been guilty of ‘unfair and misleading debt collection practices’ by creating fake companies to pressure struggling customers into paying their bills. The firm, which unlike many payday lenders has its roots in the UK rather than the United States, has around one million customers and a default rate of around 7 per cent on its loans. Wonga is one of several payday lenders which recently signed up to a new real-time information sharing service, helping it to make more accurate decisions about who to lend money to. Going ahead, Wonga plans to overhaul the image it presents to the public, especially through its advertising, in a way that cuts the risk of it inadvertently attracting the very young or vulnerable. Wonga's cuddly, elderly puppets disappeared from TV screens in July, as Mr Haste said he was ‘very aware’ of criticism of its marketing campaign. The firm has no immediate plans to launch a new advertising drive. Compared: While Wonga's revenues were up by £5million in 2013, their costs increased by almost £50million . April 9: Advert banned . The Advertising Standards Authority watchdog rules a Wonga ad confused the public about its interest rates - which were a representative APR of up to 5,853 per cent. More than 30 complaints were received about the advert, which Wonga denied was misleading. June 25: Fake law firms scandal .

"Judge Peter Ross has blasted the UK Border Agency for handing out 170 bogus workers . Border chiefs have been blasted for ‘catastrophic’ failures over a £500,000 scam that allowed more than 170 bogus Pakistani workers and their relatives to illegally enter Britain. A senior judge branded it a ‘scandal’ that the discredited UK Border Agency had handed out so many work permits to a company which even its own inspector warned was a front for a massive immigration racket. The firm, Techsense UK, claimed it had lucrative IT contracts with private and public sector giants including Microsoft, BT and the NHS – even though a single phone call would have exposed this as a fraud. Bosses told officials that they needed staff from their sister firm in Islamabad, Pakistan, to work in highly-skilled £40,000-a-year jobs at their plant in Milton Keynes. But many of those who travelled to the UK on false pretences actually got jobs in fast food restaurants and stacking shelves in supermarkets. In a highly unusual move, the judge hauled a senior border official into court to explain the scandal and accused the Home Office of attempting to cover up the fiasco to ‘spare their blushes’. It is the second time in a week that the now-defunct Border Agency has been condemned by the courts over shocking failures. Last Thursday, a vicar suspected of running Britain’s biggest sham marriage racket walked free last week after his £1million trial dramatically collapsed as a result of ‘serious misconduct’ by the former Home Office agency. Two disgraced public servants, since suspended from duty, are facing criminal charges themselves after the case of Ugandan-born clergyman Reverend Nathan Ntege, 54, was thrown out of court. The latest criticism from the judiciary is a huge embarrassment for the Home Office and raises urgent questions about the state of the nation’s beleaguered immigration controls. Scroll down for video . Furious Judge Peter Ross said the agency was guilty of a ‘catastrophic failure to check the material provided’ by Techsense UK. He said: ‘It is a scandal that no one checked with the organisations that were supposedly contracting with Techsense UK. Many of them were in the public sector. It would have been so easy but everything was just taken on the nod. ‘The applications kept coming time and time again. This was a company apparently growing exponentially and no one thought: “Hang on”.’ Home Secretary Theresa May brought the under-fire Border Agency back under the Government's control . Incredibly, a Border Agency official who visited the Islamabad office placed the company on a ‘watchlist’ because he feared it was a front for an immigration racket. But staff who were responsible for overseeing permits for Techsense UK were never alerted. The judge said: ‘[The inspector] went to the Islamabad office and realised there was something seriously wrong, that this company was going to lose half its workforce to the UK and there didn’t even appear to be that number of people there go start with.’ ‘Why when the company was placed on a so-called watchlist did no one bother to tell the case workers?’ Techsense UK was set up by Pakistani nationals Rashid Ghauri, 42, and Ali Junejo, 35, both of Milton Keynes, supposedly to contract IT work for other firms, Oxford Crown Court was told. The pair submitted letters and emails to the Home Office claiming ‘partnerships’ with organisations including the NHS, Microsoft and IBM. In fact, this so-called proof was actually welcome messages they had received for signing up to services on those companies’ websites and the contracts did not exist. Despite this, the company was classified as ‘low-risk’ by the Home Office and awarded a licence to grant certificates of sponsorship – a significant step in someone being awarded a work permit. Between 2009 and 2012, the UKBA handed out 117 certificates to Techsense UK. This led to 55 three-year visas being issued to people travelling from Pakistan supposedly to work for the loss-making company. Prosecutors estimated that more than 120 family members were also granted visas to join them – making a total of at least 175 Pakistani nationals brought here illegally. UKBA officials made two visits to the company’s offices in Milton Keynes and one to the plant in Islamabad, Pakistan, but no-one verified the existence of the supposedly lucrative IT contracts. Ghauri and Junejo, the company directors, are estimated to have made at least £500,000 between them by selling the work permits for up to £4,500 each. Border chiefs have been blasted for ‘catastrophic’ failures over a £500,000 scam that allowed more than 170 bogus Pakistani workers and their relatives to illegally enter Britain . The pair may have got away with their duplicity had it not been for a separate tax investigation by HM Revenue and Customs which uncovered the scam. Judge Ross also criticised the Home Office for failing to disclose vital information to the prosecution until the last day of the trial – jeopardising the entire case. He said: ‘Whether it was to spare blushes or simply as a means of efficiency I don’t know.’ The Border Agency’s head of sponsorship unit, George Shirley, was hauled into the witness box to explain the debacle. He said the unit had ‘tightened up its checks’ on companies. Ghauri was jailed for six years for fraud and money laundering and Junejo was imprisoned for six-and-a-half years. The judge said: ‘You sought what was a wholly fraudulent application for a licence to grant sponsorship agreements, so that people who would not otherwise be entitled to enter the UK would come in to the UK and inevitably were able to stay here after. This was about making money.’ The UK Border Agency, which was axed last year after a series of scandals and replaced with UK Visas And Immigration and Immigration Enforcement. The UK Border Force was created after being hived off from the agency in 2012.","Top judge said number of bogus work permits handed out was a 'scandal'

"A letter found in a time capsule that was buried more than a century ago predicted modern flight and video communication that would allow us to see the face of who we were talking to . The note written by George A. Litchfield, the business manager of the Boston Traveler, in 1901 was dug up along with a number of other historic items in the city's Old State House last week. In it he describes his visions of the future that included adventures in flight, exploration, and communication. Prediction: The note written by George A. Litchfield, the business manager of the Boston Traveler, in 1901 was dug up in the city's Old State House last week . He said that man would be able to fly able to with leisure and without cumbersome machinery. However some of his estimations were wrong as, according to the Boston Globe, he said we would be connecting with people in 'distant worlds' by the middle of the 20th Century. Litchfield wrote: 'Before the midway of the century shall have been reached distant worlds will be communicating with us, and we shall know the mysteries of the spheres. 'We shall fly; not merely navigate the air with cumbersome machinery sustained by bags of gas, but we shall step from our houses, and at our convenience or pleasure [fly]'. He also predicted that humans would be talking via video, long before Skype and Apple's FaceTime. and guessed that steam power would decline. Historic items: A piece of wood with the hand written description: 'Wood removed from the Old Lion age of same 21 years in 1900' is displayed after it was taken from a 1901 time capsule . 'Long before it completes its cycle, steam will have given place to other motive power not yet discovered,' he added. 'We shall speak around the world. We shall see the face of him with whom we talk.' The capsule was removed last week from the head of lion statue that has long stood guard over the Old State House. The Bostonian Society, which oversees the historic building, released an inventory of the items Wednesday. The presence of a red hardcover book, with no visible title, surprised the organization because it had not been included on a list discovered by an ancestor of a man who worked on the statue, nor was it referenced in a recently-uncovered 1901 newspaper article about the time capsule.","Note was written by George A.

"Concerned about potential security risks, the U.S. government is taking a close look at last week's sale of New York's iconic Waldorf Astoria hotel to a Chinese insurance company. U.S. officials said Monday they are reviewing the purchase of the Waldorf by the Beijing-based Anbang Insurance Group, which bought the hotel from Hilton Worldwide for $1.95 billion. Terms of the sale allow Hilton to run the hotel for the next 100 years and call for 'a major renovation' that officials say has raised eyebrows in Washington, where fears of Chinese eavesdropping and cyber espionage run high. Security fears: U.S. officials said Monday they are reviewing the purchase of the Waldorf by the Beijing-based Anbang Insurance Group, which bought the hotel from Hilton Worldwide for $1.95 billion . The officials also said the sale could have implications for the government's longstanding relationship with the hotel, which serves as home to the American ambassador to the United Nations and hosts the president and hundreds of U.S. diplomats during the annual U.N. General Assembly. 'We are currently in the process of reviewing the details of the sale and the company's long-term plans for the facility,' said Kurtis Cooper, a spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. He and other officials said decisions about the future of the U.S. relationship with the Waldorf would be made based on cost, Anbang's long-term plans for the hotel, and the government's needs and security concerns. The officials said specifics of the renovation plan would be a key issue of the review. 'The State Department takes seriously the security of its personnel, their work spaces and official residences,' Cooper said. 'We are constantly evaluating our security protocols and standard operating procedures to ensure the safety and security of our information and personnel.' The department routinely warns U.S. diplomats in China about physical and electronic surveillance and tells American citizens in the country to be aware of similar risks, notably in hotels. 'Hotel rooms (including meeting rooms), offices, cars, taxis, telephones, Internet usage and fax machines may be monitored onsite or remotely, and personal possessions in hotel rooms, including computers, may be searched without your consent or knowledge,' according to the department's latest travel advice for China. 'Business travelers should be particularly mindful that trade secrets, negotiating positions and other business-sensitive information may be taken and shared with local interests.' Long-term agreement: For more than 50 years, the State Department has leased a residence for the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. on the 42nd floor of the hotel's Waldorf Towers . For more than 50 years, the State Department has leased a residence for the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. on the 42nd floor of the hotel's Waldorf Towers. And, every September, the department takes over two floors of the Waldorf to serve as headquarters for the horde of U.S. diplomats that decamp from Washington for the U.N. General Assembly. During the session, the president spends several nights at the Waldorf. U.S. law allows the department to rent the ambassador's residence for a term of 10 years or less. The current lease expires next year with an option to renew it for one or two years. It was not immediately clear if the review would affect decisions about the possible renewal of the existing lease. Ending the government's relationship with the Waldorf could be problematic and expensive, according to officials who note that numerous studies conducted during both Republican and Democratic administrations have concluded that it is cost effective and convenient. Cooper noted that the U.N. ambassador's residence must meet a long list of requirements, including appropriate housing, reception space, security, proximity to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations and the U.N. headquarters.

"Oliver Foster-Burnell has won a landmark legal battle against Lloyds Bank . Banks could face paying out billions of pounds to overdraft customers after a landmark legal battle was settled in favour of a man who was charged £750 for being just £2.67 overdrawn. Oliver Foster-Burnell from Taunton, Somerset, went a few pounds over his £500 limit with Lloyds while he was in between jobs in 2008. Within weeks, the 28-year-old received a letter saying for that every day since he had been charged £20 by the bank. The fees spiralled to £750 before Mr Foster-Burnell was able to find a way out of his financial mess. But, after settling his debts, he took his case to county court where a judge ordered the bank to pay back the fees with interest. His victory could pave the way for billions to be returned to customers in similar situations if Mr Foster-Burnell is able to convince a High Court Judge that his case could apply to others. If successful, banks could face returning as much as £30billion to 12.6million customers, according to a study by The Office of Fair Trading. Mr Foster-Burnell recalled the emotional toll of being bombarded with notices telling him he was plunging ever further into debt after losing his job as an emergency care responder. After dipping past his overdraft, he was sent a letter two weeks later telling him he'd been charged £20 a day since the transaction. 'They really didn't listen to me at all when I would call them every day to try and sort it out. 'It is unfair the banking industry is allowed to profit while people suffer financial hardship. 'It was incredibly stressful, I could just see the clock ticking and the debts adding up.' For the first two months he was charged £165 a month, and then £75 a month until the following March, when he felt forced to employ a debt management company. Scroll down for video . Due to the extortionate bills he ended up defaulting on two credit cards - one with Lloyds Bank - incurring further late payment charges of £1,400. It took two years for him to pay off his debt, and he finally felt able to start tackling the bank early last year. After facing them in court in June, he received his winning judgement last month. His victory is the first known for a customer on the fairness of bank charges since a Supreme Court hearing in 2009. He faced them in Taunton County Court in June and received his winning judgement last month - the day he arrived back from his honeymoon with new wife Rachel, 28. The 28-year-old from Taunton slipped into debt while in between jobs but was fined a total of around £750 by the bank for going over his £500 limit by just £2.67 . Mr Foster-Burnell, pictured with his wife Rachel, has decided to take his battle to the High Court so that others may be repaid . Who can claim back bank charges now? Those in 'financial hardship' can still reclaim their bank charges. You are judged to be in hardship if for example, you cannot meet your essential bills, if you suffer a drop in income or if you are living off credit and need to borrow more each month. Should Oliver be successful in the High Court, millions more could claim. How do you know what you've paid in charges? Charges usually apply when you stray over your agreed overdraft limit. There can be interest on this money and additional charges for direct debits that are declined or bounced cheques. You'll be able to find what charges you have paid from your bank statements. Online banking services can provide statements, or your bank may provide this if you ask. Where can they claim? Those claiming back bank charges must first make their claim to their bank. If unsuccessful, they have the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which is a free service that can produce a legally-binding decision compelling banks to pay the money back. How much can they claim? Banks have been able to level charges of £30 or more when account holders go into the red and, although charging structures have become less harsh since 2009, individuals can still run up charges of many hundreds of pounds. Successful claimants have a right to get this money. Deputy District Judge Richard Stockdale said his decision was based on European law which states that companies can not change your contract without an explanation. He said the bank’s terms and conditions caused a ‘significant imbalance... to the detriment’ of Mr Foster-Burnell and ordered they should pay him back and remove a default on his credit file. Following the decision, Mr Foster-Burnell has decided to take the issue to the High Court. 'I could just take the judgment from the court, but I don’t think the banks should continue doing this to other people. 'I can see the people they are doing this to most - it’s single mums, people struggling, and people who live close to the wire every month.' 'If successful it will impact 12.6 million people - quite big really considering it started with £2.67. 'The people it could apply to are anyone who the bank has charged at all, they don’t necessary have to be in financial hardship. 'My judgment was based on the fact that if you get a letter from your bank saying your terms and conditions have changed, an EU judgment, which we referred to, said they must be clear about how they have changed, and how they apply. 'My barrister is quite confident we’ll win, and he knows what he is doing.' A spokesman for Lloyds Banking Group said: 'We do not discuss individual customer cases and any decision will be specific to its facts. 'However, the legal issues relating to bank charges were dealt with comprehensively and conclusively by the judgment of the Supreme Court.' Martin Lewis, founder of the Moneysavingexpert website hailed Mr Foster-Burnell a ‘pioneer’. He said: 'It’s up to the court to decide if such a term can be unfair to all - regardless of whether they’re struggling in financial hardship. 'Potentially, we’re talking billions of pounds.' Mike Dailly, principal solicitor at the free legal resource, the Govan Law Centre, added his case may be ‘potentially dynamite’ because the argument used ‘provides a new legal route to challenging unfair charges’. Now Mr Foster-Burnell, pictured with Martin Lewis from Moneysavingexpert.co.uk (centre) and Kate Briscoe, his solicitor, is taking his case all the way to the High Court . Following a series of cases and trials, a surprise Supreme Court ruling in 2009 ruled it was up to banks to decide whether overdraft charges were fair or unfair. The Office of Trading had taken on seven banks and one building society following the complaints of millions that they were being unfairly fined. At the time, most cases had been settled out of court with banks avoiding the possibility of having to change their policies. Lloyds was one of the banks involved in the dispute. After being bailed out at the height of the financial crisis, the part-tax-payer-owned company said it would treat cases individually and that anyone who was likely to receive money back from overdraft charges would have to be considered to suffer significant financial hardship. Thousands of disgruntled customers took their complaints to the Financial Ombudsman, which found many who hadn't been refunded were in financial hardship. But the Supreme Court ruled it was in the opinion of the bank to decide whether someone qualified for a refund. The Office for Trading said it was disappointed by the outcome.","Oliver Foster-Burnell won case against Lloyds Bank over unfair charges .

"A fake paramedic  jailed for tricking a terminally ill pensioner into thinking he was a real medical worker and even drove his own ambulance has been sent back to prison for 'befriending vulnerable people'. Joshua Martyn had bought a fully marked paramedic first response vehicle and medical equipment online, despite having never completed anything more than a basic first aid course. The 21-year-old from Hove, East Sussex, was jailed for 18 months in August after he admitted fraud and theft charges, but was released in September as he had served most of his sentence while on remand. Fake: Joshua Martyn (left), who bought a first response vehicle (right) and tricked pensioners into thinking he was a real paramedic, has been sent back to prison for 'befriending vulnerable people' However, he was returned to prison earlier this month after breaching his licence by 'befriending vulnerable people', Sussex Police said. Martyn first came to police attention in 2010 while pretending to be a paramedic. However, because it is not currently an offence to impersonate a health professional, police found there was little they could do to stop him. He was eventually arrested in September 2011 for fraud and assault on a 71-year-old woman he was living with in Crawley, according to police. Difficulties: Police said that because it is not currently an offence to impersonate a regulated health or care professional, they found it difficult to know how to deal with Martyn . He had moved in with the woman, convincing her that he was medically trained, but in reality had no such qualifications. In March 2012, he was convicted at Lewes Crown Court of using an uninsured and untaxed vehicle, three counts of battery in relation to the 71-year-old woman, and two counts of driving without a licence. He was sentenced to a six-month hospital order and banned from driving for six months. Kit: A stash of medical equipment used by the 21-year-old, who managed convince pensioners that he was a real paramedic . However, just two months later, police were told that he was staying with a couple in their 80s in West Hoathly, near East Grinstead, West Sussex, whose concerned family were not convinced he was a registered paramedic. Last March, Martyn was convicted of fraud and assault against a terminally ill 80-year-old man from West Hoathly but cleared of one charge of witness intimidation. He was sentenced to five months imprisonment at a youth offenders’ institution and given a restraining order banning him from contacting the 71-year-old woman in Crawley. He admitted further charges of fraud and theft when he appeared at Hove Crown Court in August this year, and received the 18 month prison sentence. 'Joshua Martyn adopted personas that put him in contact with vulnerable people and in a position of trust,' said Pc Jacqui Thornton. 'He was well known in the community and fooled people into thinking he was qualified to administer medical care. 'He dressed as a paramedic, drove a marked ambulance response vehicle and carried medical equipment. 'It is not currently an offence to impersonate a regulated health or care professional, therefore it was difficult to deal with Martyn’s activities and behaviour. 'It took me three years of investigation to obtain the evidence required to put Martyn before the court for various offences linked to his activities.' Pc Thornton said Martyn’s case was not the first of its kind and that she was working with the South East Coast Ambulance Service (Secamb) to raise awareness and to amend legislation which protects those who are vulnerable and those who need medical care. Paramedic David Davis said: 'This case specifically highlights a current inadequacy in the law in that it is not currently an offence to impersonate a paramedic, or for that matter a nurse, doctor, physiotherapist or a social worker. 'Members of the public can always check to see if their paramedic or other allied health professional or social worker is registered, by visiting the www.hcpc-uk.org or doctor www.gmc-uk.org or nurses/midwives www.nmc-uk.org.'","Joshua Martyn, 21, bought a first response vehicle and medical equipment .

"Thick and heavy cloud has killed-off the best views of Wednesday night's rare lunar eclipse as the highly anticipated event fizzled out in skies over Australia. The blood moon event, which  astronomers were promising would make for spectacular viewing, failed to live up to to the hype many were hoping as a band of high cloud blocked the best views. Despite the disappointment,  hundreds gathered at spots across the city hoping for a glimpse of the burgundy sphere. Scroll down for video . The blood  moon which appeared briefly over Australia on Wednesday night . The event failed to live up to the hype many were expecting when a band of high cloud blocked the moon . About 200 people  gathered around Sydney to watch the event unfold . About 200 people were at observatory hill, next to the Harbour Bridge, while about 50 gathered under the northern side of the central Sydney landmark. Professional and amateur photographers were about with lenses of all sizes, but their chances of snapping a clear shot of the event are slim due to thick, heavy low cloud. 'That doesn't help anyone see through it,' a Bureau of Meteorology spokesman told AAP. 'Ironically (Thursday) night is probably a much better night for viewing the sky, which tends to happen with these things sometimes.' Many were parked beneath the Harbour Bridge . At about 10pm a dull, dark beige moon briefly appeared, prompting members of the crowd to reach for their cameras. For those prepared to travel, the best spot to see the eclipse was the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, or further west. Astronomer Alan Duffy of Melbourne's Swinburne University of Technology says a lunar eclipse occurs when the earth moves between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow across the moon that causes it to turn a blood red colour. A lot of the country's east coast is affected by the cloud, but with a lunar eclipse happening at least twice a year stargazers shouldn't have to wait long for another chance to observe the phenomenon. And it's expected that seven will occur in 2038. West Australians will see the total eclipse, but will miss the entire passage of the earth's shadow across the face of the moon because the eclipse begins before the moon rises over the state. The eclipse is the second of four total lunar eclipses, starting with a first 'blood moon' on April 15, in a series astronomers call a tetrad. A slight tinge of red can be seen  hovering over the city of Sydney on Wednesday night . A red moon will be visible in Australia and other parts of the world on Wednesday . A senior lecturer at Queensland University of Technology explained: 'A blood Moon occurs when the orbit of the Moon is nearly perfectly aligned with the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. 'The simultaneous occurrence of all sunsets and sunrises on the rim of the Earth, make the Moon red.' With a small pair of binoculars people will also be able to spot Uranus about 'two moon widths away' from the the blood moon. The eclipse will happen two more times over the next two years as part of this cycle, on April 4 and September 28, 2015. The next Tetrad cycle won't occur until 2032. 'If we were on the moon during this eclipse, we would see a bright orange-red ring in the sky where the Earth should be. The light from that bright ring bathes the moon in a reddish glow, which we can see from Earth.' Dr Hughes explained. In this photo people watch as the 'Blood Moon' rises over the water in Williamstown, Melbourne, on April 15 . A blood moon occurs when the moon passes in to the shadow of Earth called the umbra . It is described as the 'simultaneous occurrence of all sunsets and sunrises' Some Christians are concerned that the celestial event could mark the start of terrible events, based on a passage from the Bible that says: 'The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord comes.' In 1493, the first Tetrad saw the expulsion of Jews by the Catholic Spanish Inquisition. The second happened in 1949, right after the State of Israel was founded and the most recent one - in 1967 - happened during the Six-Day War between Arabs and Israelis. John Hagee, a Christian pastor who has written a book on the Tetrad called 'Four Blood Moons: Something is About to Change' told the Daily Express that the first of the blood moons in 2014 took place right in the middle of the Jewish holiday of Passover. Dr Hughes said that 'anywhere down the East Coast' is the best place to view it . The second, on October 8, occurs during the Feast of the Tabernacle and the third will be on April 4, 2015, also during Passover. The final one happens on September 28, 2015, which is also during the Feast of the Tabernacles. A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it appears red. This gives rise to its 'blood red' appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. When the moon first enters the Earth's partial shadow, know as the penumbra, a dark shadow begins to creep across the moon. This gives the illusion that the moon is changing phases in a matter of minutes instead of weeks. At the eclipse's peak, the moon enters the Earth's full shadow; the umbra. At this stage, the Earth's atmosphere scatters the sun's red visible light; the same process that turns the sky red at sunset. As a result, the red light reflects off the moon's surface, casting a reddish rust hue over it.","Chances of snapping a clear shot of the event were slim due to thick, heavy and low cloud particularly over Sydney .
For those who were prepared to travel, the best spot to see the eclipse was Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, or further west.

"Just seven months after he left his post at Good Morning America to join the NBC Sports team, Josh Elliott seems to have landed a very big promotion. A grinning and giddy Elliott joined Matt Lauer, Al Roker and Hoda Kotb this morning as one of the four anchors on Today. The move comes just one month after his six month non-compete clause with ABC expired. Scroll down for video . Moving up: Josh Elliott (left) joined Hota Kotb, Matt Lauer and Al Roker (seen above with Tamron Hall and actor Jim Carrey) as one of the four anchors on Today this morning . Old gig: Elliott (above with Ginger Zee, Lara Spencer and Amy Robach) left his post at Good Morning America in March . Elliott was filling in for Natalie Morales, and assumed her news-reading duties throughout the morning. This is a big move up for Elliott, and something that will likely anger execs over at ABC. At the time of his departure from the rival network, it was said he would be working with NBC Sports, and would appear on Today only to do sports-related segments. This morning however, Elliott looked very comfortable filling in, bringing in some of the banter and humor that he used to help GMA topple Today in the ratings race starting back in April of 2012, after the show's 16 year run as the most watched morning news program. Thrilled: Elliott shared his excitement about hosting the morning news program on Twitter today . The show has continued to struggle in the ratings since then, pulling in just 4.7 million viewers the week of October 13 as opposed to Good Morning America's 5.4 million, this according to TV Newser. And while America has kept things simple with just four anchors, Robin Roberts, Lara Spencer, George Stephanopoulos, and Amy Robach, along with meteorologist Ginger Zee, on camera during the two hour program, Today now has nine anchors spread out over four hours of television, including Carson Daly, Willie Geist, Kathie Lee Gifford, Tamron Hall and Savanna Guthrie, in addition to Lauer, Roker, Morales and Kotb. Old pals: Elliot (right) and pal Sam Champion (middle) left GMA within months of one another, with Elliott being replaced by Robach (left) Personal life: Elliot (left) is engaged to NYC news anchor Liz Cho (second from right, seen with Jonathan Tisch and Champion) There is no word yet if Elliott will now be a permanent fixture on the show, or will just be stopping by in the absence of Morales. Elliott, who is engaged to New York City's ABC news anchor Liz Cho, wanted to get out of his gig at Good Morning America so badly that he reportedly took a pay cut to head over to NBC back on March 30. TMZ reported that Elliott felt slighted over the $14 million contract Roberts signed to stay on as anchor of the program, as he was only offered an annual salary somewhere between $4 and $5 million. Permanent gig: It is uncertain in Elliott will now be a regular fixture on Today, or just fill in when Natalie Morales is absent, as she was this morning . He ended up signing a contract for just over $3 million a year to go to NBC, with no promise he would ever be on Today. The move came just a few months after his good friend Sam Champion also left the program to take a job with The Weather Channel. Elliott was replaced by Robach while Champion was replaced by Zee.","Josh Elliott made his first appearance as a co-anchor on Today this morning, filling in for Natalie Morales .

"Ugandan police have arrested a man they suspect supplied fake drugs to Australian miner Christopher Kirkman, who was found dead in his Ugandan hotel room on Wednesday. Mr Kirkman was in transit in Entebbe, near the Ugandan capital Kampala, after he missed a connecting flight to Australia. He had been working in the Democratic Republic of Congo with Australian gold mining company, Byrnecut, since February 2013. It is believed he had gone out for a drink with a fellow Australian on Wednesday and collapsed later in his hotel room. Scroll down for video . Christopher David Kirkman, 30, was working for an Australian mining company, Byrnecut, at the Kibali goldmine in the Democratic Republic of Congo . Ugandan Police say initial investigations indicate Christopher Kirkman died from a drug overdose after being supplied with fake drugs . Ugandan metropolitan police spokesman Patrick Onyango said that preliminary investigations indicated Mr Kirkman died of a drug overdose and that he suffered from hypertension. The other Australian man was reportedly rushed to Entebbe hospital after he also collapsed, but police say that man was recovering after treatment. 'We have arrested one man who is alleged to have supplied the drugs to the Australian men,' the spokesman said. 'The one who was taken to hospital is out of danger. We are still carrying out our investigations.' Police suspect the supplied drugs were fake. Mr Kirkman had posted on Facebook on Wednesday that he was tired after missing his flight. 'Well that was an extremely long day, missed the connecting flight so looks like a big night tonight!' he posted on his Facebook wall. He had previously posted about flight delays from another Ugandan airport. A post-mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death. Duncan Bradford, Managing Director of Byrnecut, told the media Christopher had worked for the company since February 2013 and was in transit for his rostered leave in Australia. 'Byrnecut Offshore is in close contact with DFAT, local Ugandan authorities and Chris’s family and will assist with the repatriation of Chris’s body to Australia,' he said. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was providing consular assistance to the family of a 30-year-old Western Australian man who died in Uganda.

"Withholding the tip: The idea is contained in a new report for the mayor by Lord Darzi (pictured) Mothers who endure appalling care in an NHS maternity unit should be able to demand that the hospital receives a punitive fine, Boris Johnson will argue this week. The proposal, in a report commissioned by the London Mayor, is part of a drive to hand significant powers to patients – and take them away from NHS managers. Women would be able to ensure that 12.5 per cent of the payment hospitals receive for their birth should be withheld if they were not happy with their care. Hospitals are paid £2,200 for a normal birth, so under the proposals a woman who had a bad experience would be able to decide that £275 should be held back. The money held back would stay with local GP commissioners who pay for care, and would be put into a fund to be re-invested in higher quality maternity services. The shake-up is the brainchild of Lord Darzi, a pioneering surgeon and former Labour health minister who has written the London Health Commission report for Mr Johnson. The idea is to give new mothers the same powers over the NHS that they have in the rest of their lives, such as being able to withhold a tip if they suffer poor service in a restaurant. It follows mounting concern over the poor standard of NHS maternity wards, which is due in part to a shortage of at least 3,000 midwives. Last year the chief inspector of hospitals said thousands of women in labour are forced to endure ‘shocking and frightening’ ordeals because of failings in maternity units. A quarter of women who gave birth on the NHS last year said they were abandoned during labour and birth at a time that worried them – up from 22 per cent the year before. Four in 10 of those polled by the Care Quality Commission said they were not happy about the quality of care they received. Mr Johnson’s new report is written by the London Healthcare Commission, which he set up to look at ways to improve the NHS in the city – and, by extension, outside it. It comes two months after the Mayor published a report advocating exit from the EU if David Cameron cannot persuade Brussels to hand back enough powers. Sights on Westminster: The report is the mayor's second in two months which ranges into national politics . By ranging into health matters, the report will be seen as part of further leadership manoeuvres by Mr Johnson. Last night Mark Johnson, professor of obstetrics at Chelsea and Westminster hospital, welcomed the plans. ‘Making maternity budgets more responsive to the quality of care offered to our women is important,’ he said. ‘Such a shift in emphasis will promote the development of safe, woman-centred care, based on the best available evidence.’ In his report for Mr Johnson, Lord Darzi said: ‘Whilst the health service should always remain free at the point of need, the absence of payments from individuals is one of the reasons why care can sometimes be unresponsive to individual needs. ‘It must be possible to empower patients whilst remaining true to the NHS’s founding principle. That is why the Commission proposes to empower patients to control a proportion of the payment providers receive from NHS commissioners. ‘Personally-controlled payments would mean that individuals would be able to decide whether or not a hospital receives a portion of its income relating to that individuals’ care.’ Worries: A quarter of pregnant women in an NHS survey said they had been abandoned when they felt in need . Lord Darzi said deciding to pay would be entirely subjective and down to individual experience of care. ‘That is the point,’ she said. ‘The idea of personally-controlled payments is to make providers pay more attention to the lived experience of care. ‘They should be focused on areas of persistent poor performance.’ The report suggests the approach should be piloted in maternity care in London, where too much care is ‘stubbornly poor’. Maternity standards in the capital are among the worst in the country. Satisfaction rates are among the lowest, and more than half of women wait at least 12 weeks for an antenatal assessment. The maternal mortality rate in London is twice the rest of the UK, and has risen every year for the past five years. Seventy per cent of the direct maternal deaths were found to have shortfalls in care which, if managed differently, might have saved lives. If successful, it is hoped the plan could be extended across the whole of England. The report said: ‘Empowering mothers-to-be with personally-controlled payments for maternity care could dramatically improve their experiences of care and start a revolution in empowering Londoners in their relationship with the NHS.’ Lord Darzi was a practising cancer surgeon at St Mary’s Hospital and the Riyal Marsden Hospital, where he pioneers minimally invasive surgical techniques. He was knighted for his services to the NHS in 2002 and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Gordon Brown made him a Lord in 2007 and put him in the Department of Health as a minister. He was one of Mr Brown’s so-called ‘GOATs’ – standing for ‘Government Of All the Talents’.","Proposal is part of drive to hand powers from NHS managers to patients .

"The woman who gave birth to the world's first womb-transplant baby has revealed that she still cannot believe she is a mother – and hopes he will one day become a doctor. The 36-year-old woman discovered at 15 that she had no womb and was told she would never carry her own children - but was one of nine women to receive a transplanted womb last year in a trial. The Swedish parents, who want to remain anonymous, admitted that they had not yet worked out how they will tell their son that he made medical history when he is older. Scroll down for video . Cute: Vincent, the first baby born to a woman who had a womb transplant, is cradled by his mother in Sweden . Newborn: The parents of the baby say they hope they can be an inspiration to others struggling with infertility . Medical breakthrough: After what they describe as a rollercoaster of a journey, the unnamed Swedish couple finally became parents last month, when the mother gave birth to a healthy but premature baby boy . The mother said: ‘We will show him all the articles that were written and tell him everything we went through to get him. Maybe he will be inspired to become a doctor.’ The couple hope they can be an inspiration to others struggling with infertility, but say that is not why they did it. The mother added: ‘We're the first to do this, but that's not the important thing.’ The couple named their son Vincent, which means ‘to conquer’, to celebrate a victory over their difficult journey to parenthood. ‘He doesn't really scream, but he makes these funny little sounds,’ the mother said, comparing him to a kitten. Though his white wooden crib has a welcoming teddy bear and blankets, she said her son prefers to sleep between his parents in their bed. The father said the couple will be forever grateful to the 61-year-old woman who donated her uterus, the mother of one of his best friends. Explanation: The Swedish parents, who want to remain anonymous, admitted that they had not quite worked out how they will tell their son that he made medical history when he is older . Baby: The boy is soon to have company - with two more women who became pregnant after having transplants due in the next few weeks . Medical care: The happy couple named their son Vincent, which means 'to conquer', to celebrate a victory over their difficult journey to parenthood . Delighted parents: The father said the couple will be forever grateful to the 61-year-old woman who donated her uterus, the mother of one of his best friends . The woman - now the boy's godmother - made the offer after hearing about the difficulties the young couple was having in starting a family. ‘What she did for us was so amazing and selfless that the words “thank you” don't seem like enough,’ the father said. And the boy is soon to have company – with two more women who became pregnant after having transplants due in the next few weeks. It could be the start of a new wave of babies born this way, say the Swedish doctors who pioneered the technique. ‘It means a lot to me that we are able to help patients who have tried for so long to have families,’ said Dr Mats Brannstrom, a professor of gynaecology and obstetrics at the University of Gothenburg, who led the project that brought about last month's pioneering birth. Operation: Dr Mats Brannstrom and his team performing a womb transplant in Sweden . Trial: Specialist surgeons (from left) Andreas G Tzakis, Pernilla Dahm-Khler, Dr Brannstrom, Michael Olausson and Liza Johannesson attend a news conference at a hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden . ‘This is the last piece of the puzzle in finding a treatment for all women with infertility problems.’ Dr Brannstrom predicted there would soon be many more babies born to women who have received donated wombs in countries where doctors are studying the technique, including Australia, Britain, the US, Japan and China. He said he has also started work on trying to grow a womb in the lab. That involves taking one from a deceased donor, stripping it of its DNA and using cells from the recipient to line the structure. He has started preliminary tests in animals and estimated it would be another five years before the technique can be tried on humans. While that may sound like science fiction, the techniques that led to the birth announced last week also sounded outlandish just years ago.","Swedish mother aged 36 was told at 15 she'd never carry her own children .

"Faces covered in ash and paint, these are the Hindu holy men who live their lives away from everyday society. Known as sadhus, they shun all home comforts for a life of asceticism spent inside caves, forests and temples across India and Nepal. German banker and photographer Mario Gerth decided fulfil a long-held obsession by finding and photographing the religious devotees, known colloquially in India as Godmen.

Sadhus shun all home comforts for a life of asceticism spent inside caves, forests and temples . 'I have been obsessed with the sadhus for many years and set off in 2013 to look for them,' said the 38-year-old of Erfurt, Germany. 'In India, I found them in the hidden temples of crowded Delhi and on a bench alongside the holy river Ganga in Varanasi. They were also close to the Himalayan mountains in Nepal.' Mr Gerth embarked on a two month trip in search of the most intriguing sadhus to photograph in his portable studio. He visited them throughout India, in cities such as Calcutta, Varanasi and Delhi, and also in the Nepalese town of Kathmandu. 'Sadhus leave their home and family, and reject an earthly life, which includes all their worldly attachments,' he said. 'As part of this renunciation, they also leave behind their clothes, food and shelter. Instead, they rely on the generosity of others. 'Sadhus don't lead a normal life like others; they choose to live poorly and only find richness in spirit and humanity.'

Dedicated: Gangadas, left, and Bakti, right, who has twisted himself into a difficult looking yoga pose . Sadhus are people who have chosen to dedicate their lives to achieving religious illumination and liberation from the cycle of reincarnation. There are four to five million sadhus in India today and they are widely respected for their holiness, while also feared by some who believe they have the power to inflict curses. They frequently smoke cannabis which, although illegal for everyone else, is said to help them communicate with Shiva, on of the most popular Hindu gods. Mr Gerth said: 'I felt very excited during my journey. It was very new and thrilling as I was searching for them in hidden temples and down old streets. 'People are impressed by the colourfulness and uniqueness of these men. 'I have even been asked before, 'are they human?', which was one of the strangest reactions! 'I tried to find the ages of all the men I photographed, but I kept getting the same response. 'They all told me they don't care for age.' Sadhu men usually cover themselves with ash or chalk, and paint their faces in accordance with the god they have devoted themselves to. The ash represents their death to their worldly life.",Sadhus are people who have dedicated their lives to breaking the cycle of reincarnation .
"Two new witnesses could provide clues to the brutal bashing of Australian school teacher Robert Scott on a Californian street. The Fresno Police Department's murder-robbery unit was expected on Friday to hand evidence to prosecutors from a second investigation into the one-punch incident that left 26-year-old Mr Scott with a fractured skull, brain damage and in a coma for almost two months. Scott's family hired a lawyer, Benjamin Tryk, who conducted his own investigation this week after Fresno District Attorney's opted not to charge the man, Gilbert Romero, who knocked the Australian to the asphalt. Robert Scott (right) and girlfriend Amy Jarvis in the intensive care ward at a California hospital. Mr Scott has been in a coma for two months after an attack on a US street . Mr Tryk passed the names of the new witnesses he found to police. 'We will wait on re-submitting the case until we contact these two individuals,' Lieutenant Mark Salazar told AAP. Lt Salazar and Mr Tryk did not reveal the identity of the witnesses. 'We are confident that with all additional information provided to investigators in addition to evidence uncovered by Fresno PD in their ongoing investigation will lead to justice for the Scott Family and Robert,' Mr Tryk said. Mr Scott, a physical education teacher, champion rower and surf lifesaver from the mid-north NSW seaside town of Pacific Palms, was visiting a college friend in Fresno, 320km north of Los Angeles, on August 17. Mr Scott had been drinking from 11am, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.24, and was was walking along a residential street at 9pm with another friend, Norwegian tourist Helena Sordal when Mr Romero confronted him. Police said Mr Romero, who is an associate of Fresno's Bulldog gang, claimed Mr Scott yelled and swore at Mr Romero's girlfriend and their one-year-old son who were sitting in a parked car. Ms Sordal gave a different version, describing how Mr Scott only offered to help the woman and her child and when confronted by Mr Romero, had his hands down, backed away and said, 'I don't want any trouble'. The Australian teacher is fighting for life in hospital and has racked up more than $1 million in medical bills after suffering a fractured skull during an attack. He is pictured here with his father Stephen Scott . Mr Scott and his girlfriend Ms Jarvis before the brutal assault in Fresno, California . At least one of the new witnesses spoke to Mr Scott before he fell into a coma and Mr Scott described how he had been hit without provocation, Mr Tryk said. Mr Romero was arrested on August 26 for felony battery but released from custody after the district attorney did not file the charges citing potential self-defence and Scott's intoxication. Mr Scott was flown back to Sydney on a Lear jet last week and remains in a coma in Royal North Shore Hospital. The flight added to the already extremely high medical bills he accumulated in intensive care at Fresno's Saint Agnes Medical Centre, despite having travel insurance . But the insurance company might not pay the bills because he was drunk when he was hit. In a positive sign, he has begun to breathe on his own but his cognition has not improved since he left Fresno. Mr Scott's US hospitalisation and the flight back to Australia has cost more than $US1 million but his family hope his travel insurance will cover the bill.

"Furious railway staff called in police after discovering an airline's marketing team at one of their busiest stations - trying to lure their customers away. Managers at First Great Western were angered when they spotted Flybe workers at Exeter St David's train hub in Devon handing out coffees and promoting flights. The low-cost airline has just launched daily services from London to Exeter in direct competition to First Great Western rail services. Staff for the low-cost carrier turned up at 7am at the Devon station to promote the airline's new route (file) Flybe claim their Exeter to London City route is cheaper and quicker than the train, but First Great Western said they don't include the time to get to the airport and check-in and said rail is a 'strong alternative' on the service . As part of the promotional drive for the £60 return flights, they dispatched staff to stand outside the Exeter station to advertise the deal to commuters. Angry railway workers complained they did not have permission to stage the guerilla marketing drive and were causing an obstruction. British Transport Police confirmed they were called at 7am on October 23 after a complaint was made by station staff. The incident was eventually defused without any arrests although both sides have refused to back down following the spat which was dubbed 'transport wars' by travellers. First Great Western operates the only major rail route from Devon and Cornwall to London with tickets costing £93.50 for a return from Exeter to London. Flybe said it was 'regrettable' that First Great Western felt in necessary to contact the police as it was a 'free market' but railway managers said the airline's marketing team had 'inadvertently strayed onto our property' The new Flybe flights from Exeter to London City Airport are cheaper and quicker - taking 1hr 20 mins compared to 2hr 25 mins on the train. The company boasts of prices as low as £34.99 for a one-way ticket. Andrew McConnell, Flybe's director of communications, said: 'It is regrettable that in a commercial free market, First Great Western felt it necessary to contact the police to try to protect themselves from Flybe's offer of free coffee in a public space. 'Nothing's going to stop Flybe from being faster, cheaper and more punctual than rail travel.' First Great Western responded: 'We welcome healthy competition but Flybe's promotional team inadvertently strayed onto our property last week. 'Direct flights between Exeter and London are good news for the South West, providing those travelling with greater choices. 'However, with the time taken to check-in at Exeter International Airport and the distance the airport is to Exeter city centre, rail remains a strong, viable alternative - and the quickest way to travel.' British Transport Police said: 'We had received a complaint from station staff regarding representatives of Flybe operating at the station without permission, and a vehicle outside causing an obstruction. 'We spoke to both parties, and the staff representing Flybe agreed to leave the station.'","Flybe marketing staff were promoting carrier's new London to Exeter route .

"Keir Starmer said the idea that women were regularly crying rape when none had in fact taken place was 'damaging' the cause of justice . Rape and domestic violence are not being investigated properly by police because of a ‘misplaced belief’ that false allegations are rife, the Director of Public Prosecutions has warned. Keir Starmer said the idea that women were regularly crying rape when none had in fact taken place was ‘damaging’ the cause of justice. A study published today by the Crown Prosecution Service shows only a handful of false allegations of rape were made in 2011 and 2012. Mr Starmer said: ‘Because people recognise the devastating effect of false allegations and because they perceive there to be more false allegations than this report would suggest there are, arguably they adopt a cautious approach. ‘That can lead to injustice for victims.’ The study reveals that over a 17-month period between January 2011 and May 2012 – when all false allegation cases were referred to the DPP – there were 5,651 prosecutions for rape, but only 35 for making false allegations of rape. Likewise, there were 111,891 prosecutions for domestic violence, but only six for making false allegations of domestic violence. A further three people were charged with making false allegations of both rape and domestic violence. Furthermore, the study found that a significant number of the false allegation cases involved ‘young, often vulnerable people, and sometimes even children’. Around half were brought forward by people aged 21 and under, with some involving people with mental health difficulties. ‘From the cases we have analysed, the indication is that it is extremely rare that a suspect deliberately makes a false allegation of rape or domestic violence purely out of malice,’ Mr Starmer added. ‘It is within this context that the issue should be viewed, so that myths and stereotypes around these cases are not able to take hold.’ A report into Jimmy Savile says the shamed BBC star's sexual abuse could have been stopped as early as 1964 if police had not dismissed his victims' complaints and mishandled evidence . Earlier this week a separate report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary showed how police mishandled allegations against Jimmy Savile – in many cases because they did not believe the reports of his victims. The report concluded the shamed BBC star’s sexual abuse could have been stopped as early as 1964 if police had not dismissed his victims’ complaints and mishandled evidence. The latest report by the CPS is the first of its kind. It is part of a wider programme to improve the agency’s handling of cases involving violence against women and girls. In the foreword to the report, Mr Starmer writes that victims of rape and domestic violence ‘must not be deterred from reporting the abuse they have suffered’ by popular misconceptions about rape and domestic violence. ‘In recent years we have worked hard to dispel the damaging myths and stereotypes that are associated with these cases,’ he said. ‘One such misplaced belief is that false allegations of rape and domestic violence are rife. This report presents a more accurate picture.’ Mr Starmer last week announced radical measures in the way the criminal justice system tackles child sexual abuse to prevent ‘another Savile moment in five or ten years’ time’. He will replace the 19 practice guidelines that have been introduced over the past ten years with a single policy for England and Wales. The raft of measures is intended to ‘draw a line in the sand’ in the way child sex offenders are handled by the authorities. Mr Starmer said prosecutors and police will now be expected to ‘explore patterns of behaviour and links to other cases’ instead of just focusing on the account of the victim.","Only a handful of false allegations of rape were made in 2011 and 2012 .

"Pregnant would-be glamour model Josie Cunningham has told how she was so disappointed when she found out she was expecting a third boy, she drowned her sorrows in wine and cigarettes. The 24-year-old mother of two, whose baby is due in October, said she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted' to discover it wasn't the little girl she'd hoped for. And she admitted that she wouldn't have done it if she'd been carrying a girl. Scroll down for video . Opening up: Josie Cunningham appeared on This Morning with hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langford today . Miss Cunningham, who has boys aged six and three, said she was 'gutted' to find out her baby was a boy . Miss Cunningham, of Leeds, who already has boys of six and three, told the Mirror: 'The evening I found out the sex of the baby was when I lit up my first cigarette... 'I knew it could harm my child but it didn't stop me.  Deep down I know I wouldn't be smoking or drinking if I knew I was having a girl.' She said she was now smoking 20 a day. Her controversial comments came after she said she wanted to pay the NHS back for her boob job, not out of a sense of duty but in an attempt to stop people confronting her. Miss Cunningham, who has sold tickets to watch her give birth to her third child in October for a total of £30,000, insisted her £4,800 breast enlargement was medically necessary. But she told This Morning hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langford that she intended to give the money back to taxpayers, who also footed the £6,000 bill for the taxis that Miss Cunningham took on the school run, in an attempt to deflect vitriol from strangers. She said: 'I do want to pay back the NHS not because I feel I have to - because like I say, I have a medical condition - but because I just want people to back off.' Pregnant: Miss Cunningham said she suffered from 'severe anxiety' which meant she couldn't take the bus . Miss Cunningham, who lives in Leeds, said her breast operation was needed because she had 'no breast tissue at all'.  And she said she needed taxis for the school run rather than taking the bus because she feared abuse from strangers. The mother of boys aged six and three, who said she had worked from the age of 15, said: 'I got my taxi funded by Leeds City Council for a short period because I'm suffering with severe anxiety, which is something a lot of people go through. 'This anxiety stems from me raising my children on my own... it comes from my fear of people confronting me in front of my children.' Today she said her decision to sell tickets so people could watch her give birth was better than 'sitting at home and claiming benefits' and said: 'It's not much different to [reality labour ward show] One Born Every Minute. Hard talk: The This Morning hosts quizzed Miss Cunningham about why she had become so unpopular . 'They'll not be sat down there with a camera - I will have someone for protection.  People will be vetted.' And when asked by Holmes why 'people hate you', she said blamed her aspiration to become a glamour model. 'I think it's not because I had my breasts done on the NHS but because of my career path - I aspire to be a glamour model,' she said. 'Any woman growing up with no breast tissue is going to want to get them out for anyone.' She also said that her baby's father would not be at the birth, saying that 'We speak [but] we're not really in a good place at the moment.' During an #AskJosie Q&A session on Twitter last night , the 24-year-old from Leeds who is best known for having a breast enlargement on the NHS, had to defend herself against furious strangers angry about her use of public money. One accused Miss Cunningham, a mother of two who is expecting her third child in October, of wasting NHS funds, while another accused her of 'failing Britain'. Josie Cunningham, 23, who sold tickets to watch the birth of her third child, faced abuse on Twitter last night . Not happy: This angry tweet to Miss Cunningham was typical of those sent during the #AskJosie Q&A session . The angry tweets poured forth all night, but Miss Cunningham barely managed to answer more than a dozen . Miss Cunningham started the session last night with the tweet: 'Sorry guys, today's been manic. Get your questions in and I'll do #AskJosie in the next 25 minutes (10pm) Sorry it's later than expected!' She was then asked: 'We have a 30min drive to our nearest A&E. Do you think the money wasted on you could be spent better? Answers: a) Yes or b) Yes'. Miss Cunningham replied: 'Money wasn't wasted on me, I had a medical condition.' Another said: 'How does it feel to know you make so many people feel angry on a daily basis? 'You have failed Britain... well done.' And another tweeted: 'Why do people like you get so much attention and money spent on you when people are struggling to live because of poverty?' Miss Cunningham had no answer for that one. The scale of the vitriol was influenced by Miss Cunningham's decision earlier this week to sell four tickets to watch her give birth at home, which she said had sold out in 14 minutes, raising £30,000. Miss Cunningham was accused of 'wasting' public money but insisted her boob job was medically necessary . Yesterday morning, Miss Cunningham announced to her 27,000 Twitter followers that tickets for her home birth had sold out in 14 minutes. Three of the four tickets were apparently purchased by journalists, while the fourth is said to have been bought by a 'super-fan' named Paul Mills-Ash. Mr Mills-Ash, who spent his savings on the ticket, told Closer: 'I've followed Josie since she came into the public eye. It'll be great to say I was at the birth.' This tweet boasting about making money from charging people to watch her give birth prompted vitriol . Two people are said to have paid £10,000 each, while Mr Mill-Ash and one other paid £5,000 for their ringside seats. The more expensive tickets will enable the holders, said to be journalists, to film the birth and take photos, while the cheaper ones will include travel and accommodation. A spokesman for Miss Cunningham insisted ticket-holders would be vetted to ensure no-one 'dodgy' was admitted. Miss Cunningham has suggested that she might use some of the money to repay the NHS for her breast operation. Miss Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD. She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. She courted further publicity when she said she was considering aborting the child she is now pregnant with so that she could take part in the Celebrity Big Brother reality TV show. Never one to shy away from controvery, Miss Cunningham has built her career on winding people up . Miss Cunningham later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. Eventually Leeds City Council decided to axe the service, which prompted Ms Cunningham to Tweet: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me.’ She said: 'If the council think I’m getting a bus, they can think again.' Initially, Miss Cunningham had planned to cash in on the birth of her son by selling DVDs of the event through a chain of pound shops.","Josie Cunningham, 24, from Leeds, is expecting her third child in October .

"An American tourist who was attacked in Rio de Janeiro was gang raped in front of her boyfriend, it emerged yesterday. The young woman and the Frenchman were apparently subjected to a six-hour ordeal by three men after flagging down a public transit van in the Brazilian city. The horrific crime has sparked fear among visitors to the metropolis, which is set to host next year's football World Cup as well as the 2016 Olympics. Scroll down for video . Suspects Wallace Aparecido Souza Silva, left, Carlos Armando Costa dos Santos, center, and Jonathan Foudakis de Souza are presented to the press at the Special Police Unit for Tourism Support (DEAT) Jonathan Froudakis de Souza (left) and Wallace Aparecido Silva (right) have been accused of raping an American tourist on a minibus in Rio de Janeiro . Police have said a male foreign tourist was also held captive and robbed on the minibus . A few minutes after the pair of . tourists boarded the mini-bus on Friday night, the operators ordered the . other passengers to get off and inflicted a 'party of evil' on the . couple. The three assailants took turns . raping the woman and beating the man, whom they handcuffed and sometimes . struck with a metal crowbar, police investigator Alexandre Braga said . yesterday. The men split up the driving, ending . up in Rio's sister city of Niteroi across, where they went on a spending . spree with the foreigners' credit cards. Once they hit the limit on both . cards, spending around $500 at gas stations and convenience stores, the . suspects drove the pair back to Rio and forced the woman to fetch . another credit card, Mr Braga said. He said that she did not dare call . for help at this point 'because the young man was still under the . suspects' control and she feared something even worse might happen to . him'. Around six hours after they were . kidnapped, the tourists - both in their early 20s - were dumped by the . side of highway 30 miles away from Rio. They managed to reach a consulate, . where staff helped them contact police. The woman has returned home, . while the man is still in Brazil helping officers with their inquiries. Wallace Aparecido Souza Silva, Carlos . Armando Costa dos Santos and Jonathan Foudakis de Souza have been . arrested on suspicion of the crime. 'The victims recognised the three . without a shadow of a doubt,' Mr Braga said. The men's mug shots were . also recognised by another woman who said she'd been raped by the three . under similar circumstances last month. Two of the suspects have confessed to Saturday's attack, while the third denies any responsibility. Left to right: Jonathan Froudakis de Souza, Carlos Armando Costa dos Santos and Wallace Aparecido Silva, who allegedly raped a foreign tourist in a minibus in Rio de Janeiro on March 30, 2013 . It has been reported that the woman and man boarded the minibus in the Copacabana beach district in Rio de Janeiro early on Saturday . Many are now asking whether Rio . authorities, who have succeeded in cracking down on much of the city's . drug violence, are up to the task of protecting the waves of tourists . expected to flood the city during the World Cup and Olympics. Some 2million people are also . expected to flock to the city in late July for World Youth Day, a Roman . Catholic pilgrimage that Pope Francis is scheduled to attend. Observers said the attack came as a . particular shock given that safety has improved at least in the city's . tourist-friendly seaside neighbourhoods. 'No one expects to be attacked in . Disneyland, handcuffed and roughed up,' said Alfredo Lopes, the head of . the hotel association. 'Copacabana is our Disneyland.' Three men boarded the minibus after the woman and her boyfriend got on and forced all the other passengers off, Rio police said . Police have said a Brazilian woman who was raped a week earlier has also identified the suspects . The suspects allegedly rented their . van, which seats about a dozen people and has dark tinted windows, from . the vehicle's owner, who has not been linked to the attack. Rio's van services are widely reviled . for their precarious safety conditions and reckless driving, as well as . their links to organised crime. Some vans are run by militias largely . composed of former police and firemen who control large swaths of the . city's slums and run clandestine transportation and other services. In . general, tourists avoid the vans and opt for regular buses or taxis. Australian visitors Emma Richardson . and Jason Sestic said they have been taking extraordinary precautions . throughout their weeklong stay in Rio. 'We've stayed well away from . Copacabana and the beach areas at night,' Mr Sestic said. 'I'm a pretty . paranoid person in general and I've heard enough stories about here to . be really paranoid.'

"You can follow anyone home in a New York City taxi - virtually at least. On October 4, 2013, at 1:21pm, Katherine Heigl took a cab from Manhattan's West Side and got out near Penn Station at 1:40pm. The trip cost $14.50 and she left a $3.62 tip. By contrast, on May 21, Emma Roberts and fiance Evan Peters got into a taxi on Park Avenue and got dropped off about a mile east. $6.50 fare but only a $1 tip. Scroll down for video . Generous: On October 4, 2013, Katherine Heigl went from 80 N Moore Street to 421 8th Avenue, near Madison Square Garden, and tipped $3.62 on a $14.50 fare, about 25 percent . Midtown: Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick rode from 246 Spring Street to 1412 6th Ave from 12:11 to 12:36pm on November 4, 2013, paying a $16.50 fare and tipping $3.40 . Gawker reports that this look into the travel patterns of celebrities in New York comes not from an overenthusiastic paparazzo but from a very revealing set of data available from the city. The Taxi and Limousine Commission compiles data from every ride taken during the year—there were 173million in 2013 alone—recording fare, tip, pickup and dropoff locations and more. Though the city tried to make it difficult to track individual taxis, a handful of determined data scientists cracked the code and made it possible to search for any ride by knowing the time, location and medallion number. Thanks to Anthony Tockar, who wrote about the dataset at his internship with analytics firm Neustar, we now know it's possible to know where celebrities were headed when they hopped in a yellow cab. By using photos from paparazzi and gossip blogs from 2013 where celebrities were seen getting in and out of cars, Tockar took the medallion numbers that were visible and IDed taxis in the dataset using the time of the pickup or dropoff. From there, the rest of the route information could be gleaned, and the data could be compared against another set outlining fare and tip information to give a full picture of the celeb's ride. For instance, on July 8, 2013, Bradley Cooper was photographed getting into a cab along the west side of Manhattan at 7:34pm. Using the dataset, Tockar found he headed from there to the West Village and got dropped off near posh eatery Melibea, a 10-minute ride that cost $10.50. Village: Ashlee Simpson took a taxi from 78 Crosby Street to 580 Hudson Street from 3:29 to 3:38pm on January 6, 2013, a $7.50 fare that she left a $2 tip on . West: Amanda Bynes got into a taxi on April 11, 2013 at 229 W 28th Street at 5:43pm and got off at 271 W 47th Street at 6:02pm. She paid the $13 fare in cash and the tip was not recorded . Village: On June 21, 2013, from 11:28 to 11:35am, Judd Apatow rode with Leslie Mann north in the West Village to One Abingdon Square, and the pair paid a $7 fare with a $2.10 tip . Crosstown: Olivia Munn trekked across the island from 225 Varick Street to 325 Bowery at 11:20am on July 8, 2013, paying a $6 fare in cash, with the tip not recorded . West-sider: Bradley Cooper heads out from 376 Greenwich Avenue before getting out at 13 Bank Street near eatery Melibea on July 8, 2013, paying his $10.50 fare in cash, with the tip not recorded . The data also revealed what celebrities tipped when they paid for their rides with a card. Though Roberts and Evans may have been towards the stingy side, most celebrities chipped in close to 20 percent or more. When people paid with cash, the tip was often not recorded so there's no way to know if the celebs threw in a generous bonus or stiffed their drivers completely. The news that people can hack the 2013 dataset fairly easily knowing only a taxicab's medallion number has unsettled some, in spite of the data being a year old. The other option, take an Uber. But according to Valleywag, the Silicon Valley ridesharing startup was revealed to have its own problem keeping data under wraps, after venture capitalist Peter Sims found his ride use being watched by guests at a company party for their amusement. NoHo to Midtown: Jessica Biel took a cab from 342 Bowery at 2:52pm to 8 E 23rd Street at 3:07pm on May 6, 2013, and recorded a $11.50 fare, with the tip amount unknown . West side: Model Karolina Kurkova took a cab on June 26, 2013, from 112 Hudson Street to 624 W 26th Street from 11:23 to 11:32pm, paying a $10 fare and a $2 tip . Splurge: Emma Roberts and fiance Evan Peters took a ride from 875 Park Ave at 2:46pm to 533 E 84th Street at 2:53pm on May 21, 2013, with a $6.50 fare, though they only tipped $1 .","The routes of Katherine Heigl, Bradley Cooper, Kourtney Kardashian, Ashlee Simpson, Emma Roberts and more could be found by using taxi medallion numbers from paparazzi photos .

"Right as rain: Karina Chikitova, 3, who survived 12 days and nights in Siberian woodland has been discharged from hospital . A three-year-old girl who survived a dozen days and nights alone in the Siberian wilderness has been discharged from hospital with a clean bill of health. Karina Chikitova's amazing rescue from thick forest where bears and wolves roam saw her story go round the world after she was plucked to safety last month. Now after five weeks undergoing checks in two Russian hospitals, she is going home to her remote village in the Sakha Republic to be reunited with Naida, the puppy who saved her life. The dog . stayed with Karina, keeping her warm in chilly night temperatures, and . then after more than a week went back to her village, exhausted and . hungry, to try and summon help. 'In . late July, Karina had followed her father Rodion into the taiga from . their far-flung village, though he was unaware she did so. Then she got . hopelessly lost, even though when was only a few kilometres from her . home,' reported The Siberian Times. Her . grandmother who was looking after her was convinced her father had . taken her with him to stay in a far-flung village where there was no . phone contact. It took several days for her horrified mother Aitalina to discover that she was lost. A huge search began in the Sakha Republic, the largest region in Russia, only slightly smaller than India. When she was rescued - she was lying in a grassy hole - her face was covered in mosquito bites and she was desperately weak. She drank water from rivers, and ate wild berries, but was badly undernourished. Medics . worked to help her regain her weight and checked she had not picked up . any illnesses - but she has been given a clean bill of health. Her . doctor at the City Children's Hospital, in Yakutsk, Fedora Gogoleva, . said: 'We did not ask her too much about what happened. She tries to . forget it. We asked only how she slept, how she feels. 'Her appetite has improved, she gained weight and feels good. She also talked with our psychologist here.' Scroll down for video . Lucky: Rescuers hold little Karina Chikitova who survived eating wild berries and drinking river water . The doctor claimed that her Siberian . upbringing, going into the forest with her grandmother to pick berries, . meant she was not daunted, nor did she feel any risks. 'The . family live far away in a remote village, not in the city, and it makes . its mark,' she said. 'She was raised close to nature. 'Certainly . she went with grandmother and parents to the forest, to gather berries. Perhaps this is why she was not afraid of the forest. 'Karina herself is a very strong girl, has a strong-willed character. This probably helped her to survive.' Found: The small girl is found sitting in the long grasses which are common in the south-west of the Sakha Republic . The little girl's face peers out from the long grasses in the Siberian taiga where she was found . Wonder dog: Naida the puppy stayed with Karina, keeping her warm in chilly night temperatures, and then after more than a week went back to her village, exhausted and hungry, to try and summon help . She . added: 'The girl is communicative, active, her emotions are positive. She gets along well with other children, plays with them. Especially . with her new friend Gena. 'She is quite independent, talks like an adult and we think that she is well brought up.' Lyubov Kolesova, her occupational therapist, said: 'She doesn't say and remember much about this accident. 'She . talks about how lovely her mother is and about her home. She says what . she likes, which colours and animals, All her pictures are colourful. You can see she is a  talented, creative person.' Checkups: Medics worked to help Karina regain her weight and checked she had not picked up any illnesses - but she has been given a clean bill of health . The doctor claimed that Karina's Siberian . upbringing, going into the forest with her grandmother to pick berries, . meant she was not daunted, nor did she feel any risks . She made a picture of an elephant at the hospital's kindergarten. Her mother Talina said that she had been gathering hay the fields on the day Karina disappeared. 'Karina . was being cared for by her granny,' she said. 'My husband left on a . trip to another village and she was convinced he had taken Karina with . him.' Rescuers have revealed that while Naida came to summon help, she was little use in finding her way back to Karina. Nor were the sniffer dogs, which are trained to find people, not dog trails. A psychologist with the rescue team said the girl's mind had not been hurt and that she was acting normally . Karina survived by drinking water from rivers and eating berried but she was still badly undernourished when she was rescued . 'The forest around Olom is full of bears,' said rescuer Albert Semyonov, who revealed his men needed armed guards in looking for Karina. 'Close to the gunners we felt somehow calmer. However, the thought of bears immediately switched to another concern: somewhere in the forest was this helpless child.' The breakthrough came when rescuers found Karina's footprint on the bank of a river when she had gone to drink water. Next to her print, was the paw mark of a dog. This gave rescuers hope they were in the right area, and next day found Karina.

"A gambler who is suing Britain’s oldest gaming club for withholding his £7.3million payout is  facing a hefty demand himself – for the return of £5.9million he won at an American casino. Poker star Phil Ivey’s extraordinary dispute with Mayfair club Crockfords – which accused him of ‘reading’ the cards during a game of punto banco two years ago – reaches the High Court tomorrow. It has now emerged the 38-year-old multi-millionaire, dubbed the Tiger Woods of poker, is embroiled in an near-identical legal fight with Atlantic City casino Borgata. Unlike Crockfords, Borgata paid him his winnings in 2012, but is now suing for their return, arguing that he cheated. But Mr Ivey’s lawyers say ‘each and every penny’ was the ‘result of sheer skill’. Controversy: Poker king Phil Ivey is suing Britain's oldest gaming club, Mayfair's Crockfords . Before that case is resolved, however, Mr Ivey is due to give evidence in the High Court in the biggest legal battle in casino history. California-born Ivey is said to be relishing the opportunity to explain to a judge why he deserves his winnings. Both cases hinge on the use of what many gamblers argue is a legitimate technique called ‘edge sorting’. Mr Ivey says in his claim that it is commonly used by ‘advantage players’ – those who use legal ways to gain a mathematical advantage over a casino. In London and Atlantic City he was accompanied by a Chinese associate, a poker player now understood to be Cheng Yin Sun, also known as Kelly. Like Mr Ivey, she denies cheating. She helped Mr Ivey to exploit tiny flaws in the cards’ design – asymmetrical pattern differences on the back that are the result of mistakes during the manufacturing process. Mr Ivey's disputes hinge on the use of what gamblers argue is a legitimate technique called 'edge sorting' In his High Court claim, Mr Ivey’s lawyers say: ‘During the second session on August 20 [Mr Ivey] made various requests for decks of cards to be changed at the end of hands with which [Crockfords] chose to comply. ‘This continued until Kelly identified a deck, or decks of cards, where the pattern on the reverse side of the cards was asymmetrical (in that one “long” side was different from the opposite side). ‘Kelly would ask the dealer to reveal each card in turn by lifting the edge furthest from the dealer so  Kelly could identify whether the card was a seven, eight or nine – the key cards in punto banco. ‘The first time Kelly identified a key card, she told the dealer it was a “good” card which she wanted the dealer to rotate in the opposite direction to  all the other cards . . . In this way, the long edges  of the key card became distinguishable from  those of the other cards.’","Phil Ivey's battle with Mayfair club Crockfords hits the High Court tomorrow .

The husband's lawyer Helene Poivey-Leclercq said after the hearing: 'Everyone agreed there had been no physical infidelity, but the judge  considered that the act of seeking an extra-marital relationship was  offensive behaviour towards the husband. 'French law states that spouses owe each other mutual respect, fidelity  and help. It was in this notion of respect that the wife had failed.' A survey last month revealed that a fifth of people aged 18-35 have secretly used dating websites behind their partner’s back while in a relationship. According to a new study, 21 per cent of coupled-up people in the UK between the ages of 18 and 35 have used dating apps or websites without their partner’s knowledge. Respondents were initially asked ‘Have you ever used dating websites?’ to which 58 per cent said that ‘yes’ they had, whilst the remaining respondents claimed not to have done so. They were then asked ‘Have you ever used a dating website or app whilst in a relationship?’ to which 21 per cent of all respondents said that ‘yes’, they had in the past. A further 14 per cent, one in seven, admitted that they had used a dating website or app while in their ‘current relationship’. The most commonly used dating websites amongst those in relationships were Plenty of Fish (43 per cent), followed by the dating app Tinder (37 per cent) while 29 per cent even paid to be members of Match.com.","'Nathalie' was deemed to have cheated despite never meeting the men .

"Scores of officers from the Ministry of Defence police are under investigation for allegedly skipping vital security patrols and even taking naps while on duty at a nuclear bomb factory. As many as 50 officers are involved in the inquiry, which centres around security failures at a branch of the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Burghfield, Berkshire. There are claims that some were even sleeping on the job at the 225-acre complex, where technicians build Trident nuclear warheads. Nuclear weapons factory: As many as 50 Ministry . of Defence Police officers are involved in an inquiry into alleged . security failures at a branch of the Atomic Weapons Establishment at . Burghfield, Berkshire (pictured) The MoD has reported . the allegations to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. It . added that seven officers have resigned without facing disciplinary . charges. A source told the . Daily Mirror: 'At least some of the police were sleeping on the job when . they missed the patrols. This is highly embarrassing at such a key . facility.' Protests are . regularly held - and arrests made - at the massive high-security complex . near Reading, one of two sites where the ballistic missile warheads . have been built, maintained and decommissioned since 1992. Peter . Burt, of atomic weapons campaign group the Nuclear Information Service, . called the accusations against the armed policemen supposed to be . guarding the sensitive site complex 'astonishing'. 'The . government never misses an opportunity to tell us how sites like this . are at constant risk from terrorists,' he told the paper. 'It's clear there have been problems with security and supervision at a high level.' Armed and dangerous: The MoD called in the . Independent Police Complaints Commission after officers were accused of . failing to complete patrols and sleeping on the job at the highly . sensitive site near Reading . The MoD denied claims that staff were being investigated for sleeping on the job. The . spokesman said that disciplinary action was immediately initiated due . to the seriousness of nuclear security and where appropriate, officers . have been removed from the site to other duties pending the conclusion . of the misconduct investigation. The . MoD spokesman added: 'We can confirm a number of officers are under . investigation for failing to complete their full patrols at the Atomic . Weapons Establishment. 'The . investigation is ongoing and the Independent Police Complaints . Commission has been notified. It would be inappropriate to comment . further while the case is ongoing, however we can be clear that at no . point was the security of the site or its nuclear assets compromised.' The . spokesman said security at AWE sites is constantly reviewed and . Ministry of Defence Police will work to ensure that any improvements . needed as a result of the investigation are implemented. The allegations only relate to a small proportion of the patrolling requirement at the site, the spokesman added. Distinct . from the Royal Military Police, which is drawn from the Army, the MoD . police is a 2,700-strong civilian force which guards military and . 'Critical National Infrastructure' sites across the country.

"Dianne Staniforth, 51, discovered her husband Paul had been unfaithful after seeing a text message on his phone . A mother set herself on fire to teach her cheating husband 'a lesson for having a one-night stand', an inquest has heard. Dianne Staniforth, 51, discovered her husband Paul had been unfaithful after seeing a text message on his phone. An inquest in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, heard she then decided to 'teach him a lesson' and set herself on fire. The coroner was then told she set fire to herself while her husband and their two children were upstairs in bed. Mr Staniforth said he was woken by the sound of her screaming and leapt out of bed to find her staggering up the stairs ‘like a fireball’. He told the inquest in Chesterfield, Derbyshire: 'I heard a scream like I’d never heard before. I jumped out of bed and heard the screaming again. 'I met Dianne coming up the stairs. She was on fire, the hottest, brightest thing I’ve ever seen.' Mr Staniforth said he pushed his wife into the bathroom and began running cold water over her body while her daughter, 15, dialled 999. Mrs Staniforth, who worked as a civil servant at the Department of Work and Pensions, was rushed to Sheffield Hospital and then to a burns unit at Pinderfields Hospital, Wakefield, West Yorkshire . She suffered third degree burns to 70 per cent of her body and died six days after the incident on Sunday, April 28 last year. Her husband suffered serious burns to his hands. Pc Michelle Witham told the coroner: 'On arrival at hospital Mrs Staniforth was taken for resuscitation. 'Later she beckoned me over and asked ""where are my kids?"". I told her they were okay and not to worry.' The police officer then said that Mrs Staniforth told her she had set fire to herself to 'teach her husband a lesson' after finding out he was having 'an affair'. An inquest in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, heard Mrs Staniford (pictured here with her husband in happier times) then decided to 'get her own back' The police officer then said that Mrs Staniforth told her she had set fire to herself to 'teach her husband a lesson' after finding out he was having 'an affair' The court heard how Mrs Staniforth had taken an overdose in October 2012. Mr Staniforth said in the six months before her death his wife had threatened to kill herself between 30 and 40 times. He said: 'I’d remove tablets and wine and lock the doors to stop Dianne going out. 'If she got out she would go and get more wine or sit by the railway lines.' Mr Staniforth, a business consultant, said he wanted to separate from his wife. Mr Staniforth said in the six months before her death his wife had threatened to kill herself between 30 and 40 times . He added: 'Dianne didn’t want me to leave and said she would kill herself but I never thought she would do anything like this.' Mrs Staniforth’s sister Julie Baird said on April 22, Dianne sent her a text saying: 'Paul slept with someone else. I’m done now, I don’t want to live.' Mrs Baird urged her sister to leave her husband and build a new life. She added: 'I don’t think she would have wanted to kill herself. She loved her children and I don’t think she would have wanted to leave them.' Recording a verdict of misadventure, assistant coroner Paul McCandless said: 'She inflicted these burns upon herself in an effort to get back at her husband, but not in order to bring about her own death.'

"While some schools are increasingly draconian in their approach to playground supervision, this one has removed supervision altogether. Every day, during recess and lunchtime, school principal Bruce McLachlan lets his students at Swanson school in Auckland do as they please. This entails riding scooters down stairs, climbing upside down on trees and building their own three story huts. Swanson school is taking part in a University study on alternative methods to combat obesity and bullying in the school yard . Students playing on a makeshift hut: The children do as they please during recess and lunchtime . Swanson principal Bruce McLachlan says 'We were asked to take part in the study three years ago with seven other schools, and we haven't looked back' It's part of a University study on alternative methods to combat obesity and bullying in the school yard, and Mr McLachlan is adamant that it's combating both. 'We were asked to take part in the study three years ago with seven other schools, and we haven't looked back,' Mr McLachlan says. 'We've seen a marked reduction in schoolyard injuries and instances of bullying. We're seeing less kids with grazed knees and less kids going to the time out room. And with this in mind, we've gone from six teachers on the schoolyard to one or two.' 'It's very simple really: rather than telling kids what we can and can't do, we turn a blind eye. We remove adults from the equation.' Swanson students ride scooters and skateboards and play on makeshift huts in the schoolyard. And yet they are have less injuries than before he introduced the system. 'The kids are  learning to manage their risks. The child riding his bike around the playground is actively making sure he doesn't run into anyone,' he says. 'The kids using the mudslide are bringing a change of clothes to school, because they know they are going to need that when lunchtime is over.' Swanson students ride scooters and skateboards in the schoolyards, and yet there is a reduction in injuries . Mr McLachlan says: 'We have an underlying assumption that kid left unsupervised will hurt themselves, but I believe that's underestimating what kids are capable of' Mr McLachlan  says the system of letting his students do as they please in the playground is resulting in greater focus in the classroom . 'We have an underlying assumption that kid left unsupervised will hurt themselves, but I believe that's underestimating what kids are capable of.' Mr McLachlan says the approach is more effective in the long-term. 'It's better for them to learn at that age than behind the wheel at 18, when there are suddenly no adults around.' He also claims says the system is helping in the classroom. 'We're seeing kids returning to class with more focus, which is fantastic. In the end of the day, the kids are a lot happier, and that makes for a much better teaching environment.' 'What we're seeing these days in bubble wrap parenting, and it means kids aren't learning as much as they could be. Learning is much for effective when the kids are involved.' The results of the study, which is a joint venture from the University of Otaggo and the Aucklund University of Technology will be released later this year.

The Utah parole board will . decide later whether MacNeill can be released after 17 years or must . serve a longer term. The one-time doctor and lawyer with a family of eight remained silent during sentencing. 'Mr. MacNeill, as you deprived Michele MacNeill of her life, the state of Utah exacts from you today the liberty that you otherwise might have enjoyed in your remaining years,' Pullan said. Martin MacNeill's daughter Alexis Somers wipes a tear from her face after speaking to the court during her father's sentencing Friday . Michele . MacNeill initially was ruled to have died of natural causes, possibly . heart disease, but her family hounded authorities until charges were . filed five years after her death. A sobbing daughter Rachel MacNeill begged Pullan for the maximum sentence. 'He took the kindest, most caring person I've ever known, and he calculatingly took her from us all,' she said, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. The victim's sister, Linda Cuff, said painful questions lingered about Michele's final moments. The long-awaited sentence comes seven years after prosecutors say Martin MacNeill knocked out his wife with drugs prescribed following cosmetic surgery and left her to die in a bathtub so he could begin a new life with his mistress . 'I shatter thinking of my sister looking at her own husband as he was doing this to her,' she said. She then paused, and turned toward MacNeill. 'I can finally look into the eyes of my sister's murderer and say, 'Martin, you haven't gotten away with this,' she said. But when she looked into those eyes, she saw noting.

'I think it demonstrates a lack of respect for the process,' Grunander said. 'I think the defendant simply doesn't get it.' The case against Martin MacNeill shocked the Mormon community of Pleasant Grove, about 35 miles south of Salt Lake City. Martin . MacNeill has maintained his innocence.

"Thailand will install more surveillance cameras and better lighting in tourist areas following the murders of two British tourists last week. In an effort to prevent further attacks, major cities and resort islands have been instructed to improve security as a matter of urgency, a senior government official said. The deaths of Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, are still being investigated after their battered bodies were found on a Koh Tao beach last week. Tragedy: The new measures follow the murders of British tourists Hannah Witheridge and David Miller, who were found bludgeoned to death on a Koh Tao beach on September 15 . Deputy Prime Minister Gen. Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters he has ordered the Interior Ministry, Bangkok's city government and police to install the surveillance cameras and improve lighting. He said authorities are urgently investigating the case, which critics say has been bungled by police. 'The area where the incident happened was very dark. The closed-circuit cameras could not capture images. 'I have ordered authorities nationwide that there must be sufficient lighting, especially in Bangkok and major tourist cities. And there must be closed-circuit TV cameras all over the country,' Prawit said. 'I'm confident we will see clearer results within two months.' High security: Thailand will improve security by installing more surveillance cameras and better lighting tourist areas . None of the dozens of DNA samples taken from migrant workers, Thai men and foreigners has matched the crime scene evidence, and no arrests have been made since the bodies were found on Sairee beach on September 15. 'Right now we have limited the investigation to some areas and some individuals. We are not getting lost like they said because we have to work systematically,' said Prawit. The quiet, small island of Koh Tao is about 410 kilometers  south of Bangkok. It is a short boat ride from better-known Koh Samui and Koh Phangan, the latter known for raucous Full Moon parties that attract young travelers from Thailand and abroad.","Hannah Witheridge and David Miller found murdered in Koh Tao last week .

"He should have flushed: Ramon Herrara, 33, allegedly left a lot behind in the Albuquerque home he's accused of robbing last month, including a dirty toilet . A New Mexico burglar who broke into a vacationing family's home has been nabbed with the help of DNA he left behind after downing a can of Coke and then using the toilet and failing to flush. Ramon Herrera, 33, is accused of stealing $250,000 from a home in Albuquerque in September. Police combed the scene and found a can of Coca-Cola with a note that read 'Sorry.' By then the thief had fled the scene, but cops found what was left of his soda. According to the Albuquerque Journal, the homeowners found their sliding back door smashed when they arrived home. The homeowners also discovered footprints leading out to a field and a sweatshirt stashed behind a wall near the house. Police swabbed the can of Coke and also a flashlight that had been left behind. Lucky for them, investigators didn't need to swab the sullied toilet. '(The detective) failed to collect any samples from the used toilet,' says a court filing. What they did collect, authorities say led them to Ramon. He was booked on charges of residential burglary and larceny over $20,000. Herrera has since pleaded not guilty.","Ramon Herrera, 33, is accused of stealing $250,000 from an Albuquerque, New Mexico home in September ."
"She's the flame-haired make-up artist  credited with transforming the likes of Penelope Cruz, Millie Mackintosh and Cara Delevingne. Poppy Delevingne, 28, even called on her to do her bridal make-up for her wedding earlier this year. So it's fair to say that Charlotte Tilbury, who is Kate Moss' go-to make-up artist and best friend, knows a thing or two about beauty. It is perhaps then little surprise that A-lister Kim Kardashian, 33, known for her love of dazzling red carpet looks, called on the make-up maestro to give her a Brit girl makeover when she landed in London recently. Beauty buddies: Kim Kardashian enlisted the help of make-up artist to the stars, Charlotte Tilbury, during her time in London and was treated to a 'Dolce Vita' makeover . The pair met in London last week and Charlotte taught Kim all the tricks of her trade and treated her to her £165 'Dolce Vita' makeover. 'This look is for the woman who lives  a life of luxury, pleasure and indulgence,' says Charlotte. 'Underneath those full, flirtatious lashes is a super sultry stare. ""Come to bed eyes"" may as well have been a phrase invented for her. 'A seductive lashline flicks outwards and upwards in an alluring, smoky homage to the screen sirens and starlets past and present; Sophia Loren, Penelope Cruz, Monica Bellucci.' She prepped the TV star's skin with her famous magic cream, which she decided to mass produce after it became a hit with models backstage at fashion week, before using her Wonderglow beauty flash and Filmstar Bronze and Glow contour kit - a perfect product for the lady who put contouring on the map. Showcasing the look: Kim showed off Charlotte's work on a night out in east London. The look, which Charlotte describes as for the woman who lives a life of luxury, pleasure and indulgence, consists of bronzed eyes and a pink lip . She then powdered Kim's T-zone, curled her eyelashes to open her eyes, and created a bronzed, smokey eye with her shadows and a feline flick with kohl pencil. She applied 'lashings and lashings' of mascara before using her bronzing sculpt shade over Kim's cheekbones, temples and chin before taking the highlighter across the top of the cheekbones, down the middle of the nose and across the top of the mouth. She completed the star's look with a natural pink liner and lipstick and a swish of blush on the apple of her cheeks. In a tutorial on achieving the look on her website CharlotteTilbury.com Charlotte explains that the style is perfect for olive-skinned beauties like Kim, using smouldering copper and bronze shades on the 33-year-old, paired with a pink seductive lip. Speaking about working with the reality TV star, Charlotte said: 'I had the pleasure of working with the charming and absolutely beautiful Kim Kardashian - she has the most outrageously natural long lashes I've ever seen!'.

The soul singer was among the first to take part in 'The Watch' in central London this morning and will be joined by members of the public and the British Armed Forces throughout the day, until sunset. It was inspired by images of the repatriation of the Unknown Soldier in 1920, when guards kept a vigil at the coffin as a mark of respect.

Remembrance: David Cameron buys a poppy from members of the armed services at Downing Street today . As well as marking the launch of the Royal British Legion's (RBL) annual fundraising campaign, the watch also coincides with the centenary year of the outbreak of the First World War. Speaking at the start of her shift, Ms Stone, 27, said: 'There isn't one war that is more horrific than another. These men are incredibly brave and a lot of them have laid down their lives so that we can live in a peaceful environment. 'It's important for younger people to realise this because we haven't seen it (war). 'I'm a couple years off of 30 and I've never seen war. Hopefully, my children will never see war in our homes.

Mr Dunning, 29, from Wallasey in Merseyside, said: 'I'm honoured to be a part of this historic event. The RBL is the nation's custodian of remembrance and this is a great way for anyone, whether they have served or not, to remember a loved one and celebrate our armed forces. 'The support that the Legion has offered me since my accident has been great. They are helping me to live my life as best I can by making my day-to-day living easier."" Teenage cadet Kamil Cesarz, 18, from Ealing, west London, who stood at another corner of the memorial with Mr Dunning and pop star Stone, said: 'Being asked to take part in the watch is especially important to me. 'To be asked to represent 'the future' of the armed forces makes me extremely proud.'

Richard Carter was born just after the outbreak of the First World War and is celebrating his 100th birthday . A Poppy Appeal organiser, who was born only a few months after the outbreak of the First World War is celebrating his 100th birthday. It falls in the same week the Royal British Legion launched its appeal for the centenary year of the conflict. Richard Carter can still remember his half-brother returning home from the war which first introduced the poppy as a national symbol of remembrance. 'It was 1918, and my mother said there was someone at the door for me,' said Mr Carter. 'There was a man there in khaki with a teddy bear. He said he was my brother. He’d been in Gallipoli and was one of my three half-brothers who fought in the war. 'One of my other brothers had been killed on HMS Hampshire in the Orkneys.' During the Second World War, Mr Carter was an anti-aircraft gunner and served in Europe. After the war, he moved to Anglesey, Wales, having met his wife while stationed on the island during the conflict. Poppy seller Richard Carter cuts his cake alongside his daughter June and his great grandaughther Efa . He said: 'In those days, there was no electric, no gas and no rubbish collection, and we grew our own food. We rented a cottage for three shillings a week. The toilet was at the bottom of the garden.' But Mr Carter says wartime rationing played its part in getting him to his milestone birthday. 'The war years were the healthiest years we had in this country,' he said. 'The diet kept us all fit and healthy.' Mr Carter, a former printer, became involved with the Royal British Legion after his retirement at the age of 80. He said: 'I was at a loss for something to do, and thought I would do a bit of good for somebody else for a change. I’ve kept it going ever since.' Mr Carter used to ride around the local area on his bike to collect donations and now his daughter has now taken over some of the work on his behalf. He celebrated with his family and other local volunteers in Llanfairpwll, Anglesey, ahead of his 100th birthday on Sunday. Mr Carter, who has two daughters, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren, was also honoured for his 20 years of service with the Royal British Legion’s Poppy Appeal. 100-year-old Richard Carter receives a kiss from daughters June and Deliah ahead of his birthday on Sunday .","Joss Stone was first to take part in 'The Watch' in central London today .

"It’s a country that rejects the Western world but that hasn’t stopped North Korean authorities approving a colourful fashion show, complete with pale-faced models wiggling their hips in far from traditional clothing. Aram Pan, a photographer from Singapore, captured the bizarre display of brightly coloured frocks and suits - seemingly approved by dictator Kim Jong-un - while on his fourth trip to the communist enclave in September. He noted how hemlines are rising and the permitted hues are getting bolder inside the secretive state, upon his visit to the 12th Pyongyang Fashion Exhibition in North Korea’s capital. ‘The skirts overall do seem a wee bit shorter nowadays. There's also the occasional blouse with a lower neckline,’ Mr Pan said. Aram Pan captured smiling models on the odd-looking green runway in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang during his fourth visit to the country in September . A lime-coloured dress with black piping was on of the brightest suits on the runway and was seemingly approved by North Korean authorities . But what surprised him the most about the show was 'that the models all smile'. 'That's completely different to all the pouty stuff we're so used to seeing on our modern fashion runways,' he said. Mr Pan explained that the fashion show is an annual event which has been running for the past 12 years and the structured suits, which bear a passing resemblance to French fashion house Chanel’s designs, will soon go on sale in local shops. ‘It’s attended by local shop owners interested to place orders for new clothes. Every piece of the apparel on display has a number so they can identify the ones they want to order,’ Mr Pan told Daily Mail Australia. The event – likely to be the most glamorous two days on Pyongyang’s annual calendar - was held in an exhibition hall from 15 to 17 September. ‘Locals who aren’t shop owners are also able to attend the exhibition. There were easily over 1,000 people in the hall that day and it was packed,’ Mr Pan added. The women were wearing makeup and had their hair pinned back as they strutted their stuff in well fitted Chanel inspired suits . Numbers were pinned on their jackets so that local buyers could identify the clothes and choose which ones to stock in their shops . The photographer, who also visited North Korea’s only ski-resort – a pet project of leader Kim Jong-un’s – in September, said he noticed that Pyongyang citizens are ‘generally more stylish than their counterparts in other towns but that seems to be slowly changing’. ‘Now, fashion trends seem to be spreading out to the other towns and into rural areas,’ he said. The latest sartorial trends include ‘fancy umbrellas’. ‘I’ve been told they are now all the rage and ladies who own them will whip them out at any given chance’, Mr Pan said. Faux Burberry is also popular, as are red star earrings which make the perfect ‘socialist fashion accessory’, Mr Pan joked. Women also wear red pin badges on their lapels featuring the ‘supreme leader’s’ face. One model posed with a bizarre hand gesture in a white and brown suit featuring bow-detailing at the event which has been held annually for 12 years in the communist enclave's capital city . Traditional North Korean clothing was also on show at the event (seen in the background) but the western-style suits caught Aram Pan's eye, as he noted that women across the country now wear high-heels and shorter skirts . Monochrome suits appeared on the catwalk more than once and so did the colour red. Mr Pan said he did not find out where the models on the runway were from . Lots of the suits being modelled followed the monochrome trend but red, pink and a bright yellow colour were also incorporated into the chic designs. 'Based on my earlier perceptions of North Korean dressing, I must say that there are a whole lot of options for women to choose from today,' Mr Pan said. 'I think it is quite liberating for them.' Mr Pan said reports that trousers had been banned for women are not true. The photographer observed that the hemlines are rising  inside the secretive state, upon his visit to the 12th Pyongyang Fashion Exhibition . Thousands of local women and shop owners reportedly turned out to inspect the new designs that were on show . The women felt the material and observed many suits inside the exhibition hall. Despite previous reports Mr Pan said trousers have not been banned inside the country, it's just that many women chose to wear skirts . 'I have dozens of photos of women wearing pants in every area of North Korea. From the farmlands to the city, women are wearing pants everywhere. And I've shot these since my first trip in August 2013,' he reasoned. In the photos, there are numbers pinned onto the models' clothes so that buyers can identify the items they are interested in but the women themselves are not named. 'It didn't occur to me back then to ask the North Koreans where they were from,' Mr Pan said. Mr Pan, a commercial photographer by day who specialises in 360 degree panoramic virtual tours for real estate, hotels and automobiles, has now been on four visits to North Korea. More information on Aram Pan's North Korea 360 photography and video project can be found on his Facebook page and website.

"The Seven Network has been forced to abandon plans to 'simulate a car explosion' in the same Sydney suburb where a deadly blast killed three people earlier this month. Seven was branded 'insensitive and offensive' by former Leichhardt mayor Darcy Byrne over the planned blast in Rozelle, in Sydney's inner west, which was to be filmed just streets away from the recent disaster as part of a Rebecca Gibney crime drama. Bianka O'Brien, 31, her baby boy Jude and neighbour Chris Noble, 27, died on September 4 when a massive explosion occurred at a Rozelle convenience store below their homes on Darling St, the suburb's main thoroughfare, in the early hours of the morning. Seven's simulated blast was due to occur between 1pm and 5:45pm on Friday but following the uproar a spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the scene had been 'reworked'. All smiles: Gibney appeared upbeat as filming commenced in Rozelle - without the planned car explosion. Rebecca Gibney, the star of forthcoming drama The Killing Field, pictured on set in Rozelle. A modified car, believed to be the one which was supposed to explode, appears on the set of The Killing Field in Rozelle. The scene of the convenience store explosion in Rozelle. Mr Byrne said: 'Common sense would dictate that an explosion in Balmain or Rozelle at this time is insensitive and offensive. 'Whoever has approved this to take place should think have thought through more carefully the emotional impact of the people in Rozelle'. Mr Byrne said the recent explosion had taken a heavy toll on the suburb. 'The buildings were flattened, our economy has been severely damaged but its the human cost of this tragedy that has hit people so hard.' Firefighters planned to be present at the scene of the blast, according to emails seen by Daily Mail Australia.

The O'Briens and Mr Noble were asleep in their apartments when the explosion that killed them occurred earlier this month. Adeel Khan, 44, who ran the convenience store below the apartments where the explosion occurred, has been charged over their deaths.

"Police in northwest Indiana say they may have just caught a prolific serial killer who murdered at least four women across Chicagoland. A 43-year-old Gary man confessed to killing a woman whose body was found in a Motel 6. He told investigators where the bodies of three more women could be found. Cops found the three bodies at different locations in Gary late Saturday and early Sunday, following up on information the 43-year-old man provided during questioning, Hammond police Lieutenant Rich Hoyda said. The badly-decomposed bodies were found inside three abandoned homes. Victim Afrika Hardy, 19, was found at this Motel 6 in Hammond, Indiana . Anith Jones, 35, was identified by relatives as one of the victims. It is unclear how she met the killer . The man, who has not been identified pending charges, may have killed many more victims over several years, WGN reported. His latest victim — 19-year-old Afrika Hardy, who was strangled — may have been prostitute he met on the Craigslist-like website Backpage.com, according to the station. He is reported to have acted alone in killing 'many others' in Indiana and Illinois, according to WGN. The Lake County coroner's office said second victim had been identified by family members as 35-year-old Anith Jones of Merrillville. Cops were led to the bodies of two other women. Autopsies had not yet been completed on her or the other two women, who have not yet been identified. The Post-Tribune of Merrillville reported Jones had been missing since Oct. 8 and Gary police had searched a block recently looking for her. Police discovered Hardy's body about 9:30pm Friday at a Motel 6. 'A friend of the deceased called us and she was concerned when she didn't respond to her calling,' Hoyda said. 'We were sent there and found that person dead.' Police investigating her death obtained a search warrant for a home and vehicle in Gary. Police conducted a search late Saturday afternoon and took the man into custody. Hoyda said the man confessed during questioning and then told police 'where several other female victims of possible homicide were located.' Hoyda wouldn't comment on how the man knew the women, on a possible motive or on whether the man confessed to killing any of the other three women. Gary police Cpl.

"A multimillionaire pharmaceuticals entrepreneur has been convicted of manslaughter for fatally poisoning her eight-year-old autistic son in their luxury Manhattan hotel room four years ago. Gigi Jordan, 53, avoided a murder conviction on Wednesday, meaning that she could serve as little as five years behind bars for killing her son, Jude Mirra, in February 2010. The maximum sentence she faces is 25 years in prison. Following the six-week trial, jurors accepted her  defense that she had given her son a fatal dose of prescription drugs while in a state of 'extreme emotional 'disturbance', the New York Post reported. She said she had feared that her ex-husband was going to kill her, leaving Jude in the custody of his biological father, who had sexually abused him. The boy's father has denied the claim. Scroll down for video . Verdict: Gigi Jordan, in court in August 2011, has been convicted of manslaughter for killing her son in 2010. She said she took his life because she feared he would be left in the custody of his 'abusive' father . Killed: Jordan is pictured with her son Jude Mirra, whom she fatally poisoned in a hotel room in 2010 . If she had been found guilty of murder, she would have faced 15 years to life behind bars. Jordan was found lying among 5,819 pills and an empty bottle of Grey Goose vodka near her son’s corpse in the $2,300-a-night suite at the Peninsula Hotel on Fifth Avenue on February 5, 2010. She told authorities she had given her son pills before the unsuccessful attempt to take her own life. It also emerged that, as her son lay dying, she had calmly requested a bottle of water from the hotel, extended her stay and transferred $125,000 of money to another account. Jude, who was non-verbal, was initially deemed autistic but later was diagnosed with immune-system abnormalities, post-traumatic stress disorder and other problems, Jordan has said. Prosecutors had claimed that she killed her son after realizing he would not get better. Denial: In an interview with Dr Phil last week (pictured), Jordan said she killed her son because she felt 'incapable of protecting him'. She has said she feared her ex-husband was going to kill her . Tragic: The socialite is pictured with Jude when he was a toddler. The eight-year-old boy, who had  immune-system abnormalities and post-traumatic stress disorder, was non-verbal . But Johnson has said that she set out to take her life and her son's for a complex set of reasons. She claimed  that her ex-husband and former business partner, Ray Mirra, wanted to kill her after she found out that he had stolen millions from her. That would leave her son in the custody of his biological father, Emil Tzekov, whom she said had sexually abused him. Both men have denied her allegations. Neither has been charged with any crime. Prosecutors pointed out that both men had signed away their parental rights, meaning that they would never get custody of the boy, even if she did die. Various authorities rebuffed her requests to investigate the abuse allegation, she said. One of her inquiries instead ended with her hospitalized for a psychological examination in 2008, but she was released within days. Even though the second grader was unable to speak, Jordan has claimed it was actually her son who suggested they took their lives - by typing messages on her phone. Killed: Jude, right, was found dead inside the ill-strewn room at the Peninsula hotel in Manhattan in 2010 . Tragic: A gurney carrying Jude's body is wheeled to van outside the Peninsula Hotel on February 5, 2010 . She claims he  urged her to use 'a lot of drugs' so he would die peacefully. 'I wish you do it soon,' she claims he wrote. 'I'm scare u r too chicken.' Last week, as she awaited the verdict, Jordan spoke to Dr. Phil in an exclusive interview from Rikers Island, New York and said that she saw no option but to kill her son. 'To run would only make me more vulnerable,' she said. 'I felt completely incapable of protecting him. Whether that was rational or not, I can't say, but I don't think I'm a cold blooded murderer.' Dr Phil asked: 'Who gave you the right to end this child's life?' 'I wanted him to be safe,' she responded. 'I didn't want him to be tortured anymore.' And when asked if she has any regrets and she said simply: 'I would have done a better job of ending my own life.'","Gigi Jordan killed her son, Jude Mirra, with a lethal cocktail of prescription drugs and vodka in their luxury Manhattan hotel room in February 2010 .

"Police were last night investigating a complaint by the son of an elderly woman who died in hospital after her food and fluids were allegedly withdrawn without his agreement. Peter Tulloch says his 83-year-old mother Jean had her intravenous drip removed even though she was ‘far from being dead’. He claims she died after being placed on the Liverpool Care Pathway – a controversial NHS process used across the country under which the dying are helped in their final hours. Shocked: Peter Tulloch, 55, of Bedfordshire, says he visited his mother Jean, 83, (pictured aged 45 in 1973) in hospital to find that she had been isolated and that the intravenous drip had been removed . Mr Tulloch said that there was . ‘overwhelming evidence of wrongdoing’ by doctors in his mother’s case. He wants police to consider whether this ‘extremely cruel’ treatment . amounted to attempted murder. The case has led to a fresh wave of . concern over the use of the Pathway. The older people’s group Saga . branded it the ‘lack of care pathway’ while a campaign group suggested . that in some cases its use amounted to euthanasia. Mr Tulloch, 55, a London Underground . engineer, went to police after his mother was deprived of food and fluid . for 30 hours while in Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. She had . been referred to the hospital from her care home with a urinary tract . infection. When he arrived at the hospital on . March 14, he found that his mother, although weak, was ‘far from being . dead’. She was conscious and smiling. Doctors advised her family to return to their homes and said they would be notified if her condition worsened. Location: Mr Tulloch has made a formal complaint to the NHS that doctors at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh (pictured) used the LCP to try to hasten his mother's death deliberately . But when Mr Tulloch visited the next . day he found Mrs Tulloch’s food and fluid tubes had been removed. He . said medical notes showed she had been placed on the Pathway. ‘The effect on me was equivalent to . walking into an intensive care unit to discover a patient has been . disconnected from their life support machine and the machine removed,’ he said . ‘I did not notice any change in my . mother’s condition from the previous day and was alarmed that she was . cut off from any means of sustenance.’ Mrs Tulloch was removed from the Pathway after 30 hours but died two weeks later. Her son, who lives in Biggleswade, . Bedfordshire, said: ‘To deprive my mother, conscious and aware of my . presence, of all means of sustenance appeared to me to be extremely . cruel. I had the impression that it had been decided to hasten her . demise. I believe that the evidence of wrongdoing against my mother is . overwhelming.’ THE Liverpool Care Pathway was . developed in the North West during the 1990s with the aim of increasing . the comfort of the dying and sparing those in their last hours of life . from pain and the trauma of useless and invasive treatment. First used at the Marie Curie . Hospice in Liverpool, it has spread widely through the NHS following the . decision to recommend it to hospitals by the National Institute for . Health and Clinical Excellence in 2004. The Pathway is designed to come into . operation when doctors believe it is impossible for a patient to . recover and death is imminent. Last summer Professor Patrick . Pullicino, a consultant neurologist, said that 29 per cent of NHS deaths . now involve the Pathway, a figure which suggests around 130,000 a year. On average, a patient dies 33 hours after entering the Pathway, he . said. Once patients are in the system, . treatment aimed at their recovery is withdrawn, and instead medical . efforts are concentrated on trying to increase comfort and ease pain. Among the causes of controversy is . the perception that patients on the Pathway are routinely sedated with . drugs and deprived of food and fluids by tube, which critics say is . cruel and likely to cause death rapidly. There have also been claims . that it is used to free up beds. Artificial nutrition and hydration . has been considered treatment in legal terms since a landmark House of . Lords court decision in 1993. Defenders of the system say it spares patients suffering and pain. Last month a ‘consensus statement’ in support of the Pathway by medical colleges and charities said no . patient should be consigned to the Pathway without the involvement of at . least two doctors. Carers and families should always be involved in . decisions about patients’ care. A spokesman for NHS Lothian said it . did not discuss individual cases. Bedfordshire police confirmed that Mr . Tulloch has made a complaint. Last summer a hospital consultant said the . Liverpool Care Pathway had become an assisted death pathway, killing . more than 100,000 patients a year, and that it was being used to free . beds in wards and get rid of difficult patients. Professor Patrick . Pullicino, a consultant neurologist for East Kent Hospitals and . Professor of Clinical Neurosciences at Kent University, told a . conference that it is not scientifically possible to predict if a . patient will die within days. Yesterday, after details of the Tulloch . case emerged, campaigners spoke of their fears about the Pathway. Elspeth Chowdharay-Best, spokesman for . the Alert anti-euthanasia pressure group, said: ‘We have heard from a . large number of people who have lost relatives. People don’t forget. ‘We believe this is euthanasia. There . is growing evidence that one factor involved is that using the Liverpool . Care Pathway saves hospitals money.’ Dr Ros Altmann, director of the Saga . organisation which provides care at home to thousands of frail and . vulnerable elderly people, said: ‘It would be more appropriate to call . it the Liverpool lack of care pathway. ‘The families involved are usually in . no position to speak for themselves. It is really important that their . families are properly informed throughout the process. ‘This is such a serious issue and it . is likely to affect so many people that medical staff must surely want . to keep families informed, if only to prevent incidents like the Tulloch . case.’ Dr Altmann added: ‘There may be very good reasons for putting a . patient on the Pathway, but that is not to excuse doing it without . explaining that to their loved ones. The families cannot understand what . is happening and have to suffer the consequences.’ Last summer, Health Minister Earl Howe . told peers that ‘some people who have been on the Liverpool Care . Pathway have received poor care’, adding that ‘the Pathway is not of . itself a guarantor of best-quality care’. Instead, the decision to put a patient on the Pathway has become ‘a self-fulfilling prophecy’. Commenting after Professor Pullicino . made his comments, a Department of Health spokesman said: ‘The Liverpool . Care Pathway is not euthanasia and we do not recognise these figures. The Pathway is recommended by the National Institute for Health and . Clinical Excellence and has overwhelming support from clinicians – at . home and abroad – including the Royal College of Physicians. ‘A patient’s condition is monitored at . least every four hours and, if a patient improves, they are taken off . the Liverpool Care Pathway and given whatever treatments best suit their . new needs.’","Peter Tulloch, 55, of Bedfordshire, had visited his mother Jean in .

"Health tourists must be given free treatment by GPs because it is their human right, say NHS bosses. New guidelines tell doctors across England they must register any foreign patient who asks for care otherwise it would be ‘discriminatory’. These include asylum seekers, overseas students or tourists coming for a short holiday. Once registered, they will be entitled to the same NHS care as all other patients and can receive free blood tests, jabs and – in some cases – free prescription drugs. Must treat: New guidelines tell doctors across England they must register any foreign patient who asks for care otherwise it would be 'discriminatory' In fact, the new rules will give overseas patients more rights than those living in the UK who can be turned away from surgeries if they live a few yards outside its catchment area. There are also fears the ruling will make it even harder for local patients to get an appointment. Free: Once registered, health tourists will be entitled to the same NHS care as other patients including free blood tests and jabs . Already half of patients cannot get an . appointment with their doctor within 48 hours, according to the . Government’s own figures. Some family doctors are furious at the guidelines and describe them as a ‘charter for health tourism’. They say that such patients, once . registered at a surgery, will also find it far easier to be referred to . hospital for thousands of pounds of free treatment. By law, overseas patients are not entitled to be treated at hospital – unless it is urgent – but staff rarely check on their backgrounds. Until now, GP practices were not  legally obliged to register foreigners  and many turn away patients if they do not have passports or ‘proof of address’ documents. But the new guidelines issued to all doctors in England will change this. One GP, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘I am not sure the British taxpayer should be paying for the world’s health treatment for free.’ And Tory MP Chris Skidmore, who is campaigning for tougher regulation on health tourism, said: ‘It is alarming that managers are passing these kind of diktats to doctors, many of whom are rightly  worried that GP registration is effectively buying free treatment on the NHS. ‘This is not just about the money, vital though that is – we cannot have the NHS, paid for by taxpayers, being abused by people who pay nothing into the system and who are not eligible for free care.’ Mr Skidmore has obtained figures showing that health tourists currently owe the NHS £40million in unpaid medical bills. Health tourists: Asylum seekers, overseas students or tourists (pictured) coming for a short holiday are eligible for treatment under the new rules which give overseas patients more rights than those living in the UK . In the last year nearly 3,600 ‘overseas visitors’ have had hospital treatment worth at least £1,000 a time. National guidelines say it would be discriminatory for GPs not to treat health tourists. NHS London, one of four strategic health authorities in England, has backed up this advice with further guidelines explaining they will ‘promote human rights and public health’. Local fears: There is concern that the ruling will make it even harder for local patients to get an appointment. Already half of patients cannot get an appointment with their doctor within 48 hours . Dr Vijayakar Abrol, a GP who practises . in Edgbaston, Birmingham, said: ‘The guidance is not worth the paper it . is written on. We do not have endless resources. Why should we give . these patients – be they from India, Canada, the US or Eastern Europe – . free treatment? 'Alarming': Tory MP Chris Skidmore is campaigning for tougher regulation on health tourism . ‘We cannot go to those countries and get free treatment ourselves.’ Last week an investigation by BBC’s . Panorama found that staff working at GP surgeries were taking bribes of . £800 to register health tourists on surgery lists. One manager, Asif Butt, who worked at a practice in Sparkhill, Birmingham, has since been suspended. Some doctors say it is cost-effective – not to mention humane – to register overseas patients. Dr Vivienne Nathanson, head of science and ethics at the British Medical Association, said it would be far cheaper to give patients insulin for diabetes, for example, rather than later treating them in A&E after they had fallen into a coma. They also believe it could help prevent the spread of certain diseases such as tuberculosis which is commonly brought in by overseas patients.","Foreigners must be given free treatment by GPs - it is their human right .

"Kyle Richards, 45, reveals she has suffered dry eye syndrome for five years . Fans of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills will know it’s an emotional show. Viewers have seen tears of anger, sadness and joy across the last four seasons. But for one cast member, tears weren’t a problem - but a lack of them. Kyle Richards has revealed she has been suffering with chronic dry eye syndrome for the past five years, which made her constantly uncomfortable and made filming difficult. Five years ago she began noticing her eyes were painful and she needed to use eye drops that helped her eyes stay temporarily moist. Her condition became so bad she had to use eye drops every five minutes. She told MailOnline: ‘I first started noticing about five years ago. It was so uncomfortable I couldn’t see. 'My eyes would be blurry unless I blinked. They bothered me all the time’ she said, . ‘I was using false tears [eye drops] every five minutes. 'I kept thinking I was dehydrated, I put water in my eyes - but that made it worse. It was just so uncomfortable.' She says not knowing what was wrong made the situation even more infuriating. 'I would say to my girlfriends ""Do you have this?"" ‘When I was shooting I’d have to use false tears all the time then my mascara would run’. It made me irritable.’ Eight months ago she went to the doctor who diagnosed her with dry eye syndrome, or dry eye disease. This is a common condition that occurs when the eyes dry out and become inflamed, red and swollen. It happens when the eyes don't make enough tears or the tears evaporate too quickly. Kyle lives in LA, which is hot and windy, and wears contact lenses – two known causes of the condition. It can also be caused by other eye diseases or underlying conditions, side effects to certain medications and by hormonal changes, such as during the menopause. Kyle said before was diagnosed, she wasn’t aware the condition existed - and then became concerned it was a sign of ageing. ‘I thought ""Am I too young to be getting this? Does it mean I’m getting older?"" Before she was diagnosed, Ms Richards had no idea the condition existed, and kept asking her girlfriends 'Do you have this?' Kyle and husband Mauricio Umansky  in Beverly Hills. The star says dry eye syndrome left her constantly uncomfortable and irritable . Before she was diagnosed, Kyle had to use eye drops every five minutes to moisten her eyes . 'But I’ve learned from my doctor that it affects people of all ages. People don’t realise it’s a diagnosed condition.' As the fifth series of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills is about to come out, news reports reveal the 45-year-old is in great shape - despite having four children. She says she maintains her enviably trim physique through a no-sugar diet. ‘It’s about a healthy lifestyle,' she told MailOnline. 'I avoid sugar, carbs, dairy. I’m always trying to be a healthy as I can be. I’m constantly learning more about nutrition.’ And when she commits to a diet she sticks to it, she added. ‘There are times in my life when I fell off and then you don’t see any results. It makes such a difference by sticking to it. There has been a lot of crying in the past four seasons of the show, but Ms Richards says the fifth season about to air is 'the best season ever' Kyle lives in LA, which is hot and windy, and wears contact lenses – two known causes of the eye condition . 'My husband and my kids notice. It used to be about looking good, but now it’s about feeling healthy and living a long time. ‘It used to be about looking cute in that dress, now it’s about being here a long time. ‘You start realising you’re fragile.’ She is equally disciplined when it comes to exercise, never skipping a workout she has planned in favour of watching some reality TV. ‘Spinning, circuit training and hiking and I take off one day a week. I tell myself it’s not an option. I just make myself. It’s easy to slack off. I keep going. I never cancel a workout.’ When asked whether surgery is something she would recommend for her own daughters, she said although she did not regret going under the knife, it’s not something she’d recommend for her own children. Dry eye syndrome, or dry eye disease, is a common condition that occurs when the eyes do not make enough tears or the tears evaporate too quickly. This leads to the eyes drying out and becoming inflamed (red and swollen) and irritated. Dry eye syndrome is also known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or simply 'dry eyes'. The symptoms of dry eye syndrome usually affect both eyes and often include: . -feelings of dryness, grittiness or soreness that get worse throughout the day . -red eyes . -eyelids that stick together when you wake up . -temporarily blurred vision, which usually improves when you blink . Source: NHS Choices . ‘I’m not pro-surgery but I’m honest and open about what I’ve done. 'If my daughters wanted it I would be against it. I would be dead against it. To me, they are perfect.’ Speaking of the new season of the show, she said rumours that she gets into a fight with fellow housewife Brandi Glanville at a cast party are ‘inaccurate’. She is diplomatic, avoiding questions about allegations the two new members of the show, Lisa Rinna and Eileen Davidson, are already   creating drama. ‘It’s a very intense season,' she said. 'It’s going to be the best season ever. I’m not allowed to say a lot about, but it’s been very interesting to say the least.' But despite her new fitness regime, she has openly admitted that she has had both a nose job and liposuction in the past, in order to improve her self-esteem. Kyle was prescribed Restasis, a prescription drug which helps the body produce more tears. ‘After using it daily for six months, I noticed I was making more of my own tears.' ‘You take twice a day, once in the night once in the morning. I make it part of my routine.’ 'Now my eyes are comfortable, I might have to use artificial tears in air conditioned room, but apart from that I can throw them away.’ A diet that includes omega-3 fats can help with dry eyes. Kyle said she included these in her diet, but the pills didn’t make much of a difference. ‘I took vitamins before anyway but it didn’t work’ she added. Serious cases of the condition can be treated with surgery to prevent tears from draining away easily, but Kyle said this was not an option for her.

"Their wealth, fame and power puts them head and shoulders above us mere mortals. But according to these celebrities, true happiness lies in some of life’s simpler pleasures. More than 100 musicians, politicians and sports stars have shared the secret of what makes them happy for a new book in aid of the BBC’s Children in Need appeal. Scroll down for video . The Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson, 55, has revealed in a new charity book that what most sets her spirits soaring is a belief in magic and fairies . Perhaps predictably, both David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nigel Farage all made the vote-winning claim that their families are the key to their wellbeing. But others gave unexpected snapshots into their celebrity lives. Bizarrely, the Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson, 55, revealed that what most sets her spirits soaring is a belief in magic and fairies. She said: ‘I do believe in fairies. I do believe in magic and when you blow on a dandelion, you will see the light of the enchanted spreading their wings and disappearing off on their own journeys, just like you have today when you opened your eyes. Don’t let the day go by without looking for fairies and magic. Happy: Both David Cameron and Nigel Farage said that their families are the key to their wellbeing . Family: Former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney, 72, revealed that he gets his pleasure through his stomach as well as his family, including his daughter Stella (right) and her children . ‘That makes me happy, as every day is, therefore, a day of exploration and adventure.’ Meanwhile, former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney, 72, revealed that he gets his pleasure through his stomach as well as his family. He said: ‘I love to hear the noises in the kitchen as the meal is prepared and then my little grandson climbs on my knee and requests a bite for every bite that I take.’ Tennis champion Andy Murray, 27, said he badly misses his Border Terriers Rusty and Maggie May (pictured) when he is playing in tournaments . Food was also key to Strictly Come Dancing judge Len Goodman, 70, who said ‘eating a bacon sandwich’ was enough to put a smile on his face, while rocker Rod Stewart, claimed that a simple cup of tea made him ‘uncontrollably happy.’ For our most gifted sports stars, however, it seems the key to the good life is a faithful hound. Tennis champion Andy Murray, 27, said he badly misses his Border Terriers Rusty and Maggie May when he is playing in tournaments around the world, adding: ‘They don’t care whether I win or lose. They make me smile every day I spend with them.’ Former England striker Gary Lineker, 53, agreed, saying: ‘Walking my dog makes me happy. His utter joy at the word “walkies” never diminishes. Such enthusiasm for something so simple is strangely satisfying.’ Other celebrities who took joy from their pets were actress Imelda Staunton, 58, who said she likes to take her dog on early morning walks in the park, and musical impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber, 66, who listed his Turkish Van cats among his greatest pleasures. The book, entitled What makes Me Happy?, was compiled by schoolgirl Hanni Blaskey, 13, from Hampstead, north London. She said she had the idea two years ago while watching a Children in Need documentary about a young girl who had to care for her bedbound mother. She wrote to hundreds of famous people, waited outside music studios and even followed celebrities through airports to get their thoughts on happiness. So far her book has raised £30,000 for the charity appeal. She said: ‘I just wondered aloud what would make her happy. I thought I’d ask famous people because everyone identifies with them. It was an amazing response.’ What Makes Me Happy? is available to buy at Sainsbury’s for £3. For every copy sold, £2 will donated to BBC Children in Need. Prime Minister David Cameron . ‘On a personal level, my own happiness index is very easy to explain: it is all about my family. Whether it is the everyday routines I go through with Samantha and the children; taking my youngest daughter Florence to nursery; helping Nancy complete her homework; or watching Elwen play football and rugby, I am happiest when I am with those I love the most and enjoying quality time with them.’ Labour Leader Ed Miliband . ‘My family is the most important thing in the world to me so spending time with my wife Justine and my boys Daniel and Sam is what always makes me happy.’ UKIP leader Nigel Farage . ‘Being with my four healthy children and thinking about how lucky we all are compared to many. This is a time to think about others less fortunate than ourselves.’ Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps . ‘The rare occasion when I check my diary and there’s nothing in it for the next hour.’ London mayor Boris Johnson . ‘Sitting in the sun and trying to paint the view, or possibly, a person.’ Comedian Michael McIntyre . ‘Children in the morning when they haven’t woken up to misbehave’ BBC presenter Gaby Roslin . ‘My kids, my husband and a hot bath’. Ex-England striker Gary Lineker . ‘Walking my dog makes me happy. His utter joy at the word “walkies” never diminishes. Such enthusiasm for something so simple is strangely satisfying.’ Actress Imelda Staunton . ‘Walking very early in the mornings during the summer with my little dog – either on the Heath or by the sea…heaven.’ Strictly Come Dancing judge Len Goodman . ‘Eating a bacon sandwich. Sleeping in the chair. Being nice on Strictly. Getting out of bed and nothing falls off.’ TV presenter Richard Madeley . ‘Being up early enough to see the sun rise over Talland Bay in Cornwall. Nearest thing to paradise on earth.’ The Duchess of York . ‘Your eyes open and the life is a fresh, new day, the sunlight nudges through the curtains. I do believe in fairies. I do believe in magic and when you blow on a dandelion, you will see the light of the enchanted spreading their wings and disappearing off on their own journeys, just like you have today when you opened your eyes.

"A man has died in a tragic surfing accident off the coast of Western Australia after he was injured by a surfboard. The 51-year-old was at Surfer's Point in Prevelly near the Margaret River when either the nose or fin of his board is said to have damaged the main artery in one of his legs causing massive blood loss. The father-of-two was dragged ashore by fellow surfers The Daily Telegraph reported, and others on the beach performed CPR on the man for nearly half an hour. A 51-year-old man has died at popular break Surfer's Point in Prevelly near the Margaret River in WA . From NSW, the surfer was on holidays in WA with his father, wife, and children, and one witness said the man's elderly father was watching on from the carpark when the grisly scene unfolded. 'You just wouldn't believe it because the swell was 2m, the winds were only light, and Surfers Point is always powerful but it wasn't as powerful as it gets,' Darrly Naidu told The Daily Telegraph, speaking of the horrible circumstances in which the man died. He also told of how two men brought the 51-year-old to shore after they saw him wipe-out, and found him with blood pooling around him in the water. The surfer - from NSW but holidaying in WA - was transported to hospital but died shortly after . Another witness who spoke to the website said the man was losing a lot of blood from what could have been his femoral artery - which is the main supply of blood to the lower half of the body. St Johns Ambulance paramedics arrived at the scene just after 11am, after reports the man had been injured. The 51-year-old was rushed to Margaret River Hospital by emergency services according to the ABC, but died a short time later. West Australian Police media told Daily Mail Australia a report is being prepared for the coroner.","The man died at Surfer's Point in Prevelly near the Margaret River in WA .

"Authorities say 13 teenagers escaped overnight from a youth detention center in Nashville, but all but one were recaptured within hours. Timothy B. Willis, a 16-year-old with a record including charges for theft, assault, and being a runaway, is still at large. The Tennessee Department of Children's Services says in a statement that thirteen teens overpowered a guard late Friday, taking his keys to open a door at the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center. Timothy B. Willis, a 16-year-old with a record including charges for theft, assault, and being a runaway, is the only teen still at large after a mass escape attempt at a youth detention center in Nashville . According to the Tennessean, one managed to squeeze out through an opening between the rolling gate and perimeter fence. That boy was able to throw a rock through the guard house window on the opposite side, then open the gate and let the rest free. The statement says police located all but Willis within hours. The 12 youth back in custody were taken to a juvenile court detention center. The breach was the third major disturbance reported in recent weeks at the center. In that case, the teens escaped by kicking through the dorm walls and shimmying underneath a weak spot in the perimeter fence. Two juveniles from a Sept. 1 escape remain at large. Several of those who participated in this most recent attempt were also part of previous escapes. Repeat offenders may be transferred to a new facility. The state department of corrections may also transfer extra guards to the facility. The facility generally houses teens with at least three felonies on their records, spokesman Rob Johnson told the Tennessean. The Tennessee Department of Children's Services says in a statement that thirteen teens overpowered a guard late Friday, taking his keys to open a door at the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center . Officials say the boys tried to convince the facility's 52 other inmates to follow them out. 'We believe the students tried to get other youth to join in, but they refused,' a statement from authorities said. Two of the 14 staff members working during the escape sustained minor injuries. 'Aside from calling for help on a radio, the guards have few methods to control the youth,' the statement read. 'They do not have weapons or pepper spray.' Children's Services officials and police didn't immediately answer Associated Press calls for details Saturday. The department said 52 other teens at Woodland Hills remained securely held. Authorities are asking that anyone with information on the whereabouts of Willis call 862-8600.","Timothy B.

"While it enjoys a rise in earnings and customers, Irish budget airline Ryanair has been ordered to repay nearly £400,000 in illegal subsidies that it received from a German airport. EU regulators ruled this week that marketing and airport service deals provided by Zweibrucken Airport to the Dublin-based carrier and other discount airlines were in breach of state aid rules. The European Commission found that the deal between Ryanair and the airport near German's border with France was illegal because it provided Europe’s largest budget carrier with an unfair advantage over its competitors. Legal battle: Ryanair insists its agreements are not illegal and it will appeal the Zweibrucken Airport ruling . Ryanair stopped flying to and from Zweibrucken in 2009 after carrying 50,000 passengers. While it was dealt a blow with the Zweibrucken Airport ruling, Ryanair scored a victory with the commission’s ruling that its agreements with Charleroi Airport in Belgium, Frankfurt Hahn in Germany, Alghero in Italy and Vasteras in Sweden did not violate state aid rules. The Charleroi ruling dates back to a complaint that was filed by competitor Brussels Airport in 2001 and upheld by the commission in 2004. Ryanair won its appeal in the European Court of Justice in 2008. Ryanair said in a statement that it welcomes the rulings that were in its favour and will appeal the Zweibrucken decision, insisting that all of its airport arrangements comply with EU state aid rules. Ryanair was cleared after investigations into its deals with four other European airports . The controversial carrier is currently in the middle of a charm offensive to win over customers and improve its public image. Regulators ruled on a number of complaints involving deals granted by regional authorities to attract budget airlines to secondary European airports. The deals have fuelled the explosive growth of low-cost carriers and their success in competing with larger airlines. Budget airline Germanwings has been ordered to repay almost £1m in subsidies from Zweibrucken Airport . Zweibrucken Airport, which is in insolvency proceedings and searching for an investor, has been ordered to repay around £36m in investment and operating aid to German authorities. In other rulings, regulators ordered Zweibrucken Airport to recover £940,000 from Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings and £156,000 from fellow German budget carrier TUIfly. The European Commission also warned Belgium that it may be giving unauthorised subsidies to Brussels Airlines.","European Commission delivered rulings in several lengthy investigations .

"Tarik Hassane is among five young men arrested on suspicion of terror offences . A Muslim medical student arrested during terror raids in London complained that incest and homosexuality in the UK was rife before being taken in by police, it has been reported. Tarik Hassane, 20, was among four young men arrested by Metropolitan Police this week as part of an ongoing investigation into terrorist offences. The group is thought to have been orchestrating the first UK-based Islamic extremist attack since the spread of ISIS. The medical student, who was studying in Sudan before returning to London this summer, shared his views on Islam on Twitter and by answering young Muslims' questions on an ask.fm page. On one occasion, he is believed to have said that jihadist fighters in Syria were 'fulfilling the greatest deed in Islam,' the Sunday Times reports. But in a separate response, he told followers he was 'not with ISIS'. 'I don't know about ISIS, I'm not with them and know barely anything about them.' Later he reveals he will not be waging jihad anytime soon and wants to make his parents 'happy'. Hassane is one of five friends arrested in west London last week as part of an ongoing investigation into terrorist offences. Yasir Mahmoud, Rawan Kheder, Gusai Abuzeid and a fifth man who cannot be named for legal reasons, were also taken into custody. The 20-year-old, who claims to be half Moroccan and half Saudi, was arrested following a tweet sent to his friends which read 'Oi lads... I smell war'. Police raided the flat Hassane lives in in London this week alongside those of his friends as part of an ongoing investigation into terrorism . The men all grew up in London with some thought to have attended Westminster City School. Hassane (left top) is pictured with fellow suspect Gusai Abuzeid (left). Rawan Kheder is pictured, right . It was claimed he had recently been in Syria and returned to the UK, though friends dispute the post was related to a suspected terrorist plot, insisting he is not a violent person. Following the men's arrest, Metropolitan Police were granted a warrant for further detention until October 14. All are thought to have attended Westminster City School for Boys and are UK nationals. Hassane's arrest sparked controversy online with thousands of Twitter users citing a #JusticeforTarik hashtag when he was detained. They claimed he was sharing a joke with friends when he wrote the post and not referring to ongoing tensions between extremist Muslims and the West.","Tarik Hassane reportedly made the comments online before arrest .

If his cover had been blown, Sarwar - who has not military experience and who went in with no back up or escape plan - believes he would have been immediately murdered or taken hostage. But he earned their trust and returned alive after an experience that was, he said, 'terrifying' in an environment that 'glamorised and normalised violence'. After returning to Britain Sarwar has reported his experience to police and he has debriefed counter-terrorism officers with a description of what he encountered. Speaking for the first time about his extraordinary mission he said: 'Since 9/11, I became increasingly concerned about the threat of terrorism and, more specifically, about the risk of my own family - and other innocent British youngsters - being brainwashed by these extremists through clever internet marketing. 'Having harboured this fear for many years, my chance came to do something about it when I travelled to Pakistan on an aid mission. 'I knew that this was my best chance to understand how these terror organisations operate and, armed with that knowledge, I wanted to prevent my own family, their friends and many other vulnerable British Muslims and non-Muslims from falling prey to these beasts. 'Having made some surreptitious enquiries, I met a Taliban fixer who, for a fee, escorted me to the training camp. What I learnt, and what I saw, filled me with dread. The place was far from a holiday camp, but I could see its appeal and excitement from a teenager’s point of view. 'It glamorised and normalised violence - it managed to make it appear acceptable.' The fundamentalist Islamic Taliban emerged in the early 1990s in northern Pakistan in the chaos and internecine warfare following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Starting with fewer than 50 armed madrassah students, the movement spread throughout Afghanistan by taking on corrupt warlords and cracking down on the widespread practice of 'bacha bazi', a form of child sex slavery. It ruled the country as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan from September 1996 until December 2001, with Kandahar as the capital, until the U.S.-led invasion in 2001. Now it leads the resistance to the occupation. 'There is nothing, absolutely nothing, which prepares you for the Taliban’s brutality,' Mr Sarwar said. Scroll down for video . In disguise: Mr Sarwar infiltrated the camp while on an aid mission to northern Pakistan . Cal Sarwar said a typical day in the Taliban training camp began with prayers at 4am. He said: 'To protect themselves and the camp, fighters sleep in shifts with at least three men on armed sentry duty at all times. 'If the others aren't sleeping, they will practice operations at night where drones can't see them from above. 'At 4am, or sunrise, morning prayers will start. For security reasons, such as in the event of an ambush, camp members will pray on a rota system. 'Prayers last for about 15 minutes and will include a reading from the Quran. Only after prayers do the occupants come together and eat breakfast in a communal space. 'At 5am, once breakfast has finished, the camp will plan the day's operations. There didn't seem to be a strict formula for the day's activities. Men would be told what to do in the morning. 'The camp generally seemed to separate in small groups, though. Some may undertake reconnaissance work, others will sit around cleaning weapons and waiting for orders. 'If members of the camp do head off from camp, they are under instructions to remain relatively close for safety reasons - usually a maximum of 30 minutes' walk. 'At around 8am, and if the men are in camp, they will pray again. 'Taliban camps aren't generally permanent, so if the group decides to move on they will do so now. They don't generally move far, but will do so under heavy armed guard. 'Interestingly, some of the men will go back to their villages to check on their families and children. 'If the camp isn't moving on, they will eat in shifts at around midday. 'Like with everything, cooking is done on a rota basis; if people aren't cooking or out on patrol, they'll be sleeping. 'At 3pm there are generally more prayers, and again at 6pm following an evening meal. In the evening, most of the camp will be on high alert from the Pakistani military. 'Those left in the camp overnight will say their final prayers at around 9pm before sleeping in rota patterns.' Mr Sarwar witnessed the Taliban's brutality when he visited Pakistan on a four-week-long aid mission with The Equality Insaaf Human Rights Foundation in 2012. During his mission to distribute hygiene packs, he visited orphanages and madrassas across the Punjab and northern Pakistan, where he claims he witnessed clerics and elders beating and abusing young children. He witnessed kids as young as four receive vicious beatings - often for minor offences such as looking the wrong way, failing to recite a passage in the Quran correctly, or for talking during prayers. The beatings ranged in severity from slaps to 'full-blown' attacks with bats, sticks or metal poles. It was not uncommon for children aged between four and 16 to suffer from broken bones, he said. 'They justified these beatings by claiming that the children were not being ""proper"" Muslims and that they had to be taught a lesson,' said Sarwar. 'This is a culture where forced education and corporal punishment go hand-in-hand. 'It's a culture where children are made to fear their elders, and Islam generally, from a very, very young age.' Nevertheless orphanages were recruiting grounds for the terrorists, who took advantage of the youngsters’ vulnerability and desire to find a family environment. It was in the Pakistani city of Multan, in the Punjab region, where Sarwar decided to learn more about the Taliban and attempt to infiltrate their ranks. He drove north to an area known for its strong links with the Taliban, where he 'put the word out' among local sympathisers. Within a few days, a deal was cut with a tribal elder who arranged for Sarwar to meet a ‘fixer’, a former Afghan Army soldier called Masood, in the dangerous Shawal Valley of North Waziristan. Masood, who was carrying a pistol, escorted Mr Sarwar to a Taliban settlement where he was grilled by an armed leader about his intentions. 'I was questioned for 45 minutes under the watchful eye of his guards - and I was terrified,' said Mr Sarwar. 'He said the Taliban needed money, so I told them that I could arrange this for them in the UK. This seemed to do the trick - it was the ""in"" I needed.' He was asked to return the following day, and was taken back to the camp in a 4x4 packed with armed insurgents. 'This was the only time that I genuinely believed that I may be killed - that I was being whisked away into the middle of the mountains for some heinous purpose,' said Sarwar. But to his surprise, he was welcomed 'with open arms' and went on to meet many of the camp’s members. He also caught a glimpse of their weapons cache - a tent packed with bags of pistols, Kalashnikov assault rifles, and ammunition. One of the leaders told him that the camp was 'doing well' and that it was training seven or eight British men from London. Scary: Taliban militants brandish their weapons in this file picture taken in Kandahar in 2001 . Mr Sarwar was later offered full training at the 'academy' in exchange for £1,000. This, he was told, would be used to fund training facilities and to buy bomb-making components. Feigning interest, he left after two days on the pretence of getting the cash - but never returned. He said: 'It was incredible to think that I managed to meet - and be invited to join - the Taliban within just seven days. 'If I was able to accomplish this on a whim and without any prior research, it is no surprise that British youngsters are being recruited by the Taliban, ISIS and others.' Mr Sarwar said the experience will help him to protect his own children from joining homegrown terror cells, or from becoming ‘lone wolfs’. He decided to write a fictionalised account of his experiences in a bid to engage with more people and provide insight into the 'terrorist mind-set and machinery'. The book - The Cell, The Wolf & The Faith: They Love Death More Than We Love Life - published by E&P, is now on sale in print and eBook format. Mr Sarwar chose not to publish the book, written as a thriller, under a pseudonym. 'As a Muslim myself I am not in any way criticising Islam, a religion I hold dear to my heart,' he said. 'I have had my manuscript read by many Islamic scholars and clerics from around the world and I have been assured my book does not contain anything blasphemous, insulting or derogatory about any religion or faith including Islam. 'I criticise only the tiny proportion of Muslims who continue to use the name of Islam in vain and for their own political or militarist purposes.'","Cal Sarwar was in Pakistan doing aid work when he decided to join jihadis .

"Charlottesville's police chief said Monday that it's important not to rush the case against the man accused in the disappearance of a University of Virginia student, despite criticism of some of his decisions. About a week after Hannah Graham disappeared September 13, Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr came to the police station to ask for a lawyer. Matthew's apartment had just been searched and while not a suspect at the time, he was considered a 'person of interest.' He left the police without being charged and sped away, prompting police to issue an arrest warrant for reckless driving, authorities said. Scroll down for video . Patience: Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo (pictured addressing reporters at a briefing on October 5) says it's important not to rush the investigation into the man accused of kidnapping University of Virginia student Hannah Graham . 19-year-old Graham (left) disappeared last month and was last seen at a downtown bar with nurse's assistant Jesse Matthew (right) While Matthew was a fugitive, Virginia police added a charge of abduction with intent to defile in Graham's disappearance, and he was arrested several days later on a Texas beach. 'We caught some criticism when Mr. Matthew walked out that door on that Saturday afternoon. People couldn't understand: ""How do you just let the guy walk out the door?''' Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo said. 'We made a commitment to honor certain constitutional protections that people have in our criminal justice system, and as frustrating as it is, we want to be very careful to get it right, not to rush to judgment.' At a briefing earlier Monday, investigators asked people who knew Matthew, a former college football lineman and sometime cab driver, to come forward with information so that they can develop a better profile of him. As they did, about 35 people scoured an area of hundreds of square miles surrounding downtown. Matthew was arrested last month after fleeing the state of Virginia. He was found camping on a beach in Galveston, Texas. Pictured above on September 26, being escorted by federal authorities off a plane back in Virginia . Longo said in the interview that the goal of asking for more information about Matthew was to try to figure out areas he may have been familiar with as they assess where to focus their search. 'What are the places where he's most comfortable? ... If you were to take someone against their will, you're going to take them to someplace likely where you're comfortable. You're not going to go out in the dark and hope for the best,' he said. Police say forensic evidence also connects the 32-year-old Charlottesville man to the 2009 slaying of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student. Longo says hope is fading that they will be able to find Graham alive. Pictured above at a September 24 briefing . Longo declined to discuss the evidence against Matthew or whether he might be charged in the Harrington case. Asked whether he expects to find Graham alive, Longo said: 'Every day that passes is not a good sign. Every day that passes translates more to recovery than rescue. But at the end of the day, we still have to find Hannah Graham.' He said he thinks about the case constantly. 'I lay in bed at night going over, what have we done differently, what could we do differently?' he said.","Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo has come under fire for his handling of  Hannah Graham's disappearance .

"Changzi Deng was charged with aggravated assault after the incident in Austin, Texas . A man obsessed with his ex-girlfriend flew more than 7,000 miles from China to Texas to plead for a second chance, but stabbed her in the face with a fork when she rejected him. Changxi Deng was arrested last Wednesday on the University of Texas campus after being held by other students who witnessed the attack. The 22 year old had traveled to the US from his home in China in the hope of persuading his former girlfriend to rekindle their relationship. But after she rejected his advances, he allegedly pulled out a fork from his pocket and plunged it into his ex's face. Other students heard the girl, who has not been named, screaming and rushed to help. U.T. freshman Joe Thometz was the student who pushed Deng off the woman . 'I ran out and grabbed the guy's wrist and pushed him into the wall to get him off the girl and another guy ran over and separated the girl', Thometz told Kxan.com. Deng was held at the scene in Austin, Texas, and the bloody fork recovered. The girl suffered puncture wounds to her nose and was treated in hospital. Deng told investigators he had been in a relationship with the woman while they were both studying at university in China. He said his girlfriend enrolled in a Masters degree course at the University of Texas in Austin. Deng researched the masters program for himself so he could find out what classes his ex-girlfriend would be taking. Freshman Joe Thometz (pictured) broke up the assault by grabbing Deng's wrist and pushing him against a wall at the university campus . He then traveled to the U.S. and waited outside various classrooms at the university until he finally met up with her outside the Engineering-Science building. Investigators say the victim attempted to evade Deng and warned him that she would call police if he didn't leave her alone. 'They had studied similar classes for undergrad studies and so he had a good idea of what classes she was going to be taking,' said Sergeant Charles Bonnet. Deng was booked into jail and charged with aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury. His bond was set at $50,000 and he was ordered to not have any contact with the woman and stay at least 200 yards away from her.","Changxi Deng was arrested at the University of Texas after the attack .

"A Chinese mother of two disfigured by horrific tumours growing on her face has been told by doctors she will make a full recovery after the government said it would foot the bill for her surgery. Li Hongfang, 40, was shunned in public after a rare type of bone cancer caused tissue to grow under her skin, distorting her features beyond recognition. Ms Hongfang endured the condition, known as Chordoma, for more than a decade because she had no money to pay for the £60,000 (600,000 yuan) surgery. Suffering: Li Hongfang, pictured in hospital, was unable to afford £60,000 on her tumours without help . Intervention: The 40-year-old is now about to have surgery to help cure her condition - known as Chordoma - after her plight received international attention . But after her plight touched hearts around the world earlier this month, shaming the country's ailing health service on a global stage, the Communist government gave doctors all the money they needed to save her. Staff at Qianxian People’s Hospital, near Xi’an in western China’s Shaanxi province, are now doing all they can to rescue a woman, whose tumour-ridden face has found international sympathy. The hospital's medical director, Xue Gang, said: 'Our superiors told us specially that we should cure Li Hongfang’s illness at all costs.' Local government officials pledged to meet all costs for her surgery and ongoing radiotherapy to make sure the tumours stay away. Spokesman Si Dangku confirmed: 'We will pay and if we run out of funds, the regional government will pay.' Surgeon Pan Lin - from Xijing Hospital, where Hongfang is preparing for her operation - said the operation will make her look 'beautiful again'. Distorted features: Ms Hongfang originally thought a small swelling on her forehead was an insect bite - but gradually the tumours spread . 'I am NOT a monster': Li Hongfang, 40, has a rare condition which has caused tumours to grow on her face - but she is unable to afford treatment . 'The condition is rare but the tumours are benign so her life is not in danger,' he said. 'After the tumours have been removed we will provide some cosmetic surgery and she will end up a beauty again.' Ms Hongfang is now undergoing a series of pre-op tests before the surgery can begin. She said: 'I am so grateful to the people who made this happen.' 'I just want to look normal again, like I feel inside. I'm not a monster and I don't want to look like one.' Nightmare illness: The mother-of-two is shunned in public because of her rare condition. The tumours on her face have been growing for the last 10 years . Grief: Li Hongfang was hit by the death of her husband shortly after she was diagnosed with Chordoma . The woman she used to be: Lu Hongfang with her son before the tumours began to grow . Ms Hongfang originally thought the first swelling on her forehead, which appeared in 2001, was an infected insect bite. 'It didn't even itch or ache in any way – but it also didn't go away and in fact just got bigger and bigger,' she said. Li Hongfang has Chordoma which is a type of bone cancer which causes tissue to grow. The most common place where the tumours begin to grow is in the skull and at the bottom of the spine. Although global figures are not available, in the US the cancer affects around one in a million people. In western countries, a sufferer would have the tumour removed before being given high doses of radiation therapy. But because of China's healthcare system, Ms Hongfang has been unable to afford proper care. The cancer may be rare, but there have been some instances of several members of the same family being hit by the tumours. When her condition was finally diagnosed four years later, doctors said she had seven tumours growing on her face. Ms Hongfang was living with her husband and two sons at the time, in Tianchao village, Qianxian county, in west China’s Shaanxi province. She said: 'We didn't have much money . but we were very happy and we loved each other and our two boys. I would . say life was good then.' Soon after wards, her sorrows increased after her husband died. By . 2009 she met Guo Yingping, 40, an orphan, and the two became friends . and later married. Her two sons, now aged 17 and 14, have now left home . to work. She added: 'I know that a lot of people see me as a monster but I am just a normal woman and a mother inside.' The . mother of two is one of many victims of China's health service falling . apart when the old state system was dismantled and medical fees . introduced. Tens of millions of people, particularly those living in the countryside, cannot access a doctor and cannot afford treatment. Officials . are debating a programme which aims to provide health insurance for all . its 1.3billion people by 2020, but at present, the health . system falls far behind the needs of those it is supposed to be . treating.","Mother-of-two Li Hongfang, 40, had watched seven tumours grow on her face for the last TEN years .

"Fraud: Danielle Watson (pictured yesterday) said she had late-stage cervical cancer to claim donations, freebies and cut-price deals for her wedding . A young mother defrauded friends and kindhearted strangers out of thousands of pounds by claiming she had terminal cancer -and even deceived her own husband into thinking she was dying. Danielle Watson, 24, said she had late-stage cervical cancer from January 2012 to claim donations, freebies and cut-price deals for her upcoming wedding worth almost £10,000. The then 21-year-old administration assistant of Rowhedge, Essex, even brought forward her wedding by several months to April that year so she could walk up the aisle with new husband Chris before radiotherapy and chemotherapy made her hair fall out. But in fact she had minor surgery for a treatable gynaecological condition and had never been diagnosed with, or treated for, cancer. She aroused suspicions by failing to provide proof of her illness and demanding all donations be paid to her account. She then revealed in June 2012 that she was pregnant. She had denied six counts of fraud but - appearing pregnant again - dramatically changed her pleas on the first day of her trial at Basildon Crown Court, sitting in Southend, and now faces the prospect of a jail sentence. Rebecca Blain, for Watson, told the court that with an 18-month-old child and her second due in mid-November, her client had been worried about getting an immediate prison sentence. Mrs Blain said: ‘One of those she told was her then to-be husband. Her own family all fell under the umbrella of that lie. 'She has told friends and family and she will have to learn to live and come to terms with the fact that she has told them what are the most despicable lies.’ Recorder Gerard Pounder said Watson had ‘preyed on human kindness’ and he could not guarantee she would avoid a custodial sentence. Wedding planner Leigh Stewart gave Watson free help worth £1,100 through her Fantasy Dream Events business and then helped raise thousands more in donations. Speaking outside court the 52-year-old mother of six said she had since closed down her business, partly because of what happened. And she still wants to know why Watson did it. Mrs Stewart said: ‘It’s appalling, she affected my family, my life, my work. Not just me, lots of people. I think she needs help. It is not a logical mind that does that.’ Marriage: Danielle Watson with her husband Chris on their wedding day. She had minor surgery for a treatable gynaecological condition and had never been diagnosed with, or treated for, cancer . Mrs Stewart, from Billericay, said she became suspicious after people pointed out that Watson did not look ill, saying the fraudster ‘became defensive’ and told her ‘I don’t have to prove anything to anyone’. When an anonymous benefactor made contact after an article in the Basildon Echo and offered to pay for Watson’s first round of vitamin C treatment she was ‘a bit funny about it’, Mrs Stewart added. The money Mrs Stewart raised for Watson has been given to the Mercedes Curnow Foundation in Cornwall, which helps people with cervical cancer, she said. Essex Police investigating officer Detective Constable Rob Lewis said: ‘Danielle Watson acted in a cold and calculated manner. ‘She befriended and abused the trust of kind and generous people who wanted to help a person they thought was dying. ‘She obtained significant financial gain, gifts and services from the kind hearted and at no point throughout the investigation did she demonstrate any form of remorse or shoulder the responsibility for her conduct. Closed down her company: Wedding planner Leigh Stewart (with her husband Adam), who gave free help worth £1,100 through her Fantasy Dream Events business and helped raise thousands in donations for Watson . ‘Watson’s actions attracted national media coverage and sadly the greatest impact a case of this nature will have is that it could undermine future public fundraising efforts for genuine causes. ‘Everyone involved will be that bit more cautious and cynical the next time they are asked to make a donation.’ Eventually caught: Watson aroused suspicions by failing to provide proof of her illness and demanding all donations be paid to her account . He added that the Mercedes Curnow Foundation received £6,563. The court had earlier heard that friends and complete strangers gave Watson money and held fundraising events to provide cash for additional ‘vitamin C treatment’ after being told she had a 15 to 20 per cent chance of survival. Others gave free or cut-price deals including a wedding dress worth £699 after hearing of her plight. She also got free haircuts and a reduced deal - including free champagne - on her wedding reception at the Ivory Rooms venue in Billericay. Prosecutor Marcus Croskell said Watson was ‘involved in many aspects of fundraising from their conception’. He added: ‘At no stage was she told by a medical professional that she had any form of cancer, let alone stage four cervical cancer, and she has never had treatment for it. 'Any such assertions are dishonest and false.’ Others events including a £1,640 Twitter auction, raffles, cake sales and fundraising nights at which she appeared raised almost £10,000 towards the vitamin C treatment, which costs £6,000 per cycle, the jury of seven women and five men heard. Some of those involved were people she knew but others came forward after hearing about her plight. In one interview with the Basildon Echo the then admin assistant for the Financial Services Authority in London said she had ‘terminal’ cancer and added that she was ‘hoping for a miracle’, the jury was told. In an interview for Full House magazine, carried out by a press agency, she said she had stage four cervical cancer with a ‘low chance’ of survival, Mr Croskell added. In fact she had undergone keyhole surgery after an obstetrician said she may be suffering from ovarian polyps. The court heard that she told one friend that the bandage from the keyhole surgery was from a positive cancer biopsy. Those who helped included Ms Stewart and Barclays worker Victoria Oliver, who held fundraising events at the bank after Watson came in to open an account for funds. Mr Croskell added: ‘She (Watson) encouraged parties to offer their goods, services money and time for free or reduced rates because of her purported illness.’ Watson was released on bail, to be sentenced on January 9.","Danielle Watson claimed donations, freebies and cut-price deals for wedding .

"Overweight claimants should have their benefits cut if they do not exercise enough, councils declared yesterday. Rent subsidies paid through housing and council tax benefits may be ‘varied’ depending on whether they obey instructions to go swimming or to gyms and yoga classes, a think-tank said. Proposals for town halls to promote healthy lifestyles added that shops should be given cash from council taxpayers to stock more fruit and vegetables. Bigger picture: Rent subsidies paid through housing and council tax benefits may be ¿varied¿ depending on whether they obey instructions to go swimming or to gyms and yoga classes, a think-tank said . The ideas were put forward as councils prepare to take over more than £2billion which previously went to the NHS for public health campaigns. Cutting benefits for the obese was suggested by Westminster council and the Local Government Information Unit, a council-funded think-tank. Philippa Roe, leader of the flagship Tory authority, said: ‘This report contains exactly the sort of bright, forward-thinking and radical ideas that need to be looked at.’ The document suggested that financial pressure on the jobless and unhealthy could begin this spring when control of state public health programmes shifts to town halls. Opportunity: Philippa Roe, Leader of Westminster Council said: 'This report contains exactly the sort of bright, forward-thinking and radical ideas that need to be looked at.¿ . The changes will see GPs given powers to prescribe activity at public leisure centres to patients they consider take too little exercise. The rise of smart cards means their activities can be monitored more easily. The Westminster report said town halls should ‘link welfare measures to behaviours that promote public health’. It added: ‘Several authorities have schemes that allow GPs to prescribe physical activities at local facilities, including council swimming pools, gyms, yoga and walking clubs. ‘The increasing use of smart cards for access to leisure facilities, for instance, provides a significant amount of data. ‘Where an exercise package is prescribed, housing and council tax benefit could be varied to reward or incentivise residents.’ Subsidies to shops could be given in ‘food deserts’ where campaigners contend it is hard to buy healthy food, the report added. But Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said public money should not be used to ‘meddle’ with what shops sell. The £2billion kitty paid for NHS ‘five-a-day’ co-ordinators and publicity campaigns devised by the last Labour government. In other Coalition reforms, councils also have new powers to cut the benefits they pay if claimants behave in an anti-social way.","The initiative could see obese people prescribed activity sessions by GPs .

"A sign hung from the overpass of a major motorway has sparked outrage over the racist slogan it was splashed with. The words '""Multiculturalism"" is white genocide' were written in thick white lettering on a black banner. The sign was spotted on the Watland Overpass across the M1 in the Logan suburb of Springwood in Queensland, according to a post on the Logan Memes Facebook page. First surfacing online on Sunday evening, the offensive banner was slammed by many locals on the Facebook page who branded it 'disgusting' and 'ignorant'. This racist banner appeared on the Watland Overpass across the M1 in the Logan suburb of Springwood in Queensland at the weekend . One user wrote: 'Sadly some people do think like that its why the world is such a mess'. Another said: 'People actually think like that???' Local man Zach Powson told the Courier Mail he was completely outraged when he saw the image, saying it was difficult to see such offensive behaviour so close to home. Mr Powson - who grew up in Logan - said: 'Why is this still going on, can’t we learn from history. There needs to be more of an acceptance of the different cultures.' Logan City Council confirmed to Daily Mail Australia they were aware of the sign and notified the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads (DTMR). 'As soon as we became aware of it we sent people to look for it', DTMR told Daily Mail Australia.

"Every dog has its day, but few canines get a motorcade on their return home. Kabang, who lost half her face after jumping in front of a motorcycle to save the lives of two girls, received a rousing welcome Monday in Zamboanga, a city in the southern Philippines. The mixed-breed came back from months-long treatment at the University of California, Davis, veterinary hospital, paid for with $27,000 in donations raised in the Philippines and abroad. She was reunited with her owner, Rudy Bunggal, and the girls she saved from the accident in December 2011 - the owner's daughter, Dina, and cousin Princess Diansing. 'She is not just my friend, she is like a part of our family,' 13-year-old Dina Bunggal said. Scroll down for video .

Kabang and Rudy Bunggal rode in the . back of a pickup truck festooned with yellow balloons to the Municipal . Hall, where Mayor Celso Lobregat bestowed the title 'Pride of Zamboanga' on the dog. Motorcycles and cars took part in the . motorcade that drove Kabang through the port city. Residents snapped . photos of the dog and kids petted her. At the mayor's office, Kabang was . given a bag of treats. But all is not well in Kabang's household. Rudy Bunggal, who told reporters he . was struggling with drinking and financial problems, asked the . veterinarian who had accompanied Kabang to the U.S., Anton Lim, to . temporarily care for the dog. The Philippine Daily Inquirer also quoted Bunggal's wife, Christina, as saying the couple has separated. The husband, who worked as a . mechanic, now lives alone in a shanty and found a new job as a . construction worker, earning less than $5 a day. The mongrel dog has endured months of surgery and treatment on the other side of the world after her story became went viral. Sadly, doctors couldn't reconstruct .

Full treatment of that condition was put on hold during cancer therapy. Kabang had the first of three arsenic-based heartworm shots on December 4 and received the other two in the second week of January. 'It will be one to two months for her to recover from that before she goes in and has the surgery,' Davis said in December. Helping a hero: Kabang's facial surgery was been postponed after veterinarians at University of California at Davis discovered a tumour and heartworm . Good girl: Kabang was hailed as a hero in the Philippines after saving two girls by jumping in front of a speeding bike, which left her severely disfigured . Treatment: Dr. Anton Lim plays with Kabang after her arrival  at the William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at University of California Davis . The horrific accident occurred in . December 2011 when the daughter of Kabang’s owner, nine-year-old Dina . Bunggal, and her cousin three-year old Princess Diansing, were playing . with the dog in Zamboanga City, Philippines. The . dog ended up in Davis hospital in 2012 after a nurse from Buffalo, New . York, spearheaded a fundraising campaign to bring her to the U.S. Veterinarians in the Philippines were apparently unable to treat her . injuries. Care For Kabang raised over $20,000 from 22 countries to cover the costs of surgeries, visas and airfare. Surgeons were planning to perform two or three procedures. The first involved dental work, extractions and covering exposed roots. They then closed the dog's wound and restore nasal functions. Prior to the surgeries, the dog's bony structures were exposed to air, increasing the chance of infection, Davis said. Kabang will now return to he owners in the Philippines. The bill for her treatment is expected to top $10,000. Close call: Doctors in the Philippines suggested that Kabang's owner put her down, but he would hear none of it . Grateful dog: Kabang was found in a rice paddy as a puppy and was nearly killed for meat, but her owner's daughter and niece pleaded for her life . Global effort: A New York nurse helped raise more than $20,000 from 22 countries to pay for Kabang's medical care in the U.S. Davis said in December that despite Kabang's many conditions, the dog appeared to be in good spirits. 'She has come through everything very well,' Davis said. 'Her appetite is still good. She's still bright and happy.' Kabang's face became tangled in the spokes of the bike's wheel, and her entire upper jaw was torn off. Kabang, who became a mother to six . little puppies in April 2012, had a rough start in life when Dina's . father Rudy found her abandoned in a rice paddy. He brought the dog home to fatten her . up and feed her to the family, but his daughter and niece convinced him . to spare Kabang and keep her as a pet - a lucky move for both dog and . family.","Kabang the dog's  snout and upper jaw sheared off in December 2011 when she jumped in front of a motorcycle in the Philippines .

"Residents have been left baffled after bungling council workers put up a 20mph speed limit sign on a footpath. The notice was put up by Nottingham City Council in the Radford area of the city as part of a £147,000 road safety scheme. But the sign in Dulwich Road was placed at a dead end in front of a set of bollards, which enclose a pedestrian-only zone in the residential area. A Nottingham City Council worker removes the 20mph sign that was put up in error at the end of a footpath . Dorothy Francis, 89, who has lived in the area all her life, said: ‘It’s bizarre, you can barely even get a bicycle through the gap in those bollards never mind a car. ‘The sign is actually on the pavement, it’s not like it’s a few yards before, there would be no chance to get up to speed before you hit the bollards. ‘I know we old dears can hit some speed in our mobility scooters but this is taking it a bit too far.’ Another resident, Anne Simpson, 54, said: ‘I can’t believe it, I don’t think it’s the only place they have done something stupid like this either. A woman with a pushchair walks past the pedestrian zone in Dulwich Road where the sign was put up . A man inspects the bizarre location choice for the sign after residents call the error 'daft' and 'not needed' ‘It cost money to put that up too, and it will never make any kind of difference. ‘What will they do next? Install a speed camera to make sure we don’t run too fast?’ Rich Holmes, 26, who also lives nearby, said: ‘It’s a bit daft. ‘You would have thought people would have common sense and not put the sign up with the bollards right there.’ A footpath is not the only place where residents claim a sign is not needed. Another street nearby has a 20mph sign attached to a lamppost - but it is just a 45 metre stretch. Darren Warner, 27, added: ‘It’s impossible to go that quick on these streets anyway, so what’s the point of the signs?’ A spokeswoman from Nottingham City Council said the sign was put up in error and it has now been removed . A Nottingham City Council spokeswoman confirmed the Dulwich Road sign was erected in error and said it has now been removed. She said: ‘The scheme is still under construction and so the checks to pick up on issues like this are yet to be carried out. ‘Changes like this are implemented before speed limit orders come into effect. ‘20mph limits are being introduced in residential areas across the city and have been shown to bring a number of benefits, such as reduced traffic noise, safer junctions and improved air quality.’","Speed warning put up by Nottingham City Council in Radford area of city .

"A teacher who was bullied as a teenager because of her weight has won a competition to be the face of a supermarket's new plus-size clothing range. Maria Garcia-Perez, 26, beat 800 hopefuls to be crowned Aldi's 'Real Model' winner to launch a new range of ladies size 14 to 24 clothing. Maria was the target of bullies at school before adapting her diet and finding her 'happy weight' at around a size 16 to 18 . Maria, who entered the contest after seeing an advert at her local Aldi store, impressed the panel of judges with her body confidence and natural curves . Miss Garcia-Perez, a French and Spanish teacher from Derby, entered the competition after spotting an advert in her local Aldi store. She was a size 20 aged 14 and found herself the target of bullies in the playground. At that time she decided she wanted to adopt a more balanced diet and dropped a couple of dress sizes. Now a size 16 to 18, she has finally found her 'happy weight' which makes her 'feel most healthy'. And it seems to have paid off as her body confidence and natural curves really wowed the judges, resulting in her being crowned the winner. As part of her prize, Maria was the centre of a professional photoshoot . The contest was judged by a panel which included fashion consultant and former agent to Jerry Hall and Naomi Campbell, Jonathan Phang. A size 20 at only age 14, Maria eventually decided to change her diet and eat more healthy foods . As a child, Maria was a target for school bullies due to her size, which effected her self confidence . Mr Phang said: 'Choosing Maria as our winner was a unanimous decision from the panel. 'She's a beautiful, body-confident woman who deserved the chance to become the face of Aldi's new clothing range which celebrates real women.' Miss Garcia-Perez said: 'The other children at school would tease me about my weight, but I didn't let it bother me too much. 'At the age of 14 I was a size 20 and my clothes were getting tighter, so I decided it was time I did something about it. 'I joined a gym and I started to eat mainly salad and yoghurt. I lost 20kg (3 stone 1 pound) in four months and slimmed to a size 10. 'But I realised I wasn't happy this way, so I began to introduce carbohydrates back into my diet and have more varied meals. The contest was judged by a panel which included fashion consultant and former agent Jonathan Phang . 'I'm now a size 16 to 18 and it's the size my body is most comfortable. I still go to the gym three times a week, I eat healthily and I'm happy with myself. 'When I saw the competition in Aldi, I just thought 'why not?' 'But I never thought I would win! I couldn't believe it when they said I'd been chosen as the winner and I'd be doing a photoshoot. 'It was incredible and I am extremely proud. 'Aldi's new range gives larger women more choice at affordable prices without compromising on quality. 'It's not all about being stick thin and being skinny doesn't necessarily mean you are healthy.' Tony Baines, Managing Director for Corporate Buying at Aldi, said: 'There's definitely demand for good quality clothing that fits well, looks good, doesn't cost the earth and is representative of the overall population. 'Maria is the perfect real model to showcase our new size 14 to 24 ladies' clothing range. 'It offers a complete autumn/winter capsule wardrobe of stylish, quality clothing and accessories - great for women who want to look good and spend less.' The budget supermarket's new clothing range celebrates 'real women' and hit the shelves on Sunday. It includes cardigans, skirts, tops, tights, jeans and socks. A pair of 'wide fit socks' cost £3.49 while the 'chunky cardigan' are £10.99 pounds. The 'jeans plus size' cost £9.99.","Maria was the target of bullies at school before adapting her diet .

"A pet dog had to be rescued by a fire crew after getting stuck in a hole in a wall. Junior, a German shepherd Collie cross, had to be drilled out from the wall in his owner's house after poking his head through the space once used for a tumble dryer vent while he was in the garden. When his owner Raymond Edmonds went to let the dog back inside the house in Wolverhampton, he was shocked to see the animal's body sticking out from the wall - with his head firmly wedged in the hole. Junior, a German shepherd Collie cross, became stuck in the wall after poking his head through an old tumble dryer vent . West Midlands Fire Service firefighters arrived at the house in Wolverhampton and drilled the animal to safety . After trying to free him with shampoo, Mr Edmonds was forced to phone the fire brigade for help. 'It was raining outside and I could hear Junior barking out in the garden but when I went to the porch to let him in I had the shock of my life,' he said. 'He had pushed his head through an old vent for a dryer I used to have and he was just peering at me through the wall. 'I was so shocked and I didn't know what on earth to do.' The 33-year-old phoned West Midlands Fire Service to the house where firefighters were able to cut the animal free. Raymond Edmonds tried freeing the dog by lathering him up with shampoo before having to phone the fire service for help . The 'crazy' animal was not harmed in the process of being freed but won't be sticking his head in any other holes in the near future, said his owner . Once recovered, Mr Edmonds, who is a DJ, released photographs of his pet's ordeal to showcase the fire crew's good work. 'Junior is a crazy dog and he coped with the ordeal really well. The firefighters who attended did an excellent job of getting Junior out of the hole, without distressing him. 'It’s safe to say, Junior won’t be putting his head in any other holes in a hurry.'","Junior the dog poked his head through an old tumble dryer vent in garden .

"Fiona Wardrop used to be a 132kg, mother-of-three with a self-esteem that was at rock bottom. Having battled with her weight since the age of 10, she's transformed herself from a size 26 to a size 6 after losing 84kg. But it all came at a cost as the 32-year-old had to tap into her superannuation to pay for two of her surgeries. Scroll down for video . Fiona Wardrop dropped 84kg after a sleeve gastrectomy which surgically removes a large portion of the stomach . The mother-of-three used to be 135kg and says she's been overweight since she was a child . Going under the knife was the last resort for Ms Wardrop, of Wattle Grove in south-west Sydney, who had tried all methods of diets you could name. 'I've always been big so I knew nothing else,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I tried everything. The diet shakes and the diet pills but I always gave up too early. Exercising was always part of my life but that didn't work either.' That life she once knew was taking a toll on her physically and mentally. 'In one sitting I could consume one to two pizzas and would have at least two litres of coke a day. Salad was out of my vocabulary,' Ms Wardrop said. 'On the outside, I was a confident and loud person but behind closed doors I hated myself and my body.' But one day she woke up and realised she could no longer live the way she had been for the last 20 years. So in 2012 she decided to finally do something for herself. 'I didn't realise how big I was until I looked at myself in photos,' Ms Wardrop said. 'I knew this was the time for me to do something for myself because I was embarrassed to be around my husband and my kids.' So came the decision to undergo a sleeve gastrectomy, a potentially life-threatening surgery which cost about $10,000 in September 2012. 'It's a surgery which removes about 85 per cent of the stomach so yes there was a high risk involved,' she said. 'I decided to do it because I knew this was it for me and because I didn't have the money I used my superannuation funds to pay for it.' But even after going from 135kg to 51kg, Ms Wardrop felt unhappy with her significantly reduced reflection. 'I felt like a man because I went from a G cup to having no breast tissue and there was a lot of skin to cut away,' she said. Fiona on her wedding day in 2010 (left) and post weight-loss surgery (right) Fiona and her husband Steve married in 2010 but renewed their vows in July this year . Ms Wardrop says she can now stand proud next to her husband and kids . So the second phase of Ms Wardrop's transformation came when she met plastic surgeon Dr Barnouti Laith in 2013. 'He's the one who changed me,' she said. That's when she opted for a tummy tuck, breast implants and lift which cost a total of $23,000. 'After the surgery I was finally been able accept myself,' Ms Wardrop said. 'But by then I'd cleared out my superannuation.' And it's a decision that she doesn't regret. 'This has added 20 years to my life,' she said. 'I see my reflection now and I think ""wow I can't believe I look like that"". 'I feel younger, healthier and happier. I can run around with the boys and I can keep up with them. 'It's the best feeling and now I can stand proud next to my husband and kids.' Ms Wardrop says she couldn't have done it without the support of her three kids and husband Steve. So become an improved version of herself, Ms Wardrop decided to renew her vows in July. 'I did it because I've always wanted to look like a princess on my wedding day and that's exactly how I felt,' she said.","Fiona Wardrop dropped 84kg after a sleeve gastrectomy which surgically removes about 85 per cent of the stomach .

"Former International Olympic Committee marketing chief Michael Payne . criticised the organising committee for 'scoring an own goal' over . exclusivity rights. A leading Olympic brand expert last night hit out at the draconian clampdown on local shopkeepers and businesses using the Games logo. Former International Olympic Committee marketing chief Michael Payne criticised the organising committee for ‘scoring an own goal’ over exclusivity rights. He said that the over-zealous rules are ‘suffocating local street traders’, in the light of critics dubbing London 2012 the ‘Censorship Games’. Mr Payne added that guidelines were . ‘never intended to shut down the flower shop that put its flowers in . Olympic rings in the window’. He . told the Independent: ‘The controls and protections have gone too far . when it is starting to suffocate local street traders and I don’t think . that is necessarily what the Olympic sponsors are looking for. ‘The public do get it. They do . understand that Coca-Cola has paid, Pepsi hasn’t, so Coca-Cola should be . entitled to provide the soft drinks. But what’s that got to do with a . flaming torch baguette in a café?’ Mr Payne was behind revolutionary sponsorship deals that he claims saved the Olympic Games from dying out in the 1980s. Mr Payne’s comments were echoed by . London Mayor Boris Johnson, who warned against ‘insanity’ when it came . to policing usage of the five interlocking rings. Mr Johnson told Sky News: ‘If you want to stick five doughnuts in your window and call them Olympic rings, then be my guest.’ It . came after Lord Coe hit out at the negative headlines which have dogged . the countdown to the Olympics, insisting organisers were on course to . deliver a successful Games. Lord Coe, who is chairman of the . organising committee Locog, said people were ‘overwhelmingly very . positive’ about the Games, despite concerns over security, transport and . strict sponsorship rules. Staying positive: Both Boris Johnson and Lord Coe have continued to talk up the positives of the Games and Boris echoed concerns saying blocking usage of the logo was insanity . Draconian: A florist in Stoke-on-Trent was ordered to take down this Olympic-themed window display after being warned she was breaching copyright laws . ‘There . are things we have done really well,’ he insisted, referring to praise . he had received from athletes and the international media about the . facilities built for London 2012. In an interview on Radio 4’s Today . programme yesterday, Lord Coe defended the Games organisers from claims . that there had been a heavy-handed approach to protecting sponsors’ rights. Today presenter Evan Davis asked Lord Coe whether he would be allowed to turn up to an event in a Pepsi T-shirt. Lord . Coes said: ‘No, you probably wouldn’t be walking in with a Pepsi . T-shirt because Coca-Cola are our sponsors and they have put millions of . pounds into this project but also millions of pounds into grassroots . sport. It is important to protect those sponsors.’ Hours after his interview on Today, Locog said Olympic ticket-holders would be ‘free to wear the clothing of their choice’ inside Games venues, despite his earlier comment. Pride: The bagels were put up ahead of the Olympic torch relay, which will pass by at the weekend . The run up to the London Games has seen organisers coming down hard on anyone they deem to be breaching the strict brand protection rules. Last week a cafe manager in Camberwell, south London was raided by ‘community wardens’ after he displayed five bagels in the style of the Olympics rings in his window. Two ‘community wardens’ swooped on the House Cafe and Gallery, in Camberwell, within 20 minutes of manager David Adams putting up the display. They claimed that putting the circular buns on show breached copyright rules. One customer said: ‘They were being quite aggressive to David, ordering him to take them down immediately and threatening him with court and fines. They said there would be very serious consequences if he did not obey them. ‘It was just some bread hanging in a window, for goodness sake! When a few customers such as myself started telling them off for being silly, they began taking pictures of us on their camera, which I found sinister.' In May a florist from Stoke-on-Trent was ordered to take down a tissue paper window display of the rings she had put up to mark the the Olympic torch relay due passing through her town. Trading standards officials warned her that the rings constituted an ‘unauthorised use’ of the Olympic logo and left her at risk of being sued by Games organisers. Lisa Cross, 33, said at the time: ‘The trading standards officers said they really loved the display, but told us we’d have to take it down or we could be sued. 'We’ve only been running the shop for 16 months. I couldn’t fight it against them, they are a big organisation. I’m trying to grow my business, not ruin it.’ ‘I had no idea I was breaking any rules. I just wanted to support Team GB and the Olympics.' A spokesman for Games organiser Locog said: ‘Wherever Locog or trading standards officers see unauthorised use of the word “Olympics” or registered trademarks, we will take the time to explain to the business owner why they cannot do that.’ He added: ‘In general we will pursue a course of education, rather than litigation. Last year Kamel Kichane, manager of Cafe Olympic in Stratford was forced to change the name of his business to Cafe Lympic after being warned he could face legal action over the use of the word.","Former .

"A boy racer who killed his 19-year-old girlfriend while driving at 'ludicrous' speeds was jailed for six years today. Reckless Paul Reddan, 21, was racing another car when he lost control of his silver Vauxhall Corsa SRi at 70mph in a 50mph zone, hit a war memorial and crashed into a wall. The car burst into flames and Leanne Davies, a trainee hairdresser who was in the front passenger seat, died at the scene from severe head injuries. Leanne Davies, a trainee hairdresser, had sneaked away from her parents on the night of the fatal tragedy because they disapproved of her on-and-off relationship with her boyfriend Paul Reddan, an engineer . A number of witnesses said Paul Reddan had been driving on the wrong side of the road while he had been allegedly racing with Matthew Creed on a stretch of road for at least two miles before the fatal crash . Reddan, an engineer, was found guilty of death by dangerous driving and jailed for six years and banned from driving for five years at Gloucester Crown Court today. Sentencing, Judge Jamie Tabor said: 'Leanne was by all accounts a lovely young girl. 'She had the world before her – then her life was taken away by this absolutely ludicrous driving.' He told Reddan, who turned 21 today: 'I have no doubt at all that you were racing that night. From the moment you got in the car you were driving too fast. 'You were racing in such a way that one witness thought someone would get killed. 'You had been racing for a very long part of your journey in a very dangerous manner. You lost control of your vehicle and you killed Leanne – that is the long and short of it.' The crumpled Vauxhall Corsa which Reddan had bought just three months before the crash in Gloucester . The court heard how Leanne, of Lydbrook, Glos., secretly met up with Reddan on the night of May 31 last year because her parents did not approve of their on-off relationship. She told them she was going to meet her grandmother, but actually went for food at McDonald's with Reddan before getting into his car at around 9pm. But while travelling along the A4136 near Longhope, Glos., he lost control on a bend, hit a war memorial and crashed into a wall. Matthew Creed, 19, was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving in the six-day trial which ended today . It was alleged he was racing Matthew Creed, 19, who was also charged with causing death by dangerous driving but was cleared after a six-day trial. A number of witnesses described how Reddan's Corsa had been very close to Mr Creed's Renault Clio and at one point it was even being driven on the wrong side of the road. The prosecution alleged that the two men had been racing each other for at least two miles before the fatal crash which left Reddan hospitalised for three weeks. One witness, Andrew Barnes, who saw the two cars flash past less than a car length apart, only a few hundred metres before the collision, said 'someone is going to die', the court heard. Leanne's parents, Paul and Heather, said their whole family had been affected by the loss of the hairdresser . An examination of Reddan's car following the incident showed the speedometer stuck at 60mph, the back tyres under-inflated and a defect in the brake pipe. It was concluded that the car's faults, in combination with the 'manner of driving', could have caused the vehicle to become unstable. In a victim impact statement read in court, Leanne's father Paul Davies said: 'The hardest thing to come to terms with is to think about all the things we can no longer do as a family. 'We recently attended a family wedding and I could not stop thinking about the fact I will never get to walk my only daughter down the aisle. Father Paul Davies said in a victim impact statement read in court today that the 'the hardest thing to come to terms with is to think about all the things we can no longer do as a family' and that he was 'angry' over the loss . 'Whatever the outcome of this case and whatever the sentence, Paul will always have his life and future, but Leanne will never have that.' Mr Davies said the loss of his daughter had affected 'every single aspect of my life' and he was angry he would never be able to walk her down the aisle for her wedding one day. His two sons Luke and Mitch had been badly affected, too and the whole family had received counselling and support, he said. 'The biggest surprise after this incident is that there has been absolutely no remorse shown by Paul Reddan whatsoever. 'We received one letter from him but he didn't even say he was sorry. He did say 'I am sorry you lost Leanne' but there was no hint of sorrow or regret about what had happened. Leanne Davies' parents Paul and Heather (pictured left) with the family liaison officer PC Steve Martin and one of Leanne's brothers Luke Davies, outside  Gloucester Crown Court following the sentencing of Paul Reddan . 'It appears to have had no effect on him whatsoever.' Heather Davies, Leanne's mother, said: 'At just 19 she had her whole life ahead of her. Her dreams and ambitions will now be unfulfilled because of the events of that night.' She said Leanne had an argument with her dad that night about a forthcoming family holiday and whether Reddan would be joining them because of the on-off nature of their relationship at that time . Mr Davies had regretted the row ever since because it had been the last time he saw his daughter. The couple were asleep on the sofa in front of the TV at midnight when police arrived to tell them Leanne had been killed, said Mrs Davies. 'I will never be able to forgive Paul Reddan for what happened that night,' she said. The crumpled Corsa after the fatal crash which claimed the life of trainee hairdresser Leanne Davies, 19 . 'My only hope is that one day life will become easier and I can remember Leanne for who she was: my beautiful loving daughter.' Jason Coulter, acting for Reddan, said he had led an honest and industrious life and had no previous convictions - and was never likely to offend again. He accepted, however, that not long before the tragedy Reddan had been driving at 120mph, when a passenger took a picture of his speedometer. Mr Coulter said that although Reddan had not appeared remorseful in public his mother had seen him in tears at home and he 'very much mourns the passing of Leanne.' The solicitor also handed the judge a letter written by Reddan expressing his sorrow. Reddan had worked for his employers for two and a half years, had completed an engineering apprenticeship, and was earning £25,000 as a buyer of equipment for industrial pipework, he added. The court heard that the back tyres of Reddan's Corsa were under-inflated and there was a defect in the brake pipe and, in combination with the 'manner of driving', could have caused the vehicle to become unstable . Reddan, of Broadwell, Glos., had passed his test in January 2012 and had got the 1.8 litre car less than three months before the smash, the court heard. Passing sentence Judge Tabor told Reddan he had not seen any remorse from him and he had 'cut an arrogant figure in the witness box' showing a lack of sensitivity to Leanne's parents. The judge said he was satisfied Reddan had been 'racing for a very prolonged period in a very dangerous manner.' Reddan was told he will have to take an extended test before driving again and he will have to pay a £120 surcharge in addition to the jail term and ban. Leanne's family released a statement after today's sentencing in which they said 'We, the family of Leanne Davies, welcome the verdict handed down by the court today. 'We wish to thank the court, Mr Tully and his team at the CPS, and the police for their meticulous investigation into the truth of what happened that tragic evening. 'Our lives have been on hold since that night, whilst Mr Reddan has been able to carry on with his, showing no remorse whatsoever for his actions. 'We hope that with this trial now over we can start to move on with our lives and focus on our many fond memories of Leanne. 'And finally we would like to thank all of our friends and family for their continued support.' The officer in charge of the case, PC Tim Griffiths, said: 'It is nearly 18 months since the collision and during that time the family of Leanne Davies have been supported by one of the Constabulary's Family Liaison Officers. 'Leanne's family have remained dignified throughout the investigation and court process. 'It has been a long, painstaking investigation which has been reliant on the local community from Longhope and across the Forest of Dean who have supported our investigation. 'During this period my thoughts have remained with the family whilst focused on establishing one thing, what happened to Leanne. 'I remember one thing, a promise that I made to them: on behalf of the investigation team, that we would do our utmost to find out what happened to their daughter. 'This investigation and trial I hope has done just that, and though they will never ever get over the loss of their much loved and well-liked daughter, I hope that in some small way it helps them to move forward in their lives and to put this terrible tragedy behind them. 'My thoughts and condolences are with all of Leanne's family and friends at this very difficult time. 'The investigation team and I take no pleasure in this guilty conviction, as clearly we would prefer never to have had to conduct this investigation into what is clearly a very sad matter. 'It serves as a reminder to us all that cars, particularly when they are driven in such a manner, are killers in the wrong hands. 'Therefore, we must all strive to not only continue to improve the way in which we drive every day, but also accept the responsibility that we all have when we take to the road. He added: 'During the course of this trial this young man has not taken responsibility for his actions or the part he played in Leanne's death.'","Paul Reddan was driving his Vauxhall Corsa at 70mph along a 50mph zone .

"At just one week old and measuring three feet tall, she plods along between her mother’s legs on an estate in rural Bedfordshire. After spending 22 months waiting in her mother’s womb, the little elephant began walking within minutes of her arrival. The female calf is the newest resident to join Woburn Safari Park near Milton Keynes and is one of the few Asian elephants living in Britain. Scroll down for video . Leg up: The newborn elephant, which is yet to be named, is helped to its feet by its protective mother . Her parents, 20-year-old Damini and father Raja, also 20, live on the estate, owned by the Duke of Bedford, with a herd of five other elephants. At 19 stone, she already weighs more than most adults, but is expected to reach a weight of four tonnes and a height of almost 10 feet by the time she is fully grown. The calf, who has not yet been named, has spent the first week of her life bonding with her mother and exploring her new home. Steady now: The furry calf is up on its feet and walking just days after being born . She rarely strays from her mother’s side while Damini, which means electric, treads carefully around the newborn, always keeping her close. The elephants live in two paddocks at the park spending around 16 hours each day grazing on nearby trees and logs. The Asian elephant originally hails from Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. There are believed to be between 35,000 and 40,000 Asian elephants left in the world. Terry Shelton, head of elephants, at the park said: ‘Damini has taken to motherhood fantastically. Tiring work: The baby lies down in the grass for a nap after a tough day up on its feet . ‘She has been very relaxed, getting to know her newborn with gentle trunk touches whilst her new aunts, Chandrika and Yu-Zin, are able to watch the newborn take its first steps and suckle from Damini.’ The 15th Duke of Bedford, Andrew Russell, said: ‘The birth of our newborn elephant is a tribute to all of the elephant and veterinarian staff who have been working with and looking after Damini during her 22 month pregnancy. ‘It is a fantastic day for Woburn Safari Park and the ongoing conservation of these endangered animals.’ Woburn will be hosting a competition so that visitors can choose a name for the calf. The deadline for entries is November 7 with the name to be announced on November 22.","Female calf was born days ago at  Woburn Safari Park near Milton Keynes .

However half of British newlyweds  update their Facebook relationship status to 'married' within 24 hours of getting hitched. And 35 per cent of those who have just got engaged announce the news online in a day, and five per cent do so within the hour. Scroll down to video . Half of newlyweds update their Facebook relationship status to 'married' within 24 hours of getting hitched . The internet is influencing our big days more than ever as 13.72 per cent of couples who get married are most likely to meet through a dating website. And Britons' exposure to celebrity culture online also has its part to play when it comes to planning a wedding. The most popular colour scheme was revealed to be pink - mimicking a trend set by Hollywood A-Listers including Reece Witherspoon, Gwen Stefani, Jullianne Moore and Anne Hathaway, who all chose pink bridal gowns for their recent weddings. More than one in five brides (22.6 per cent) this year chose a wedding dress style featuring a touch of lace similar to the lace gown worn by the Dutchess of Cambridge in 2011 - by far the most popular style. Two thirds (64.73 per cent) of weddings go over budget as brides- and grooms-to-be strive to outdo one another, witnessing lavish weddings of the rich and famous in the lead up to their big day. The average wedding costs an eye-watering £20,000 and the average number of guests is 78. And religious ceremonies have continued to fall in popularity, with just only one in four ceremonies now considered to have religious sentiment. More than a third of those who have just got engaged announce the news online in a day . A new and growing tradition was revealed to be the selection of a theme, with 38 per cent of couples opting to personalise their nuptuals this way. These ranged from the unsurprising 'vintage' theme, to 'steampunk' or even 'Game of Thrones'. However, British brides have not completely discarded traditions, with 85 per cent of brides wearing something old, new, borrowed and blue, and a further 87 per cent were given away by their fathers. · 25.22 per cent meet through friends . · 24.34 per cent meet through work . · 14.60 per cent meet socialising (e.g. at a bar) · 13.72 per cent meet online . · 11.06 per cent meet at university . · 9.73 per cent meet at school . · 1.33 per cent meet at the gym .

"Ed Miliband’s position is made easier by the fact that none of his potential rivals has declared their hand. Many MPs want Alan Johnson, the popular former postman, to throw his hat into the ring – saying he has much greater appeal with voters than the awkward Mr Miliband. But Mr Johnson, who served as Home Secretary under Gordon Brown, has all but ruled himself out, claiming last month that he had ‘no appetite for being on the frontbench’. Scroll down for video . Next in line? Andy Burnham, left, has union backing, and Yvette Cooper, right, is the bookies' favourite . His refusal to put himself forward will force any plotters to look elsewhere. It seems the succession would come down to a face-off between shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary. The bookies are increasingly throwing their weight behind Mr Burnham, who made a well-received speech on the NHS at September’s Labour conference – in marked contrast to Mr Miliband’s famously poor effort. It is reported that, emboldened by his conference success, he is already canvassing support; particularly in the North West. Ladbrokes yesterday cut Mr Burnham’s chances of leading the party from 6/1 into 4/1 to be the next party leader, as more and more political punters back him. The former health secretary has also gained the support of militant union leader Len McCluskey who said last month Mr Burnham is the person who ‘most impresses’ him on the Labour frontbench. However, Miss Cooper is still favourite to take over if Mr Miliband goes; attracting odds of 7/2. She can at least count on the support of her husband, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who is unlikely to have much chance of victory on his own. Popular: Former postman Alan Johnson . Mr Johnson is further down the betting pecking order on 12/1. If none of these decide to stand, it could be left to younger frontbenchers such as Chuka Umunna (8/1), with Rachel Reeves and Tristram Hunt outside bets on 16/1. The man who Labour MPs and party members wanted to be leader – David Miliband – has odds of 20/1. But there is no chance of him taking the reins from his brother because he has stepped down as an MP and moved to the US. ... But the rules mean that it's impossible . Party rules say that to force out the leader, a vote of no-confidence has to be called – and the only way for that to happen is a card vote at the party’s annual conference. No such move was made at the last Labour conference six weeks ago in Manchester and none is scheduled before May’s election. So it seems that those dissatisfied with Ed Miliband’s leadership have missed their chance to force him out. Their only hope is that the pressure becomes so intolerable that he decides to step down for the good of the party. This could happen if, for example, a large number of MPs say publicly they want him to go. In that case, other candidates would be able to put themselves forward. To become a candidate, an MP needs the support of 15 per cent of the parliamentary party – or 39 of Labour’s current 257 MPs. The voting rules in a leadership contest were changed in March to a one member, one vote system for MPs, MEPs, party members and affiliated union members.","None of Ed Miliband's potential rivals have declared their hand .

"New images have emerged appearing to show the injuries a reality TV star has accused a tech tycoon of inflicting on her after she spent a weekend with him at the Sundance Film Festival. Ariane Bellamar, known as one of the high-maintenance moms on now-cancelled reality show Beverly Hills Nannies, told Radar Online that Patrick Henry, the 51-year-old CEO of Entropic Communications, beat her up in a drunken fight following the festival in Park City, Utah. The new images appear to show Bellamar with heavy bruising to her arms, legs and buttocks, and cuts to her left hand and lower back. Allegations: Beverly Hills Nannies star Ariane Bellamar (left) is accusing tech tycoon Patrick Henry (right) of beating her up in a drunken fight after taking her to the Sundance Film Festival as his date . The new images appear to show Bellamar with heavy bruising to her upper arms and cuts on her left hand . The reality TV star also appears to have suffered bruising to her left kneecap following the alleged attack . Bellamar says she met Henry after separating . from real estate mogul Barry Pettitt in November. She entered the online . dating pool and connected with the executive on MillionaireMatch.com. When he asked her to be his date to Sundance, she agreed because 'he seemed normal' and mutual friends vouched for him. She seemed to be having a great time when she posted a picture of the view from Utah on January 22. 'Park City is amazing!' she wrote. But things allegedly took a turn on their second night out. 'He . started doing shots...and became very jealous of the attention his . friends were paying me,' Bellamar told Radar. 'I told him I wanted to . leave [but] he did not. I took a cab back to the cabin, inadvertently . locked the door behind me and went to bed.' The photographs appear to show cuts and heavy bruising to Bellamar's legs, buttocks and lower back . Happy start: On January 22, Bellamar posted a picture from Park City on her Facebook page. She says she agreed to go to the film festival with Henry even though she never met him in person . Took a turn: But just four days later she posted a more ominous message on her Facebook . Looking for love: Bellamar says she met Henry on dating site MillionaireMatch.com, and that the two had not met in person before she agreed to be his date to Sundance . The . next thing she says she remembers is being woken up by Henry, dragging her by . the hair into the garage. She claims he screamed at her and accused her of . purposefully locking him out even though he had a key. 'He then proceeded to throw me multiple times into the concrete walls of the garage,' she said. 'I am bloodied and bruised all up and down my left side of my body and… right side. It was terrifying.' Bellamar provided pictures of her injuries to Radar which show bruises covering her left arm, thigh and backside with scabs on her hands and broken nails. 'After three tosses, I just laid . freezing on the garage floor, begging him to allow me into the house ,' Bellamar said. 'I thought that I was going to freeze to death. I was . still in my cocktail attire from the evening. He looked crazy.' 'As . I was laying bloody on his garage floor, I thought “Oh my God, I’m . going to die here.” This is what you see on TV. I am not that person,' she added to MailOnline. Star: Bellamar became famous for being one of the high-maintenance moms on now-cancelled reality show Beverly Hills Nannies . Split: Bellamar told MailOnline that she and husband Barry Pettitt have been separated since November. Pictured above with daughter Emma . Eventually Henry agreed to let her back in, and Bellamar says she then went to sit on the couch where she started crying, curled up in the fetal position. Henry yelled at her to stop crying, picking her up and throwing her back into bed. Bellamar continued to cry and shake 'uncontrollably', prompting Henry to rip off the covers and tell her to leave. Bellamar says she was in so much pain and shock, she didn't even respond so Henry called the police saying she wouldn't leave. She said the experience has been 'traumatizing' and . that she cannot understand the domestic abuse 'as a woman or as a mother'. Abused: After returning from Utah, Bellamar went to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a 'stress reaction to a recent assault' Four days after posting the picture from Henry's Park City home, she wrote a somber status on Facebook. 'Brutality against women never goes unpunished - never. You can run and/or try to hide, but it will catch up with you - always ... xo Peace Over Violence.' Back in her home of Santa Barbara, Bellamar went to the hospital where discharge records show she was diagnosed with a 'stress reation to a recent assault' and that she suffered 'multiple strain, contusions and abrasions' including hand and shoulder sprains. MailOnline's calls to the Summit County Sheriff's office were not immediately returned Tuesday afternoon, but Captain Justin Martinez told Radar that they were investigating the allegations but that no charges have been pressed. Why? Bellamar told Radar she's having a hard time understanding the attack 'as a woman or as a mother'. Pictured with daughter Emma above. After receiving requests for comment from Radar, Henry sent Bellamar two threatening text messages. First he wrote: 'I got an email from RadarOnline about the incident at my home in Utah last week. I plan to ignore the inquiry. If you want to discuss, please let me know. As far as I'm concerned it is private. Let me know your thoughts. I can forward the email if you want.' A few hours later, he sent yet another text: 'Keep in mind if you publicly disparage me, I will reveal the facts of the situation in defense of myself.' MailOnline reached out to Henry's company for comment, but has not received a reply. Following the attack, Bellamar is having trouble sleeping at night and has started seeing a therapist. She says her husband has been 'extraordinarily supportive' despite their separation. Another challenge is explaining her injuries to her 5-year-old daughter. 'I . tell her you’ve got to be careful about who you’re around and not to talk . to strangers. At my age, I should have listened to my own advice,' she said.

"The State of Kansas has approved a massive sex toy auction to recoup more than $100,000 dollars in unpaid taxes from a failed chain of sex shops. Vibrators, handcuffs,lingerie, paddles, ropes, restraints and porn DVDs will be sold off by the boxload Monday in a bid to claw back $163,986 from United Outlets LLC, which operated five erotic stores in Kansas and Missouri. The sex chain - which traded under the name Bang - owes state authorities for unpaid sales, income and withholding taxes. The State of Kansas approved a huge sex toy auction, featuring more than 1,250 items, in the hope of raising $163,986 in unpaid tax money. Lots include this 12-inch, leather bound paddle (left), an erotic whip (center) and a beginners S&M kit (right) Failure to perform: The items were seized by state revenue officers from a chain of five sex stores trading under the name Bang in and around Kansas City . When all other tactics failed to produce the money, Kansas revenue officials raided the business in July, seizing huge amounts of erotic stock from the stores. The state then struck a deal with business owner Larry Minkoff, who was allowed to set up the auction to amass funds to start paying his debt, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal. Auction site equip-bid.com is hosting the auction, which will take place on Monday in the West Bottoms region of Kansas City, just past the state line with Missouri. As well as hosting the huge haul online, potential buyers will be invited to inspect the goods in person on Monday. 'New and unopened': Some of the equipment on sale is wearable - such as these pouch-style briefs for men(left) and (right) a three-part set of wrist restraints, ankle restraints and a face mask for women (photos posed by models) Convoluted: This four-way set of handcuffs also featured in the auction, which mingled individual items with massive boxloads of sex equipment . In a message on the site, the auctioneers said: 'There are literally thousands of new items. Adult toys, lingerie, DVDs - you name it. All items are new in their original packaging.' The auction features more than 1,250 sex-themed lots - a mixture of individual items and whole boxes of erotic equipment. A lot of around 100 vibrators and other sex paraphernalia had been given offers of $70. One box of 404 explicit DVDs was selling for $45, while an electric shock kit was under offer for $53. Opposition politicians in Kansas have accused the Republican administration of dragging the state into 'the porn business' to balance its books. Themed: There was plenty of Fifty Shades of Grey-themed merchandise on offer, including copies of the bestselling novels - as well as equipment with a more direct application . The Kansas Senate Democratic leader, Anthony Hensley, launched the attack on Governor Sam Brownback when the auction came to light. He said: 'Brownback is so desperate to fill the massive hole in the state budget caused by his reckless income tax cuts that the state of Kansas is now in the porn business. A spokesman for Brownback defended the sale as standard practice. She said: 'While we do not agree with the type of business involved here, it was nonetheless a legal business that was closed due to failure to pay taxes. 'The state cannot legally destroy the property. Returning the property to the owner would have rewarded the business that violated state tax law. This is the same process used by previous administrations.'","State of Kansas seized sex goods from stores around Kansas City in July .

"The Deputy Prime Minister said the Coalition policy was a crucial step to ensure mental health problems were treated as seriously as physical ones . Peoplewith mental illness should feel as comfortable talking about it as they do talking about a sprained ankle, Nick Clegg will say today. From April, patients who need counselling will be guaranteed it within a time limit of 18 weeks, the same as for surgical procedures, he will announce. The Deputy Prime Minister said the Coalition policy was a crucial step to ensure mental health problems were treated as seriously as physical ones. Another £120million will be put into improving treatment provision on the health service in England, for which there are no currently time limits. Under the plans, someone experiencing psychosis for the first time – which includes schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression – would be referred for treatment within two weeks, the same as for cancer treatment. At least one in four people experience a mental health problem during their lives, which costs the economy about £100 billion a year in lost productivity and hospital admissions. Mr Clegg will say: ‘While I have nothing but praise for the tremendous work of NHS staff, the system is still letting patients down. ‘It’s wrong that relatives and friends needing a hip operation can expect treatment within a clear timeframe but someone with a debilitating mental health condition has no clarity about when they will get help.’ Scroll down for video . Mr Clegg is also making mental health treatment a priority for his own party. In his conference speech today, he will slam the ‘Cinderella’ treatment of conditions such as eating disorders, depression and self-harm. Former heavyweight boxing champion Frank Bruno revealed he had been sectioned twice in the past 18 months because of mental health problems . ‘I want this to be a country where a young dad chatting at the school gates will feel as comfortable discussing anxiety, stress, depression as the mum who’s explaining how she sprained her ankle’, he will say. In a video shown at the conference in Glasgow yesterday, former heavyweight boxing champion Frank Bruno revealed he had been sectioned twice in the past 18 months because of mental health problems. He said: ‘My name is Frank Bruno and I’m talking from experience of being sectioned about three times – two times in the last 18 months. ‘I’m just a nobody really, I’m just a human being. Yesterday I used to do boxing and I used to be a celebrity, but I’m talking to you as a human being from experience.’ Mr Bruno recorded the video to introduce a speech by Health Minister Norman Lamb, who told the conference: ‘Frank Bruno came to talk to me about his experience. ‘He talked about the acute embarrassment and humiliation of three marked police cars arriving at his house – as if a dreadful crime had been committed. But he was ill. ‘And so many people end up completely inappropriately in police cells. It is an outrage. Just imagine being very ill. 'Perhaps in a state of enormous anxiety. And then you are locked up in a cell. It’s inhuman.’ Simon Stevens, NHS England’s chief executive, said yesterday’s announcement on waiting times was an ‘important moment’ and the extra money would ‘bring parity of esteem for mental health services a step closer.’ If his party gets into power, Mr Clegg has promised to put another £1billion per year into the NHS budget in real terms, by scrapping some tax breaks.","Deputy PM says mental health problems should be treated as seriously as physical ones .

"Model Denise Bidot, 28, is changing the face of fashion, one runway show at a time. The size-14 beauty, who grew up in Miami and now lives in New York City, recently graced New York City Fashion Week catwalks for Chromat and Serena Williams Signature Statement Collection - both of which are not historically 'plus-size' brands. 'The reaction from the Serena Williams runway show was breathtaking,' she told MailOnline. 'And having everyone clap when I came out was surreal.' Beautiful! Size-14 model Denise Bidot opened the Chromat runway show during New York Fashion Week earlier this month . Urban chic! Ms Bidot was the only fuller-figured model to walk in Serena Williams' runway show, which was attended by Anna Wintour. She received applause after her walk . Miss Bidot, who is Puerto Rican/Kuwaiti, was the only fuller-figured model in the Serena Williams show. Attendees for the show included Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, actor Marlon Wayans, and tennis player Caroline Wozniacki. 'I never expected to have the leading lady of fashion clap for me and support my presence at the show,' she said. 'It was an experience I will never forget. I felt the love from the moment I walked in from Serena and her team.' In the show, Ms Bidot wore a slim-fitting, above-the-knee black dress with an asymmetrical zipper and mesh three-quarter-length sleeves. At Chromat, the brand known for dressing Beyonce for her performance at the Super Bowl last year, Miss Bidot's curves were flaunted and flattered even more as she opened the show. She walked in a risque, cage-style ensemble with a cropped, strapless, corset-like top. Her hair was pulled into a tight bun with a braid coming down the side. Following both shows, fans immediately started posting to social media to show support for Miss Bidot. Twitter user ‏@NYCDR3AMZ wrote: 'Thanks for making plus size women feel more confident in themselves that they CAN walk that walk and talk that talk.' Another woman, @Khristina2334 said: 'Thank you for breaking barriers, and representing women of all sizes! One of my fav.moments!!' After New York Fashion Week, Miss Bidot was flown to the U.K. for the Evan show at London Fashion Week. Besides being a runway model, Miss Bidot has also starred in campaigns for Forever21, Macy's, Nordstrom and Old Navy. She is currently the face of Zizzi, a Danish clothing line for women with curves. Stunning! Miss Bidot, who's 28, grew up in Miami before moving to Los Angeles to pursue acting . Size is just a number! Ms Bidot was doing someone else's makeup during a fashion shoot when a photographer spotted her and asked if she'd be interested in pursuing modeling herself . Miss Bidot's entrance into modeling came rather late by industry standards - and she initially thought she wanted to be a actress (an aspiration she is still pursuing). When she turned 18, she moved from Miami to Los Angeles - but was turned down by so many casting directors that she decided she needed a backup plan, according to the bio on her website. She enrolled in courses to learn how to be a makeup artist. One day, while she was doing makeup for a shoot, a photographer asked her if she'd ever considered modeling herself. The photographer took pictures of Miss Bidot and posted them to a well-known modeling bulletin board, where they got hundreds of responses. She was then pursued by clients who wanted her to model for their brand, and also got picked up by a modeling agency, Muse Models based in New York. Miss Bidot is happy that she inspires so many women - and hopes that her shape doesn't remain an anomaly in an industry typically marked by rail-thin women. 'Honestly, I have always been a confident person and true to who I am,' she said. 'My amazing mother and grandparents raised me to fall in love with me and accept myself as no one else will. If you share that confident energy with those around you then everyone else will catch on.'","The 28-year-old is the first plus-size Latina model to walk in two 'straight-size' runway shows at New York Fashion Week .

"An otherwise dull congressional hearing heated up briefly on Friday, as a Florida congressman told the top Health and Human Services 'preparedness' official she should quit, before ranting about the chance of contracting Ebola from a dirty airplane – and then abruptly leaving to catch a flight. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee heard testimony from a panel that included HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Nicole Lurie, two Pentagon officials and the Homeland Security Department's inspector general. Lurie gamely kept a straight face. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Yeah, the plane! They've been on the plane,' snapped Rep. John Mica. 'They might have barfed on the plane!' Dr. Nicole Lurie, the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, sat puzzled while the congressman leapt from topic to topic and wondered aloud about who's in charge . 'These people are coming by planes,' said GOP Rep. John Mica of Pennsylvania. 'When some plane comes in from Africa, or transits through and has passengers from there, what are we doing with it? The plane?' 'With the plane itself?' a puzzled Lurie asked. 'Yeah, the plane! They've been on the plane,' snapped Mica. 'They might have barfed on the plane, there might be excrement, there may be vomit, there may be body fluids.' 'There are protocols for cleaning the plane,' offered Lurie. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention insists that Ebola is transmitted only through contact with bodily fluids. In some cases, however, the deadly contagion can remain alive on inert surfaces for a period of minutes. Mica explained that his concerns stemmed from a global avian influenza crisis nearly a decade ago. 'I want to know the protocols are there in place! I've seen the equipment that we have, and the Centers for Disease Control actually got some of them,' he told Lurie. 'It's a heating device that heats the plane to 140 degrees to kill the germs, and that's what we used in the bird flu. Are we doing anything like that to make sure those planes aren't little Ebola transporters?' After a brief pause, Lurie shifted gears. 'Mr. Mica, you sound upset, and I'm sorry for that,' she said. 'But we will make sure you get the protocols for cleaning the plane.' 'I'm not upset!' Mica insisted. 'I'm a happy boy.' Forget about screening the passengers: what about the planes? Mica flipped out at the idea that the Ebola virus could hop from a person to an airplane or lavatory seat and then onto another passenger . Lurie had told the committee in her opening statement that 'Ebola is a dangerous disease, but there is hardly a reason for panic. There is an epidemic of fear, but not of Ebola, in the United States.' '""This isn't a panic. It's to be prepared"",' Mica parroted back to her. Tom Lehrer, 1959 . When Pennsylvania Republican Rep. John Mica referred to 'Be Prepared' as 'The Boy Scout's marching song,' his unique choice of words pointed to a 1953 song by humorist Tom Lehrer (video below) about how a scout can fulfill his motto by carrying condoms and hiding his marijuana stash: . Keep those reefers hidden where you're sure that they will not be found / And be careful not to smoke them when the scoutmaster's around, . For he only will insist that they be shared. Be prepared! --- . If you're looking for adventure of a new and different kind / And you come across a Girl Scout who is similarly inclined, . Don't be nervous, don't be flustered, don't be scared. Be prepared! Grabbing a copy of a Homeland Security inspector general report that found stockpiles of equipment and medicines that could be helpful in fighting Ebola had been allowed to expire or fall into disrepair, he fixed his gaze on Lurie. 'Now, are you in charge of being prepared?' he asked. 'I am in charge of being prepared,' Lurie repied. 'Okay, then I think you need to turn your resignation in. Have you read this report? Have you read this report about preparedness that the IG – do you have some authority over preparedness?' Lurie told him that as an HHS official, she has no authority to oversee disease preparedness measures undertaken by another cabinet agency. 'Then you don't have the authority to do the job?' a near-manic Mica sputtered. 'Who has the authority to do the job? ... Is that your job or somebody else's?' 'You told me you're responsible for preparedness,' he shouted minutes later. 'Now if that's not your responsibility, is it the new guy's?' Mica was referring to White House Ebola Response Coordinator Ronald Klain, and made his point with a colorful reference to a 1950s song by humorist Tom Lehrer about a Boy Scout packing condoms and hiding his marijuana. 'Does he have the ability to go in and make certain that we are prepared? It hasn't hit here yet. But what you want to do is be prepared' – '""the Boy Scout's marching song, Be Prepared"",' he said. Lurie  managed to crack only a single momentary smile. As he finished his interrogation, Mica got up to leave while the hearing continued. 'I have a plane to catch,' a room microphone picked him up saying. 'Have a safe flight,' offered committee chair Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican. 'It'll be about your twelfth in four days.'","A rambling Florida Rep. John Mica ripped into HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Nicole Lurie during an Ebola hearing .

"Painted by the greatest ever artist, it is the world’s most famous picture, with the most famous smile. The painting has been imitated a thousand times, satirised, stolen and vandalised with acid, red paint, stones and even a teacup. And now, it seems, there might be a second Mona Lisa — a bigger Mona, with a less enigmatic, slightly jollier smile, and a pair of new classical columns on either side of her mysterious, beguiling face. On Friday in Geneva, the Isleworth Mona Lisa is to be revealed by its owners — a Swiss consortium, who argue that their version is Leonardo’s first stab at the painting; and that the famous version, held in the Louvre in Paris, was his second bite of the cherry. Anatoly Karpov, the chess grandmaster and member of the Mona Lisa Foundation, will unveil the painting. In comparison: The real Mona Lisa, Leonardo's enigmatic masterpiece, is seen (left); while the Isleworth Mona Lisa, a younger likeness between two pillars, is also shown (right) Opinion within the art world is split over whether it is a real Leonardo or a later copy, painted in the late 16th century, long after the original was executed, between 1503 and 1519. Among those backing the theory that it is genuine are Alessandro Vezzosi, director of the Museo Ideale Leonardo da Vinci in Vinci, the artist’s birthplace on the edge of Florence. On Friday, he will present the reasons for his conclusion, alongside Carlo Pedretti, of the University of California. A spokesman for the Mona Lisa Foundation has promised that, on Friday, the foundation will produce ‘historical, comparative and scientific evidence’ that the painting ‘was indeed executed by Leonardo’. Not everyone is so convinced. ‘I would have to be deeply sceptical,’ says Philip Mould, the portrait expert, Antiques Roadshow presenter and host of Fake Or Fortune? ‘It would be an extraordinary find, the ultimate prize. Leonardo did do variants [different versions of the same picture], like his Madonna Of The Rocks in last year’s National Gallery show. So it wouldn’t be unheard of for him to do another Mona Lisa. ‘Still, you must remember that about one new supposed Mona Lisa turns up on the market every year. You’d have to look at the provenance and history of this one very, very carefully.’ The known history of this second Mona goes back to 1914, when it was bought by a critic and artist called Hugh Blaker, from Isleworth, West London — hence the name. World famous: The painting by Leonardo da Vinci, pictured, has been imitated a thousand times, satirised, stolen and vandalised with acid, red paint, stones and even a teacup . Blaker bought the picture from a grand collection in Somerset, where it had apparently hung on the walls for a century. In 1962, an American art collector, Henry F. Pulitzer, bought the painting and devoted much of his life to proving it was an original. He even wrote a book backing his claim, Where Is The Mona Lisa?, published by the Pulitzer Press, his own company. 'I would have to be deeply sceptical. It would be an extraordinary find, the ultimate prize' Philip Mould, portrait expert . Pulitzer — and other defenders of the Isleworth Mona Lisa — depend for their attribution on Leonardo’s 16th-century biographer, Giorgio Vasari, himself a painter. Vasari said that Leonardo started the Mona Lisa in 1503 and ‘left it unfinished’. But then, in 1517, said Vasari, a completed picture of a ‘certain Florentine lady’ popped up in Leonardo’s collection. This picture is the Louvre version, while the unfinished earlier version was the Isleworth Leonardo, or so the theory goes. That order of events would explain why the Isleworth Mona Lisa looks younger than the famous version — because it was, theoretically, painted years before the famous version. Pulitzer also depended for his theory on Raphael, the painter and contemporary of Da Vinci, who sketched a version of the Mona Lisa in 1504. His sketch included the columns that are found in the Isleworth version. The final big piece in the jigsaw, said Pulitzer, was a 1584 art history book, Trattato dell’arte della Pittura  Scultura ed Architettura, by Giovanni Lomazzo, which refers to ‘della Gioconda, e di Mona Lisa’ — ‘the Gioconda, and the Mona Lisa’ — suggesting there were two pictures. Admiration: Art fans look at the Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci, left, in the Louvre museum in Paris . The Gioconda is an alternative title for the Mona Lisa; Mona is an abbreviation of ‘Ma donna’, or My Lady, while Gioconda is Italian for the jocund, or happy, one. The sitter’s real name is in fact thought to be Lisa Gherardini, wife of a rich Florence silk merchant, Francesco del Giocondo. On Leonardo’s death in 1519, the picture — the Louvre’s version, that is! — was left to his assistant, Salai, who in turn sold it to King Francis I of France. The painting remained in the royal  collection until the French Revolution in 1789, when it was moved to the Louvre. There it has remained ever since, with a few notable absences. Napoleon kept it in his bedroom in the Tuileries Palace and, during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1, it was transferred for safekeeping to the Arsenal in Brest. During World War II, it migrated all over France to avoid damage. It has also been on tour to New York and Washington, Tokyo and Moscow. But the picture’s biggest excursion was in 1911, when it was stolen by an Italian Louvre worker, called Vincenzo Peruggia, who wanted it returned  to Italy. He pulled off the biggest art theft in history in the simplest way: hiding in a broom cupboard during the day, then slipping out after closing time, the Mona Lisa stuffed under his coat. He kept it in his flat for two years and was only discovered when he brazenly tried to flog the picture to the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Extraordinary skill: Leonardo's exceptional Lady With An Ermine was painted in around 1490, nearly 15 years before the Louvre's Mona Lisa; and already it displays Leonardo's supreme talent . That wasn’t the end of Mona Lisa’s troubles. In 1956, the poor old girl was first scarred with acid, and then attacked with a rock. Bulletproof glass protected it when, in 1974, a disabled woman, protesting against the Louvre’s policy on handicapped visitors, threw red paint at the picture. The glass again saved the picture only three years ago, when an angry Russian woman, denied French  citizenship, threw a teacup at the painting. Meanwhile, the other supposed Mona Lisa gathered dust in a Swiss bank vault, where it has rested for 40 years. After Pulitzer’s death, he left the picture to his girlfriend and, on her death, the Swiss consortium bought it. 'She might look younger, but this is probably because the copyist — and I believe it is a copy done a few years after the Mona Lisa — just painted it that way' Martin Kemp, Oxford University . This Friday, the art world will examine it in the flesh for the first time since Pulitzer briefly exhibited it in an American show half-a-century ago. Many art historians remain doubtful. ‘So much is wrong,’ says the Leonardo expert and emeritus professor of art at Oxford University, Martin Kemp. ‘The dress, the hair and background landscape. This one is also painted on canvas, which Leonardo rarely did.’ The famous Mona Lisa is painted on wood, as are practically all of his paintings. ‘She might look younger,’ says Professor Kemp, ‘but this is probably because the copyist — and I believe it is a copy done a few years after the Mona Lisa — just painted it that way.’ The theory used to go that, because the Isleworth picture was done earlier in Leonardo’s career, he had not matured in style when he painted it. That theory was blown out of the water last year at the National Gallery exhibition, when his exceptional Lady With An Ermine was shown. That picture was painted in around 1490, nearly 15 years before the Louvre’s Mona Lisa; and already it displays Leonardo’s supreme talent. ‘That show confirmed his extraordinary skill in the way he expressed skin and modelling,’ says Philip Mould. ‘You’d have to have a dispassionate look at the technique in the Isleworth picture, and do lots of forensics. But still, nothing is impossible.’ And so the art world will wait with bated breath until Thursday, when the door of that Swiss bank vault creaks open, to see if lightning really did strike twice for the world’s greatest artist.","Isleworth Mona Lisa to be revealed by its owners on Friday in Geneva .

"Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal has dismissed 'Chinese Restaurant Syndrome' as being nothing more than an 'old wives' tale'. At the Cheltenham Literature Festival, the three Michelin-starred chef told an audience that the controversial additive is perfectly safe. Chinese Restaurant Syndrome describes a group of symptoms that some people experience after eating food from a Chinese restaurant, such as sweating and chest pains. Heston Blumenthal, owner of the Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, said the suggestion that food additive monosodium glutamate (MSG) is bad for you is 'complete and utter nonsense' A food additive called monosodium glutamate (MSG) is often blamed for Chinese restaurant syndrome, but the acclaimed chef dismissed that suggestion. He said: 'The biggest old wives tail is that MSG is bad for you. That is complete and utter nonsense. 'There is not one (scientific) paper to prove that. These beliefs come from the 1970s when some journalist wrote about it. 'With salt there is a 50/50 argument but there is no argument with MSG,' adding that glutamate is actually 'a really important element of taste.' The chef has dismissed 'Chinese Restaurant Syndrome' as being nothing more than an 'old wives' tale' Chinese restaurant syndrome describes a group of symptoms that some people experience after eating food from a Chinese restaurant. A food additive called monosodium glutamate (MSG) is often blamed for Chinese restaurant syndrome, but scientific evidence has not proven MSG to be the cause of the symptoms. MSG is a food additive that is used as a flavour enhancer to make foods taste better. MSG is similar to glutamate, a substance that is found naturally in almost all foods . Symptoms of Chinese restaurant syndrome usually begin within two hours after eating foods that contain MSG. They can last anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days. Common symptoms include headaches, sweating, skin flushing, numbness, burning in the mouth and fatigue. The celebrity chef went on to discuss his latest book, Historic Heston. He regaled tales from his research into our culinary heritage, talking about a recipe he discovered in the Georgian period in which they used to roast a chicken and then reportedly 'bring it back to life'. It was plucked while it was alive, basted and then rocked to sleep before causing chaos at the dining table. Another tale of the period involved a midget being placed in a pie – but unlike the chicken he survived. Heston also told his audience that 'this was probably the greatest period in British cooking ever.' 'The last great period in Britain for gastronomy was the Georgian period in the mid 1700s,' he said, 'they were fairly advanced in some of the food they made. 'What happened after that, and the reason our culinary heritage took a nose dive, was land reclamation when all the free land you could graze and grow food on was taken away,. 'People were forced to live in cities. The Industrial Revolution arrived and then we embraced everything French. Mrs Beeton and all that were very French cooking. ' As for the future, the chef predicted that flavour perception is 'going to be a big thing' in the next five to 10 years. 'I can feel it in my waters,' he said. 'We are only scratching the surface.'","The celebrity chef said Chinese restaurant syndrome is an 'old wives' tale'

"Dozens more women and girls have been abducted by Nigerian terror group Boko Haram a day after an apparent ceasefire was announced, it was reported today. Nigeria's military and president last week raised hopes that 200 schoolgirls snatched by the Islamic militants in April would be returned as a result of the truce. But fighting has continued and there is still no word as yet on the whereabouts of the teenagers. Some of the 200 Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram are seen in a video released by the terror group earlier this year. A deal has reportedly been reached to secure the release in a ceasefire agreement, but fighting has continued and the militants have reportedly captured dozens more women and girls . The extremists attacked three north-eastern towns on Saturday and raised their flag in a fourth village, rounding up women and girls, according to locals. People who escaped this week from Bama, a town in a part of northeastern Nigeria where Boko Haram has declared an Islamic caliphate, say hundreds of residents are being detained for allegedly breaking the group's strict version of Sharia law. Residents who got out of Bama said so many people have been detained by Boko Haram that the local jail is overcrowded and houses are being used as makeshift prisons. Many young men have been forced to join Boko Haram, and those who refuse are killed, said those who ran away. People are jailed after brief 'trials' for infringements like smoking cigarettes, said Amina Bukar, a middle-aged woman who said she hiked through the bush for five days before reaching Maiduguri, the Borno state capital 75 kilometers (nearly 50 miles) away. Food is running short since shops have been looted by Boko Haram, said Bukar. 'Water also is very scarce, sometimes you line up (at the communal tap) for 24 hours,' she said. In a separate attack, a bomb exploded at a bus station in northern Nigeria's Bauchi state late on Wednesday, killing at least five people and wounding 12, police said. The leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, has been demanding the release of detained extremists in exchange for the girls since they were captured from a boarding school in May . The blast is likely to be blamed on Boko Haram, but not one has yet claimed responsibility. Officials had said talks with Nigeria's rebels would resume in neighbouring Chad this week, but there is still no confirmation that negotiations have resumed. The official silence raises many questions, especially since Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau has not confirmed that a truce has been agreed. Relatives of the girls abducted from a boarding school in northeastern Chibok town said they are confused but trying to be hopeful. 'Things are still sketchy with lots of holes and varying statements,' said Allen Manasseh, a brother of one of the missing schoolgirls. Manasseh said he relentlessly scours the news headlines to find out when his sister, Maryam, may return home. Dozens of activists continue a daily protest at Unity Fountain in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, using the hashtag BringBackOurGirls to demand that the government and military ensure the release of kidnapped students . Nigeria's Foreign Minister Aminu Wali on Tuesday said 'I can say with some optimism, cautious optimism, that were are moving toward a situation where we'd be able to, in the very near future, to be able to get back our girls.' Wali spoke at a news conference in Berlin of 'the possibility of having total cessation of hostilities.' In Nigeria's capital, Abuja, dozens of activists continue a daily protest ritual at Unity Fountain, using the hashtag (hash)BringBackOurGirls to demand that the government and military ensure the release of the students. Campaigner Aisha Yesufu said they had been told the girls would be freed on Monday, but it didn't happen. 'The government spokesperson came out and said that they never said Monday, that they are saying this week. We are still watching. We are extremely anxious,' she told the AP. Some 276 girls and young women writing science examinations were kidnapped from a government boarding school in Chibok in the early hours of April 15. Dozens escaped by themselves in the first couple of days but some 219 remain missing. Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands forced from their homes in the 5-year uprising to establish an Islamic state in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation of some 160 million people divided almost equally between Muslims and Christians.","Terror group rounded up captives after storming three towns and a village .

"Ed Miliband will pledge to lower the voting age to 16, following the trial of the idea in the Scottish referendum. The Labour leader, who has long been a supporter of an earlier voting age, is expected to use a speech at next week’s party conference to pledge that the policy will be included in his general election manifesto. Such a move – the first change in the voting age since 1969 – would enfranchise more than 1.5million 16 and 17-year-olds. Party sources believe that idealistic youngsters are more likely to vote Labour. The idea is also backed by the Liberal Democrats. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband will pledge to lower the voting age to 16, following the trial of the idea in the Scottish referendum . But polls show that the public, including most 16-year-olds, do not support the idea. It is also opposed by the Conservatives. A Labour source last night said that the policy’s place in the manifesto was ‘set in concrete’. Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan said: ‘Despite warnings from the sceptics, 16- and 17-year-olds did come out and vote and engage in the big issues over the future of Scotland. ‘This is all the more reason why the voting age should be lowered for all elections as it is an idea whose time has come. ‘Labour has been calling for a lowering of the voting age for some time, and after the referendum there’s little reason why it shouldn’t be full steam ahead for all elections.’ Shadow Cabinet minister Jim Murphy, a leading figure in the No campaign in Scotland, said that Labour should now press for a change in the law in time for next year’s election. Mr Murphy said the experiment in Scotland had ‘blown out of the water’ the idea that 16-year-olds were not engaged enough with politics to be trusted with the vote. ‘They have been so engaged, so switched on,’ he said. ‘If there’s still time for the next election, let’s give 16- and 17-year-olds the vote. Otherwise, you’re going to have 16-year-old Scots, who have voted today in the biggest decision that will ever be taken, having to sit out and watch.’ The voting age in Britain was reduced from 21 to 18 in 1969. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps dismissed calls to lower the voting age to 16 when the issue was raised last year. Mr Shapps warned the move would ‘politicise the classroom, with votes for youngsters who are still at school’. He also accused Labour of bowing to the demands of its union paymasters over the issue. Last year Unite, which is Labour’s biggest donor, demanded that 16-year-olds should be given the vote. The union, run by Len McCluskey, said: ‘Young people should be given a stake in the political process by lowering the voting age to 16.’ An exit poll of just over 2,000 Scottish voters by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft showed that the 16 and 17-year-olds enfranchised for the first time by the Scottish referendum were overwhelmingly in favour of independence. The small sample – which may not have been representative of teenagers overall – showed that 71 per cent of the age group voted Yes. In contrast, only 27 per cent of over-65s voted in favour of independence in Lord Ashcroft’s sample. The figures suggest that school pupils are indeed more likely to vote for radical options placed in front of them. But this did not carry through to the next age group – the split between Yes and No for 18- to 24-year-olds was virtually even in the exit poll.","Miliband expected to pledge to lower voting age to 16 in conference speech .

"Six police officers are facing misconduct charges after a detective’s teenage daughter was murdered by a sex fiend - five years after he carried out an almost identical attack.

But at his trial it emerged he was investigated for a similar attack on another girl aged 17 in 2008. He tried to strangle the girl after asking her to his home, where he promised to take pictures of her. The girl managed to escape and complained to police. Reynolds was given a ‘final warning’ and counselling. Two weeks later, Reynolds’s stepfather contacted the police and handed in indecent images of women onto which his stepson had superimposed nooses, but no action was taken.

There is no suggestion they are the two people in this photograph . ‘We are disappointed in the lack of a statement and detail from Devon and Cornwall Police and for not being open and honest with us and the public as they said they would be from the beginning of the inquiry.’ Speaking earlier this year, she said: ‘In 2008, Reynolds mirrored an attack basically that he committed on Georgia in that, he lured a girl round on the pretext of helping him out with a project and then there was a violent attack where he attempted to strangle her. ‘Thankfully she managed to escape, but it has traumatised her and it has totally changed her life. As parents, we feel that had it been investigated properly, we wouldn’t be in this situation.’ Devon and Cornwall Police today confirmed that misconduct notices had been issued to the officers. A force spokesman said: ‘Six serving police officers have been served with misconduct notices in relation to this ongoing investigation. The officers concerned have not been suspended at this time.’ Next month Reynolds is expected to appeal his full life sentence when the case is heard at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London. 2008: Jamie Reynolds, then 17, is reported to police after luring a girl back to his house with an offer of a photo shoot before trying to strangle her. He is let off with a caution. Later, Reynolds' stepfather goes to the police with pictures from the boy's hard drive. They feature girls with nooses superimposed around their necks and pornographic images of a man raping and strangling a girl to death. No action is taken. Sunday May 26, 2013: Georgia is last seen by her parents at 7.30pm as she leaves the family home in Wellington, Shropshire. She tells them she is going to stay with friends. In fact she went to Reynolds' home where he persuaded her to climb onto a box and place her head in a noose for a picture, before kicking the box away and hanging her. He then took several pictures of her dead body, both clothed and unclothed, before carrying out a sexual assault. Tuesday May 28: Georgia is reported missing by her parents after it emerges she has not stayed with friends. Police arrive in the morning to a semi-detached house in Avondale Road, Wellington, and, according to a neighbour, break down the door to get inside. Neighbours say a Jamie Reynolds lives at the address with his parents. Wednesday May 29: Reynolds is arrested in a budget hotel in Glasgow city centre by officers from Police Scotland on suspicion of kidnapping Georgia. They also seize a Toyota van which Reynolds used to transport Georgia's body to woodlands where he dumped it, before heading north. CCTV will later show he visited an Odeon cinema in Wrexham while her body was still inside. Thursday May 30: West Mercia Police say the suspect has been arrested on suspicion of murder following 'developments in the investigation'. They stress that Georgia has still not been found. Friday May 31: Police confirm it came to light yesterday that Georgia died at an address in Wellington, Telford. The body of a young female found in woodland on the Nant-y-Grath pass, in north Wales, is believed to be linked to Georgia's disappearance. It is later confirmed to be the teenager. Jamie Reynolds, 22, is charged with her murder. December 2: Reynolds pleads guilty to murder at Stafford Crown Court. Mr Justice Wilkie remands Reynolds in custody until December 19 pending further psychiatric reports. December 19: Reynolds is handed a full life sentence for Georgia's murder after the judge hears he had the potential to go on and become a serial killer. He is only the 50th person in British legal history to be given such a sentence. In court it emerges that Reynolds began hunting for clips of women being strangled six years before the attack. When he was arrested police found 16,800 images and 72 videos of extreme pornography on his computer. It is also revealed that he subscribed to the same 'snuff' website as Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins, featuring videos of murder pornography.

"Martin Hunt, 24, was jailed for 12 years after he filmed himself abusing a baby girl . A paedophile who filmed himself sexually abusing a baby girl was caught after new owners of his home found child pornography he left behind during the move. The new owners of his home were quick to tip off police when they re-decorated the home and found a disc hidden behind kitchen units at the Frinton, Essex, property. Martin Hunt, 24, was eventually tracked down when police happened to find indecent images at another paedophile's house in Kent and a trail of emails linking Hunt to the abuse. Judge Patricia Lynch QC jailed Hunt for 12 years and gave him an extended licence of eight years when he appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court, Essex. This means he could be recalled to prison if he offends again within 20 years of his release. He will serve at least nine years in prison before he is considered for parole. Judge Lynch described the abuse as appalling and horrendous. She said: 'You are a danger to young children. I hope this child never knows what happened to her.' The judge praised Detective Sergeant Katie Mead and the investigation for their efforts to track Hunt down. She said: 'I am impressed by their tenacious approach in this case. If it had not been for that, this man may never have been caught. 'The officer in the case and others involved should be commended.' Hunt was caught after police arrested a man in Kent in December, 2013, on suspicion of sexually abusing two young girls. Officers found an email from Hunt in which he admitted sexually abusing a girl of whom he had sent pictures. Police then arrested Hunt on February 7. During the sentencing at Chelmsford Crown Court (pictured), the court heard how Hunt was found with items in his possession which had appeared in the child pornography recording . They found indecent photographs on a memory card, a camera and an iPhone. Prosecutor Diane Pigot said: 'Among his possessions were a T-shirt and gold chains he was wearing in the images. There was clearly evidence of sharing of indecent images.' Ms Pigot said the owners of Hunt's former house found a disc containing indecent images during redecorating works. Hunt admitted 19 charges, including sexual assault and making, distributing and possessing indecent images.","Paedophile jailed for 12 years after he filmed his abuse of a baby girl .

"Snoopy, Indiana Jones and He-Man are just a few of the characters that have been turned into novelty cameras and showcased in a new book. Christopher D. Salyers has been collecting novelty cameras for more than a decade and along with friend Buzz Poole, he travels the world searching for some of the rarest models. Now, the pair, from New York, have released a coffee table book called 'Camera Crazy' which chronicles the history of novelty cameras. Quirky: The Snoopy-Matic camera was manufactured in Hong Kong for the Helm Toy Corp in 1980 . Masters of the Universe He-Man Camera manufactured in China for HG Toys in 1985 . Indiana Jones is another character used to market cameras. Pictured, Indiana Jones Werlisa Safari Camera . The book explains the rise of photography from the launch of Kodak's Brownie, the world's first simple, low-cost camera, which made photography accessible to the masses in 1900 . Snapshots soon became the most popular method of capturing memories and soon the variety of cameras available increased. The book celebrates the toy camera - once, quirky models marketed to children with cartoon characters which have since become niche collectors' items. These cameras, which offer soft focus and effects, became ubiquitous in the analogue age and remain popular today. In essays studying the role of 'marketing and hipster culture' in the popularity of these cameras, the authors also discuss the surge of enthusiasm for their 'special effects' - paralleled by the rise of apps like Instagram, which mimic the effect of analogue cameras. Christopher D. Salyers and Buzz Poole have been collecting cameras for 10 years and travel the world in search of rare models . In 'Camera Crazy', full-colour photographs by J. K. Putnam showcase the strangest examples, including retro analogues, custom pieces, new products from Japan as well as camera-themed objects and accessories. It features a model made of Lego and even a dog modelling a pair of sunglasses with a camera attached. Their book also includes interviews with the inventor of the Holga camera and those responsible for Lomography. They explain Game Boy and Batman-themed cameras, as well as cameras specifically made to photograph cats. The Voltron Star Shooter Camera,  manufactured in Macau for Impulse Ltd in 1985, masquerades as an ordinary camera . But fiddle a little and it transforms into a science fiction hero, making it actually a toy as well as a camera . The Game Boy Camera made in Japan for Nintendo in 1998, was the world's smallest digital camera at the time . A little girl frames her shot with the Mick-a-Matic, manufactured in USA for Child Guidance Products in 1971 . Buzz, 37, said: 'Novelty cameras are hugely popular, in part because a lot of them are instant cameras and they produce a unique type of photos. 'But partly it's just because people love Mickey Mouse or Heineken beer and want to get their hands on all the merchandise they can. 'A lot aren't expensive at all and even the most collectible go for a couple of hundred dollars.' Photographer J. K. Purnam said: 'Not only did I photograph hundreds of these cameras I also had the opportunity to shoot with them. 'For the most part these cameras shoot film, some shot formats that were tricky to get a hold of and have developed, but after a bit of trial and error and a few expired rolls I was able to get some pretty interesting shots.' The Airou Toy Digital Camera manufactured in China for Capcom . The Pokemon camera from 1999 gave each photo taken a special border featuring all 150 Pokemon . The Lego Digital Camera manufactured in China for Digital Blue in 2011 featured a built-in flash . Charlie Tuna Camera was manufactured in USA for StarKist in 1971 .

"A father stabbed his wife and children to death in their beds and stayed in the family home with their bodies for days before hanging himself, it was revealed today. Jitendra Lad, 49, is believed to have murdered  Daksha Lad, 44, and their daughters, Trisha, 19, and Nisha, 16, at their detached house in Clayton, Bradford, days after celebrating Diwali as a family. The motive for the killings remains a mystery and MailOnline understands that police have not yet found a suicide note in the house. West Yorkshire Police believe Mr Lad, a 'respectable' council worker and school association chairman, stabbed his family to death as they slept over the weekend. After several days in the family home alone he hanged himself in one of the empty four bedrooms on Monday. Scroll down for video . Investigation: Jitendra Lad, 49, centre,  is believed to have stabbed to death his wife Daksha, 44, centre right, and their two children, Trisha, 19, left, and Nisha, 16, right, before hanging himself days later . Police probe: West Yorkshire Police launched a murder investigation after the family was found dead at home in the Clayton area of Bradford (pictured) on Monday night . Investigation: Police forensic teams arrived at the house but they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths . In mourning: Tearful friends of the dead teenagers have for days gathered at the home today to pay their respects . Hours later a worried neighbour called the police because the Lads had not left the house since Friday, and officers broke in to find the dead bodies. Police said last night a post mortem examination performed on Mr confirmed  he died from 'by hanging' and  'the examination suggested Mr Lad died on Monday'. But the autopsies on his wife and daughters revealed their fatal stab wounds 'are thought to have been sustained at an earlier point during the weekend'. To friends and family the Lads were regarded as 'the nicest family in the world' and the father of the family was 'protective' of his 'very clever' daughters and he and his wife were inseparable. One family member said: 'We had just had a great time of celebration. It had been Diwali and everyone had been happy. It is so sad and we just don't know why this happened or if something was wrong.' Friends and neighbours were unaware of any problems in the family and had heard no arguments. Both parents had good jobs as clerical officers with the local council and were keen to climb the career ladder. Trisha was in her second year at Leeds University studying for a degree in biochemistry and Nisha was at sixth form. Suspect: Jitendra Lad, left, was named by police as the man that died in a house in Bradford along with his wife Daksha, right . Sisters: Nisha Lad (right) with older sister Trisha, who were both described as bubbly by friends today . Forensic officers are still scouring the house as detectives began researching the family for a motive to the horrific murder. Police said again today they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. The parents and Nisha were seen heading to work and school as normal at around 7.30am on Friday, saying their usual cheerful hello to the newspaper delivery man. However, police said the bodies 'may have been in the property for some time' and neighbours could not recall seeing the family over the weekend. Mr Lad and his wife married in Bradford 23 years ago. The Hindu couple worked at Bradford Council, Mr Lad in revenue and benefits while his wife was an administrator. Shop manager Niraj Patel, 49, a friend of Mr Lad, said he was stunned to be told he may have murdered his family. 'He was a very happy, easy-going chap, always a smile on his face,' he said. 'I'm totally shocked. You'd never believe he would have an ounce of violence in him.' Upset: Neighbours and friends of the family have been visiting the home, with some laying flowers . Tributes: Shocked and emotional Bradford residents arrive at the house to lay flowers in memory of the family . Upset: Neighbours said today there were no clues that a tragedy like this would engulf a 'lovely' family . Susan Hawkins, 34, a support worker, said: 'They were the nicest family in the world and the last family you would ever expect this to happen to. I used to see the mum in the playground when the kids were younger and she had a gorgeous smile, she was a real doting mum.' Mr Lad's parents were being supported by family at their home less than half a mile from the scene yesterday. A relative, who did not want to be named, said: 'They are very, very shocked. They don't know what exactly has happened, they are waiting for the police to tell them.' Neighbours at the family's previous address in Clayton, where they lived for 14 years, said the couple sold up to move to a better area and a better home. One said: 'You could call them aspirational. She wanted to be head of planning or something like that.' Jessica Garside, 18, who used to catch the bus to school with the girls, said: 'Trisha was really clever and always had a nice word to say about people.' Chris Sampson, the headmaster at Thornton Grammar School, where Nisha Lad and her sister Trisha both studied, said: 'We are deeply shocked and saddened by these tragic deaths. Our thoughts are with the family's relatives and friends. We will be helping the police with their inquiry in any way we can.' Tributes: Leeds University biochemistry student Trisha, 19, left and right, was called the 'one of the sweetest and kindest people' by friends today . The University of Leeds confirmed Trisha was in the second year of a biochemistry degree. A spokesman said: 'This is dreadful and shocking news and our thoughts are with Trisha's friends and loved ones. 'Staff are working with the University's counselling and chaplaincy services to help students who are affected by this tragedy and we will do all we can to support them.' Melissa Taylor, president of the Faculty of Biological Sciences Society at the university, said on Twitter: 'Heartbreaking to hear about the death of Trisha Lad, such a lovely, well-liked person. Rest in Peace.' Steph Mapplebeck said: 'Trisha Lad was one of the sweetest and kindest people I have met whilst studying at Leeds. What a heartbreaking loss. Rest in peace.'","Jitendra Lad, 49, probably murdered family over the weekend as they slept .

"The man who allegedly lied to secure a $400,000-a-year position with Myer is now being accused of also using fake CVs to con his way into four other lucrative jobs. American businessman Andrew Flanagan is accused of falsifying his credentials to secure a senior role with Myer in June this year. On Monday, Flanagan fronted Melbourne Magistrates’ Court for a committal mention hearing, facing nine fraud charges. The court was told that Flanagan organised friends to pose as former employers, supplying Myer recruitment firm Quest International with fake references, numbers and email addresses. Mr Flanagan was fired by Myer on his first day when suspicions were raised that the 36-year-old had conned his way into his high-level job. Andrew Flanagan is accused of lying about his employment history to gain employment with five different companies, including a senior role with Myer in June this year .

It's alleged by the Prosecution that Flanagan was paid more than $170,000 whilst working in the roles, according to Herald Sun. Flanagan is also facing charges of 'obtaining financial advantage by deception and theft' through his dishonest conduct. According to claims in court documents filed during the hearing today, Flanagan secured four other lucrative, high-level positions. Flanagan is accused of acquiring a $350,000-a-year job with Speciality Fashion Group by providing a fake CV, according to the court documents. It's alleged the company paid Flanagan more than $106,000 whilst he worked as their Chief Operating Officer between February and April this year. The businessman was also allegedly hired as CEO for the Australian Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry from November 2013 to February of this year. The 46-year-old is being charged with obtaining more than $32,000 from the company, as well as stealing a laptop. To secure the role with Myer, it is alleged Mr Flanagan claimed to have held several ‘senior executive business positions’ including roles with international retail chain Zara and UK company Tesco .

He is being accused of fraudulently obtaining $20,000 from the TAFE. According to court documents, in 2011, he reportedly fabricated his employment history to attain a $180,000-a-year executive role with Bendigo Health.

Flanagan claimed to have held several ‘senior executive business positions’ including roles with International retail chain Zara and UK company Tesco. Myer was allegedly informed by corporation Inditex, the Spanish owners of Zara, that Flanagan had never held a position with the company, the court heard. Mr Flanagan's defence lawyer Rowan Slattery told a committal mention hearing on Monday he disputed some of the witness evidence and added there were issues around whether a falsity in a resume constituted the alleged deception. But Magistrate Charles Rozencwajg said: ""If he handed up references and they were false, that's really what the charge is all about."" Mr Rozencwajg said the issue went ""south"" after Myer announced Flanagan's appointment in the media and the alleged deception became known and Flanagan was not performing as well as someone with his credentials was expected to. Flanagan's bail was extended until December 15 for a one-day committal hearing in the Melbourne Magistrates Court.

"This is the moment a Metropolitan Police officer was caught on camera appearing to use a mobile phone while behind the wheel of a marked vehicle. The policewoman was filmed apparently using a device while at the wheel as she waited at traffic lights in Hackney, east London, on Wednesday. Passing cyclist Junaid McClymont, 24, said he spotted the WPC 'holding the phone up to her mouth' and purposely caught up with the marked police van to catch the incident on camera. Scroll down for video . The young female officer was filmed apparently using a device (right) and 'holding it up to her mouth' (left) while behind the wheel as she waited at red traffic lights in the marked police van in Hackney, east London . He said: 'I was cycling through Hackney with my friend and the police van went past us. He realised she was on the phone and we thought ""We can get them here"". 'Luckily the lights went red so they had to stop and we caught up to them. He said that it was at this point he filmed the footage which allegedly shows her using a mobile behind the wheel. 'She had no idea until I got to the window.' he added. It's hilarious.' In the short video, the young policewoman can be seen holding an object - believed to be a mobile - just inches from her face. He can be heard confronting her by saying: 'I just caught you on your phone while driving,' but she quickly denies any wrongdoing through the window and replies: 'I'm not on the phone, am I?' Mr McClymont, a fitness instructor from Tottenham, north London, said: 'When she sees me, it looks as though she tries to hide it. He added that it appears 'she's been caught doing what everyone else does' by lowering the object onto her lap out of view when confronted. 'Everyone thinks it's so funny that she's been caught,' he said. Cyclist Junaid McClymont, 24, said he saw the policewoman (pictured) 'holding the mobile phone' before confronting her by saying: 'I just caught you on your phone while driving'. She responded: 'I'm not on the phone, am I?' Mr McClymont gives the camera a thumbs up after confronting the policewoman as she sits in the van . 'I posted it because I wanted to say ""You're not perfect, you're just as bad as everyone else"". 'All the information is there, and if I wanted to, I could take it further.' Mr McClymont captured the van's registration plate before he cycled away and is thought to be considering whether to report it to the force. The Metropolitan Police confirmed it had been made aware of the footage. A spokesman said: 'The majority of police personnel in Hackney borough work extremely hard and to the highest standards of professionalism to keep our communities safe. 'When officers or staff fall short of these high standards, it is absolutely right that it is brought to our attention. 'Senior officers at Hackney have been made aware of this particular incident and will take the appropriate action.'","Policewoman caught using what appears to be mobile phone while driving .

The moment Ben Burnell punched and kicked a man in the head until he passed out in Civic in Canberra's inner city was recorded on CCTV. Prosecutors told ACT Magistrates Court that the July attack was 'short but sustained and very vicious', according to the ABC. Scroll down for video . Ben Burnell punched and kicked a man until he passed out  in Canberra over a comment about his hair do . The 26-year-old man  was caught bashing another man on CCTV in Civic in Canberra's inner city . Magistrate Peter Dingwell said the assault launched by Burnell, from Canberra, was a serious offence and was a knee jerk reaction to comment made about a hair do. 'The reason he committed the offence remains a mystery,' Mr Dingwell said. 'It was a somewhat spur of the moment action, a disproportionate response to a jocular remark.'

"Andy Carroll and captain Kevin Nolan face a frustrating challenge to win back their West Ham places despite returning this week from long-term injuries, boss Sam Allardyce has warned. Carroll played 60 minutes in a practice match against Southend United at Chadwell Heath training ground on Wednesday lunchtime - his first appearance for the club since he injured his ankle ligaments on the club’s pre-season tour to New Zealand. The club’s £15m record-signing, whose time at Upton Park has been plagued by injuries, may start on the bench for the visit of Aston Villa this weekend, but is expected to be back to full fitness at the end of this month. Andy Carroll has not played yet this season, and will have to wait his turn as others have found form . New signings Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia have both been scoring goals in Carroll's absence . However Allardyce has now stressed that given the Hammers’ outstanding start to the Premier League, he cannot promise his otherwise tried-and-trusted lieutenants, many of whom played in the club’s promotion-winning season of 2011-12, that they will get much game time this campaign. Allardyce said: ‘Everybody faces a challenge (to start) compared to last season because of the strength-in-depth of the squad. Our squad has proven to be strong until now. ‘Even my trusted captain, Kevin Nolan, has found it difficult to break his way into the side and is extremely frustrated – as are a few of the sides. ‘Matt Jarvis, having returned from injury, is another player frustrated. So, too, Ricardo vaz Te and Joey O’Brien. These were my regular players last season. Because the other players have done so well while they have been away, it has been difficult for me to put (the regulars) back in based on our performances and results. Sam Allardyce says he has to manage the disappointment of players who are used to being regulars . Kevin Nolan (right) has not been able to get a regular spot in the team, despite being Allardyce's captain . ‘(Carroll’s availability) depends on how he feels when he gets in and trains tomorrow. That will be the deciding factor if he gets into the squad or not. Certainly, if he continues the way he is, then if not this weekend but by the end of the international break, he should be okay and ready to join the squad. ‘I have to manage any disappointment. I have to look at the individuals and make sure they stay focused and concentrated. The dynamic can change in a split-second and if players on the sidelines are not mentally or physically ready to step back into the team, then we all suffer. My responsibility is to keep the group focused and eager to wait for that opportunity to come.’ Summer signings like Alex Song mean that West Ham's squad is now stronger than ever, says Allardyce . Valencia scores against Stoke as West Ham fought back from behind to keep up their good league form . Senegal international Diafra Sakho, scorer of seven goals in eight matches this season, is expected to be fit for the Villa match at Upton Park despite hurting his shoulder in the 2-1 victory over champions Manchester City on October 25. Allardyce added: ‘Sakho is training today for the first time. He is going to train, but it will be light training. Winston Reid came off injured so we will wait and see how his injury is this morning. 'We will wait and see and the final decision will be made tomorrow on who is available for selection.’","West Ham are fifth in the Barclays Premier League .

"Google donated more money to political campaigns this year than global investment bank Goldman Sachs, it has been revealed. The technology giant's political spending wing, NetPAC, spent $1.43 million attempting to guide policymakers' hands in Washington - $30,000 more than that shelled out by Goldman in the same period. The figures, reveled by the Financial Times today, signal a dramatic surge in Google's political ambitions in recent years as it seeks to branch out from online search into other fields, from driverless cars to 'curing death'. Political ambitions: The technology giant's political spending wing, NetPAC, spent $1.43 million attempting to guide policymakers' hands in Washington - $30,000 more than that shelled out by Goldman in the same period . This rise is reflected in the fact that, in the build up to the midterms in 2010, Google spent just a third as much as Goldman. Silicon Valley tech companies are investing heavily in political lobbying in a bid to gain greater influence over debates on issues such as tax, the greater allocation of visas to skilled migrant workers and greater control over U.S. intelligence agencies data-collection activities. Big ambitions: The figures, reveled by the Financial Times today, signal a dramatic surge in Google's political ambitions in recent years as it seeks to branch out from online search into other fields, from driverless cars (pictured) to 'curing death' Microsoft was the biggest spender, donating $1.78 million, while Facebook spent £375,000 and Amazon paid $177,000. The Center for Responsive Politics found that, in 2010, Democratic federal candidates received 55 per cent of PAC contributions from tech firms, while Republicans received 45 per cent. Microsoft: $1.78m . Google: $1.43m . Facebook: $375,000 . Amazon: $177,000 . Meanwhile, in 2014, the balance shifted as Democrats received 48 per cent of Silicon Valley donations to the Republicans' 52 per cent. 'The executives of those companies may not always agree with Republicans on social issues, but for a lot of them, at the end of the day, business is business,' said Reed Galen, a Republican consultant based in California. Tech and internet donors have given almost $22.5 million so far in the 2014 election drive, according to the CRP. It is still less than the $121 million donated by the securities and investment industry, but nevertheless shows a significant uplift in the tech industry's appetite for political sway. Twitter and Yelp have both set up PACs in recent years, while Apple and Uber, who have not, have increased spending on political lobbyists. In the ten years since its IPO, Google has spent at least $23 billion buying more than 140 companies. They not only include YouTube and Android, but also firms specializing in robots, artificial intelligence, product-delivery drones, driverless cars and smart homes. Last year, Google acquired Calico, a biotech life-extension company with a mission, as Time Magazine wrote, to 'cure death'.","Google spent $1.43m last year through its political spending wing NetPAC .

"Ahlem Gamri was always sipping bottled water in an effort to drink the recommended eight glasses a day . Like many women, Ahlem Gamri was always sipping bottled water in an effort to drink the recommended eight glasses a day. As a consultant in the oil and gas industry, who travels around the world, she kept a bottle in her handbag to drink on the move. ‘It’s common knowledge that drinking water is fundamental in maintaining health,’ she says. But despite her best efforts to stay healthy, she was baffled when she began to suffer from a range of symptoms. ‘I felt bloated and wiped out, no matter how much sleep I got,’ says Ahlem, 37, from London. ‘I tried cutting out bread and exercised more in a bid to boost my metabolism and snap me out of it, but I still felt terrible. I had odd symptoms that would flare up and subside without warning — muscle aches, joint pain, dizziness, palpitations, nausea.’ For three years, she consulted endocrinologists, neurologists, gastroenterologists, rheumatologists and immunologists. Every expert offered different solutions to the symptoms — but none could explain what was actually wrong. ‘It wasn’t until I saw naturopathic doctor Nigma Talib that I got any answers,’ says Ahlem. ‘After a battery of tests, she identified I had a magnesium deficiency.’ Surprisingly, some think drinking bottled water may be a contributing factor. This little-heard-of deficiency is surprisingly common among women — one survey found one in ten suffers from it, but some experts cite figures as high as seven in ten — and the effects can be devastating. From maintaining energy levels to steadying heart rhythm, regulating blood pressure and keeping bones strong, magnesium is vital for the body. Scroll down for video . Symptoms of deficiency include agitation and anxiety, restless leg syndrome, sleep disorders, nausea and vomiting, abnormal heart rhythms, muscle spasm and weakness, hyperventilation, poor nail growth and even seizures. And, disastrously, modern diets are not just lacking in magnesium — they actively deplete it. The recommended daily intake for adults is 420mg for men and 320mg for women. Once this would have been easy to get from a mix of wholegrains, green leafy vegetables, nuts and meat. Magnesium is the second most abundant metal . in seawater — only salt is more abundant . But intensive farming has seen the magnesium content in vegetables decline by as much as 80 per cent since 1950. Caffeine, alcohol, processed grains and sugar prompt the kidneys to expel magnesium, depleting already low levels still further. Moreover, many of us have swapped a significant source of magnesium — tap water — for bottled water, which often has a far lower content. Modern lifestyles are also at fault. Stress can be a cause and a symptom of magnesium deficiency. The stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol, released in ‘fight or flight’ situations, deplete the body’s natural stores. But as magnesium helps to regulate blood pressure and heart rhythm, a deficiency may mean stress is tougher to handle. Dr Christy Ferguson uses magnesium to treat migraines as it has a relaxing and calming effect on the body . These low magnesium levels are difficult to diagnose. A blood test rarely helps as just 1 per cent of the body’s magnesium stores are found in blood. The rest is in our bones and muscles. Worse still, typical symptoms of magnesium deficiency — pain, fatigue, insomnia and muscle cramps — are common to many other conditions so doctors may wrongly diagnose anything from irritable bowel syndrome and pre-menstrual tension to migraine and fibromyalgia. In France, magnesium is offered to patients suffering from PMT, stress or fatigue. Nutritional therapist Dr Christy Ferguson says: ‘Magnesium hasn’t had much publicity — the food industry doesn’t use it to promote its products as it does with calcium. Magnesium deficiency is hard to diagnose, so many people don’t know they have it.’ Ahlem Gamri, 37, from London, consulted endocrinologists, neurologists, gastroenterologists, rheumatologists and immunologists about her fatigue . Ironically, calcium is useless without magnesium, which is why a deficiency is implicated in osteoporosis. So experts argue that many typical manifestations of ageing — loss of muscle mass, rising blood pressure and diminished nervous system function — are because the body’s ability to metabolise magnesium may decrease with age. Dr Ferguson uses magnesium to treat migraines as it has a relaxing and calming effect on the body. A German study found a 41.6 per cent drop in migraine frequency among sufferers who were given a supplement, and it can also treat asthma by suppressing histamine production. But many medications can cause a magnesium deficiency, as Mary Wood discovered. The 60-year-old retired consultant from Warwick suffered from acid reflux for years, controlling it with over-the-counter remedies. But when her discomfort worsened, her GP prescribed omeprazole tablets, a type of medicine known as a proton-pump inhibitor, which have been found to inhibit magnesium absorption when used long-term. Although they eased the heartburn, after 18 months she had an unusual side-effect. ‘I had a strange sensation down my left side,’ says Mary. ‘Over months, it developed from a kind of fluttering into a spasm, as if an unborn baby was kicking me.’ Mary’s GP was baffled. ‘All his tests were inconclusive, which worried me even more,’ she says. ‘All sorts of horrible illnesses came into my mind, including cancer.’ Her husband, John, did some internet research and within 15 minutes he had found a cause. ‘He told me lots of people were complaining on forums of the same symptoms and that they turned out to have magnesium deficiency,’ says Mary. ‘He told me beetroot contains magnesium, and we had a ready supply on the allotment. ‘We started eating it in salads, soups, everything. Within a couple of days, the pain stopped, just like that.’ Mary told her GP about her self-diagnosis and treatment. ‘He said he’d just been reading new research about magnesium deficiency, so clearly doctors are catching on to it at last,’ she says. ‘I had no idea just how vital it was to our bodies. It’s incredible to think I lived with these symptoms for so long and yet the remedy was so simple.’ In fact, digestive conditions such as acid reflux are often related to magnesium deficiency, and medications can make the problem even worse. Mary’s GP switched her to another indigestion remedy, Ranitidine, and the discomfort never recurred. But when her heartburn worsened a year ago and the doctor prescribed a stronger medication called Esomeprazole, Mary added a magnesium supplement to her diet, as well as upping her intake of beetroot and other magnesium-rich food. ‘It is common for people suffering from digestive problems to have a magnesium deficiency,’ says Dr Ferguson. ‘If your digestive system isn’t working properly, the acids in your stomach will not break down food, preventing the absorption of vital nutrients.’ For Ahlem, help came in the form of an intravenous vitamin cocktail, including magnesium, prescribed by Dr Talib. ‘Within days, I could feel a significant improvement as my symptoms started to fade away and became more manageable,’ she says. ‘I began eating magnesium-rich foods, such as pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds and avocados. ‘Dr Talib also explained that I needed supplements to support my adrenal gland because poor adrenal function encourages the body to expel high levels of magnesium as waste. ‘No one ever talks about magnesium, so I had no idea I needed it in my diet — let alone that being deficient could have such a dramatic impact on my life.’ thefoodpsychologist.com . healthydoc.com .","Ahlem Gamri, 37, from London felt bloated and wiped out, no matter how much sleep she got .

"A Syrian refugee who doused herself with petrol and set herself on fire after her aid was cut by the United Nations, was a victim of a lack of funding for the world body's work, an official for the organisation has said. Mariam al-Khawli, who fled to Lebanon from Syria with her husband and four children two years ago, set herself on fire outside U.N. offices last week in frustration at living without the food and cash lifeline provided by the organisation since August. While a teenager from central Syria became the millionth Syrian refugee to register in Lebanon today, earlier in the week Khawli explained how help given to her by the U.N. from August 2012 was stopped in August 2013. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mariam al-Khawli, who fled Syria with her husband and four children two years ago, set herself on fire last week in frustration at living without aid from the United Nations . A U.N. official has said Khawli was the victim of a lack of funding for the world body's work . She said: 'They told us they wouldn't cut support for those who have medical cases - my husband had a lung abscess and does not work.' Three of her children also have a blood condition and the family had relied on the aid. 'I chose death, I chose death rather than seeing my children die a million times in front of me,' she told a CNN reporter. Her story has become well known over the past days, after appearing in news outlets in Lebanon. 'I only told them food and beverage, we really got hungry,' she told Reuters. 'My four children are studying in schools, I said they can't work, their health situation doesn't allow them to work. 'I want them to study so they can get a job and relax, but they burned my heart before they burned my body. They burned my heart from the inside.' Her doctor, Gabriel al-Sabeh, said 70 . per cent of Khawli's body was now covered in burns and that she could . remain in hospital for months if she survives. Ninette . Kelley, regional representative for Lebanon at the Office of the United . Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said: 'Right now we have close . to 1 million refugees and we are able to do a lot with the funding we . receive but we simply do not have enough.' Khawli's doctor, Gabriel al-Sabeh, said 70 per cent of her body was now covered in burns and that she could remain in hospital for months if she survives . She said Khawli's case was 'a very sorrowful reflection of the enormous desperation and need of the refugee community and it is also a telling reminder of the consequences of the Syrian emergency and the unfolding crisis here in Lebanon'. She said the agency had been in touch with Khawli's family 'for many, many months', but gave no details of why the funds were cut or how many other families might have been affected. U.N. aid teams in Lebanon give aid to the most vulnerable first and makes regular checks on families who are not covered, Kelley said. Last month, Lebanon's foreign minister said the crisis was 'threatening the existence of Lebanon', still recovering from its own bloody 15-year civil war that ended in 1990. Syrian beggars now walk the streets of Beirut and informal tented settlements have sprung up around the country. Khawli's husband is unable to work due to a lung abscess and three of her children have a blood condition. The family had relied on the aid . Syrian rebels and their Lebanese allies fight openly with the army and militants from the Lebanese Hezbollah militia, which supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in a war now in its fourth year. The United Nations says 2.5 million Syria refugees have registered in total, more than 10 per cent of Syria's population. Lebanon holds the largest number but Syrians have also fled to Turkey, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt and elsewhere. A U.N. appeal for $1.7 billion in 2014 to help the refugees is only 14 per cent funded, Kelley said. The mounting cost of the refugee crisis is also a major challenge for Lebanon's new government, which has to deal with strained public infrastructure as the Syrians seek housing, food, and healthcare at a time of economic slowdown in Lebanon. Showing how the conflict is spilling over, two missiles on Wednesday hit Al-Labwa, a Shi'ite town in Lebanon that has been hit before by Sunni militants in retaliation for Shi'ite Hezbollah's role in Syria. The strikes are the latest in a series of missile attacks, bomb explosions and gun fights that have grown as the Syria conflict has become increasingly sectarian.","Mariam al-Khawli fled Syria with husband and four children two years ago .

"An agricultural college has filmed a toe-curling gangster rap video featuring a Jennifer Lopez-lookalike in the hope of encouraging young people to consider a career in farming. The cringe-inducing video by Easton and Otley College in East Anglia features a hip hop version of  The Wurzles' novelty hit 'Combine Harvester, and students performing choreographed dance moves. The college says it hopes the video - which has already been viewed more than 35,000 times on YouTube and features agricultural students bragging about their earnings - will make farming look cool and attract young people into a profession dominated by aging men. Scroll down for video . Rapping farmer Jessica Jayne Stone, pictured, was a body double for Jennifer Lopez in a music video . Ms Stone was joined on the video by fellow professional performer Ricky Jinx, left . The bizarre video features professional dancers Ricky Jinx and Jessica Jayne Stone, who was a body double for Jennifer Lopez.The rest of the cast, however, are students at the college. Justifying the use of gangster rap in the clip, John Nice, spokesman for the college, said: 'We recently released a video that aims to get more young people interested in farming. 'The average age of a farmer in the UK is someone in their 50s. We want to show young people that there are good careers available working in agriculture.' Mr Nice added that he wanted people with no connection with farming to consider it as a career. In true hip hop style, the video is packed with  braggadocio, with one of the students even rapping: 'I used to be on £10k but now I'm on 33!'

"A man stabbed his friend's grandmother in the heart and slashed her face more than 40 times to steal £104 of her pension before telling a court he had acted in self-defence. Liam Naylor, who referred to himself as 'superstud' during an appearance on Jeremy Kyle, brutally murdered Doreen Walker at her home in Cudworth, Barnsley after telling friends he was finding money for a night out. Leaving the 75-year-old's body lying on the ground with a kitchen knife lodged in her neck, he spent the stolen money on alcohol and McDonald's for his friends, including the victim's granddaughter, that night. Liam Naylor (left), 23, brutally murdered Doreen Walker (right) in her home in Cudworth, Barnsley for £104 . After fleeing to Skegness with the victim's granddaughter Keeley Sweeney, 17, he was arrested and charged with the pensioner's murder but told Sheffield Crown Court he had acted in self-defence. Naylor, who has four children and once appeared on Jeremy Kyle amid a paternity dispute with one of the children's mothers, was convicted of murder following a week-long trial. Sheffield Crown Court heard Naylor, 23, sent a text message to a friend telling them to lay out clean clothes for him to go out in Barnsley after murdering Mrs Walker in her home on April 1. He had visited the house that evening after telling friends he was sourcing money for a night out. Rifling through the woman's home - where he had stayed overnight with Miss Sweeney three weeks before the attack - he found £104 pension money which had been picked up that day. Naylor then carried out the 'savage' attack, after which he laid Mrs Walker's head on a pillow before washing his hands of her blood. He then sent himself a string of text messages to create a false alibi involving borrowing money. Friends of the man told the court he had returned 'agitated' and covered in blood before going out and torching his stained clothes in a city centre underpass. Naylor was captured on CCTV entering the woman's home about 9.30pm and emerged two hours later . Police arrested Naylor after Mrs Walker's body was found in her home the following morning by her son-in-law . He treated friends to a night out, then fled to Skegness with Miss Sweeney, Mrs Walker's granddaughter' the following day. Following his initial arrest, he told police he hadn't harmed the woman and that a cut on his hand, sustained during the murder, was inflicted when he fought a man in the street who was carrying a knife. Later, he told the court the woman had 'jumped into' the kitchen knife after Naylor took it from her when she 'came at him' with it in her hand and that he was acting in self defence. The claims were dismissed as 'ludicrous and utterly incredible' by prosecutor Simon Waley during the trial. Naylor was unanimously convicted of murder today and will be sentenced at Sheffield Crown Court today. Detective Superintendent Richard Fewkes today said: 'It remains unclear what was going through his mind when he committed one of the most brutal murders I have dealt with in my 29-year career. Following a week-long trial Naylor was unanimously convicted of murder by a jury at Sheffield Crown Court (pictured). He will be sentenced tomorrow . 'Whatever motive there was can never excuse the brutality of the assault. It was a brutal, savage and unprovoked attack and the account he put forward that he was acting in self-defence was ludicrous. 'I have watched Liam Naylor give evidence and throughout there was an air or arrogance about him. On occasions he was even smiling. 'That sums him up. Doreen was very much a home bird and an elderly woman. She was frail and . had the onset of arthritis and was partially deaf but she was kind and on occasions extended that kindness to Liam Naylor which makes this offence even more abhorrent.' The 23-year-old will be sentenced tomorrow. Following his conviction an episode of Jeremy Kyle in which he describes himself as 'superstud' emerged. During his appearance he tells the audience he has stolen money in the past to 'be there for his children'.","Liam Naylor stabbed Doreen Walker, 75, more than 40 times .

"Two lawmakers involved in yesterday's grilling of Secret Service Director Julia Pierson at a House committee hearing and the House Minority Leader now say the security chief should be relieved of her duties. The Members of Congress' change of heart came after two news organizations revealed on Tuesday night that just three days before a knife-wielding veteran broke into the White House, the Secret Service inadvertently let an armed man who was not part of Obama's security detail ride in an elevator with him. Reps. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, and Elijah Cummings, a Democrat who represents Maryland, both offered a vote of no confidence in Pierson's ability to lead the beleaguered government agency in light of the new information. 'It's time that she be fired by the president of the United States or she resign,' Chaffetz said on Tuesday evening. Cummings shared a similar sentiment with MSNBC on Wednesday. 'I have come to the conclusion that my confidence and my trust in this director, Ms. Pierson, has eroded,' he said, 'and I do not feel comfortable with her in that position.' A third member, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, also chimed in on Wednesday, saying she agreed with Cummings. Scroll down for video . Two senior members of the House Oversight and Government Reform committee, Reps. Jason Chaffetz and Elijah Cummings, now say that Secret Service Director Julia Pierson, pictured here at yesterday's hearing before the committee, should be canned . The lawmakers' change of heart came after it was revealed on Tuesday evewning that President Barack Obama rode in the same elevator as a man carrying a handgun when he visited the CDC on September 16 . 'If Mr. Cummings thinks that she should go, I subscribe to his recommendation,' Pelosi said in a statement reported on by Time. 'I am subscribing to his superior judgment and knowledge on the subject. The startling revelation that the Commander-in-Chief's security was compromised a second time last month came hours after members of the House Oversight and Government Reform committee interrupted their fall break to come back to Washington and question Pierson about the recent lapses in security. The newest security slip up happened on Obama's September 16 trip to Atlanta, Georgia, for a briefing on the Ebola crisis at a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facility. At the CDC, Obama and his security detail where in an elevator when a contract security officer operating the lift began taking photos and video of the president. Sources told the Washington Examiner and Washington Post that the unnamed CDC officer ignored Secret Service orders to out the phone away, but he continued to act 'oddly' and 'unprofessionally.' When the president exited the elevator, Secret Service staff stayed behind to question the CDC employee with his supervisor, at which point they discovered he had was carrying a gun. The Washington Post reported that the man also had three prior convictions for assault and battery, but the Associated Press disputes that claim. AP said Wednesday it had not been able to confirm that the man had in fact been convicted of the crimes and pointed out that felons are not allowed own or operate guns. Either way, the Secret Service is supposed to conduct background checks on employees who work at venues the president will visit, and only law enforcement are allowed to carry guns in the the president's presence. Chaffetz was outraged on Tuesday to find about another Secret Service indiscretion. 'You have a convicted felon within arm’s reach of the president, and they never did a background check. Words aren’t strong enough for the outrage I feel for the safety of the president and his family,' Chaffetz told the Washington Post. 'His life was in danger. This country would be a different world today if he had pulled out his gun,' he added. Pierson is reportedly having a top agency manager look into the matter. Pierson apologized for a Sept. 19 White House perimeter breach by a man carrying a knife at yesterday's hearing only to find agency under scrutiny for another security lapse hours later . The besieged government official already had her plate full on Tuesday after having spent three hours under interrogation before the Oversight committee. In Tuesday's hearing Pierson disclosed that at least two uniformed officers noticed Army veteran Omar J Gonzales acting strange outside the White House just before he jumped the fence and made it all the way to the East Room on September 19. Gonzalez had been stopped outside the White House before while carrying a small hatchet on August 25 and the officers remembered him from that run-in. Yet they did not take action before the recent incident, Pierson said, after observing him 'for some time.' 'It is clear that our security plan was not executed properly,' she told lawmakers. 'I take full responsibility; what happened is unacceptable and it will never happen again.' Members of Congress from both political parties have been unimpressed with her apology, however. 'I am deeply concerned with the lack of transparency from the Secret Service regarding the recent security breach at the White House,' House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul said on Tuesday, referring to the Sept. 19 incident. 'This latest episode adds to the growing list of failures from an agency plagued by operational challenges, cultural problems and reporting difficulties,' the Texas Republican said. McCaul is pushing for an independent review of the Secret Service. AP noted that since the White House break in no Secret Service agents have been fired or even demoted. House Speaker John Boehner seconded McCaul's request on Wednesday, saying that given duties of the Secret Service, 'we are right to expect nothing but candor and clarity from its leaders.' 'The more we discover, the clearer it becomes that the Secret Service is beset by a culture of complacency and incompetence,' Boehner said in a statement. 'As such, the president must make a swift determination on whether the agency is being well-served by its current leadership. 'Moreover, I fully support Chairman McCaul’s plan for a top-to-bottom, independent review of the agency. The courageous men and women of the Secret Service who put their lives in harm’s way every day deserve the best possible leadership and a culture worthy of their sacrifices,' Boehner said. Pelosi said on Wednesday that she also supports an independent investigation in the agency, which is managed by the Department of Homeland Security. After calling for Pierson to be canned, the top Democrat noted that the Secret Service director is not the only person at fault for the barrage of security breaches. '[T]his is more than one person because there were problems before she went there,' Pelosi said, according to Time. 'Her leaving doesn’t end the need for us to know a lot more about what is happening,' the California Congresswoman said.

"A senior US congressman has provided chilling purported details about an Islamic State terror plot to kidnap and behead an Australian, in an apparent reference to last month's terror raids. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the US House Intelligence Committee, told FOX News 14 Australian IS recruits were 'ready to go to Syria' at the time and 'further their radicalisation'. But Rogers said the recruits were told to stay in Australia. He said they received a note from IS which said:  'No, No. What we want you to do, stay in Australia. We want you to randomly kidnap people off the street, behead them, videotape it, send it to us for further propaganda.' Scroll down for video . Mohammad Ali Baryalei was ringleader of the beheading plot, it has been alleged . Mike Rogers provided chilling purported details about an ISIS terror plot to kidnap and behead  Australians . Australian militant Khaled Sharrouf posted this horror image of his son wielding a decapitated head in Raqqa, Syria, earlier this year . Terrorism expert Professor Greg Barton told Daily Mail Australia the remarks were presumably a reference to the September 18 dawn terror raids, the largest the nation has witnessed. More than 800 NSW and federal police were involved in the operation, which saw Omarjan Azari, 22, arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit a terrorist act. A court heard Azari had received a call from senior Australian Islamic State militant Mohammad Ali Baryalei and was instructed to behead a random member of the public in Sydney. Omarjan Azari, 22, was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit a terrorist offence during last month's counter-terrorism raids . Prof Barton said it was unclear what briefings Rogers had received on the matter, and whether his remarks about Australians intending to flee to Syria were accurate. 'He seems to be speaking with some confidence on these (issues)', Prof Barton, from Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, told Daily Mail Australia. Rogers linked a security boost at 9,500 US federal buildings with the alleged terror plot. 'They wanted to have a high-profile event in a Western country,' Rogers said. Australian militant: Khaled Sharrouf is fighting for the Islamic State in the Middle East . Guns and jihad: Sharrouf posted this picture of him and his family decked out in military fatigues this year . 'They wanted to show that they could reach out and strike a Western country, which is why we believe now you see all of this activity - Canada, the United States, across Europe, Germany, France, Spain, because they're actively working at trying to find an event that happens in a Western country that they can take credit for.' Daily Mail Australia has approached the Australian Federal Police for comment on Rogers' remarks. Friends this week said the ringleader of the alleged beheading plot, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, had been killed in the Middle East.

"A man who was trapped in his car for nine hours after a crash has miraculously survived without a scratch. Adam Davidson, 36, blacked out after his car flipped over a hedge in Hereford on Friday and was left trapped overnight, dangling precariously over a stream. When he came round the following morning and was able to call for help, emergency services faced a race against time to find him before he lost consciousness again. Mr Davidson, a diabetic, had no idea where he was, so operators were forced to launch a massive search operation across the county in a bid to locate him. A huge rescue team was sent to track Mr Davidson's location after the crash in Hereford, which left the driver unconscious and trapped in his car overnight, dangling precariously over a stream . Four fire engines were sent across north Herefordshire with their sirens blaring - and after an hour of Mr Davidson indicating whether the sirens were getting closer or not, he was finally located. And when he was finally freed, Mr Davidson had no serious injuries and was allowed home after a quick visit to the hospital. Mr Davidson, a chef, was driving home from work at the Tram Inn in Eardisley when he was almost crushed in the accident. He remained out cold overnight as his car hung over the water and his body temperature dropped dangerously low. Hereford Fire and Rescue received his call at 7.30am on Saturday and mounted an urgent attempt to locate him. As the fire engines drove around, the operator used his indicators of whether the sirens were getting closer or further away to trace him. After 40 minutes, the rescue team had narrowed his location down to within a few miles - but it took another 20 minutes before he was found and could be treated by paramedics at the scene. Mr Davidson suffered no serious injuries and was readmitted to Hereford County Hospital for further checks a day later.

"Though melanoma and other skin cancers are some of the most common in older people, it is extremely rare to see them in toddlers. But  Matt and Michelle Prebble found out the hard way it can still occur, when their two-year-old daughter Frankie was diagnosed with a melanoma. 'Everyone was in shock,' Michelle told Daily Mail Australia. 'We saw her surgeon on a Monday and he wanted to operate the next day.' Scroll down for video . Frankie Prebble, here with dad Matt, was just two years old when she was diagnosed with a melanoma . The Cancer Council of Australia state that two in three Australians will be diagnosed with some form of skin cancer by the time they are 70, but it is extremely rare for anyone under 4 to be diagnosed. What started off as a small red spot 'the size of a pin-head' on Frankie's arm last year, quickly developed into a larger mark setting off alarm bells. 'It started growing and we thought okay, this is a bit unusual', Michelle, from Perth in West Australia, said. From there a trip to the GP and a follow-up appointment with a dermatologist put Frankie on the fast-track to having surgery in April of this year. 'She had one surgery and it came back as a spitzoid melanoma,' Michelle revealed. Frankie then had to undergo a second surgery to create more of a buffer around the site where the tumor was. And although Frankie did take a little while to recover from the surgery, she's fighting fit now. Mum Michelle Prebble (left) and dad Matt (top right) were shocked by the one in five million diagnosis . The youngster had to undergo two surgeries to completely remove the melanoma and now has rigorous and regular check-ups . 'It took a couple of months for everything to settle down, her arm was quite swollen and the scar was quite red,' her mum said. Wanting to put a 'positive spin' on the experience for their daughter, Matt and Michelle Prebble named the scar her 'brave mark' and  taught Frankie how to care for the sore on her own. 'She puts her own little gel on there twice a day', Michelle revealed. Following the procedures Frankie now requires regular and extensive check-ups and screenings, something she may have to undergo for the rest of her life. A check up two weeks ago put Frankie in the clear, however her parents are awaiting more tests from overseas to find out more information about the tumor. For now, the two-year-old has to undergo lymph node tests and skin scans every three months, plus has had one PET scans so far and will require another later in the year. Frankie's parents discovered a tiny red mark on her arm last year and were lucky enough to catch it early . Frankie's parents said they still have many questions about how their daughter got the disease so young . Although Frankie has healed well from her procedures the Prebbles still have 'a lot of questions hanging over our heads.' 'We want to know why a two-year-old is presented with such a diagnosis, it's obviously not sun-related as she's only two,' Michelle revealed. Frankie's surgeon was Dr Mark Lee, who works out of the St John of God Hospital in Subiaco. Dr Lee told Daily Mail Australia that patients like Frankie are 'unique and confronting' but also particularly puzzling as there must be another cause for the cancer besides sun exposure. 'There's no family history with Frankie, there's nothing that we can really put our finger on at all, it's a big mystery,' he said. Despite these rare instances, Dr Lee said the occurrence of such cancers in young people in West Australia is on the decline, and that's a positive for the nation as a whole. 'It suggests that the sun0-smart message is getting through in Australia', he said. Dr Lee also spoke to the ABC, telling them that while his young patient is cancer-free now, she will need to keep a close eye on things as she gets older. 'It doesn't mean we rest on our laurels. We still need to follow her up very closely, probably lifelong, since she's had something so early', he said. Michelle said there's no way her melanoma could have been sun-related as Frankie is so young . This weekend Matt is taking part in the Ride to Conquer Cancer and has already raised $7000 . The Prebbles were lucky to catch their daughter's melanoma early, but that's not the case for all people diagnosed with what can be a devastating disease. However the ABC reported there are six new drugs which have been approved for Australian clinical trials, described by Dr Lee as 'very exciting'. Keen to assist research in the area, Matt is taking part in the Sun Super Ride to Conquer Cancer this weekend in Perth - which entails completing a gruelling 200 kilometre bike ride. He's already raised over $7000 and hopes that some of the funds can contribute towards researching some of the rarer forms of cancer, like Frankie's. The Prebbles also shared their experience following a breakfast at the weekend, held by the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research in West Australia, a centre that along with Melanoma WA has been of great assistance to Frankie and Prebble family this year. The Prebbles hope the funds raised can go towards research for rare cancers like the one Frankie had .","Frankie Prebble was diagnosed with a melanoma in April of this year .

"They will certainly add a bit of colour to Windsor Castle. These flamboyant portraits of the Queen are the latest additions to the Royal Collection after they were acquired to mark the Diamond Jubilee. Created by pop artist Andy Warhol in 1985, the four prints feature blocks of luminous colour and are aptly sprinkled with diamond dust. Pop culture: Four Andy Warhol portraits of Queen Elizabeth II are seen in Windsor Castle and will form part of the 'Portraits of a Monarch' exhibit starting in November at the castle until June 2013 . The price has not been revealed, but a similar set of prints were sold at auction at Sotheby’s last week for £109,250. They were somewhat of a departure from the norm for the artist, who is known more for his prints of Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor and a tin of Campbell’s soup. Warhol, who once said he wanted to be ‘as famous as the Queen of England’, made them as part of his the Reigning Queens series. They will be displayed for the first time in the exhibition The Queen: Portraits Of A Monarch from November 23, which is being staged at Windsor Castle. On display:  Royal Collection staff members Lauren Porter (left), Allan Chinn, Martin Clayton (second right) and Kate Stone (right) pose with Warhol's portraits on the staircase leading to the viewings gallery . The brightly coloured images, which include one in electric blue and another in neon pink, are screenprints each measuring 39in (100cm) by 31.5in (80cm). As in many of his other famed works, he used an earlier photo to create his portrait, in this case a picture taken in April 1975 by photographer Peter Grugeon which was widely used during the Silver Jubilee celebrations two years later. The Queen can be seen wearing the Vladimir tiara, Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee necklace, Queen Alexandra’s wedding earrings and King George VI’s Family Order, pinned to the Garter sash. Other royals featured in Warhol’s series include Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, Queen Margrethe of Denmark and Queen Ntombi Twala of Swaziland. Renowned: Warhol, who once said he wanted to be 'as famous as the Queen of England', made the portraits as part of his the Reigning Queens series. He died in 1987 . The new exhibition will highlight the many different ways the Queen has been represented throughout her six decades on the throne. 'The Warhol prints of the Queen are in many ways the most important popular image of the Queen to be created by an artist print maker over the last few decades' Jane Roberts, Royal librarian . Royal librarian Jane Roberts described the portraits as ‘huge, extremely colourful and very striking’. She said: ‘The Warhol prints of the Queen are in many ways the most important popular image of the Queen to be created by an artist print maker over the last few decades. ‘What Andy Warhol did with print making was very new, and particularly in these images where he uses the same outlines and applies different colourways to it, which is something very personal to him. It’s playing around with an image in a way which is entirely new.’","Prints have blocks of luminous colour and are sprinkled with diamond dust .

"A lonely collie dog is desperate to find a new home after living in a rescue centre for 11 years thanks to his irrational fear of cars. Toby arrived at Hilbrae Pets Hotel as a ten-month-old stray in May 2003 and was expected to find a new home within weeks. But the 12-year-old is so frightened of vehicles that whoever adopts him will have to walk him home and keep him away from cars. Claudia Churchill works at the pets home where Toby has lived since 2003. She still hopes to find him a home for his old age . Toby has not been adopted because his fear of cars stops him from being taken away from the centre . It is thought Toby could be the longest serving dogs’ home resident in Britain - at Battersea Dogs Home, pets stay an average of just 29 days before being adopted. Toby now has his own Twitter account - @hilbraetoby - which has more than 3,000 followers who keep up tabs on his search for a home. However, no one has been able to adopt the animal, who will need to live in a home with no young children. Claudia Churchill, who has worked as a supervisor at the centre in Telford, Shropshire, for 22 years, is hoping someone will come forward and give him a retirement home. Staff have been unable to help Toby get over his fear of cars so he can finally leave the centre . Staff at Hilbrae Pets Hotel have cared for Toby since he arrived in 2003 as a 10-month-old stray . She said: 'He came into us as a ten-month-old and had a few issues. He was quite naughty. 'We don’t know how he was abandoned and we don’t know why he is scared of cars. People love him but he gets overlooked because of his fear. 'We don’t know if he was thrown from a car when he was abandoned, but he is terrified of them. Hilbrae supervisor Claudia Churchill said she would 'love nothing more' than for him to go to a new home . 'On one occasion he had a home but when the people went to open the boot for him he ran back to the kennels. 'He is a dear soul, he loves a walk, loves to chase a ball and is still fit. 'I’d love nothing more than for him to go to a new home, but he just won’t get into a car. The best thing would be if someone could somehow walk him home.'","Stray dog Toby has remained homeless for 11 years because he fears cars .

"Any hobby or interest that’s not sport-related is always portrayed on TV as something for sad and lonely people. If you’re not into football, the thinking goes, you must be an anorak with no social skills. Yet millions of us immerse ourselves in specialised pastimes that help us escape from the real world for a few hours every week: think fishing, motorcycling, stamp or coin-collecting. Or metal detecting, which happens to be the subject of a six-part BBC sitcom I’ve written and directed, as well as taking one of the leading roles, alongside Toby Jones. Created by Mackenzie Crook, Detectorists follows Andy, a wannabe archaeologist who, alongside his friend Lance, spends time in muddy fields with a metal detector . Whether or not you find the pastime interesting, the idea is intriguing. In the past few months, when telling people what I’ve been working on, the reaction has been strangely positive. The most frequent response goes along the lines of: ‘Oh, my dad used to have a metal detector! It’s probably still in the garage. He took us out with it a few times when we were kids. Never found anything, though.’ That strikes a chord with me. I’ve had a metal detector for years, but it’s what my wife calls my ‘imaginary hobby’. What she means is, I’ve got all the equipment and the know-how, but I hardly ever use it. Over the years, a silver sixpence, a Georgian shoe-buckle and a musket ball are probably my best finds. They’re not going to make the British Museum but it was exciting to unearth them nevertheless. The actor rose to Mackenzie Crook, who starred in The Office, . The idea for the show came to me a few years ago after an episode of Time Team which featured two detectorists — as they call themselves. It got me thinking about this strange pastime: a lonely and contemplative one, mostly carried out in autumn and winter, trudging up and down bleak stubble fields, headphones on, staring at the ground. We’ve all seen detectorists and wondered what they are looking for. Loose change? Or, more likely, treasure? Which is not as absurd as it may sound. Throughout history, whenever the threat of invasion has loomed, those with something to lose have buried their wealth in the ground for safekeeping. Once the danger passed, their riches would be dug up again. But sometimes those people would die before they had a chance to retrieve their treasure. Sometimes, no doubt, they forgot where they buried it. And so those secret hoards of coins and jewellery lie forgotten in the ground for centuries — until a metal detectorist comes along and finds them. It is one of these caches of treasure that Andy (that’s me) and Lance (Toby Jones) long to find in Detectorists — though more often than not they find only ring pulls and junk. I had sat on the idea for a year or so, mulling it over. Then I wrote a half-hour script. Not long after, I got to work for the first time with Toby Jones. Over the years, Toby and I have been in half a dozen of the same films but never actually shared screen time until our blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo in the latest Muppet movie. I’m sure that having his name attached went a long way towards the BBC’s decision to commission a six-part series, news of which came a few days after I arrived in Vancouver for a five-month stint on an American TV show, Almost Human. It turned out to be the ideal time to write the rest of the series. The idea for the show came to him a  few years ago after watching an episode of Time Team . As I wrote, I had such a clear vision of how the series should look and feel that it seemed only natural that I should direct it, too. But this was to be my first time directing, so I knew I had to gather a team around me that I could lean on and trust. One early set-back was that the National Council for Metal Detecting apparently did not want to be associated with the show. It was disappointing, as I could have done with some of their members’ advice. It seems that someone had decided I am out to ridicule the hobby, whereas nothing could be further from the truth. For filming, we chose as our base the beautiful Suffolk market town of Framlingham, using several locations in town, plus fields of neighbouring farms. I confess I found the first day of the shoot terrifying: suddenly, my vague idea of a comedy about metal detecting had become a reality and 50 people were waiting for me to start directing them. On day two, it poured all day. So much of Detectorists is set outside that I was counting on good weather to get the beautiful shots that we wanted and make the shoot an enjoyable experience for everyone. Thankfully, it was one of very few bad weather days we had. My character, Andy, is not a great talker. Toby’s character, Lance, is. Call it what you will — clever writing or laziness — but I had very little line learning to do. Toby had reams to memorise. He despaired at the long speeches he had to make on a daily basis, while I occasionally interjected with a monosyllable. It’s strange; at the beginning of an acting career you want as many lines to say as possible, but as the years go by you start looking for things to cut so you don’t have to say so much. But Toby learned every word and delivered them brilliantly. His character seems like a bit of an idiot at first, but you soon find out that he is a very wise and thoughtful man. It doesn’t matter what size the budget on a film or TV show, you will always try to get as much out of the money as you can, so you’re always right on the edge of what you can afford. And so it was with our relatively tight budget. In the very first draft of the pilot episode, I had written a gag involving a flypast by the Red Arrows. The executives loved that one — but it was going to be expensive. How were we intending to get that shot? Well, we got it. I won’t say how, but the Red Arrows moment is one of my favourites. I also wrote in the script that Lance drives a yellow Triumph TR7. I assumed that I would have to compromise on this one. But Sam Harley, our designer, found a 1977 yellow TR7 in pristine condition . . . and it was cheaper to buy it than hire it for the duration of the shoot. This left the problem of what would happen to it after we finished. I bought it. I told my wife that I had to safeguard it in case we were commissioned for a second series. So now I have a TR7 in a colour that could only be described as ‘yellow’. If we do get another series, I might write in that Andy flies a helicopter a bit like Blue Thunder. So what kind of programme is this? A sitcom? A comedy drama? A romantic comedy? To be honest, I’m not sure. I only know I’m pleased with it. It’s a love song to the British countryside, to people, and their passions and pastimes. There’s some swearing, like in real life, but no celebrities or car chases, like in real life. Lots of birdsong. A frog. A yellow TR7. I’ve been allowed to make the television show that I would want to watch. I hope you want to watch it, too.

"Katie Hopkins earns her living off her acid tongue - hundreds of thousands of hapless Brits have been hung out to dry for their choice in children's names of size of waistband since she shot to fame on The Apprentice. But for the first time ever, the social commentator was unusually caring and compassionate as she appeared on This Morning alongside Christina Briggs - the 25-stone mother who has called on the government to pay her to lose weight. The pair sat arm-in-arm on the ITV programme's sofa with presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden, with Katie even proclaiming Twitter war on people who have attacked Christina on the internet since her comments were first published. Katie Hopkins (right) showed a sympathetic side for the first time when she appeared on This Morning today with 25-stone Christina Briggs, who wants help from the government to lose weight . Katie admitted that her new weight gain - almost four stone in three months - has made her much more sympathetic to large people. She said: 'I understand, I only put on half my body weight, but I understand about this thing of getting to the front door and people calling you names. 'It hasn't changed my view, I stand by everything I said - I still wouldn't employ a fat person. 'Looking at myself after a few months (putting on weight), I wouldn't employ me either as it's hard on your knees, on your health, even hard to breathe. Mother-of-two Christina complained that junk food is much cheaper than healthy food . 'But I also see the abuse and aggression directed on Twitter for (Christina), I also see someone with this body mass where it must be hard to deal with all of that weight. 'I can see that I learned some big things when I put on weight, that it's hard.' Christina, 26, from Wigan hit the headlines this week after she complained that she needed more taxpayers' money than her £15,000-a-year benefits in order to overhaul her unhealthy lifestyle. The mother-of-two believes that she can't lose weight because she can only afford junk food and doesn't have the funds to pay for a gym. Speaking on This Morning for the first time since she prompted a nationwide backlash for her comments in this week's Closer magazine, Christina said she could understand why people were so annoyed with her demands. She said: 'I understand the outrage, I do get benefits paid for me but I have a daughter with ADHD and I help a lot as a carer for my brother as well. 'The only thing I can control is what I eat because comfort food is better than going out and letting people bully me.' Katie Hopkins sat arm-in-arm with Christina Briggs throughout the This Morning interview with Philip Schofield and Amanda Holden (left) 'I go to the door and get ready for a run, but then I just turn back and go inside - I think that if I go for a run down the street, people will laugh at me. 'I don't want (weight-loss) surgery, I want to prove to my kids that I can do it myself, the price of gym should be lowered.' Whereas in the past, Katie would have argued against these comments, the mother-of-three was surprisingly understanding of Christina's reluctance to exercise. The new issue of Closer with Christina's interview is out now . She said: 'I used to say, for goodness sake, put trainers on and go for a run. 'But there is a large population of obese people who are invisible because they don't want to go out. 'Sometimes you get to a point where you go to a doctor and they say your BMI is too high for help. 'Fat clubs, I call them that, but they would call themselves Slimming World or Weightwatchers, would also be less inclined to help because you're too large and it is too expensive to join those anyway. 'So the people who are joining me in my project to lose weight, we're trying to set up a way on Twitter of finding a way that works for us. 'So for example, (Christina) really loves swimming, so if she could find someone to buddy with then she'd feel safer because there are people there in case someone calls you names. 'Weight is much more of a mental issue than in your body.' The TV star also had a parting shot for all of the keyboard warriors who have been targeting Christina with hurtful comments over the web in the past 24 hours. She said: 'If you go on her, you take me on too.' See the full interview at www.itv.com/thismorning .","Christina Briggs hit headlines over complaints healthy food is too expensive .

"The victim of a glassing attack by soap opera actress Crystal Hunt has said the incident destroyed her chances of ever having a baby. Elizabeth Nam said 'Guiding Light' star Crystal Hunt caused her such distress when she smashed a pint glass in her face, she feels she has no hope of finding a relationship. According to court documents obtained by TMZ, Ms Nam says the attack that left her with cuts on her face has ruined her life. She says she had been 'actively searching for a mate,' before adding, 'the assault might have killed my future baby due to my biological clock ticking'. Given probation: Crystal Hunt (pictured), 29, a former Daytime Emmy Award nominee, has escaped prison after allegedly smashing a pint glass into another woman's face during a bar brawl in December 2013 . Hunt, 29, a former Daytime Emmy Award nominee, hurled the glass at the victim following an argument at Pearl's Liquor Bar in West Hollywood  on December 13, prosecutors told TMZ.

"An HIV 'wonder drug' could be made available on the NHS, in what has been hailed as the most significant breakthrough against the virus in a generation. A landmark trial in England is to be sped up after interim analysis of the the drug Truvada found it to be 'highly protective against HIV'. Campaigners have urged the NHS to offer the medication – which has been approved for use in the U.S. since 2012 – to vulnerable groups as soon as possible. A 'wonder drug' which can reduce the risk of contracting HIV by 92 per cent could be offered on the NHS, as a landmark trial into the drug's use could be sped up . U.S. guidelines say the tablet offers up to a 92 per cent reduction in the risk of contracting HIV - if taken every day. Truvada is a drug which provides 'pre-exposure prophylaxis' (PrEP). This involves giving antiretroviral drugs - usually prescribed to treat HIV - to people who don't have the virus but are at a high risk of exposure to it. NHS England have now set up a group looking into the viability offering Truvada on the NHS, as it is already known PrEP effectively protects against HIV. As part of the trial, Truvada was prescribed to 407 men taking part in a study in Brighton, London, York, Manchester, Birmingham and Sheffield. A further 138 men who were on the 'deferred arm' of the trial, originally due to receive the drug in a year's time, will now be offered it immediately. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is a way for people who do not have HIV but who are at substantial risk of getting it to prevent HIV infection by taking a pill every day. The pill (brand name Truvada) contains two medicines (tenofovir and emtricitabine) that are used in combination with other medicines to treat HIV. When someone is exposed to HIV through sex or injection drug use, these medicines can work to keep the virus from establishing a permanent infection. When taken consistently, PrEP has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection in people who are at high risk by up to 92per cent. PrEP is much less effective if it is not taken consistently. PrEP is a powerful HIV prevention tool and can be combined with condoms and other prevention methods to provide even greater protection than when used alone. But people who use PrEP must commit to taking the drug every day and seeing their health care provider for follow-up every three months. Source: Centres for Disease and Control Preventions . Lead researcher Dr Sheena McCormack, from the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, who led  the PROUD study told MailOnline: 'It’s the first HIV prevention trial of this scale that’s ever been done in the UK. 'To fast-track the trial is completely unexpected. When we started we didn't expect we would achieve a result in this number. 'We were just seeing if we could recruit enough men. 'This is a real key piece of evidence that the policy group will put forward to make the case for the drug to be available on the NHS. 'These are great results, but we really want to understand them. She added that a national trial could provide more information that would help NHS England make its decision. She said: 'The early adopters might be very good at taking the tablets . 'A national study might find people might not be so good at taking them. 'We need to look at how long people stay on it, do people carry on taking it?' She added: 'A HIV test only gives you the results for your status six weeks ago. So you could leave the clinic today with a HIV negative and be highly infectious. 'So PrEP has a key role for people in between HIV tests. 'It’s really exciting, and I’m not going to give up. You don’t do research if you don’t want it to be put into clinical practice.' The results of the trial will be published early next year and it is hoped that it could be rolled out nationally in 2017. The study includes HIV-negative gay and bisexual men and transgender women who reported having anal sex without condoms recently. All participants were offered regular testing for HIV and sexually transmitted infections, condoms and safer sex support. Researchers hope to answer questions such as  whether PrEP will lead to a reduction in the use of condoms and its impact on the spread of other sexually transmitted diseases. Truvada has been approved for use in the U.S. since 2012, and is recommended for groups at high risk of exposure to HIV, such as non-monogamous couples and people who inject drugs . Dr Rosemary Gillespie, Chief Executive at Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'This is potentially the most exciting development in HIV prevention in some years. 'For a trial to be fast-tracked in this way is rare, and shows just how much confidence researchers have in PrEP as a tool to reduce the spread of HIV. 'A number of questions remain unanswered, including how PrEP will be made available and who will be able to access it. 'The PROUD study has accelerated their part of the process. 'We will now be looking to the NHS to match that pace, and act swiftly to ensure those most at risk of HIV in the UK can access PrEP.' U.S. studied found participants who took TRuvada every day reduced their HIV infection risk by up to 92 per cent . Yusef Azad, director of policy and campaigns at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: 'The announcement that the PROUD study has already shown such a significant benefit in preventing HIV transmission is exciting and welcome news. 'HIV transmission in the UK remains far too high, especially among gay men, and we need to add to the prevention options available. These encouraging results provide powerful evidence that PrEP should be accessible to all who need it as soon as possible.' At the end of 2013, 35 million people were living with HIV, according to World Health Organisation statistics. In May this year, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. recommend that PrEP be considered for people who are HIV-negative and at substantial risk for HIV. This includes gay or bisexual men who have had unprotected sex in the last six months, men who do not regularly use condoms, someone in a relationship with a person who is HIV- positive and people who inject drugs. The decision followed from studies which found that taking Truvada daily reduced the risk of HIV by an average of 44 per cent when compared with a placebo. A quarter of participants who took Truvada every day reduced their HIV infection risk by 92 per cent compared with a placebo, although researchers warned this could be an overestimate, as people who took their drug many have also reduced the risk in other ways.","Trial of the  drug Truvada to be fast-tracked as results are promising .

"Willy Wonka eat your heart out, these marshmallow creations may be the most bizarre and inventive sweets we've seen all year. Including flavours such as strawberry with rose champagne and bacon with bourbon, these gourmet marshmallows are not your everyday sweet. The posh treats are created by Vivéltre, an independent sweet maker, and hand-made using 100% natural ingredients. Scroll down for video . A boutique sweet shop in Florida have created a range of inventive flavoured marshmallows . The flavour combinations are certainly not what you would expect to see in your local corner shop with 14 different varieties ranging from the Nutella to the luxurious 'French Riviera', flavoured with rose champagne and fresh strawberries. There is even a sweet treat inspired by the heated marshmallow, chocolate and cracker combination- the s'more. Made using vanilla marshmallow infused with chocolate chips and biscuits, it is all the flavour of the real deal minus the mess while camping. Irina Bromberry is the creative mind behind Vivéltre who started making the inventive marshmallows after she was encouraged to by her son. The unusual flavours include Nutella, the popular hazelnut spread . Irina Bromberry is the woman behind the gourmet sweets, her flavour combination are both inventive and sentimental, pictured here: left - whiskey orange flavour and right - Baileys . Two years after he asked her to make the fluffy sweets, Irina started Vivéltre from her home in Miami, Florida and she has been overwhelmed with the demand. Irina says that coming up with the different varieties is something very personal and can take up a lot of her time. 'I come up with the different flavours in all sorts of ways. Sometimes it's based on things that have sentimental value in my life - like the caramel and Nutella flavours - so I look for ways to integrate them into marshmallows.' Irina Bromberry (pictured) says that people refer to her as the dessert alchemist . Irina began creating the marshmallows for her son two years ago and has since turned her creativity into a successful business, pictured here- Chocolate ganache flavour . Once Irina has an idea for a new type of sweet she has a meticulous method of constructing the marshmallow, making sure the flavour balance is perfect. 'But other times I think of a flavour first and use complicated algorithms to find the perfect ratio of ingredients like I did with the Ultimate S'mores. 'They call me dessert alchemist around here.' Four months ago the company raised enough cash to launch via Kickstarter and hope to use their success to expand in to different treats. Irina has a meticulous process when getting the flavour balance right: pictured here, red velvet . Irina's marshmallows often include added texture to create an authentic flavour: pictured above, Caribbean rum coconut flavour .","Irina Bromberry has been creating the sweets for two years .

"A Mexican car park attendant who posted shocking pictures on Facebook of him holding what appeared to be a real gun at the head of his two-year-old nephew has been forced to apologize after the images went viral. Luis Martin Perez Rocha, 26, took the two images of him with his nephew at home in Cuajimalpa de Morelos, a borough of Mexico City, and then decided it would be amusing to upload them when he got to work. But neither social media users nor his bosses were impressed when the photos went viral, causing a storm of protest and forcing the man to issue a YouTube video apologizing for the act a few days later. Scroll down for video . Rocha caused a commotion on social media in Mexico after he posted this photo of him holding a very real looking toy gun to the head of his young nephew . The photos caused so much anger that for a short while on Twitter the hashtag from his employer #LordValetParking was a trending topic in Mexico as people signed in to find out as much as they could about the gunman. ‘Have you seen these images? Check his Facebook profile out, this is not a man, it is a monster,’ wrote one of the many critical posters. Another wrote: ‘The true face of a coward.’ Online users also quickly discovered that this wasn't the first time Rocha had done something like this. Rocha explained that he was only playing with his young nephew when he held a 'toy' gun to the boy's head, but many social media users didn't find the joke to be funny. 'The true face of a coward,' wrote one. Last summer he had uploaded a similar photograph in which he was aiming the same apparent toy gun at a woman. ‘Taking and uploading those images was a mistake. And I can confirm that it was only a toy gun and there were no consequences for the child as a result of the pictures,’ said Rocha in his apology video. ‘The young boy is my nephew who lives in the same house as me and we were playing. But I accept they were open to misinterpretation and I want to apologize through social networks to the netizens and also the authorities for my foolish action. ‘I have already contacted police and told them that the gun is a toy gun and I have offered to provide it if needed as proof of my claim.’","WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGE .

"Dallas Cowboys special teams player C.J. Spillman is under investigation but hasn't been arrested or charged after a report of an alleged sexual assault at the team hotel last month. Grapevine police spokesman Sgt. Robert Eberling said Wednesday night that the alleged assault took place early Sept. 20 at the Gaylord Texan Resort and Convention Center. The team flew to St. Louis later that Saturday, and Spillman played against the Rams the next day. Scroll down for video . Accused:  Dallas Cowboy's player C.J. Spillman (pictured here when he played for the of the San Francisco 49ers NFL football team) is being investigated for sexual assault at a hotel last month . Luxury hotel: Dallas Cowboys special teams player C.J. Spillman is under investigation but hasn't been arrested or charged after a report of an alleged sexual assault at the team hotel the Gaylord Texan Resort . He has played in all four games, including last weekend at home against New Orleans. His only tackle of the season came against the Rams. Spillman is listed as a safety but hasn't played defense this season. Spillman's agent, Ron Slavin, and attorney Bruce Ashworth declined to comment. The Cowboys didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Eberling said no other details were being released because the investigation is ongoing. The Cowboys signed the 28-year-old Spillman on Sept. 1, two days after the sixth-year player was among the final cuts by San Francisco. The former Louisville defensive back spent most of his first five seasons with the 49ers. The alleged assault came less than 24 hours after NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell held a news conference to address concerns about the way the league has handled domestic violence cases. 'Obviously, we see what's going on with the NFL, but these things are very sensitive in nature when it comes to the victim,' Eberling said. ""We don't release any details involving these type of crimes while they're under investigation.' Child abuse: Running back Adrian Peterson  #28 of the Minnesota Vikings was indicted in Texas on felony child-abuse charges for using a tree branch, or 'switch,' to discipline his 4-year-old son . Domestic abuse: Arizona Cardinals' Jonathan Dwye  allegedly head-butted his wife and broke her nose after she refused his sexual advances, and punched her in the face the next day . Goodell and the league were widely criticized over a two-game suspension for Baltimore running back Ray Rice after he knocked out his then-fiancee in a hotel elevator. The commissioner later acknowledged the punishment was too light and said future first offenses in domestic violence cases would result in six-game bans. When an explosive video surfaced showing Rice punching the woman, he was released by the Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the league. The NFL also has been rocked by a pair of assault cases last month that sidelined running backs Adrian Peterson in Minnesota and Jonathan Dwyer in Arizona. Peterson was indicted in Texas on felony child-abuse charges for using a tree branch, or 'switch,' to discipline his 4-year-old son. Dwyer won't play again this season after his arrest on aggravated assault charges. A law enforcement report says he head-butted his wife and broke her nose after she refused his sexual advances, and punched her in the face the next day. Peterson and Carolina defensive end Greg Hardy are on a paid leave through a special roster exemption granted by the league. Hardy is appealing his conviction in a domestic violence case involving an ex-girlfriend in North Carolina. San Francisco defensive lineman Ray McDonald is playing after he was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence at a home he shares with his fiancee.

"A television news anchor who ended up swearing on a live broadcast has apologized for his ill-timed rant and said his editor was to blame. Matt Pieper, who has since been fired from News 12 The Bronx in New York, was caught telling parents to 'do their f***ing jobs' live on air. He then continued to joke about it for several minutes while insulting anyone who relied on government assistance 'for their entire lives', without realizing his insensitive thoughts were being broadcast for everyone to see and hear. Incredibly, Mr Pieper then decided to shun responsibility for speaking out loud by blaming the workings of a busy TV newsroom and someone 'speaking in his ear' for his lack of judgement. On-air gaff: Matt Pieper from News 12 The Bronx said parents should 'do their f***ing jobs'while insulting anyone who was on government assistance last Wednesday morning . Going live: Amy Yensi laughs when she hears the gaff about school crossing guards with, also not realizing the cameras are rolling . Fired: Matt Pieper had a promising and successful career before his self-destruction in front of the cameras. He had been nominatied for an Emmy Award in the past . 'Someone in the control room spoke into my earpiece and asked me to relay a message to our reporter out in the field,' Mr Pieper explained on Twitter. 'These were not my own thoughts or profanities,' the news anchor insisted. 'In relaying that information, I made a poor decision in my choice of words and for that I apologize.' Mr Pieper went further still writing a grovelling apology on his Facebook profile. As a professional who has spent his entire career delivering the news, I understand the importance of sharing the facts.The incident was broadcast accidentally when we were supposed to be in a commercial break, not on the air. Someone in the control room spoke into my earpiece and asked me to relay a message to our reporter out in the field.' 'I could have communicated what I was asked to get across in a different manner and under the pressure of doing my job in real time I made a mistake.'

He will now have time to do this, face-to-face, rather than over the airwaves . In a Facebook apology, the station blamed a 'technical error' on the airing of the 'personal conversation' A story to tell: Matt Pieper has pleaded with friends on his Facebook profile for them to contact him if they want to know the 'full story' as to what happend . I have been a stalwart advocate for equality and diversity in the workplace, within my own family and in my community. I apologize to anyone I offended and assure you that this situation—which has cost me my job—was truly just a mistake in relaying a message, and not a representation of my views or character.' Pieper made the inflammatory comments last Wednesday morning during an embarrassing exchange with reporter Amy Yensi. Thinking it was a commercial break, Pieper was talking to  reporter Amy Yensi about an up-coming report on school crossing guards when he said: 'Two minutes and Dave [a colleague] wants you to talk about how parents should do their f***ing jobs and take their kids to school and not rely on everyone else, kind of like people who rely on government assistance for their entire lives.' The other reporter laughs at the joke before Pieper adds: 'It's true, I mean, how old are these kids?' The camera kept on recording while the anchor neatened up his tie, completely unaware that his insensitive commetns had been broadcast on air. Open-mouthed: Viewers were aghast at the words spoken by Matt Pieper and demanded an explanation .

"A teenage girl pulled off a feat most professional golfers can only dream off when she hit two holes in one during a single competition. Samantha Staudt, 16, was playing in a high school competition at the Inniscrone Golf Club in Avondale, Pennsylvania, when she hit the first hole-in-one on the fifth hole. The Coatsville Area High School junior, who has  never hit a hole in one before, told ABC6: 'I just hit it and it happened to be right at the pole and hit and spun and rolled three feet into the pole.' Samantha Staudt, 16, was playing in a high school competition at the Inniscrone Golf Club in Avondale, Pennsylvania, when she hit a staggering two hole-in-ones . Samantha continued the round playing against a boy from Avon Grove, but was confused when she couldn't find her ball on the eighth green. She said: 'I went up there and I didn't see anything. I guess it rolled off the front and I didn't see it. 'Then the guy from Avon Grove [High School] went up and looked in the cup and said, 'How am I supposed to compete with this? This is ridiculous!''' Unsurprisingly, the 16-year-old won the nine-hole round, finishing at 1-under-par 35. Samantha had never hit a hole in one until that day, when she hit two in the same round . 'I didn't even know what to do,' Samantha told philly.com. 'On the first one, we were going crazy, but I've never heard of anyone having two in one round.' She said that she didn't celebrate with her parents that night but she added: 'My parents are joking around about buying me a lottery ticket.'

"With everything from lions to popular superheroes on display, creative pet grooming is proof that art isn't limited to a canvas and paint. Or so Sue Eld-Weaver, the UK's top dog coiffeur, will tell you. A Northamptonshire mother-of-four, Mrs Eld-Weaver has won every competition the UK has to offer - with a little help from her pet poodle, Dobby. Now a new Channel 4 documentary takes you behind the scenes as she battles it out against top groomers from around the globe at the world's biggest dog grooming event in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Scroll down for video . Creative: The UK's top dog groomer Sue Eld-Weaver with her poodle, Dobby, in a Japanese-inspired look . The prize? A spot on the cover of Groomer to Groomer magazine, which, until now, has only ever featured American dogs on the cover. 'If you're going to do creative grooming, . being the UK champion is really nice, really sweet, but it's not really . much of a challenge,' explains Mrs Eld-Weaver. 'I want to be the best - to be up with the best.' And the competition is fierce. In the USA, dog grooming is a multi-billion dollar industry and winning at Hershey can transform a business. For Adriane Pope, a champion dog groomer and the owner of a canine condo in Conway, South Carolina, the rewards are obvious. 'People spend more money on their pets than they do on their children around here,' she explains, while pointing out some of the more unusual features of her deluxe dog hotel. Literary inspiration: Sue's Memoirs of a Geisha look included a bonsai tree tail, a waterfall and an orange fish . Competition: Sue went up against American groomers (L-R) Cindy Oliver, Adriane Pope and Cat Opson . 'We've got flat screen TVs, ceiling fans... there's furniture for the dogs and people can choose the channel for their dogs to watch. A lot of people request sports but some like the Cartoon Network.' Like Mrs Eld-Weaver, Pope is also planning to compete at Hershey and has dreamed up a Disney themed design for her dogs, Logan and Gucci. 'I reckon you could compare this to someone who sculpts things out of wood or concrete,' she adds of her passion for extreme dog styling. 'Picasso used a white blank piece of paper, I use a white dog. This is my canvas.' In Hershey, Mrs Eld-Weaver and Dobby have arrived after an eight hour flight from London, but they can't go to bed - there's still hours of preparation required before the poodle can appear in front of the judges. To win the Judge's Award, Dobby will need to be perfect, complete with a clean, fluffed-up coat, a flawless dye job and a haircut that Nicky Clarke would be proud of. Previous winner: American dog groomer Sandy Hartness' 2004 flower garden inspired design . Clever: Cat Opson, a groomer competing against Sue, entered this Sesame Street design in 2012 . Impressive: Dog groomer Lori Craig's Lion King effort took home the coveted trophy in 2009 . But not everything can be done beforehand: points are awarded for the transformation achieved in front of the judges, and most of the cutting work has to be done on stage in front of the Grooming Expo's 5,000 visitors. 'I have no idea what's going to happen,' reveals Ren Netherland, the show's official photographer. 'I . mean, I know what a poodle looks like but here, at a show like this, it . ain't a poodle anymore. It could be anything. Lions, camels... I've . seen buffalo. They're running out of animals!' Luckily for Mrs Eld-Weaver, Dobby's design has little to do with the animal kingdom and everything to do with the literary world. 'Dobby's design is Memoirs of a Geisha,' she explains. 'There's quite a lot involved. If I mess it up in any way, it's like anything else - you get sent home.' To win, she has to impress judges Teri DiMarino, Kathy Rose and Dawn Omboy, all of whom were once champion groomers in their own right. Looks familiar: Angela Kumpe's impressive Madagascar inspired look narrowly missed out on the top prize . Clever: Karen Stickle's Panda Bear was narrowly beaten by Lori Craig's Lion King effort in 2009 . 'There's more to it than putting colour . and a couple of patterns on a dog,' insists Teri. 'It's still dog grooming. I want to . see a well-groomed dog and a well-prepared dog.' By the time showtime arrives, Mrs Eld-Weaver is thoroughly nervous. 'I feel sick,' she quavers. 'There's so much pressure today!' But despite her nerves, her Memoirs of a Geisha design goes on to see off competition from dogs done up as Batman, the Simpsons and Donald Duck, and Dobby becomes the first British dog ever to win the prestigious prize. Backstage, a thrilled Mrs Eld-Weaver can't contain her emotion. 'Being able to accept yourself, trust yourself, believe in yourself - that's what I'm finally getting to do,' she says. 'I've gone up against some of the best in the world and proved myself against them.' Doggy Styling airs at 9pm on Monday 30th December on Channel 4 . May the force be with you!

"The man who has been charged with starting a fire that led to the cancellation of 2,000 flights and ongoing delays wrote a cryptic message on his Facebook moments before torching a control tower. Brian Howard, 36, of Naperville, Illinois, said he was going to take his own life and apologized to his family for the mess he had made, then ended by saying he was going to 'smoke this blunt and move on.' But the disruption has caused widespread flight delays and affected thousands of passengers' travel plans as airlines scramble to accommodate travelers whose flights were canceled or delayed. Scroll down for video . Delayed: Airline agents attempt to assist passengers with their travel plans after flights were delayed or cancelled at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, after the fire . Reschedule: Travelers wait on line to book and reschedule travel plans after the flight chaos . Long wait: Kelsey Stephenson of Los Angeles and her dog, Daisy were stranded when their flight home was canceled after the small fire at the Air Route Traffic Control Center in Aurora disrupted air service . The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently trying to determine the extent of the damage and when air traffic will return to normal. The fire stopped all traffic in and out of O'Hare and Midway airports and delays and cancellations caused travel chaos for travelers from around the country. After the widespread disruption  flights began running after five-hours but planes were moving at a slower pace. Questions have been raised about how the FAA has coped in order to keep planes moving after the fire. The FAA said Friday that it was managing the Aurora facility's traffic through centers in Cleveland, Indianapolis, Kansas City and Minneapolis. The agency said it would continue to work with those centers over the weekend to reduce disruptions. Line: Travelers wait on line to book and reschedule travel plans after the flight delays . Briefing: Police have revealed that Brian Howard, 36, of Naperville, Illinois, has been arrested after the  fire at an air traffic control center . Chaos: All flights into and out of Chicago's O'Hare and Midway international airports were grounded early on Friday - along with any scheduled to cross the Midwest - after a fire broke out in the basement of the Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center in Aurora, about 40 miles west of downtown Chicago . Cancelled: A look at the schedule board in Chicago . After the incident, paramedics found Howard and law enforcement officials were able to put out the fire and save his life when they arrived on the scene. 'Take a hard look in the mirror, I have. And this is why I am about to take out ZAU (the control center) and my life,' the Facebook message said, according to an FBI special agent’s comments in an affidavit obtained by CBS Chicago. 'April, Pop, luv you guys and I am sorry. Leaving you with a big mess. Do your best to move on quickly from me please. Feel like I give a [expletive] for the first time in a long time again … but not for too long (haha!) So I’m gonna smoke this blunt and move on, take care everyone.' There were no indications that the fire was an act of terrorism. One person at the control center was treated for smoke inhalation. Stranded: Over 2,000 flights were cancelled Friday, leaving large crowds standing around with not much to do (above) On the scene: FBI and police spent all day working together . Dazed: Employees at a Chicago airport hang out in the parking lot (above) Howard was charged with one felony count of destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities on Friday afternoon. He had worked at the facility in Aurora for eight years, but was recently told that he was being transferred to Hawaii. It is unknown if this is what led him to light the fire and attempt to take his own life. And while flights begun to resume after a delay of about four hours, the repercussions of this fire have caused travel problems throughout the weekend. Howard remains hospitalized and no court date has been set, prosecutors said. Frenzy: FBI, police and news teams outside Howard's Naperville apartment (above) Home: A look at Howard's apartment (above) Clues: The FBI goes through a car (above) near the Aurora air traffic control center . He would face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted on the charge. The incident caused major delays at O'Hare and the domestic hub Midway International Airport, affecting flights from almost every state and routes with Europe, Asia and Latin America. 'There's cascading delays because nothing can take off bound for Chicago from anywhere,' said Doug Church, spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, a union of air traffic controllers. 'The impact is national and major.' Still going: Flight problems continued all weekend . At O'Hare, passengers were scrambling to find alternative transportation or bracing for long delays. 'I'm shocked at how calm everyone is. With everything going on in the world, maybe we're all managing our expectations. It's a fire in Aurora, it's not ISIS,' said Cynthia Stemler of the Chicago suburb of Lake Bluff, who was heading to Newark, New Jersey. The FAA is still assessing the damage, which may be significant, but the agency hopes to restore air traffic to relatively normal levels over the next few days, they said.

"Another run-in: Controversial politiican Eric Joyce has been arrested for the fourth time in three years . Controversial MP Eric Joyce has been arrested for the fourth time in three years - but insists he was trying to stop a 14-year-old vandal smashing up a shop. Mr Joyce spoke out about the incident today on his website after a wave of interest was prompted by his arrest being revealed in the House of Commons. He said he was next to a damaged shop in Camden, north London, just before 10pm on October 17 when he detained the boy he believed responsible - who then told police he had been assaulted by the MP. Officers had reports of a 'fight' and arrested both the 14-year-old boy, on suspicion of possessing cannabis, and the 54-year-old MP on suspicion of actual bodily harm. They are still investigating. Mr Joyce wrote on his website: 'I detained a youth in a shop in London. Damage had been done to the store. 'I asked the shopkeeper to call the police, and when officers arrived they arrested the youth and informed me that drugs had been recovered from the scene. 'The officers also informed me that the youth had immediately made a complaint that I had assaulted him by detaining him. 'I was questioned by the police and told that because of my identity the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Metropolitan Police Press Office would be informed of the incident. 'I understand the Metropolitan Police has now made the matter public. I will make no further comment for now, other than to say a) that no alcohol was involved and b) I am not in the habit of summoning the police if I feel that I am in the wrong.' The Metropolitan Police revealed the arrest after writing to House speaker John Bercow on October 21, according to an entry in the Commons records. A force spokesman said: 'Police in Camden were called to a convenience store in Chalk Farm Parade, Adelaide Road, NW3 at 2142hrs on Friday, 17 October following reports of a fight. 'Upon arrival officers found a man and two teenage boys involved in an altercation. Scene: The incident happened on this shopping parade next to Chalk Farm tube station in north London . Shop: The MP offered his account of what happened at this shop - and said he was the one who called police . 'A 54-year-old man was subsequently arrested on suspicion of ABH. 'A 14-year-old boy [B] was also arrested at the scene for possession of cannabis. 'Both were taken to a central London police station for questioning and have since been bailed to a date in early December pending further enquiries. Neither required medical treatment. 'Police in Camden are investigating and enquiries continue.' In March Mr Joyce said he was considering his future as a politician after he admitted calling an Afro-Caribbean baggage handler 'f****** fat and black'. Destruction: The scene in the shop after the incident . The 54-year-old, who was thrown out of the Labour party after a brawl in a House of Commons bar, was drunk by the time he landed at Edinburgh Airport and hurled abuse at staff on May 19 last year. After Mr Joyce was fined £1,500 for the airport incident he insisted he did not have a drinking problem - but said he will 'reflect' on whether he will remain in Westminster. The MP will not be automatically disqualified from the Commons - that is only possible if MPs are jailed for a year or more. He had been drinking on an evening flight from Heathrow to the Scottish capital last May, realising later that he left his phone on board, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard today. He asked airport baggage handlers for help but became abusive when they asked for flight details. Police officers became involved, but he continued to hurl insults. Joyce repeatedly called a baggage handler and officers 'fat, f****** w*****s' and goaded officers to 'f****** arrest me'. He also referred to an officer of Afro-Caribbean origin as 'f****** fat and black'. Joyce began to 'flail his arms' when one officer attempted to put him in handcuffs, and he continued to resist until he was restrained on the floor. Sheriff Frank Crowe described his actions as a 'deeply unfortunate, prolonged, drink-fuelled rant'. History: MP Eric Joyce is flanked by police officers as he leaves Westminster Magistrates' Court in 2012 . CONVICTED: FEBRUARY 2012 . Joyce was convicted of assault after assaulting four people in Strangers Bar on February 22, 2012. He was fined £3,000, handed a curfew and banned from pubs for three months. ARRESTED: MARCH 2013 . Joyce arrested after reports of another scuffle in a House of Commons bar on March 14, 2013, but police decide there is insufficient evidence to bring any charges. CONVICTED: MAY 2013 . Joyce was convicted of a breach of the peace and fined £1,500 after hurling abuse at Edinburgh Airport staff on May 19, 2013. Court hears he called police officer of Afro-Caribbean origin 'f****** fat and black'. 'At least you have taken this opportunity to apologise,' the sheriff said. As well as imposing a fine, the sheriff ordered Joyce to pay £100 compensation to airport staff and £50 to the police officer he racially insulted. Joyce became an independent MP after he was expelled from the Labour Party following his conviction for assaulting politicians in a House of Commons bar in 2012. The former Army major was fined £3,000 and banned from pubs for three months following the brawl in the Strangers' Bar. Joyce's arrival at Westminster in 2000 came shortly after he quit the Army, making claims of snobbery, sexism and racism in the armed forces. He was elected to Parliament as Labour MP for Falkirk West in a by-election. He increased his majority in the general elections of 2001 and 2005 when the constituency was renamed Falkirk after constituency changes, and held on by a comfortable margin in 2010. The selection of his replacement as Labour candidate in Falkirk became emroiled in a major scandal amid claims of vote-rigging.

"One speed camera near a Brooklyn high school generated over $77,500 in fines against speeding motorists on a single day in July. The camera is mounted near Abraham Lincoln High School according to the Washington Post, and generated speeding tickets for 1,551 drivers going more than 10 miles an hour over the limit. A speeding violation is sent to the offender 30 days after the incident is recorded and the fine totals $50. Gotcha: City councilmen Chaim Deutsch and Mark Treyger have conflicting views of the usefulness of the current placement of the speed camera, which is near the exit ramp on the right . Sheepshead Bites, a local blog, said councilman Chaim Deutsch originally claimed that 6,000 violations were recorded on a peak day for that camera and that it would encourage safer driving. The Department of Transportation later released the actual numbers for the peak day, which occurred on July 7. The camera has been a thorn in the side for another councilman, Mark Treyger, who wants them moved farther down from the parkway exit ramp. Cameras 'should not be placed in locations like the start of an exit ramp because this ‘gotcha’ location plays into fears of many that these cameras are solely revenue generating machines,' said Treyger. The New York State Legislature approved the use of cameras in New York City at the end of 2013, with over 20 currently deployed throughout the boroughs, all within a quarter mile of schools. A study released by the Department of Transportation claimed that speed cameras reduced fatalities 40 to 45 percent in areas where they were deployed. The New York Times reports that in 2013, there were an estimated 286 traffic fatalities in the city.

"Charges: Former New York Giants offensive lineman Lucas 'Luke' Petitgout was arrested Tuesday on a charge of sexual assault in Bergen County, according to county records . Former New York Giants and Tampa Bay Buccaneers player Luke Petitgout has been charged with assault and sexual assault in New Jersey after alleged attack. Petitgout's attorney, Patrick J. Jennings, said Tuesday the allegations are baseless and he intends to vigorously defend the former offensive lineman. Petitgout was arrested in Woodcliff around 6 a.m. yesterday morning and was being held on $50,000 bail in the Bergen County jail. The charges were filed in Pascack Joint Municipal Court on Tuesday. The 38-year-old had just come from a Giants reunion when the attack allegedly took place. It is believed that were witnesses who saw what happened and they may now be called to testify should the charges stand. Petitgout was later charged with sexual assault with force and simple assault. He was also ordered to be held on $50,000 bail, Bergen County jailhouse records show. Petitgout had a misdemeanor harassment case against him dropped in New York last year after his wife accused him of hitting her. On that occasion he was accused of roughing up his wife Jennifer after a night out in the Meatpacking District but the case was thrown out because the charges could not be proven. He allegedly hit her in the head and threw her out of the car on their wedding anniversary after the couple had been celebrating. Petitgout played college football for the University of Notre Dame. As a pro, the tackle played for the Giants for eight years, and spent the last season of his career playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Petitgout retired in 2007 . She was treated at New York Downtown Hospital for bruises following the attack. Cops say she told them she 'feared for her life.' Petigout was charged with misdemeanor assault but Jennifer dropped the charges against her 6-foot-6, 310 pound husband. In June he was again arrested for allegedly punching a clubgoer inside Rockefeller Center.

"It is the perfect time of year to spot the Aurora Borealis in Iceland. But holidaymakers heading north could be in for a double treat this year thanks to its erupting volcano. The Bardarbunga eruption began in August, prompting spectacular images of the molten lava. But one photographer has gone a step further and captured the volcano glowing by night as the Northern Lights put on a celestial display above. Now holiday company Off The Map Travel, which snapped the spectacular picture, says this could be the perfect winter to catch both the Aurora Borealis and see a volcanic eruption up-close. Jonny Cooper, Northern Lights expert and founder of Off the Map Travel said: 'This is a truly spectacular night time display of colour with the glow of the emerging lava being framed by the Northern Lights.' 'Although it is unclear how long the volcano will continue to flow, there is a genuine opportunity for those who visit in October to witness this incredible event.' 'With such a strong start to the year for the Northern Lights, the combination of the eruption and such strong aurora displays may not be seen again for a long time,' he added.

"Disgraced: Molly Shattuck, 47, was indicted on Monday on two counts of third-degree rape, four counts of unlawful sexual contact and three counts of providing alcohol to minors . The inappropriate sexual relationship between Molly Shattuck, the 47-year-old former Baltimore Ravens cheerleader, and a 15-year-old boy which has lead to the mother-of-three being charged with third-degree rape was  instigated by her own son, police have revealed. According to Delaware State Police, it was one of Shattuck’s own children who urged the unnamed victim to text his mom because ‘she is obsessed with you’ after spotting photos of the teen on Instagram. Disgraced Shattuck was indicted on Monday on two counts of third-degree rape, four counts of unlawful sexual contact and three counts of providing alcohol to minors. She was released on $84,000 bond after an arraignment on Wednesday at Sussex County Superior Court in Georgetown, Delaware. The ill-feted relationship had begun at the end of May when Shattuck - the estranged wife of billionaire businessman Mayo Shattuck III - commented on a photo of the teen on Instagram. The victim replied with a private message of thanks, but Shattuck's son then forwarded his mother's cell phone number, saying, ‘You should text my Mom, she is obsessed with you,’ according to court records. The pair first met a month later while the teen was visiting a friend in her neighborhood, reports DelawareOnline. Scroll down for video . The inappropriate sexual relationship between Molly Shattuck, the 47-year-old former Baltimore Ravens cheerleader, and a 15-year-old boy which led to the mother-of-three being charged with third-degree rape was in fact instigated by her son, police have revealed. Above Shattuck is pictured with her estranged husband Mayo and their three children . The meeting ended with a hug but no other physical contact between the 47-year-old mom and 15-year-old boy, court records said. Things soon moved up a gear as the pair started to meet for regular private trysts in Shattuck’s Cadillac Escalade. Court records show that a meeting at an AMC movie theater followed by another in a school parking lot. During July, Shattuck picked the teenager up from summer school ‘five or six times’ at lunchtime and they would ‘talk and eat and then get in the back of the car and kiss or make out,’ police said. It was during one of these incidents that Shattuck allegedly touched the teenager's penis. ‘Between their encounters, Shattuck asked for pictures via text message’ and he would send pictures of himself shirtless and one in his underwear, the victim told police. The Baltimore native became the oldest NFL cheerleader in history when she cheered for the Ravens in 2005 . For Labor Day weekend Shattuck rented this beach house in Bethany Beach where she is alleged to have plied her 15-year-old victim with beer before performing oral sex on him at least twice . A holiday to remember? Shattuck tweeted about her trip to Bethany Beach over the Labor Day weekend . For Labor Day weekend Shattuck took her children and some of their friends - including the victim - to stay at a rented beach house in Bethany Beach. 'Sometime around 2 a.m. Sunday morning, they drove to a liquor store and (Molly) Shattuck purchased a 12-pack of Miller Lite and a 12-pack of Bud Light for them,' state the court documents. Once back at the house, Shattuck is alleged to have performed oral sex on the boy at least twice - first outside the home while walking the dog and then again in her bedroom. The documents state '(the boy) described the undergarments (Molly) Shattuck was wearing when he entered her bedroom.' Shattuck is alleged to told the boy 'if he wanted to have sex she would. The boy opted out. He decided to leave. At that point, she told him to come back later but he did not go back.' The next day the boy's father collected him. Shattuck was released on $84,000 bond after an arraignment on Wednesday at Sussex County Superior Court in Georgetown, Delaware . Molly Shattuck is separated from billionaire business executive Mayo Shattuck III, 60, the current chairman of energy provider Exelon . Shattuck is also alleged to have sent the teen pictures through Instagram of him taken at the beach over the Labor Day weekend. On September 26, the boy's family reported Shattuck to the police who executed a search warrant at her $2.5 million home on October 1. The search warrant led investigators to seize her cell phone and her computer. Detectives also specifically sought a pink lace bra and panties that the victim described her as wearing in the bedroom of her beach house. The grand jury indictment against Shattuck reveals that the two counts of rape in the third degree are for 'putting her mouth on his penis.' There four counts of unlawful sexual contact in the second degree are 'touching his penis,' causing or allowing the teen to 'touch her breasts with his mouth,' causing or allowing the teen to 'touch her vagina with his hand,' and for causing or allowing the teen to 'touch her vagina with his penis.' The three counts of providing alcohol to minors are for providing alcohol to three different minors. Shattuck is also a fitness consultant and advocate and published a book in February called Vibrant Living . Shattuck is separated from Mayo Shattuck III, 60, the billionaire former CEO of Baltimore-based Constellation Energy Nuclear Group and the current chairman of Chicago-based Exelon Corp., also an energy provider. The couple have three children - Spencer, 15, Lillian, 11, and Wyatt, 8. 'This is a difficult situation for everyone involved,' her lawyers told DelawareOnline. In 2005, Baltimore native Shattuck became the oldest NFL cheerleader in history up to that time when the Ravens selected her for the squad on her first tryout. She cheered for two years and was a part-time coach for six more years. Police executed a search warrant at Molly Shattuck's $2.5 million five-bedroom, 5.5-bathroom Maryland home on October 1 . Shattuck is also a fitness consultant and advocate, who published a book in February called Vibrant Living. According to her website, which is currently in 'maintenance mode', she has implemented a 21-day plan for health and improved living with people, companies and groups across the U.S. for the past several years.

"Many women are understandably anxious about starting to breastfeed. But Chloe Pullen admits she was slightly more worried than most, after her daughter Rose was born with two fully formed front teeth. Most babies start teething at around six months, but Rose astounded nurses and midwives at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff with her pearly white incisors. Scroll down for video . Rose Pullen, 25, woke up from a Caesarean to find her newborn daughter Rose Esme was born with two fully-formed white incisors on her lower gum . Rose Esme was born with two teeth - but they were removed when she was three days old in case she choked on them . Mrs Pullen, 25, from Pantmawr in Powys, Wales had a Caesarean so was under general anaesthetic for her daughter's birth. When she came round, her husband Daniel told her their daughter had been born with teeth. She said: 'The midwives had never seen a baby with teeth before. 'Everybody came to the ward to see her – you could tell it was rare,' she told Wales Online. Teeth that a child is born with are known as natal teeth. Doctors say they occur in about one in every 2,000 to 3,000 babies. They usually develop in the lower gums and have little root structure, meaning they are often wobbly. Mrs Pullen, who also has a two-year-old son Thomas, said she and her husband were so surprised by their daughter's appearance that they sent a picture of them to their friends and family. She said the incisors looked like normal teeth, only smaller. And luckily, breastfeeding didn't hurt as much as she had expected. 'I was worried about breastfeeding her but it didn't hurt,' she said. 'I could not actually feel her teeth.' It turned out that Rose is not the first baby in the family to be born with gnashers - the family later learned her grandmother was also born with one front tooth. Rose's teeth, which were in the middle of her lower gum, were removed three days after she was born . This is often the case with natal teeth  because if they are loose there is a danger of the child choking on them. They can also injure the baby's tongue when it is breastfeeding and can cause a breastfeeding mother pain. Rose had to be fed with bottled milk until the teeth were removed, but Mrs Pullen could resume breastfeeding again after that. She is still expected to grow a full set of baby teeth. Her mother added: 'I was given a little toothfairy box at her baby shower and I never thought I would be using it so soon - especially for Rose before her older brother Thomas.' Teeth that a child is born with are known as natal teeth. They occur in about one in every 2,000 to 3,000 babies. They usually develop in the lower gums and have little root structure meaning they are often wobbly. They are not usually well formed but can injure the baby's tongue when it is breastfeeding and can cause a breastfeeding mother pain. Natal teeth are often removed shortly after a baby is born because if they are loose there is a danger of the child choking on them. These teeth are not usually associated with any other medical problems. There is no known explanation for them other than that a child is more dentally developed. 'I was given a little toothfairy box at her baby shower and I never thought I would be using it so soon' said Mrs Pullen, who decided to keep daughter Rose's teeth in a jar as a souvenir .","Chloe Pullen woke up from Caesarean to be told her daughter had two teeth .

"A man who fathered 26 children by 15 different women is to win £1,000 compensation from public money because his local council can't find him a big enough house. Peter Rolfe, 64, who appeared on Channel 5's Benefits Britain, has been living in a three-bedroom house in Newport, Isle of Wight, with seven of his children for the past three years. Mr Rolfe, who has 14 daughters and 12 sons, was branded 'Britain's most feckless father' by former Tory MP Anne Widdecombe after he appeared on the reality TV show. Scroll down for video . Father of 26 Peter Rolfe, with some of his family, may get compensation for not getting a bigger council home . Mr Rolfe, 64, who suffers arthritis and diabetes, walks with a stick and has one eye, says he needs more space . The father of 14 girls and 12 boys aged three to 40 says his current three bed home, above, is too small for him . He claims £32,678 a year in benefits in the form of child tax credits, family allowance, disability benefits, housing benefits and a state pension, but now he is set to claim even more after the Local Government Ombudsman ruled that his local council had failed him. It declared that Isle of Wight Council had failed in its duty to find one-eyed Mr Rolfe, who walks with a stick, a bigger house for his family to live in. Now councillors must meet to decide whether to pay him £1,000 compensation, having previously agreed on a figure of £250. Mr Rolfe, who suffers from arthritis and diabetes, said: 'My kids are suffering because they've got no space. 'The council is not doing enough to find us another house, even though the ombudsman said it was in the wrong. 'We have been waiting years for a bigger house - I'll be dead before they even think about giving me one. '£1,000 would help immensely: any money is a help.' Angry: Mr Rolfe, who is unmarried, said: 'My kids are suffering because they've got no space' Mr Rofle, pictured back, with stick, is now in line to receive compensation from Isle of Wight council . When Benefits Britain was screened earlier this year, none of Mr Rolfe's children, who range in age from three to 40, was in employment. But their father, who is unmarried, and claims he is stopped in the street to give autographs, is unrepentant. He said: 'Some people slag me off for claiming benefits but I am not on the dole.  I am a pensioner. 'Most of the country are on benefits.' A spokesman for Isle of Wight Council said a decision on whether the council would pay the £1,000 would be taken at a meeting of the council executive 'in the near future'. They said that the council was 'working within its own policies' and added: 'We are continuing efforts to identify accommodation large enough for the family. 'The council has been exploring a number of options, including identifying two properties next to each other which could be reconfigured. To date no suitable accommodation has been found.'","Peter Rolfe, 64, of Newport, Isle of Wight, has 14 daughters and 12 sons .

"The European Union was today accused of misspending up to £7billion, just days after demanding Britain hand over an extra £1.7billion as the price for economic growth. Auditors demanded ‘more careful management and control’ of taxpayers’ money, warning up to 5.9 per cent of the £116billion budget could have been spent in breach of EU rules. Tory MPs condemned the ‘breathtaking hypocrisy’ at a time when David Cameron is refusing to meet the demand for £1.7billion by December 1, on top of the £8billion-a-year it already pays. David Cameron has called for spending restraint from Brussels and refused to pay an extra £1.7billion by December 1, but European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has criticised the Prime Minister's 'behaviour' Of 1,200 sample cases investigated by the auditors, irregularities were found in around 40 per cent. Bungling Brussels officials were found to have paid a Sardinian artichoke grower subsidies not to use damaging pesticides, which he continued to use. Render rules for a German airport contract were broken while Scottish farmers were given EU subsidies while not meeting rules for the notification of movement of livestock. The European Court of Auditors found money was wrongly spent across all of the EU’s 28 member states. In the 1,200 or so sample cases tracked by auditors, they found irregularities of some kind in over 40 percent - including over half of those in the biggest parts of the budget, devoted to the likes of regional infrastructure and farm subsidies. Court of Auditors President Vitor Caldeira said: ‘There has to be more careful management and control of EU funds. ‘If European Union citizens do not have a clear perception of the added value of EU spending, we will not have their trust.’ Tory MP Peter Bone said: “For the EU to demand £1.7 billion from us on December 1 is laughable especially when vast sums – far greater than that – are misspent every year by Brussels. “They need to put their house in order before making these ridiculous demands of the British people. It is breathtaking hypocrisy at a time when they cannot even run their own affairs,’ he told The Telegraph. Britain is locked in intense negotiations with the European Commission about the demand for an extra £1,7billion, which caught Mr Cameron off guard at a summit last month. The European Commission used rules dating back to 1995 and found Britain's economy has grown faster than expected, so must pay a greater share to Brussels. To add insult to injury, France will receive a £790million rebate because its economy is struggling. Bizarrely, Germany is also in line for a rebate while countries like Greece and Italy must pay more. Mr Cameron angrily insisted he will not bow to the demands, declaring: 'I am not paying that bill on December 1. If people think I am, they have got another thing coming. It is not going to happen.' Britain has been told to pay £1.7billion by December 1, on top of the £8billion-a-year it already pays. France, Germany and Denmark are among those told they will get money back from Brussels . Last night Jean-Claude Juncker, the new Commission President, hit out the Prime Minister’s behaviour. Mr Juncker criticised the leaders of Britain and Italy for making critical comments about the EU after both countries were landed with huge cash demands. Matteo Renzi, the Italian premier, was also highly critical of EU civil servants after the meeting. Speaking in the European Parliament yesterday, Mr Juncker said: 'I didn't like the way several prime ministers were behaving after the European Council. 'For a long period of time I've taken notes and I was always comparing what is said in the room and what is said outside the room. And from time to time it happens that the notes are not coinciding.' Mr Cameron tried to block Mr Juncker, a former Luxembourg PM and arch-federalist, from taking the senior EU post. Mr Juncker described the way Mr Cameron was presenting the EU cash demand issue as 'not correct'. 'They are presented in a totally different way in parts of British public opinion,' Mr Juncker said, pointing out that the rules of the EU should be better respected. Mr Renzi had complained that the EU was overtly bureaucratic. At one point he warned that he would make public the cost of EU 'palaces' in a row over Italy's budget projections. Yesterday Mr Juncker responded: 'I have to tell my good friend Matteo Renzi that I am not the chairman of a gang of bureaucrats... I am the president of the European Commission which is a political body.'","Report found up to 5.9% of £116billion budget could have broken rules .

Miss Alamuddin, 36, is a British humanitarian lawyer and was once voted the 'hottest barrister in London'. Her clients have included Wikileaks founder Julian Assange . She and Clooney have enjoyed a string of exotic holidays together in the past seven months. She comes from a prominent intellectual Lebanese family who fled war-torn Beirut when she was a child and settled in a large modern house in Buckinghamshire. Her mother, Baria, was a noted beauty when she was younger - a Liz Taylor of Lebanon, by all accounts. Her father, Ramzi, is a retired professor of business studies at the American University of Beirut. Clooney was married to actress Talia Balsam from 1989 to 1993. Since then he has said that although he is not completely closed off to the idea of another wedding, he is not the marrying type. Last December he told Esquire: ‘I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever. I was married in 1989. I wasn’t very good at it.’ His previous girlfriends include British model Lisa Snowdon, former wrestler Stacy Keibler, cocktail waitress Sarah Larson, Italian actress Elisabetta Canalis and Baywatch star Krista Allen.","Amal Alamuddin has a seven-carat diamond and platinum engagement ring .

"A part-time snowplow driver was convicted Wednesday of luring a prep-school teacher out of her Vermont home under the guise of a broken down car and then killed her. A jury rejected arguments by Allen Prue's defense that his wife, Patricia Prue, killed 33-year-old Melissa Jenkins in a jealous rage on March 25, 2012. Prosecutors said the Prues lured Jenkins from her home as part of a long-planned crime. Jenkins' nude body was found the next day in the Connecticut River. She had been strangled. Convicted: Allen Prue weeps in court on Wednesday after being found guilty of first-degree murder and two other charges in the 2012 slaying of Melissa Jenkins in Burlington, Vermont . Weak: Allen's attorneys had claimed he has an IQ of 75 and was easily manipulated by his wife, who they alleged was the murderer. They claimed Prue had no idea of her plan to kill Jenkins, who she was jealous of . Murdered: Melissa Jenkins, 33, a single mom and schoolteacher, was lured by the couple with a ruse of a broken down car. She was strangled to death and dumped in the Connecticut River . Prosecutor Lisa Warren shows the jury a shoe that belonged to Melissa Jenkins, that was found at the scene of her abduction, as she makes her closing statement in the trial of Allen Prue at Vermont Superior Court in on Tuesday, October 21, 2014, as Allen Prue (right) watches on . Patricia Prue, the wife Allen Prue, takes the stand during his murder trial in Vermont Superior Court on Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2014. She will be tried separately for the murder of Melissa Jenkins . Allen Prue, 32, cried when the jury's verdict was announced after six hours of deliberations. His lawyer had argued his client was unaware of his wife's plan to kill Jenkins. Allen Prue was convicted of first-degree murder, conspiracy and attempted kidnapping in the death of Jenkins, a teacher at St. Johnsbury Academy. Patricia Prue, 34, is being tried separately on an aggravated murder charge and other counts. Her trial is yet to start. Prosecutors said Allen Prue gave a detailed confession to police that implicated both him and his wife. Jenkins, a single mother, was reported missing on March 25, 2012, after her vehicle was found idling on her rural road with her two-year-old son inside. Prosecutors argued that the Prues called Jenkins and told her their car broke down, tricking her. Caledonia County State's Attorney Lisa Warren said Allen Prue confessed he and his wife wanted to 'get a girl' as someone 'they could play with,' ABC News reported. Up next: Patricia Prue's trial is set to start next month. She has pleaded not guilty, and her attorneys plan to argue the insanity defense. Prue is seen here in March 2012 . Jealous: Allen's defense attorneys claim Patricia Prue (pictured left) grew jealous of Melissa Jenkins after her husband asked the teacher out on a date. Jenkins rebuffed Allen's advances and told friends she felt uncomfortable around him . Orphaned: Jenkins was reported missing when a friend found her car abandoned on the side of a road, with her two-year-old son alone inside. The boy later told authorities: 'Someone pulled on mommy's neck' She also argued '[Jenkins] got out of her vehicle, and as she did, she was strangled and beaten to death.' The couple then took Jenkins' body back to their home where they removed all of her clothes, poured bleach on the body and wrapped her in a tarp. They dumped the body in the Connecticut River, which separates Vermont from New Hampshire, weighing the body down with blocks, and burning the clothes and tarp. Allen reported an hour late to his job delivering papers that night. The next day, her nude, strangled and beaten body was found in a remote spot. Allen Prue appears in court on the first day of his trial in Vermont Superior Court in Burlington, Vermont, on Wednesday October 8, 2014. He has now been found guilty . Police were led to the couple by a business card for Prue's plow business. Prue, who had plowed Jenkins' driveway, and his wife were arrested two days after she was killed. When news broke that he was involved in the murder, his mother said that he had never been in trouble before and doubted that he committed the crime. The killing shocked the Northeast Kingdom, an area where violent crime is rare. Both Allen and Patricia Prue may face life sentences.","Allen Prue, 32, was convicted of the first-degree murder of Melissa Jenkins, 33, on Wednesday .

"With amphetamine busts up almost 20 per cent on the previous year, drug lords are coming up with more weird and not so wonderful ways of trying to get their illegal substances into Australia. Drugs are being concealed inside everything from boxed up toilets to the everyday electrical extension cord. Almost 500 illegal drug imports are seized each week Australian by Customs and Border Protection teams. Scroll down for video . Dunny or drug box? AFP and Customs officials found this box was full of methamphetamines when they busted a drug shipment into Melbourne . This box was supposed to contain new toilets but Customs officers and AFP investigations found more than 50 kilograms of methamphetamine when they opened it up . The extension power cord is cut open to unveil hidden pseudoephedrine imported from China . Racket or racquets? An importation of tennis equipment was found to contain large quantities of the banned pseudoephedrine ContacNT from China . The highly potent pseudoephedrine called ContacNT from China has become a popular drug of choice from crime gangs. This shipment saw the substance concealed in the handles of tennis racquets . Ephedrine was packed and concealed into this helmet . Among the most surprising was a haul of 50 kilograms of methamphetamine in Melbourne earlier this year, where a combined AFP, Customs and Victoria Police operation stopped a crime gang's attempt to bring the illicit drug in as part of a large toilet shipment. And the latest drug of choice in recent times appears to be ContacNT, a powerful form of pseudoephedrine out of China. It's been found inside extension cords, the handles of tennis racquets and in batteries too. 'The risks to the Australian community posed by the movement of drugs and precursors continue to be high,' said Michael Pezzullo, chief executive of Australian Customs and Border Protection Services (ACBPS). This shipment was described as a 'textile machine' but on arrival Customs teams found 20 kilograms of meth inside. A 46 year old Taiwanese national was arrested and charged . Customs officers inspect a truck in which more than 200 kilograms of meth was concealed in the tyres . Heavy haulage vehicles are being used by criminals to conceal their drug shipments. More than 200 kilograms of methamphetamine was concealed in the large tyres . During the past year the ACBPS, which uses 42 specially trained 'detector dog teams' has made more than 25,000 drug busts, over 11,000 were major illicit drugs and precursors, with a total weight of more than four tonnes. ACBPS officials also said that drug rings have increasingly used heavy vehicle, machinery and other equipment imports, including kayaks, to hide their material. One heavy haulage truck had more than 200 kilograms of meth packed into its large tyres. More than six kilograms of ephedrine was found concealed inside these bike seats . Earlier this year $180 million worth of crystal meth, which had been hidden in more than a dozen sea kayaks, was uncovered at a Sydney warehouse. Five people were charged over the shipment from China. 'Travel and trade patterns within and to Australia are becoming more complex, with the range of goods, bio-security hazards and economic risks growing,' said Mr Pezzullo. 'The geographic area in which the service operates is also expanding, with an increased number of remote ports coming on-line and increasing operational activity. ACBPS officers this week joined forces with counterparts from across the region to strengthen maritime security in South East Asia, in an attempt to stem the flow of illicit substances. Officials from Singapore, Indonesia, Myanmar, Malaysia, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand have been undertaking vessel search training. ACBPS National Manager Border Force Capability Terry Wall said this course was an important part of the service’s engagement with its international counterparts in the region. 'Border security agencies across the region and the world face a shared and ongoing threat from organised criminal networks who are constantly seeking to breach our borders,' Mr Wall said. Criminal networks have gone as far as stuffing chocolates with heroin to try and avoid detection by Australian Customs officials .","Amphetamine busts are up 20 per cent on last year .

"It may traditionally be seen as an excruciating conversation, but 80per cent of American parents say they've had the ritualistic 'sex talk' with their teens and pre-teens. According to a new study conducted by Planned Parenthood and New York University, of those who had discussed the birds and the bees, 80per cent had done so by the time their kids were 13, and 50per cent before their kids were ten. Encouragingly, and perhaps a sign of the times, 'most' of the parents and youths questioned claimed they 'didn't feel embarrassed' talking about sex, reports TIME. No sweat: It may traditionally be seen as an excruciating conversation, but 80per cent of American parents say they've had the ritualistic 'sex talk' with their teens and pre-teens . This is 'great news,' Planned Parenthood's vice president of education, Leslie Kantor, said of the study, which assessed a 'nationally representative' sample of 1,663 parents with their children aged between nine and 21. Still, 20per cent of parents admit they've never talked to their 15 to 21-year-olds about birth control or 'strategies for saying no to sex.' And over 30per cent hadn't informed their kids on where to access reproductive health services. Interestingly, 45per cent of parents advised their kids to wait until they were married before losing their virginity - only three per cent of the population manage this, according to a 2003 government poll - while 61per cent of parents said they wanted them to wait 'until they can handle the responsibility.' Ms Kantor did point out that as a result of our digital age, kids and teenagers these days are exposed to a great deal more coverage on sex - both good and bad - than we once were. Indeed, according to Enough, a nonprofit which advocates stricter internet regulations, 79per cent of youths have been exposed to online porn in their own homes. In a recent interview, actress Jennifer Garner - who is mom to Violet, nine, Seraphina, five, and Samuel, two - said on the subject: 'The scary thing to me is what's available to them online. 'Even if they could run across it accidentally, [it] could show them something that is not connected to the way I want them to see sex. 'I want them to see sex as something joyful... a celebration of love and of their bodies.' Parental concerns: In a recent interview, actress Jennifer Garner (pictured with husband Ben Affleck and daughter Seraphina) said: 'The scary thing to me is what's available to them online' Ms Kantor suggests using mediums like TV to initiate a conversations about sex with their children, rather than avoid it. 'Even if the show is sending a terrible message, it gives you a chance to get in there with something else,' she says. And for those teens - or their parents - who still squirm at the prospect of having 'the talk,' particularly in any level of detail, Planned Parenthood has set up a 'chat and text' program. This enables young people to chat in real time with Planned Parenthood staffers about anything sex-related - a service which has initiated 393,174 conversations in the U.S. since its launch in May.","The poll was conducted by Planned Parenthood and New York University on 1,663 parents and their kids aged between nine and 21 .

Mystery: Trey Kurtz, 20, was found shot dead at a quiet intersection in Brenham, Texas late on Thursday night in a case that has stumped authorities and the student's family and friends . Alan Kurtz told Click2Houston that his son was finally himself again and ready to start school, so they picked a campus close to home. But just months later, tragedy struck. Now he is trying to find out what had happened to his youngest son, whom he called 'my best friend'. 'From what I heard, his roommate wanted to go to a party or something, and roommate decided not to [but Kurtz] decided to go to it and was walking over there,' Mr Kurtz told the channel. 'I don't know if he got in a scuffle or a fight and someone pulled a gun on him, or if it was a drive by. I don't know. 'All I know is that someone took a big piece of my life away from me that can't be replaced.' Investigators told News3 that Kurtz dies of a single gunshot wound, but would not say where on his body he had suffered the wound.

"A rare Javan Gibbon has survived the first few months of life thanks to dedicated zoo staff who continue to care for him around the clock. The male Gibbon named 'Owa', which means gibbon in Indonesian, was born on June 20 but has had to be reared by Perth Zoo keepers six days after his birth when it became clear that mother, 'Hecla' wasn't producing enough milk to sustain her infant. Primate supervisor, Holly Thompson, said the zoo has a good track record after already successfully hand-reared four white-cheeked Gibbons - but Owa is their first Javan Gibbon. 'It is difficult to rear a primate and introduce it back to its family, so it's not something we took on lightly,' she said. Scroll down for video .

Perth Zoo is responsible for the coordination of the Studbook for this unique species which involves updating the international studbook for Javan Gibbon and advising on suitable breeding and genetics for this species throughout Australasia. Javan Gibbons, also known as Silvery Gibbons are Java’s last remaining ape and are endangered due to habitat destruction and the pet trade. Surveying techniques of wild Javan Gibbons is difficult but it is suspected there are less than 2000 remaining in the wild. Over 98 per cent of their original habitat has been destroyed for the growing population of Java that was recorded at 141 million people in 2012. Perth Zoo supports the work of Silvery Gibbon Project through its Wildlife Conservation Action fundraising program. The Silvery Gibbon Project assists with releasing gibbons into West Java’s Mt Malabar and educates the local community about the importance of habitat preservation and gibbon conservation. This year Perth Zoo’s Wildlife Conservation Action program assisted the Silvery Gibbon Project to protect land in Indonesia where gibbons and Siamang live naturally.

"General Motors is sending Facebook messages to car owners who have still not fixed a potentially deadly ignition-switch defect. The automaker has resorted to using social media and making phone calls eight months after it began recalling more than two million vehicles. There has been heavy publicity surrounding the recall, including thousands of news stories and five congressional hearings, but it seems that the message is still not getting through. Scroll down for video . CEO of the automaker Mary Barra has even sent a personal letter urging people to get the switches replaced . Despite recall letters that bluntly warn that the defect can lead to injury and even death, only about 1.16 million of the 2.36 million affected vehicles still on the road have been brought in for repairs. As a result, GM has been forced to go beyond the usual ominous-sounding recall letters. It has sent out Facebook messages and made phone calls to owners of the cars, mainly Chevrolet Cobalts and Saturn Ions. CEO Mary Barra has even sent a personal letter urging people to get the switches replaced. 'In some cases we've gone to the owners' home and gotten the vehicle, gave them a loaner, and are working to fix it,' Ms Barra said last week. GM announced in February and March that it was recalling the cars after taking more than a decade to disclose the defect, now linked to at least two dozen deaths. It explained that the ignition switches can wear from heavy, dangling keys. If the key chains are bumped or people drive on rough surfaces, the switches can suddenly change from the 'run' position to 'accessory' or 'off'. Two teenage girls were killed when they were passengers in this Chevy Cobalt which went out of control on a rural road in Wisconsin and crashed . This cuts off power-assisted steering and brakes and can cause drivers to lose control. The air bags also may not inflate in a crash and protect the driver and passengers. GM is urging people not to put anything on their key rings until the switches are replaced. One of the unrepaired cars belongs to Kim Atkins, a media relations specialist in Austin, Texas, who received recall notices in April and June for her 2007 Cobalt. Busy with moving back to her hometown from college and starting a new job, she ignored them both. 'I didn't think it was very serious just from the wording on the recall notice,' said Ms Atkins, 24. 'I'm sure that it was important. I didn't get a sense of what the actual issue was, just neglected to do it.' Ms Atkins said her fiance is mad at her for dallying. Now, she has made an appointment to bring her car into the shop this week. She has also removed everything from her keychain as instructed by GM. Seven-year-old Trenton Buzard received an undisclosed compensation payout after he was paralysed when his great grand mother's Chevrolet Cobalt careered out of control when the ignition switch failed . Because the recalled cars are no longer produced, parts supplier Delphi Automotive had to bring machinery out of mothballs to start cranking out replacement switches. Repairs finally began in April when the replacement switches started to arrive at dealers. Last Wednesday, GM announced that Delphi had made enough to fix all the cars. Barra said the challenge now is to find those people who 'have still not called the dealership and said, ""Hey, let's get my car scheduled.""' GM's extraordinary efforts to reach people were part of an agreement that ended a federal investigation into why the automaker failed to promptly disclose the switch problem. It is not unusual for some car owners to ignore recall notices. The average completion rate 1.5 years after a recall begins is 75 per cent, according to federal safety regulators. But few recalls are as serious as this one. Amy Rademaker, left and Natasha Weigel, right, both died in October 2006 following a crash in Wisconsin . Kenneth Feinberg, the lawyer handling compensation claims for GM, on Monday raised the number of deaths attributed to the defect to 24. That toll is likely to rise as he handles more cases. Among the 24 is Virginia law student Lara Gass, 27, who died in March when her 2006 Saturn Ion rear-ended a tractor-trailer and caught fire on Interstate 81 while she was on her way to work as a law clerk for a federal judge. Witnesses told her family's lawyer, Bob Hilliard, that the air bags did not inflate, an indication of a defective switch. At the time of the crash, GM had announced the recall and was sending warning letters. But the parts were not yet available. Her family recently accepted a settlement from Feinberg for an undisclosed amount. Among the most recent cases settled is that of seven year old Trenton Buzard, from New Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He was paralyzed when the car being driven by his great grandmother Esther Matthews lost control due to the faulty switch and ploughed into another vehicle on April 2, 2009. Two families from Wisconsin have accepted a settlement offer from General Motors after two teenagers were killed in their cars in a crash caused by a faulty ignition switch. GM announced in February it was recalling the cars after taking more than a decade to disclose the defect, now linked to at least two dozen deaths. It explained that the ignition switches can wear from heavy, dangling keys . Amy Rademaker, 15, and Natasha Weigel, 17, were killed with the Chevy Cobalt they were passengers in crashed. A fault with the car's ignition switch turned off vital systems such as the power steering and airbags moments before the crash. About one-third of those who have not had the repairs done are people with children, while one-fifth are young people without children, GM spokesman Terry Rhadigan said. Usually those people who do not get their cars repaired are the ones who have not seen any symptoms, said John O'Dell, senior editor for the Edmunds.com automotive website. 'People just don't want to be bothered,' O'Dell said. 'They don't see this as a problem. 'It's not happening to me. 'Then they just forget about it.'","Automaker has resorted to social media eight months after first vehicle recall .

"'Pregnant man' Thomas Beatie's divorce from his ex-wife is trapped in legal limbo while an Arizona judge decides if their marriage was ever valid in the first place because Thomas, who was born a woman, has given birth to three children. The transgender made headlines four . years ago when he became pregnant because his wife Nancy couldn't have children. The couple, who married in 2003, are now trying to get divorced and work out the custody issues for their three children, plus the division of property and spousal support. However the family court judge assigned to his case, Douglas Gerlach, is questioning the . legitimacy of the marriage, because after being legally declared male, . Beatie performed that most female of miracles - child birth. Family: Thomas Beatie was granted sole custody of his three children in May after footage emerged of his estranged wife Nancy being violent towards him . Divorcing: 'Pregnant Man' Thomas Beatie, right, is hoping to divorce his wife Nancy, left, but an Arizona judge is not convinced their marriage was legal in the first place . The validity of the Beatie's marriage now hangs in the balance, as same-sex marriage is forbidden in Arizona and the state doesn't recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. Beatie was born a woman, Tracy Lehuanani Lagondino, in 1974 in Oahu, Hawaii. After undergoing male-hormone therapy he was legally allowed to change his birth certificate and driver’s license to say he is a man. He was also legally allowed to get married as a man. Judge Gerlach understands that, but as he wrote into the court record, 'In other words, it appears that, by any reasonable standard, (Beatie) was the biological mother of those children at the times they were born. As such, parties’ marriage was between a female and a person capable of giving birth, who later did so.' He asked the Arizona Attorney General’s Office for an opinion as to whether this was a valid marriage or a same-sex - and consequently invalid - marriage, but they declined the invitation to get involved. “I was surprised at the remarkable indifference I received,” Gerlach said in open court Friday. So it is up to him to make a decision that, however he rules, is likely to be taken to the Court of Appeals. Gerlach said he would reach a decision by early February. Beatie has called the judge's decision 'frustrating'. 'I live my life, I know who I am and . someone else's opinion, even though it is a Judge's opinion is not going . to change that. I am Thomas, I am husband, I am father, I am a man, hear . me roar,' he told Anderson Cooper last month. More babies: 'Hypothetically we have talked about starting a family together and we would have to check out our fertility options' Cooper pointed out that he could get the marriage annulled but Beatie, . though recognizing it would be the easiest thing to do says: 'My . marriage did happen and I was married to . Nancy for almost ten years, we paid taxes, we bought and sold homes, we . started a family together and I want that to be validated. It's being . challenged right now so if I back down from it we all lose.' His marriage to first wife Nancy reached a bitter end when footage of her appearing to violently attack her . husband, mishandle their children and destroy their computer emerged. He has previously claimed that Nancy was a violent alcoholic who would . attack him in the night and once punched him in the crotch in front of . the kids. In May, a judge gave Beatie temporary full custody over the couple’s three children. He . said: 'It's been a process. We physically separated back in March when I . filed for separation and there was a protective order but basically I . didn't wear my wedding ring for a year prior to that. Thomas Beatie shows off his pregnant stomach before becoming the first man to give birth . 'We . were supposed to finalize the divorce back a couple of months ago and . the judge is thinking it's out of jurisdiction and potentially could . rule it as same sex marriage.' Beatie has filed documents hoping to prove his marriage’s legitimacy, . highlighting that both his U.S. passport and his Hawaii birth . certificate list him as a man. When . he was in his 20s he began having testosterone injections, giving him . facial hair, a lower voice and altering his sexual organs. The . couple met shortly after Beatie began taking the testosterone. Nancy is . 11 years older than him and has two teenage daughters, Amber and Jen, . from a previous marriage. But at the . age of 28 she had a hysterectomy because of severe endometriosis - where . cells from the lining of the womb are found elsewhere in the body - so . she couldn’t have any more children. Thomas had already had a mastectomy to remove his breasts, and hormone treatment that gave him an outwardly male appearance. New start: Thomas Beatie and his new love Amber spoke to Anderson Cooper last month about their options for having a child together . But he chose to keep his female sexual organs so the couple could have children. They bought sperm from an anonymous donor and Beatie underwent artificial insemination. He . eventually fell pregnant with Susan in late 2007 and had his next two . children in quickly after, as he only had a short window of not taking . testosterone. He posed for a famous picture in 2007 which displayed him as heavily pregnant but with facial hair. He told Oprah on her show four years ago: 'I wanted to have a child one day. I didn't know how. It was just a dream.' The . couple has been open about their sex life, revealing on Oprah that the . testosterone had enlarged Beatie's clitoris. It grew to a small penis, . allowing him to have sex with his wife, he said. In . March, Beatie revealed he had filed for bankruptcy and was desperately . seeking a job to get his family off welfare handouts and pay his . $5,000-a-month mortgage. Last month Beatie appeared on Anderson Live with his new girlfriend Amber and said that they had not ruled out having babies together.","Thomas Beatie and ex-wife Nancy are seeking a divorce to finalize their split and legally put their affairs in order .

"Up to a million payday loan borrowers could be in line for refunds, it was claimed today - amid reports Wonga's founder received £4million from the controversial company when he left. Wonga was ordered this week to refund £220million in debts to 330,000 customers who took out loans they could not afford to repay. Campaigners now say the case could open to floodgates to apply to other lenders - and up to a fifth of the estimated 5million people who have taken out payday loans across the industry, not just from Wonga, in the last six years. Scroll down for video . Payout: Wonga was ordered this week to repay £220million in debts to customers who could not afford them. Campaigners now say up to a million borrowers face the same situation from lenders across the industry . Farewell: A report claimed today that Wonga's founder Errol Damelin sold a one per cent stake in his firm back to Wonga around the time he left its day-to-day running in November, valued at an estimated £4million . The 'broad brush' claim was made by Damon Gibbons of the Centre for Responsible Credit, which is campaigning for the Financial Conduct Authority to come to similar agreements with other firms. He told the Sunday Mirror the regulator could look back at cases up to six years old, which meant 'at least a fifth of those who have taken out a payday loan in the last years years would be affected' if the problems at Wonga were repeated. Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has campaigned for several years against payday lenders, told MailOnline: 'Wonga is not the bad apple - the industry is a rotten barrel. 'There have been 5million people borrowing from payday lenders and it was about a fifth of Wonga customers that were affected. 'I would be gobsmacked if the Financial Conduct Authority weren't applying the same lessons that they've already done to other lenders. Campaigning MP Stella Creasy said: 'Wonga is not the bad apple - the industry is a rotten barrel' 'There could be many more people who have been lent money without the companies knowing or caring they they could pay it back.' The claims today came amid a report that Wonga's founder, Errol Damelin, took a £4million 'farewell' when he left the day-to-day running of the firm in November last year. Sources told The Sunday Times the South African businessman, who founded Wonga in 2006 before it shot to prominence with heavy marketing campaigns, sold a one per cent stake in Wonga back to the firm. Industry analysts told the newspaper the firm would have been worth about £400million at the time, making Mr Damelin's stake worth around £4million. It is believed he was just one of a number of staff members who sold shares back to the firm. Days before this week's events it emerged Wonga's profits had nosedived by 53 per cent as it counted the cost of the 'fake letters' scandal, which was revealed in June. The firm had sent letters to thousands of its customers from non-existent law firms threatening them with legal action if they did not pay their loans back. A Wonga spokesman declined to comment on Mr Damelin's shares to MailOnline. When the £220million payout to customers was confirmed this week, Wonga's new chairman Andy Haste said: 'When I joined Wonga I was made aware of concerns the FCA had already expressed around affordable lending, concerns which I shared. 'I committed to ensuring our lending is conducted in a responsible and transparent manner, delivering the best outcomes for our customers. 'I also said this would lead to a tightening of Wonga’s lending criteria and we will now be accepting far fewer applications from new and existing customers.' Straight talking: A TV advert for Wonga. Campaigners say problems with the industry are not limited to the firm . Gillian Guy, Chief Executive of Citizens Advice, agreed with other campaigners - saying the issue went beyond Wonga. 'A lack of checks by lenders is setting a debt trap for borrowers,' she said. 'It is a widespread problem within the industry. 'Citizens Advice has found that in half of payday loans cases reported to us, lenders didn’t ask about people’s personal finances. 'Checking whether someone can actually afford to repay a loan should be at the heart of any credit process. 'The action by the FCA today should be the start of things to come to clean up the payday loan market and lenders changing their practices.'","Wonga refunding £220m debts to 330,000 people who could not pay back .

"The family of a toddler left disfigured after police threw a stun grenade into his playpen are 'devastated' that the officers involved will not face any charges. Bounkham Phonesavanh, known as 'Baby Bou Bou', lost part of his nose and left nipple, and suffered burns to his face, brain injuries and a collapsed lung when the grenade exploded while he was sleeping on May 28. But after hearing evidence for six days, this week a Georgia grand jury opted not to charge any SWAT officers who took part in the botched drug raid in which the 19-month-old was injured. Bounkham Phonesavanh, known as 'Baby Bou Bou', lost part of his nose and left nipple, and suffered burns to his face, brain injuries and a collapsed lung when the grenade exploded while he was sleeping on May 28 . The Phonesavanh's family attorney Mawuli Davis told CBS 46 Atlanta: 'We are reviewing the grand jury findings with our client. 'They are devastated and trying to comprehend the gravity of this decision. 'This is a very sad day for this family and for the people of Georgia.' The incident occurred while Bou Bou's mom Alecia Phonesavanh was staying with her husband, their three daughters and their baby son in the living room of her sister-in-law's home just outside of Atlanta. They were living with relatives after their Wisconsin home burned down earlier that year. The Habersham SWAT team executed a no-knock warrant on the property while searching for a relative they believed was a drug dealer and had a cache of weapons inside, The Atlanta-Journal Constitution reported. The search turned up neither guns nor drugs. Wanis Thonetheva, who did not live at the property, was arrested later that day and charged with possession of methamphetamine. Surgeons repaired the child's lung so he could be removed from the ventilator and patched and re-attached his nose that had been detached by the explosion, as well as treating injuries to his lips and mouth . Police threw a grenade into Bou Bou's playpen leaving him with burns, a collapsed lung and brain injuries . Bou Bou spent five weeks being treated at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta before returning home in July. Surgeons repaired the child's lung so he could be removed from the ventilator and patched and re-attached his nose that had been detached by the explosion, as well as treating injuries to his lips and mouth. Last month, the family learnt that public officials refused to foot the $800,000 medical bills for Bou Bou's treatment that they had 'publicly promised to pay'. The attorney for Habersham County stated, 'The question before the board was whether it is legally permitted to pay these expenses. Baby Bou Bou before his injuries. The child was a happy and healthy baby boy before the incident . 'After consideration of this question following advice of counsel, the board of commissioners has concluded that it would be in violation of the law for it to do so.' When asked how Bou Bou was doing ahead of this week's announcement Mr Davis told CBS Atlanta, 'He is still recovering. He had to have a surgery about a month ago which required 60 stitches to his face and 70 stitches to his chest.' He added, 'The baby will likely have to have these kinds of surgeries every two years until he reaches the age of 20 because his nerve endings in his face have been so severely damaged that they will continue to have to do these plastic reconstructive surgeries throughout most of his life.' Bou Bou's mom Alecia Phonesavanh with her husband, their three daughters and their baby son . In the wake of the incident, Mrs Phonesavanh has spoken out about what she feels is the abuse of power by police officers. She said: 'This is happening every day to people [who are] being relentlessly and unnecessarily militarized by police who think just because they're supposed to be upholding the law, they are above the law themselves. 'It’s time to remind the cops that they should be serving and protecting our neighborhoods, not waging war on the people in them.'

"A Royal Protection officer has been arrested after bullets were found hidden in personal police lockers in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. The 9mm ammunition was found in a dedicated 'police station' within the palace grounds and is believed to be from the Metropolitan Police's own supplies. The officer was arrested at his home on suspicion of misconduct in public office and unlawful possession of ammunition. He is in custody at a London police station and will be suspended from duty, the force said. Incident: A Royal Protection officer has been arrested after ammunition was found in a personal locker in the grounds of Buckingham Palace (pictured). The ammunition is believed to be from the Met Police's supplies . Royal officers receive specialist training. Pictured are officers on the roof of Buckingham Palace (file photo) The officer 'normally works in a protection role' but was not assigned to guard any individual member of the Royal family, police said. He has not been charged with an offence. He was arrested after an investigation by the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards which began a few weeks ago. The probe was triggered by other Royal Protection officers, who found ammunition in their personal lockers and belongings before raising the alarm with their bosses. Investigators are believed to be considering whether the officer could have deliberately placed the bullets in a bid to ‘discredit’ colleagues in the tight-knit unit. The palace 'police station' in which the bullets were found is just inside an entrance known as Electricians Gate, on the south side of the Royal residence. Guarded: The Palace has round-the-clock protection from specially-trained elite officers from the Met Police . The lodge houses a parade room, lockers and armoury for the squad of officers charged with protecting the Queen, her family and guests. A Met Police spokesman said: 'Investigators have been searching the officer's home address and the police building where the ammunition was found. 'Established security procedures are unaffected by the investigation, which does not affect the daily work of the officers providing personal protection to the Royal Family. Security breach: In 2004 a Fathers 4 Justice campaigner scaled the palace walls as Batman . 'These units include some of the most highly trained and professional officers in the Met. They recognise the great responsibility their roles carry, and the privilege that goes with these positions. 'The Royal Household is aware of the on-going investigation and has been briefed on today's development. The IPCC have been informed.' A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'It is a matter for the Metropolitan Police. We would never comment on security issues.' Scotland Yard refused to reveal their suspect's age or the area in which he lives for 'operational reasons', despite these two details almost always being available after any arrest. Any misuse of bullets would be an extremely serious breach of police protocol and a potential criminal offence. It is a further embarrassment for the prestigious command at a time when security is already under review at high-profile buildings in the wake of the Ottawa shooting. Last week the Met announced it was shaking up the structure of its protection wing after a litany of scandals including Plebgate. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said restructures had revealed 'a few pockets of poor behaviour which would not be tolerated'. He added: 'Nothing below the highest standards of personal behaviour is acceptable.' Senior commanders want to break up this unhealthy working culture and cut the jaw-dropping cost to taxpayers of protection operations, which include Royals, senior politicians and visiting dignitaries. A Buckingham Palace sergeant remains suspended from duty over separate claims earlier this year that he took knives, umbrellas and other items surrendered by public visitors and sold them on eBay. Officers from the elite unit have been tested by several breaches at Buckingham Palace, which was completed in 1850 and has 24-hour protection. In 2004 a Fathers 4 Justice campaigner dressed as Batman broke through heavy security to climb onto a balcony an unfurl a banner. And in 1982 the Queen infamously spent ten minutes talking to a man who had scaled a drainpipe to climb into the monarch's private apartments. Security: One member of the SO14 squad, Jim Beaton, famously took three bullets for Princess Anne during a kidnapping attempt as she returned to Buckingham Palace in her limousine in March 1974 (pictured) Ian Ball (left), 26, at the time, tried to kill the princess (right in 1974) and Captain Mark Phillips during the raid . Michael Fagan, 31, was barefoot and wearing just a T-shirt when he evaded electronic alarms and palace guards to disturb the Queen by opening a curtain. Known as SO14, the Royal Protection unit is one of the most elite in the force. Officers are picked from the Met's most experienced staff and receive specialist training. The eye-watering cost of protecting the royals is famously kept secret by authorities on security grounds, but has been estimated at around £100million by previous investigations. Several members of the Royal family as well as their homes and palaces have 24-hour protection, including some who have not been subject to any particular terror threats. One member of the SO14 squad, Jim Beaton, famously took three bullets for Princess Anne during a kidnapping attempt as she returned to Buckingham Palace in her limousine in March 1974. The altercation, which remains the closest anyone has ever come to kidnapping a member of the Royal family, took place outside the palace on the Mall. 1982: Michael Fagan broke into the Queen's bedroom after climbing the fence at Buckingham Palace and scaling a drain-pipe. He was sent to a mental hospital in Liverpool after being acquitted of stealing a bottle of wine from the Palace. June 2003: Aaron Barschak gatecrashes Prince William's 21st birthday celebrations at Windsor Castle. September 2004: A Fathers4Justice campaigner evades guards to climb on to one of the balconies at the Palace and unfurl a banner. September 2004: Weeks later two journalists claim to have 'breezed' past security with a fake bomb at Windsor Castle, weeks before the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. December 2010: A mob protesting against rising student fees stormed a car transporting the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Charles in Regent Street. Reports claimed an open window allowed one demonstrator to poke a stick at the Duchess of Cornwall. MPs called for an inquiry into the police's handling of the event after it was claimed the Royals' car should not have been driving in Regent Street at the time of the protest. September 2013: Two men were arrested on suspicion of attempting to burgle. One of the men was found in a room which had been open to the public during the day when officers found him at 10.30pm. September 2013: Days after the arrests of two men at Buckingham Palace, armed police allegedly pointed their guns at Prince Andrew after mistaking him for an intruder in the gardens.

"A vast tract of the East Coast, from Washington DC to New York is in danger of being without power for up to two years, if a massive solar flare knocks out the power grid. With the Sun pushing out unusually large solar flares, capable of disrupting power supplies, a device is being proposed that would prevent more than 300 million Americans being left without power. House Republicans have proposed legislation to push the Government to provide surge protectors and grid-saving devices that would offer protection in case of a massive electromagnetic pulse from either a flare or nuclear weapon. Electromagnetic pulses, also known as EMPs, are massive surges of energy that can come from a severe solar flare, such as this one pictured on May 12, or from a high altitude nuclear explosion . 'This is serious stuff,' the head of the Center for Security . Policy, Frank Gaffney, said. The former Pentagon official cited a Lloyds of London report that claimed a region from Washington DC to New York could be left without electricity for up to two years after a solar flare. There are also heightened fears from defense officials that terrorists could set off a small nuclear bomb overhead. About 300 . electric transformers in the U.S. which control the grid, need to be . protected, according to the Washington Examiner. A study into solar storms last year predicted there was a one in eight chance of a major one affecting Earth by 2020. The effects of a solar flare could disrupt 'transportation, communication, banking . and finance systems, and government services; the breakdown of the . distribution of potable water owing to pump failure, and the loss of . perishable foods and medications because of lack of refrigeration,' the Huffington Post said. One of the largest solar flares to be recorded this year happened on May 12. Although the Sun sent billions of tons of solar particles into space, capable of knocking out power and communication devices, they were not traveling in Earth's direction. An increase in solar flare activity has been observed in the past 12 months, as the Sun reaches the peak of its 11-year cycle. However, the proposed grid devices would offer some protection. 'You are basically talking about surge protectors, of a . somewhat exotic kind, but it is a means of interrupting the pulse,' Mr Gaffney said. Damaging: The solar flare in May was not headed in Earth's direction, but scientists predict one is likely to hit . The Secure High-voltage Infrastructure for Electricity from Lethal Damage Act has bipartisan support. 'It is critical that we protect our major transformers from cascading destruction. The Shield Act encourages industry to develop standards necessary to protect our electric infrastructure against both natural and man-made EMP events,' Trent Franks, the Arizona Republican who is offering the bipartisan bill, said. The legislation includes information from a recent electromagnetic pulse commission report that stated: 'Contemporary U.S. society is not structured, nor does it have the means, to provide for the needs of nearly 300 million Americans without electricity.'","Region from Washington DC to NYC could be without power for two years .

"A rapid shift to wind and solar power is needed if the world is to avoid catastrophic global warming, the United Nations warns in a crucial report today. Emissions of greenhouse gases need to be cut by up to 70 per cent before 2050 to control climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says. ‘Large-scale changes in energy systems’ are required, with coal power stations to be switched off and replaced by wind and solar. CCS refers to the process of capturing carbon released by burning fossil fuels and storing it in porous rock layers in areas such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs . And the transformation needs to be made in the next 15 years or . controlling climate change will become increasingly harder and more . expensive. The report was published in Berlin today after a week of line-by-line drafting and re-drafting. The . final version, written by 235 international scientists and economists, . says that efforts so far have failed to stop spiralling emissions of . greenhouse gases – which have risen to ‘unprecedented levels’ in the . past decade. Ottmar Edenhofer, co-chair of the authors, said: ‘There . is a clear message from science: to avoid dangerous interference with . the climate system, we need to move away from business as usual.’ The IPCC report is the first major assessment in seven years of the options for dealing with climate change. It . will inform the policy decisions of Governments around the world, and . vitally, will also be used as bargaining tool before next year’s UN . climate conference in Paris, which aims to set legally binding targets . on every nation to reduce carbon emissions. It is the final part in a trilogy of IPCC reports on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change. The . first part, published last September, found that scientists are 95 per . cent certain that humans are the ‘dominant cause’ of global warming. The . second part, published a fortnight ago, warned that the drastic impacts . of climate change are ‘already occurring on all continents and across . the oceans’. The final part, published today on the options for . mitigating global warming, warns that we must drastically reduce our use . of fossil fuels. The report warns: ‘Without additional efforts to . reduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond those in place today, emissions . growth is expected to persist driven by growth in global population and . economic activities.’ If no action is taken, global temperatures will . rise by up to 4.7C by the end of the century, which scientists believe . will cause irreversible and dramatic damage to the planet. Global . investment in fossil fuels will have to drop by £20billion a year until . 2030, while world investment in low-carbon alternatives will have to . rise by £90billion a year. Last year in Britain fossil fuels provided . 65 per cent of electricity, with nuclear providing 20 per cent and . renewable sources providing 15 per cent. The scientists are . optimistic that if renewable energy is quickly rolled out, homes are . built in a more sustainable and energy efficient way, and human . consumption and wastefulness is changed, climate change can be . controlled. Transforming the economy will require ‘substantial investment’ – up to 4 per cent of total global GDP between now and 2030. But . the report authors argue that money would need to be spent on energy . infrastructure anyway, and the additional spend will only slow growth by . a tiny amount, no more than 0.14 of a percentage point. Renewable energy has already started to expand , the report finds, but a rapid acceleration is now needed. ‘Regarding . electricity generation alone, renewable energy accounted for just over . half of the new electricity‐generating capacity added globally in 2012, . led by growth in wind, hydro and solar power,’ it says. But it warns that Governments will still need to pour subsidies in to get the systems off the ground. Green power: The report, by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), also highlights an urgent need for governments to switch to green energy, such as wind (pictured) and solar power . ‘Many . renewable energy technologies still need direct and/or indirect . support, if their market shares are to be significantly increased,’ it . says. Despite the focus on renewable energy, the scientists say . natural gas still has a role to play for electricity production in a . low-carbon world. The assessment is an unexpected endorsement of the . British Government’s drive to frack for shale gas, and a blow to the . green lobby which opposes it. The report says burning natural gas is a far cleaner method of energy production than burning coal. Gas . will act as a ‘bridge technology’ while renewable energy is expanded, a . phase that could last until 2050. Beyond that it would be phased out – . but may still play a role if carbon dioxide emissions could be trapped . and stored underground. The report says: ‘Greenhouse gas emissions . from energy supply can be reduced significantly by replacing current . world average coal‐fired power plants with modern, highly efficient . natural gas combined‐cycle power plants or combined heat and power . plants, provided that natural gas is available and the fugitive . emissions associated with extraction and supply are low or mitigated.’ Nuclear . power could make an ‘increasing contribution to low-carbon energy . supply’, the report finds, but the scientists warn that ‘operation . risks’ such as disposing of radioactive waste mean there are a ‘variety . of barriers and risks’. The scientists also suggest that an . experimental technology could be used to ‘suck’ carbon dioxide out of . the air, as a last-ditch ‘Plan B’ if emissions are not cut in time. The technology would work by using a little-tested system called BECCS –Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage. It would involve growing crops that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere then burn them in a power station to generate energy. The resulting emissions would then be captured at the plant and then stored underground. The net effect of that process would result in CO2 is removed from the air. Professor . Edenhofer, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said: . ‘Many different pathways lead to a future within the boundaries set by . the 2C goal [beyond which global warming becomes difficult to control. ‘All . of these require substantial investments. Avoiding further delays in . mitigation and making use of a broad variety of technologies can limit . the associated costs.’","Governments need to ditch fossil fuels, like coal and oil, says UN report .

"The Big Bang Theory star Mayim Bialik, 38, is a fan of Attachment Parenting, which sees parents sleep in the same bed as their children and carry their offspring in a sling for most of the day . She’s known to TV fans as neuroscientist Amy in cult US comedy series The Big Bang Theory – but actress Mayim Bialik has a big controversial theory that she espouses in her private life. The 38-year-old mother of two is a fan of Attachment Parenting, a philosophy that encourages ‘co-sleeping’ and ‘baby wearing’. Co-sleepers like to share the same bed as their children, while baby wearers carry their offspring in a sling close to their body for most of the day. Mayim, who has sons aged nine and six, reveals in a new book that she breast-fed them until they were four and two respectively. She says parenting should be instinctive. ‘Hundreds of thousands of years of evolution have prepared all of us, should we so choose, to be a good parent. The knowledge we need is programmed into our DNA.’ Mayim, who qualified as a neuroscientist in 2008, sets out her guide to parenting in new book Beyond The Sling: A Real Life Guide To Raising Confident, Loving Children The Attachment Parenting Way. Scroll down for video . The 38-year-old mother of two is a fan of Attachment Parenting, a philosophy that encourages ‘co-sleeping’ and ‘baby wearing' Don’t cancel your gym membership just yet if you want a good night’s sleep: That’s the message behind a new study which has found a link between fitness levels and sleeping problems. The research involved more than 8,000 men and women who were tested for their cardio-respiratory fitness when walking or running on a treadmill in four clinic visits every two years. Those participants who had let their fitness slide and were no longer able to exercise for as long on the treadmill were more likely to have trouble sleeping. The data from the study, carried out at the University of Georgia, showed that the number of complaints about sleep quality rose by about eight per cent for each minute’s decrease in treadmill endurance. A new colonoscope that offers surgeons a much better view inside the large intestine could improve detection rates for colorectal cancers. Most colonoscopes used in standard cancer screening tests are in the form of a forward-only viewing device that has a 170-degree field of view. These have proved to be successful but the relatively limited viewing angle means some cancerous growths could be missed. The new device, called a Full Spectrum Endoscopy system, uses three cameras on the front and side of a flexible arm which gives a 330-degree view of the colon walls. In one study in Israel, where the technology was developed, it was shown to have a ‘miss rate’ of just eight per cent for adenomas – the polyps which can turn into cancer – compared with a 42 per cent miss rate for the traditional design.

"When dusk descends each evening on this sleepy suburban hamlet, it's mob rule on the streets - mobs of kangaroos each lorded over by an 'Alpha male'. Just over 100km north of Sydney's central business district, the quiet township has a population of 500 people and 200 kangaroos, with the marsupials growing faster than the humans and taking right of way. But the residents of of tiny Wyee Point, in Lake Macquarie, NSW, about an hour and a half north of Sydney, did not think anything of their kangaroo mobs or regular evening encounters with the marsupials until a video of two 1.4m tall male kangaroos in a 'boxing fight' in one of their streets went viral this week. Scroll down for video . Wyee Point, 100km north of Sydney, has a population of 500 people and 200 kangaroos, with the marsupials growing faster than the humans and taking right of way . Like the other residents of Wyee Point, Rod Langham (centre back, pictured with his wife Marlene and their five children Corey, 28, Kiera, 25, Christina, 23, Thomas, 12 and Renee, 10) did not think anything of the kangaroo mobs or regular evening encounters with the marsupials . Shot on his phone by local father of five, Rod Langham, the five minute video of a rogue buck and the resident Alpha male of Watanga Crescent, Wyee Point punching and kicking each other while balancing on their tails has attracted 1.5 million views on YouTube. And now that images of Mr Langham's neighbourhood have gone around the world, the 54-year-old sheet metal worker is becoming a media personality. Mr Langham, who a week ago didn't really know what YouTube was, is being interviewed by foreign TV crews fascinated with the footage of the two buck roos slugging it out in a classic mating season joust for domination right outside his front door. The international media attention has astonished Mr Langham, who with his wife, Marlene, a trainee psychiatric nurse, moved to the street just over ten years ago to provide a better life for themselves and their children, aged 10 to 28 years old. The father-of-five filmed the viral footage of two kangaroos fighting in the street outside his house (above) on Watanga Crescent at Wyee Point . He said the fight was between an Alpha male who lives with his family on the street and a 'rogue male' who challenged the buck in a 20 minute stoush . Residents say they ofetn see groups of roos in the street - and are forced to drive around them . In that time they have seen Wyee Point - an old 19th century sawmill settlement which lies on picturesque Lake Macquarie, on the NSW Central Coast - experience a boom in its kangaroo population. 'There's a mob each with an alpha male for every street,' Mr Langham told Daily Mail Australia, 'and there's three in the making at any one time, one joey in the pouch and two others. 'They put the housing estate in here 15 years ago between Morisset and Wyee Point, where there was a lot of bushland. Booming population: Kangaroos, also known as boomers, have been growing in unprecedented numbers in the township of Wyee Point, on the NSW Central Coast, where Watanga Crescent resident and father of five Rod Langham filmed the YouTube viral media hit video of two boxing male roos . Kung fu: During the fight, the two bucks can be seen pawing at each other's head, shoulders and chests, just like boxers during a 20 minute encounter which metal worker Rod Langham said he couldn't capture all of on his phone because it ran out of memory . Kangaroos, also known as macropods, which mean large foot, are Australian marsupials which grow to a height of 1.5m in the male of the species. They move by hopping at a speed of up to 40kph, using their powerful tail and hind legs to propel themselves. Male kangaroos are called bucks, boomers or jacks and the females are does, or jills, and the young are called joeys. A group is a mob, troop or court. Kangaroos are herbivores and usually docile towards humans, but fighting is common among males, particularly during Spring when the females are in season. During a fight, kangaroos adopt a high standing posture and paw at each other’s head, shoulders, and chests, just like boxers. They will also lock forearms, wrestle and kick and push each other. 'It's only a matter of time that their population will overtake the likes of us, but you have to show them respect. They were here long before we were.' Mr Langham was at home in his garage on Monday, September 29 when just after 4pm his 23-year-old daughter, Christina, alerted him to the sounds of punching and thumping coming from the street. 'She came in and said, ""Dad, look at this"" and I came outside to see these two males having a go at each other. 'We're so used to kangaroos around in the streets, but the fighting only happens once a year, in Spring, so I thought I'm going to get a video of this.' Mr Langham filmed the kangaroos sparring with each other for five minutes and 19 seconds until his phone ran out of memory. Then the punching and kickboxing continue for another fifteen minutes until the two kangaroos broke and the rogue male hopped away. 'I don't think they really meant to hurt each other because there was no rips into their tummy with their claws,' Mr Langham said, 'I think it was just a show for the girls - there were female kangaroos watching it. Tail action: The roos are seen to balance on their powerful tails and raise their legs to kick at one another, but Rod Langham believes the joust was a 'show for the ladies' as they didn't rip each other's bellies with their claws and a group of female kangaroos was watching the entire incident . Outnumbered: Rod Langham says since he and his wife Marlene moved their family into Watanga Crescent, Wyee Point ten years ago the kangaroo population has burgeoned and will eventually outnumber them, but he respects the roos and is careful to give them right of way each evening on the roads . 'We're used to kangaroos coming in each morning and evening to graze on our manicured lawns. 'When you see a mob on the road and you are driving, you give way or drive around them. 'But you don't usually see them fighting. That usually happens in the bush, so this was something different.' Face off: Typically of male kangaroos during Spring when the females are in season, the two adult males fight over access to females or the ascendant position near a water source, but Rod Langham said the confrontation usually happens in the bush rather than on a suburban street . At it again: Just after 4pm on Monday, September 29  just after Rod Langham's 23-year-old daughter, Christina, alerted him to the sounds of punching and thumping coming from the street. He walked out of his garage to find the two male buck kangaroos (above) fighting and filmed them on his phone . Mr Langham showed his wife and their other children, Corey, 28, Kiera, 25, and Thomas, 12, and ten-year-old Renee the footage, but it was only when he went to work and showed it to his colleagues that someone recommended he upload it to YouTube. With his children's help, he uploaded it on October 2. 'It didn't really start taking off until Sunday. It had a couple of hundred hits and then suddenly it was 30,000 and then it just took off. 'I've done interviews and I keep on getting phone calls. Now there's a crew from Brazil who are interviewing me via Skype.'","The boxing kangaroo video that went viral this week was shot in Wyee Point, NSW .

"An anti-abortion campaigner has been attacked for running a controversial message on Facebook during the AFL Grand Final on Saturday. The message came from Fred Nile, the head of the Official Christian Democratic Party. It features a picture of the Melbourne Cricket Grounds stadium people with the following message: . ’90,000 babies were aborted since the last AFL Grand Final. They will never see a footy match. Christian Democratic Party-vote pro-life and help save lives.’ Nile is the longest serving politician in NSW, with a career in parliament spanning over 33 years. He is strongly homophobic and anti-abortion in his policies. This anti-abortion image hijacked the AFL Grand Final yesterday, appearing on the Facebook news feeds of people following the game . Fred Nile (above) is the longest serving politician in NSW, with a career in parliament spanning over 33 years. He is strongly homophobic and anti-abortion in his policies . Last year, Niles introduced first bill of Zoe's Law, which is named an incident where a pregnant woman lost her unborn child after being hit by an intoxicated car driver. The bill seeks to achieve legislative recognition of foetuses as living persons, separate from their mothers. It has a blanket sentencing of 10 years. He is still campaigning to have the law introduced. He told Daily Mail the bill is still on the cards. Jacinda Woodhead, a pro-abortion activist, says Nile 'represents an extreme fringe minority opinion in Australia' 'Zoe's Law successfully passed the Lower House of Parliament, and it is being discussed among members of the Upper House.' Mr Nile said the AFL post was 'Intended to raise awareness as to the scale of abortions. 90,000 a year is a huge loss of life.' Pro-abortion activists have condemned the message. Jacinda Woodhead, a pro-choice campaigner who is currently completing a PhD project about abortion in Australia, told Daily Mail ‘Fred Nile represents an extreme fringe minority opinion in Australia. 'Frankly, his outlandish provocations are not unexpected from a man who is perpetually trying to turn Australia – a secular country – into a Christian nation, one with particularly puritanical views on women and their bodies.’ ‘As his presentation at the recent World Congress of Families illustrates, Fred Nile thinks the Devil controls gay people, single mothers, women more generally, and welfare – the thing a society provides so the most vulnerable are protected, and can continue to live and thrive,’ she said. ‘The anti-choice movement supports Fred Nile’s Christian theocratic identity because of his opposition to abortion and gay rights, but the rest of Australia moved on from these debates long ago.'","Fred Nile posted an anti-abortion ad on Facebook during the AFL Grand Final .

The 45-year-old said the incident happened in front of a friend and that it has left him 'humiliated and upset'. Mr Pinner of Bedford said: 'They said they couldn't let me in because I was walking funny. 'I explained to them at the time I had cerebral palsy but they didn't seem to take any notice. 'Everything I have built up over the years, like my confidence and self-belief, they have destroyed.'

"Mrs Justice Parker, of the Court of Protection, warned social workers that they should not automatically believe allegations of domestic violence . A High Court judge yesterday warned social workers that they should not automatically believe allegations of domestic violence. Parents in a broken marriage can 'rewrite history in their own minds' when they make accusations against each other, Mrs Justice Parker said. The judge condemned a mother of three boys who had accused their father of violence. In reality, Mrs Justice Parker said, the woman had herself been violent towards the boys. She had manipulated her 15-year-old son, turned him against his father, and encouraged him to act as ‘a knight in shining armour’ on her behalf. The ruling overturned the advice of social workers that the children should spend Christmas with their mother. Instead, the judge ordered that the 15-year-old should go to his grandmother while the younger boys stay with their father. Mrs Justice Parker said that social workers had uncritically accepted allegations of violence the mother made against the father. They had also ignored his evidence which showed she was very emotionally troubled. The mother had shown physical violence to the children and had inappropriately allowed her eldest son to become her confidante and to discipline his brothers. He had even sent ‘disturbing’ texts urging them to resist contact with their father. The judge said: ‘Parents who obstruct the relationship with either mother or father are inflicting untold damage on their children and it’s about time the professionals truly understood this.’ She said social workers had not taken into account the degree of parental manipulation in the case and the danger represented to the younger children from the power given to their 15-year-old brother. ‘I am in no doubt that he feels he needs to fight his mother’s corner on contact,’ the judge said. ‘I don’t think that he is developing as he should under her influence and in her home. ‘I cannot trust him to co-operate and I think it’s doing him harm. ‘At his age, he should be regarding both of his parents as out of touch and useless – rather than siding with one against the other,’ she said. ‘The extent to which he has become a knight in shining armour for his mother is truly concerning.’ Mrs Justice Parker issued the warning during a case at the Royal Courts of Justice in London . The couple, who married in the mid-1990s, were both intelligent and articulate but their inconsistent parenting had led to the eldest boy showing some extraordinarily violent behaviour. He was the ‘carrier for the toxic emotions in this family’, the judge said. ‘It is my view that the ascertainable wishes and feelings of these boys have been demonstrated. They are more than happy to be with their father and may feel some relief being out of the maelstrom.’ She added: ‘I regard parental manipulation of children, of which I distressingly see an enormous amount, as exceptionally harmful.’ Mrs Justice Parker said she was in no doubt that the mother’s record was such that she should not currently have contact with the two younger boys. ‘Much as I would like to give these boys Christmas as they believe they want it, it is unsafe for them to spend Christmas Day with their mother and her family,’ she said. The judge ruled that they should live with their father until the case returned to court, while the older boy should live with his grandmother and only see his mother under supervision. Mrs Justice Parker said she was not suggesting the father was an angel, but that he was genuinely concerned for the boys, had a more objective view of what was in their best interests, and far more empathy than the mother. She added: ‘I take domestic violence extremely seriously. It is a terrible social evil when it exists. But not all allegations of domestic violence and abuse are true and at the end of a stormy and difficult marriage as this has been between the parents of the children, it is very easy for parents to re-write history in their own minds.’","Mrs Justice Parker issued warning to social workers dealing with couples .

"Abuser: Walter Javier Martinez, 45, admitted to supervisors that he had inappropriately touched patients in his care while bathing them but denies charges of sodomy and rape . A hospice worker accused of fondling and sodomizing elderly patients had rape, sodomy and sexual assault charges against him dropped because the victims had died or succumbed to Alzheimer's and couldn't testify. Walter Javier Martinez, 45, had been facing felony charges in connection with numerous episodes of sexual abuse while working at three St Louis-area nursing homes as an employee of Odyssey Hospice. The charges were replaced with four misdemeanor counts of elder abuse, to which Martinez pleaded guilty. A one-year sentence was suspended by the judge, who put Martinez on two years' probation. The St Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the assaults first came to light after Martinez admitted to a therapist that he had inappropriately touched patients while bathing them. His supervisor called state authorities after Martinez confessed to fondling women under his care, one a 99-year-old woman at Sunrise Assisted Living in Chesterfield. At the other elder care facility, Bethesda Meadow in Ellisville, Martinez's 80-year-old victim was not coherent enough to give a statement. Martinez submitted a written letter of resignation to his supervisors, telling them he 'also self-reported to the Department of Mental Health and Senior Services.' 'I reported the sexual abuse I did with two patients,' the letter reads. He was awaiting trial on those charges of assault when another woman at Big Bend Woods Healthcare Center in Valley Park came forward alleging he raped and sodomized her. Ed Magee, assistant to county prosecutor Robert McCulloch said charges were eventually reduced because the victims in Chesterfield and Valley Park had passed away, and late-stage Alzheimer's had left the Ellisville woman unable to testify and confirm Martinez's confession. Martinez's lawyer Matthew Radefield maintains that he was innocent of charges of rape and sodomy, claiming that the victim had a history of verbal and physical abuse against male aides. Radefeld also claimed that during a deposition, the woman pointed out the defense attorney as the attacker rather than Martinez. Home: Sunrise Assisted Living in Chesterfield was the site of a 99-year-old's sexual assault, after a hospice worker groped her while giving her a bath . Scene: The 80-year-old victim from Besthesda Meadow could not coherently give testimony to police after they were called to the facility . Richie Plass, the son-in-law of the surviving victim told the Post-Dispatch he understood the decision to reduce the charges, though it doesn't make it less difficult to accept. 'He knew these women had dementia,' Plass said. 'He knew they couldn’t speak, and he still made the decision to do these acts.' As part of Martinez's guilty plea, he must surrender his healthcare license and stay away from jobs where he would be working with the elderly. His misdemeanors would not require him to register as a sex offender.","Walter Javier Martinez, 45, had been facing felony charges of rape, sodomy and sexual assault but his victims had died or could not coherently provide testimony because of dementia .

"A federal appeals court on Thursday gave Texas permission to fully enforce a sweeping abortion law signed by Republican Gov. Rick Perry last year that would effectively close all but seven abortion facilities in America's second-most populous state. Two years ago, Texas had more than 40 abortion facilities. Many clinics have already closed under a part of the law requiring doctors who perform abortions to obtain hospital admitting privileges, and now more than a dozen remaining clinics are set to shutter as well. The decision by a panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court in New Orleans wipes out what was a fleeting victory for abortion rights groups - a lower court in August blocking requirements of the law that say clinics must meet hospital-level operating standards to stay in business. A federal appeals court on Thursday gave Texas permission to fully enforce a sweeping abortion law signed by Republican Gov. Rick Perry last year that would effectively close all but seven abortion facilities in America's second-most populous state . The ruling is only a stay pending a full appeal, but the court wrote that Texas is likely to prevail. If it does, the clinics would have to make costly upgrades to meet the new standards and reopen. The impact stands to be felt most along the Texas-Mexico border and in the western half of the state, where access to a legal abortion is especially limited. The only abortion clinic in McAllen, which reopened after the lower court's ruling, now stands to close again. That would leave women in the Rio Grande Valley facing a 300-mile drive to the next-nearest abortion facility. But the court wrote that 'women from McAllen have been travelling outside their city for nearly a year and Plaintiffs made no showing that clinics in San Antonio (or any other city) have been deluged.' U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel of Austin ruled in August that the Texas law would require abortion clinics to spend millions of dollars on hospital-level upgrades and that it was less about safety than making access to abortion difficult. The Hilltop Women's Reproductive clinic in El Paso, Texas, could be set to close along with twelve other facilities in the state . Abortion-rights groups bristled on Thursday over having that victory taken away. 'Today's ruling has gutted Texas women's constitutional rights and access to critical reproductive health care and stands to make safe, legal abortion essentially disappear overnight,' said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights. Under the entire scope of the law, only seven abortion facilities in Texas meet the requirements. All those facilities are concentrated around the major cities of Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth. Attorneys for the state have denied that women would be burdened by fewer abortion facilities, saying nearly 9 in 10 Texas women would still live within 150 miles of a provider. The law's opponents, however, note that still leaves nearly a million Texas women embarking on drives longer than three hours to get an abortion . Democrat Wendy Davis temporarily blocked the law in the state Senate last summer when she carried out a 13-hour filibuster . Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is the favorite to be elected Texas' next governor in November, is defending the law in court. 'This decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas Legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women,' Abbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean said. Democrat Wendy Davis, who's running against Abbott, launched her campaign for governor behind the celebrity she achieved through a nearly 13-hour filibuster last summer that temporarily blocked the law in the state Senate. The lawsuit in Texas is the latest battle over tough new abortion restrictions sweeping across the U.S. Earlier Thursday, an Oklahoma doctor who performs nearly half the state's abortions filed a lawsuit to block that state's admitting-privileges law.","A federal appeals court has given Texas permission to fully enforce a sweeping abortion law signed by Gov.

"An 18-year-old woman who arrived in Queensland from west Africa has again tested negative for Ebola and has returned home. 'The patient has undergone a second round of testing and results show that she does not have Ebola Virus Disease,' a statement from Queensland Health said on Wednesday. The woman has been discharged from the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital. A Queensland Health spokeswoman told AAP the 18-year-old woman confirmed the young woman will complete the 21-day incubation period for Ebola at home. Scroll down for video . The woman has been discharged from the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital after testing negative to two different Ebola tests . Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young, pictured here in 2009, confirmed the young woman will complete the 21-day incubation period for Ebola at home and is expected to return to normal life mid-week . She's expected to return to normal life mid-next week. She was taken to hospital on Saturday night after coming down with a fever. On Monday she tested negative for Ebola, but remained in isolation until her second test also confirmed that she was clear of the virus. The woman moved to Australia from Guinea about 15 days ago with eight members of her extended family and immediately went into home isolation. She  was one of 19 people from four African families who agreed to go into home isolation earlier this month, after travelling to Queensland from parts of west Africa ravaged by the deadly virus. The 18-year-old woman recently arrived in Australia from West Africa, and Saturday night had a high fever . Staff were checking the family's health daily and on Saturday night the 18-year-old developed a fever . Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said Queensland had been aware of the family's arrival, and the woman, two other adults, and six children had not come into contact with anyone since being in Australia. The 18-year-old is the third person in Queensland to have been tested for Ebola. Earlier on Wednesday, Queensland Premier Campbell Newman said all people arriving in Australia from Ebola-affected countries should be tested for the disease regardless of their symptoms. Thousands of people have already died from the virus in West African nations such as Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia . Mr Newman wrote to Immigration Minister Scott Morrison requesting new measures be taken to protect the country from Ebola. The premier called for quarantine workers to test all passengers coming from Ebola-affected areas for the disease within 24 hours of their arrival. He said travellers coming from Ebola zones should have to give their contact details and their temperature recordings to quarantine officers. Mr Newman said within 24 hours of their arrival they should undergo comprehensive Ebola assessments. Australia is yet to confirm a single Ebola case, but the Queensland government has been talking about the looming threat and its actions to protect against it nearly daily. This is the second scare this month after Cairns nurse Sue Ellen Kovack returned from Sierre Leone exhibiting symptoms. She had been working as a volunteer treating patients but was later cleared of having the potentially deadly virus.

The street was built in 1699 and has been home to English diarist and playwright Fanny Burney in 1818 as well as British Whig statesman George Grenville. In the time of Queen Anne and George I, the celebrated Earl of Peterborough also lived in the prestigious street. He confessed to having committed three capital crimes before he was 20-years-old, according to historian Mr John Timbs. The Honourable Mrs Norton also on Bolton Street  in 1841, before settling in Chesterfield Street, Hatton, in 1708. The street was built in 1699 and has been home to English novelist Fanny Burney and British Whig statesman George Grenville . It is currently being let out for a staggering £26,000 per month and has a private lift and terrace  in central London . She described Bolton Street as being 'the most westerly street in London, between the road to Knightsbridge south and the fields north.' Charles Edward Stuart, The Young Pretender, is also said to have lodged here secretly when in London in the mid 18th century. The sale is unusual as buyers don't tend to shop for super-expensive homes at auction because of the potential waste of money involved in researching the property, according one industry expert. Henry Pryor, a buying agent, said: 'Few people would choose to auction an expensive home since doing so may well restrict the number of potential buyers. 'When the gavel goes down it signifies a binding exchange of contracts which means that anyone bidding must have done all their preparatory work before the day. 'If they then lose out then the cost of all that work, of lawyers, surveyors, mortgage brokers etc., is all wasted.' The mansion will be sold alongside more than 15 homes at Countrywide Auctions' on October 22 at Le Meridien Hotel in Piccadilly . The mansion, which is marketed by Hamptons International, is up for sale at Countrywide Auctions on October 22 at Le Meridien Hotel in Piccadilly, London. It will be sold alongside more than 15 homes which have a guide price of less than £70,000, including a one-bed flat in Stockton on Tees which could fetch just £25,000. If all of the remaining 61 properties fetch their guide price, they will sell for around £9.7 million - just £1.4 million more than the single Mayfair home. At £8.3 million, the buyer of the Mayfair home would also have £581,000 in stamp duty, which is more than the guide prices of any of the other homes at the auction. Despite this, the agent behind the sale has described the seven-figure home as being offered at a 'reasonable price' and a potentially good investment. Dominic Hallett, assistant manager of Hamptons International, Mayfair, said: 'It presents a wonderful opportunity to a successful buyer to purchase prime Mayfair real estate at a reasonable price. 'What's more, this pocket of Mayfair, primarily Bolton Street and Clarges Street, is currently undergoing huge residential development which will only serve to close the gap and in some cases supersede values in other more established parts of Mayfair.' Mark Tanton, head of London auctions at Countrywide added: 'It is uncommon to see a prime Mayfair single residential building a stone's throw from the Ritz come to auction. 'But it is a fantastic way for the vendor to sell quickly and get a strong price.'","Seven-bedroom mansion in the heart of Mayfair, central London, is up for auction with a guide price of £8.3million .

"The teaching assistant sent home on her first day for having too many tattoos is facing fresh controversy after it emerged that she had posted nude pictures of herself online. Charlotte Tumilty, 26, was turned away from her trainee role at a Catholic school in Hartlepool when staff took exception to her body art. The mother-of-two has inkings on her feet, hands and neck and was told they were 'inappropriate'. Nude photographs have emerged of Charlotte Tumilty, pictured, who claimed she was sent away from her first day working in a Catholic school because of her tattoos . Despite passing an earlier interview, within a hour of starting the position she was told to go home and come back with plasters and bandages covering them up. And her future has now been thrown into fresh doubt after erotic photos, some completely nude, appeared on a number of websites. Miss Tumilty admitted posing for some 'old' pictures when she was aged 18, but has refused to comment further. Appearing under the name of Charlie Horizon the photos show her in compromising and revealing positions. In some of the images she can be seen pulling down her trousers to expose her behind, while in many she is completely topless. On one of the sites, Miss Tumilty says she is 23 and, using poor spelling and punctuation, writes: 'I'm my own person in my own world I lead my own unique style and I dont follow anyone elses fashion trend. 'I have numerous tattoos I am a walking sketch book full of art. Miss Tumilty has admitted posing for some 'old' pictures when she was aged just 18, but has refused to comment further . 'I create and design my own clothes. 'I wanna show that a modifide (sic) body can be beautiful.' Miss Tumilty is currently on a level two teacher training course at Hartlepool College of Further Education. She was due to undertake the teaching assistant placement at St John Vianneys Primary School in the city twice a week for a year. She said earlier this week: 'They showed me to the class I was working in. 'But a woman asked to speak to me in the office and said 'what we need to discuss is you can still see a bit of your neck tattoo peaking out of your top?' 'I suggested wearing a higher-necked top. The woman said 'that's not the point, it's a strictly Catholic school and tattoos are forbidden'. Miss Tumilty is currently on a level two teacher training course at Hartlepool College of Further Education . 'She said they do have teachers with tattoos, but they cover them up. 'I said 'yes, I have covered mine up', but the woman said 'to be honest, I don't think it's appropriate'. 'She then suggested I might be able to use plasters and bandages to cover them up. I'd look ridiculous.' Miss Tumilty has full 'sleeves' of tattoos on her arms and legs, small ones on her fingers, hands, back and chest and an eye emblem on her neck. She said when she went for an interview at the school to secure her placement staff could see her tattoos - but she did promise to take her piercings out. School bosses insisted that Miss Tumilty was not told she could not work in the school, but was asked to consider covering up her tattoos and return to her placement later this week. The deputy headteacher at St John Vianney's Primary (pictured) insists Miss Tumilty was just politely asked to cover her tattoos . Deputy headteacher Martin Boagey said: 'The school expects all members of staff to project a professional image and we have a code of conduct, part of which requires members of staff with tattoos to cover them up. Miss Tumilty had said she had been invited back to the school, but did not hold out much hope of it working as some of her tattoos were still visible. The school refused to comment on the photographs and said they stood by their original statement and did not wish to be drawn into anything further on Miss Tumilty's actions. Hartlepool College of Further Education and the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle, which oversees the school, have been contacted for a comment.","Images of teaching assistant Charlotte Tumilty appear on several websites .

"The BBC has apologised  after the sister of murdered schoolgirl Alice Gross branded its flagship Question Time programme 'exceptionally insensitive'. Nina Gross, 19, angrily accused the broadcaster of allowing 'political agendas' to exploit a family tragedy. She provoked a huge swell of support after denouncing what she called a 'horrible' discussion on the current affairs show. Scroll down for video . Nina Gross, 19, (left) branded the BBC 'extremely insensitive' after a Question Time debate about her sister Alice (right). She has accused Corporation bosses of allowing 'political agendas' to exploit the tragedy . Amid a flurry of messages, she said: 'This is a personal tragedy which we want to deal with privately, rather than fearing anyone using it for any political agenda.' The storm forced the BBC to apologise, first in a message to the teenager and later in a contrite public statement. A spokesman said the matter was only discussed after careful consideration but offered the broadcaster's profound apologies. Scotland Yard detectives continue to work around the clock to trace Latvian builder Arnis Zalkalns, the 41-year-old prime suspect for the murder of Alice. David Dimbleby (third from right), presenting the debate show from Northampton, along with (from left to right) Julian Huppert MP, Susie Boniface, Grant Shapps MP, Stella Creasy MP and Charlie Mullins . The discovery of the 14-year-old's body wrapped in plastic and buried under logs in a West London river earlier this week confirmed her family's worst fears. The case has sparked controversy across Europe after it emerged that Zalkalns is a convicted murderer who has roamed freely across European Union borders. On Thursday evening, a member of the audience asked the Question Time panel if convicted criminals should be allowed unrestricted movement. Alice went missing from her home on August 28 and police launched a murder investigation this week after her body was discovered in the River Brent. Officers said 'significant efforts' had been made to conceal it . Referring to Zalkalns, host David Dimbleby said: 'This is, of course, referring to the hideous murder of Alice Gross and the person who is being sought, who is a convicted murderer from Latvia.' Liberal Democrat MP Julian Huppert said: 'There was a catastrophic failure in this case, he should never have been allowed to come in. There is a computer system that's supposed to sort this out and for some reason it didn't happen.' He said the UK should work more closely with other countries and encourage information sharing to better understand who might be entering Britain. He then added: 'We have to know who are the people that really shouldn't be coming in – let's keep them out.' Nina Gross took to Twitter last night to condemn the BBC for using her sister's death for 'political agendas' Panellist Grant Shapps, the Tory Party chairman, said: 'The case about that specific individual is horrendous. The news coverage is appalling and of course we should be able to control our own borders. 'We do, fortunately, have some control over our borders and I think there is a very strong case to be looked at here in terms of the seriousness of the crime. It's also another reason why we want to renegotiate with the EU over things like border control.' Within minutes of the comments, Nina sent a series of messages on Twitter attacking the broadcaster. She said: 'Now is not the time for these discussions; it is exceptionally insensitive to talk about these issues at this time.' Family: Alice's sister Nina (left), pictured with Alice and their mother (right), described the programme as 'extremely insensitive' She added: 'In future, please respect our wishes as we grieve. This is a personal tragedy which we want to deal with privately, rather than fearing anyone using it for any political agenda.' Hundreds of social media users also condemned the BBC's coverage and called for complaints to be made to Ofcom. Luke Adar wrote: 'Filled out a full complaint to the BBC, very disappointed that they found it appropriate to use this as a debate topic.' Alice's family had earlier appealed for privacy in which to grieve following the discovery of Alice's body. Her parents Jose Gross, 60, and Rosalind Hodgkiss, 50, said: 'This is a time for grieving and not a time for anger or recriminations.' Further tests are being carried out on Alice's body to find out how she died after a six-hour post mortem examination proved inconclusive. Forensic experts are also examining her clothes and materials used to conceal her body in the Brent River in the hope of recovering evidence. She vanished while walking home on September 28. In its apology, the BBC said: 'We applied careful and due consideration to our choice of question and attempted to deal with this matter as sensitively as possible.' Grief: Jose Gross, 60, and Rosalind Hodgkiss, 50, (pictured together last week, right) said they were 'completely devastated' by the news that the body of their daughter Alice (left) had been found in the River Brent .

"Leon Lane (pictured) headbutted a man, pushed a woman over and racially abused a doorman after being taunted about being ginger . A clubber headbutted a man, pushed a woman to the floor and racially abused a doorman – after being taunted about being ginger. Leon Lane, from, Aberaeron in Wales, said he was ‘targeted’ by a group of revellers in a nightclub because of his hair colour – and then struggled to control his aggression. Witnesses saw the drunk 20-year-old assault a man and push a woman over before a doorman at Aberystwyth’s Pier Pressure nightclub intervened to try and calm him down. A court heard how he then hurled racial abuse at another doorman before police were called out to the incident, in the early hours of August 10. Lane admitted in court to using threatening behaviour – but insisted he was not racially prejudiced, claiming he had become angry after being taunted about his red hair earlier that night. He said he did not think it was fair that he could be abused and that people ‘don’t like it when something is said back to them’. Prosecutor Vaughan Pritchard Jones said police attended the scene amid reports Lane was acting aggressively. But the doorman involved had not wanted to make a complaint about the racial abuse, he added. Mr Pritchard Jones said: ‘This young man was under the influence of alcohol and trying to pick a fight with anyone who would fight him.’ Aberystwyth Magistrates' Court heard that the offence had also breached a conditional discharge imposed in a London court after Lane was convicted of being drunk and disorderly and assaulting a police officer. Lane, who represented himself, said he was angry that he had been ‘targeted’ by a group because of his hair colour. He said: ‘It angers me that people think that it’s okay to say something like that to me, but don’t like it when something is said back to them.’ Witnesses saw Leon Lane assault a man and push a woman over before a doorman at Aberystwyth’s Pier Pressure nightclub (to the left of the picture) intervened to try and calm him down . Lane told magistrates that his behaviour had been unacceptable and that he hoped to be able to get help to control his anger. He was sentenced to a six-month community order with a supervision requirement. He was also fined £40 and will pay costs totalling £145. The previous conditional discharge was revoked.","Leon Lane said he was 'targeted' by other revellers because of hair colour .

"Men who have children by different women should be paid a special allowance by the state for increasing the population, a Russian MP claimed. A new 'Macho Law' was proposed by Valery Seleznev, who believes that marriage for life is outdated. Mr Seleznev said: 'Let's stimulate productive men so they can receive paternity capital and use it, for example, for alimony payments.' Russian Liberal Democratic Party MP Valery Seleznev, left, wants to create a state allowance for men who have children with different women . He wants to extend a system which allows Russian women to claim special 'maternity capital allowances' of around £6,500 when they have more than one child. The money - he did not specify the sum - could be used to help buy a flat or for education. He said: 'Some men have several children from different women, each of whom is not eligible for the 'maternity capital programme, as some of them have only one child, and others can be married to another man. 'Often such men do not have enough money to pay for their children. 'And we should not be shutting our eyes to the fact that the marriage has long stopped being 'once and forever', while Russia needs to increase the population.' The MP for the pro-Kremlin Liberal Democratic Party is drawing up the new the new legislation which he said might be called a Male Law, or Macho Law. Mr Seleznev, 50, seen second from left at a business forum, has been married 'multiple times' Vice premier Olga Golodets said she was astonished by the proposal but said: 'Any unusual idea has the right to be considered.' Father of three Mr Seleznev, 50, from Vladivostok, is described as having been married 'multiple' times. and his motto is: 'We need a strong, great Russia.' His own son Roman, 29, from his first marriage, was arrested in the Maldives in July, before being moved in controversial circumstances to Guam then Seattle. He now awaits trial on 40 charges of cyber fraud which he is denying. He is accused of hacking into the computer systems of restaurants and businesses to steal millions of credit card numbers. Mr Seleznev senior has accused the US of arresting his son with a view to exchanging him for Edward Snowden, the US whistleblower who disclosed America's electronic snooping techniques. 'They probably decided to swap one nerd for another,' he said.","Russian MP Valery Seleznev has been married 'multiple times'

"Ukip has surged to a record level of support in the wake of Brussels’ demands for an extra £1.7billion from Britain. Some 19 per cent of people now say they will back Nigel Farage’s party, twice the level seen early last year. Mr Farage last night said the EU should be told to ‘get stuffed’ and said the demand had been a 'gift' to his party. The rise of Ukip has come at the expense of both the main parties, with Labour slumped at the lowest level of support since Ed Miliband became leader. Ukip has jumped four points to 19 per cent - one point above their previous highest rating in a ComRes telephone poll in June . The new ComRes survey for The Independent puts Labour neck and neck with the Tories on 30 per cent. It means Mr Miliband has dropped five points in just a month, his worst rating ever as leader. At the same time backing for Ukip has jumped four points to 19 per cent - one point above their previous highest rating in a ComRes telephone poll in June. The Liberal Democrats are down one point on 9 per cent and the Greens unchanged on 4 per cent. Ukip appears to have been bolstered by the huge row over the demand that Britain pays an extra £1.7billion to the EU by December 1. Nigel Farage said the demand for an extra £1.7billion from Brussels had been a 'gift' to Ukip . Ed Miliband has seen support for Labour slump to its lowest level since he became leader, and is now neck and neck with David Cameron's Tories on 30 per cent . David Cameron yesterday insisted he will not meet the deadline, but suggested Britain could end up handing over hundreds of millions of pounds. He told MPs that the row had undermined public support for the EU. Despite his combative stance in the Commons, the Prime Minister appeared to shift his position by saying it was the ‘scale’ of the cash demand that was unjustified. However Mr Farage said he would tell the European Union to “get stuffed quite frankly”. He told ITV’s The Agenda: ‘Quite honestly politically it's a gift to Ukip… The Prime Minister was very clear. ‘We will not be paying this money before the first of December. ‘What he really means is they won't pay it until after the Rochester by-election. Then we will pay it because those are the rules of the club. ‘Either we abide by those rules or we say the club's not for us… I wouldn't pay it today. Never.’ Budget commissioner Jacek Dominik said it would be 'extremely difficult' for the Prime Minister to challenge the EU's demand for extra cash. Mr Dominik said the move risked opening a 'Pandora's box' which could put the future of the UK's £3billion-a-year rebate in question. But in a statement to the House of Commons this afternoon Mr Cameron said: ‘Britain will not be paying two billion euros to anyone on December 1 and we reject this scale of payment.' And in a clear indication that he believes the row has undermined public support for EU membership, Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘For those of us who want to argue that the European Union is capable of reform, this was not a good development.’","Eurosceptic Ukip hits 19%, the highest level in a ComRes telephone survey .

"Found? Police say remains found in Idaho might belong to Josh Reddington who vanished in 2000 . A dismembered body found in an isolated cabin in Idaho appears to be a man who vanished 14 years ago after he was last seen with the son of a Chicago hitman, police have said. Skeletal remains that were discovered in an isolated cabin near Idaho City likely belong to Josh Reddington, from Salmon, who was 25 when he disappeared in 2000, Idaho State Police said. He was last seen with Michael Dauber, 45, who was arrested in March on suspicion of the murder of another man, his roommate Steven Kalogerakos, who was shot dead in December 2007. Dauber, who remains locked up, is the son of notorious mafia hitman William 'Billy' Dauber, who was gunned down with his wife in 1980. Kalogerakos' dismembered body parts were uncovered last year in a makeshift grave in rugged mountainous terrain near Idaho City, prosecutors have said. At his bond hearing for Kalogerakos' death, Boise County Prosecutor Ian Gee said Dauber had chopped up Kalogerakos using an axe and a bone saw. He then put the pieces into a plastic bag and dumped the evidence into a shallow grave several miles from Idaho City, the prosecutor said, the Boise Weekly reported. No one has yet been charged in Reddington's death, which 'appears to be a homicide,' Idaho State Police said. Dauber has long been referred to as a person of interest in the case. It will be several weeks before a positive identification can be obtained and evidence analyzed to determine a cause of Reddington's death, they said. Like father like son? Reddington was last seen with Michael Dauber, left, who is in jail for allegedly killing and dismembering his roommate in 2007. His father, Billy Dauber, right, was a Chicago mobster in the 70s and died in 1980 alongside his wife in a hail of bullets when his relationship with his bosses turned sour . His mother, Vera Pohto of Salmon, said authorities had contacted her earlier this week to ask her son's shoe size and later confided that they strongly suspected the remains belonged to him. 'I want to know if it is him for sure but I feel in my heart it is him,' she said on Wednesday. 'It's a relief to know he has been found even though his body has been all chopped up.' Reddington, a helicopter logger, was last seen by his mother just before Memorial Day weekend in 2000 when he and Dauber stopped in Salmon before traveling to Idaho City for work, Pohto said. Searches over the years led nowhere and police had no new leads when the sheriff in Salmon attended an FBI workshop on disappearances and serial killers and asked state and federal authorities to reopen the cold case, she said. Killed: Steven Kalogerakos was shot dead and dismembered in 2007 before the pieces of his body were dumped in a ditch near Idaho City. His remains were found last year and Dauber Jr. was arrested in March . Dauber Sr. was suspected in more than 30 unsolved murders between throughout the 70s. In 1973, he was convicted of mail fraud and transporting a stolen car across state lines. After his release, his relationships with his former fellow mobsters soured. In July 2, 1980, he was driving back from court on gun charges when a group of men in a van shot at his car and he crashed into a tree, the Chicago Tribune reported. Both he and his wife died. Michael Dauber was just 12 when his father and stepmother were killed. He moved to Idaho in 1994 and Kalogerakos, who he'd known since he was a boy, lived with him for three months before his death.","Skeletal remains have been found in a cabin near Idaho City and likely belong to Josh Reddington, who vanished in 2000, police said .

The TV star described the idea of a levy on properties worth more than £2million as ‘fatuous’. Under Labour’s proposals, owners of homes worth between £2million and £3million would pay £3,000 a year extra in tax. Owners of homes worth more than £3million could pay as much as £30,000 extra per year. Rhys Jones, 60, who made his name in shows such as Alas Smith and Jones alongside comedian Mel Smith, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘It would mean I’d be paying the most colossal tax, which is obviously aimed at foreigners who have apparently come in and bought up all the property in London.’ He added: ‘That sounds about as fatuous an idea as that immigrants are stealing all the jobs. I’d probably go and live abroad because I could get some massive palace which I could restore there.’ The presenter lives in a ‘gigantic’ house in Fitzrovia, central London, which he described as being a ‘slum’ when he bought it 15 years ago. He said it has appreciated so significantly in value that he may move overseas if Labour wins next May’s election. He is not the first wealthy celebrity to raise concerns about the proposed tax. Last month former England footballer Sol Campbell, 40, called the tax a ‘cheap and easy way to extract money from individuals who have done well’. It later emerged that the player had put his six-bedroom London home on the market for £25million. Rhys Jones made his fortune from founding production company Talkback Productions with Mel Smith. It now makes hit shows including The Apprentice and Never Mind The Buzzcocks. The Cardiff-born comedian has a track record of buying run-down properties and redeveloping them. He added: ‘I mustn’t equate my own personal angst about the mansion tax with a national policy angst. No way. It’s quite likely that the population is very keen on seeing rich people squeal. So I’m not going to squeal to make them feel better.’ Rhys Jones made his name in Alas Smith and Jones, pictured with co-star Mel Smith. The pair founded production company Talkback Productions, which has made hit shows including The Apprentice . The mansion tax proposal has also been criticised by Legal and General chief Nigel Wilson, who said it would punish savers who worked hard to own their own home. Around 90 per cent of affected homes are in the capital and Mr Wilson says the tax would be ‘anti-London’. Last week he said Labour was ‘pandering to the politics of envy’. He fears that Ed Miliband’s pledge to impose a tax on homes worth more than £2 million would exacerbate the housing shortage and make it hard for first-time buyers to get a foot on the property ladder. The top end of the property market has already slowed due to the threat of a levy and the drop in sales could reduce the amount of houses being built, he added. Ed Miliband has pledged to impose a tax on homes worth more than £2 million if Labour wins the next election .","The TV star, 60, lives in a 'gigantic' house in Fitzrovia, central London .

"High profile Hillsong senior pastor Brian Houston is expected to give evidence at an inquiry into how Pentecostal churches responded to child sex abuse allegations against his father Frank Houston and two other men. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual abuse sitting in Sydney on Tuesday will hear how Hillsong and the Pentecostal association, Assemblies of God, responded to abuse allegations against William Francis 'Frank' Houston - the famous preacher behind the movement which gave birth to the mega-church. His son Brian Houston was national president of the Assemblies of God (AoG) in Australia from 1997 to 2009. More than 1000 Pentecostal churches are affiliated to the AoG which is now commonly known as Australian Christian Churches (ACC). Hillsong senior pastor Brian Houston (pictured) is set to give evidence at the Royal Commission on child sex abuse and respond to allegations against his father Frank Houston . Hillsong, in Sydney, was created when separate churches run by father and son merged under the leadership of Brian Houston . Brian Houston was president in 2000 when his father admitted he sexually abused a boy in New Zealand 30 years earlier. Frank Houston was fired by his son from all church roles. Hillsong, in Sydney, was created when separate churches run by father and son merged under the leadership of Brian Houston. Frank Houston died in 2004 at age 82. Further allegations against him have come to light since his death. The charismatic preacher had been a Salvation Army officer in his native New Zealand before founding his first ministry at Lower Hutt near Wellington in 1960. 2000 was when Hillsong pastor Brian Houston's father (pictured) admitted he sexually abused a boy in New Zealand 30 years earlier. Frank Houston was fired by his son from all church roles . He later became superintendent of the New Zealand Assemblies of God before moving to Sydney in 1977. The commission will hear also of allegations against two other men and will be looking at the response of the ACC to those allegations. One of the men, a former youth pastor at a Sunshine Coast church, Jonathan Baldwin, was sentenced to eight years jail in 2009 when he was found guilty of repeatedly molesting a 13-year-old boy who had come to him for counselling. The other matter the commission will examine is the response of the Northside Christian College and the Northside Christian Centre, (now Encompass Church) to allegations of child sexual abuse made against former teacher Kenneth Sandilands. In a statement issued when the inquiry was announced Encompass Church pastor John Spinella said the church, based at Bundoora, Victoria, welcomed the inquiry. 'As a church we have recognised these past failures and take the opportunity to apologise for the suffering and pain endured by those who were abused,' he said. The public hearing is expected to run for two weeks and will be the 18th held by the commission. The Hillsong Church in Waterloo.

"Pervert: Ronald Wotton called pupils to the front of the class where he abused them behind his desk . Primary school pupils made themselves sick with washing up liquid to try to avoid lessons with a teacher who sexually abused them in front of the whole class, a court has heard. When one child complained about Ronald Wotton, the headmaster at the Roman Catholic school did not believe that the allegation and made the pupil apologise to the abuser. Judge Howard Crowson, sitting at Teesside Magistrates Court, jailed the terminally-ill 73-year-old for five years. Wotton who sometimes uses a wheelchair admitted 17 counts of indecent assault, three counts of indecency with a male and one of indecency with a child over a 12-year period from the late 1960s. He was allowed to retire in 1980 when a new headmaster, who could not ignore the mounting allegations against the teacher, took over. Judge Crowson told Wotton, of Seaham, County Durham: “You were sadly operating at a time when, to most of the adult public, it was inconceivable for this type of offending to be committed by a teacher.” Wotton’s wife left him when he was forced to retire and he has lived in miserable isolation for 30 years, fearful that one day he would be prosecuted, the court heard. The police began investigating last year when one of his victims was inspired to speak out amid the publicity surrounding the Sir Jimmy Savile scandal, the judge heard. Detectives went to the school, which is not being identified to protect the anonymity of complainants, and traced Wotton’s pupils, kicking off an extensive investigation. Joanne Kidd, prosecuting, said that 27 made formal statements and 20 of them were represented on the indictment. One victim, now middle-aged, said Wotton was an authoritarian, strict and a bully who set his classroom out so he was behind a “huge desk” in front of the children. He would catch a child’s eye, ask them to come forward and while hidden behind the desk, he would sexually abuse them over their clothes while he asked in a low and sinister voice if their parents spanked them, the court heard. Wotton would rub his groin as he did so. Some complainants recalled almost daily abuse. Ronald Wotton arrives at court before getting into his wheelchair to be pushed into court and then prison . He would make children bend over in PE classes and stare at them and watch them get changed for swimming. It made for an “extremely abnormal” atmosphere in lessons, as children would keep their heads down to avoid making eye-contact with him. When one pupil “took the brave step” of informing the headmaster what was happening to her, the adult called her a “bold girl” and remonstrated with her, saying: “Mr Wotton would not do such things.” Miss Kidd said: “She forced her to go back to the classroom and apologise to Mr Wotton in front of the whole class.” Children would rarely tell their parents, but on occasions furious adults would go in to school and confront Wotton. But nothing was done and he carried on. Miss Kidd said: “Many of the complainants began to feign illnesses and in some cases swallow washing up liquid in order to vomit and avoid having to go to school.” The headmaster told one parent who had complained that the behaviour was “just Mr Wotton’s way of being friendly”, Miss Kidd said. The judge said: “No doubt she believed it, unfortunately.” The court heard the washing up liquid tip was passed down by older siblings to younger pupils who were warned about Wotton. Woolton makes as if to throw his suitcase at those waiting to see him sentenced for his heinous crimes . The teacher abused boys and girls, the judge, who sat at Teesside Magistrates’ Court because of its wheelchair accessibility, was told. One pupil said his way of avoiding the abuse was truancy, and as a result he missed out on “a significant amount of basic education” which he never caught up, the prosecution said. When he was arrested, Wotton said the abuse had not happened and he retired due to his deafness. But Miss Kidd said in reality he was “invited to retire” after the new headmaster had a discussion with the parish priest. “It was obviously dealt with in a very informal way,” she said. The judge was handed statements from victims, two of which were read out in court. One expressed bitterness towards the Catholic Church, saying: “They should have been there for us and should have listened.” She never told her staunchly Catholic parents as to have done so would have felt like betrayal. Another said: “It was a Catholic school and the culture was teachers were right and you did what you were told.” Tony Hawks, defending, said Wotton had been a pariah since he retired at a young age and had not worked again. He lived miserably and alone, the barrister said. “The defendant is thoroughly ashamed and disgusted by his behaviour,” he said. Wotton has inoperable cancer of the colon and groin and earlier this year he had been expected to die. He also has heart and digestive conditions and is profoundly deaf. The judge said children had not been believed and that allowed Wotton’s offending to continue. “That you felt able to operate in this manner in front of a classroom of children is reprehensible,” he said. The abuse was aggravated by him continuing in the face of “direct challenge”, the judge said. He jailed him for five years and imposed an indefinite Sexual Offences Prevention Order and a ban on him having contact with children without social services authority .","Ronald Wotton, 73, jailed for five years at Teesside Magistrates Court .

"A New York Times beat reporter just landed a book advance of over $1million for her debut novel, which she's been 'quietly writing,' the author announced Wednesday morning. Publisher's Weekly reports that Stephanie Clifford, 36, who currently covers the courts for the Times, also sold the film options to Everybody Rise shortly after the book deal. Clifford tweeted about the recently closed deal to her followers on Wednesday. Young author: Stephanie Clifford, 36, secured the deal for her book Everybody Rise for a reported seven-figure advance . 'Some personal news: I've been quietly writing a novel for years. St Martins bought it, & Fox 2000 took movie rights.' Charlie Spicer, executive editor of St Martin's Press, described the book as 'Edith Wharton meets Bonfire of the Vanities for the 21st Century.' Its 'flawed' protagonist claws her way up the social ladder among 'a new generation of heirs and strivers [who] are jockeying for social power' among society in the Upper East Side. After St Martin's Press closed on the deal, the publishing house turned around and got it optioned to Fox 2000. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the title comes from the Stephen Sondheim song Ladies Who Lunch. Heirs: Clifford's novel drew repeated comparisons to the work of Edith Wharton, who wrote novels such as The Age of Innocence casting subtle critique on the upper-class society of the East Coast . Clifford graduated from Harvard as an undergraduate, where she was the senior editor of The Harvard Crimson, the school's paper. She has worked on the business and media desks at the Times, reporting on retail, advertising and magazines, and before that was a senior reporter at Inc magazine.","Stephanie Clifford, 36, sold her novel Everybody Rise to St Martin's Press .

"Just like on Aussie soil it's a debate that has been brewing across the ditch as well. New Zealanders will get to vote twice over the next two years on whether the country should change its flag. The New Zealand government announced that next year, voters will choose their favourite alternative flag from among several options, and in 2016, they will vote on whether that alternative should replace the current flag. Some residents in New Zealand consider the current flag to be an unwanted relic from a colonial past and too similar to Australia's flag, while others, including many combat veterans, feel a deep attachment to it.

A group of patriotic New Zealanders who will have to decide whether to change the flag or keep it as it is . The current flag features the Southern Cross star constellation with Britain's Union Jack in the canton, or top left corner. Prime Minister John Key favours a change and promised to hold a vote if he was re-elected for a third term in September. And he did, his National Party storming to victory in a decisive win. 'Our flag is the most important symbol of our national identity and I believe that this is the right time for New Zealanders to consider changing the design to one that better reflects our status as a modern, independent nation,' said Mr Key on Wednesday.

Prime Minister John Key (pictured) said he favoured changing the design to a silver fern set against a black background . When Mr Key first raised the idea of a flag vote in March, he said he favoured changing the design to a silver fern set against a black background. It's an image that's popular among New Zealand's sports teams, including the national rugby squad, known as the All Blacks and the nation's netball squad called the Silver Ferns. The government said several alternatives will be chosen for next year's vote by a panel of 'respected New Zealanders' who will be nominated by a group of lawmakers from all political parties. The Prime Minister estimated the two votes would cost $26 million New Zealand dollars which is more than $23 million AU. Australians have also been subject of the flag debate for many years. There is the repeated question of whether we should take away the union jack and/or the southern cross, and make a complete change to the flag. The debate often arises with the subject of whether Australia should become a republic, although that idea was rejected in 1999, when a referendum kept the monarchy. But while the flag debate has been well talked about, the question has never actually been put to a vote. Not only New Zealand but Australia has been having the flag debate for years, which often arises with the subject of whether Australia should become a republic or not .","New Zealanders will get to vote twice over the next two years on whether the country should change its flag .

"George Osborne said today that if the Scottish Nationalists win the independence referendum they will not be able to keep their currency . The pound is not an asset to be divided up ‘as if it were a CD collection’ and an independent Scotland will not be allowed to share it, George Osborne insisted yesterday. The Chancellor was backed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats as he delivered a stunning blow to Alex Salmond’s dream of persuading Scots to vote to break away from the UK. In a highly unusual move, the top civil servant at the Treasury, Sir Nicholas Macpherson, agreed that sharing sterling with an independent Scotland would be ‘fraught with difficulty’. He concluded: ‘I would advise against entering a currency union with an independent Scotland.’ In a choreographed series of interventions designed to inflict maximum damage on the ‘yes’ campaign, Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander and Labour’s Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls also insisted they would never agree to share the pound in a formal currency union. That would mean that if it wanted to continue to use sterling, an independent Scotland would be reduced to the position of a country like Panama, which uses the US dollar but has absolutely no say over the management of the currency, or Zimbabwe, which uses the dollar and the euro. The warnings prompted a furious reaction from the Scottish Nationalists - who issued an extraordinary threat to default on their part of the national debt in retaliation if they win the independence referendum taking place on September 18. Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ‘The debt is legally the Treasury’s. Scotland can’t default on debt that is not legally Scotland’s.’ She said the SNP wanted to keep the pound and enter into a formal ‘currency union’ with the remainder of the UK - but said there were other options, including using sterling without a currency union or adopting a new currency for Scotland. Danny Alexander, Chief Secreatry to the Treasury (left) and shadow chancellor Ed Balls (right) have both backed Mr Osborne's refusal to allow an independent Scotland to keep the pound . She insisted Mr Osborne was ‘bluffing’ and would moderate his position if Scots did back independence. But Mr Osborne insisted that while independence would expose Scotland to bigger economic risks, a currency union would oblige taxpayers in the remainder of the UK to bail them out if things went wrong. That prospect was ‘patently absurd’, the Chancellor said in a speech in Edinburgh. ‘If Scotland walks away from the UK, it walks away from the UK pound. ‘The SNP says that if Scotland becomes independent, there will be a currency union and Scotland will share the pound. People need to know that is not going to happen. ‘Because sharing the pound is not in the interests of either the people of Scotland or the rest of the UK.’ A letter from Sir Nicholas to Mr Osborne, released by the Treasury, also dismissed the prospect of a currency union with an independent Scotland. It is almost unprecedented for such politically contentious advice from a senior civil servant to be released. However Nicola Sturgeon (right) has hit back, suggesting that Osborne is 'bluffing', and will change his mind . Sir Nicholas warned that Scotland’s banking sector is too big in relation to national income, and the UK could end up having to bail the country out. He also told the Chancellor that the SNP’s threat to refuse a share of the UK’s debt is not credible. ‘Currency unions between sovereign states are fraught with difficulty. They require extraordinary commitment, and a genuine desire to see closer union between the peoples involved,’ the Treasury permanent secretary said. ‘What worries me about the Scottish Government’s putative currency union is that it would take place against the background of a weakening union between the two countries, running counter to the direction of travel in the eurozone. ‘I would advise strongly against a currency union as currently advocated, if Scotland were to vote for independence.’ Mr Alexander, the most senior Scot in the Government, challenged Mr Salmond to a debate on Scottish independence ‘any time, any place anywhere’ accusing the Nationalist leader of ‘cowering in his bunker’. Mr Salmond hit back, saying: ‘This is a concerted bid by a Tory-led Westminster establishment to bully and intimidate - but their efforts to claim ownership of sterling will backfire spectacularly in terms of reaction from the people of Scotland, who know that the pound is as much theirs as it is George Osborne’s.’","Three main parties have united in saying independent Scotland would not be able to use the pound in currency union .

"It turns out that bowl of ice cream or packet of crisps could be good for you after all. New research on successful slimmers shows that indulging in unhealthy treats while on a diet makes you more likely to reach your goal weight. The findings put to rest the myth that a diet of nuts and lettuce will get your into those skinny jeans quicker than a balanced diet. Scroll down for video . A new survey shows that indulging in unhealthy treats while on a diet makes you more likely to reach your goal weight (posed by model) In a survey of 2,600 Weight Watchers members, over half of whom have lost 10 per cent of their body weight, three quarters planned indulgence into their week. A third of all respondents went even further, revealing they treated themselves to unhealthy food at least once a day. 94 per cent of those questioned thought they were more likely to lose weight by incorporating indulgence into their plans as it helps to stay focused on the end goal - one in five said they’ve found they actually lose more weight on weeks when they include their favourite foods, . And the proof was in the (lack of) pudding - when questioned, half of the respondents who don’t let themselves indulge admitted they had gained a stone or more after a diet that involved deprivation. 94 per cent of those questioned in a WeightWatchers survey thought they were more likely to lose weight by incorporating indulgence into their diet (posed by model) Only a quarter of people who had tried this method of only-healthy dieting managed to stick with the rigorous regime for more than a month. Zoe Griffiths, Head of Programme and Public Health for Weight Watchers UK said: 'The common misconception is that you need to deprive yourself of the food you love, in order to see weight loss success. 'But the reality is, as soon as you tell yourself that you can’t have that glass of wine in the evening or a dessert after dinner, you start to want it even more. 'This explains why so many respondents only lasted a short amount of time on a ‘deprivation’ diet, it’s unsustainable. “At Weight Watchers we know that life just isn’t fun when you deprive yourself of the foods you love and, in actual fact, allowing yourself to indulge as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle is much more effective.'","New survey by WeightWatchers shows some indulgence helps weight loss .

"A group of mothers are campaigning to remove an inappropriate range of Kardashian Kids clothing from the shelves of all Babies 'R' Us stores. Kansas-based mother Amie Logan started an online petition asking the retailer to remove the 'damaging' garments after seeing the new collection, which is designed for baby girls aged zero to 24 months, on shelves and online. The campaign comes just one week after Babies 'R' Us' sister store Toys 'R' Us agreed to stop selling a line of Breaking Bad action figures, after parents accused the retailer of promoting drug use through the sale of the toys. Scroll down for video . Leading the charge: Kansas mother Amie Logan started the campaign to remove the inappropriate designs . Fashion faux pas: Many parents are outraged by the 'sexualized' nature of the designs . Appropriate? The Kardashian Kids collection includes this $23 pleather mini skirt . 'I don't want my child to grow up to be a Sex Tape star,' Amie wrote at the top of her petition, which is posted on Change.org. 'You pulled the Breaking Bad toys because they promoted Drug use. You should pull this clothing line because it promotes bad behavior as well. 'The madness has to stop. If the toys are damaging so is the clothing.' The collection, which is an extension of Kim, Khloe and Kourtney's globally-successful Kardashian Kollection for adults, includes a $25 leatherette mini skirt - with 'attached diaper cover' - a $33 fur faux animal print vest and a $23 leatherette skirt. Each of the designs, while not necessarily the personal handiwork of Kim, 34, Khloe, 30 and Kourtney, 35, have all been given the seal of approval by the sisters which is perhaps all the more disturbing given that Kim and Kourtney both have young daughters of their own. Kourtney welcomed her daughter Penelope, her second child with long-term partner Scott Disick, in July 2012, while Kim and Kanye West's daughter North was born on June 15 last year. At the time of writing, the petition, which is just a few days old, has already been signed more than 2,000 times by eager supporters, many of whom wholeheartedly agree with Amie's thoughts about the offending clothing designs.

Monique Smith from Greensboro, North Carolina, wrote: 'Babies don't need to look like porn stars' while Liz Thomas from Gainesville, Florida added: 'Breaking Bad toys are nowhere near as damaging to a young psyche as sexualization at such a young age. 'These people should be ashamed.' The campaign has also convinced some people to boycott the store entirely, with one mother commenting on the petition: 'Disgusting. I had no clue. I was just looking at starting my baby registry at Babies R Us last night. I am so glad I saw this first. Kardashian controversy: While Khloe, Kim and Kourtney did not design each of the garments themselves, each item of clothing has been given their seal of approval .

As the giant tech company scrambled to fix a software glitch that left some of its new iPhones unable to make calls, some analysts said Thursday that Apple is doing the right thing by quickly acknowledging and apologizing for the problem - which it was slower to do with earlier iPhone problems. 'There's a certain perception that Apple has to get things right, and when they don't, the whole company gets questioned,' said Carolina Milanesi, chief of research at Kantar Worldpanel. 'But they came out and said ""We apologize; we're working 24/7 to fix it."" I think that's what matters.' 'All major companies have released fixes that they've had to pull because of unforeseen side-effects,' veteran tech analyst Ross Rubin of Reticle Research said. Problems: Social media and online forums have been abuzz with comments about how the new phones can bend when placed in back pockets or while wearing skinny jeans . As for the bending issue, Rubin said the iPhone 6 Plus is 'a large, thin device. That's not to say customers should treat it gingerly, but it's still an electronic product and it's an investment, and it should be treated as such.' Apple is held to a higher standard by many consumers, analysts said. But Milanesi said she thought the company suffered more harm a few years ago, when it was slow to acknowledge complaints about poor reception and dropped calls that affected new iPhone 4 models when they were released in 2010. The company eventually offered a fix for the problem, after then-CEO Steve Jobs initially suggested users just needed to hold the phone differently. 'There wasn't any of that this time,' Milanesi said. She noted that Jobs' successor, CEO Tim Cook, had also taken responsibility and apologized for initial problems with Apple's Maps software when it was first released. Meanwhile, one analyst said Thursday's stock sell-off was more likely related to broader market concerns than investor unease about the new iPhones. 'Earnings is what drives the stock the most,' said Walter Piecyk of BTIG Research. 'It's too early to say what the impact's going to be, but it does not appear to be something that would impact the company's ability to deliver on earnings' in the next two quarters.","Apple Inc released a new software update  after some users of its new iPhone 6 complained of call service disruptions and other problems due to a previous update .

"Campaign: Laura Perrins (pictured with her son), of Mothers at Home Matter group,  said any recognition of the cost that families bear would be welcome . A ‘silent army’ of stay-at-home parents and people who care for relatives should be offered tax breaks to match those for working couples, say senior Tories. A group of centre-ground MPs will use next week’s party conference to put pressure on Chancellor George Osborne to boost tax breaks for marriage and extend them to carers. They will complain about the ‘discrepancy’ between generous support for working couples with children and that for families where one parent stays at home. The MPs include former Cabinet minister Caroline Spelman, John Glen, a member of the No 10 policy board, Jeremy Lefroy and Fiona Bruce. From autumn 2015, the Coalition has committed to introducing ‘tax-free childcare’ for dual earner couples, worth up to £2,000 per child. Such families will be able to open online accounts, run by HM Revenue and Customs, and National Savings and Investments. Any money paid in will attract a subsidy from the Government and the accounts can then be used to pay any registered childcarer. The subsidy will be worth up to 20 per cent of childcare bills for families earning up to £300,000 where both are in jobs. But some Conservative MPs say it is unfair that the tax breaks will not be available to couples in which only one parent earns. The Chancellor is introducing a marriage tax allowance from next April designed to help one-earner couples, but it will be worth only around £200 a year. It will only apply to people paying the basic rate of tax, meaning families with incomes above around £42,000 a year will not be helped. Laura Perrins, of campaign group Mothers at Home Matter, said: ‘We would welcome any recognition of the cost that families bear when they care for their children themselves and choose not to outsource those costs. 'At the moment, the system is very much skewed in favour of compensating for those with external childcare costs.’ The MPs will also call for more generous respite care payments to ease the burden on people looking after friends and relatives. The group of MPs, which includes minister Caroline Spelman, will use next week’s party conference to put pressure on Chancellor George Osborne (above) to boost tax breaks for marriage and extend them to carers . They back tax breaks for what they call ‘unsung heroes’ of social care, saying that where carers work part-time they should be able to reduce their tax bills in return. The MPs’ report will point out that the value of informal care carried out by family members and friends is estimated at £119billion a year. Some 6.5million people in the UK are caring unpaid for an ill, frail or disabled family member or friend, and the number providing unpaid care of 50 or more hours per week has increased by 26 per cent over the past decade. Mr Lefroy said: ‘We have a silent army of informal carers … motivated solely by commitment to their family members or friends. 'The difficulty lies with families who want to care for their own relatives, but whose financial situation prevents it. ‘The maximum they can claim presently is £60 through the carers’ allowance … They cannot set the financial value of their care against their own tax bills or those of their spouse. ‘They may then have to put their relatives in a full-time nursing home, at a cost of up to £60,000 a year to the state.’ He added: ‘This is not about expensive state hand-outs, but recognising and supporting these unsung heroes who provide care because of their selfless commitment to their families.’ Mrs Bruce said the Government ‘needs to go further to help those taking responsibility for the care of their families’. The report will also voice concern over rising levels of personal debt, which has trebled since 1993, reaching £158billion in 2013. The MPs recommend strengthening affordability tests for lenders, and a cap on the total amount repaid on a loan. David Cameron has suggested that a majority Tory government would go further than a marriage tax break, calling it ‘very much a first step’.","Senior Tories say stay-at-home parents and carers should have tax breaks .

"It had all the makings of a public-health horror story: an outbreak of a wildly deadly virus on the doorstep of the nation's capital, with dozens of lab monkeys dead, multiple people testing positive, and no precedent in this country on how to contain it. Americans' introduction to the Ebola virus came 25 years ago in an office park near Washington Dulles International Airport, a covert crisis that captivated the public only years later when it formed the basis of a bestselling book. Initially thought to be the same hyper-deadly strain as the current Ebola outbreak that has killed hundreds in Africa, the previously unknown Reston variant turned out to be nonlethal to humans. But the story of what might have been illustrates how far U.S. scientists have come in their understanding of a virus whose very name strikes fear, even in a country where no one has fatally contracted it. Containing the outbreak: This handout photo provided by Dr. Jerry Jaax, taken in Dec. 1989, shows the Veterinary Medicine Division team from US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in the hot zone, Nonhuman primate quarantine facility in Reston, Virginia where experts briefly feared an Ebola outbreak had begun on U.S. soil . inspiration: Jaax and the his story helped to inspire a 1995 Dustin Hoffman film in which Ebola comes to U.S. shores . Gerald Jaax, one of the leaders of a team of Army scientists that responded to the 1989 outbreak in Reston, Virginia, closely watched the meticulously planned transfers this month of two American aid workers from Liberia to a specialized facility in Atlanta, the first Ebola patients ever brought to the U.S. Jaax recalled his days urgently trying to corral the country's first known outbreak. In the fall of 1989, dozens of macaques imported from the Philippines suddenly died at Hazelton Research Products' primate quarantine unit in Reston, where animals were kept and later sold for lab testing. Company officials contacted the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Maryland — Jaax's unit — concerned they might be dealing with an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever among the monkeys. Initial testing revealed something much worse: Ebola, specifically the Zaire strain, which had a 90 percent fatality rate in humans. Four workers at the quarantine facility tested positive for exposure to the virus. Amazingly, they never even got sick. Researchers eventually realized they were dealing with a different strain, one now known as Ebola-Reston. Though its appearance under a microscope is similar to the Zaire strain, Ebola-Reston is the only one of the five forms of Ebola not harmful to humans. But Jaax and his unit, including his wife Nancy , also a scientist, did not know that while at the monkey house. They just knew they had to clean it out, and do it while keeping a relatively low profile that wouldn't scare the neighbors. Vectors: In the fall of 1989, dozens of macaques imported from the Philippines suddenly died at Hazelton Research Products' primate quarantine unit in Reston and were later found to have a strain of Ebola . 'You could walk in and smell monkey everywhere,' said Dr. C.J. Peters, who oversaw the Army's response to the outbreak. 'There was a little shopping center nearby. ... There was plenty of opportunity for trouble.' While the Army scientists had strong protocols in place for studying viruses safely in a lab, they were not well prepared to stabilize and contain an outbreak in a private facility. At the time, Jaax said, nobody — including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control — had that kind of experience. In the Reston incident, the CDC took the lead in managing the human-health aspect of the response, while the Army dealt with the monkeys. Back in 1989, there was concern that Ebola could spread through the air, said Peters, now a professor with University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Indeed, researchers concluded there must have been some sort of aerosol spread of the virus within the monkey house, Jaax said. Lesson learned: Gerald Jaax says one of the most important legacies of Reston was that none of the dozens who worked to contain the outbreak was exposed to the virus . The Reston animals had to be euthanized from a safe distance — 'monkeys are aerosol-producing machines,' Jaax said. In his 1995 book 'The Hot Zone,' Richard Preston described how Jaax modified a mop handle so it could be used to pin a monkey in its cage where it could safely be injected and eventually euthanized. Later, to disinfect the air, the team cooked formaldehyde crystals on electric frying pans. The Reston incident--along with an earlier Robin Cook novel of the same name--also became one of the inspirations for the 1995 Dustin Hoffman thriller Outbreak. Ebola is no longer thought to be an airborne virus; scientists say the disease can only be spread through direct contact with bodily fluids. The Reston crisis also elevated Ebola into the public consciousness, albeit not immediately. In an era when the country was preoccupied with the AIDS epidemic, which hit 100,000 cases in the U.S. that year, the Army and CDC scientists carried out their tasks in relative obscurity . It was only after 'The Hot Zone' became a best-seller and focused attention on the public-health battle to confront emerging disease outbreaks that the Reston event became well known and Ebola became a household word. 'The big difference between now and 1989 is that nobody else knew what Ebola was,' said Jaax, now an associate vice president at Kansas State University. One of the most important legacies of Reston, Jaax said, was that none of the dozens who worked to contain the outbreak was exposed to the virus. The plans developed on the fly to keep the responders safe worked, he said, and provided a good blueprint for the protocols used to bring back the American aid workers earlier this month. Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior associate at the UPMC Center for Health Security in Baltimore and an infectious disease physician, said the Reston responders' incorrect belief that they were dealing with a virus that was deadly to humans provided the ideal trial run for handling such an outbreak. 'It's like you're performing with a net underneath you, but you don't know it's a drill,' Adalja said. Ebola-Reston returned to the U.S. in 1996 in monkeys in Texas that had been imported from the Philippines. The Philippines has seen three outbreaks since the strain was identified, affecting primates, pigs and nine people. The workers who handled the animals developed antibodies, but did not get sick. Hazelton abandoned the Reston facility in 1990, and the company was later swallowed up by a competitor. The monkey house was torn down a few years later. The new building there hosts several small offices and a day-care center. Some of the office park workers are aware of the site's history; many are not. Back in 1989, Vicky Wingert worked at the local homeowners' association, in offices across the street from the monkey house. She said nobody had any idea there was a problem until people showed up in hazmat suits. Even then, very little information trickled out, she said. 'At the time, it wasn't a big deal. Looking back, it probably should have been,' she said.","Gerald Jaax is one of the Army scientists that responded to the in Reston, started by lab monkeys infected with a previously unknown strain of Ebola .

"They say you should never work with children and animals, but this hospital visit proves they are a winning combination. For National Children’s Week, a squad of cute and cuddly native wildlife were brought into Melbourne's Monash Children’s Hospital to put a smile on the faces of the sick children in the wards. A bashful wombat hides underneath hospital equipment, to the delight of one of the hospital's patients . Baby animals, feathered friends and native wildlife went on an excursion from Healesville Sanctuary to meet with some of their littlest friends.

It’s hoped the animals will bring some laughter and fun to wards, celebrating every young person’s right to childhood. ‘This is the fourth year we’ve brought some of our native wildlife to the wards of Monash Children;s Hospital and we’re thrilled to make the trip again,’ said Mr Glen Holland, Director of Healesville Sanctuary. Children of all ages were treated to a visit from the animals from Healesville Sanctuary . ‘We had a great time meeting the children and introducing our adorable friends to them,’ said a representative from Zoos Victoria. Professor Nick Freezer, Director of Monash Children’s Hospital, said the critters’ visit was eagerly anticipated. A baby wombat is given a gentle pat from one of the patients, who is participating in National Children's Week . The wombat proved popular amongst the youngsters enjoying World Children's Week at Monash Hospital . “Kids deserve a distraction from the reason they’re in hospital,” Professor Freezer said. “The children all know that tomorrow is the day the animals come to visit, and they’re all incredibly excited.” National Children’s Week is holding events around the country to focus on the needs and achievements of every child in Austalia. A baby wombat is right at home in the arms of a very happy patient from the children's ward . The campaign urges Australians to have a greater awareness and response to the plight of every child.

"Heather Dureen Hegre, 20, has been arrested over claims she stole a man's wallet on their first date . A 20-year-old Wisconsin woman faces theft charges after running off with a man's wallet on their first date. Heather Dureen Hegre struck up conversation with Jeffrey Mack, 23, from North Plains, Oregon, on the dating website MeetMe.com and the two met in person at around 10pm on Monday at an Arby’s restaurant in Wilsonville. Hegre apparently got into Mack's car at the drive-thru, where he bought her a milkshake. But when he placed his wallet down on the center console of the vehicle, Hegre grabbed it and disappeared. The Oregonian reports that there was only two $1 bills in the money holder - change from a $5 bill Mack used to buy the milkshake. After being robbed, Mack called 911 and provided police with Hegre's cellphone number. Officers then called to arrange a meeting with her at the same Arby's restaurant. They arrested her early Tuesday morning and recovered the wallet - with the two $1 bills still inside. Sergeant Dan Kraus of the Wilsonville Police Department told The Oregonian that Hegre confessed to taking the wallet. A subsequent search of her maroon minivan revealed hypodermic needles, two jars of hash oil, marijuana pipes, a weighing scale and a pill bottle containing what is believed to be methamphetamine. Scene of the crime: Hegre struck up conversation with Jeffrey Mack, 23, from Oregon on the dating website MeetMe.com and the two met in person at around 10pm on Monday at an Arby’s restaurant in Wilsonville .

"A bus driver taking 34 children on a school trip to Paris was arrested by French police after teachers allegedly spotted him drinking red wine in his cab. Staff from North Durham Academy, in Stanley, County Durham said they challenged the driver after seeing him drinking from a polystyrene cup and demanded he did a breath test using the on-board breathalyser kit during a lunch stop in Amiens. Shortly afterwards the British driver was arrested by French police on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. Teachers challenged the driver after allegedly seeing him drinking wine from a polystyrene cup and demanded he did a breath test  during a lunch stop in Amiens (pictured), in France . The British driver was arrested by French police on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol (file picture) He has since been released without charge. David Thornton, principal of North Durham Academy, said: 'It is unbelievable. I want to praise staff for acting on their suspicions and challenging the driver to make sure the children were safe.' Two staff went with French police to give evidence at the police station, while another two waited with children. The children were on a £300 three-night trip to the French capital, visiting the sights before singing with a school choir at Disneyland Paris on Sunday. Lisa Nattrass, whose 14-year-old son, Rhys Glendinning, is on the trip, said: 'When I was told by the academy there had been an incident I was close to tears, which soon turned to anger when I was told what had happened. 'I am thankful they are all okay and how great the staff were.' Teachers acted after suspicions were raised late yesterday afternoon and the man was arrested. The trip was booked though the School Travel Service and chartered from Travelsure, based in Belford, Northumberland. David Thornton (pictured), principal of North Durham Academy, described the incident as 'absolutely incomprehensible' Durham County Councillor Carl Marshall, who is a school governor at the £30million Academy, which opened last September, said: 'I am really pleased that all the children and young people are safe and can continue with their trip to Paris, which they have been looking forward to for a very long time.' In a statement, Travelsure said: 'An incident occurred on Friday afternoon in France in which a coach driver was alleged to have consumed alcohol whilst driving. 'The driver was requested by the teaching staff to take a breathalyser test, which he did and passed, using one of the two breathalysers carried on the coach, as specified by French law. 'The police had already been called and when they attended he was taken away for questioning. 'The driver has since been released without charge or fine. 'We are unable to comment further on the circumstances until we have carried out a full investigation and been able to speak with all parties involved to establish the true facts. 'This self employed casual driver has worked with us over many years and has always been reliable and professional.

"A mother has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity after a grand jury indicted her on three capital murder counts for the stabbing deaths of her three young daughters. Carol Ann Coronado, 30, was also charged with the attempted murder of her own mother in the indictment unsealed on Monday in Los Angeles, California. Coronado entered the insanity plea in a county court on Monday afternoon and is due to return for a hearing in three weeks. Carol Ann Coronado pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity on Monday to the murders of her three young daughters in California . Coronado allegedly killed her daughters - two-year-old Sophia (left), 16-month-old Yazmine (right) and two-month-old Xenia (center) at the family's California home in May . Authorities alleged Coronado killed her daughters - two-year-old Sophia, 16-month-old Yazmine and two-month-old Xenia - then tried to kill her own mother when she found them at the family home in Torrance on May 20. The indictment contains special circumstances allegations including multiple murders that make her eligible for the death penalty. At a previous hearing, Coronado's attorney said she was suffering from post-partum depression. She is due to return to court on October 17. In July, Coronado's husband spoke out in her defense, saying that his wife's undiagnosed condition was to blame for the tragedy. The mother-of-three was taken to a mental hospital after she tried to take her own life by stabbing herself in the chest, according to police. 'I'm not a doctor but I know for a fact that was that disease, and it wasn't my wife,' Rudy Coronado told NBC Los Angeles in early July. The grieving father revealed that there had been many warning signs before the murders but he did not know how to read them. ‘That's the reason why we need to bring awareness to [postpartum depression] because I was never educated on nothing like this,’ Mr Coronado said. ‘I didn't have a clue.’ He added that if it were not for the psychosis, his wife would not have hurt anyone 'in a million years'. This image shows Coronado's two older daughters and an ultrasound of her third child - who was just two months old when she was stabbed to death . Rudy Coronado (left) says if it were not for postpartum depression, his wife Carol, pictured right with their eldest daughter, Sophia, would have never killed their three children in May . Coronado vehemently defended his wife, describing her as a 'great woman.' ‘She doesn't deserve to be where she's at,’ he said. The devastated Rudy Coronado had previously told MailOnline: 'I don’t know why the hell this happened, she killed my babies man, she killed my babies,' as tears streamed down his face. 'It was like a demon possessed,' he continued. 'She was a girl with a good career ahead of her, I just don’t know why it happened. If I knew why it happened, it would answer all my questions.’ Carol Coronado's mother Julie Piercey, first discovered the children's butchered bodies covered in blood lying lifeless in the bed at around 5pm on May 20. The accused killer is said by investigators to have then gone at the woman with a knife. 'Oh my God!' Piercey is said to have screamed before wrestling the knife from the hands of her blood-spattered daughter. Husband Rudy was outside working on his car when the killings occurred. Police said Coronado was found naked and holding a knife after reportedly trying to cut her own wrists and stabbing herself in the chest. Several knives were recovered at a grisly scene. 'The babies were on the bed,' Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Dave Coleman said.'And not in a haphazard fashion, they were placed on the bed, so how and where they were killed, we're going to have to figure that out.' Sheriff's deputies took the mother, who was naked except for a blanket, to a patrol car and she was then placed in an ambulance, Madrid said. Mrs Coronado joined the U.S. Army after high school but only spent a few months in the service before being released due to an injury, Lt. Coleman said.","Carol Ann Coronado was also charged with the attempted murder of her own mother in Torrance, California .

"Struggle: Shawn Russ has opened up about life after he divorced his parents when he was 12 . It was an unprecedented court battle that saw 12-year-old Gregory Kingsley successfully divorce his parents and start a new life with a large, loving family under the name Shawn Russ. But 20 years after the case ended years of neglect at the hands of his biological parents, Russ has revealed that his struggles were far from over. In his first interview in more than 17 years, he has described how he slipped into an adolescence of drug abuse, arrests and depression as he attempted to come to terms with his fame and settle into normal family life. And, as he neared his thirties, demons still remained as he battled with the regret of never reconciling with his mother, Rachel, before her death in 2006. 'Winning the trial and being given a . family that loves me wasn't the answer to everything,' he told People magazine. 'I've been on this . quest just to be ordinary.' Russ, . who is now 32 and living in Webster, Massachusetts where he works in a . glass door factory, hit headlines as 'Gregory K' when he sought a . termination of parental rights in 1992. After . his biological parents divorced, he had been raised by his alcoholic . father and spent a life on the road, travelling through Colorado and . Florida and being handed from home to home. He . hardly had any relationship with his mother, who had given birth to him . at 18, and would sneak collect calls to her whenever he could. New life: Russ is pictured as a boy on September 25, 1992 after a judge granted him a divorce from his mother, who had abandoned him, and his father, an abusive alcoholic . When Russ was eight, his father . assaulted his girlfriend and he went to live with her and his two . younger brothers, Zachary and Jeremiah. The . arrangement lasted just months as, unable to cope, Rachel put him in . foster care - a move which deeply affected the young boy into his . adulthood. 'It took 28 years to come to terms with feeling abandoned by my mother,' he said. He . was sent to a boy's ranch, where he met attorney and child . welfare advocate, George Russ. Russ, who was also raised by an alcoholic father, already had eight children, but . 'something about Shawn rang a bell', he said. Pain: His mother, Rachel Kingsley, right, is comforted by her sister after the judge makes his ruling . Regret: Russ said he regrets never again speaking with Kingsley, pictured with her attorney at the hearing . In 1992, Shawn Russ, then known as Gregory Kingsley, became the first child to legally sever ties with parents. The televised case grabbed the nation's attention and set a precedent for fellow children after Russ said he hoped it would 'encourage other young people to take action to gain their happiness'. He even helped in the case of Kimberly Mays, a 17-year-old girl who was switched at birth in a Florida hospital in 1978. In 1993, the judge granted she could cut off all contact with her biological parents, who were trying to get full custody, as she wanted to stay with the man who had raised her as his daughter. In another high-profile case, Home Alone actor Macaulay Culkin 'divorced' his parents in 1997, when he was 16. Two years prior, his parents separated and fought over their children's earnings. Through his case Culkin gained control of his own wealth. In 1994, at age 14, actress Juliette Lewis also severed ties with her parents - but it was to side-step child labour laws and allow her to maintain a busy work schedule, rather than out of a bad relationship with her parents. The Russes invited the boy to their home and, on the second visit, he asked them to adopt him. He moved in with the family but struggled with their routine. The Russes remember him suffering from crippling self esteem when he was unable to do things the other children could, such as ride a bike. But as he began to settle in, taking saxophone and tennis lessons and camping with the Boy Scouts, his biological mother said she wanted him back and a legal battle was launched. It meant that, at age 11, Russ was flung into the spotlight, appearing on shows including Oprah as he explained that he wanted to sever ties with the woman who had abandoned him. 'It was crazy,' he recounted. 'I was this unwanted kid. I really didn't know much, and here I was on TV.' After a two-day hearing in Orlando, after Russ had turned 12, a . circuit court judge granted the boy's wish. His father had never . contested the case, but Rachel filed an unsuccessful notice of appeal. He returned . to the Russes home in Leesburg, Florida, with five new brothers, three . new sisters and his new adoptive parents, George and Lizabeth Russ. But . it wasn't easy to adjust. 'The fame came from a bad past,' he said. 'It wasn't an accomplishment of mine.' Feeling misunderstood, he fell in with a bad crowd in his teenage years and began dabbling in drugs to numb his depression, which led to two marijuana-related arrests, People reported. Battle: George and Lizabeth Russ speak out after winning custody of the youngster. George, an attorney, had met Shawn after his mother put him up for adoption and he was sent to a boys' ranch . Precedent: Russ carries legal papers into a courthouse to help Kimberly Mays divorce her parents in 1993 . He . dropped out of community college and moved out of the state to distance . himself from a place that reminded him of his old identity. But . throughout his struggles, his new family was there. 'They never turned their back on me,' he said. 'It developed my understanding of what a family is.' After moving from Florida, he . said he was careful whom he shared details of his past life with. But he . soon realised he was no different, as 'everybody has some type of pain . they've been through'. And after his biological mother's death . in 2006, he realised that part of his healing was overcoming the . regret he felt at never speaking to her following the court case. 'She . loved me,' Russ, who also has no contact with his biological brothers, . said. 'My mother was human and she made mistakes.' New family: Russ is pictured back left with his parents, George and Lizabeth, and some of his eight siblings. He said the way they always stood by him 'developed my understand of what a family is' As he has battled to put the pain of his childhood behind him, he and his siblings now agree he is the happiest he has ever been. He no longer suffers from depression and hopes to find a partner, marry and have children, fulfilling his ultimate dream to become a father, he told People. And he can now recognise the legal feat he made as an 12-year-old boy, and that he should be proud of what he achieved. 'My life hasn't been a fairy tale,' he said. But I'm happy. That's what matters.'","Shawn Russ hit headlines as a boy in 1992 as he divorced his mother, who had neglected him, and his abusive alcoholic father .

"James Packer's Crown casinos have copped a hiding from cashed up VIP gamblers - taking the Melbourne and Perth venues for more than $100 million in less than four months. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that Mr Packer has told his fellow shareholders at the annual general meeting that the high-rollers are flying on the tables at the moment. He told them 'the punters are killing us'. Scroll down for video . 'The punters are killing us' James Packer has told fellow Crown shareholders at the AGM . Billionaire James Packer (left) with Crown chief executive Rowen Craigie (right) 'Our VIP businesses are almost $100million below the theoretical result less than four months into the financial year due to an adverse win rate or put simply, bad luck,' Mr Packer said. He told shareholders of the Melbourne and Perth venues, that the results had been mixed. And as for the house always winning, Mr Packer told the meeting that the casino win rate of late had been 'poor'. The Sydney Morning Herald also reported that group chief executive Rowen Craigie told the AGM that local trading had been 'impacted by general softness in consumer sentiment' and that the roll of the dice had even affected Macau, which had suffered a slump. Mr Packer is Australia's third richest person with a reported wealth of $6.6billion. He has more than 50 per cent shareholding of Crown. High-rolling gamblers at Crown's Melbourne and Perth casinos have got lucky in the first quarter of the new financial year, leading to a result $100 million less than expected in the VIP business . His recent application for a new Crown Casino, slated for the redeveloped Barangaroo area of Sydney, was cleared in just three months by New South Wales authorities, which the body responsible for approval believed to be the fastest time in history. The billionaire is also reportedly close to signing a major, multi-million deal to buy-out Peter Holmes a Court's share of the South Sydney Rabbitohs and  join Russell Crowe as co-owner of the club. Negotiations between the parties are being finalised more than a year after they began, but have been kept silent in the hope that they would not disrupt the NRL club's tilt at a drought-breaking premiership.","James Packer tells Crown AGM: 'The punters are killing us'

"Robin Williams' suicide was a spontaneous act and was not planned out beforehand, according to a source close to the actor. A confidante of Williams said they had a conversation with the comic a day before his death in which the two spoke about several upcoming projects. The unnamed source said Williams had been 'completely engaged in the conversation' and was asking a lot of questions about the deals. Scroll down for video . Robin Williams suicide was spontaneous according to a confidante who says the pair discussed future projects the day before the comic actor was found dead . Speaking to TMZ, the source said: 'He [Robin] was unhappy which he often was, but it was nothing unusual... he lived in a dark place.' Williams' family believe that whatever caused him to commit suicide happened shortly before he hanged himself at his California home, the website reports. Since the actor was found dead a week ago today, several theories have surfaced as to why he might have taken his own life. The actor Rob Schneider, who was a long-term friend of Williams, said he believed the actor's suicide was brought on in part because of new medication he was taking to combat the onset of Parkinson's disease. Schneider tweeted: ‘Now that we can talk about it #Robin Williams was on a drug treating the symptoms of Parkinson’s. One of the side effects is suicide.’ The unnamed source said Williams had been 'completely engaged in the conversation' and was asking a lot of questions, indicating that he had not planned to kill himself . Experts say Parkinson’s disease can make symptoms of depression worse. America’s National Institute of Mental Health says on its website that people struggling with depression and Parkinson’s ‘suffer higher levels of anxiety and more problems with concentration’ than those suffering from only one of the ailments. Dr Jeff Bronstein, neurologist specialising in Parkinson’s, said: ‘Obviously getting the diagnosis can make people depressed but we also know there is a much higher incidence of depression even before the disease is recognised. We think it’s one of the early symptoms.’ However, a spokesman for Samaritans said: 'There is no simple explanation for why someone chooses to die by suicide, it is rarely due to one particular factor. 'Mental health problems are often a risk factor, as well as feelings of desperation and helplessness. 'We know that when a person is in crisis, they feel trapped in their situation with no way out, and that the future holds nothing good for them. They may not be able to see beyond their situation and truly believe that suicide is the only option for them.' It is believed that family members paid tribute to the actor at a private memorial service this weekend organised by his widow, Susan Schneider - who is not related to Rob Schneider. According to E! News, close friends and family arrived at the service in Tiburon, California, early on Saturday to pay their respects.

"The first Homira Baryalei heard that her son was an extreme Islamic terrorist was when the Australian Federal Police turned up on her doorstep in Sydney. Mohammed Ali Baryalei told his mother he was going to study in Turkey but it was during a police raid that she was told the shocking truth that her son was fighting in Syria. Despite her son proclaiming his innocence to his mother, the cold harsh reality unfolded as Mrs Baryalei continued to receive visits from ASIO and the police over the coming months. A warrant was put out for his arrest as it emerged Baryalei was recruiting fighters to the Islamic State's cause in Syria. Scroll down for video . Mohammed Ali Baryalei told his mother he was going to study in Turkey but it was during a police raid that the she told the shocking truth that her son was fighting in Syria . Despite her son proclaiming his innocence to his mother, the cold harsh reality unfolded as Mrs Baryalei continued to receive visits from ASIO and the police over the coming months . 'To be questioned and asked and probed and prodded about this, how do we move on from our lives?' asked another of Baryalei's close relatives, who asked not to be named, told The Australian. 'We haven't even done anything. I feel like we're guilty by association.' Homira Baryalei arrived in Australia more than 30 years ago as a young refugee from Afghanistan and raised four children in Sydney's northwest. Unbeknownst to his mother, Baryalei chose to leave the peaceful suburban streets to join terror group Jabhat al-Nusra then the Islamic State. Three weeks ago, Mohammed Baryalei was named by police as the instigator behind a plot to behead a member of the public in an Australian city which was to be filmed with the victim draped in the Islamic State's black flag. 'Why I run away from Afghanistan? I come to a peaceful country. I am living in this area 25 years or more and I'm very peaceful,' his mother said to The Australian. 'I'm say hello to everyone. I go shopping. I come to visit my kids. That's it.' Baryalei grew up with three siblings in Sydney's northwest . Mrs Baryalei said her son's conversion to radical Islam came after a period of drinking and taking drugs when he worked as a doorman at a Kings Cross strip club. He then entered a stable relationship and returned to Islam, working with the Street Dawah movement, a group of Muslims who recruited on the streets of western Sydney. This was when he began to complain of being harassed on the streets and decided he wanted to study in Egypt. 'This time, though, Egypt was very bad. That's why he said, ""I go to Turkey first. I want to see how much it costs me in university, I find good job. I go for two, three years, I want to study about Islam"".' But the 33-year-old went to Syria instead. Mrs Baryalei asked if her son would ever be able to come home. 'I ask Ali, he said, ""Mum, I'm not coming. They put me in the jail. Why I'm coming? I'm free here"", ' Ms Baryalei said.
