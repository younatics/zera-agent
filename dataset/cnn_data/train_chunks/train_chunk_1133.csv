"The widow of America's deadliest sniper has been ordered to pay Jesse Ventura $1.8million after losing a defamation suit over claims her husband made before he was murdered. Former Navy SEAL Chris Kyle claimed in his best-selling booked American Sniper that he punched  Ventura after the former Minnesota governor made disparaging comments about the military, including that the SEALs 'deserved to lose a few' over their behavior in Iraq. Kyle, who was murdered by a fellow veteran at a Texas gun range last year, defended his story in videotaped testimony before his death, saying it was accurate. Eleven witnesses also backed up Kyle's version of events, defense attorney John Borger told jurors. After Kyle's death in February 2013, Ventura filed suit against his widow, Taya Kyle, who inherited the estimated $6million that Kyle raked in from the book. Scroll down for video . Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura (pictured outside court last week, right) claimed he had lost work as a TV personality when Chris Kyle lied about him making disparaging remarks about the military . Losing side: Taya Kyle, the widow of American Sniper author Chris Kyle, was ordered pay out $1.8million over claims Kyle made in his book and on Fox News before his death. She is pictured here outside court last week . Kyle, who claimed he killed 255 Iraqi insurgents, shot to national fame with the publication of his harrowing book, American Sniper . After . deliberating for nearly six days, a jury in St. Paul, Minnesota, . returned a verdict against Kyle's estate - finding that the Ventura, . himself a Navy veteran, had been defamed by Kyle's account of the . 2006 encounter at a California bar. Ventura testified that Kyle fabricated the passage about punching him. Legal experts had said Ventura had to clear a high legal bar to win, since as a public figure he had to prove 'actual malice.' According to the jury instructions, Ventura had to prove with 'clear and convincing evidence' that Kyle either knew or believed what he wrote was untrue, or that he harbored serious doubts about its truth. The jury sent the judge a note Monday saying they didn't think they could reach a unanimous verdict. He told them to keep trying. After finding in favor of Ventura, the jury was also tasked with awarding damages for any harm to his reputation, humiliation and embarrassment. Jurors had to find that Ventura suffered an economic loss as a direct result of Kyle's statements, or that Kyle used Ventura to profit unjustly. The award includes $500,000 for defamation and $1.3 million for unjust enrichment. Neither Ventura nor Chris Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, were in the courtroom for the verdict. Taya is executor of his estate with control over proceeds from book royalties and movie rights. She grew up in Gladstone, Minnesota, and is the daughter of Lake Oswego Mayor Kent Studebaker. She and their two small children live in Texas. Tragic: Kyle, a decorated Navy SEAL was murdered by a fellow veteran at a Texas gun range in February 2013 . Best-seller: American Sniper sold millions of copies and made Chris Kyle more than $6million . In his closing argument, Ventura attorney David Bradley Olsen said he believes Kyle's estate has earned more than $6 million from the book, and suggested that $5 million to $15 million would be reasonable compensation for what he said was irreparable harm to Ventura reputation. 'The verdict will tell the world Chris Kyle's story was a lie,' Olsen said. Olsen said Kyle's claims that Ventura said he hated America, thought the U.S. military was killing innocent civilians in Iraq and that the SEALs 'deserve to lose a few' had made him a pariah in the community that mattered most to him - the brotherhood of current and former SEALs. 'One-point-five million people have bought the book,' he said. 'Millions more heard Fox TV trash Jesse Ventura because of it. And the story went viral on the Internet and will be there forever.' Defense attorney John Borger had told jurors in his own closing argument that the 11 witnesses presented by the defense 'tell a compelling and consistent story' that backed Kyle's version. U.S. District Judge Richard Kyle, who is not related to the author, told jurors they weren't charged with determining whether Ventura was punched, but rather whether he was defamed by the remarks Kyle attributed to him. Chris Kyle, regarded as the deadliest military sniper in U.S. history, included a brief account in his book of a confrontation at a bar in Coronado, California, with a man he called 'Scruff Face.' In promotional interviews, Kyle identified the man as Ventura, a former Navy special operations diver who became a pro wrestler and movie actor before being elected for one term as Minnesota governor in 1998. Ventura was in Coronado for a SEAL reunion and graduation ceremony. Ventura is a former professional wrestler who went by the name 'The Body.' Defense lawyer argued he already had a complicated public image . Leading man: Bradley Cooper is set to play Kyle in the upcoming Hollywood adaptation of American Sniper . Ventura's lawyer said inconsistencies in testimony from defense witnesses about what happened the night of October 12, 2006, were so serious that their stories couldn't be trusted. He also pointed out that people who were with Ventura that night testified that the alleged confrontation never happened. And he said Ventura would never have said any of the remarks attributed to him because he remains proud of his and his parents' military service. 'The statement is completely out of character for Jesse Ventura. He never said anything like that in his life, and he never will,' he said. Ventura testified that his income as a television personality fell sharply as job offers dried up in the wake of American Sniper. Borger said Ventura's career as an entertainer was in decline well before that.","Chris Kyle, a former Navy SEAL, claimed in his book American Sniper that he punched Ventura at a SEAL bar in California in 2006 .

"Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas told a group of college students on Tuesday that race and gender relations are worse now than when he was a kid in a segregated Georgia. According to Yahoo News, at Palm Beach Atlantic University in West Palm Beach, Florida, Thomas, the second black justice to serve on the court, lamented how society is more 'conscious' of racial differences than it was when he grew up in segregated Georgia before and during the civil rights era. The conservative justice who, among other things, has written opinions supporting limits on Affirmative Action, added that 'the worst things that have been done to me, the worst things that have been said about me, by northern liberal elites, not by the people of Savannah, Georgia.' Speaking out: Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas told a group of college students on Tuesday that race and gender relations are worse now than when he was a kid . The justices of the U.S. Supreme Court: Thomas, the second black justice to serve on the court, lamented what he considers a society that is more 'conscious' of racial differences than it was when he grew up in segregated Georgia in the days before ¿ and during ¿ the civil rights era . The justice spent some of his childhood in Georgia when public facilities in his home state of Georgia were segregated by race, Ku Klux Klan billboards were up and didn't dare set foot in parts of Savannah. His second wife Virginia, to whom he's been married since 1987, is white. Yahoo News reported that he equated racial injustice with the day-to-day unfairness of life, criticizing the amount of focus placed on racial issues in national discussions. 'My sadness is that we are probably today more race and difference-conscious than I was in the 1960s when I went to school.' Outspoken: The conservative justice who, among other things, has written opinions supporting limits on Affirmative Action, added that 'the worst things that have been done to me, the worst things that have been said about me, by northern liberal elites, not by the people of Savannah, Georgia.' Summing it up: Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas equated racial injustice with the day-to-day unfairness of life, criticizing the amount of focus placed on racial issues in national discussions . 'To my knowledge, I was the first black kid in Savannah, Georgia, to go to a white school. Rarely did the issue of race come up,' Thomas said during the service hosted by the nondenominational Christian university. 'Now, name a day it doesn’t come up. Differences in race, differences in sex, somebody doesn’t look at you right, somebody says something. Everybody is sensitive. If I had been as sensitive as that in the 1960s, I’d still be in Savannah. Every person in this room has endured a slight. Every person. Somebody has said something that has hurt their feelings or did something to them — left them out.' 'That’s a part of the deal,' he added. In his 2007 memoir, 'My Grandfather's Son,' he described his experience growing up as an African-American Catholic in Georgia during the Jim Crow era. 'I was a two-fer for the Klan,' he said. After leaving the church for awhile he reconciled with Catholicism in the mid-1990s after become someone disenchanted with it while at Holy Cross. Thomas moved north from Georgia for college and graduated from Yale Law School in 1974 after marrying his college sweetheart in 1971. Straight-talking: To my knowledge, I was the first black kid in Savannah, Georgia, to go to a white school. Rarely did the issue of race come up,' Thomas said during a chapel service in Florida . He went on to a successful judicial career that took him all the way to the Supreme Court. Along the way he claims to have experienced more discrimination in the North than the South. 'The worst I have been treated was by northern liberal elites. The absolute worst I have ever been treated,' Thomas said. 'The worst things that have been done to me, the worst things that have been said about me, by northern liberal elites, not by the people of Savannah, Georgia.' In his autobiography, Thomas recalled his rocky confirmation being worse than his childhood growing up under segregation, writing, 'my worst fears had come to pass not in Georgia, but in Washington, D.C., where I was being pursued not by bigots in white robes but by left-wing zealots draped in flowing sanctimony.'","Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas said Americans are more 'sensitive' about race now than in the 1960s .

"One of two Austrian teenage 'postergirls' who flew to Syria in April to join Islamic State ranks is believed to have been killed. Samra Kesinovic, 16, and her friend Sabina Selimovic, 15, vanished from their Vienna homes earlier this year. Soon afterwards they posted images of themselves branding Kalashnikov rifles, surrounded by armed men - photos which Austrian police feared were acting as militant recruitment posters for young girls. Left is Samra Kesinovic, 16, who is thought to have fled to Syria to join the Islamic State. On the right is 15-year-old Sabina Selimovic who went with her - it is believed one of the girls is now dead . Samra Kesinovic and Sabina Selimovic in a photo they posted online. Last week, police expressed their fears that the two were inspiring other girls to flee to Syria to take up holy war . It is not yet known which one of the teenagers has been killed as the death is yet to be officially confirmed by the Austrian government. Alexander Marakovits, spokesperson for the Interior Ministry, told The Salzburger News: 'We also have this information and have checked it, but cannot say with absolute certainty that it is true. 'But the parents have been informed their daughter could be dead.' Konrad Kogler, Director General for Public Security, also confirmed there were unverified rumours of the death on Sunday evening's ORF program 'In the Centre', The Local reports. The motivations of the two Bosnian girls are unclear but before leaving, they had contact with Chechen youths, and visited a mosque in Vienna's second district. And last week, police expressed concerns that the pair were inspiring their contemporaries after two other teenage girls were caught attempting to flee the country to join IS ranks . Samra Kesinovic and Sabina Selimovic in another photo they posted online, sometime after they fled Austria . Austrian media warned several weeks ago that the girls had become the public face for the call to jihad. The fears appeared to be validated with the Austrian Interior Ministry confirming two other girls from Vienna had attempted to flee to take up the call for holy war. Little information was given about the latest pair hoping to join Islamic State apart from the fact that one was 16 and the other was 14 and their parents were apparently from Iraq. Police now want to find out how they became radicalised, and whether anybody had helped them plan their trip to Syria which was apparently set to take place via Turkey - following the same route as the other two girls. The pair were caught when the mother of a third friend who was supposed to be travelling with them became suspicious about the amount of luggage her daughter was packing. Sabina, pictured beside jihadists wielding Kalashnikov rifles, somewhere in Syria or Iraq . It's not known if they group were in contact with Samra and Selimovic, who - despite the fact they are being hunted by Interpol - have remained missing. However, social media updates posted by the two show them dressed in traditional Muslim clothing and in some instances, standing beside men holding guns. As many as 130 people from Austria are now believed to be fighting as jihadists abroad. More than half of Austrian's jihadists originally come from the Caucasus region and have a valid residence permit in Austria. Meanwhile, two Salafists were intercepted in a German border town on the way to Syria via Austria. Austrian Interior Ministry spokesman Alexander Marakovits said they were noticing an increasing problem with youngsters wanting to leave the country for the same reason. He said: 'If we can catch them before they leave we have the chance to work with their parents and other institutions to bring the youngsters out of the sphere of influence that prompted them to act in this way the first place. 'Once they have left the country, even if they then changed their minds, it is then almost impossible to get them back.'","Two teenage girls vanished from homes in Austrian capital Vienna in April .

"More than 1,600 new employees hired by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Resources in the aftermath of Obamacare's passage include just two described as 'consumer safety' officers, but 86 tasked with 'criminal investigating' – indicating that the agency is building an army of detectives to sleuth out violations of a law that many in Congress who supported it still find confusing. On the day President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010, HHS received authority from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to make as many as 1,814 new hires under an emergency 'Direct Hiring Authority' order. The Obama administration ordered that employment expansion despite a government-wide hiring freeze. U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, left, discusses the Affordable Care Act at a news conference on Aug. 13, 2013 . A total of 1,684 of those positions were filled. An analysis by MailOnline shows that at 2010 federal government salary rates, the new employees' salaries alone cost the U.S. at least $138.8 million every year. Had the agency filled all its available jobs, that cost would have been a minimum of $159 million. The hiring began in May 2010 and continued through June 2013, making the later hires eligible for higher salaries as a result of annual cost-of-living increases. The difference between what HHS spent on new Obamacare-related employees and what it was authorized to spend is explained by its failure to hire most of the 261 'consumer safety officers' it was authorized to bring aboard. Only two such employees were hired. But while OPM authorized HHS Deputy Assistant Secretary for Human Resources Denise Carter -- later renamed Denise Wells -- to hire 50 criminal investigators, the agency increased that number to 86 on its own. After MailOnline lodged a Freedom Of Information Request with HHS, the agency sent a spreadsheet containing records of the positions it filled, along with the salary level for each one on the government's 'GS' hiring scale. On the day President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010, HHS received authority to make 1,814 new hires. Obama is pictured here on August 15 . The lowest salary on the list was for a single contracting officer at Grade 7, Step 1, an annual rate of about $42,350, including a so-called 'differential' payments. Those increases are given to all federal employees in order to adjust for regional cost-of-living differences. The highest salary in 2010 dollars, including that differential payment, was about $161,450, earned by a total of 29 new employee. They include health insurance administrators, contracting officers and information technology managers. The fleet of 86 new criminal investigators are earning a range of compensation between $51,800 and $89,350, according to the 2010 salary tables and differential payment guidelines. Judicial Watch, a nonprofit that has told MailOnline it files 'hundreds' of FOIA requests, first published evidence in July of the HHS hiring binge. 'Sounds like we now have the Obamacare police,' said the group's president, Tom Fitton, after MailOnline showed him the new data. 'Given the confusion and problems of the law's implementation, we would need a small army to police all the waste, fraud, and abuse that is already evident.' Heritage Action for America, a conservative lobby group that opposes implementation of the Affordable Care Act, told MailOnline that it sees the hiring of criminal investigators inside HHS as a sign that its position is more and more defensible. 'The Obama administration continues to assert near unilateral power when it comes to Obamacare,' said Dan Holler, the group's communications director. 'This blatant disregard for the rule of law raises serious questions as to how these new criminal investigators will behave, what guidelines they will follow and who will provide much-needed oversight.' Heritage Action is circulating a letter this week, penned by freshman GOP Rep. Mark Meadows, calling on 100 House Republicans to 'take the steps necessary to defund Obamacare in its entirety, including on a year-end funding bill like a continuing resolution.' The Department of Health and Human Services didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, but it responded to MailOnline's FOIA request within the number of days the statute permits.","Post-Obamacare law hiring at the Department of Health and Human Services included 86 'criminal .

"President Barack Obama admitted that U.S. intelligence underestimated the Islamic State's emergence in Syria, and that breaking up the terrorist cell will be a complicated battle involving both military and political action. The president spoke about the multi-national effort against ISIS in a televised interview with 60 Minutes, which aired Sunday night. Citing earlier comments by James Clapper, director of national intelligence, Mr Obama acknowledged that U.S. intelligence didn't take seriously enough what had been taking place in Syria. 'Well I think, our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper, has acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria,' Mr Obama said. Conversely, the United States overestimated the ability of the Iraqi army to fight the militant groups, Obama said in the interview taped on Friday, days after the president made his case at the United Nations for action. Scroll down for video . President Obama says the US intelligence agencies underestimated Islamic State activity in Syria and overestimated the Iraqi army's role to fight back against militants . Islamic militants went underground when US Marines quashed al-Qaeda in Iraq with help from Iraq's tribes, he said. 'But over the past couple of years, during the chaos of the Syrian civil war, where essentially you have huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned, they were able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos,' Obama said according to a clip of the interview broadcast earlier. 'And so this became ground zero for jihadists around the world.' However, the president says he is now committed to breaking up ISIS in order to give the Iraqi people time to establish a stable democracy. 'It’s so important for us to recognize part of our solution here is going to be military,' Mr Obama said. 'We just have to push them back and shrink their space and go after their command and control and their capacity and their weapons and their fueling and cut off their financing and work to eliminate– the flow of foreign fighters.' Speaking to CBS's 60 Minutes, he said the militants had used the chaos of the Syrian civil war, when large swathes of the country were ungoverned, to 'reconstitute themselves' Obama outlined the military goal against the Islamic State: 'We just have to push them back, and shrink their space, and go after their command and control' Obama last week expanded U.S.-led air strikes, which began in Iraq in August, to Syria and he has been seeking to build a wider coalition effort to weaken the Islamic State. Currently, the U.S. is working with 60 other nations in these attacks against the terrorist group. Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates have helped fly missions, but the president admits that the U.S. is the country leading the coalition and he says that's 'always the case'. 'That's always the case. America leads. We are the indispensable nation,' Mr Obama said. 'We have capacity no one else has. Our military is the best in the history of the world. And when trouble comes up anywhere in the world, they don't call Beijing. They don't call Moscow. They call us.' Aftermath: Still image taken from black and white video from a plane camera shows smoke rising after a strike near Kobani, a strategic Syrian town near the Turkish border, on September 27. ISIS militants are attacking the town. The U.S. is currently leading airstrikes against the terrorist group with the help of some 60 other nations . The terrorist-group ISIS has been taking large swaths of Syria and Iraq in the recent absence of a permanent U.S. military presence in Iraq. Syrians marching with the black flag of the Islamic State in January, in the stronghold of Raqqa . Mr Obama added: 'When an issue ... when there's a typhoon in the Philippines, take a look at who's helping the Philippines deal with that situation. 'When there's an earthquake in Haiti, take a look at who's leading the charge and making sure Haiti can rebuild. That's how we roll. And that's what makes this America.' Mr Obama also spoke at length about what must be done in Syria, where ISIS looms large. The current tactic of bringing down the terrorist network is also beneficial to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which the U.S. has come out against for alleged war crimes. The president admits that Assad will benefit from the current campaign to dessimate ISIS. 'I recognize the contradiction in a contradictory land and a contradictory circumstance. We are not going to stabilize Syria under the rule of Assad...for a long-term political settlement, for Syria to remain unified, it is not possible that Assad presides over that entire process. 'On the other hand, in terms of immediate threats to the United States, ISIL, Khorasan group, those folks could kill Americans,' he said. The U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group is growing, with dozens of countries among its ranks. The coalition is contributing a wide range of efforts, from carrying out airstrikes to providing military assistance and humanitarian aid. Here are some of the key partners in the coalition. UNITED STATES . The U.S., which is leading the coalition, has launched dozens of airstrikes on Islamic State targets. It also has sent military advisers, supplies and humanitarian aid to help Iraqi troops and Kurdish forces beat back the insurgents. GULF STATES . Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have participated in airstrikes in Syria. A fourth, Qatar, has played what the Pentagon called a supporting role. The Emirates and Qatar also host air bases that are being used for the coalition's aerial campaign against the Islamic State group. U.S. Navy ships involved in the airstrikes are assigned to the Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet. Saudi Arabia has agreed to host training facilities for Syrian rebels on its territory. JORDAN . Jordan has launched airstrikes against Islamic State positions, with government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani calling the move ""necessary in light of continuous attempts to infiltrate our borders."" The kingdom didn't give any specifics about its operations, but said the airstrikes aim to insure the country's security. EGYPT . Egypt hasn't announced any specific participation in airstrikes, but President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi told the AP that Egypt is ""completely committed to giving support,"" and will do ""whatever is required"" to support the coalition. ISRAEL . Israel is offering intelligence estimates and concrete intelligence to the U.S. on the Islamic State group as part of ongoing intelligence sharing between the two countries, an Israeli defense official said. But, he added, Israel wasn't asked to contribute anything beyond that. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the issue. The prime minister's office declined to comment. BRITAIN . Britain said that Tornado fighter bombers, supported by air-to-air refueling aircraft and signals intelligence, are operating over Iraq. Britain's media has widely reported that six warplanes are on standby in Cyprus, but defense officials have declined to offer specific numbers. Ben Goodlad from IHS Jane's has said that the Tornado jets offer the coalition enhanced capability to engage moving targets. Britain also has two weapons for long-range strikes: the Tornado's Storm Shadow cruise missile and the submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missile, he said. FRANCE . France has carried out airstrikes in Iraq on two occasions since joining the U.S.-led coalition on Sept. 19, firing laser-guided bombs from Rafale fighter planes upon munitions and military hardware stockpiles — first near northern Mosul, then on Thursday, near Fallujah. France is conducting the operations in Iraq from a French air base in the United Arab Emirates. The base, with about 750 French service personnel and six Rafales, is 1,700 kilometers (1,050 miles) from Mosul, meaning that the planes need refueling in flight to strike in Iraq. AUSTRALIA . An Australian air force contingent, including eight F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters and two support aircraft, has arrived in the United Arab Emirates. About 600 troops — most of them air force personnel — are being deployed with the aircraft. The jets are expected to be used in airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in Iraq, although the Australian government has yet to commit to a combat role. BELGIUM . Six F-16 multirole fighters and a contingent of 120 support staff, including eight pilots, to be based in Jordan. Authorized to take part in operations over Iraq for one month, subject to extension if approved by the Belgian government. DENMARK . Denmark has pledged seven F-16 fighter jets — four operational planes and three reserve jets along with pilots and support staff for 12 months. The U.S. also has asked Danes to provide military trainers to Iraq to school Iraqi and Kurdish fighters battling the Islamic State group on the ground. Denmark has already contributed a transport plane with personnel to a U.S.-led humanitarian operation in northern Iraq. CANADA . Canada has contributed about 70 special operations soldiers to offer instruction to Kurdish forces battling Islamic State militants in northern Iraq. Early this week, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Cabinet will be considering a U.S. request to support airstrikes against Islamic State forces. This could include five to eight CF-18 fighter aircraft as well as tanker aircraft. Canada has already contributed two military cargo planes that carried weapons to Kurdish fighters. GERMANY . Germany isn't participating in any airstrikes against the Islamic State group. They have sent weapons to Kurdish fighters in Irbil, and a group of Kurdish peshmerga fighters arrived in Germany to receive weapons' training here by the German army. There's also German military in Irbil to train the peshmerga fighters in Irbil. GREECE . Greece is participating with humanitarian aid and by sending ammunition for Kurdish forces fighting the Islamic State group.

"(Stock image) The NHS Blood and Transplant Service is to offer alcoholics suffering from severe liver disease transplants for the first time . Alcoholics suffering from severe liver disease are to be allowed to have transplants on the NHS for the first time. The scheme will be controversial because there is a national shortage of suitable organs for transplant – and critics will say those who bring ill-health on themselves should not receive such help. The NHS Blood and Transplant Service's decision, announced last night, will affect those with 'severe alcohol-associated hepatitis' (SAAH), who have until now been excluded from transplants because the prognosis was so poor. Admitting some people may be unwilling to donate if they know their livers may go to such patients, NHSBT's James Neuberger told the Guardian: 'We transplant humans, not angels.' The pilot project comes amid concern over rising deaths from alcoholic liver diseases – at a time when deaths from other conditions are falling. While alcohol consumption is on a downward trend across most of Europe, it has soared over the past 50 years in the UK. Doctors say liver disease victims are getting younger by the year, but cases of the condition are rising most quickly among the over-60s. At present, people are usually only considered for transplant if they have a more than 50 per cent chance of survival after five years, with a good quality of life. Alcoholics are required to show they will be able to give up drink for the rest of their lives. However, about a fifth of liver transplants involve patients whose condition has been linked to their drinking, including the late footballer George Best. Last night Andrew Langford of the British Liver Trust, said instead of looking at the cause of a potential recipient's disease, 'we should be looking at what their healthcare needs are and not be judgmental'. Most liver disease is caused 'one way or another' by personal choices, he said, adding: 'The vast majority of people who have transplanted organs do look after them and lead a far healthier life.' George Best, who died in November 2005, suffered from a series of internal organ infections after undergoing a liver transplant in July 2002 . There is sometimes not sufficient time to judge the prospects of SAAH patients giving up alcohol and they often suffer infection and bleeding as well as having deep jaundice and mental confusion. The patients doctors intend to treat in the pilot scheme must be between 18 and 40 and must not have seen a doctor about liver disease or been diagnosed with a drink problem before. There has been concern among transplant specialists over the number of candidates they may have to assess – and the impact on other patients awaiting organs. Mr Neuberger said: 'We need to retain public confidence that organs donated are used properly. That trust has to be earned – it can be lost very quickly.' The latest rethink was prompted by a study in November 2011 which reported six-month survival rates of 77 per cent among SAAH patients who received a new liver.","NHS Blood and Transplant Service announced its decision last night .

"Samsung was among the first major techs firm to jump on the smartwatch bandwagon, but its square designs have regularly been criticised for being too clunky. It’s no surprise then that Samsung has filed numerous patents for wrist-worn gadgets with circular faces. The latest, filed in March last year and awarded this week, details what Samsung calls its 'new design' and reveals a round watch with a sensor in the band. The patent was filed by the South Korean tech giant in March last year and awarded this week. It reveals what the firm calls its 'new design’ and shows a circular face. In the files, a selection of images reveal the front, rear, left and right-side (pictured) views . In the files, titled ‘The ornamental design for an electronic device, as shown and described’ images reveal the top front, front, rear, left, and right-side views. In May, a patent detailed a Samsung smartwatch that didn't need a phone to work. Later the same month, images in another patent revealed this rumoured device may not even need a touchscreen. According to the application, the standalone smartwatch could be controlled using gestures, detected by sensors built into the wrist-worn device. These sensors could recognise flicks, waves and other movements, and the files claim a depth sensor, when combined with a camera, for example, could be used to detect what a user is pointing at. It resembles the rounded design of the Moto 360, expected ‘later this summer’ - but was filed before the Moto 360 was officially unveiled. The patent was also filed before Samsung released its square Galaxy Gear and Gear range of watches, so it is unclear if a round watch is in the making, or was only proposed. In a number of the images in the latest patent, a sensor can be seen fitted to the wristband. This could be a camera, similar to the one built into the top panel on the Gear 2, or a heart rate sensor, as seen on the rear of the Galaxy S5 phone. In a number of the images in the latest patent, a sensor can be seen fitted to the wristband (pictured). This could be a camera, similar to the one built into the top panel on the Gear 2, or a heart rate sensor . The Samsung patent images resemble the rounded design of the Moto 360 (pictured), expected ‘later this summer’ - but the patent was filed before the Moto 360 was officially unveiled . The patent doesn't reveal any specifics of the device, but previous patents and products suggest what it may feature. For example, it’s likely any rounded watch will run either Tizen or Android Wear. Samsung's Gear 2, for example, runs on the former, while the Gear Live is powered by the latter. It could also be the first standalone Samsung smartwatch to not need a phone to work. Elsewhere, the watch could be controlled using gestures, detected by sensors built into the wrist-worn device, as seen in a patent published in May.

"These beautiful wedding shots capture the moment a couple tied the knot  - underwater. The stunning wedding was organized by a dive club called Top Dive, which has launched a new concept for wedding tourism in French Polynesia. The bride and groom held hands as they stood in front of a Polynesian priest who performed their eye-watering ceremony. Ceremony: In a picture taken with an underwater camera, a couple holds hands as they sit in front of a Polynesian priest during their underwater wedding ceremony on October 25, 2014 in Bora-Bora, in French Polynesia . Official: The couple stands in front of a Polynesian priest during their unique underwater wedding ceremony . The priest stood at an altar made ​​of pearls to welcome the couple - Nicolas and Alexandra - from Madrid, Spain. The couple decided to seal their union four meters under water in the stunning turquoise waters of Bora Bora. It was the first underwater wedding in this lagoon, but it will certainly not be the last. Paul Ramos, manager of thirteen Top Dive diving clubs in Polynesia said he developed the idea to give couples the experience of a lifetime for just €2,700. Both Alexandra and Nicolas said that they were excited about getting married in such a unique way and donned white wedding diving outfits for their special ceremony. Groom Nicolas said: 'I guess it's like walking for the first time on the moon.' Meanwhile, his bride's outfit was reminiscent of an astronaut's space suit. And unlike most brides, she did not have to worry about having the perfect bridal hairstyle because she had a helmet on her head. Altar: The couple stand at the underwater altar during their unique ceremony that lasted twenty minutes and costs around 2700 euros . Gathered: The couple hold hands underwater as they gather together to say 'I do' with a thumbs up in front of  a priest . The helmets had air pumping through them from the surface of the water. And just like any other wedding on dry land, an underwater photographer was on hand to capture every moment of the couple's big day. The priest conducted the ceremony through headphones, which were also connected to the bride and groom. The chapel was marked by a curtain of bubbles around two armchairs Pomare - the Polynesian royal seats. And at the moment that they had to say 'I do' they did it by putting their thumbs-up. Altogether, the ceremony lasted just 20 minutes. The couple then went on a  bridal canoe and were serenaded by the priest who also knew how to play a ukulele  as he sang a romantic song in Tahitian. By the time that the newlyweds reached dry land,  they sipped champagne flutes on a deserted beach, facing the turquoise lagoon and Mount Otemanu, the iconic peak of Bora Bora.

"It is a problem that affects some five million Britons. But tinnitus – or at least the risk of developing it – could be tackled by drinking three or more coffees a day. The findings, from a study involving nearly 70,000 women, suggest caffeine may have a protective effect against the condition – a constant ringing in the ears that can drive some victims to suicide. Decaffeinated coffee did not have the same benefit. Pain: Tinnitus is a crippling condition - but could be treated by drinking coffee, a controversial study suggests . Researchers in Canada who tracked coffee-drinking habits in middle-aged women found those who drank three to four cups a day were 15 per cent less likely to develop tinnitus and those on more than four cups were 20 per cent less at risk. The results, published in the American Journal of Medicine, are controversial because it was thought that too much caffeine made the ringing worse. But after a 2010 study found tinnitus . sufferers who cut caffeine out of their diets saw no improvement, with . some actually getting worse, scientists decided to look at whether the . world’s most widely-consumed stimulant might be beneficial. Rock chick: There are fears loud music gigs could put young people's hearing at risk . Tinnitus is caused by nerve damage in the inner ear. It can be caused by exposure to loud music, an ear infection or even a cold. The damage results in an abnormal stream of impulses that the brain interprets as constant sound. Many of us suffer temporary tinnitus that lasts no more than a few hours, often from a cold or from going to a loud concert. But for around one in 100 people, it becomes a long-term affliction. Experts . fear growing numbers of younger people are being affected, due to a . gradual rise in noise levels generally and the use of earphones at high . volumes. There is no cure but treatments include counselling and relaxation techniques. This is where patients listen to . background noise, such as gentle music, waves crashing on a shore or . even the hum of traffic, to distract their attention away from the . tinnitus. In 2010 rock fan Robert . McIndoe, from south-east London, stabbed himself to death after he . suffered months of constant ringing in his ears from attending a concert . by the band Them Crooked Vultures. The . married father-of-two, who was 52 when he died, died after repeated unsuccessful attempts to get treatment. Experts at the University of Western Ontario and at Harvard School of Public Health came up with their theory after analysing data from one of the world’s biggest studies into women’s health. Puzzling: Researchers admitted they are baffled by how caffeine might prevent tinnitus, but said it may have something to do with how the stimulant affects delicate hair cells in the inner ear . The Nurses Health Study II detailed the health and lifestyle habits of more than 65,000 nurses in the US. All were aged between 30 and 44 at the beginning of the study. Over 18 years, more than 5,000 went on to develop tinnitus. Researchers admitted they are baffled by how caffeine might prevent tinnitus but said it may have something to do with how the stimulant affects delicate hair cells in the inner ear. They said further research is also needed before doctors can recommend increasing caffeine intake and to confirm that men may benefit in the same way as women. In a report on their findings they said: ‘Higher caffeine intake was associated with a reduced risk of tinnitus. ‘The majority - approximately 70 per cent – of caffeine intake was from coffee consumption but we did not find an association with decaffeinated coffee. ‘This suggests it is caffeine rather than another component of coffee that was associated with a decreased incidence of tinnitus.’","Researchers baffled because the stimulant was thought to make it worse .

The sportscaster made no mention of how newscaster Tara Moore and production manager Dennis McConnell left. Both employees resigned,North Platte Bulletin reported. Mr Swift told viewers: 'If I may take a moment: Tomorrow the last day for two longtime employees at KNOP... I want to take this opportunity to wish the best to Tara and Dennis.' Newscaster Tara Moore resigned from the station . The kind-hearted remarks lost Mr Swift his sportscaster job at the station - where he was worked for two decades. There have been several changes in staffing at KNOP, which has provided news for the area for close to 70 years, since it was bought over a year ago. KNOP now operates under parent company of Gray Television, based in Atlanta, Georgia. Despite his difficult week, Mr Swift remained optimistic, telling North Platte Bulletin: 'I got fired for being a nice guy. I can live with that.' In his career at KNOP, Mr Swift has covered two Super Bowls and numerous Nebraska Cornhusker games, according to his profile on the company's website.

"The fall out from Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster two years ago appears to have found its way into the food chain, as a series of snaps apparently showing 'mutant vegetables' have emerged online. A Korean website has published pictures of flowers, vegetables and fruit covered with deformities and lumps. But it is not immediately clear where the produce was farmed from, whether the images have been doctored and whether the nuclear disaster is in fact to blame. An apparently mutated tomato looks as if it has exploded into mutant form. It has been claimed the fall out from Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster two years ago has found its way into the food chain . These two peaches seem to have doubled. Flowers, vegetables and fruit with deformities and lumps all over it have been photographed and shared on website Igmur . Left, four oranges appear to be joined at the stem, and left a mushroom looks to have been speared by its own stalk. The . Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant meltdown was triggered by an 8.9 . magnitude earthquake in 2011. The disaster - which claimed the lives of . 18,500 people - was the largest nuclear disaster since the Chernobyl . meltdown in 1986. While none of the . deaths have been attributed to radiation exposure from the meltdown, . high levels of radiation have been detected in groundwater near the . plant. Among the 'mutant vegetables'  is a . giant tomato apparently bubbling with tumours, a five-fingered turnip, . and two peaches which have grown into figures of eight. A vegetable grower holds a 'mutant cabbage' as his companion holds aloft a normal sized comparison . While the fruit looks to have mutated it it is not immediately clear where the . produce was farmed from, whether the images have been doctored and . whether the nuclear disaster is in fact to blame . Two gardeners hold cabbages aloft - one a normal size - the other at least four times bigger. And in one picture a cucumber seems to have formed into a strange hybrid with leaves erupting from the base. Earlier this year a fish caught close the the Fukushima . nuclear plant was over 2,500 times the legal safe radiation limit for . seafood, the plant's operator revealed. The company Tokyo Electric Power . (Tepco) caught the fish, dubbed 'Mike the Murasai' online, in the bay . close to the Fukukshima Daiichi main reactor. It was confirmed by Tepco to have . amounts of radioactive cesium equal to 254,000 becquerels per kilogram, . or 2540 times the limit of 100 becquerels/kg set for seafood by the . government. A tomato appears to have green shoots sprouting out of it . Among the 'mutant vegetables'  is a giant tomato apparently bubbling with tumours, a five-fingered turnip . A report in October last year found radiation levels in most kinds of fish caught off the coast of Fukushima haven't declined in the year following Japan's nuclear disaster in March 2011. An earthquake knocked out nuclear plant's cooling system, causing three reactor cores to melt and spew radiation into the ocean. Researchers believe that deposits of the chemical cesium on the seafloor or leakage from the damaged reactors is continuing to contaminate the waters - and has the potential to threaten fisheries for decades. The levels in the fish are also 10 times higher than the radiation measured last August in scorpion fish caught near Fukushima.

"A man shot his neighbour because he believed the 41-year-old had 'telepathically raped' his wife, a court heard. 'Delusional' Michael Selleneit - who has claimed rock guitarist Eddie Van Halen visits him 'in his mind' - is accused of shooting and wounding Tony Pierce as he was working in his garden in Centerville, Utah, U.S. The 54-year-old has said he was acting in self-defence when he shot Mr Pierce, claiming the neighbour had threatened him 'telepathically' and had 'telepathically raped' his wife many times, the court heard. Accused: Michael Selleneit is alleged to have shot his neighbour because he believed the 41-year-old had 'telepathically raped' his wife . Selleneit is charged with attempted murder and illegally possessing a firearm following the incident in October 2011. Defence attorney Julie George said Selleneit - who suffered a brain injury in a car crash as a teenager - has had delusions about being threatened with violence and about his wife being raped since the late 1990s. She said Selleneit believes his neighbour has 'sex parties' with his wife while he is in the next room, and that 'Eddie Van Halen comes into his mind and helps him occasionally'. 'Those are about as bizarre as I think a delusion can get,' said the attorney, who argued that Selleneit should be sent to the Utah State Hospital. 'It's locking him into a belief system that makes it impossible for him to work with me,' she added. Doctors have said Selleneit is 'mentally ill and very likely will be the rest of his life', court documents state. According to previous testimony Selleneit believed Mr Pierce was having sex parties with his wife Melony Toone Selleneit and using crack cocaine to control her mind. The 54-year-old claimed his neighbour telepathically told him: 'We're having a sex party tonight. There will be cocaine. If you don't come, I'll kill you.' Selleneit's wife, also 54, is charged with illegally buying the weapon for her husband, and then urging him to shoot the victim. She has been in the Utah State Hospital, and is scheduled for a six-month review early next month.","Michael Selleneit is accused of shooting and wounding Tony Pierce as he worked in his garden in Utah, U.S.

"Sex offenders in a small Minnesota town are trying to get elected into public office, despite not being allowed to visit city hall as they are ruled a danger to society. The sex offenders are staging a write-in campaign to get elected to city council, and currently make up nearly 20 per cent of voters in Moose Lake, Minnesota. Hundreds of men are civilly committed at the Moose Lake Sex Offender Treatment Program, as a court has ruled them ‘sexually dangerous’ to society after having served a prison sentence. Campaign: Sex offenders at the Moose Lake Sex Offender Treatment Program in Minnesota are staging a write-in campaign to have representatives elected into public office . The sex offenders at the institution in Moose Lake currently make up 18.9 per cent of the registered voters in the town, a number which could increase. At the moment, 925 of Moose Lake’s 2,700 eligible voters are registered, 175 of these at the institution. However, at least 420 convicted rapists, paedophiles and other sex offenders at the treatment facility are eligible to vote, KARE-TV reports. Sex offenders running for office are hoping to elect up to eight representaves in public office in an attempt to ‘improve’ rehabilitation and integration into society for the hundreds of men committed at The Moose Lake Sex Offender Treatment Program (MSOP). The group, all civilly committed indefinitely due to their danger to society, are demanding the right to leave the MSOP without shackles and handcuffs and for Moose Lake to provide halfway houses. Big numbers: At least 420 sex offenders in the programme are eligible to vote in the small town of Moose Lake . Fighting chance: The offenders at the MSOP currently make up 18.9 per cent of the registered voters in Moose Lake, a number which could increase . One of the candidates, Kenny Daywitt, 32, from St Charles, Minnesota, was convicted of sexual assault 13 years ago and civilly committed after completing his prison sentence. ‘I'm definitely a person that has committed a sex offense, and I take full accountability for that. However, that's not the person who I am today,’ He told KARE-TV. ‘The people in town just think we're all monsters out here, and that's not true.’ Another candidate is Charles Stone, convicted 31 years ago for molesting two girls aged eight and nine. Civil confinement sees a sex offender committed to a treatment programme or mental institution after they have served their prison sentence, if a court deems them to be a danger to society. Civil commitment of a sex offender, determined by a court to be 'sexually dangerous' or have 'sexual psychopathic personalities',  is indefinite, and as a result, a de facto life sentence. Minnesota has the most civilly committed sex offenders per capita in the U.S. and only two have been provisionally discharged from the program in the past 20 years. However, he told a local newspaper, he is now 'rehabilitated' and wants increase the ability to take supervised trips outside the MSOP. If the sex offenders are elected to local office, this will not change treatment rules at MSOP as it is run by the state of Minnesota, and not by Moose Lake. As a result of the sex offenders’ campaign, other candidates in Moose Lake are stepping up their game. ‘I don’t think people here appreciate candidates with ulterior motives,’ Doug Juntunen, a Carlton County Sheriff’s deputy who is running for Moose Lake City Council, told Star Tribune. ‘And to me, the sex offenders clearly have an ulterior motive. They just want to be able to walk about [in Moose Lake] and aren’t looking out for the best interests of the city.’ Juntunen hopes that the write-in campaign as MSOP will drive up voters’ participation in Moose Lake, and effectively block the sex offenders’ chances of being elected, something which has happened in the past.","Sex offenders in Moose Lake want a representative at the local city council .

"Suspicions are growing about what role the wife of Justin Ross Harris may have played in the death of their 22-month-old son Cooper in the wake of her husband’s preliminary hearing on Thursday. Leanna Harris has not yet been charged with any crime but a growing number of questions are being asked about her unusual behavior in the wake of young Cooper’s horrific death inside a sweltering SUV last month. Harris, a 30-year-old dietitian, expressed little emotion throughout Thursday’s hearing, despite a number of shocking allegations including that her husband had been sexting with six different women, some teenagers, on the day their young son had passed away. Family: The Atlanta Journal Constitution claims there are discrepancies int he evidence in the case of Justin Ross Harris, pictured right with his wife and late son Cooper . As prosecutors said her husband was practically leading a double life and should not be granted bond, Leanna Harris chewed gum and stared blankly ahead. During Thursday’s proceedings, investigators described her own behavior on the day her son died as odd, if not suspicious. When informed by workers at her son’s day care facility that Cooper had never been dropped off, she calmly responded, ‘Ross must have left him in the car. There’s no other explanation,’ according to Cobb County Police Det. Phil Stoddard’s testimony. Then, when reunited with her husband at police headquarters after he had been charged with murder, Leanna Harris asked him, ‘Did you say too much?’ according to Stoddard. Mom: Police have not named Leanna Harris as a suspect and she has not been charged with any crime . When she called home June 18 with the grim news of Cooper’s death, her mother could be overheard on the phone saying: ‘Why aren’t you crying? Why aren’t you reacting?’ Her response, according to Stoddard: ‘I must be in shock.’ Police had previously disclosed that, like her husband, she had researched children dying in hot vehicles prior to her son Cooper’s death, telling officers it was her ‘worst fear.’ At Cooper’s funeral - and with her husband listening from jail on speaker phone - she said she held no anger toward him. ‘Ross is and was a wonderful father,’ she told mourners, before telling her husband of seven years: ‘I love you and I’m doing this for you.’ No bond: Justin Ross Harris, the Georgia man charged with murder after his toddler son died inside of a hot SUV, was refused bond on July 3 and will now remain in jail until he is tried . Some of Leanna Harris’ comments during her eulogy at Cooper’s funeral have also raised suspicions. ‘Some of you might wonder how I’m standing here today and I ask myself the same question,’ the deeply religious mother said. ‘I should be crumpled into a pile of tears and snot on the ground. (The Lord) is standing behind me, holding me up.' The 250 or so mourners who gathered at University Church of Christ gave her two rounds of applause as she said she wouldn’t bring her son back, even if she could. ‘He’s in the most peaceful, wonderful place there is.’ On Thursday, Cobb County District Attorney Vic Reynolds said the investigation continues and ‘much work remains.’ Many observers believe the police will be looking at Leanna Harris’ possible words and actions very closely. Heartbreaking details: Detective Stoddard testified that there was scratch marks on Cooper Harris' face and abrasions on the back of the toddler's head . Justin Ross Harris is accused of leaving his 22-month-old son Cooper to die in a scorching hot SUV on June 18 . Justin Ross Harris was denied bond on Thursday by a judge who called it a 'possible death penalty case.' He remains in jail on murder and child cruelty charges and prosecutors may seek to use Leanna Harris as a witness. In . Georgia, the spousal privilege shielding a wife from testifying against . her husband, doesn’t apply in cases of the death of a child. ‘She needs to make a deal before the state finds more evidence against her,’ criminal defense lawyer Esther Panitch told AJC.com. Thursday's preliminary hearing also featured disturbing . new details suggesting that 22-month-old Cooper may have tried to free himself before succumbing to the . heat. Detective Stoddard told the court that several injuries were found on the toddler’s body, including visible marks on his face. Aftermath: Guests leave the funeral for Cooper Harris after hearing an emotional call from father Ross from prison as he said goodbye last month . 'It would have come from the child or a scratch being made while the child was alive and then not healing or scabbing over or anything after that, soon after he passed away,' said the officer. There were also abrasions to the back . of Cooper's head suggesting that the toddler was rubbing his head . against the car seat in a desperate bid to get free. The . details that emerged from Stoddard's testimony paint a harrowing . picture of Cooper's final moments, which the little boy possibly spent . scratching his face with his nails and squirming to escape from the car . seat. Arrest warrants . released on Thursday shed additional light on what Cooper Harris must have . been going through inside his father's scorching SUV. According . to the documents, the boy’s car seat was set on the lowest level, which . means that Cooper was strapped in as tightly as possible. Justin . Harris allegedly knew the specific make and model of the car seat and . what the weight limit was for the child to be seated in it, the warrant . revealed. Leanna Harris listened intently to the evidence against her husband being presented by the prosecution and was later escorted to a waiting car after Justin Harris was denied bond . New documents released on Friday showed that Justin Harris had given his family grim instruction on what . they'd have to do to collect on an insurance policy on the boy's life . from his cell. 'Through the . investigation Harris has made comments to family members regarding a . life insurance policy that he has on Cooper and what they need to do in . order to file for it,' the paper reported. A Cobb County detective said there were two life insurance policies on the boy's life: one for $25,000 and one for $2,000. It's uncertain whether the family has actually attempted to claim the money. Stoddard described the evidence police . have suggesting Harris, who is charged with murder, killed his . 22-month-old son Cooper intentionally. Leanna Harris also told police the pair were having intimacy issues, according to . Stoddard. There are texts to indicate that she knew he was cheating on . her. 'We plan to show that he wanted to live a child-free life,' the prosecution told the judge. Stoddard . testified that before the boy died, Harris had visited the website . Reddit to search for articles on life without children, and viewed . videos on Reddit that showed people dying - by suicide or execution, in . some cases. Accused: Justin Ross Harris is facing additional charges of sexual exploitation of a minor as well as murder and child cruelty . Harris had also twice viewed a video that shows the painful death of animals left in hot cars, and had searched for 'how to survive in prison', according to searches of his laptop, Stoddard said. ‘I think the evidence now is . showing intent,’ Stoddard said. He said Harris should remain in jail . because he is a flight risk: There is evidence he was leading a double . life, he has family in Alabama, and the former 911 dispatcher has law . enforcement experience. Defense attorney Maddox Kilgore said that evidence had no bearing on Harris' intent. 'I think the real purpose of all that is to publicly shame him,' Kilgore said . Harris is a native of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and moved to Georgia in 2012 to work for Home Depot. He sat impassively in an orange jail jumpsuit during Thursday's hearing. Harris described Cooper as peaceful with his eyes closed, when this wasn't the case, according to Stoddard. He allegedly also told his wife: 'I dreaded how he would look' Cobb County Police Detective Phil Stoddard testified at a hearing that evidence showed Justin Ross Harris was practically leading a double life and should not be granted bond .","Justin Ross Harris is accused of leaving his 22-month-old son Cooper to die in a scorching hot SUV on June 18 .

"Pedialyte, an electrolyte packed drink for dehydrated babies, may also be a cure for hungover adults. Regardless of whether or not the drink is an effective cure, Chicago college and graduate students swear by the drink and have begun demanding it at their local stores, The Daily News reported. Pedialyte is so popular in Chicago that a delivery app called Foxtrot may add Pedialyte to their menu after receiving numerous requests. This poor hungover girl may need to grab a bottle of pedialyte . Pediatricians #1 electrolyte formula is Chicago student's #1 hangover cure . Pedialyte sales have remained static over the years but recently sales have skyrocketed. Whether or not the drinks popularity is parallel with its use as a hangover remedy is unclear. It sure seems that way, though. Grid Chicago reported that, figures from market research firm IRI show that Pedialyte sales surged 16% in August compared to the same month in 2012. Some adults compare Pedialyte to Gatororade but without all the added sugar. Musician Jason Isbell toll The New York Times Magazine, 'It's like 10 Gatorades in a bottle.' Chicago students wanting to recover from partying are starting to demand that their local bodega carry Pedialyte . Whether or not Pedialyte actually works as a hangover cure is still up for debate. A group of Chinese researchers at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou say that sprite is actually the best hangover cure. Doctors don't see eye to eye with Chicago students. The Daily News reports that Stanley Goldfarb, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, told Slate that Pedialyte wont work to stop a hangover. 'There's nothing you can do to remove the alcohol byproducts,' DR.Perelman said. 'They have to be metabolized by your liver, which takes time. There's no evidence that anything is better than waiting,'he continued. The drink's website section listed 'Pedialyte to the rescue' says the drink is Pediatricians #1 oral electrolyte solution.

"A car-obsessed dentist who has amassed Britain’s biggest private car collection is selling the whole lot for £100million. James Hull, 53, who founded the James Hull Associates chain of dentists, owns more than 450 rare and classic cars, ranging from multi-million pound rare Jaguars to Winston Churchill's Austin, and a Bentley once owned by Elton John. With no room to park them all near his home in Kensington, west London, he garages them in vast warehouses in Herefordshire, but has now decided to sell up because of health reasons. Britain's largest private car collection, built up by cosmetic dentistry millionaire James Hull, 53, pictured, is for sale as a whole for £100million . All yours... if you've got deep pockets: Dr Hull's 457-strong car collection is currently kept in warehouses in Herefordshire . Dr Hull's collection includes this classic Triumph TR5, left, built in Coventry in the late 1960s, and this classic racing car, right, driven in this picture by Stirling Moss . Planes (no trains) and automobiles: Dr Hull has collected Bentleys, Rolls Royces and Jaguars, as well as some aircraft from the First and Second World Wars . None of the cars is cheap, but a buyer with particularly deep pockets is needed, because Dr Hull says he is determined to sell the 457-strong collection as a whole. He is hoping a buyer will come in with a £100million-plus offer, making it the highest value car sale in Britain. For that price, the buyer will get 457 classic vehicles, 365 pedal cars and 300 pieces of memorabilia including model aircraft from WW1 and WW2. With cars represented from every decade since the 1930s, the collection includes a Jaguar D-Type, worth in excess of £4million, a similarly valuable Jaguar C-Type, and Lord Mountbatten's Mini Traveller, as well as a super-rare 1950s Jaguar KXSS. The . collection also includes a Humber which was owned by the judge presiding . over the Profumo Affair and a 1961 Jaguar E-Type which belonged to . Britain’s world motorcycle champion Mike Hailwood. Dr Hull, who made his fortune pioneering cosmetic dentistry in the UK, has battled cancer three times in the past four years, earning him the nickname Lazarus to friends.  He travelled around the world to track down some of the rarer models in his collection, shipping them back to Britain and then having them stripped down before rebuilding them. This classic Bentley is among Dr Hull's collection - he travelled the world finding rare cars before shipping them back to Britain and having them restored . As well as full-size motors, the collection includes more than 300 miniature pedal cars, pictured at the back, as well as a Sinclair C5 from the 1980s . This bottle green Morris Minor forms part of the collection, which boasts cars from every decade since the 1930s and is said to be worth at least £100million . He said: 'It's the culmination of a life-long hobby.  Each car has its own story and all have played a part in the history of British motoring.  It's part of our heritage. 'I'm merely a passionate custodian of this hugely significant part of British history and, with luck, I will succeed in finding a home that can not only be enjoyed and treasured by the British public but also be admired by visitors from across the world.' A number of Dr Hull's cars have appeared at motor shows around the world, competed in the Mille Miglia Italian road-race, and even been used for the Queen’s 80th birthday parade. There are also dozens of cars which have won concours awards, and a collection of British campervans from . the 1940s, 50s and 60s, as well as early Land Rovers, classic Range Rovers,and a Sinclair C5 from the 1980s. The collection, which is being sold privately, has already had a 'huge amount of interest' from private buyers and consortia, from overseas as well as nearer to home, but Dr Hull hopes it will remain in Britain. Graham Searle, from the Jaguar Enthusiasts’ Club, said: 'Dr Hull is a well known Jaguar Enthusiasts’ Club member with an immense passion for Jaguar cars. Mint condition: This shining red Mini Traveller was once owned by Lord Mountbatten, and is now for sale as part of a job lot going for at least £100milion . Dr Hull made his fortune by pioneering cosmetic dentistry in Britain with his James Hull Associates chain - he then spent it on these classic motor cars . Stamp-collecting next? Once he has sold his cars, including this classic Jaguar XK, Dr Hull says he will need a new hobby, but he hasn't picked one yet . 'Most of his cars are very original or restored to original specification with great attention to detail, and over the years he must have won more concours awards than any other Jaguar collector. 'He does immense service to the classic car movement in keeping these cars in top condition, and the sale of the collection will attract enormous interest from around the world. 'We of course hope that whoever buys them allows them to be seen and enjoyed by enthusiasts for years to come.' James Hull made his money after founding James Hull Associates in 1987, becoming the market leader in cosmetic dentistry, specialising in teeth whitening, veneers and implants. He was devastated in 2006 when vandals broke into one of his warehouses, before hotwiring the Jaguars and crashing dozens of them. Police later said they had 'treated the cars like dodgems'. Over the past decade, prices for classic cars have shot up, outperforming every other investment and sending the value of the collection soaring. If he finds a suitable buyer, Dr Hull will need a new hobby, but he's not yet sure what it will be. He said: 'I’m a collector, so who knows what will turn up next.  My wife hopes it will be something smaller like stamps.'","James Hull has built up collection of unusual and valuable cars, from Elton John's old Bentley to rare Jaguar KXSS .

"The crew of the USS Dewey have honored the dying wish of a Pearl Harbor survivor by allowing him on board the latest version of the destroyer he served on in the Second World War. Electrician’s Mate Second Bud Cloud was due to begin hospice care, when his friend Jennie Haskamp reached out to the Dewey's crew and asked if he could see the ship in San Diego. But when they arrived at the dock, the sailors carried the 90-year-old veteran on board and attentively listened as he shared his memories from the war. Hero's welcome: EM2 Bud Cloud is saluted by the crew of USS Dewey as he visits the warship . Emotional: Bud Cloud had his dying wish fulfilled when he was able to board the Dewey again . It was an emotional day for Cloud. who died 13 days after going on board. For 12 of those days he spoke non-stop about the visit, according to I Drive Warships. Even the journey to the San Diego base moved Cloud to tears as Ms Haskamp, and her friend Mandy McCammon, pulled up next to the ship earlier this year. 'He’d been oohing and pointing at the . cyclic rate as we approached the pier, but when we slowed down and Mandy . said, ""They’re all here for you, Bud,"" he was overwhelmed,' she said. The day before their visit he had constantly asked if they were 'still going down to visit the boys from the Dewey,' and 'do they know I was on the Dewey, too?' Ms Haskamp, who says she was adopted by Cloud after her first tour in the Marine Corps, had thought they would be viewing the ship from the pier - but the crew had other ideas. When Petty Officer Simon introduced himself to Cloud, he explained that he had been given the honor of pushing the veteran's wheelchair for the day, and that they intended to bring him on board. Once on deck, the Commanding Officer Commander Jake Douglas, and several of the crew were there to introduce themselves to Cloud. On deck: The crew of USS Dewey with Bud Cloud and Jennie Haskamp . They shook his hand, posed for photos and listened to stories from Cloud, who was 18 when the Japanese launched their attack on Pearl Harbor. Cloud, who had only days left to live, could speak in only a whisper but two crew members relayed his stories to the rest of the group. During one story, Cloud was stopped mid-sentence as one of the crew members brought a large photo of the original USS Dewey over to show him. 'That moment was priceless,' Ms Haskamp said. 'Bud stopped . mid-sentence and yelled, ""There she is!"" ' She said the crew continued to hold the photo up as Cloud told them about the ship's armament and details of the attack in Pearl Harbor. The Dewey that Cloud had served on was sold in 1946. The current Dewey, the third to hold the name, was launched in 2009. After more than an hour sharing tales of his military past, Cloud was starting to feel tired. As the crew said their good-byes GMC Eisman asked if a few of them could visit him in the hospice in a few months. Ms Haskamp then had to explain that Cloud had less than a month to live. WIthout pausing for thought, the crew asked if they could provide the burial honors when his time came, and then piped him ashore. Formidable: The USS Dewey that EM2 Cloud served on during the Second World War . As he neared the gangplank they announced over the ship's speakers: 'Electrician's Mate Second Class William Bud Cloud, Pearl Harbor Survivor, departing.' Cloud died 13 days after the visit. For 12 of those days he talked non stop about his time on board and of the sailors he had met. The crew kept their word and provided burial honors for Cloud, then spent time with his family at the reception.","EM2 Bud Cloud had served on USS Dewey during Second World War .

"Free to go: Abid Hussain leaving Manchester Crown Court where the Muslim preacher who tried to strangle his 16-year old daughter avoided jail . A Muslim preacher who tried to strangle his 16-year old daughter after she refused to enter into an arranged marriage with her cousin has avoided jail. Abid Hussain, 56, grabbed the neck of Rabiyah Abid and said: 'If you don't follow my rules I will kill you' after she rejected his plans for her to wed. Hussain also left the teenager in fear of her life as he battered her about the head at the family home above the mosque he runs at Longsight, Manchester. The father-of-five had snapped after discovering Rabiyah refused to follow strict Islamic tradition and embarked on a romance with a student she had met on Facebook. She had previously run away from home to be with him and even helped police draw up a court order banning her father from forcing her into the marriage. At Manchester Crown Court yesterday Hussain was convicted of assault and making threats to kill. He admitted his daughter's conduct had 'brought shame' on his family and caused him 'mental torture' but denied wrongdoing. His two sons Nawab Uddin, 23, and Bahaud Uddin, 21 were also convicted of assaulting the teen. Henry Blackshaw, prosecuting said Rabiyah lived in a 'very male dominated, patriarchal household' where she was left 'exhausted' by cooking and cleaning. In accordance with Islamic tradition she had been 'betrothed' by her father to his sister's son in Pakistan at just 15 years old. But she ended up falling for college student Gulraiz Sultan whom she had met on social media. In November last year, while her father was celebrating Eid in Pakistan, Mr Sultan travelled from his home in London to Oldham to stay with a friend and Rabiyah fled her home to stay with him. Nawab reported the teenager missing to police but when officers traced her, she told them of her fears that she would be forced to marry when she had finished her GCSEs at school. When her father returned from Pakistan, he learned that she had stayed with her secret boyfriend, and to add 'insult to injury' he was served by police with a Forced Marriage Prevention Order stopping him from pressuring her into the arranged marriage. When Hussain saw the document - which . led to the girl's passport being taken by the authorities - he regarded . it as a 'combination of her and the UK judicial system depriving him of . his right to choose her husband within his own family'. Write caption here . Weeks later, on December 26, last year he assaulted her leading her to send a text message to Sultan saying 'I thought I was going to die last night'. Two days later her brothers, Nawab and Bahaud were said to have snatched her phone from her - to stop the teenager texting Sultan and smacked her in the face and head. She wore a veil to hide her injuries and the next day she reported them to police. Describing the attack by her father, Rabiyah said: 'He used his right hand to grab my neck. It was quite painful. He said ""If you don't follow my rules I will kill you."" He was quite angry, really angry.' Mr Blackshaw said: 'Hussain is plainly a devout man retaining traditional values regarding family matters, which is the reason for what we say was the offending in this case, because his daughter was not going along with his wishes in following that cultural duty.' In his defence Hussain claimed his daughter was free to wed whom she wanted and accused of her and her boyfriend of making false accusations. He said: 'I told her, if you want to go with him you are at liberty but adopt a proper way, a civilised way, a modern way. We can't force you. But I got told by someone that they made a plan that father should go to jail.' He told the jury his daughter's . behaviour had brought shame on the family and caused them 'mental . torture' but denied that anger had led him to attack her. Conviction: Father-of-five Abid Hussain and his two sons were all convicted of assault at Manchester Crown Court, Crown Square . Bahaud Uddin said he would have preferred for his sister to marry their cousin, since 'blood matching blood' was better. Sentencing Hussain Judge Michael Leeming said: 'You're a man of high standing in the local Asian community and take your family, culture and religion very seriously. 'Its clear that these offences were committed in the context of your strict religious and cultural beliefs. 'At home Rabia had in your view departed from what was expected of her. 'But of course she was 16 and entitled to make her own decisions and mistakes. 'And if it comes about that she has made a mistake then she will know it is of her own making. 'I am satisfied this was a strange loss of temper but an attempt to part your own influence and control on your daughter an attempt to coerce her in to conforming with your own beliefs.' Sentencing Nawab Uddin the judge said: 'As with your father you stand to deny your responsibility for what the jury have found you guilty of. 'You told the probation officer you regard your sisters behaviour as shameful, that she had brought shame to your family and that she had been effectively manipulated and deceived.' Sentencing Bahaud Uddin, The judge said: 'You deny these allegations and regard yourself as being wrongly convicted. 'There's concerns about your rigid thinking and the fact you seem to have no victim awareness or empathy. 'And your described your sisters complaints as being malicious and you regard her as having changed by her boyfriend.' Abid Hussain received a suspended sentence of nine months suspended for 12 months, with 100 hours unpaid work. Nawab Uddin received a suspended sentence of three months suspended for 12 months, with 100 hours unpaid work and a supervision order for 12 months. Bahaud Uddin received three months suspended for 12 months, with 200 hours unpaid work.","Abid Hussain grabbed his daughter around the neck after she rejected wedding plans .

Meanwhile yesterday forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad killed at least 15 Palestinians, mostly women and children, in a rocket attack on a rebel-held refugee camp on the southern edge of Damascus, opposition activists said. Palestinian militia from the pro-Assad Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC) as well as Syrian army and intelligence troops have been surrounding the camp for months. On Saturday they launched a ground infantry assault backed by tanks and multiple rocket launchers to capture the camp but were being met by stiff resistance, opposition sources said.

"Former archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams has spoken of his fears for the global climate . Former archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams has spoken of his fears for the global climate, saying the winter flooding was a portent of what is to come in the future. He has blamed the lifestyle of Western countries for climate change, which he said is 'pushing the environment towards crisis'. He said the floods in Britain and similar weather-related catastrophes around the world are the clearest indications yet that predictions of 'accelerated warming of the Earth' caused by the uncontrolled burning of fossil fuels... 'are coming true'. His comments come as the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) prepares to release a major report that is expected to warn of catastrophic consequences to food supplies, livelihoods, health and security across the world if climate change is allowed to continue unchecked. Leaked versions of the report, published in Japan tomorrow, warn that rising global temperatures, droughts and heat waves will threaten food supplies and human health, while hundreds of millions of people will be affected by coastal flooding. Climate change will cause economic losses, exacerbate poverty and increase migration and risks from violent conflict as well as causing damage to wildlife and habitats, the study by experts from around the world is expected to warn. In Europe, heatwaves, droughts and heavy rainstorms will increase and there will be a greater risk of coastal and river flooding, it is expected to say, while heat-related deaths will also increase. The report, which collates work by thousands of scientists from across the planet, is likely to state that global warming has already left its mark on all continents and oceans, and is expected to warn that even a small increase in temperatures could lead to irreversible changes. Residents struggling to move in the flood water in Shepperton, Surrey, during the floods in February . Energy Secretary Ed Davey has also declared that Britain must spearhead the worldwide battle against global warming. Climate change is 'hugely threatening' to life both in the UK and globally, Mr Davey told The Observer, saying that not to lead the fight against it would be 'deeply irresponsible'. Mr Davey, whose portfolio also involves responsibility for climate change, said more people should be worried about the issue than ever. Energy Secretary Ed Davey has also declared that Britain must spearhead the worldwide battle against global warming . The Lib Dem MP said: 'Climate change is impacting our way of life in the UK... The impacts on our people could be huge. We could see problems of real devastation from flooding and other severe weather events hitting food and water availability - really significant things.' He added: 'Climate change is hugely threatening to our way of life, in the UK, Europe and the world. Not to lead is deeply irresponsible. If you don't lead, you will not bring others with you.' Britain has made recent decisions that put the environmental agenda low on its list of priorities, scrapping green levies from energy bills and defeating efforts in Europe to set renewable energy targets for 2030 for each nation, the newspaper said. But Mr Davey was adamant that climate change sceptics in the Government had been defeated, saying: 'Those of us who care about climate change and believe it is something we need to lead on have won the argument internally. People don't realise that we got a deal across the coalition that puts Britain right at the head, the most ambitious country.' He added that Britain had agreed to slash emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 as part of a global deal.Dr Williams, who stepped down as leader of the Anglican Church just over a year ago, said tomorrow's report puts 'our local problems into a deeply disturbing global context'. Writing in his capacity as chairman of Christian Aid, he said: 'We have heard for years the predictions that the uncontrolled burning of fossil fuels will lead to an accelerated warming of the Earth. 'What is now happening indicates that these predictions are coming true; our actions have had consequences that are deeply threatening for many of the poorest communities in the world. 'Rich, industrialised countries, including our own, have unquestionably contributed most to atmospheric pollution. Both our present lifestyle and the industrial history of how we created such possibilities for ourselves have to bear the responsibility for pushing the environment in which we live towards crisis.' Sign of what is to come: An aerial view of the River Thames after it burst its banks following bad weather in Weybridge . Campaigners yesterday warned that the world faces a 'bleak future' without action to tackle climate change and leading environmentalists called on politicians to break the world's dependency on fossil fuels. Friends of the Earth's executive director Andy Atkins said: 'We face a bleak future if the world continues to ignore the grim scientific warnings of our failure to tackle global warming. 'Droughts, floods and famines are just some of the devastating effects that people around the world are already suffering from more frequent extreme weather - and, unless we take urgent measure, it will get far worse.' A man tries to protect his home in Staines, Middlesex, after the River Thames caused flooding earlier this year . Sally Uren, chief executive of Forum for the Future, which advises businesses and governments on sustainability, said: 'The IPCC report should be read as a vital wake-up call. 'It is now more clear than ever that the risk to society from climate change is real and that large-scale action is needed now, by all of us, to both cut our carbon emissions, and also to accelerate the pace at which we adapt to a rapidly changing climate.'

"A heroic Vietnamese helicopter pilot saved his family - and cheated death - by hurling his wife children onto a fleeing U.S. warship during the Fall of Saigon, then leaping into the sea as the aircraft plunged into the waters behind him. New footage has emerged showing his daring escape as the U.S.military withdrew from Vietnam in the face of advancing communist forces. The pilot was one of several Vietnamese helicopter pilots who piled in during the United States' evacuation of all its personnel in Vietnam in April 1970. Hovering: The pilot, seen above in the leftmost window, tailed U.S. choppers to make it to the USS Kirk, where he threw his family to safety because his Chinook was too large to land on the deck . Explosion: The helicopter blew up dramatically as the pilot banked it into the sea as he leaped out after jettisoning his family . Catch! Servicemen below were able to grab his falling children - the youngest of whom, above, was just eight months old . Their story - and new photographs and footage of their dramatic escape - have been unearthed and turned into a forthcoming documentary for ABC. While U.S. servicemen flew Americans, and hundreds of Vietnamese, between the embassy in Saigon and ships waiting off the coast of Vietnam, some South Vietnamese took matters into their own hands. Armed only with their scarcely-fueled small helicopters, many pilots tailed the U.S. helicopters back to the waiting USS Kirk, and were allowed to land on board with their families and cram onto the ship. Desperate mission: After saving his family the pilot made his own escape, bringing his helicopter just above the water . Escape! The pilot, seen right in the water, was able to swim to safety while the helicopter sank to the bottom . Joining in with the huge evacuation - dubbed Operation Frequent Wind - was their only hope of escaping torture and death at the hands of North Vietnam. In now-iconic images, the useless choppers were then pushed overboard to make room for more evacuees. But the new footage, compiled by director Rory Kennedy, also features one even more dramatic story. Target: Vietnamese choppers followed the Americans to boats waiting offshore - seen above as a white trail in the sea - which allowed them to land on deck . Refugees: Ships such as the USS Kirk were heaving with Vietnamese escaping the encroaching communist armies . One Vietnamese pilot followed like his comrades - but he was flying a much larger Chinook aircraft which couldn't land on the Kirk. So instead he hovered an estimated 18ft above the deck, and hurled his children - aged two, five and eight months - out of the plane into the arms of U.S. servicemen, followed by his wife. Then - trapped in his helicopter and fast running out of fuel - he pulled of his pilot suit, hovered as close to the water as he could, and prepared to leap out. Abandoned: Soldiers dumped landed helicopters in the water to make room for more people on board . Evacuation: Thousands of people were carried out of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon, above, by helicopters. It remains the largest ever helicopter evacuation . The pilot tilted the right-hand side of the helicopter into the sea, while leaping out of the left hand side. The chopper exploded when it hit the sea, but after less than a minute the pilot's head emerged from the water not far from the sinking wreckage and he was taken on board the USS Kirk. Operation Frequent Wind - which began using fixed-wing aircraft until all the U.S. runways were shelled and unusable - evacuated more than 50,000 from South Vietnam. The helicopter portion remains largest evacuation by helicopter in history. Most Vietnamese who escaped during the Fall of Saigon were allowed to move to the United States. Desperate: Pictured above are dozens of Vietnamese piling on to a small helicopter on a building not far from the U.S. Embassy as part of Operation Frequent Wind .","Daring escape story from the 1975 Fall of Saigon has been uncovered .

"The man with the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the U.S. went to hospital feeling sick only to be given antibiotics and be sent home. It was not until two days later that the man was admitted to the Dallas hospital and put in isolation, it has been reported. It raises the frightening prospect that he was mixing freely with other people for a full two days while showing symptoms of the virus - the time when Ebola is most contagious. The unidentified patient has been in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital since Sunday, officials said. The hospital has launched a review into the delay. Scott Gordon, a reporter for KXAS, tweeted 'Hospital reviewing why patient wasn't properly diagnosed on Friday when he was evaluated and sent home. Dismissed with antibiotics.' Scroll down for video . Patient: A man with the Ebola virus was given antibiotics before he returned to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital (pictured)  and was confirmed to have Ebola . Virus: The Ebola virus epidemic has killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa . '#Dallas patient diagnosed with #Ebola was initially dismissed with prescription for antibiotics,' CBS DFW tweeted. Officials have not disclosed his nationality but a statement from the city of Dallas said he was visiting relatives in the US after travelling from Liberia. Dr. Edward Goodman, epidemiologist for Texas Health Presbyterian, said the hospital had a plan for handling Ebola should a suspected case emerge and was 'well prepared' to provide care. After arriving in the U.S. on Sept. 20, the patient began to develop symptoms on Sept. 24 and initially sought care two days later, Frieden said. The patient was admitted to the hospital on Sept. 28, when Texas Health Presbyterian put him under strict isolation. Blood tests by Texas health officials and the CDC separately confirmed an Ebola diagnosis on Tuesday. Asked how many people the patient may have had close contact with in that time period, Frieden said, 'I think a handful is the right characterization.' Goodman added: 'It does not appear the man went to any other hospitals in the area'. Health authorities have begun tracking down family and friends who may have had close contact with the patient and could be at risk for becoming ill. But officials said there are no other suspected cases in Texas that they are aware of. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings told CBS DFW 'We have  quarantined both [the ambulance crew that took the patient to the hospital] and the unit itself to make sure that nothing was there that can be spread.' He added: 'First and foremost, we gotta have our thoughts and prayers for this man, who is very sick and hopefully he'll get well. But we're gonna sure everybody else is safe at the same time.' At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta, Dr. Tom Frieden said the patient left Liberia on Sept. 19, arrived the next day to visit family and started feeling ill four or five days later. He said it was not clear how the person became infected. Frieden said there was no risk to anyone on the airplane because the patient had no symptoms at the time of the flight. Prevention: The Ebola virus  is not contagious until symptoms begin, and it takes close contact with bodily fluids to spread . Ebola symptoms can include fever, muscle pain, vomiting and bleeding, and it can take as long as 21 days after exposure to the virus for them to appear. The disease is not contagious until symptoms begin, and it takes close contact with bodily fluids to spread. 'The bottom line here is that I have no doubt we will control this importation, or this case of Ebola, so that it does not spread widely in this country,' Frieden told a news conference. 'It is certainly possible that someone who had contact with this individual, a family member or other individual, could develop Ebola in the coming weeks,' he added. 'But there is no doubt in my mind that we will stop it here.' Frieden updated President Barack Obama on the patient and the public health investigation, the White House said. Frieden said he believed the case also marked the first time this particular strain of Ebola has been diagnosed outside of West Africa. The dramatic development comes after four American aid workers who became infected while volunteering in West Africa were flown back to the U.S. for treatment after they became sick. They were cared for in special isolation facilities at hospitals in Atlanta and Nebraska. Also, a U.S. doctor exposed to the virus in Sierra Leone is under observation in a similar facility at the National Institutes of Health. Liberia is one of the three hardest-hit countries in the epidemic, along with Sierra Leone and Guinea (file photo) The U.S. has only four such isolation units. But asked whether the patient would be moved to one of those specialty facilities, Frieden said there was no need and virtually any hospital could provide the proper care and infection control. Since the summer months, U.S. health officials have been preparing for the possibility that an individual traveler could unknowingly arrive with the infection. Health authorities have advised hospitals on how to prevent the virus from spreading within their facilities. People boarding planes in the outbreak zone are checked for fever, but that does not guarantee that an infected person won't get through. Liberia is one of the three hardest-hit countries in the epidemic, along with Sierra Leone and Guinea. The epidemic has killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa.","A Dallas hospital initially mistook a man's case of the Ebola virus in a Texas hospital for something else and gave him antibiotics .

"President Barack Obama has skipped his in-person daily intelligence briefing on four out of every seven days of his presidency, according to a shocking report released Tuesday. The Government Accountability Institute, previously best-known for needling members of Congress over insider-trading deals that lax laws have rendered legal, used the official White House calendar to compile a list of the days when Obama wasn't scheduled to receive a briefing. The resulting numbers showed that he only attended the Presidential Daily Brief 42.1 per cent of the time. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Obama received daily briefings in person only 3 out of every 7 days; this photo shows his November 14, 2012 brief with then-National Security Advisor Tom Donilon, then-Chief of Staff Jack Lew, and then-Deputy National Security Advisor Denis McDonough . Vacuum: Obama reads his briefings alone most of the time, without the benefit of Q&A with his advisers . ABC News reported in 2012 that the president often prefers to receive his daily briefing in writing, and reads it on his iPad. An Obama administration national security aide confirmed this to  MailOnline on Monday. 'It's pretty well-known that the president hasn’t taken in-person intelligence briefings with any regularity since the early days of 2009,' the aide said. 'He gets them in writing.' The resulting picture is one of a solitary chief executive consuming his intelligence briefs in a vacuum instead of engaging in two-way conversations with generals and spymasters. U.S. presidents have handled daily intelligence briefings in a variety of ways, according to the CIA's history of the Presidential Daily Briefing. George W. Bush expected oral CIA briefings six days per week and hardly ever missed them, but that often allowed officials to steer the president toward operations that the agency preferred. Ronald Reagan often got his briefings in writing but largely met only with his National Security Adviser; the National Security Agency was miffed that its reps were seldom invited into the Oval Office. Jimmy Carter was known for taking notes on his briefing pages as he met with his National Security Adviser, who would returned them to the CIA for analysis and answers.While Richard Nixon was president, his briefings were couriered each morning to National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger. The president was casual about digesting it, but referred to it throughout the day. When Gerald Ford became president following Nixon's resignation, he insisted on an oral briefing from the CIA as his first meeting every morning so he could keep up with Kissinger, who had become Secretary of State. The personal disconnect between the Oval Office and the intelligence community has been a sore spot for the military, the CIA and the National Security Agency since early in the Obama presidency. Those tensions came to a head on Sunday, when the president blamed Director of National Intelligence James Clapper for failing to foresee the ISIS terror army's rise to power. Clapper 'has acknowledged that, I think, they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria,' he said during a '60 Minutes' interview. Responses from the intel community were both fast and furious. 'Either the president doesn’t read the intelligence he’s getting or he’s bulls***ting,' a former senior Pentagon official told the Daily Beast. The national security aide who spoke to MailOnline said that 'unless someone very senior has been shredding the president's daily briefings and telling him that the dog ate them, highly accurate predictions about ISIL (also called ISIS) have been showing up in the Oval Office since before the 2012 election.' 'We were seeing specific threat assessments' from the intelligence community,' the staffer said, 'and many of them have panned out exactly as we were told they would.'

After the deadly 2012 terror attack on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, Breitbart.com found that Obama had not attended an in-person daily briefing on the five days preceding the highly organized assault by an al-Qaeda-linked militia group. American Crossroads, a conservative political group, leapt into the fray with an ad lambasting the president for skipping his briefings while maintaining a steady presence on golf courses. 'Mr President: It's time to show up for work,' blared the biting video.","Report from the Government Accountability Institute examined the president's public calendar every day since his first inauguration .

"When the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a law Wednesday morning that limits Americans' contributions to political candidates, liberals in Washington hyperventilated. Within minutes, far-left Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York fired off a terse press release slapping the five justices, all appointees of Republican presidents, who joined in a majority to open the floodgates to more money in politics. 'This in itself is a small step, but another step on the road to ruination,' said Schumer. 'It could lead to interpretations of the law that would result in the end of any fairness in the political system as we know it.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Democrats in the US Senate practically hyperventilated Wednesday after the Supreme Court struck down campaign donation limits . A relative handful of protesters angry about corporate money in politics held court as the decision came down . Bernie Sanders, a Democratic senator from Vermont who describes himself as a socialist, tweeted his disgust. 'To equate the ability of billionaires to buy elections with ""freedom of speech"" is totally absurd,' he wrote.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, took on the Supreme Court directly. 'The court is utterly ignorant about elections. Not one of them has ever stood for office,' Whitehouse said during a press conference. 'They have the enthusiasm of amateurs and think they know what they're talking about and in fact they're just dead wrong.' The conservative judges' decision, he lamented, was rooted in a 'lack of humility.' In a crowded field of congressional reactions, it's common for the most outrageous sound bites to be heard most clearly. But Democrats – and one leftward tilting Republican – see the decision in 'McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission' as a sequel to the controversial 'Citizens United' case, and it genuinely seemed to upset them. Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain predicted in a statement 'that as a result of recent Court decisions, there will be scandals involving corrupt public officials and unlimited, anonymous campaign contributions that will force the system to be reformed once again.' Sen. Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, warned that the Supreme Court ruling 'could lead to interpretations of the law that would result in the end of any fairness in the political system as we know it' His namesake 2002 Mccain-Feingold law reformed the use of 'soft money' in U.S. politics, a subject on which he has continued to be heard in the twelve years since its passage. Both the latest decision and 'Citizens United' overturned long-held limits on money in elections. Democratic politicians have finely honed the art of loudly objecting to the presence of seven- and eight-figure purses weighing in every two years, especially demonizing David and Charles Koch, a brotherly duo of libertarian big spenders. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been this spring's most prolific Koch-basher, mentioning them by name five times in a four minute speech on Tuesday about House Republicans' budget proposal – a document that he claims was written to appease the larger-than-life political donors. 'It's a blueprint for a modern ... how would we say this? Koch-topia. Yes, that's it,' Reid said on the Senate floor. 'Call it whatever you want. We might as well call it the Koch budget because that's what they're doing, protecting the Koch brothers.' True to form, Reid targeted the duo after the Supreme Court handed down its decision. The ruling, he told reporters, 'take[s] away people's rights; because, as you know, the Koch brothers are trying to buy America.' Democrats, too, have their billionaire sugar daddies. George Soros has poured hundreds of millions into issue advocacy groups and directly into campaign coffers. And Tom Steyer has put up nearly $100 million this year in order to push climate change as part of Democratic campaign platforms. The McCutcheon case will please fundraisers on both sides, just in time for November's midterm congressional elections. Chief Justice John Roberts (front C) delivered the opinion for a majority of five jurists, all of whom were appointed by Republicans . Maverick: Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain bucked the trend and joined with Democrats who were angry at the nation's top jurists . The Supreme Court left in place the legal limits on how much an individual can donate to any single candidate. But the aggregate limits have been eliminated. Before Wednesday morning, a single donor could contribute a maximum of $123,200 to candidates in each two-year election cycle, including no more than $48,600 directly to candidates and another $74,600 to political action committees and the political parties themselves. Democrats – including President Barack Obama's solicitor general Donald Verilli, who argued the case – worry about a scenario where money could be moved between campaign funds if someone 'maxed out' all his or her potential giving. In all, $3.6 million can now be donated every two years. that includes the maximum allowed for every House and Senate races, for Democratic or Republican Parties in all 50 states, and for the national parties. Theoretically, either party could conspire to more much of that money into a single high-stakes campaign, effectively busting the new ceiling for a wealthy giver. Barely a week ago the Supreme Court was thrust into the national spotlight, hearing oral arguments in an emotional case centering on whether Obamacare requires employers to pay for health care provisions that offend their religious beliefs . But during oral arguments, Justice Samuel Alito was skeptical. 'What I see are wild hypotheticals that are not obviously plausible and lack certainly any empirical support,' he told Verilli. In the end, Chief Justice Roberts had the last word, writing for the majority that '[c]ontributing money to a candidate is an exercise of an individual's right to participate in the electoral process through both political expression and political association.' 'A restriction on how many candidates and committees an individual may support is hardly a 'modest restraint' on those rights,' he added. 'The Government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse.'","Democratic Sen.

"Frustrated by an increase in petty crime, residents of an Oregon neighborhood have decided to arm themselves instead of calling the police. Residents of a Jennings Lodge neighborhood in Clackamas county, Ore., have put up fliers advertising their new policy, calling themselves the 'Glock Block', according to KOIN News. 'This is a Glock Block,' the fliers read. 'We don't call 911.' Fed-up: Residents of a Clackamas County, Ore., neighborhood have started posting fliers telling criminals they are a 'glock block' and that they don't rely on police for protection . Along with some of her neighbors, Coy Toloman has put up the fliers and gotten a concealed carry permit with the hopes of deterring criminals. While the increase in neighborhood crime is mostly petty, with incidents of vandalism and stolen law ornaments, Toloman has had enough. 'We’re starting a new group,' said Toloman, a resident of Milwaukie, which is just south of Portland, Ore. 'We don’t feel neighborhood watch is sufficient, and we don’t feel the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office is sufficient.' Toloman said a lawn statue she calls 'Lilly Rose' was stolen off her front porch. She chased after the thief but he got away. 'The radio was on,' she said of the incident.'If he'd gotten in the house...what then?' Toloman decided to take matters into her own hands, taking a class to get a concealed carry permit. Other neighbors also have permits, Toloman said, and they discus 'what kind of gun they have' and 'the best gun shop'.

"A family dog was tragically shot and killed by a passerby  suddenly jumped the fence while at a five-year-old's birthday party. The four-year-old Labrador, called Clifford, was allegedly gunned down by a man who was walking his border collie at the time in a suburb of Commerce City, Colorado. According to The Denver Post, when owner Emily Martinez and other guests, including children, went outside to help the dog and confront the shooter, he started pointing the gun at the them. Family dog: Clifford, pictured with one of the children of the owner Emily Martinez, was shot and killed by a dogwalker after it jumped over the fence during a birthday party in Commerce City, Colorado . Mrs Martinez, told the paper: 'We heard a noise, it sounded like a birthday balloon popping, except much louder. 'This guy had his gun pointed down at Clifford,' she added. 'He shot him twice in the neck.' The group rushed outside after they saw the suspect standing over the dog while he was still holding his gun. As they approached, he then turned and aimed at them. 'I was screaming for him to leave,' Mrs Martinez added. Tragedy: When the group rushed out to help the four-year-old Labrador, the shooter started aiming the gun at them . Commerce City police quickly responded to the home Saturday, after neighbors and guests had called 911. On Monday, the department said it is investigating the incident, adding that the shooter is being cooperative. Police said the owner of the border collie told them he shot Clifford after he was unable to separate the dogs. Afterward, neighbors and party guests told the Martinez family the shooter was calling out: 'I have a concealed weapon license,' as he walked away. The Martinez family told the paper that the man had been walking past their house for two months, and had stopped to complain about Clifford's barking. Raymond Martinez, Emily's husband, said there had been no big arguments, insisting that Clifford was not aggressive, and felt the deadly encounter could have been avoided if he had simply walked somewhere else.

"Just three days before a knife-wielding veteran broke into the White House, Secret Service let an armed felon ride in the same elevator as President Obama. The startling revelation that the commander-in-chief's life was compromised was  revealed today, as the director of the Secret Service testified before Congress to explain the recent lapses in security. The newest security slip-up happened on Mr Obama's September 16 trip to Atlanta, Georgia for a briefing on the Ebola crisis at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At the CDC, Mr Obama and his security detail entered an elevator when a contract security officer operating the lift started taking photos and video of the president. Scroll down for video . How did that happen? President Obama rode in the same elevators as a convicted felon carrying a handgun when he visited the CDC on September 16, it was revealed on Tuesday . Sources told the Washington Exmainer and Washington Post that the unnamed CDC officer ignored Secret Service orders to out the phone away, and continued to act 'oddly' and 'unprofessionally'. When the president got out of the elevator, some of his Secret Services officers stayed behind to question the CDC employee with his supervisor, at which point they discovered he had three prior convictions for assault and battery. When the supervisor fired the officer on the spot for acting 'highly irresponsible' she told him to hand over his gun - to the extreme shock of the Secret Service members present. Before the president travels anywhere, Secret Service are supposed to conduct background checks on employees who work at all the venues the president will visit. Anyone with a prior conviction is not usually allowed in the same room as the president, and only sworn law enforcement are allowed to carry guns. The unruly security officer checked both of those boxes but somehow managed to evade Secret Service's prior detection. Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, of Utah, was outraged to hear about the latest lapse in security. 'You have a convicted felon within arm’s reach of the president, and they never did a background check. Words aren’t strong enough for the outrage I feel for the safety of the president and his family,' Rep Chaffestz told the Washington Post. 'His life was in danger. This country would be a different world today if he had pulled out his gun,' he added. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson is reportedly having a top agency manager look into the matter. Director Pierson had her plate full today when she spent three hours being grilled by a Congressional committee on the job Secret Service has been doing as of late. Sorry: US Secret Service Director Julia Pierson apologized for a Sept. 19 White House perimeter breach by a man carrying a knife . It was also revealed in the hearing today that at least two uniformed officers noticed Army veteran Omar J Gonzales acting strange around the White House just before he jumped the fence and made it all the way to the East Room on September 19. Gonzalez had been stopped outside the White House before, carrying a small hatchet on August 25, and the officers remembered him from that run-in. However, Prison says they observed him 'for some time' on September 19, but did not intervene. 'It is clear that our security plan was not executed properly,' Pierson told lawmakers. 'I take full responsibility; what happened is unacceptable and it will never happen again.'

"Britain's population is growing at more than twice the European average. The number living in the UK soared by 400,000 last year – almost a third of the increase across all 27 EU countries. The rise is underpinned by high levels of migration and a baby boom itself brought about mainly by immigrants. Overcrowded? Britain will have the highest population in Europe within 40 years, according to projections made by Eurostat, the EU statistics agency . The figures from Eurostat, the statistical arm of the EU, are further evidence that England is becoming the most crowded country in Europe. Projections show that Britain will have the highest population on the continent within 40 years, overtaking both Germany and France. Eurostat said the UK's population growth of 409,000 in 2010 amounted to 30 per cent of the 1.4million added to numbers across the whole EU. The only other country to experience a population increase of more than 300,000 was France. Britain's population went up at a rate of 6.6 new people for every 1,000 already in the country, well over double the EU average rate of 2.8 for every 1,000. Only two countries – Belgium and Sweden – and the tiny nations of Malta and Luxembourg saw higher rates of increase. Baby boom: Around one in four babies is born to a mother born outside the UK. Picture posed by model . The figures will fuel concerns over the provision of housing and public services in crowded areas. Transport, schools, water and energy supplies are all in increasing demand as the UK population heads toward the landmark figure of 70million, which is expected to be reached in 25 years time. The EU analysis reflects the findings . of Whitehall officials in attributing two fifths of the population . increase to immigration and three fifths to 'natural change' – the . difference between numbers of babies born and the national death toll. However a substantial share of the baby boom, which is producing  birthrates which match the historic highs in the two decades after the Second World War, is largely a result of high migration. Around one in four babies is born to a mother who was born outside UK. Sir Andrew Green of the MigrationWatch think tank, said: 'This is a result of Labour's immigration policies which brought in three million migrants, raising our population both directly and indirectly. 'Many of the additional births over the past ten years have been to mothers born outside the UK.' A report yesterday revealed that UK migrants from one East African country are much more heavily dependent on the state to provide them with homes than people from any other minority group. Eight out of ten Somalis were found to live in homes provided by the taxpayer. Yet among every other immigrant nationality, more than half pay for their own housing either by renting it on the private market or through buying their homes. The findings come from the Institute for Public Policy Research and were revealed yesterday in a report by MigrationWatch. If the IPPR figures – calculated from official statistics – are correct, then the provision of homes for Somalis is likely have cost taxpayers more than £2billion. Whitehall officials estimate there are 150,000 Somalis in Britain, most of whom fled civil war and lawlessness that broke out in 1991. There has been outrage over Somali refugee Saeed Khaliif, who moved with his family into a £2m house in North-West London, at a cost to the public of £8,000 a month.","Britain set for Europe's highest population in 40 years .

"His legacy lives on: The remainder of Paul Walker's Fast & Furious 7 scenes will be filmed by brothers Cody and Caleb, it has been confirmed . Paul Walker's younger, lookalike brother has been asked to step in for him to film the final scenes for Fast & The Furious 7, it emerged today. The 40-year-old star was on a break from filming at the time of his death in a shocking car crash two weeks ago. And in a poignant tribute to the star, MailOnline can reveal Cody Walker, 25, who has worked as a movie stuntman, is set to take his place in the latest installment of the hit franchise. Following Paul's death, Universal Pictures announced it was their 'duty' to shut down production - adding they were 'dedicated to providing support to Paul's immediate family and our extended Fast & Furious family of cast, crew, and filmmakers.' A source close to production said today: 'Producers had a string of meetings right after Paul's death. 'They soon realized they needed someone who looked like Paul to finish the movie and that's when they approached his nearly identical brother, Cody.' Cody, who lives in Oregon, has been staying with his mother Cheryl in Los Angeles and helping to comfort her since his brother's death, and the source added: 'They can shoot Cody from behind and at distance and if it's a shot they need Paul's face in close up they can CGI it later on. 'If Cody agrees it's because he wants to honor his brother's memory. There are many details that still need to be worked out, but right now the family and cast and crew are all still grieving.' In addition to this, Universal have also made it clear they will work with the Walker family and take their guidance on a fitting exit for Paul's Fast & Furious character, Brian O'Connor, according to the source. Today, a spokesman for Universal told MailOnline: 'Right now, all of us at Universal are dedicated to providing support to Paul's immediate family and our extended Fast & Furious family of cast, crew and filmmakers. 'At this time we feel it is our responsibility to shut down production on Fast & Furious 7 for a period of time so we can assess all options available to move forward with the franchise.  We are committed to keeping Fast & Furious fans informed, and we will provide further information to them when we have it.  Until then, we know they join us in mourning the passing of our dear friend Paul Walker.'

This week, The Hollywood Reporter . reported that screenwriter Chris Morgan is hard at work on script . revisions to director James Wan’s Fast & The Furious 7 with hopes of . 'retiring' the character using footage that was shot before Paul passed . away in a car accident in Los Angeles on November 30. The magazine reported that the cast could be back to work as early as January on the sequel, but added: 'that’s a big if.' Sources told THR that Universal has 'already has poured about $150 . million into the film, a bill that its insurance firm, Fireman's Fund, . might have to pay in full if Universal concludes the picture must be . started anew.' Meanwhile, the Walker family gathered yesterday as the actor's remains were created ahead of a small funeral service tomorrow. According to RadarOnline, Paul's body was transferred from the mortuary at . Los Angeles cemetery Forest Lawn Memorial Park to a crematory in . Glendale, California . The . funeral will be held on the weekend and will be a family affair, although . it has been reported some of Paul's Fast & Furious co-stars such as Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Tyrese Gibson will attend. This week it was reported that the Walker family had watched a screening of Paul's last movie, The Hours at a theater in  La Canada Flintridge, California, according to US Weekly. 'His family was very stoic. But they enjoyed the film and had a really lovely evening,' said a spokesman. Paul's 15-year-old daughter Meadow, however, did not attend the screening as she and her grandfather, Paul Walker III, had already viewed the film at this year's Southwest Film Festival. Earlier . this week, the family claimed plastic road markers may have been . responsible for the crash that killed the star after stunt experts . claimed the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT driven by Paul's friend hit the . markers, called Bott's Dots, and careered out of control. bott's Dots: Paul Walker's family have claimed that experts have said that road markers called Bott's Dots (circled) may have been the cause of the crash that killed him . Total devastation: There was little left of the wreckage after impact, with investigators ruling that speed and not a mechanical fault was to blame for the tragedy . An integral part of the action: Paul, seen here in a 2001 shot with his The Fast & The Furious castmates, starred in five of the six films in the franchise, while he was halfway through shooting the seventh instalment when he tragically died in a car crash right out of the films' script . According to TMZ, . sources close to his family said that having visited the site, the . experts claimed the bumps may have caused the car to hydroplane, . resulting in the driver losing control. Paul and driver Roger Rodas died on November 30 when their car hit a pole and tree and caught fire in the Los Angeles suburb. The . experts told the family that the car could have lost traction after . hitting the bumps, which are used to separate lanes of traffic, and . skidded off the road. The claims come after question marks were raised over the safety of the car itself following the crash. The Porsche was being driven by the Hollywood star's friend and business partner Rodas. It has since emerged that car experts have long expressed concern about the souped-up model's suitability for the road, due to its ultra light carbon-fiber frame and 5.7 liter race-derived V10 engine. It has a flat out speed of 205 miles per hour and its design is derived from earlier Porsche Le Mans models. Porsche knew of the car's sensitivity . when they launched the model in 2004. According to TMZ, a memo . circulated to sales staff said of the GT Carrera: 'This vehicle cannot . drive over a Foster Beer can that is lying on its side.' 'You need to be aware of what type of road surface you are on (dips; pot holes, seam heights, etc.) 'The Carrera GT is as close to a racecar as we will ever get, this car has all the disadvantages of a racecar. His final moments: The heartthrob is pictured in the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT just moments before it careered off the road and hit a tree and a pole, killing him and driver Roger Rodas in a fiery explosion . Police have revealed that a second man . has been charged with stealing a piece of the wreckage of the Porsche . that Walker was a passenger in when he was killed. Anthony Janow, 25, was released on $60,000 bail following the charges. Prosecutors say that Janow and 18-year-old Jameson Witty stole a roof panel from the wreck as it was being towed away from the site. The pair could face up to four-and-a-half years in prison for the offense. Witty, who is also free on bail, was caught on video stealing the T-top roof of the Porsche right off the tow truck and afterwards he even bragged about the heist by posting pics of the stolen wreckage on Instagram. The wrecked Porsche Carrera GT was being hauled by a flat-bed tow truck hours after the wreck that claimed the movie star and friend Roger Rodas, who was driving the vehicle when it crashed. The tow truck stopped at a red light and a male jumped out of a car following it to grab a piece of the car – he then hopped back into his car and sped away, according to police. The tow truck driver immediately reported the theft. A search warrant was executed on Thursday, and police found the stolen car panel - a part from the sports car's roof. Witty has since taken to Instagram to apologize for his actions. 'I wanted to say my intentions for the piece I took off the two truck were to make a memorial out of it. Paul was a childhood idol to me and many. The investigation into the crash that killed both Walker and Rodas is still ongoing.","Cody Walker, 25, may film scenes as a poignant tribute to the star who died in a fiery car crash last month .

"On D-Day, they defied fierce German shelling and machine gun fire to reach the Normandy beaches. Seventy years on, and much frailer, our Second World War heroes have come up against a new adversary as they return for the landmark anniversary... French bureaucrats. The authorities require veterans’ groups to complete lengthy forms at short notice or risk being turned away from the battle sites on June 6. Ken Smith, 89, was one of the youngest – and luckiest – soldiers to survive the D-Day landings after a radio he was carrying on his back deflected two bullets. Paperwork: D-Day veteran Ken Smith who braved bullets and barbed wire to storm the Normandy beaches 70 years ago face a new obstacle to this summer's commemoration - French bureaucracy . The former signals operator, who is . organising an anniversary trip  for 40 people, was given just four . weeks’ notice of the demands. ‘We didn’t need to fill in a load of paperwork last time I landed in Normandy,’ he said. ‘I didn’t even need my passport.’ A . two-page form must be completed for every person attending, including . personal information and contact details, as well as rank, regiment, . ‘role’ performed on D-Day, medals awarded, events they plan to attend . and details of their travel arrangements. D-Day . veteran Ken Smith, (pictured in his uniform) is now 89 and is one of . the youngest making the trip. He was struck by machine gun fire as he . waded ashore . Mr . Smith, from York, was forced to spend hours on the phone, along with . his wife Gloria, to gather all the required details from the veterans, . their carers and friends in their  party in order to fill in the 80 . pages of forms by last weekend’s deadline. He said the red tape has been far greater on this occasion than for other commemorative events he has attended. ‘The . French have never done anything on this scale before so it’s been quite . a shock. Most of the veterans are in wheelchairs or need walking . frames, so it’s not as if they present any kind of security threat at . all. ‘There is a lot of disgruntlement and dismay among veterans, particularly since this has been so late in the day.’ He . said this is not the first time veterans have been upset by the . attitude of the French authorities during commemorative visits. On one . occasion, former soldiers had to stand in the rain for hours during . speeches, and were then refused permission to collect dry clothes from . their coach. Police have . also stopped disabled veterans being dropped off close to their hotels, . meaning they have had to be carried, Mr Smith said. This . year’s event is the last  to be officially marked by  the Normandy . Veterans’ Association, which is scheduled to disband in November. Secretary . George Batts said: ‘Everybody going to Normandy is affected by this. The forms have got to be filled in and if they are not filled in they . don’t go. Full stop.’ A Ministry of Defence spokesman said it was working closely with the association to ensure everyone is registered. War: Soldiers land on the French coast in Normandy during the D-Day invasion on June 6, 1944. Veterans who fought there have complained about the red tape which is holding up commemoration plans . He . added: ‘As a major anniversary, significantly more people than normal . are planning to attend this year’s commemorations, putting significant . pressure on the transport network, and as a result the French . authorities will be putting in place stringent access control.’ It . is also feared some veterans hoping to attend the Normandy events may . not know about the requirements and have already missed the official . deadline. French police are planning to cordon off the relevant beaches and surrounding areas between June 4 and June 8. All visitors will require an official pass and vehicles must have security stickers. Those who have missed the deadline will now have to apply directly to the French government if they wish to attend. Today: Omaha Beach, Normandy. Nine hundred members of the British . Normandy Veterans' Association will be among thousands returning to the . scene of bloody sacrifice in June . Ukip . leader Nigel Farage condemned the veterans’ treatment, saying: ‘French . bureaucracy is what the whole European system is based on. ‘If any British veteran was not allowed to go because he had not filled in a form that would be completely outrageous.’ The MOD says any veteran, family member, or carer planning to attend needs to register their details in advance for access to the invasion beaches and surrounding areas, such as Arromanches, Bayeux, Caen, Ouistreham and the American sector. A spokesman said: 'As a major anniversary, significantly more people than normal are planning to attend this year's commemorations, putting significant pressure on the transport network, and as a result the French authorities will be putting in place stringent access control. 'We are working closely with the Normandy Veterans' Association and the Royal British Legion to ensure that all veterans wishing to attend the commemorations have all the information and support they need to register for the key events.' The MoD has stopped processing forms for non-veterans - who now have to apply direct to the French authorities and supply photo ID. Mr Batts has apologised to members that the time limit for the return of the forms could not be extended. 'This was due to procrastination by the French Government and therefore completely beyond our control,' he wrote to branches.","Nine hundred members of the British .

"A much-loved police dog killed in a stand-off with a cornered gunman in New York today will be honored in a memorial service for paying the 'ultimate sacrifice for his companions'. Ape, a Czech German Shepherd, was killed by Kurt Myers when officers stormed the abandoned bar he was holed up in in Herkimer County today at 8am. Myers was shot and killed in return fire. Police say the 64-year-old randomly shot four people dead at a barber shop and car wash across the towns of Mohawk and Herkimer yesterday . Killed: Ape, a Czech German Shepherd, was shot dead today in the stand-off in upstate New York . The 2-year-old dog was on his second FBI mission and will be buried back at the police academy in Quantico, Virginia, where he completed his four month special training on February 25. Special Agent Ann Todd said: 'Ape was doing what he was trained to do and made the ultimate sacrifice for his team. His actions were heroic and prevented his teammates from being seriously wounded or killed.' 'K-9s are a tremendous asset in tactical operations and enhance the safety of law enforcement personnel who routinely confront complex and high-risk threats'. 'He will be missed by his FBI family.' Dogs are often used in stand off situations to help officers locate suspects whose whereabouts are unknown. Dedicated officers tried to keep Ape alive with CPR after he was shot in the chest following the morning shoot-out. Facebook memorial pages have been set up in dedication to the Tactical K-9 by people moved by the sacrifice of the animal. His name will be added to a memorial wall at the police training facility after the service. State Police Superintendent Joseph D’Amico said the dogs are used because they are 'much more acute than people in locating suspects, especially in certain types of premises. I think that's what happened here, and as unfortunate as it is that the K-9 lost his life, it could have easily been an officer'. Police had been engaged in a 15-hour stand-off with Myers before the shooting. Suspect: Police say Kurt Myers, 64, fatally shot four people yesterday . Myers' killing rampage had started early Wednesday after he allegedly ignited a fire in his apartment in the nearby village of Mohawk, which is about 80 miles northeast of Albany. Myers then drove to John's Barber Shop around the corner and used a shotgun to kill two customers, who were identified as Harry Montgomery, 68, and Michael Ransear, 57, a retired corrections officer. The shop's owner, John Seymour, and another customer, Dan Haslauer, were listed in critical condition at a Utica hospital. Police Superintendent Joseph D'Amico said the gunman then drove to . Gaffy's Fast Lube in nearby Herkimer and used the shotgun to kill Thomas . Stefka, an employee, and Michael Renshaw, a customer who was a 23-year . veteran of the state Department of Corrections. John Seymour, the barber shop owner, told his sister, Mary Hornett, that the attack came out of nowhere. ‘He just said that the guys were in the . barbershop and this guy comes in and he says, 'Hi John, do you remember . me?' and my brother said, 'Yes, Kurt, how are you?' and then he just . started shooting,’ Hornett said. Victims: A memorial sits on a vehicle outside John's Barber Shop, where two customers were killed . [caption . Hornett said her brother, who was . hospitalized in critical condition, was doing well after being shot in . the left hand and right hip. ‘My brother couldn't think of any reason why he would do such a thing,’ she said of Myers, a former customer who hadn't been in the shop for a . couple of years. Cuomo called the shooting spree ‘truly an inexplicable situation.’ ‘There's no apparent motive to the best of our knowledge at this time to provoke these attacks,’ he said. D'Amico said police had not had any communication with Myers, whose only known police record was a 1973 drunken-driving arrest. Dog support: A police officer with a dog ducks for cover as gunshots were heard not far from where Myers was holed up . Hiding: Myers was in the shuttered Glory Days Food & Spirits shop, pictured, in downtown Herkimer . Neighbors said they barely knew Myers, who rarely spoke, and left every morning in his red Jeep. Traci Randall said the only time she . remembers speaking to her next-door neighbor was when he yelled at her . son because he thought he had shot an air pellet at his Jeep. ‘He was a great guy, a really nice person. This is horrific. We really couldn't believe it,’ she said. ‘He would walk by himself. He was kind of a loner. No wife,’ she said. Michele Mlinar, a bartender at . Cangee's Bar and Grille in Herkimer, said Myers frequently went in and . had a bottle or two of Coors Light and left without speaking to anyone. She said he was always alone and she didn't even know his name until . police released his mug shot on Wednesday. Cangee's owner Candy Rellin called Myers ‘just an odd little man.’ The two villages are about 65 miles . east of Syracuse, on opposite sides of the Mohawk River in a region . known as the Mohawk Valley. James Baron, the mayor of Mohawk . described his village as close-knit and friendly, ‘the kind of place . where you'd say, ""Oh, it would never happen here.""' Harry Montgomery Sr. of Mohawk was among the victims who were shot and killed at John’s Barber Shop. Montgomery, 68, was visiting the shop for a haircut, according to his son. 'My sister was . at the bank, cashing a check when she heard all the commotion,' Montgomery told the Observer-Dispatch. 'She came out to see what was . going on and found out it was Dad who got shot.' On the run: Police say Kurt Meyers fatally shot two people at John's Barber Shop in Mohawk and then shot and killed two more people less than two miles away at Gaffey's Fast Lube in the village of Herkimer .

After the service, Mr Marshall said: ‘I think he (Sidney) would have been flabbergasted. We just expected a few RAF here. ‘We didn’t expect half of Blackpool to turn up. ‘It has been unbelievable, we even got a bunch of flowers from America - we don’t know who sent them.’ His son Trevor Marshall, 52, from Doncaster, also attended his uncle’s funeral. He said: ‘It’s a bit overwhelming for us as a family but nice that people have come out and shown their respects.’ Hundreds of people turned out to pay their last respects to Sidney Marshall at his funeral at Lytham Cemetery . Undertaker Eddie Jacobs asked for Armed Forces personnel past and present together with members of the public to attend Mr Marshall's funeral . Paying tribute to the RAF serviceman, undertaker Eddie Jacobs described him as a 'smashing bloke' and said his funeral turnout was 'amazing' An RAF contingent donned their uniform and medals to pay tribute to fellow serviceman Sidney Marshall . Mr Marshall, who flew 28 sorties as a . mid-upper gunner including long flights over enemy territory to attack . heavily-defended targets, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal . (DFM) for his bravery before his death. On a daylight attack on Bergen on January 12 1945, re-crossing the Norwegian coast, his aircraft was attacked by five FW190s. The attack lasted 32 minutes and the Lancaster’s starboard outer engine was hit and left smoking and his gun turret was also in flames. Mr Marshall’s DFM citation said there was ‘no doubt’ that the flight sergeant’s ‘coolness and skill greatly contributed to the saving of the aircraft’. On another occasion, over occupied France on the night of July 4 1944, he brought down an Me110 attacking his Lancaster. Paying tribute to the RAF serviceman, Mr Jacobs described him as a ‘smashing bloke’ and said his funeral turnout was ‘amazing’. He said: ‘The turn-out was absolutely brilliant, there was between 600 and 700 people there which is amazing considering how wet it was. They were all there to celebrate a wonderful life. After the service, brother Bill Marshall said: 'I think he (Sidney) would have been flabbergasted. We just expected a few RAF here. We didn¿t expect half of Blackpool to turn up' RAF warrant officer Sidney Marshall died alone after his wife Elizabeth (pictured together above) died last year . Mourners young and old (right) turned out to pay tributes to the war veteran after undertaker Eddie Jacobs put an emotional appeal in a local newspaper (left) last month asking for people to attend the war hero's funeral . ‘We gave him a great send off, there . were lots of soldiers there, including men currently serving in Sid’s . old RAF Marhan - Nine Squadron. ‘Sid . would actually have been embarrassed by the funeral. He was a quiet and . private man, he didn’t want any flowers, just his hat and his medals. ‘But he would have been pleasantly embarrassed. He was a smashing bloke.’ The service was the second time Mr Jacobs has called for mourners to attend a war hero’s funeral. In November the undertaker, of Roland L. Whitehead and Daughter Funeral Directors, organised a send-off for World War II veteran Harold Jellicoe Percival. Dozens left floral tributes for the war hero who passed away in June just over a year after wife Elizabeth died . At the funeral service, the hymns I Vow To Thee My Country and Jerusalem were sung before the Last Post was played and the Ode of Remembrance recited. Pictured: Floral tributes for Mr Marshall . Mr Percival, who also lived in Lytham St Annes, was one of the last surviving Dambusters. The service, which drew in more than 1,000 people, coincided with Armistace Day. Mr Jacobs said: ‘It’s not really a cause I’m fighting, it’s just how it’s happened. ‘Any old soldier that has performed like that for his country deserves a bit of recognition.’","RAF gunner Sidney Marshall died at his Lancashire home aged 90 on June 16 .

"Korean giant LG has become the latest television maker to offer Google's web TV service built in to its flatscreens. Sony already offers the service on a small number of sets in America, and Samsung is to build televisions with the web-TV service, which offers  access to TV from HBO, CNBC and Netflix, as well as web, social networking, apps and games. With backing from big electronics companies, Google's service could hit the mainstream this year - long before the rumoured Apple iTV service goes on sale. The device could be a new version of Google TV, a web-streaming service which the search giant launched in 2010, but which has remained unpopular . Google TV will offers web access via its Chrome browser, and apps and games similar to the ones on Google's Android devices - but all redesigned to be easily usable via a remote control from the sofa. The sets connect to a home internet network, and also offer access to YouTube's steadily increasing number of TV channels. The service has yet to launch in Europe. In America, it has so far met mixed reviews, and widespread indifference. Logitech, makers of one of the first Google TV devices - a set-top box - lost a reported $100 million on their gadgets. Television channels such as NBC have blocked their web-TV offerings from appearing on Google TV devices. But with an increasing number of major tech companies backing it, the service seems to be in with a chance again in 2012. LG's offering will offer Google TV along with 3D. Havis Kwon, LG's CEO  said, 'Through Google TV, LG has merged Google’s established Android operating system with LG’s proven 3D and Smart TV technologies.' The televisions will also have a QWERTY keypad on LG's Magic Remote - making for easier web searches via Google's Chrome browser. LG claims that the sets can also multi-task, running social networking such as Facebook in the backrground, or even putting web TV on pause to do a Google search.","Service offers TV from HBO, Netflix, CNBC .

"A campaign aimed at destroying the Islamic State  in Syria and Iraq could outlast Barack Obama’s presidency, senior officials have warned. It comes as it was revealed that a three-step strategy is being planned in a bid to overthrow the militants in a campaign that could last up to three years. The first step is already underway and has involved dozens of airstrikes in the past month as part of moves to protect  U.S. personnel and ethnic minorities and halting ISIS progress in parts of western and northern Iraq. A campaign aimed at destroying The Islamic State in Syria and Iraq could outlast Barack Obama’s presidency, senior officials have warned . According to the New York Times, the next phase in the campaign could involve renewed efforts to train up and equip Kurdish fighters and that could even mean training up members of Sunni tribes. A final phase, which the newspaper suggests would be the 'most politically controversial', could involve tackling the terrorists in Syria in a campaign that Pentagon officials believe may last three years. In an interview with CNN last week, Obama's deputy national security adviser, Tony Blinken said of the mission: ‘It’s going to take time, and it will probably go beyond even this administration to get to the point of defeat.' The president is expected to officially unveil the United States’ plan for overthrowing the militants in an address to the nation on Wednesday. Obama told NBC in an interview that aired on Sunday morning that he would meet with lawmakers on Tuesday to give them the opportunity to scrutinize his plans before making a formal announcement the following day. Kurdish fighters take up positions at the Khazir front line in Iraq. A three step strategy is being planned by the U.S. in a bid to overthrow the militants in a campaign that could last up to three years . President Barack Obama said in an interview that aired Sunday on Meet the Press that he would unveil his strategy to defeat ISIS in an address on Wednesday . 'We are going to be a part of an international coalition, carrying out air strikes in support of work on the ground by Iraqi troops, Kurdish troops,' he said in the interview. 'We are going to systematically degrade their capabilities. We're going to shrink the territory that they control. And ultimately we're going to defeat them.' In previewing his strategy to Meet the Press host Chuck Todd, Obama acknowledged that there would be a military component to taking down the religious extremists and it would 'require some resources ... above what we are currently doing'. But the Commander in Chief indicated this would not mean putting troops on the ground in Iraq or Syria. 'I'm preparing the country to make sure that we deal with a threat from ISIL,' he said. 'This is not going to be an announcement on about U. S. ground troops,' he said. 'This is not the equivalent of the Iraq war.' 'The notion that the United States should be putting boots on the ground would be a profound mistake,' Obama told Todd. The U.S. does not have the resources to 'serially occupy various countries all around the Middle East,' he said. Obama ordered air strikes in northern Iraq last month as Kurdish-controlled territory fell to the Islamic State and the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan looked endangered. Last weekend, U.S. warplanes carried out raids farther south in the province of Saluhuddin to break an Islamic State siege of the Shi'ite Turkmen town of Amerli. Monday morning Reuters reported that U.S. warplanes had carried out five strikes on Islamic State insurgents around Iraq's Haditha Dam yesterday. Obama has branded the Islamic State as an acute threat to the West and the Middle East and said that key NATO allies stood ready to back Washington in action against the well-armed sectarian force, which has seized expanses of northern Iraq and eastern Syria. The strikes were Washington's first reported offensive into Anbar since it started attacks on Islamic State forces in the north of Iraq in August.","Campaign to destroy ISIS could outlast Obama's administration, officials say .

"A photographer has created his own surrealist dreamworld to escape the boredom of his day job. Logan Zillmer, 28, used pictures taken every day for year to put together a collection of mind-bending illusions, including a floating house and mystical forest, to feed his creative urges. The conceptual photographer from Michigan, who works as a retail manager by day, then combined the images in layers to create the stunning dream-like pictures. Mind-bending: Conceptual photographer Logan Zillmer, 28, took an image a day for a year - using them to create surreal images. Here he is seen staring at a house suspended by a balloon . Hanging on: The retail manager from Michigan was bored of his job and felt the need to ignite his creative urge . Jumping through hoops: Mr Zillmer took a number of photographs and enhanced them to create images that would be nearly impossible in the real world . Rocket power: The collection - including this image of Mr Zillmer strapped to a rocket - stretches the boundaries of reality . He said: 'The retail job is my ""real person job"" but I would argue that it makes me less of a real person. Photography has always been second nature to me, both because I've done it since I was 15 and because it is just how my mind works. 'It was time to realise the full potential of my creativity, and what better way to do so than to exercise it every day?' he added. 'I suppose you could call it surrealism. For me, it is just a further investigation of the unknown and the unknowable.' When Mr Zillmer had lucid dreams, he wrote them down in an idea journal. He would then try to translate the visions into an image. 'Everything I photograph is real, and made to look real, but it is simply ordered in a way that renders the scene unreal.' The runaways: This image shows a suitcase being flung out of the back of the car, with Mr Zillmer's female passenger desperately trying to retrieve it . Reflection: This picture from the collection shows him climbing a step ladder and removing a piece of the blue sky . Images in the project include one which sees the photographer taking the sun from the sky to inspect it, and another in which a castle is carried away by a balloon. He said: 'When you write everything down that you think of, sometimes you will get some crazy stuff.' Mr Zillmer has a degree in film and has been interested in cinema and photography since he was in high school. Until the beginning of 2013 Mr Zillmer was only interested in documentary making but after a series of failed attempts to get films made he was led back to photography. He said: 'I let my imagination take the lead and it became apparent very quickly that through conceptual and surreal photography my voice speaks the loudest and with the most conviction I have realized recently that I only really care about two things: love and inspiration. Everything else is just a job.' He and his wife Whitney are expecting twins and though the project was hard on both of them he is happy to have completed it. It was not easy for her. She had to deal with everything while I was doing this. She is amazing.' Sneak peak: Standing in wintry conditions, Mr Zillmer pushes aside a curtain to reveal a sunnier scene behind . Fallen: Mr Zillmer stands next to the sun which has dropped from the sky and melted a gap in the snow . Trip: A shoe flies in the air as Mr Zillmer is seen periously falling backwards down a set of stairs . Fire: This incredible image shows the photographer bursting into flames in the middle of a lake while lighting a cigarette . Burn after reading: The newspaper suddenly bursts into flames in this photo  while a concerned Mr Zillmer is reading it . Stunning: The photographer used multiple photos of biplanes to create this image of the aircraft soaring overhead . A miniature world: Mr Zillmer walks towards a ray of sunshine which has broken through a gap in the trees of this mystical forest .","Logan Zillmer, 28, from Michigan, produced the dream-like images by combining layers of photography .

"The teenage victims of the Zanzibar acid attack may have been targeted in a revenge attack by a spurned admirer, according to friends on the idyllic island. Kirstie Trup and Katie Gee, both 18, were still in hospital in London last night after being flown back from Africa by air ambulance on Friday. They had been walking to meet friends for dinner when two men on a passing moped splashed battery acid over them on Wednesday. Scroll down for videos . Acid attack victims: Katie Gee (left) and Kirstie Trup (right), both 18, were still in hospital in London last night after being flown back from Africa by air ambulance on Friday .

The burning caused severe injuries . which are likely to need multiple operations. Both girls are expected to . spend several more days at the burns unit at Chelsea and Westminster . Hospital. Friends in . Zanzibar City, where the girls had been teaching, have said that the . pair received unwanted attention from young men in the days before the . attack. The departure of a male friend earlier in the week had left them more vulnerable, they added. The dormitories where Katie and Kirstie were staying with other voluntary workers were often surrounded by local teenage boys.

Appreciation: Katie Gee tweeted her gratitude for the support she has been given since the attack . he injuries of one of the volunteer (Katie, left, and Kirstie, right) is believed to more severe .

Home: Kirstie Trup, 18, lives on this road in affluent Hampstead, north London . One nearby resident, named only as Abdul because of the fear of reprisals, said the young men were angered at being rebuffed. Two . suspects have been arrested on Zanzibar in connection with the  acid . attack as a hate preacher who went on the run after being shot by police . was apprehended on the mainland. Extremist cleric Sheikh Issa Ponda . Issa has links to radical Islamist group Uamsho which police believe may . be involved in the assault. Acid attacks have become the . hallmark of the group which wants Zanzibar’s independence from Tanzania . and Sharia law on the island. Sheikh Ponda was shot by police as . they tried to arrest him but escaped, bleeding profusely. He later . surrendered and was being treated in hospital last night. Witnesses said . police surrounded him in Morogoro, 200 miles from Dar es Salaam, but . were pelted with stones by his followers. Officers were seen shooting into . the air as a warning and it is believed Sheikh Ponda was hit in the . shoulder by a tear-gas canister. He visited Zanzibar in the weeks . leading up to the attack on Katie Gee and Kirstie Trup and was seen . encouraging his supporters to protest against ‘colonisation’ from . Christians and inciting Muslim youths to violence. The two suspects under arrest are among eight people brought in for questioning by police. He . said: ‘There were a lot of girls staying in the house. Sometimes boys . come over. They make so many comments to the girls. They want to go . abroad. But the girls told them to go away.’ Katie . and Kirstie, who are both from Jewish families in affluent Hampstead, . north west London, are members of The Abstinence Club, a group of 100 . London teenagers who promote celibacy as ‘the only reliable form of . contraception’. They also knew to dress appropriately for the mainly Muslim island’s cultural traditions, according to Katie’s mother Nicky Gee. Surgeon Mohammed Jidawi, who treated . the girls immediately after the attack, said Katie, who received the . worse injuries, has burns to 80 per cent of her right arm and 50 per . cent of her torso. Medical student Olivia Moore, a friend of the girls, said she thought it had been a targeted attack. She . told Channel 4 from Zanzibar: ‘The two men were on a moped and they . went past a group of tourists and then stopped for the girls. 'The two men then looked at each . other, they nodded, and then the man on the back of the bike smiled and . threw acid on the girls. There was no incident that preceded the actual . attack.’ Threats of acid attacks are not . uncommon on the island. Tourists rebuffing touts offering cheap goods . are often told: ‘For 500 shillings I can destroy your face.’ Members . of both families spent the weekend with the girls. A hospital spokesman . said: ‘They are still comfortable and in a stable condition. Doctors . are continuing to assess treatment options.’ Kirstie’s father Marc Trup, a property investor, said both girls were ‘struggling to come to terms’ with their burns.","Kirstie Trup and Katie Gee, both 18, still in London hospital last night .

"You might be happy popping a homemade ice cube into your drink to cool down, but celebrities and the super wealthy are now demanding premium blocks to go with their elaborate cocktails. ‘Luxury’ ice cubes have been designed to accompany premium drinks - and a bag of 50 will set you back a staggering $325.50 (£194). While the price tag may be high, the company that makes them in Davis, California, claims they last longer and are healthier than the ordinary cubes found in a freezer. Cool? Luxury ice cubes (pictured) have been designed to accompany premium drinks - and a bag of 50 cost $325 (£194). They are perfectly clear and are individually cut form giant blocks of ice . Gläce Luxury Ice Co’s cubes provide ‘minimum dilution and maximum cooling’ and claim to be completely tasteless to allow consumers to ‘maximise the beverage experience’ at parties such as LA Fashion Week and at the Playboy Mansion. But all these attributes come at a cost - with a bag of 50 ice cubes priced at $325 (£194). While most people are happy filling up a plastic tray with tap water and stashing it in their freezer for a sunny day, the company said that such common methods could be detrimental to their health. ‘Traditional machine-ice, generally made with local tap water, may contain upwards of 150 impurities and carcinogens, resulting in poor tasting and potentially unhealthy ice,’ the firm claimed. In contrast, Gläce Ice – which comes in both cubes and perfect spheres – is completely clear and contains no impurities. Gläce Luxury Ice Co's cubes and spheres (pictured) provide 'minimum dilution and maximum cooling' and claim to be completely tasteless to allow consumers to 'maximise the beverage experience' at parties such as the LA Fashion Week and at the Playboy Mansion . The ‘Mariko’ spheres are the ‘most mathematically efficient way to cool your drink,’ the company continued. Its ethos is that quality drinks deserve quality cooling. ‘Purified of minerals, additives and other pollutants that may contaminate the taste of premium spirits and drinks, Gläce Ice pieces are meticulously crafted to deliver the finest complement to top shelf liquors,’ according to the company’s website. The company claims that normal ice made in machines and plastic trays (pictured) can contain up to 150 impurities and carcinogens . Like fine wine, the firm recommends the ice cubes are left to breathe for a few minutes before any liquid is . poured onto them, but they do not break apart like ‘less deserving ice’ upon contact with a warmer liquid. The cubes are ‘individually carved’ from a 300lb (136kg) block of purified ice, which might go some way to justify its price tag. Their shape measures 2.5inches (6cm) across. The spheres can last in a drink for 20 to 30 minutes, while the 'G-cubed' ice shapes endure for up to 40 minutes - although there is no comparison to similar sized and shaped ‘normal’ ice cubes available. Giant blocks of pristine ice, from which the cubes are carved, are made by freezing water from the outside so the centre of the ice is stirred to allow gases to escape. When it is almost frozen, it is drained and replaced with sprayed layers to make it perfectly clear, Priceonomics reported. The company was founded by Roberto Sequeira, a business school lecturer at the University of Los Angeles who came up with the idea for his company when he was dreaming up the 'perfect' business that is niche, high margin and scalable. It is calculated that a block of ice measuring 8,000 cubic inches (20,320 cubic cm) costs between $60 (£36) and $100 (£60) and is enough to make 500 of the luxury ice cubes. As Gläce sells them for $325 (£194) for a bag of 50, one $100 (£60) ice block could make a staggering $3,250 (£1,937) for the firm – although this has not be verified. And if the ice cubes do melt, they are contained in re-sealable bags with a one-way air valve to push out possibly dirty ambient air, so at least you will have a bag full of luxurious clean water.","A company in California makes ice cubes for celebrity events .

"This is the touching moment a giraffe bid a sad farewell to a dying worker who had spent his entire adult life cleaning the animal's enclosure at a Dutch zoo.

"Four Islamic extremists admitted plotting a terrorist attack on British soil armed with guns and home-made bombs. The men were caught after in a massive multi-million pound surveillance operation by police and the security services. Hidden bugs recorded them discussing methods, materials and targets for a terrorist attack, including using improvised explosive devices. The four men appeared at Woolwich Crown Court and pleaded guilty to a single terrorism charge . They downloaded illicit online terrorist instructions, purchased survival equipment and collected thousands of pounds to fund the plot. Investigators looked on as they organised and undertook physical training and prepared to send others to Al-Qaeda camps in Pakistan. But they were arrested at their homes in Luton, Bedfordshire, following a huge operation by the police and the security services. The men involved were Zahid Iqbal, 31, Mohammed Sharfaraz Ahmed, 25, Umar Arshad, 24, and Syed Farhan Hussain, 21. They admitted a single terrorism charge at high-security Woolwich Crown Court just weeks before they were due to face trial. The court was told the offences took place between January 2011 and April last year. All four men are of Pakistani origin. Their plea came a week after three Birmingham men were convicted of the biggest British terrorist plot for six years. The home-grown terrorists boasted they would kill more people than the July 7 bombers and wanted to create another landmark date alongside 9/11. Irfan Naseer, Irfan Khalid and Ashik Ali masterminded a conspiracy to attack unknown targets in their home town. They too were caught after a huge surveillance operation when two of them returned from a terrorist training camp on the lawless Afghan border. Naseer, a pharmacy graduate, was trained in making improvised bombs from chemical sports injury cold packs but their plans were smashed by police. The trio were also caught with material by Anwar Al Awlaki and worshipped Mohammed Sidique Khan, who led the July 2005 atrocities. The four Luton men face substantial prison sentences when they return to be sentenced by Mr Justice Wilkie on April 15.

"Abu Wa'el Dhiab, pictured, claims the process of force feeding him is abusive . The White House wants a court hearing into a Guantanamo Bay prisoner held without trial since August 2002 held in secret. Abu Wa'el Dhiab, from Syria, has been on hunger strike and claims that attempts by medics to force feed him are abusive. However, the Obama administration claims that much of the information about Dhiab is highly classified and cannot be discussed in open court. The Justice Department claims that 'an open hearing risks unauthorized disclosure of classified or protected information. The record in this case is large, with classified and protected information often inextricably intertwined with unclassified information'. Dhiab's legal team claims that their client has to be forcibly removed from his cell by guards, and strapped to a chair where the force feeding is carried out. The Defense Department counters that they only force feed patients against their will to keep them alive. The hearing is due to take place on October 6 where three doctors will give evidence about the mental and physical impact of force feeding. Dhaib's lawyer Jon Eisenberg said they will present 32 video tapes showing the force feeding process. Eisenberg said: 'This hearing is going to be much like a full-blown trial. What the government is seeking to do is to keep all of it secret.' The Justice Department said that any unclassified materiel would be released and a public version of the case transcripts would be published. The former Navy commander at Guantanamo Bay, Rear Admiral Richard Butler, said in a court declaration filed in July that even though the forced cell extraction videos are lawful, humane and appropriate, they 'are particularly susceptible to use as propaganda and to incite a public reaction because of their depiction of forcible ... guard interaction with detainees.' The videos that also contain footage of forced-feedings could be used 'to foment anti-American sentiment and inflame Muslim sensitivities as it depicts ... personnel providing medical care to a detainee while he is restrained,' Butler said in the declaration. Human rights activists have campaigned for the closure of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, pictured . The prison is based in Guantanamo Naval Station in Cuba, pictured, was opened in 2002 after the 9/11 attacks . Releasing a video showing a detainee receiving medical care while restrained 'would exacerbate the world's perception of detainees in U.S. custody,' Butler added. 'Public release, in whole or in part, of videos showing forced cell extractions' or feedings would cause 'serious damage to national security'. Dhiab, 42, was categorised as being suitable for release and resettlement in 2009 and has not been charged with any offence. Hunger strikes at Guantanamo began shortly after the prison opened in 2002, with force-feeding starting in early 2006 following a mass hunger strike. A new strike began in February 2013, with more than 100 of 154 prisoners in custody participating at one point. There are currently 149 prisoners at the detention center, and Crider has said the legal team believes roughly 34 are on hunger strike and some 18 meet the guidelines for feedings. Dhiab started his hunger strike 18 months ago as a protest against his indefinite detention at Guantanamo Bay. Medical staff at Guantanamo Bay use this nasal tube to force feed Dhiab when he refuses to eat . In July, the Pentagon agreed to transfer Dhiab and five other prisoners to Uruguay, which has agreed to give them asylum. The men are unable to return to their own homes because of the threat to their lives. Dhiab was arrested in Pakistan, where he claims he was a honey salesman. His legal team said he has been forcibly extracted from his cell almost 50 times this year. However, camp officials claim that Dhiab has been abusive to guards, threatening to kill or seriously injure them. He said since April he has tried to assault troops three times and twice used vomit and faeces as weapons.","Abu Wa'el Dhiab was sent to Camp Delta Guantanamo Bay in August 2002 .

"The Adastra superyacht is a floating pleasure palace that would fit as comfortably in outer space as it would on the open sea. And as these amazing new pictures show, she is equipped to entertain a billionaire with even the highest of standards. She is the the new pet of Hong Kong-based shipping magnate Anto Marden, whose uses for her may include - among other things - gliding between the two tropical islands he already owns off the coast of Indonesia. Scroll down for video . Futuristic: The main deck area looks more like that on a spaceship than a boat . Designed by Sussex-based yacht designer John Shuttleworth, the Adastra is so high-tech, it can even be controlled remotely at the touch of an iPad... as long as you don't get any further away than 50 metres. Owner: Anto Marden, who is based in Hong Kong, made his fortune in the shipping industry . The yacht's high-concept, space-age look is no gimmick. The shape has . been specially developed to cut through waves as it glides across the high seas. Described as ‘one of the world's most amazing super yachts’, Adastra, unveiled yesterday in China, took five years to build, is 42.5 metres long, 16 metres wide and weighs 52 . tons. Her enormous petrol tank coupled with her dynamic sailing efficiency allows the Adastra to travel up to 4,000 miles without refuelling - the same distance from London to New York. ‘It takes the power trimaran concept further than has ever been . attempted before,’ Mr Shuttleworth told Boat International. ‘The challenge of turning this . concept into a viable luxury yacht has taken us to further research and . to develop new thinking on stability and comfort at sea for this type of . craft.’ It is the result of five years of planning and construction, and rivals anything owned by yacht-lover Roman Abramovich. The hull of the Adastra is built from glass and Kevlar and can house nine guests and six crewmen. The deck saloon has a panoramic view while the open cockpit has sofas on both sides. The open deck running aft also . has a door that hinges . out to create a bathing platform. Boat International magazine said Adastra 'could spell the future for efficient long range cruising'.

Shiny: As the designs show, the boat has a bathing platform at the back where passengers relax as the it glides effortlessly across the open sea . The main helm station, which has seating for two, is . positioned in a raised pilot house situated between the rear deck and the saloon . area and forms part of the cross beam structure. The Adastra is the latest in a long line of super yachts that compete to be the most high tech.

"Identical twin brothers who posed as charity collectors to raise thousands of pounds for overseas Al-Qaeda fighters were jailed yesterday. Shabir and Shafiq Ali, 25, imitated legitimate fundraisers on street stalls collecting money for Palestinians and the world’s poor. But the pair were in fact wiring money to their elder brother after he travelled to Somalia to join the bloody Islamic insurgency. Identical crimes: Twins Mohammed Shafiq Ali, left, and Mohammed Shabir Ali, right, posed as charity collectors to raise money for their elder brother's terrorist training . They were caught out after counter terrorism police raided their home and discovered a digital recording of a phone conversation with him. The brothers had kept the encounter as a final memento as they expected he would soon be killed in the fierce fighting. Sentencing them at the Old Bailey to three years in prison, Mr Justice Fulford said the men sent at least £3,000 to the Horn of Africa. He said their brother was determined to sacrifice his life alongside others fighting to create an ‘Islamic Emirate of Somalia’ They were inspired by Al-Qaeda hate preacher Anwar Al-Awlaki, the mastermind behind a series of bomb attacks who was killed in a drone strike last year. The judge added: ‘Both defendants worked to help somebody who was contributing to terrorist activities in a war-torn country in Africa. ‘The court must reflect the seriousness of offences of this kind in sentences given that they were intended to support terrorism.’ The Ali brothers, dressed in different coloured suits by prison staff so they could be identified, showed no emotion as they were jailed. At an earlier hearing one lawyer was caught on a video link confessing that he could not recognise his own client. Jailed: The brothers were both jailed for three years at the Old Bailey in London . The wife of Shafiq, a former doorman who worked for Transport for London as a security guard at the time of his arrest, is expecting their first child in October. Shabir, a father of three children aged under five, was undertaking a training course to allow him to work as a teaching assistant when his activities were uncovered. The court heard the fundraising plot was led by Shabaaz Hussain, 28, who was jailed for more than five years in March after sending £9,000 to the fighters. Police searched the brother’s home in Tower Hamlets, East London, after bugging Hussain’s car and catching them discussing the conspiracy. They uncovered extremist literature, including a pamphlet by Al-Awlaki, entitled ‘44 Ways To Support Jihad.’ But it took several more months for investigators to discover a digital computer file containing the phone conversation with their brother Shamim, 29. He had flown to Somalia via Nairobi and Dubai in August 2008 to train alongside other jihadists in weapons, combat and survival. Several days later the elder sibling boasted in a telephone call about how he was prepared to die as his brothers expressed concern for his welfare in the hot and lawless land. Prosecutor Timothy Cray said: ‘He relates to them the rigours of the training camp and the dedication of the trainers, who he describes as brothers, in training them to fight,’ said Mr Cray. ‘Details of the particular fighting are given, including training using guns and automatic weapons, such as Kalashnikovs. ‘It’s clear from what their sister said that the recording was made by the family as they believed this would be the last time they would speak to their brother. ‘No doubt they wanted to have a recording of a loved sibling.’ Shamim, who left Britain with two other men, has not been heard from since and the return parts of the trio’s air tickets have never been used. The twins were also caught discussing a figure they referred to as ‘Brother Hamza’, who gave them detailed instructions on raising cash. They posed as collectors for Muslim Aid, a huge charity that works to help the world’s poor, and supporters of Palestinian causes. However the money was channelled to their brother in Somalia via wire transfers that were authenticated with mobile phone numbers, although some was stolen. Mr Cray said: ‘The Crown’s case against these defendants is that terrorist training abroad depends on a network of supporters - and these defendants were part of that network.’ Barristers for the brothers said their elder sibling was mentally ill and they care for their mother who suffers from depression and schizophrenia. They claimed the pair had been driven by concern for their brother and did not intend for the money to fall in to terrorist hands.","Shabir and Shafiq Ali, 25, imitated .

"Tom Greatrex said football fans needed protection from owners looking to cash in on stadiums . Football fans should get a veto before millionaire owners sell off their club's ground and move to cheaper out-of-town stadiums, MPs said today. The government was urged to introduce a statutory consultation with fans on any proposed change of use in football grounds to protect clubs and stadiums from 'asset stripping'. It came after minister were also urged to ban live Premiership games on Remembrance Sunday out of respect for the fallen. Labour MP Tom Greatrex, a Fulham fan, said football fans needed protecting from out-of-touch owners looking to cash in on stadiums situated in expensive areas. He said some grounds will prove more profitable if they are used for something other than football and so some fans are uncertain about their clubs remaining in their original community. Sport Minister Helen Grant said the Government's expert working group on football supporter ownership and engagement has been set up to deal with issues like this. Mr Greatrex, MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, asked Ms Grant: 'There are clubs whose grounds are potentially worth more for other purposes than football and there is uncertainty about clubs maintaining their links with communities. 'Fortunately, in relation to Fulham, despite misguided property speculators and ill-advised owners in the past, we have managed to survive at Craven Cottage, which is an iconic football ground and part of the English football fabric. 'But are you aware of the concerns that people have and fans have and therefore do you think it's a good idea for there to be statutory consultation on ensuring that any change of use of football grounds is done with fans in mind to protect grounds from those sorts of asset stripping?' Ms Grant replied: 'You make an important point and the whole reason for the setting up of this expert group is so that fans can air their views and it will give them profile and a good platform and I'm sure issues such as this will be raised and reported to me in due course.' The Sports minister also faced calls to ban Sky Sports televising football games on Remembrance Sundays. Mr Greatrex said hit out at 'misguided property speculators and ill-advised owners in the past' who had looked to move Fulham FC away from Craven Cottage (pictured) Shadow minister Sharon Hodgson said games which fall on that date should be rescheduled in order to 'respect the original intentions of this special day'. She said this meant remembering those who had died for the country. Four top-flight games took place on Remembrance Sunday last November, with Newcastle United's trip to West Brom and Swansea versus Arsenal screened live on Sky. A minute's silence was observed at football games across the country over the weekend. Fixtures for the 2015/16 season will be announced in the summer. Shadow minister Sharon Hodgson said games which fall on that date should be rescheduled in order to 'respect the original intentions of this special day' Speaking in the Commons, Ms Hodgson told Ms Grant: 'As we're well into the 100-year commemorations of the First World War would you reassure the House, veterans in my area as well as my local armed forces network that you will ask Sky to reconsider the scheduling of their broadcast of their matches on Remembrance Sunday, which has happened in Sunderland two years in a row, and instead schedule the games for the Saturday so as to respect the original intentions of this special day - remembering those who give their lives for our country.' Ms Grant replied: 'It is important to always remember those who sacrifice their lives for our country. I'm very happy to have a chat with you on those issues.'","Governments should introduce statutory consultation with fans on moves .

"A mother who watched her cop son gunned down in front of her, his wife and his children allegedly at the hands of two illegal immigrants has vowed not to rest until his 'worthless piece of s**t' killers are dead.' Heartbroken Marie Vega was on a family fishing trip with her husband Javier, son Javier Jr., his wife Paola and their three children when they were ambushed by two armed Mexican illegal immigrants who have been deported SIX times before in total. Javier Jr and his father bravely tried to fight them off, but the off-duty Border Patrol Agent was fatally shot in the chest and Javier Sr was blasted in the hip. Final farewell: Javier Vega Jr's wife Paola (left), mother Marie (center) and father Javier (right), stand over his casket as he was buried with full military honors on Thursday . Revenge: Marie Vega took to Facebook . to promise that she will avenge her son's death. In an emotional Facebook post she said that she wished she could have died instead of him . Pall bearers carry a casket containing the remains of Javier, 36, out of St. Francis Xavier Church in La Feria, Texas on Thursday . Mexican nationals Gustavo Tijernia, 30 and Ismael Hernandez, 40 fled the scene and were arrested hours later after a huge man hunt. The ruthless killing has again highlighted the border crisis plaguing the Obama administration which is struggling to contain a huge wave of illegal immigration across the border with Mexico which has stretched authorities to breaking point this year. On Tuesday devastated Marie posted an emotionally charged message on her Facebook page alongside a picture of her beloved son. Marie, who works as a photographer, wrote: 'My sweet sweet baby. I failed you oh sweet child of mine. I was supposed to protect you and keep you safe. I failed to save your life. I wish a million times I had died and not you. You are my life, my heart was ripped out when I lost you. I will not rest until these worthless pieces of s*** are dead.' Hundreds of law enforcement officers turned out for Javier Vega's mass, held at St. Francis Xavier Church in La Feria on Thursday. The car lot was packed with State Trooper Vehicles, local police cars and SUV's from Javier's colleagues in The Border Patrol. His devastated family, including his injured father, Javier Snr arrived in a white limousine, behind a hearse. As his coffin was carried out at the end of the ceremony, officers held up the flags of The Border Patrol, The US Marine Corp and The Stars and Stripes. Javier was a Border Patrol veteran of six years and had previously served in the U.S. Marine Corp, like his brother Jordy. On Sunday he travelled to his favorite fishing hole around 20 minutes north of La Feria with his mother, father, wife and three boys Javier Vega III, Jiovanni, and Jarod. Tijernia and Hernandez pulled up to the secluded spot in a car and tried to rob them at gun point. When Javier bravely reached for his weapon, they shot him in the chest. TheBlaze reported . that his last words were 'keep shooting, dad'. It is believed Javier . Sr then grabbed the gun and shot at the robbers, but was blasted in the . hip. He has now been released from hospital. Willacy . County Sheriff Larry Spence told TheBlaze that Marie even picked up an . AR-15 rifle and shot at the suspects' vehicle as the suspects fled. They . eventually crashed their car and took refuge in a neighbor's house. The . home owner alerted Border Patrol officers to their location and scores . of agents moved in to arrest them. They . were arraigned on Tuesday and charged with capital murder, attempted . capital murder, four counts of aggravated robbery and tampering with . evidence. Gunfight: . Javier Vega Jr. (left) was killed and his father Javier R. Vega . (center) wounded when the robbers ambushed them on a family fishing trip . last Sunday. (Pictured right is brother Jordy) Ismael Hernandez, left, and Gustavo Tijerina, right, had both been arrested and deported numerous times but came back across the border with seeming impunity. Tijerna could also face charges in connection with a string of attacks linked to the infamous Gulf Cartel . Brave: Police said Marie (pictured with husband Javier R.) even shot at the fleeing robbers with an AR-15 that she picked up in the chaos . Fox News has reported Tijernia - who is the alleged gunman - could also face charges in connection with a string of similar attacks in Cameron County over the last six weeks, believed to be linked to the infamous Gulf Cartel. The ruthless crime syndicate is one of the oldest, most established in Mexico and is based out of the suspects' home town of Matamoros, directly across the border from Brownsville, Texas. Its . primary business is drug smuggling, but it also operates through . protection rackets, assassinations, extortions and kidnappings. It is . believed it has recently branched out into robbing U.S. citizens, before . smuggling their belongings back across the border. Fox . News claims sources have informed them Tijernia is expected to be . charged with four counts of aggravated robbery and one conspiracy . organized crime charge. They . state one of Tijernia's earlier victims was another off-duty Border . Patrol agent who was also out fishing when he was robbed. The . crew would fire warning shots at fishermen, before ordering them to . hand over jewelry, cash and keys to their cars, Fox News states. On Tuesday the station also reported both Tijernia, 30 and Hernandez, 40 had been arrested and deported numerous times. According . to court records, Tijerina, who also goes by the name Tijerina-Sandoval, . pleaded guilty to entering the U.S. illegally on July 9, 2007. He was . given a 30-day sentence with credit for time served and charged a $10 . fee. Three . months later, on Oct. 4, he was again found guilty of entering the . country illegally and was sentenced to 60 days in jail and $10 fee. In a . criminal complaint, he said he entered the U.S.on Sept. 1 and was . confronted by border patrol agents near Weslaco, Texas, on Oct. 3. He . had waded across the Rio Grande River near Progreso, Mexico, court . records show. Distinction: Javier, right, and his brother Jordy, left, both served in the Marines before Javier Jr. became a Border Patrol Agent . A . year later, on Oct. 25, 2008, he again entered the U.S by crossing the . river. On Nov. 18, 2008, he was given 90 days in jail and another $10 . special assessment fee. On Dec. 15, 2009, Tijerina was indicted by a grand jury on charges of entering the U.S. illegally yet again. The . indictment says he 'had previously been denied admission, excluded, . deported and removed, knowing and unlawfully was present in the United . States having been found near Edinburg, Texas.' Court . records say he had not obtained permission from the U.S. attorney . general and the secretary of homeland security to reapply for admission . into the U.S. A warrant was issued for his arrest stating he faced up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. He was held without bond on Jan. 26, 2010 and was given nine months in jail and fined $100. Sources confirmed to Fox News that these cases involved the same Tijerina who is accused of slaying of Javier Vega. The sources also said Hernandez, the second suspect, has been deported twice for entering the U.S. illegally. These shocking revelations come at a time when the government is under intense scrutiny over its immigration policy and control of the U.S. border with Mexico. President Obama faces a growing humanitarian crisis as more than 57,000 children have arrived unaccompanied at the border. Lawmakers have expressed concern that gang members and criminals  have slipped in as authorities struggle to deal with the flood. Obama has called on Congress to quickly approve his request for $3.7 billion in emergency funding to deal with the crisis amid calls from some Republicans to deploy the National Guard at the border. Javier Vega's murder has sent shockwaves through the local community. Yesterday . Border Patrol's Chief Patrol Agent Kevin Oaks said: 'Words cannot . express our sorrow for the loss of our brother, when we lose one of our . own, it feels as if we've lost a beloved member of our own family. 'I . wish to express to his family and friends my deepest condolences. May . the peace that comes from the memories of the time you shared together, . comfort you now and in the difficult days ahead.' 'The Kingsville Station is at a loss,'said Kingsville Station Acting Patrol Agent in Charge Arnold Perez. Widow: Javier Jr. is survived by his wife Paola Vega and their three sons. The National Border Patrol Council has set up a memorial fund for them . 'Not . only did Javier strive to be the best agent and K-9 handler, but he . also made it a point to develop and truly care about his friendships.' The National Border Patrol Council has set up a memorial fund for Javier's widow and his three children.","Marie Vega watched as her son, Javier Jr., was gunned down in front of family on fishing trip in La Feria, Texas .

"Former vice president Dick Cheney has backed down from comments he made that Sarah Palin was not qualified to be a vice presidential candidate after he called her selection ‘a mistake’ by John McCain in a TV interview. Cheney said his comments were aimed at the basic process that McCain used rather than an attack on Palin, the former Alaska governor. His turn around came after a backlash to his comments on Palin’s suitability for the role in an interview on ABC News last week. Palin a 'mistake': Former vice president Dick Cheney told ABC News that he Sarah Palin was a 'mistake' to pick her as a vice presidential candidate but days later said his comments were not an attack on her . He said: ‘'I like Governor Palin. I’ve met her. I know her. 'But based on her background, she’d only . been governor for, what, two years? I don’t think she passed that test of . being ready to take over and I think that was a mistake.’ Cheney told Fox News . on Monday: 'My point basically dealt with the process in terms of that . basic requirement: Is this person prepared to step in to be President of . the United States when they’re picked? Quick to respond: Palin was quick to hit back saying Cheney was listening to 'a false narrative over the last four years' ‘I was asked if I thought the McCain . process in ‘08 had been well done or was it a mistake, and I said I . thought it was a mistake.’ Palin was quick to hit back, making reference to an incident when Cheney accidentally shot his friend while quail hunting. She said: ‘Seeing as how Dick, excuse me, Vice President Cheney, never misfires, then evidently he’s quite convinced that what he had evidently read about me by the lamestream media, having been written, what I believe is a false narrative over the last four years.’ McCain defended his decision to pick Palin saying he was 'proud of Sarah Palin'. To Palin's defence: Senior senator John McCain (right) defended his decision to pick Palin saying he was proud of her while even Cheney's daughter Liz (left) posted her disagreement with his comments on her Twitter account . Daughter's tweet: Liz Cheney came to Palin's defence, speaking out against her father's comments . Even Cheney’s daughter also came to Palin’s defence, posting on Twitter: 'Rarely do I disagree with best VP ever but @SarahPalinUSA more qualified than Obama and Biden combined. Huge respect 4 all she's done 4 GOP.' During the interview, Cheney was also quick to condemn President Barack Obama as a 'worse' president than Jimmy Carter. He said: 'I obviously am not a big fan of President Obama. I think he’s been one of our weakest presidents. 'I just fundamentally disagree with him philosophically. I’d be hard put to find any Democratic president that I’ve disagreed with more.' Condemned Obama too: During the ABC News interview, Cheney said Barack Obama was one of America's 'weakest presidents'","The former vice president says his comments about Palin were aimed at John McCain's selection process rather than an attack on her .

"An Egyptian man has sliced off both his hands by placing them in the path of a speeding train to overcome his stealing addiction. Ali Afifi, 28, was apparently so appalled by his habitual crimes that he took his punishment into his own hands. The young man, apparently guided by the rules of Sharia law, severed both his hands in his self-inflicted purgatory. Desperate measure: Ali Afifi began stealing by taking sandwiches for friends but soon developed kleptomania - an addiction to stealing . Self-inflicted punishment: Egyptian Ali Afifi, 28, severed both his hands under a train to fight his addiction of stealing . His decision was likely to have been drawn from the Islamic teaching of Sharia law - the principles, rules and subsequent punishments that inform every element of life for those who practice Islam. Mr Afifi said his stealing 'disease' started at a young age, first taking his friend's lunches at primary school. It then escalated to items in shops and until recently he was taking people's mobile phones and gold jewellery. He said he used to give the money he made from the thefts to children and poor families. But Mr Afifi was unable to cope with the guilt and decided to cut off his hands to put an end to his compulsive behaviour. He said he wants to help his local town, improve the buildings and build a youth centre. He also wants to marry but doubts an Egyptian woman would take him because of his history of theft. The Islamic legal system deals with many issues addressed in secular law as well as informing daily decisions of a personal and mundane matter, including hygiene, fasting, prayer, diet, politics, sexual intercourse and marital rules. Interpretation of the law by Muslims varies between cultures, but it is accepted in some countries that repeated stealing is punishable by cutting off the hand. In Islamic divine law, stealing is one of the most serious crimes and punishable by amputation . The 28-year-old, from Tanta, north east Egypt, was apparently so appalled at his own crimes he punished himself guided by Sharia law . Normally, a person caught stealing would be summoned to a Sharia court where Islamic jurists would issue guidance on an issue. But . for Mr Afifi, from the central Nile delta region of Tanta, Egypt, he . decided he knew what his fate should be, according to the 'divine law'. According to Sharia law, stealing is considered one of the most serious crimes as specified by the Quran. A Sharia court may issue a punishment of some kind of injury to the hand to someone caught stealing for the first time, such as slowly driving a car wheel over the hand. In countries such as Iran, Saudi Arabia and northern Nigeria, amputation for repeated stealing is still practiced. In Egypt, however, the courts have not permitted judicial amputation for many years. Last year, however, under the new Muslim Brotherhood government, MP Adel Azzazy, from the Salafi-oriented Nour Party, proposed a bill to reintroduce amputations for certain crimes. He called for the application of 'Heraba' - extreme punishments for crimes including overt robbery, murder, forcible taking of property with a weapon and vandalising public facilities. Guilt: Ali Afifi chose to carry out his own punishment for his repeated stealing . Sharia law insists that thieves lose a hand, which prompted Afifi to take such drastic action . The penalties according to Azzazy’s bill were execution in the case of murder, or cutting one arm and one leg from opposite sides of the culprit’s body in the cases of robbery and forcible taking of property. If the taking of possessions is accompanied by murder, the penalty would be death or crucifixion, to be determined by the judge. The bill, according to the Egypt Independent, also stipulated imprisonment for intimidating citizens, and that the prison sentence will end when the felon repents. The penalties would only be imposed on adult, mentally-stable wrongdoers, who either committed the crimes or assisted in carrying them out, according to the bill. Mr Afifi, who lives in Tanta, in Egypt's northern Delta region, now has two stumps where his hands and wrists once were .","So appalled by his crimes, Ali Afifi, 28, apparently decided to punish himself .

"A blind woman has had her confidence shattered after a holiday company told her she would be unable to go on a flight because she would not be able to see the safety demonstration. Lauren Wigglesworth, 27, has been left 'absolutely gutted' by holiday company Thomson, after she and friend Stephen Sherwood, 24, were told that they would need a carer with them on the plane. The holiday company has since contacted Lauren's mother, Dawn, . 50, and said their staff will assist the two friends on the flight from . Manchester Airport to Palma, Majorca, next Wednesday. But Mrs Wigglesworth said her daughter, who was so desperate to get away on the break she canceled a planned operation, was now not confident enough to fly with them after the ordeal. U-turn: Lauren Wigglesworth, 27, and Stephen Sherwood, 24, were initially told that they couldn't fly with Thomson because they are blind . Lauren suffered mid-facial disfigurement in the womb because of . complications with her mother's pregnancy when hormones stopped being . produced. The condition, which is genetic, left Lauren blind from birth. It is so rare that it is known to affect just 23 people in the world and doesn't have a name. Thomson contacted her and said their . staff would assist the two friends on the flight from Manchester Airport . to Palma next Wednesday. But Mrs Wigglesworth said her daughter would not be taking up the offer. She said: 'She is gutted. 'And I am, as a parent. It was a huge deal for her to be travelling alone. She will not be going on holiday with Thomson. She has lost all confidence. 'She does not feel confident enough to be able to go and fly with them. 'Thomson said that they will assist . Lauren and Stephen on the plane. They got in touch and said they would . put someone on the flight with them. 'There is no reason at all why . Stephen and Lauren can't fly, the whole situation is ridiculous. He has . flown on his own before and she gets the train all round the country on . her own.' She added: 'She was so excited about it. She had an operation planned for April 24, which she canceled so she could fly afterwards. 'It could have been all out the way by now. It was her dream holiday  for her - the first time she could go away and do things she wanted to do. 'She is devastated.' Backed down: Lauren Wigglesworth, 27, who has had a . series of operations, has got her travel money ready for her holiday to Majorca . No go: Lauren Wigglesworth, 27, and Stephen Sherwood, 24, were told by Thomson it wasn't safe for them to fly because they are blind . The pair booked their £538 half-board five-night break at the the luxury C'an Picafort resort in January but were told two weeks ago that they couldn't go. Lauren was so excited about her holiday . that she had already bought all her holiday clothes, booked in to have . her hair done and got her Euros - but then was told she couldn't go. The . holiday company insisted that 'we are not able to allow them to travel . unaccompanied' but then offered the pair special assistance. However, after reading of the pair's . plight on the Mail Online, a company which specialises in holidays for . the blind has apparently offered the friends a break - for free. Mrs Wigglesworth said Traveleyes had . contacted her and invited her daughter and friend away in August, an . offer which she has accepted. Dawn told the MailOnline: 'It sounds fantastic and it means she still gets to do what she wants to do most - travel independently. ' Thomson said: 'Both Ms Wigglesworth and her friend completed a special assistance form, in which they stated they would need assistance to complete a number of safety related actions, such as putting on a lifejacket, on board the aircraft. 'These requirements are taken from the Department of Transport’s Code of Practice that has been confirmed by the UK Civil Aviation Authority, to which Thomson and every other UK airline must adhere. 'Unfortunately, as Ms Wigglesworth and her partner are not able to complete these without assistance, we were unfortunately unable to allow Ms Wigglesworth and her friend to travel alone safely on this occasion.  We understand that this must have been frustrating for her. 'With the departure dates being so close, and due to the delay in being able to inform Ms Wigglesworth she could not travel safely alone, as a gesture of goodwill we offered to organise a member of our Special Assistance Team to be present on the flight. 'Our team member would have assisted Ms Wigglesworth and her friend in the unlikely event of an emergency situation, however Ms Wigglesworth has not accepted this offer. 'Ms Wigglesworth has accepted a full refund and as a further gesture of goodwill we have offered Ms Wigglesworth the money back for the travel insurance she paid for, which she has also accepted.'","Lauren Wigglesworth and Stephen Sherwood were told they needed a carer .

"A blind jihadist pictured fighting alongside ISIS militants in Syria has reportedly urged others to join the Islamist militants, saying having a disability is no excuse. Taymullah al-Somali, a Dutch national who is believed to have travelled to the Middle East earlier this year, has been photographed numerous times alongside ISIS militants and is believed to be based in the capital of the self-declared caliphate, Raqqa. The Somalia-born militant has been quoted on known Islamist social media accounts urging Muslims to join ISIS, reportedly saying: 'Being blind didn't stop me from coming to #Syria, what's your excuse?' Scroll down for video . Militant: Numerous images of Taymullah al-Somali (centre) have emerged, including this one showing him posing alongside two men from Belgium. The man on the left is reportedly named Hicham Chaib . Ready for war: Taymullah al-Somali is seen posing with an anti-aircraft gun while dressed in combat fatigues . Numerous images of al-Somali have recently emerged, showing him posing alongside an international group of jihadists - including at least two from Belgium, one of whom is reportedly named Hicham Chaib. One image shows him posing with an anti-aircraft weapon while dressed in combat fatigues, while another chilling photograph shows him among a group of gun-toting militants holding a young child. Another shot shows al-Somali outside an apparent sharia law court in the city of Raqqa, adorned with the black jihadist flags that have become symbolic of ISIS' reign of terror in the Middle East. Al-Somali, who is often pictured smiling, has become something of a poster boy for jihadists in the Middle East, who use his disability as a rallying cry that nobody is beyond joining ISIS' ranks. Taymullah al Somali poses with an unidentified militant outside a sharia law court in the Syrian city of Raqqa. The building is adorned with the black jihadist flags symbolic of ISIS' reign of terror in the Middle East . Chilling: This photograph shows al-Somali among a group of gun-toting militants holding a young child in Syria . Background: Although al-Somali's true identity has not yet been confirmed, at least one Islamist website named him as Bashir Abu Mu'adh, who arrived in the Netherlands as a child in the early 1990s . One of those retweeting images of al-Somali is Abu Uthmaan al-Britanni, who is understood to be a 24-year-old former shop worker from Britain who travelled to Syria from the town of Portsmouth. An ISIS-affiliated social media account quoted al-Britanni praising al-Somali, saying: 'He is a wonderful friend Mujahid [fighter]. Although his eyes are blind, he is always smiling.' Images of al-Somali first emerged on an account believed to be maintained and updated by the militant himself, although it likely someone else actually posts the messages on his behalf. One photograph he shared was uploaded with the caption: 'Being blind did not stop me. What is your excuse for staying behind?'. Another post urging more jihadists to join ISIS added: 'My beloved brothers, if there is anyone with a valid excuse to reframe [sic] from jihad, it's me. I am blind!'

Earlier today Turkey's top Islamic cleric and the successor to the last Muslim caliph's most senior imam said ISIS' declaration of a caliphate 'has no legitimacy whatsoever'. Mehmet Gormez, the head of the Religious Affairs Directorate - the highest religious authority in Turkey, added that ISIS' death threats against Christians were a threat against all civilisation. 'Since the caliphate was abolished ... there have been movements that think they can pull together the Muslim . world by re-establishing a caliphate, but they have nothing to do with . reality, whether from a political or legal perspective,' he said. 'The . statement made against Christians is truly awful. Islamic scholars need . to focus on this [because] an inability to peacefully sustain other . faiths and cultures heralds the collapse of a civilisation,' he added, . Since . ISIS' advance across northern Iraq in June, Christians have fled the . city of Mosul, where the militants are based, after they were given the . choice to convert, pay a religious tax or be executed.

"Families of victims of the September 11th terrorist attacks are outraged over the proposed changes to TSA policies that will now allow small knives and large athletic equipment like lacrosse sticks of golf clubs on board commercial airplanes. 'I'm really horrified and I would say the majority of 911 family members are really shocked by it,' said Sally Regenhard, the mother of firefighter Christian Regenhard who died trying to save people in the World Trade Center. Ms Regenhard is just one of the relatives of 9/11 victims who cannot believe that the Transportation Security Administration would allow so many more items past security now after they announced just yesterday that the changes will go into effect because of a review of U.S. regulations. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: Sally Regenhard stand at a September 11 Memorial event with a picture of her firefighter son Christian. She is one of the many family members of victims who is outraged at the new TSA changes . New rules: Flight attendants are balking at the new changes that will lift a number of prohibited items and allow travelers to carry on small knives on board . Remaining restrictions: TSA officials hope that by keeping some banned it will instill less fear in flyers . The TSA said effective April 25, it . would allow small knives with blades that are 2.36 inches or less in . length and less than 1/2 inch wide. Ms Regenhard told MailOnline about a recent flight she took to Los Angeles where the security screener stopped her because she had a small container of yoghurt onto a flight. 'Yoghurt's more dangerous than a pen knife and a golf club!' she said. 'I am vehemently against anyone bringing a pen knife. I don't think there is another 9/11 family who doesn't get on a plane with a lot of trepidation and fear. 'I always think of 9/11. I always think ""Is there someone on here who is going to be here who is going to be a terrorist?""' Another relative, Debra Burlingame, says small pocketknives can be just as lethal as the box cutters that are still banned. Ms Burlingame's brother was the pilot of the hijacked plane that crashed into the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. The hijackers wielded box cutters. The families of victims are not the only ones who are upset: the former colleagues of victims are as well. Specific: The TSA says that the changes reflect the findings of their recent review of security measures . Exemptions: Only certain bats are allowed but many think it is premature to allow any at all . The Association of Professional . Flight attendants 'categorically rejects a proposal to allow knives of . any kind in the cabin,' and they don't understand why 'such a momentous . decision' was made without any consultation. As . for some of the larger items that they will now allow, like the sports . equipment, increases 'the potential for passengers getting hit with . these items during boarding and deplaning. It's a recipe for disaster,' said the APFA representative. 'This is part of an overall Risk-Based . Security approach, which allows Transportation Security officers to . better focus their efforts on finding higher-threat items such as . explosives,' he said. Travelers will now be allowed to bring . golf clubs, ski poles and even small knives on planes with them since . aviation officials have announced significant security changes. Other items that will be allowed on . board again as part of a passenger's carry-on luggage include billiard . cues, ski poles, hockey sticks and lacrosse sticks. Items that had been prohibited like razors, box cutters or knives with a fixed blade are still not allowed on board. The restrictions about liquids are . still in place as well, meaning that anything under 3-ounces must be . declared at the security checkpoint. Loosening the reins: TSA officials have changed their stance on certain banned objects which will now be allowed on planes starting on April 25 . No longer a threat? Billiard cues and lacrosse sticks will be allowed on board now . The . Flight Attendants Union Coalition, which represents nearly 90,000 flight . attendants from carriers across the country, called the decision a . 'poor and shortsighted decision' by the TSA. 'As the last line of defense in the cabin . and key aviation partners, we believe that these proposed changes will . further endanger the lives of all flight attendants and the passengers . we work so hard to keep safe and secure,' the coalition said in a . statement. TSA spokesman David Castelveter said the . decision was made to bring U.S. regulations more in line with . International Civil Aviation Organization standards and would also help . provide a better experience for travelers. Castelveter said the TSA has implemented a . number of safety measures including reinforced cockpit doors, allowing . some pilots to be armed and federal air marshals on board airplanes.

"Being woken up by your partner who has an early shift at work can be annoying if you want to keep sleeping in peace. But an alarm clock that is designed to be worn inside the ear like an earplug could mean that one day partners will finally be able to lie-in, as only the wearer will be able to hear the alarm. The concept Earlarm device will feature two noise-cancelling foam ear plugs, which each have tiny speakers that connect to a bedside clock via Bluetooth. The concept Earlarm device will feature two noise-cancelling foam ear plugs (left), which each have tiny speakers that connect to a bedside clock (right) via Bluetooth . The alarm is designed to be set using a smartphone app so that when it goes off it  sounds only in the ears of the wearer, letting their partner continue to sleep. The concept is the brainchild of Kyungmi Moon, 24, a design graduate from Seoul, South Korea. Ms Moon, a light sleeper, was inspired to design the alarm after oversleeping while wearing earplugs to muffle the sounds of a party taking place next door. Users of the device will be able to check when their alarm will ring by looking at an LCD screen on the clock device, which doubles as a charging unit for the earplugs. She hopes to put the device into production after winning a Reddot design award, but there is currently no release date or estimated price for the device. The alarm is designed to be set using a mobile phone app so that when it goes off it will sound only in the ears of the wearer, letting their partner continue to sleep in peace . Ms Moon, who developed the project with friends Doyun Kim and Jinyong Park, both of whom are 26, said: ‘I am a light sleeper and unfortunately my flat was not properly soundproofed and party animals lived next door. ‘I couldn't get to sleep easily and would wake up in the middle of night because of noise such as laughter and loud music. ‘Sometimes alarm clocks from next door would wake me up when I didn't want to get up.' Ms Moon said she was exhausted and began . to wear earplugs to block out the noise, but overslept because she . couldn’t hear her alarm and was late for class as a result. The concept alarm clock with ear plugs (pictured left) is the brainchild of Kyungmi Moon, 24, a design graduate from Seoul, South Korea. She came up with the idea when wear earplugs to sleep in her noisy flat, but was late for classes when did not hear her alarm. An illustration of a person wearing the device is pictured right . She said: ‘At that moment, the idea [for Earlarm] flashed through my mind - what if that alarm was in my ear just like the earplugs?’ Alarm clocks usually have the disadvantage of waking everyone up when they go off, which is especially annoying as many couples start work at different times, or might just fancy a lie-in. But Ms Moon said her device is ‘an alarm clock only for you’. ‘The tiny alarm clock in your ears shuts out noise just like earplugs so you can sleep soundly, and the ringing in your ear wakes you up without waking other people,’ she said. Users can check when their alarm will ring by looking at an LCD screen on the clock device, which doubles as a charging unit for the earplugs. Here, an illustration suggests how the device might fit together .","Earlarm was invented by design graduate from Seoul, South Korea to solve the problem of getting a good night's sleep while still hearing an alarm .

"Change: Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, said the benefits system has created welfare 'ghettoes' Conservative welfare reforms are part of an 'historic mission' in the tradition of the fight to end slavery, Iain Duncan Smith claimed today. The . Work and Pensions Secretary said his determination to cut benefits and . get people back to work is like the work of William Wilberforce who . campaigned for the end of the slave trade and Lord Shaftesbury, who . enacted laws to protect women and children in Victorian factories. He said middle-class families have been . shocked by the reality of the ‘twilight world’ of Britain’s welfare . ‘ghettos’. And in a clear reference to the Channel 4 documentary Benefits Street, the . Work and Pensions Secretary said that under Labour the ‘middle-class . majority were largely unaware of the true nature of life on some of our . estates’. ‘Even . now, for the most part, they remain out of sight – meaning people are . shocked if and when they are confronted with the reality,’ Mr Duncan . Smith added. Signalling further welfare reforms that . will be central to the Conservative election manifesto, he also . cautioned colleagues that ‘casual disapproval of those on benefits is . too easy’, pointing out that generations of politicians created the . system that now traps claimants. In a major speech he . said: 'Reform, often overused, is in reality about transformation and . life change, improving people’s lives through the choices they make: a . journey from dependence to independence. 'As . Conservatives, that is part of our Party’s historic mission. Just look . at Wilberforce and Shaftesbury: to put hope back where it has gone, to . give people from chaotic lives security through hard work, helping . families improve the quality of their own lives. The Conservative party must not keep 'finger-wagging' at people it disagrees with, Iain Duncan Smith said today. He . said he backed Treasury minister Nicky Morgan who this week warned the . party would not woo female voters if it only talked about what it . 'hates'. She said the party . must not just say: ‘We're against this, we're anti-that, we don't like . them, we don't want them here, we don't want them doing this.' She . added: ‘If we talk about what we hate all the time, we're not talking . about we like and what we want to do to help people who want to do well. Mr . Duncan Smith said he agreed with the remarks. He told BBC Radio 4's . World At One: 'I’m in favour of talking about what we believe will . improve life, not always finger-wagging, my point about welfare reform . is it’s positive life change. 'It's about getting people back into the mainstream, getting them back with that hope, that security.' 'Shaftesbury . and Wilberforce were people who faced a massive problem, a social . problem, and saw only the need to change it, and embarked on that change . against the vested interests and accepted wisdom of their age, and the . results you can see were massive and transformational.' Benefits . Street, the Channel 4 programme about the lives of benefit claimants on . a Birmingham street, has provoked a fierce debate about the welfare . state. Mr Duncan Smith argued that Britain ‘will only be great again if all in our society are part of our economic recovery and growth’. Yesterday, the Bank of England gave an unusual endorsement of the Government’s claim that its reforms – including a new £26,000-a-year cap on benefits paid to any one household – are encouraging people to get work. With official figures showing employment at a record 30.15million after the biggest ever quarterly increase, the Bank said: ‘A tightening in the eligibility requirements for some state benefits might also have led to an intensification of job search.’ Speaking yesterday, Mr Duncan Smith . described the jobs figures as extraordinary. ‘I believe the welfare . reforms this Government has introduced – including, like the Bank of . England mentioned, the tightening in the eligibility requirements for . some state benefits – have contributed to this positive labour market . story,’ he said. ‘The long-term economic plan and the . reforms we’ve introduced are playing an important part in helping people . off benefits and into work. In . a speech in London today to mark the tenth anniversary of the Centre . for Social Justice, the think tank he set up in opposition, Mr Duncan . Smith  insisted that the Tories ‘would have wanted to reform the welfare . state even if we had no deficit’. ‘As Conservatives, we should hate the idea of people with unfulfilled potential languishing on welfare,’ he said. ‘Welfare . reform is fundamentally about opportunity and life change, cutting the . cost of social failure by transforming the life chances and outcomes of . those on benefits – restoring fiscal stability, and restoring lives at . the same time.’ Controversial: The Channel 4 programme Benefits Street has provoked a fierce debate about the welfare state . He believes millions were left locked in a life of dependency with ‘no incentive to aspire for a better life’. In the worst cases, the current system ‘makes criminals out of those trapped in its clutches’ as people choose to work in the ‘shadow economy’ because they fear benefits being withdrawn if they do so legitimately. Under Labour, despite the economic . boom and a 60 per cent increase in welfare spending, income inequality . was the worst for a generation, Mr Duncan Smith will add. ‘In . neighbourhoods blighted by worklessness, where gangs were prevalent, . debt and drugs the norm, families broken down, those living there had . one thing in common; they were for the most part dependent on the state . for their daily needs,’ he said. ‘For too long we let these problems be . ghettoised as though they were a different country.’ Welfare 'ghettoes': Police Community Support Officers patrol along James Turner Street in Birmingham which was the focus of a Channel 4 series Benefits Street . The welfare system became ‘distorted’ and was too often an entrapment rather than the safety net it was intended to be. ‘And at its very worst, the present system makes criminals out of those trapped in its clutches,’ he said. ‘Faced with losing up to 94 pence of every pound they earn because of how benefits are withdrawn, too many end up in the shadow economy or working cash in hand. ‘Such behaviour can never be condoned, but it is a tragic state of affairs – and a mark of how far the current system has failed – that people should feel pushed into crime by having their aspirations to make a living penalised. ‘Surely the system should deliver for people who want to work hard and play by the rules.’ The star of Benefits Street rang Nick Clegg yesterday – and revealed that she was a Labour supporter. But ‘White Dee’, the self-styled ‘mum’ of the Birmingham street, pictured below, said she might be persuaded to back the Liberal Democrats. Dee – real name Deirdre Kelly – rang Mr Clegg’s radio phone-in show to ask if he thought the documentary was a ‘fair  reflection’ of people on benefits. The Deputy Prime Minister admitted he had not watched the Channel 4 series yet, but was committed to reforming welfare. After she told him she was ‘very into  politics’ and always voted, the 42-year-old told Mr Clegg: ‘The last time I voted it was Labour because I was really annoyed when you went into coalition with the Tories. 'But hey-ho, you can win me back, Mr Clegg. You can attempt to win me back.’ Miss Kelly later confirmed she had voted Labour in a local election. She goes by the name ‘White Dee’ to distinguish her from a neighbour ‘Black Dee’, whose real name is Samora Roberts. Yesterday she invited Mr Clegg, pictured below, to visit the residents of James Turner Street after calling his show Call Clegg on LBC radio. ‘He would see a very clean street,’ she said. ‘He would see people getting together, helping each other – not scrounging – and children at school. He would be very, very welcome.’ The series, set to run for another two weeks, saw 5.2million tuning in to Monday’s episode – but it has attracted more than 900 complaints after featuring scenes of shoplifting, jokes about fiddling benefits and growing cannabis. In one episode Miss Kelly is shown using her knowledge of the welfare system to help her neighbours, of which 75 per cent are said to be on benefits, to negotiate the Government’s new welfare tests. But she told The Lib Dem leader the show’s stars were ‘shocked’ by how they had been portrayed because they thought it was ‘a documentary about community spirit’. ‘I think it’s very cleverly edited’, she added. Mr Clegg told Miss Kelly that ministers had to be ‘hard headed’ over welfare but warned against ‘demonising’ those on benefits. ‘Receiving help from the generosity of others shouldn’t be a permanent way of life, and that the incentive to work is the most important one of all,’ he said.","Mr Duncan Smith: Everyone should be part of Britain's improving economy .

"Tourists have been evacuated from one of the most iconic bridges in Paris after it began to crumble under the weight of thousands of 'love locks'. A chunk of the Pont des Arts bridge fell away on Sunday night and the police were called to seal off the area which remains closed today. It is a popular custom for tourists to secure a padlock to the bridge branded with their names as a romantic gesture, with Kourtney Kardashian and boyfriend Scott Disick also indulging in the tradition. Scroll down for video . Sealing their love: Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick attached a padlock to the Pont des Arts when they visited Paris with their son Mason . No crossing: A wooden board covers a section of the bridge railing that collapsed under the weight of the padlocks . Dangerous: Police said it was lucky the rail collapsed inwards rather than out into the river below, which is often busy with tourist boats . Kim Kardashian has also been pictured attaching a lock to the bridge when she visited Paris while pregnant. But the weight of the locks is damaging . the metal Ponts des Arts, which was originally completed in 1804 but rebuilt in . the 1980s following damage in the two World Wars. A local French police spokesperson said: 'A metal grille had fallen inwards, rather than into the river. 'If it had landed on a passing boat, the results could have been disastrous. As it happened, nobody was injured. 'The bridge was evacuated, and will now be closed until Monday morning at the earliest.' Celebrity trend: Kourtney, pictured with Scott and son Mason, was captured on camera attaching the lock for TV show Keeping up with the Kardashians . In the family: Kim Kardashian and her mother Kris Jenner also stopped at Pont des Arts on a visit to Paris to attach a padlock to the bridge . Vying for space: There are now so many padlocks on the bridge that some tourists have taken to attaching theirs to lampposts too . If follows growing calls for the padlocks - which also blight other major European cities including London - to be banned. It has become common practice for visitors to buy a padlock, attach it to a bridge, and then throw the key into the river, in Paris's case the Seine. The practice has been encouraged by American celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, who spent a lot of time dating in Paris before their wedding in Italy last month. The famous Paris bridge is said to offer some of the best views along the Seine . It was first built between 1802 and 1804, under the reign of Napoleon, and is a favourite with artists . Due to damage sustained in WW1 and WW2, the bridge was rebuilt between 1981 and 1984 . The 'love lock' tradition began in Hungary in the early 20th century, based on a tale of a woman who lost her soldier love to another during WW1. Young women started symbolising their love by attaching padlocks to the bridge where the abandoned woman used to meet her lost lover. The padlock tradition took hold in Western Europe in the early 2000s and was popularised by an Italian book I Want You by Federico Moccia, in which a couple adds a padlock to the Ponte Milvio in Rome. In Paris, the ritual began in 2008 on the Pont des Arts but has since extended to the Pont de l’Archevêché near Notre Dame too. Othe bridges encountering problems from a vast quantity of padlocks being affixed are the Ponte Vecchio in Florence and the Ponte l’Accademia in Venice. A . 'Not Love Locks' campaign was launched in Paris by two Americans in . February, in response to some 700,000 padlocks appearing around the . city. All . bridges have been blighted by the practice, but the Pont des Arts now . looks like two solid walls of metal divided by a wooden walkway. 'It's so out of control,' says Lisa Anselmo, who co-founded the campaign with fellow writer Lisa Taylor Huff. 'People . are climbing up lampposts to clip locks on, hanging over the bridge to . put them on the other side of the rail, risking their lives to attach . one. It's a kind of mania. It's not about romance any more - it's just . about saying 'I did it.' On tour: Actor Leonardo DiCaprio has also visited the iconic Ponts des Arts with friends . Protests: A campaign has been started to stop the practice of fixing locks to the bridge - a problem that blights iconic bridges across Europe . Anne . Hidalgo, the Socialist mayor of Paris, has so far resisted calls to take . action over the vandalism, but the bridge collapse could change that. A . spokesman for the City Hall said: 'If the tradition continues to grow . in popularity and causes too much damage to the city's monuments, . solutions will be considered in a bid to address the problem.' The pedestrian Pont des Arts, which . links the Louvre Museum and the Institut de France, is an exact replica . of one designed by Napoleon Bonaparte's architects in 1802. Love locks: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West also attached a padlock to the bridge when they were in Paris . Lookout point: The bridge is famed for its spectacular views along the Seine . The original was damaged by German bombs during both world wars, but a faithful reproduction was built during the 1980s. It was once considered a hugely romantic bridge, enjoying arguably the prettiest views in the city, but many locals argue the padlocks have turned it into a tourist trap.","Police said it was lucky nobody was injured by the bridge section that fell .

"An annual survey that measures Americans' sense of well-being has revealed that North Dakota and not longtime frontrunner Hawaii is the state with the most contented people.The Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index showed that in 2013, North Dakota scored highest, followed closely by its southern neighbor South Dakota.Hawaii trailed the Upper Midwestern states in eighth place, while for the fifth year in a row West Virginia and Kentucky had the two lowest scores. The art of happiness: The northern green states are in the top quintile for well-being, while the states in red are at the bottom . The poll is based on six sub-indexes: life evaluation, emotional health, work environment, physical health, healthy behaviors and basic access (to services such as healthcare). North Dakota ranked only 19th in the last poll, and South Dakota came in 12th. So how did the Dakotas move so far up in the rankings in just one year? According to Gallup, North Dakota also ranked top in two sub-indexes: work environment and physical health. What a difference a year makes: Some states made remarkable progress from 2012 to 2013, but the bottom three remained the same . North Dakota has experienced a boom in the job sector and topped all other states in employee perceptions of job creation at their workplace, according to Gallup's Job Creation Index. South Dakota ranked third for job creation. The happiness index is based on more than 178,000 interviews of American adults in all 50 states between January and December 2013.

Kentucky and West Virgina, ranked 49th and 50th respectively, have scored bottom for the past five years. People in those states reported poorer physical health and lower incomes. According to Gallup, characteristics that are a common feature of highly ranked states are people who learn new and interesting things daily, who have safe places to exercise and who have fulfilling jobs with growth prospects.","North Dakota ranked top for well-being in the U.S., pushing out Hawaii which was top for the past five years .

"Viewers have been shocked by Channel 4’s Benefits Street, portraying the lives of welfare-dependent residents on a road  in Birmingham. Turn back the clock 100 years or so, and the newly built James Turner Street was a very different place, full of poor but hard-working families living in cramped conditions. But as this 1915 picture shows, a spirit of community prevailed.

"Trauma: The teenager was targeted while she was 'vulnerable' from being separated from her friends (picture posed by model) An Afghan man who fled from the Taliban to begin a new life in Australia will spend the next 14 years behind bars after a judge rejected his claim that cultural differences had led to him raping a woman. Esmatullah Sharifi, 30, was told by Judge Mark Dean in Melbourne that his background as a traumatised Muslim refugee was no excuse for the rape of a drunken and vulnerable teenager. The judge noted that a psychologist had told the Victoria County Court in Melbourne that Sharifi, who arrived in Australia in 2001, had an 'unclear concept of what constitutes consent in sexual relationships'. Rejecting that argument, the judge said Sharifi's background and flight from the Taliban was not an excuse for violence, telling the Afghan: 'You well knew the victim was not consenting to the act of sexual penetration you performed.' It was not the first time that Sharifi had appeared in court on a rape charge - in 2009 he was jailed for a minimum of seven years for the abduction and sexual assault of a woman on Christmas Eve, 2008 - five days after he had raped the teenager. Already serving seven years imprisonment for that offence, he was now charged with raping the 18-year-old who he had found alone, intoxicated and sitting on the pavement near a nightclub after she had had a disagreement with her friends. Sharifi, the judge said, had driven from his home that night in December looking for a victim. Sentence: A judge at Victoria County Court in Melbourne Australia, pictured, said it was no excuse that Esmatullah Sharifi was traumatised because he had fled the Taliban . Attack: The Afghan refugee raped the drunk teenager after picking her up outside a nightclub in Melbourne, pictured, and driving her to a dark street . He sat down beside the teenager, began talking to her and offered to drive her to a hotel where her friends had moved on to. But . when he drove off in a different direction, the young woman became . concerned and texted her friends - until Sharifi took her phone and . drove to a dark street. The . teenager cried and asked if he planned to kill her. He replied by . putting his hand around her neck and forcing her to remove her clothes . before raping her. 'Your offending is of the utmost seriousness,' said Judge Dean. Afghan women on the streets of Kabul. The rapist from Afghanistan said 'cultural differences' contributed to his sex attack . 'You . preyed upon a young vulnerable stranger who was alone and intoxicated . at night. Your brutal conduct must be denounced by this court.'

"So here he is everyone - Mr Denmark beat 45 other hot hopefuls - including the UK's Mr England, Mr Wales and Mr Northern Ireland - to win the coveted Mister World 2014 prize. The final was held on Sunday at the Riviera . International Conference Centre in Torquay, Devon. The world's most desirable man' is super-ripped carpenter Nicklas . Pedersen, 23  from from Brondby in Copenhagen. Scroll down for video . (L-R) Mr Mexico, Mr Denmark and Mr Nigeria, just after Nicklas was announced the winner . Sadly though none of us have much of a chance with the winning fella as he has revealed to MailOnline that he is in a serious long-term relationship. Nicklas says he has always been in shape but admits he had to work extremely hard to achieve his impressive physique for the competition. 'I've always been active. I love to play football, swim and hit the gym,' he says. But in the run-up to the competition he had to see a personal trainer every single day stick to a strict diet of protein and vegetables only.  'No sweets, no chocolate, no ice cream. It was really hard.' he admits. Nicklas, who describes himself as 'the . happiest guy in the world', confessed that during his intense four-month . prep he missed his favourite sweet treats. Now that his jaw-dropping abs are no longer under intense scrutiny, he says he is looking forward to indulging in marzipan and nougat ice cream. 'After . I won on Sunday night when it was all over, I needed to have some dirty . food. I saw one of the Miss England girls eating Dairy Milk and I had . to have some!' Nicklas had to work extremely hard to achieve his impressive physique for the competition . 'It was very overwhelming and is slowly starting to seem real,' Nicklas tells MailOnline. 'It feels amazing. I hoped to make it to the top ten but never in my wildest dreams did I think I would actually win. To be named Mr World 2014 is ridiculous. A dream come true.' Nicklas entered the contest one random day when he was off from work. 'I hadn't heard of the competition before. I went on Facebook and saw something on Mr and Miss Australia. I thought, ""Who are the Danish equivalents?"". So I went on the website and applied myself. 'They came back to me after more than a year and said Denmark hasn't been awarded a spot in the 2013 contest. 'But then when Denmark was awarded for 2014, they asked if I was still interested. I went for interviews and beat 100 other Danish guys to become Mr Denmark 2014.' The final of the event was broadcast on YouTube and saw Nicklas take the top prize . 'This has been the greatest experience of my life, it's been like a rollercoaster ride' Nicklas has now won prize of $50,000 USD (just short of £30,000), but he says he has no idea what he's going to do with it just yet, as his priorities right now are travelling the world and philanthropy. 'It means more to me than buying fancy things with money. I'll be doing a lot of public appearances and taking part in humanitarian missions and charity work. I'd love to go to Haiti where I can use my carpentry skills to help rebuild some of the damage even just for a couple of days or a week. That would be a dream come true.' Work aside, Nicklas is hoping to go on a lads' holiday to Malta with new friend Mr England, Jordan Williams, where Mr Malta, Bjorn Demicoli, can show them around. 'I met some great contestants. I'm like brothers now with some of the other boys, like Jordan. We'll be keeping in touch,' he says. So what is it about him that impressed so much? Mr Denmark says it was just him being himself. 'I consider myself the happiest person on the planet,' he says. 'I've always been told I have a really good attitude, and every day is a gift in my mind. I'm also a bit loud, but they must liked it! 'This has been the greatest experience of my life, it's been like a rollercoaster ride. They don't give you too much information and keep you on your toes, wondering how you're doing. 'When you don't get picked to give interviews you feel like you're behind or not good enough. And the physical aspect is tough.' Mr Denmark beat 45 other hot hopefuls to win the coveted Mister World 2014 prize . England's Jordan Williams, 26 . Northern Ireland's Dwayne Andrew Kerr, 21 . Wales's Michael-Rae Formston, 27 . Contenders had to pass and impress during various rounds including Sports Challenge, Talent Award, Fashion & Style, Multii-Media and most recently Extreme Challenge. Each round earns points which are added to the interview round, and along with stage presence marks, all points are added together to realise a winner. Finalists spent the day working with the UK Royal Marine Commandos taking on one of the world's toughest roles for their Extreme Challenge. They were put through their paces by top commando instructors, undergoing a series of extreme challenges designed to test the physical strength and mental determination needed to be a true champion. The best took on the assault course used by all Marine Commandos during training, and the best of the best took on the infamous Mudflats course to find the last man standing. Marshal Richie and his team at the Royal Yachting Association judged the Sailing round . Nicklas spent the day with UK Royal Marine Commandos taking on one of the world's toughest roles . 'The Extreme Challenge was the hardest day of my . life. I was pushed beyond my limits and actually threw up,' says Nicklas. 'It's not all about having big muscles, it's about determination, strength and mental power. They really put you to the test.' Each round was judged by carefully selected experts in the field, such as Marshal Richie and his team at the Royal Yachting Association for the sailing round. Interviews were judged by Mr World 2013 Francisco Escobar, two previous holders of the Miss World title, a musical director, stage director, choreographer and a stylist. The final of the event, sponsored and run by the Miss World Organisation, was broadcast on YouTube and saw Nicklas take the top prize.

"Jailed: Anjum Tahir was jailed for two years after admitting a sexual assault on a 22-year-old woman in Manchester . A man delivering leaflets advertising a pizza takeaway has been jailed for two years and faces deportation after he admitted following a woman into a house and sexually assaulting her. Anjum Tahir ripped off his 22-year-old victim's top and repeatedly tried to kiss her as she attempted to fight him off. The 39-year-old offered the woman money for sex and exposed himself at the house in the Gorton area of Manchester. The attack only stopped when the terrified woman's boyfriend returned home. Tahir, an illegal overstayer of Pakistani nationality, was jailed at Manchester Crown Court and now faces deportation out of the UK. The court heard that the victim opened the door when she spotted Tahir outside. When she opened the door, Tahir said: 'You're beautiful you are'. The woman said 'thanks', and turned her back on Tahir to return to the house, but he followed her inside, closed the door behind him and asked if she was alone. Tahir grabbed the woman around her waist and tried to pull her towards him, repeatedly trying to kiss her neck. He rammed his head against hers and tried to kiss her cleavage and lips as she tried to pull away. Tahir tore off her top, leaving her half-naked and tried to kiss her chest before exposing himself. The court was told that Tahir ignored the woman's desperate pleas for him to stop and he repeated: 'Look, I offer you pounds, I offer you five pounds.' When the woman's boyfriend returned home, she fled into a room and Tahir was greeted by her boyfriend who had no idea what had just happened. Tahir was arrested minutes after the attack as he continued his leafleting. The woman was left 'shaken and distressed' by the assault on the afternoon of June 18 last year. Philip Dobson, prosecuting, said that Tahir had originally denied the offence to police - claiming he didn't understand 'English ways of doing things' and 'misunderstood' the terrified woman's reaction. Hearing: Tahir pleaded guilty to the offence at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) and now faces deportation back to Pakistan . John Broadley, defending, said Tahir was 'anxious to return to Pakistan' and 'genuinely sorry' for what he had done. As well as his jail term, Tahir was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register. Judge Michael Leeming said: 'I'm satisfied that your continued presence in the UK is detrimental - consequently I would recommend that you should be deported. 'Sexual assault is one of those offences which varies enormously in its gravity - I take the view that this is a serious example of this sort of offence.'","Anjum Tahir was jailed for two years at Manchester Crown Court .

"Airline baggage fees from the likes of Ryanair are now so high that it can be cheaper for holidaymakers to use a specialist courier. For while Ryanair would charge £35 to put a standard 20kg suitcase in the aircraft hold on a one-way flight to Malaga, the courier firm SendmyBag would do it for £6 less. This means that a family of four could save £48 by sending their luggage by a courier to their holiday destination and back rather than taking it on a plane. Costly: Travellers could save themselves hundreds of pounds by sending their luggage by courier instead of taking it on flights with them . Similarly, research by Which? found that Ryanair would charge a staggering £500 to put a set of golf clubs in the hold on a return flight to Malaga. However, the courier company ‘FetchMy’ would transport the same set of clubs door to door for £140 – a saving of £360. Which? said Ryanair is not alone in imposing punishing fees for carrying large items of holiday luggage. Airlines can charge hefty fees when passengers go over their luggage allowance. Which? has found using courier services is often a cheaper alternative . A Which? spokesman said: ‘It's surprising that it can work out hundreds of pounds cheaper to get sports gear chauffeured to your destination rather than putting it in the hold. ‘It's worth checking out the prices of couriers before booking your plane tickets but it will require a bit more forward planning as most couriers need to pick up bags a few days before departure.’ It is estimated that airlines around the world make approximately £23billion every single year from 'upsells' and additional fees such for extra luggage allowance. The increasing cost of taking luggage on planes has led to a soar in the use of couriers. Sendmybag.com has seen the amount of luggage it is transported increase by 400 per cent on last year's figures and now delivers to 50 countries around the world. The ever increasing cost of extra or overweight luggage at airline check-ins has long been a bone of contention for consumers. Former Westlife star Brian McFadden refused to board his Ryanair flight when the airline said he would have to pay an extra £80 to fly his golf bag from Liverpool to Spain. The singer then berated the Irish airline on Twitter for 'stealing from your own people!' He instead caught a train to London where he got on a different flight.","It is £6 cheaper to send luggage to Malaga with courier firm SendmyBag than taking it on a Ryanair flight .

"A killer who mimicked a torture scene from the notorious horror film Saw by chopping through his victim's spine was jailed for at least 30 years today. Matthew Tinling, 25, knifed former soldier neighbour Richard Hamilton 17 times in the head, neck and legs in a 'savage and prolonged' murder. At the climax of the frenzied attack, he aped a brutal moment from the famed horror franchise by trying to sever the 45-year-old's spinal cord. Tinling tortured Mr Hamilton to get him to hand over the PIN for his bank account and later withdrew £240 to spend on crack cocaine. Brutal: Murderer Matthew Tinling (left) exacted terrible torture on Richard Hamilton (right), recreating a scene from a Saw VI by hacking through his spine . Detectives were able to pinpoint the time of the killing using CCTV footage showing Mr Hamilton's curtains twitching in the early hours of the morning. Tinling denied murder but was convicted after an Old Bailey trial. Judge Timothy Pontius jailed him for life with a minimum term of 30 years for the 'savage and obviously prolonged' killing. Terrifying: Tinling was inspired by the grisly 2009 hit film Saw VI, starring Shawnee Smith (pictured) He said: 'You inflicted 17 wounds during the attack, the most serious of which was delivered specifically with the intention of severing the spinal cord, thus to cause paralysis and death, exactly as you had seen on a DVD. 'Whether or not that was Saw 6, found by the police in your room, or another in the series doesn't matter. 'Plainly it was something you had seen and tried to imitate.' Tinling was brought to court in handcuffs after attacking a prison officer while on remand following his conviction. He showed no emotion as the sentence was passed. The killer targeted his victim at the homeless hostel in Shirland Road, Maida Vale, west London, where the pair lived. Mr Hamilton is believed to have been killed at around 2am on March 28 last year. He had not been seen for weeks before his dead body was discovered. Mr Hamilton was known to have more money than the other residents because he received £197 disability allowance every fortnight on top of £272 in other benefits. 'That was to be his ultimate downfall,' said prosecutor Zoe Johnson QC. Controversial: The Saw series has been incredibly successful but its ultra-violent scenes have been widely criticised . After forcing Mr Hamilton to reveal his PIN, Tinling used it to withdraw £240 from the victim's account on April 8. The next day another resident went into Mr Hamilton's room and found his decomposing body lying next to the heavy curtains. He had been stabbed 21 times to the head, neck and legs, including a fatal injury to the jugular vein. Trial: The Old Bailey heard how Hamilton had not been seen for weeks before his dead body was discovered in Maida Vale . Mr Hamilton's bank and Post Office account cards were not recovered but Tinling's DNA was recovered from the plastic wallet used to store them. Tinling denied involvement but was linked to the scene by his DNA on the bedroom curtains and on a credit card holder. The same camera that caught the twitching curtains also captured Tinling leaving the building to dump several plastic bags in bins. Patrick Upward QC, defending, said: 'What you must remember is the circumstances in which these unfortunate men lived together. 'They were driven by the need for drugs and some times the use and abuse of alcohol. 'That can lead to fiery temperaments reacting a way which can lead to awful tragedy.'","Matthew Tinling murdered Richard Hamilton by stabbing him 17 times .

"This is the heart-stopping moment a paddle-boarder was forced to race frantically back to shore after an enormous whale and her calf began following her in the ocean. The unknown woman was paddling at Hout Beach in Cape Town, South Africa, when the majestic creatures emerged behind her. The curious woman began to paddle towards the whales to get a closer look. But the protective mother suddenly plunged underwater and re-appeared just metres away from the woman's board, with the calf in tow. Scroll down for video . This is the heart-stopping moment that a paddle boarder was forced to race back to shore after an enormous whale and her calf surfaced in the ocean behind her . The unknown woman was paddling at Hout Beach in Cape Town, South Africa, and started moving closer to get a better look . But the pair suddenly dove under the surfer and emerged next to her board, forcing her to paddle frantically back to shore . The giant mammals then followed the terrified woman for nearly ten minutes, until they were in touching distance of her board. Luckily, the whales abruptly decided to turn around and head back out to sea, leaving the woman shaken but unharmed. John Gerrets, a 53-year-old warrant officer in the Dutch army, watched the drama unfold and said it could have been particularly dangerous because of the mother's protective nature over her calf. He said: 'The woman was on her board when she saw the whale in the distance. She went further away from the beach in the direction where she saw the whale and its calf. The protective mother and her calf followed the boarder as she desperately tried to paddle back to shore . Luckily, the whales abruptly turned around and headed back out to sea leaving the woman shaken but not harmed . 'All of a sudden, the whale and her calf went under and emerged very close to the lady. The whale kept on coming closer and closer. 'I was afraid that she was about to attack her because there was a calf by her side.' He added: 'The whales were following the paddle boarder for five to ten minutes. 'She could have killed the paddler with her body or tail. It was very scary to see.'","Whales emerged while woman was paddling at Hout Beach in Cape Town .

"Tragic toddler: Brayden King, 22 months old, was found submerged in a tank of baptismal water in Alabama . A toddler died of accidental drowning after falling into in a tank of baptismal water in an Alabama church just two months shy of his second birthday. Brayden King was under the supervision of his 13-year-old sister when he fell into the large rectangular font last Friday at the Pentecostal House of Prayer in Decatur, about 75 miles north of Birmingham, said Morgan County Coroner Jeffrey Chunn. The little boy was found submerged in 33 inches of water and pronounced dead after unsuccessful attempts to revive him. The child's mother, Kimberly King, who has two teenage daughters, had prayed to God for years for a son, the Huntsville Times newspaper quoted church pastor Bishop TD Strong as saying over the weekend. ‘Twenty-two months ago he gave her a son,’ Strong said, according to the newspaper. ‘And 22 months later he was taken away. I've been preaching 30 years and pastoring for 20 years, this is the first time in my ministry I've been speechless.’ Pastor Strong described the boy’s family as ‘devastated.’ The freak accident happened around 7.45pm Friday while Brayden was at the church with his older sister and mother. Strong said Kimberly King was preparing for a skit to be performed at a prayer meeting, and the sister was tasked with keeping an eye on the toddler. House of God: Tragedy struck last Friday at Pentecostal House of Prayer - a congregation of 300 in Decatur, Alabama . Parent's worst nightmare: Brayden's mother left him in the care of his 13-year-old sister while she attended a prayer meeting, but the teen lost track of her brother for a short time . The teen lost track of the toddler for a short time. Little Brayden somehow climbed up two flights of stairs and opened a set of doors to reach the  font behind the altar still filled with water from a Sunday baptism, Decatur Daily reported. When Mrs King realized her son was not with his sister, she went on a frantic search of the church building, which eventually led her to the baptism tank where her son was discovered unresponsive. Church members and emergency crews who were called to the scene were unable to resuscitate the child. Her miracle baby: A local pastor said Kimberly King, Brayden's mother, had prayed for a son for several years . ‘I'm just at a loss, because it is so close to home,’ Strong said. ‘People die every day. And I've done many funerals, but for a child to die in church, in the baptistery, it's beyond ordinary and something that will never be forgotten by me.’ A funeral for the little boy will be held Thursday at Westside M.B. Church, after which he will be laid to rest in Rather Family Cemetery.","Brayden King, 22 months old, was found submerged in 33 inches of water at Pentecostal House of Prayer in Decatur, Alabama .

"Philadelphia is suing the Church of Scientology after the religious organisation left a 15-storey construction in the city empty for six years. The church bought the Cunningham Piano skyscraper in 2007 using millions in donations from its members under the premise of building a cathedral. However, despite high-flying plans of building a chapel, a bookstore and even an office for its deceased leader, L. Ron Hubbard, the windows of the Scientology building remain boarded up. Dead project: The Church of Scientology bought the 15-story Cunningham Piano building in downtown Philadelphia for $7.85million in 2007, but nothing has been done since . The Cunningham Piano building was purchased by the church for $7.85million, all of which had been donated by Scientologists. Now, after six years of little to no progress apart from the plywood covering doors and windows, the city has had enough. Philadelphia's Department of Licenses & Inspections is taking the church to court, which could result in daily fines of several hundred dollars. A spokesperson for the department told Philadelphia Daily News the Church of Scientology lack construction permits, and have been violating the city’s ‘doors-and-windows’ ordinance for nearly a year. Forcing progress: The building, seen at the centre of the image, has remained boarded up for six years and the city of Philadelphia is now taking the church to court . Should the Department of Licenses & Inspections be successful in their court order, the Church of Scientology could be liable for $300-per-day fines for each boarded up window and door. On its website the religious organisation describes the building which they renamed ‘The Freedom Org’ as ‘a shining example of the religion that can and does secure Total Freedom for all’. The latest update on the project came two years ago when the Church of Scientology told local papers they were planning on starting renovations in 2012, to open in spring 2013. ‘I don't understand what's going on there,’ president of the Center City District Paul Levy told the Philadelphia Daily News this week. ‘It's obviously a free country, and they bought the building, but here we are six years later, and they've done nothing. It's not only not contributing to the street and acting to the detriment to the city, it's also not a tax revenue.’ Slow process: The Church of Scientology recently opened the impressive Flag Building in Clearwater, Florida after 15 years of construction work costing $145million . This is not the first time the controversial church, whose members include Tom Cruise and John Travolta, have purchased land and property and struggled to finish their project. IN 2006, Scientology bought a 50,800 sq. ft. building in Pasadena which sat empty until renovations began in 2010. Only last month, thousands of Scientologists gathered in Clearwater, Florida for the opening of the $145million 'cathedral' which had been in construction for nearly 15 years. The group broke ground on the Mediterranean Revival-style  Flag Building in 1998, but stopped work after finishing the shell. For three years, the group ceased construction on the project until the city started imposing $250-a-day fines for code violations. Scientology defectors have explained that the building's slow construction is due to church leaders, who have allegedly used the project as a fundraising cash cow. An analysis by the Tampa Bay Times discovered that the church had raised $145million for the building, much higher than the $100million it was estimated to cost.","The 15-storey Cunningham Piano building has been empty for six years .

"Teenage pregnancy rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1960s. Figures released yesterday showed that conceptions among under-18s dropped by 10 per cent in 2012. But teenage abortion rates have risen sharply in the past decade, the Office for National Statistics revealed. The under-18 conception rate fell in 2012 to 27.9 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 17 . Under-18 conception rate by local council . Reasons . for the sudden decrease in pregnancies include more girls staying in . further education and the growing ‘stigma’ of teenage motherhood, . officials said. The conception rate for women aged 40 and over has more than doubled since 1990, while the number of women in this age group conceiving has risen from 12,032 in 1990 to almost 29,000 in 2011 and 2012. For women aged 40 and over, the percentage of conceptions leading to abortion fell from 43 per cent in 1990 to 28 per cent in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The ONS said: ‘Reasons for an increased number of women conceiving at ages 30 and above include increased participation in higher education, increased female participation in the labour force, the increasing importance of a career, the rising opportunity costs of childbearing, labour market uncertainty, housing factors and instability of partnerships.’ Independent . experts also cited the fall in the popularity of drinking, drugs and . smoking and pointed out that many youngsters spend time alone on the . internet, instead of mixing with others on the streets. The . sudden fall in teenage pregnancies came two years after the Coalition . stopped millions being poured into distributing condoms and employing . sex advisers for teenagers, through Labour’s £250million Teenage . Pregnancy Strategy (TPS). The rate has dropped by 25 per cent since 2009 . – the last full year of the TPS. Professor . David Paton, of Nottingham University, said: ‘These figures demonstrate . that it is not the provision of contraception which is having an . effect. During the years of big spending, there was very little change . in teenage pregnancy rates.’ The . ONS report said the figures could be due to ‘a shift in aspirations of . young women towards education and the perception of stigma associated . with being a teenage mother’. Early motherhood can be ‘associated with . poor educational achievement, poor physical and mental health, social . isolation, poverty and related factors’, it added. There . were 27,834 pregnancies among under-18s in England and Wales in 2012 – . down by around 10 per cent from the 31,051 in 2011. It is the lowest . under-18 pregnancy rate since 1969. In 2012, there were an estimated 884,748 conceptions in women of all ages, compared with 909,109 in 2011, a decrease of 2.7 per cent . The . TPS failed to make any serious dent in the figures in the nine years . after it was launched by Tony Blair in 1999 – and in two of those years . conception rates actually went up. As well as the provision of condoms . and advisers to teach teenagers how to use them, the scheme gave advice . on abortions – which have risen sharply over the past decade, according . to the ONS. Its report said . almost half of under-18 pregnancies end in abortion – compared to two . in five in 1992 – and six out of ten pregnant under-16s have a . termination. But older women . are increasingly unlikely to abort a baby. The termination rate across . all ages fell from 22.5 per cent in 2002 to 20.8 per cent in 2012. After . the Coalition abolished the TPS its ex-head, Alison Hadley, said in . 2011: ‘I could well predict that over the next year or so the rates will . stall or start increasing.’ But yesterday’s figures show that instead . teenage pregnancies fell at an unprecedented rate.","Under-18 conception rate fell in 2012 to 27.9% per 1,000 15-17-year-olds .

"A company boss whose PR firm who has represented the Dalai Lama launched a Willy Wonka-style audition to give his business away so he could stay home to look at his children. Simon Cohen, 35, said that when his wife, Kate, became pregnant with their second child, he wanted to leave his job to be with his wife and children. It meant he was left with the difficult decision of what to do with the company he founded 11 years ago, Global Tolerance. Simon Cohen, 35, pictured with his wife, Kate, and daughter Seren, has given away his business . He feared that selling it or merging it with another PR firm could 'disregard' the 'vision and values' of the business. And so he held a rigorous two-month process to find a successor to take over the £1m company that has clients including the Dalai Lama, Princes Charles and the United Nations. He will hand over 95 per cent of the company, with £10,000, and 11 years' worth of business contacts. After a thorough five-stage process, he chose Noa Gafni, a World Economic Forum employee and Rosie Warin, a PR director from Forster Communications. After a rigorous five-stage process, Rosie Warin (left) and Noa Gafni (right) were chosen to head the company . Simon Cohen has handed over 95 per cent of the company, with £10,000, and 11 years' worth of business contacts to Rosie Warin (left) and Noa Gafni (right) Mr Cohen, who moved to Cornwall from Brighton six months ago, told the MailOnline: 'I am delighted with the decision that has been made. It has been a surreal and scary process and it has been a bit weird. 'But Rosie and Noa have really reinforced my confidence and commitment that the right decision has been made. They have got that sparkle in their eyes and the determination to make it work and move the business forward for the next decade and beyond. 'Through Global Tolerance, I’ve been able to work with people like the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu. I’ve had a great ride, but it’s time to pass on the baton.' Mr Cohen, who has a 15 month old daughter called Seren and whose wife is due to give birth in November, said he was looking forward to being a 'stay at home Dad' but was also eager to visit South America. Simon Cohen left his job to spend more time with his family. His wife, Kate, is due to give birth in November . 'I am just looking forward to being a Dad that is present every day. At some point I would love to go to South America, that would be brilliant, especially the carnival in Rio. But there is still lots to do in the UK as well.' Mr Cohen, who married Kate in August 2011, will do communications consultancy work one day a week to pay the bills. He will also keep five per cent of the company's shares. He decided to give his business away because he said the vast majority of mergers and acquisitions fail. He said: 'It’s amazing to me how many companies express certain values, but when it comes to exit, those values are left at the door. In a world of discerning customers, this is a disaster for brand and customer loyalty - and the long-term value of the company. 'For entrepreneurs who believe in their company’s mission, seeing those values live on is worth more than any amount of cash.' To land the job, the two successful applicants had to go through a rigorous process. The first stage asked for a tweet about leadership and the second stage asked for an online application form. This was followed by a Skype interview, where Mr Cohen interviewed 25 separate applicants for 15 minutes each. For the fourth stage, he brought in advisers to help him whittle down the remaining candidates, before a final stage - where applicants had to set out their business plan - on a boat on the River Thames. Mr Cohen said it was important the process was thorough as he wanted it to serve as a model for others to follow. 'I wanted to make sure it was a serious search as I care passionately about it. I also want other businesses to take it seriously and so it can be a model for others who want to make sure their companies keep their values.' Mr Cohen has worked with clients such as the Dalai Lama and Prince Charles during his 11 year period as the head of PR firm, Global Tolerance .","Simon Cohen, 35, will hand over 95 per cent of his company .

No-one has lived permanently in Pyramid since 1998 and it is now a bizarre tourist attraction offering the world's most northerly Lenin monument. Frozen in time: The Soviet settlement of Pyramid is around 800 miles from the North Pole and has been abandoned since 1998 . Isolated: Pyramid (Pyramiden) was founded in 1910 by Sweden and sold to the USSR in 1927. It is named after a nearby pyramid-shaped mountain. These pictures were taken this spring by  Vladimir Prokofiev, a Russian guide . Cut-off: The guide regularly visits the one place in Pyramid where, on a good day, he might be lucky to catch a signal for his mobile from Norwegian settlements on Spitsbergen . These remarkable pictures of the . timewarp town are from Vladimir Prokofiev, 33, a Russian guide who . worked in this lonely outpost earlier this year. 'Welcome to the very end of the earth,' said Mr Prokofiev, whose amazing images capture a lost Soviet world. Alone . between trips from hardy tourists, he lives at abandoned Tulip Hotel, . and his only friend is an Arctic fox who joins him for breakfast. Two's company: Mr Prokofiev feeds his pet arctic fox Saigon who is only friend in the settlement. The creature regularly joins him for breakfast . Prepared: Mr Prokofiev's daily equipment which include an anti polar bear gun . Tour guide: Vladimir poses for a selfie in the gym mirror (left) and then makes use of some of the equipment that was left behind when everyone moved out . Clean: Vladimir's room at The Tulip is still in good condition despite the last paying guests checking out many years before . The pictures were taken this spring. 'The sun has been shining since 4-30am. Soon it will start shining 24/7,' said Mr Prokofiev. He regularly visits the one place in Pyramid where, on a good day, he might be lucky to catch a signal for his mobile from Norwegian settlements on Spitsbergen. 'There are no radio, TV, Internet in the village. However we can try to catch a signal from Norway in the so-called 'emotional spot' or 'spot of hope',' he said. 'It is marked by a pole.' It's a tricky business.  'The battery runs down before the fingers get frozen, you can never know which one will give up first - your fingers or a battery of your mobile,' he explained. He visits a disused gym in a wooden building known to the Soviets as 'London'. It housed unmarried men when the community was a thriving settlement. Blast from the past: A tourist poses with an unusual item in the music hall in the abandoned village. Yellowing sheet music still lies on the piano . Left behind: This factory looks as if it could have been abandoned a few months ago and many items, including machinery, are still in place . Empty: A local canteen located between hostel for men and hostel for women . Shoe mountain: A stack of abandoned footwear litters the scuffed floor in the gym . Derelict: An abandoned gym in the village which has been left to rust . 'The bigger house to the right was . called 'Paris', it was inhabited by single women. There is a canteen . between the two houses, probably to give a chance the unattached to . meet.' The thermometer reads minus 10C in the sun but Mr Prokofiev calls this 'optimistic' since it feels cooler with the wind chill. In a garage he finds a 22 year old Toyota, called a 'limo' by the Norwegian visitors. A . sign commemorates Yuri Gagarin's trip to space in April 1961, and while . the town was abandoned seven years after the fall of the Red flag, . everything about it has the stamp of Soviet Communism about it. Waiting for his tourists to arrive, he finds random traces of what was once a thriving Soviet town. Old film reel, snow boots, explosives devices, a 25 metre swimming pool . The . tourists like to visit the old works canteen, once open day and night, . where the food was free to hardy workers willing to work in this icy . climate. And also 'the most polar Lenin in the world'. 'The northernmost Lenin looks a bit crazy, doesn't he?' asks Mr Prokofiev. This ghost town is in fact in Norway - on Spitsbergen island in the Arctic Ocean - where Russia retains rights to occupy the icy territory. Lonely: These remarkable pictures of the timewarp town are from Vladimir Prokofiev, 33, a Russian guide who worked in this lonely outpost earlier this year . The ghost town, which once boasted 1,000 people, is reputed to maintain the world's most northern grand piano in the cultural centre. 'It used to be a Soviet paradise in the 1970s and 1980s with a nursery, a school, a sports and entertainment centre, a warm swimming pool covered with a roof made of Karelia birch,' said a report on Vesti-Yamal TV in Russia. 'Soil with special freeze-resistant grass was brought here by plane from 'the big land'. This grass still grows here.  But all the people have left. 'The last tone of coal was lifted on 31 March 1998.' This TV report accused early tourists of looting the town - 'they took away all they could carry', including library books and parquet flooring. Now, though, the buildings have been secured and lighting restored, with a view to increasing the number of tourists visiting Pyramid. A threat is polar bears.

A map showing the location of Spitsbergen Island . 'They enjoy coming into the village and checking rubbish bins,' said the TV report, stressing the guides in the village monitor their movements. The Spitsbergen Treaty of 9 February 1920 recognises fully Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago of Svalbard, but allows other signatory nations to settle in the islands of which Spitsbergen is the  largest. The main settlement  Longyearbyen is a Norwegian town, while the second-largest is Russian coal mining outpost of Barentsburg, still occupied and functioning. Pyramid - Pyramiden - was founded in 1910 by Sweden and sold to the USSR in 1927. It is named after the nearby pyramid-shaped mountain. Nowadays, it is accessible to travellers by boat or snowmobile from Longyearbyen, Svalbard's capital, some 31 miles to the south. A small number of residents do now live here in order to maintain facilities needed for tourists to visit a town literally frozen in time. Experts say it is the cold temperatures that have helped to preserve buildings that would otherwise have deteriorated in the 15 years since the Kremlin pulled the plug on this relic of Stalin's industrialisation of Russia.","Ghost town is in fact in Norway - on Spitsbergen island in the Arctic Ocean .

"China's Jade Rabbit rover vehicle drove onto the moon's surface Sunday after the first lunar soft landing in nearly four decades, a huge advance in the country's ambitious space programme. The 'Yutu', or Jade Rabbit, was deployed at 4:35 am (8.35pm GMT) on Saturday, several hours after the Chang'e-3 probe landed on the moon, said the official news agency Xinhua . It is the latest stage in China's bold space ambition to eventually have a Chinese astronaut set foot on the moon. Scroll down for video . The Chang'e-3, taken by the on-board camera of 'Yutu' (Jade Rabbit) rover on the moon . Yutu is on the lunar surface in the area of the moon known as Sinus Iridum (Bay of Rainbows) Touch down: China's first moon rover called 'Jade Rabbit' touches the lunar surface for the first time . Ma Xingrui, chief commander of China's lunar programme, declared the mission a 'complete success' after the rover and lander took photos of each other on the moon's surface late Sunday. China is the third country to complete a lunar rover mission after the United States and the then-Soviet Union - a decade after it first sent an astronaut into space. The mission is seen as a symbol of China's rising global stature and technological advancement, as well as the Communist Party's success in reversing the fortunes of the once-impoverished nation. Beijing plans to establish a permanent space station by 2020. Colour images showing the Chinese national flag on the rover were transmitted live to the Beijing Aerospace Control Center where Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulated the mission, the agency said. Descent: Footage taken by a camera on the bottom of Chang'e-3 lunar probe as it descends onto the surface of the moon . Over the moon: Staff at the Beijing Aerospace Control Center celebrate the successful landing . The potential to extract the moon's resources has been touted as a key reason behind Beijing's space programme, with the moon believed to hold uranium, titanium, and other mineral resources, as well as offering the possibility of solar power generation. 'China wants to go to the moon for geostrategic reasons and domestic legitimacy,' said China space expert Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. 'With the U.S. exploration moribund at best, that opens a window for China to be perceived as the global technology leader - though the U.S. still has more, and more advanced, assets in space.' A message from the party's Central Committee, the State Council - China's cabinet -, and the Central Military Commission branded the touchdown a 'milestone' in China's space programme, as cited by Xinhua late Sunday. The lunar probe began to carry out soft-landing on the moon at 9 pm China time on Saturday and touched down in Sinus Iridum, or the Bay of Rainbows, 11 minutes later, according to the Beijing Aerospace Control Center. During the process, the probe decelerated from 15km (nine miles) above the moon, stayed hovering at 100 yards from the lunar surface in order to use sensors to assess the landing area and avoid obstacles, and descended slowly onto the surface. Launch: The December 2 launch of the carrier rocket, the vehicle for China's first moon rover mission, blasting off after midnight in Xichang in southwest China's Sichuan province . The success makes China the third country, after the United States and the Soviet Union, to soft-land (a powered, controlled descent) on the moon. The last soft-landing was carried out by the Soviet Union in 1976. The probe's landing is the most difficult task during the mission, said Wu Weiren, the lunar program's chief designer, according to  the Xinhua news agency. 'It's still a significant technological challenge to land on another world,' said Peter Bond, consultant editor for Jane's Space Systems and Industry. 'Especially somewhere like the moon, which doesn't have an atmosphere so you can't use parachutes or anything like that. 'You have to use rocket motors for the descent and you have to make sure you go down at the right angle and the right rate of descent and you don't end up in a crater on top of a large rock.' State-run China Central Television showed a computer-generated image of the Chang'e 3 lander's path as it approached the surface of the moon, explaining that for about a 12-minute landing period it would have no contact with Earth. As it was just hundreds of metres away, the lander's camera broadcast images of the moon's surface. The Chang'e 3's solar panels, which are used to absorb sunlight to generate power, opened soon after the landing. The Chang'e 3 will set up antennae to transmit pictures back to Earth. Chang'e-3 relied on automated systems for descent, range and velocity measurements, finding the proper landing point, and free-falling.

Tension: A giant electronic screen displays the mission operation information of China's Chang'e-3 lunar probe as researchers work at the Beijing Aerospace Control Center . Chang'e-3 adopted a variable thrust engine designed and made by Chinese scientists. Its thrust power ranges from 1,500 to 7,500 newtons, according to Wu Weiren. The soft-landing was carried out 12 days after the probe blasted off on an enhanced Long March-3B carrier rocket. China's military-backed space programme has made methodical progress in a relatively short time, although it lags far behind the United States and Russia in technology and experience. China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003, becoming the third nation after Russia and the United States to achieve manned space travel independently. In 2006, it sent its first probe to the moon. China plans to open a space station around 2020 and send an astronaut to the moon after that. 'They are taking their time with getting to know about how to fly humans into space, how to build space stations ... how to explore the solar system, especially the moon and Mars,' said Peter Bond, consultant editor for Jane's Space Systems and Industry. 'They are making good strides, and I think over the next 10, 20 years they'll certainly be rivalling Russia and America in this area and maybe overtaking them in some areas.' Chang'e-3 includes a lander and a moon rover called 'Yutu' or Jade Rabbit. Yutu's tasks include surveying the moon's geological structure and surface substances and searching for natural resources. The lander will operate there for one year while the rover will be active for three months. Chang'e-3 is part of the second phase of China's lunar programme, which includes orbiting, landing and returning to the Earth. It follows the success of the Chang'e-1 and Chang'e-2 missions in 2007 and 2010. Sun Huixian, deputy engineer-in-chief in charge of the project, said: 'Compared to the last century's space race between the United States and the former Soviet Union, mankind's current return to the moon is more based on curiosity and exploration of the unknown universe.' 'China's lunar program is an important component of mankind's activities to explore peaceful use of space.' The moon is one of the most important themes in Chinese literature and ancient myths, including one about Chang'e, a lady who took her pet 'Yutu' to fly to the moon, where she became a goddess. 'Though people have discovered that the moon is bleached and desolate, it doesn't change its splendid role in Chinese traditional culture,' said Zhang Yiwu, a professor with Peking University. 'Apart from scientific exploration, the lunar probe is a response to China's traditional culture and imagination. China's lunar programme will proceed with the beautiful legends,' Zhang said.

On Monday Iran announced that successfully sent a monkey into space for a second time, part of an ambitious programme aimed at manned space flight. Iran's state TV said that the launch of the rocket dubbed Pajohesh, or Research in Farsi, was Iran's first use of liquid fuel and reached a height of 120 kilometres (72 miles). It said the monkey, named Fargam or Auspicious, was returned to earth safely. The TV showed the rocket blasting off and then showed the monkey, strapped snugly into a seat, staring at people clapping to celebrate its safe return. The report said Fargam's capsule parachuted safely to earth after detaching from the rocket in a mission that lasted 15 minutes. Iran frequently claims technological breakthroughs that are impossible to independently verify. The Islamic Republic has said it seeks to send an astronaut into space as part of an ambitious aerospace programme. 'The launch of Pajohesh is another long step getting the Islamic Republic of Iran closer to sending a man into space,' the official IRNA news agency said.

"North Korea's Kim Jong-un has piled on so much weight that he has fractured both his ankles and remains in hospital after an operation, it was reported today. The leader of the impoverished nation is estimated to have ballooned to 20 stone as a result of fine wining and dining - putting enormous pressure on his feet and legs. A source who has recently returned to the South Korean capital, Seoul, from the North said Kim, believed to be aged 31, is still in hospital under guard from his personal protection team. Scroll down for video . Propaganda: His love of rich food, combined with clocking up the miles in his frequent public walkabouts, have resulted in fractured ankles for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un . Hungry, sir? Kim Jong-un inspects a dining room at Seoul Ryu Kyong Su 105 Guards Tank Division of the Korean People's Army in North Korea . Bodyguards have been posted around the ward of the Pyongyang hospital and security remains tight, the source told Seoul's Chosun Ilbo newspaper. 'There's been a marked increase in the number of elite officials visiting the ward,' said the source, whose comments were supported by an intelligence official in Seoul who said Kim's official car did not appear to have left Pyongyang in recent weeks. Obese Kim is believed to have sprained then fractured his ankles during a gruelling tour of military bases and factories in shoes with Cuban heels to give him a little more height and a physical appearance of more authority. The 31-year-old dictator was seen limping in a clip from North Korea's Central TV .

He is pictured walking surrounded by weeping members of the Korean Children's Union . Kim Jong-un  meeting with children at a baby home and orphanage as he visits the Taesongsan General Hospital in Pyongyang. His weight has increased since he took power in the Stalinist nation . The 31-year-old North Korean leader got a taste for Swiss cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities, despite Western sanctions. 'He has become noticeably overweight since he came to power,' said the un-named intelligence official. In a clip from North Korea's Central TV, shown recently, Kim was seen limping when he visited a government establishment, but the date of he appointment was not known. There have been earlier suggestions that Kim's obesity and binge drinking have brought on gout which confined him to his residence for several days. His aides, however, were determined to turn his health problems to good advantage, the official Rodong Sinmun daily newspaper reporting that he had 'laboured on' by visiting various facilities, braving the hot summer weather. An Antonov An-2 . The North Korean military has turned its ageing fleet of Soviet-era aircraft into low-tech stealth bombers using wood and fabric. Troops have stripped the metal parts off Antonov An-2 biplanes and replaced them with wooden propellers and a cloth fuselage - similar to the early warplanes of the First World War. The lighter materials mean the aircraft, first produced in 1947 and mainly used as light transports and crop dusters, less likely to be picked up on radar. It is thought the £18,500 planes would be used as bombers should war break out with mortal enemy South Korea. North Korea' air fleet, though large, spends most of its time grounded thanks to shortages of spare parts and a crippling lack of fuel. A team of doctors from Europe reportedly went to North Korea recently, leading to suspicion that would have flown half way across the world only to treat someone in high authority .

The official Rodong Sinmun daily newspaper reported that he had 'laboured on' despite his health problems . Added to the belief that Kim was still in hospital after having operations on his ankles was the fact that he had missed a regular session of the Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang last Thursday. According to a Seoul government official who spoke to the Chosun Ilbo it was unlikely 'that a young man like Kim Jong-un would have missed the Supreme People's Assembly just because he has gout.' His absence from the assembly was followed by a rare admission by State TV which not only showed footage of him limping but also stated that he was ill. Kim Jong-un accompanied by his wife Ri Sol-Ju during a visit to a sub unit of the Korean People's Army Unit 552 . It has also been reported that a team of doctors from Europe went to North Korea recently, leading to suspicion that would have flown half way across the world only to treat someone in high authority. A political observer in Seoul said the only real way Kim was going to return to health, beat his gout, lose weight and prevent a repeat of his reported fractured ankles was to live a more simple life 'coming down closer to the level of his people.' Malnutrition is widespread in North Korea and famines often break out in the country, which is still reliant on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s.","The dictator's love for fine food and drink has taken its toll on his health .

"Strong views: Dr David Starkey attacked the notion of children studying world history, saying there should be a focus on our 'own culture' David Starkey has provoked more controversy by claiming that most of Britain is a ‘mono-culture’ and that immigrants should assimilate. The TV historian rejected claims by other academics that it is a diverse country, describing it as 'absolutely and unmitigatingly white' outside of London. His outburst comes three months after he blamed ‘black culture’ for the summer riots and claimed that parts of Enoch Powell's 'rivers of blood' speech had been right. He made his latest comments during a historians conference discussing Education Secretary Michael Gove's announcement that he wanted to put ‘our island story’ at the heart of Britain's national curriculum. Dr Starkey told the meeting that the National Curriculum should involve ‘a serious focus on your own culture’. Cambridge University historian Joya Chatterji asked him to explain what he meant, arguing that contemporary Britain was ‘rather diverse’. But Dr Starkey cut in, telling her: ‘No it’s not. Most of Britain is a mono-culture. You think London is Britain. It isn’t. ‘Where I’ve come from in Yorkshire, where I’ve come from in Westmorland [in Cumbria], where I largely live in Kent, where I holiday much in the South West, it is absolutely and unmitigatingly white. ‘You have such a series of assumptions. It is a kind of Ken Livingstone-esque view of rainbow Britain. Plans: Education Secretary Michael Gove has also called for British history to be at the heart of the National Curriculum . ‘Bits of Britain are rainbow and jolly interesting but to read out from those to everything else is profoundly misleading.’ Dr Starkey added: ‘Successful immigrants assimilate or become bi-cultural.’ Trevor Phillips, Chairman of the . Equality and Human Rights Commission, said he did not believe Dr Starkey . was racist but was saddened that he ‘feels that he must occasionally . utter nonsense that may give comfort to racists.’ Lee Jasper, Chairman of the London Race and Criminal Justice Consortium, tweeted: ‘Starkey the racist academic strikes again.’ Former prison chaplain the Reverend Pam . Smith jokingly questioned on Twitter whether Dr Starkey ‘can’t see . people who aren’t white’ given the racial diversity of many towns . outside the capital. Summer riots: In August David Starkey blamed 'black culture' for the disorder and said that parts of Enoch Powell's 'rivers of blood' speech had been right . Richard Evans, Regius Professor of . Modern History at Cambridge, criticised Mr Gove and Dr Starkey for . advocating ‘myth and memory rote-learning’ to feed children . ‘self-congratulatory narrow myths of history'. Dr Evans said school history teachers were right to reflect Britain’s multi-ethnic make up in lessons. Dr Starkey had been accused of racism . by more than 100 viewers of Newsnight in August when he claimed that . 'whites have become black'. He added: ‘A particular sort of violent, destructive, nihilistic gangster culture has become the fashion.’ But Ofcom ruled that the Newsnight . discussion had been balanced by other speakers who did not share the . outspoken historian's views.

"Chelsea Clinton and her newborn daughter Charlotte have been met with an outpouring of congratulations on social media. But not everyone was pleased at the prospect of a new Clinton entering the world. Chelsea, 34, gave birth to her daughter - Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky - just after 7pm on Friday evening in Manhattan, and yesterday shared the first family photo showing her, the baby and proud father Marc Mezvinsky, 36. The news was met with joy as the new mother, who announced the birth via Twitter, was inundated with messages, including from some political big beasts. Scroll down for video . New parents: Chelsea Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky shared this picture of their daughter Charlotte yesterday and declared themselves 'in love' New York mayor Bill de Blasio was quick off the mark with his congratulation - giving the new mother his 'welcome to parenthood' and noting the fact that the newest member of the Clinton political tribe was born in his city. The Democrats' official Twitter account also chimed in with its own congratulation, prompting other supporters to show their love by re-posting the message. New grandparents Bill and Hillary Clinton also joined the celebration, posting their own pictures of themselves cooing over the baby, and declaring themselves 'over the moon.'

Official seal of approval: The official account for the Democrats also voiced its congratulations - and prompted activists to join in . Proud grandparents: Bill and Hillary Clinton shared this photograph, and tweeted their delight at meeting their granddaughter . But the tone of some messages was very different - with one Conservative blogger posting a mocking picture implying the newborn would be buck-toothed and ugly. An account dubbed Paul Revere - a figure from the American Revolution - mockingly posted a 'first pic of Chelsea's baby'. And the New York Post newspaper joined in, using the birth as a way to attack Bill Clinton, and describing Charlotte as 'another liberal crybaby'.

One of his senior aides, Valerie Jarrett, did speak up, however, saying 'There's no greater gift than being a mom'. Bill and Hillary Clinton today made a second visit to Chelsea at the Lenox Hill hotel in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, smiling and waving to cameras as they made their way in.

"One of the world's most respected Islamic institutions has issued a fatwa against a Hollywood epic about Noah's Ark because it 'contradicts the teachings of Islam'. Russell Crowe's £75million film Noah has also been banned in three Arab countries after religious leaders complained that it depicted the Biblical figure - who is also a holy messenger in the Koran. Due to premiere later this month, the blockbuster will not show in Qatar, Bahrain or the United Arab Emirates and several other countries are expected to follow suit. Scroll down for video . Fatwa: Noah, a blockbuster starring Russell Crowe, pictured, has been banned in three Arab countries and three more could soon follow after a fatwa was issued against it by leading figures in Sunni Islam . God's messenger: Noah, said to have built an ark (pictured) which saved the human and animal worlds from a great flood, features in Christianity, Judaism and Islam, but depicting Allah's messengers is banned . Islam forbids representing holy figures in art, instead using conceptual line patterns and lettering to adorn the walls of mosques. A whole chapter of the Koran is devoted to Noah, who legend tells built an ark which saved himself, his family and many pairs of animals from a great flood. He also features prominently in the Biblical book of Genesis and is revered by Christians and Jews. The fatwa - a ruling or injunction under the laws of Islam - was made by the influential Al-Azhar institution in Egypt's capital Cairo, a centre of Sunni Islam thought which was founded in around AD970 and includes a university and a mosque. 'Al-Azhar... renews its objection to any act depicting the messengers and prophets of God and the companions of the Prophet (Mohammad), peace be upon him,' it announced in a statement. The fatwa added that the depictions 'provoke the feelings of believers... and are forbidden in Islam and a clear violation of Islamic law'. Fatwa: Cairo's al-Azhar (which includes the mosque pictured left) issued a fatwa, which is a ruling under Islamic law, saying the film starring Russell Crowe (right) as Noah was a 'clear violation' of their teachings .

'The official statement they offered in confirming this news is because ""it contradicts the teachings of Islam"",' the representative said, adding the studio expected a similar ban in Egypt, Jordan and Kuwait. Noah, whose trailer depicts Crowe wielding an axe and computer-animated geysers swamping an army of sinners hoping to board his ark, has also stoked religious controversy at home. Last year angry reactions at test screenings reportedly stoked tensions between the studio and director Darren Oronofsky. Perhaps wisely the filming took place nowhere near the Middle East, instead being carried out in New York State and in Southern Iceland. Harry Potter star Emma Watson plays the adopted daughter of the prophet, while screen legend Anthony Hopkins stars as his sagely grandfather. Jennifer Connelly will play Naameh, Noah's wife.  She won an Oscar for best supporting actress for her appearance alongside Crowe in A Beautiful Mind (2001). The title role was reportedly offered to Michael Fassbender and Christian Bale - both of whom declined. Jerry A. Johnson, president of a . conservative National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) group, said last . month he wanted to 'make sure everyone who sees this impactful film . knows this is an imaginative interpretation of Scripture, and not . literal.'

"Mitt Romney last night turned a famous Democratic slogan against President Barack Obama by telling his opponent that Americans would not be diverted by peripheral issues this November: ‘It’s still the economy… and we’re not stupid.’ The warning to Obama was a deft re-working of Bill Clinton’s 1992 dictum, coined by his campaign chief James Carville and hammered home at every opportunity in that election: ‘It’s the economy, stupid.’ Romney, who comfortably won five . primaries in New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut,, Rhode Island and . Delaware, used a victory speech in Manchester, New Hampshire – a key . swing state and the first primary state Romney won – to shift the focus . towards Obama. Victory: Republican presidential candidate, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney and his wife Ann wave to supporters in Manchester . With Rick Santorum out of the race and . Newt Gingrich – who had hoped to win in Delaware - expected to withdraw . at any time, Romney has now been fully embraced by the Republican party . as their presumptive nominee. Newt Gingrich once again hinted he might quit the presidential race last night after finishing nearly 30 points behind Mitt Romney in the one primary he hoped to win. Mr Gingrich got just 27.1 per cent of votes in Delaware – a winner-takes-all state where he had campaigned most vigorously for its 18 delegates. The former Speaker of the House told a small crowd in Concord, North Carolina:  ‘I want you to know over the next few days, we’re going to look realistically at where we are at.’ The night before before Mr Romney swept the board in Delaware and five other states, Mr Gingrich said he would ‘take a deep look at what we are doing’ after the results. He hinted that he would continue running until the May 8 primary in North Carolina, NBC News reported. Standing beside his wife, Callista (pictured above), Mr Gingrich also acknowledged that ‘the results were clear enough’ in Delaware. Unlike Rick Santorum, who failed to endorse Mr Romney when he quit the race last week, Mr Gingrich also hinted that he may back the presumptive candidate. ‘I want you all to understand that Governor Romney is going to have a very good night and it is a night that he has worked hard for, for six years,’ he said. ‘And that if he does end up as the nominee, I think every conservative in the country has to be committed to defeating Barack Obama and let’s be very clear about this.’ ‘Four years ago Barack Obama dazzled . us in front of Greek columns with sweeping promises of hope and change,’ he said. ‘But after we came down to earth, after the celebration and . parades, what do we have to show for three and a half years of President . Obama? ‘Is it easier to make ends meet? Is it . easier to sell your home or buy a new one? Have you saved what you . needed for retirement? Are you making more in your job? Do you have a . better chance to get a better job? Do you pay less at the pump?’ Promising that he knew ‘how to lead us . out of this stagnant Obama economy and into a job-creating recovery’, . he predicted ‘a campaign of diversions, distractions, and distortions’ over the next six months. ‘That kind of campaign may have worked . at another place over in a different time. But not here and not now. It’s still about the economy …and we’re not stupid.’ He added: ‘Americans have always been . eternal optimists, but over the last three and a half years, we have . seen hopes and dreams diminished by false promises and weak leadership. Everywhere I go, Americans are tired of being tired.’ Most polls show Obama slightly ahead . of Romney but with the Republican having only just emerged from a . bruising primary, his aides are confident that the President is . eminently beatable. Obama is stronger among women and his . ‘likeability’ numbers are healthier than Romney’s. But the former . Massachusetts governor made clear he would not try to run a race about . personal popularity or pretend to have the kind of magnetic appeal that . Obama won with in 2008. He even predicted he would induce . tedium among voters. ‘I’ll probably start out talking about my wonderful . wife Ann – I usually do – and I’ll probably bore you with stories about . our kids and grandkids.’ At the same time, he gave notice that . he would push back hard against the notion that, as a venture capitalist . with an estimated worth of more than $200 million, that he is a . plutocrat out of touch with ordinary Americans. ‘I’ll tell you about how much I love . this country, where someone like my dad, who grew up poor and never . graduated from college, could pursue his dreams and work his way up to . running a great car company. Rally: Romney and his wife, Ann, take the stage at the election night event on Tuesday before a cheering crowd . Uproar: Returning to the state where a January primary victory propelled him to front-runner status, Romney delivered remarks . Glum: Newt Gingrich addresses supporters with his wife, Callista, during a rally in Concord, North Carolina. He hinted he may quit the race after trailing Mr Romney by 30 points in Delaware, the one state he hoped to win last night . Thin crowd: A man in a suit holding a placard with a love-heart exclamation point and a young man wearing a hoodie were among the 100 supporters who attended Gingrich's rally . Missing: Ron Paul, who came second in all but one state last night, has not been seen publicly since Sunday . 'Only in America could a man like my dad . become governor of the state in which he once sold paint from the trunk . of his car.’ DELAWARE: Romney (56%), Gingrich (27%), Paul (10%) NEW YORK: Romney (62%), Paul (16%), Gingrich (13%) CONNECTICUT: Romney (67%), Paul (13%), Gingrich (10%) PENNSYLVANIA: Romney (58%), Paul (13%), Gingrich (10%) RHODE ISLAND: Romney (63%), Ron Paul (24%), Gingrich (6%) )Romney said he would introduce himself . to voters who had not previously paid much attention to the Republican . primaries and ‘tell you a little bit about myself’. His wealth, he insisted, was . hard-earned. ‘I’d say that you might have heard that I was successful in . business. And that rumor is true . 'But you might not have heard that I . became successful by helping start a business that grew from 10 people . to hundreds of people. ‘You might not have heard that our . business helped start other businesses, like Staples and Sports . Authority and a new steel mill and a learning center called Bright . Horizons. 'And I’d tell you that not every business made it and there . were good days and bad days, but every day was a lesson.’ Filling up: Romney's victories are represented by red states, Gingrich purple and green for Santorum, who has now quit the presidential race .

"Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf has had to pull a campaign ad after it emerged that the actor vouching for his stint in the Peace Corps also appeared in a cannibal fetish film. Democrat Tom Wolf's advertisement featured Alan Benyak, 50, sitting on the hood of a Jeep and talking about Wolf's time in India. Benyak has many strings in his bow - he's an attorney who was a Democratic candidate for judge in Washington County, he served in the U.S. Army - and he's something of an actor. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Campaign ad: Alan Benyak appears in gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf's ad touting the Democrat's Peace Corps experience in India . Interesting role: Benyak also played a character called Mr Cannibal in a 2013 'torture porn' film called Breeding Farm about a farmer who kidnaps women and forces them to breed . However, his previous acting work differs wildly from the wholesome campaign ad for Wolf. In 2013, Benyak played Mr Cannibal in a film 'torture porn' film called Breeding Farm. IMDB decribes the film: 'After a night of partying, four friends are kidnapped by a mysterious man. The friends wake up in a basement, and realize they are part of something horrifying. A human breeding farm. They are to be milked, bred, and much, much worse.' BuzzFeed reports that the film features Benyak 'torturing a half-naked woman, buying a woman, force-feeding a woman, engaging in cannibalism and inspecting a woman as if she is livestock.' Pulled: The staff of Tom Wolf (left) say they were unaware of Benyak's role in Breeding Farm (right) and have pulled the advertisement starring him . In other parts of the film, women are milked, beaten, raped and ridden. 'The campaign was unaware of Mr Benyak's involvement in the film, and we are making changes to the ad overall,' Jeff Sheridan, Wolf's press secretary told the Tribune. The film was directed by Cody Knotts, himself a Republican who twice ran for state House and lost. He alerted the public to Wolf's campaign ad's actor with a couple of tweets. 'I much prefer Benyak's performance in this video than the Tom Wolf one,' he wrote, adding a link to his film. Benyak is also the star of another unorthodox film, titled Lucifer's Unholy Desire. 'A young woman possessed by a demonic succubus; who then causes the death and destruction of the people around her through their deepest and darkest desires,' reads an IMDB synopsis. 'An exorcist is then called in to to try to bring an end to the mayhem and save the girl from evil's grasp before the demon can lead everyone around her to hell.' Out of the bag: The director of Breeding Farm, Cody Knotts, posted this tweet . Party lines: Knotts, a Republican who twice ran for state House and lost, also posted this tweet . According to a 2013 article in the Herald Standard, Benyak serves as legal counsel to the Mon Valley Police Association and the Municipal Authority of Belle Vernon. He is also a board member and officer of Donora Public Library. Press secretary for the Republican Governors Association quickly used the information against Tom Wolf. 'If Tom Wolf doesn't know who he is featuring in his ads to speak for his campaign, how can voters trust him to make the right decisions for Pennsylvania?' asked Jon Thompson. 'Unfortunately, I have become political fodder in a game of high-stakes politics due to a small role I played in a low budget film as a favor to a friend struggling to fulfill his own dreams,' Benyak wrote in an email to the Tribune. 'I'm a veteran, a small business owner, and I'm active in my community. If helping friends in need is what I'm charged with, then I am guilty, and I won't apologize for it.'","Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf has pulled a campaign ad .

"LeBron James isn't ready to let his two sons strap on shoulder pads and a helmet just yet. The NBA superstar doesn't want his boys, LeBron Jr. and Bryce, to play organized football because of safety concerns. He hasn't ruled them out playing the sport in the future, but for now he's insisting they stay off the field. 'We don't want them to play in our household right now until they understand how physical and how body demanding the game is,' James said following practice on Thursday. 'Then they can have their choice in high school, we'll talk over it. But right now there's no need for it. There's enough sports they can play. They play basketball, they play soccer, they play everything else but football and hockey.' No son of mine: Miami Heat's LeBron James speaks as his sons Bryce, left, and LeBron Jr. stand beside him and neither of them will be donning football garb anytime soon . James told ESPN.com last week while the Cavaliers were in Denver that that he didn't want his sons playing football because of the sport's dangers. 'Only basketball, baseball and soccer are allowed in my house,' James said . He's made similar comments in the past to the Associated Press. 'It's a safety thing,' he said Thursday. 'As a parent you protect your kids as much as possible. I don't think I'm the only one that's not allowing his kids to play football, it's just that I'm LeBron James and it gets put in the headlines for no reason.' James often refers to himself as a football player when talking about making physical plays. He's also a big football fan, and closely follows the Dallas Cowboys, Browns and Ohio State. Concerned for safety: LeBron James says he doesn't want his children to play football because it's a dangerous sport that causes long term consequences for players . The 6-foot-8 James was an All-Ohio wide receiver at Akron's St. Vincent-St. Mary High School. This summer, he brought his boys to the Browns' training camp, where they played catch on a side field as the team worked out. Before he concentrated on basketball, James said football provided a possible avenue for him to escape the inner city. 'I needed a way out,' he said. 'My kids don't need a way out. They're all right. I needed a way out when I was a kid. I tried to do whatever it took to get out. That's my excuse.' James told ESPN that his 7-year-old Bryce Maximus plays soccer while LeBron Jr., 10, like basketball.","The NBA superstar LeBron James doesn't want his boys, LeBron Jr. and Bryce, to play organized football because of safety concerns .

"The Mars rover Curiosity zapped its first rock on Sunday with a high-powered laser gun designed to analyze Martian mineral content, and scientists declared their target practice a success. The robotic science lab aimed its laser beam at the fist-sized stone nearby and shot the rock with 30 pulses over a 10-second period, NASA said in a statement issued from mission control at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory near Los Angeles. Each pulse delivers more than 1 million watts of energy for about five one-billionths of a second, vapourising a pinhead-sized bit of the rock to create a tiny spark, which is analyzed by a small telescope mounted on the instrument. Scroll down for video . Curiosity has begun its science mission on Mars by 'zapping' a rock with its laser analysis equipment . ChemCam's first 'real' science target will be rock exposed on the ground next to the rover by the rocket-powered crane used to lower the vehicle to the crater floor. The crane made four scour marks in the ground - two either side of Curiosity. These have been dubbed Burnside, Goulburn, Hepburn and Sleepy Dragon. Goulburn will be the first to be zapped by ChemCam. The ionized glow, which can be observed and recorded from up to 25 feet away, is then split into its component wavelengths by three spectrometers that give scientists information about the chemical makeup of the target rock. The combined system, called the Chemistry-and-Camera instrument, or ChemCam, is capable of discerning more than 6,000 different wavelengths in the ultraviolet, infrared and visible light spectrum and is designed to take about 14,000 measurements throughout Curiosity's Mars mission. The purpose of Sunday's initial use of the laser, conducted at roughly 3 a.m. Pacific time (7.00 a.m. EDT), was as 'target practice' for the instrument. But scientists will examine the data they receive to determine composition of the rock, which they dubbed 'Coronation,' NASA said. 'We got a great spectrum of Coronation - lots of signal,' said ChemCam principal investigator Roger Wiens of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where the instrument was developed. 'After eight years of building the instrument, it's payoff time.' Curiosity, a one-ton, six-wheeled vehicle the size of a compact car, landed inside a vast, ancient impact crater near Mars' equator on August 6 after an eight-month, 354-million-mile voyage through space.Its two-year mission is aimed at determining whether or not the planet most like Earth could have hosted microbial life. The first laser test by the Chemistry and Camera, or ChemCam, instrument aboard NASA's Curiosity Mars rover. The square inset is further magnified and processed to show the difference between images taken before and after the test . The rover's primary target is Mount Sharp, a towering mound of layered rock rising from the floor of Gale Crater. But mission controllers are gradually checking out Curiosity's sophisticated array of instruments before sending it on its first road trip across the Martian landscape. The $2.5 billion Curiosity project marks NASA's first astrobiology mission since the Viking probes to Mars during the 1970s and the most advanced robotic science lab sent to another world. The technique employed by ChemCam has been used to examine the composition of materials in other extreme environments, such as inside nuclear reactors and on the sea floor. Curiosity rover has also sent back its sharpest image of the 3-mile-high (5-kilometer-high) mountain, called Mount Sharp . The technology also has experimental applications in environmental monitoring and cancer detection. But Sunday's exercise, conducted during Curiosity's 13th full day on Mars, was the first use in interplanetary exploration, NASA said. Before Curiosity embarks on its 4.3-mile (7-km) trek to the foot of Mount Sharp, a journey that could take six months, mission controllers plan to send it out on a shorter jaunt to a spot 1,600 feet from its landing site.

"A child protection expert has warned that the BBC’s multi-million pound inquiry into the Jimmy Savile scandal is ‘too narrow’ to uncover the truth about the DJ. Mark Williams-Thomas gave several hours of evidence to the Dame Janet Smith Review last week and is the first of its more than 140 witnesses to speak publicly about the experience. He said Dame Janet ‘will never get to the bottom of what is really known’ about Savile because her inquiry’s remit does not extend far enough. An expert has claimed the BBC's probe into Savile's crimes is 'too narrow' to uncover the whole truth . The former Surrey Police officer added: ‘I have enormous respect for Dame Janet Smith. However, it’s quite clear there is a lot of information out there her inquiry is not aware of.’ He said he believes the former Appeal Court judge, who cannot compel anyone to appear because of her inquiry’s non-statutory nature, may be ‘frustrated’ by this and urged for an ‘overarching’ inquiry. He added: ‘There’s a significant amount of information that is slipping through the gap.’ The Smith Review, due to report this summer, was set up by the BBC to examine its culture and practices when Savile was there.","Mark Williams-Thomas claims the remit of the investigation is 'too narrow'

"A woman and her money are easily parted when it comes to anti-ageing beauty treatments. Or, to be more accurate, this woman and her money are easily parted. I’m intelligent and educated, but tell me that you can knock ten years off my face, no matter how daft the procedure, and I’ll be rushing to the cashpoint quicker than Usain Bolt. In the past I’ve been lasered, Hoovered, scrubbed and had everything from snake venom to leeches or flakes of gold rubbed into my face without a moment’s hesitation. Claudia keeps till as an ice-cold exfoliating paste made of nightingale droppings is applied . But, when it came to the prospect of my most recent procedure, I have to admit I did hesitate. It may be reassuringly expensive and loved by A-list celebrities, but the problem is that it just doesn’t sound very nice. Why? Because it involves having bird poo slathered all over my chops. Sometimes it is referred to as the  ‘Geisha facial’, other times it’s known as the ‘Nightingale facial’ (the species that provides the raw ingredient) or ‘Japanese facial’, but no matter how it’s dressed up it all boils down to one thing: having animal excrement smeared on your skin. The facial is said to have anti-ageing qualities as well as being highly effective in the treatment of acne scars. Victoria Beckham is reported to be a huge fan as is Tom Cruise and even One Direction’s Harry Styles. The droppings in question don’t come from any old nightingale — they are collected from a particular type, native to the Japanese island of Kyushu. So rare are the ingredients used that very few places offer the treatment and, when they do, it comes with a hefty price tag attached. Today I’m at the only salon offering it in the UK — Spa To You at the London Hilton Hotel on Park Lane, where clients pay £180 for a 90-minute session. My therapist, Kehmi, tells me that nightingale poo was first used as a beauty treatment in Japan back in the 17th century when geisha girls and kabuki (Japanese dance-drama) performers discovered it helped repair skin damage caused by the heavy lead-based make-up they wore. A gauze mask containing more nightingale guano goes on . As the ingredients used are entirely natural (albeit slightly gross) it is suitable for every skin type including my own very sensitive one that’s prone to flaring up with any product that’s too heavily perfumed or chemical-packed. The nightingales are fed on a special diet of seeds and berries (no juicy worms for them), therefore the droppings are organic and vegan. So that’s OK then. First, Kehmi cleanses my face in preparation for exfoliation with my first dose of droppings. I ask to see the nightingale poop and am relieved. I had envisaged a lumpy, gloopy grey mess similar to the one pigeons leave on my windscreen. In fact, the droppings are powder-fine and a soft yellow colour. After collection, they are treated with UV light to sanitise and dehydrate them before being turned into a fine powder and shipped  to salons. My mixture is a combination of the nightingale poo mixed in with a little rice bran. Bird dropping paste mixed with water reduces eye bags . While the nightingale’s song may be sweet, its droppings most  certainly are not. The exfoliator feels icy cold when applied to my face and smells like the inside of a hamster cage: musty, ripe and a little mouldy. Kehmi uses a steam machine to help the exfoliation process as it warms the skin, so the dead skin cells lift off more easily. After five minutes, the bird poop is wiped off my face. My face is then toned with rose water before being massaged in order to heat up the surface of my skin prior to the next stage — the application of a mask also containing nightingale guano (that’s excrement to you and me). A barrier cream is applied to prevent the mask from sticking to the hairs on my face and a series of gauze swatches are laid over the top. Kehmi warns me that some clients find the mask procedure claustrophobic as it sets and tightens on the skin and the mouth is usually encased. This time, the droppings have been mixed with a little water to form a paste — which turns the yellowy powder blue — which is then painted on to my face and neck. Second time around it doesn’t smell so bad, although I’m not sure if that’s because I have grown accustomed to it or whether the water has diluted the pong. In addition to anti-ageing your skin, one of the other alleged  benefits is that it helps to lighten pigmentation marks caused by sun damage and reduce the effects of unsightly eye bags. The nightingales are fed a special diet of seeds and berries so that droppings are organic and vegan . This is because the droppings contain an enzyme called ‘guanine’ that’s present in our own DNA. The amino acid works as a natural bleaching agent, lightening dark circles and blemishes. Urea (a waste product excreted in urine) is also found in the droppings and, while it’s another unappealing aspect of the treatment, it’s been found to help lock moisture into the skin. Grim as it all sounds, if it works, it’s just what I need as, in my teens before the dangers were fully known, I used sunbeds every weekend, resulting in lots of unsightly brown marks around my forehead and on my cheeks. The mask hardens after ten  minutes, making me look like Hannibal Lecter. After another ten minutes, it is lifted off in one piece. Any remaining residue is then cleaned away with rose water while a layer of moisturiser is applied. Immediately afterwards my skin feels and looks very soft and dewy but, in fairness, it feels that way after any pampering facial treatment. The question is, does it look and feel sufficiently good to justify the jaw-dropping price and the ignominy of the whole thing? On balance, I think the answer is yes. I notice a definite improvement in my dark circles and the sun damage marks on my forehead. I also have bad scarring on my chest following an unfortunate  incident with hot oil and a chip pan some years ago and the marks there are also significantly reduced. Kehmi advises me not to clean my face for at least 24 hours and explains that, for best results, the facial should be repeated monthly. Little does she know that, to get my money’s worth, it will be a lot longer than 24 hours before my cheeks see any soap or a flannel — and with that price tag it is unlikely I’ll be returning every four weeks. Two days later, I meet a friend for her birthday lunch and she tells me I look glowing before miming a needle going into my forehead to suggest I’ve had Botox. But I haven’t actually had any for more than a year. Since I reckon Botox takes around five years off my face and that my friend thinks the nightingale droppings have done the same, that’s a result I am more than pleased with. The mask is removed and moisturiser is then applied . Of course the bird poo facial isn’t that much cheaper than Botox but, as Kehmi explains, the reason the price is so high is that the ingredients are very hard to come by. ‘The droppings come from one farm in Japan and are very difficult to import. The birds are now protected and their droppings are no longer allowed to be gathered.It’s only the existing supply that can be used and, once it’s gone, that’s it — the nightingale facial will no longer be available.’ She estimates they have about another year’s supply left. It’s been several days since my treatment and, although sceptical, I have to say my skin has taken on a translucent quality that seems to have lasted. What about my wrinkles? It hasn’t made any impact on the deeper lines, but the fine ones around my eyes and lips aren’t nearly so noticeable. At £180 a pop, the nightingale facial will not become part of my regular beauty regime but as a one-off treatment to brighten, lighten and rejuvenate the skin — all I can say is, don’t poo-poo the idea.","Droppings are collected from nightingales .

"The Justice Department told MailOnline that it would not comment on the news . The White House is declining to explain its criteria for directing drone attacks against American citizens working abroad with terrorists following revelations that the administration requires no evidence of a pending attack to justify a strike. 'These strikes are legal, they are . ethical and they are wise,' White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday. He declined to discuss in detail a newly disclosed Justice Department memo saying only that the target must be involved in ongoing plotting against the United States for a strike to be justified. The White House is declining to explain its criteria for directing drone attacks against American citizens working abroad with terrorists . Drone force: The U.S. government can legally order the killing of American citizens if they have senior-level ties to al-Qaida . He said President Barack Obama takes . seriously his responsibility to protect the United States and its . citizens and that great care is taken to avoid the loss of innocent . lives. Controversy over U.S. drone policy mushroomed after a September 2011 drone strike in Yemen killed two American citizens. The newly revealed memo, which is not an official legal document, sheds new light on the reasoning behind a reported increase in the number of drone strikes used against Al Qaeda suspects in recent years -- including those aimed at American citizens -- under the Obama administration. The undated memo, ‘Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen who is a Senior Operational Leader of Al Qa’ida or An Associated Force,’ was reportedly provided to members of the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary committees in June by unnamed administration officials. It was provided on the condition that authorities keep the memo confidential and not discuss its contents publicly, according to NBC. ‘The condition that an operational  leader present an “imminent” threat of violent attack against the United States does not require the United States to have clear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future,’ the memo states. Insight: The document sheds new light on the legal reasoning behind a reported increase in the number of drone strikes used against al-Qaida suspects in recent years, including those aimed at American citizens . The Justice Department told MailOnline that it would not comment on the news. The Obama administration has remained relatively hush about reports of increased drone strikes carried out since 2008. The Long War Journal reports that the U.S. has been conducting a covert program to target and kill Al Qaeda and Taliban commanders in Pakistan's northwest region. ‘The US ramped up the number of strikes in July 2008, and has continued to regularly hit at Taliban and Al Qaeda targets inside Pakistan,’ the non-profit news outlet writes. ‘There have been 332 strikes total since the program began in 2004; 322 of those strikes have taken place since January 2008.’ The New York Times reported in November that the Obama administration had been mapping out a strategy weeks before the presidential election to develop definitive rules for the targeted killing of terrorists by drones, so that a new president would ‘inherit clear standards and procedures’ if Obama was not re-elected. The secrecy surrounding such strikes may soon be unraveled, as indicated by the release of the 16-page Justice Department memo. Proponent: John Brennan, Obama's pick for CIA director, has called drone strikes 'consistent with our inherent right of national self-defense' John Brennan, a White House counter-terrorism adviser, one of the leading architects behind the government’s drone policy and Obama’s pick to become the country’s new CIA director, is expected to face tough questions about his involvement in Obama’s drone program during his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday. Brennan was the first administration official to formally acknowledge drone strikes in a speech he gave at the Woodrow Wilson Center in April 2012, calling drone strikes ‘consistent with our inherent right of national self-defense.’ A bipartisan group of 11 senators wrote a letter to Obama on Monday asking his administration to provide its legal justification for its use of drone strikes over the past four years. ‘We ask that you direct the Justice Department to provide Congress, specifically the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, with any and all legal opinions that lay out the executive branch's official understanding of the President's authority to deliberately kill American citizens,’ the senators led by Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon wrote in their letter. Political blogger Marcy Wheeler, who says she has closely tracked the group’s repeated requests, writes that it was at least the 12th time Congress had asked for those documents. Among the overseas attacks that have killed U.S. citizens with terrorist ties on Obama's watch, a September 2011 missile strike in Yemen took out . alleged Al Qaeda members Anwar al-Awlaki and Samir Khan. Both men were . U.S. citizens who had never been indicted by the U.S. government or . charged with any specific crimes. Read the full Justice Department white paper released on Monday night here.

"A British doctor shot dead  by the Taliban was part of a humanitarian mission that had helped 2,000 Afghans, an inquest heard yesterday. Dr Karen Woo was executed alongside nine other aid workers after they tried to cross a mountain river in August last year. The 36-year-old, who was due to get married a fortnight later, suffered  ‘catastrophic’ injuries from two gunshot wounds in the attack. Killed: Karen Woo who specialised in maternal and neo-natal care was on her third visit to Afghanistan . Shortly before her death she had helped to save the life of a baby boy who was struggling to breathe. Her team had been halfway through a 120-mile, three-week expedition in the northern Nuristan Province when they were ambushed. It was one of the worst attacks on aid workers in the region for 30 years. The inquest in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, heard that Dr Woo, who specialised in maternal and neo-natal care, was on her third visit to Afghanistan at the time. Hertfordshire coroner Edward Thomas said ‘he had nothing but admiration’ for her incredible life and the work she did delivering medical supplies to a region where one child in five does not reach its first birthday. Gone to soon: Karen left, and her fiance Paddy Smith were due to marry last year . He said: ‘The mission up to the point of the tragedy was a great success. 'I have been given a figure of them . helping 2,000 people and the reports indicate that Karen had assisted a . baby in being able to breathe again and saved its life.’ At the time of the killing the Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, accusing the International Assistance Mission – the group Dr Woo was working with – of preaching Christianity. But Mr Thomas said that was untrue and that the doctor, who had given up a well-paid surgeon’s job with Bupa, was murdered simply because there were some people who were ‘not happy that they were there’. He added: ‘They were killed in an area where they were helping and supporting the population. Mountainous: The Badakhsan area, pictured, where Karen and her colleagues were killed . ‘Their reason for being there was . humanitarian and all of them lost their lives trying to make the area . medically better. I have no doubt that the people they helped were . devastated.’ He also said that the FBI was still hunting for those responsible for the massacre of Dr Woo and the ‘fine people’ she was with, which included one German and six American medics. After her death, Dr Woo’s family set up a charity to buy medical equipment in her memory. Her fiancé, Paddy Smith, 37, a former Army captain, said: ‘Karen was trying to help those who couldn’t help themselves, with no access to basic needs, and that is what we are trying to do with the foundation. Verdict: Coroner Edward Thomas said Karen and her colleagues were murdered because some people were 'not happy that they were there' When she was out there I received a . call about her bringing this baby back to life, everyone was amazed that . a woman doctor could do this’. After leaving school at 16, Dr Woo, . from Stevenage in Hertforshire, first trained to be a dancer and was a . wing walker in her 20s. She then obtained a medical degree and worked in . Australia, Trinidad and Tobago and Papua New Guinea. The coroner recorded a verdict of unlawful killing.","Dr Karen Woo was with nine others in the Kuran Wa Munja district of .

"A mother whose sex offender ex-boyfriend murdered her infant daughter has branded his 25-year prison term too lenient. Barry McCarney was today given the life sentence tariff in Belfast Crown Court for the murder of 15-month-old Millie Martin in what the judge described as a 'sadistic sexual assault'. But Rachael Martin, the toddler's mother, criticised the sentence, saying: 'Twenty-five years isn't long enough.' Scroll down for video . Jailed: Barry McCarney (left) will serve at least 25 years behind bars for killing his ex-girlfriend Rachael Martin's (right) daughter Millie. Ms Martin branded the sentence too lenient saying: '25 years isn't long enough' Guilty: McCarney (pictured with his 15-month-old victim in his arms) was found guilty of her murder by a unanimous verdict . Barry McCarney pictured at A&E department of the Erne Hospital with Mille Martin in his arms on the evening she was admitted, she died from head injuries the following day . Her mother and Millie's grandmother Margaret Graham said 33-year-old McCarney, who was not the child's father, should never be freed. She said: ‘It wasn't long enough - life should be life.' ‘He should never see the light of day again. We won't ever see Millie, her mummy won't ever see her wee daughter and life should mean life.’ McCarney took Millie to Erne . Hospital in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland after she sustained serious . injuries from his attacks. He was filmed trying to give her CPR, but the 15-month-old girl later died. McCarney's father Kevin insisted he was innocent of the murder and would be appealing against the verdict. He said: ‘We will be appealing the case and we know he will be proved innocent.' In setting the minimum term McCarney must serve of his life sentence, Mr Justice Ben Stephens explained that the sentencing framework in Northern Ireland was very different to that in England and Wales, where a whole life term could be handed down. Tragic: McCarney took Millie Martin to hospital after she sustained horrific injuries from his attacks . Horrific: Millie died in hospital a day after she was admitted with devastating injuries . Behind bars: McCarney will serve at least 25 years in prison, a sentence criticised by the girl's mother . He said the offence was serious enough to use the upward starting point guide of 15 to 16 years. Explaining that aggravating features, . among them the vulnerability and fragility of the victim, required him . to make a ‘substantial upward adjustment’, he told McCarney he would . have to serve at least 25 years. Once the 25-year term is spent, . McCarney can only be released, on licence, if parole commissioners deem . he no longer presents a danger to the public. Setting . the minimum sentence McCarney must serve, judge Ben Stephens told the . labourer at Belfast Crown Court he was a 'deeply manipulative man'. McCarney was also found guilty of grievous bodily harm with intent and sexual assault of Millie. Mr . Stephens told him he must serve at least six and two years for those . crimes respectively, but those terms will run concurrently with his . murder tariff. McCarney, clean shaven and dressed in a grey jumper, showed little emotion as the judge delivered his sentencing decisions. His . ex-girlfriend Ms Martin looked on from the public gallery. At the same . trial last year, she was acquitted of charges of allowing her daughter’s . death and cruelty through wilful neglect. McCarney met Ms Martin just three months before the little girl's death. He quickly eased his way into the family home in Enniskillen, which allowed him access to Millie. The judge said McCarney had duped Ms Martin into believing he cared for Millie and she was therefore willing to leave her daughter alone with him. He said: ‘You gained the total trust of Rachael Martin, you appeared to her to be very good to Millie,’ he said. On the night the toddler sustained the fatal injuries, McCarney had persuaded his girlfriend to go out to a shop to buy him a chocolate bar. Justice Stephens said he was already on his way up the stairs with the intention of sexually abusing the young child in her bed as Ms Martin was reversing her car out of the driveway. The judge said McCarney had struck Millie's head on a hard surface in response to her cries as he inflicted a brutal sexual assault. That head injury would ultimately kill her. Anger: Rachael Martin, pictured outside court today, said that she thought the sentence was inadequate . Rachel Martin leaves Belfast Crown Court with her family after hearing Barry McCarney's sentence . A pathologist found that Millie had . suffered 21 cracked ribs, seven of which were old, while the rest had . happened in the ten days before her death. Multiple bruises were also found on the youngster's body along with a clearly visible oval shaped bump on her forehead. During the post-mortem examination, the pathologist found injuries to her  abdomen caused by punching or prodding which would also have been fatal. Millie had also been sexually assaulted. The prosecution described the attacks on her as vile and sadistic. McCarney blamed Millie's mother, claiming at trial that she had inflicted the injuries on her own daughter and that he was sickened by her death. Speaking only through his barrister, he alleged that Ms Martin did not want social services involved because she had done these 'terrible things' herself. But in a case . with no forensic evidence to suggest who inflicted Millie's injuries, . the jury rejected McCarney's claims and accepted that Ms Martin had . unwittingly let a monster into her home, taking just three hours to . reach a unanimous verdict. He was found guilty of murder, sexual assault and causing grievous bodily harm. Ms Martin's family issued a statement saying the family would now be able to grieve properly as a result of the verdict. They described the last three years as a 'waking nightmare' and described McCarney as a 'disgusting individual'. They also questioned why Ms Martin was ever prosecuted in the first place. Her brother, Matthew, speaking on behalf of the family said the police decision to prosecute her was 'shocking' at a time when she should have been left to grieve for baby Millie. Outside court, Ms Martin's stepfather Noel Graham said he was pleased McCarney, who he described as a ‘scumbag’, would be off the streets away from women and children. He said: ‘We have been dealt a life sentence which will never go away.' On McCarney's protestations of innocence, Mr Graham added: ‘If he had have been half a man he would have gone into the court and told the jury (the truth) and didn't leave everything unanswered.’","Barry McCarney was jailed for life for the murder of Millie Martin .

"Furious Muslims are flooding the internet with their own version of the Ice Bucket Challenge in protest against the Islamic State - by burning the terror group's flag. Dozens of pictures and videos are trending on Twitter and YouTube showing campaigners from America to Lebanon setting fire to the black jihadist standard. The groundswell of disgust comes after the sickening beheadings of two U.S. journalists which were even denounced by hate cleric Abu Qatada. Scroll down for video . Burning hatred: Protesters in London set fire to an Islamic State flag in a new craze that has adapted the Ice Bucket Challenge to vent their disgust at the terror group's brutality . Outrage: The movement, which uses the hastags #BurnISISFlagChallenge and #BurnISIS, started in Lebanon (above) with a group of students disgusted by the beheading of one of their soldiers last month . Fuming: Two demonstrators from the feminist protest group Femen, which originated in the Ukraine, set a jihadist flag alight as part of the #BurnISISFlagChallenge that is sweeping the internet . A woman holds a burning ISIS flag in a Twitter picture with the message: Burn that flag! Kill the flagwavers! One image posted on Twitter shows demonstrators in London torching an IS flag with the message: 'Arab World's version of the Ice Bucket Challenge.' Another shows a middle-aged woman holding a burning flag with the defiant tweet: 'Burn that flag! Kill the flagwavers!' A video uploaded to YouTube which has more than 100,000 views also urged everyone else to follow suit. It said: 'I nominate the whole world to the #BurnISISFlagChallenge. You have 24 hours. GO!!' The movement, which uses the hashtags #BurnISISFlagChallenge and #BurnISIS, started in Lebanon with a group of students disgusted by the beheading of one of their soldiers last month. Yesterday, even Qatada, who was extradited from Britain to Jordan on terror charges in July last year, condemned the barbaric tactics employed by the Islamic State. Qatada was once described by a Spanish judge as the right-hand man in Europe of al-Qaeda terror network founder Osama bin Laden. Speaking to reporters from the dock at an Amman courthouse about the beheadings of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, he said: 'Journalists should not be killed because they are messengers of the truth.' He also branded IS 'a killing and demolition machine' and likened its fighters to 'dogs of hellfire'. Up in flames: The groundswell of disgust comes after the sickening beheadings of two U.S. journalists which were even denounced by hate cleric Abu Qatada . Sherlock  actor Benedict Cumberbatch has waded into Middle East politics, comparing the Muslim militants of Islamic State to the Nazis. The actor, who protested publicly against the Iraq War, said he would willingly go and fight against the terror group, calling their murderous creed ‘astonishing and terrifying, and needs to be opposed’. He insisted the rise of IS was a direct result of the Iraq War, and was proof that ‘you can’t kill an idea with bombs, in fact you often strengthen ideas with bombs’. He told the Daily Beast website: ‘If there was conscription and I was asked, I would go, because it’s fundamental to every person’s ideology on the planet, no matter what race or creed you are. It’s their way or death.’ Cumberbatch went on: “That’s as clear-cut a divide in morality and principles as we’ve faced with fascism in the Second World War…it’s a form of ethical and moral genocide.’ The Harrow-educated actor believes the ‘smart way’ of opposing IS is to ‘understand it totally first’. Fuelling the campaign: Dozens of pictures and videos are trending on Twitter and YouTube showing campaigners from America to Lebanon setting fire to the black jihadist standard . Disgusted: An ISIS flag burn in this picture posted on Twitter by a user from London . Meanwhile, U.S. warplanes have wiped out . Islamic State insurgents menacing Iraq's Haditha Dam with five air . strikes that widened what Barack Obama called a campaign to ultimately . defeat the jihadist movement. The aerial assault drove Islamic State fighters away from the dam, according to a police intelligence officer in the vast western province of Anbar, a hotbed of Islamist insurgency. The U.S. military said in a statement that the strikes destroyed four IS Humvees, four IS armed vehicles, two of which were carrying anti-aircraft artillery, an IS fighting position, one IS command post and an IS defensive fighting position. ISIS are 'dogs of hellfire': Even hate cleric Abu Qatada (above), who was recently extradited from Britain to Jordan on terror charges, has condemned the barbaric tactics employed by the Islamic State . U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the strikes on the Sunni Muslim insurgents had been carried out at the request of the Shi'ite Muslim-led central government in Baghdad. 'If that dam would fall into [Islamic State's] hands or if that dam would be destroyed, the damage that would cause would be very significant and it would put a significant, additional and big risk into the mix in Iraq,' Hagel told reporters during a trip to Georgia's capital, Tbilisi. Obama said on the weekend he would explain to Americans this week his plan to 'start going on some offense' against Islamic State. 'We are going to be a part of an international coalition, carrying out air strikes in support of work on the ground by Iraqi troops, Kurdish troops,' he said in an NBC TV interview. 'We are going to systematically degrade their capabilities. We're going to shrink the territory that they control.

"A young man who told police he was beaten up in a would-be hate crime appeared in court today admitting that he made the entire incident up. The story of Joseph Baken travelled from Missoula, Montana across the country when a picture of his scratched and bruised face made waves on the internet. Now, Baken has declared in court that he made the false police report after video surfaced of him attempting to do a back flip and failing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Before and after: Joseph Baken told police that he was beaten up (right) by three people because he was gay but he later admitted that he falsified that statement only after video evidence emerged . Police say that Baken initially claimed three men beat him early Sunday after he went into a Missoula bar, announced it was his birthday and asked if anyone knew where he could find a gay bar. Photos of Baken's badly bruised face were posted on an anti-homophobia Facebook page and other sites, and the case prompted widespread support from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. The site alleged that the fictitious assailants used anti-gay curses targetted at Baken's homosexuality. 'Nobody deserves this, especially no just because of your sexuality,' the organizers wrote on the Wipe Out Homophobia page. Shortly after the case began to rise to national attention, police received an anonymous video of Baken attempting to do a backflip off of a street curb and subsequently hitting his face on the sidewalk. As a result, he was charged with filing a false police report, to which he plead guilty on Wednesday. Flip fail: Video emerged of Baken attempting to do a back flip on a Missoula, Montana curb . Police officer Scott Brodie says the decision to file charges was partially due to the fear and anger prompted by his claims. Now the same anti-homophobia sites are criticizing Baken, saying that he was making light of an issue that is extremely serious to many who are true victims of hate crimes. The only shining examples in this case? The Missoula police and officials who Montana activists are praising for their swift and sharp response to the claims. 'The city of Missoula should be proud of the way it responded, and we will continue to work toward including assaults that target Montanans based on their sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression in the legal definition of hate crimes in our state,' Jamee Greer of the Montana Human Rights Network told the local Billings Gazette.

"Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin has reported to a federal prison in Texarkana, Texas, to begin serving a 10-year sentence for corruption during the years when the city was struggling to recover from the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina. Nagin arrived at the facility shortly before noon Monday. New Orleans television stations showed images of Nagin hugging family members in a parking lot before he entered the lockup. Nagin, a Democrat, was thrust into the national spotlight in 2005, when Katrina overwhelmed levees and flooded 80 percent of New Orleans, killing 1,500 people and causing some $80 billion in damage. Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin arrived at a federal prison in Texas on Monday to begin serving a 10-year sentence for corruption . Corrupt: Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin was handed a 10 year prison term for money laundering, accepting bribes, and other corrupt misdeeds . The bribes came in the form of money, free vacations and truckloads of free granite for his family business. The 58-year-old Democrat had defiantly denied any wrongdoing after his 2013 indictment and during his February trial. He plans to appeal his conviction. He has said in court filings that he is nearly penniless, and has been granted a court-appointed lawyer. The onetime cable company executive who served as New Orleans' mayor from 2002-2010 was convicted on 20 criminal counts including bribery, conspiracy and money laundering, all tied to payments he received for granting city contracts. Then: Elected in 2002 with strong support from the business community and white voters, Nagin won re-election in 2006 with a campaign that sometimes played on fears among black voters that they were being left out of the city's spotty recovery . Nagin was convicted February 12 of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars from businessmen who wanted work from the city or Nagin's support for various projects. Seeking re-election in 2006, Nagin, a black politician who had enjoyed strong support from both black and white voters, seemed to adopt a racially divisive tone, urging residents to rebuild a ""chocolate New Orleans,"" referring to its majority black population. The Bureau of Prisons operates a low-security prison in Texas with an adjacent minimum security camp. Bureau spokesman Chris Burke said Nagin reported to the minimum security camp. Under federal sentencing rules, Nagin would serve about 8-1/2 years in prison with good behavior . Meanwhile, a public defender in New Orleans is pursuing an appeal of Nagin's February conviction on charges including bribery and money-laundering. The charges stemmed from the Democrat's two terms as mayor from 2002-2010. Nagin was a political newcomer when he won election as New Orleans' mayor, succeeding Marc Morial in 2002. He cast himself as a reformer and announced crackdowns on corruption in the city's automobile-inspection and taxi-permit programs. A New Orleans neighborhood destroyed by hurricane Katrina is shown in this 11 September 2005 photo. Many of Nagin's misdeeds occurred as the stricken city struggled to re-emerge from the rubble of Katrina . But federal prosecutors say his own corrupt acts began during his first term, continued through the Katrina catastrophe and flourished in his second term. Until his indictment in 2013, he was perhaps best known for a widely heard radio interview in which he angrily, and sometimes profanely, asked for stepped-up federal response in the days after levee breaches flooded most of the city during Katrina. He also drew notoriety for impolitic remarks, such as the racially charged ‘New Orleans will be chocolate again’ and his comment that a growing violent crime problem ‘keeps the New Orleans brand out there.’ Elected in 2002 with strong support from the business community and white voters, Nagin won re-election in 2006 with a campaign that sometimes played on fears among black voters that they were being left out of the city's spotty recovery. He was limited by law to two consecutive terms but a third term would have been unlikely, giving plunging approval ratings and the stricken city's continued recovery struggles. He was succeeded in 2010 by Mitch Landrieu. They also said that what Jenkins calls an ‘aberration’ was behavior that spanned six years and involved multiple contractors.","Ray Nagin, 58, is serving a 10-year sentence for bribery, money laundering and other corruption .

"An Only Way is Essex super fan who ran away to Syria with her toddler has posted this selfie from her home in an ISIS stronghold. Tareena Shakil, 25, is seen grinning alongside 14-month-old son Zaheem in a picture sent to her distraught family back home in Burton on Trent. Shakil and her son have been given a room by ISIS warlords in Raqqa, where she fled to become a 'jihadi bride'. Her father Mohammed, 42, said she sent him the picture to show they had arrived but she has since cut off all contact. Selfie: Tareena Shakil, 25, who ran away to Syria with her toddler has posted this selfie from her home in an ISIS stronghold of the pair of them smiling . Syria selfie: Tareena Shakil, 25, pictured with 14-month-old Zaheem, has run away to Syria and has sent a picture to her family from the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa . He told The Sun: 'She sent this last week after she arrived and she has now cut off contact. She thinks they are safe there but they are not. She said before she left that ISIS would provide housing and social security. The  one-time Spice Girls fan, school prefect and Girl Guide was so fascinated with the ITV reality show that she travelled 150 miles to buy clothes at a shop run by one of its stars. Her parents said she was wearing items she bought there when she set off for Syria, lying to her family that she was taking her 14-month-old son on holiday to Spain. But secretly she had become obsessed with extremist propaganda she found online. It is feared Miss Shakil plans to marry a jihadi in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa . In terrifying messages home, she told them 'so many people died' when they 'got shot at the border' but that she and her son Zaheem made it because she 'ran across'. It is feared Miss Shakil plans to marry a jihadi in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, in the latest case of a British Muslim woman joining the group that murdered UK hostages Alan Henning and David Haines. Miss Shakil grew up in Burton-on-Trent in Staffordshire. 'Tareena did drama and was in the Guides,' her father told The Sun. 'She loved the Spice Girls and TOWIE.' Mr Shakil said she did a psychology degree and got married, although she later divorced. But around four months ago she set up a Facebook page under the name Tameena al Amirah and started posting extremist messages, including images of Islamist fighters and the IS black flag, and calling herself a 'slave to Allah'. Last week she set off with Zaheem, telling her family she was going to Spain. In reality she bought a ticket to Turkey, from where she crossed the porous border into Syria. 'There was no reason to suspect,' her father said. 'She left wearing jeans and a top she bought in a shop owned by one of the TOWIE stars. My little grandson shouldn't be going through this.' Miss Shakil has told her family she is in Raqqa and can never return. One message reads: 'I can't come back there now … we can't. Tell her don't cry. Read the Koran, I love you mummy!' Of her journey, she wrote: 'So many people died coming. They got shot at the border. But we made it. We ran across the border in the blazing sun.' Around four months ago, Tareena Shakil set up a Facebook page under the name Tameena al Amirah and started posting extremist messages .

Like any father, I just want the best for my daughter. 'We want her to know how much we love her and want her back safely as soon as possible.' Mr Shakil was jailed for 28 months in 2011 after police stopped his car and found crack cocaine, heroin and mobile phones he used to deal drugs. He admitted possessing a knife. His son Tazeem, 22, featured regularly in a local paper which dubbed him 'Burton's most prolific persistent young offender', with 20 convictions and an Asbo by age 14. Aged 17, it reported he had 'turned over a new leaf' and started work at a local firm, but three years later he was jailed for crashing a car into a house and fleeing the scene while banned from driving. The couple have two younger children. Local MP Andrew Griffiths said he would do 'whatever he could' to help the family. 'I think this news will have shocked everyone across Burton,' he said. 'We now need to ensure this does not happen to others.' Miss Shakil's disappearance is being investigated by West Midlands Police as she is thought to have been living in Birmingham.

"While congressional gun control advocates and gun-rights supporters duke it out with words and parliamentary tactics, Texas Republican Rep. Steve Stockman is showing off his Second Amendment fervor by doing what some consider unthinkable: giving away a Bushmaster AR-15rifle, the same weapon crazed murderer Adam Lanza carried to a Connecticut elementary school where he massacred nearly two dozen children. Stockman, a congressional freshman whose campaign boasts on Twitter that he is 'the most conservative Congressman in Texas,' is angling for a second term. His campaign - not his government office, spokesman Donny Ferguson told MailOnline - is offering the unusual prize to entrants who join his online mailing list. Twitter erupted late Wednesday after the congressman announced the prize giveaway by tweeting: 'Want to win a FREE AR-15? Congressman Steve Stockman is giving one away! ... Grab this gun before Obama does!' 'You really are an unpleasant blowhard of a man, aren't you?' tweeted one liberal gun control advocate in response . The Stockman campaign sparked outrage in April with a bumper sticker reading 'If babies had guns they wouldn't be aborted. Vote Pro-Life!' Wednesday's tweeted slap at President Barack Obama seemed, to some, a calculated attempt to incite gun-control advocates. But Ferguson, Stockman's spokesman, told MailOnline that his boss has heard little other than praise. 'Here in the congressional office the response has been overwhelmingly positive,' he said. 'What Democrats have called in have been universally violent and mentally unstable.' 'There is nothing more psychotic and violent than an anti-gun activist. But people across the country love the idea and support the civil right to keep and bear arms.' Rep. Steve Stockman's 2014 re-election campaign is giving away an AR-15 rifle, the same model used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that left 20 children and six adults dead. But most responses have been positive, his spokesman said . Brad Woodhouse, the Democratic National Committee's communications director, slammed Stockman for his insensitivity toward families of the Newtown victims . 'If the [Sandy Hook] school had 1 guard on duty with an AR-15 those people would be alive today,' a Stockman supporter tweeted . But one prominent Democratic communicator fired back online, lambasting Stockman for what he suggested was insensitivity. 'Thanks for your feelings for the parents of 20 dead children in CT,' Democratic National Committee Communications Director Brad Woodhouse tweeted. 'Just had to pick that gun, huh?' Pro-Stockman partisans rushed to his aid, including one who argued in a tweet that 'if the school had 1 guard on duty with an AR-15 those people would be alive today.' Others noted that Lanza didn't fire his AR-15 during his killing spree, leaving it in the trunk of his car where police later found it, unused. Connecticut State Police led a line of children away from the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut on Dec. 14, 2012 after gunman Adam Lanza killed 20 of their schoolmates. The NRA argues that an armed guard could have stopped Lanza before he shed any blood . The National Rifle Association, America's largest gun-rights organization with a reported 5 million members, issued a report in April calling for more armed guards in the nation's schools. Its May convention was a gun-fest of monumental proportions, giving members the opportunity to hold handguns, rifles and shotguns in thousands of makes, models and configurations - including the AR-15. 'I don't know what the big deal is about the AR-15,' NRA member Chuck Smith told MailOnline in Houston on May 4. 'It's just a gun like any other. Should we stop renting Ryder trucks because Tim McVeigh used one to blow up a federal building in Oklahoma?' 'That's just as silly as everything else the gun controllers want,' he said. The Bushmaster AR-15 semi-automatic rifle has been labeled an assault weapon by gun control advocates. Congressman Steve Stockman's re-election campaign is giving one away at random to a supporter who joins its email distribution list, provided he or she passes a background check and meets other legal requirements . Culture clash: While gun control advocates cite the safety of children as a primary reason to restrict the availability of high-powered rifles and large-capacity ammunition magazines, the NRA mad the same equipment available for children to hold, under parental supervision, during its Houston convention . The Stockman campaign's online defenders have emphasized that the winner must be 18 years old and will be subject to the same eligibility requirements of any gun buyer. 'Firearms prizes must be claimed through a licensed firearms dealer in accordance with federal, state and local law,' the contest's rules read. 'Firearms prize winners must meet all legal requirements and will be subject to a dealer’s background check.' 'Eligibility is open only to persons who can lawfully receive and possess the prize, under 18 USC § 922 and any other applicable laws.' That section of federal law deals with the ownership, transfer, licensing and carrying of firearms. Pro- and anti-gun advocates clashed on Twitter over Stockman's AR-15 promotion . The Stockman re-election campaign claims on Twitter that he is 'the most conservative Congressman in Texas' and boasts a '100% lifetime NRA' rating for his votes on gun control measures . The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees 'the right to keep and bear arms.' But tweets on both sides of the issue kept at it through the night on Wednesday and into Thursday morning. 'When you have to mow down a room full of schoolkids, accept no substitute!' carped one Stockman foe about his campaign's choice of the AR-15. 'How much would one of those teachers [have] given to have one when Lanza came calling?' came an indignant, tweeted reply.","One supporter of freshman congressman Steve Stockman will win the gun, subject to a background check .

"Police have reportedly spotted a missing man who shot dead an ex-Marine and injured a state trooper 10 days ago, but he has refused to surrender. On Monday, law enforcement officials said on scanner reports that they had positively identified 31-year-old Eric Frein in a search area of the  Pocono Mountains, thePocono Record reported. Police would not confirm or deny seeing Frein in a press conference this morning. Authorities have allegedly been authorized to use lethal force if Frein refused to surrender, according to Monroe County emergency radio reports. However, they did share pictures of an AK-47, believed to have been used or stored by Frein for his attack on a state police barracks in the Poconos Mountains. The discovery of the weapons comes as Pennsylvania Gov Tom Corbett spoke Frein at a press conference, saying local authorities are 'confident' they will find the man still 'out in those woods right now'. Police found this AK-47-style rifle and magazines as they continue to hunt for cop-killer Eric Frein, 31, in the Poconos . Police have narrowed down their search for Frein based on a number of sightints. 'Based on our investigation, we know Frein has prepared and planned extensively for months or maybe years,' State police Lt Col George Bivens said on Sunday. 'He planned his attack and his retreat - however, we believe we are closing in on him.' Frein has been on the run since Friday September 12 after allegedly using a high-powered rifle to open fire from the woods near a state police barracks, killing Cpl Bryon Dickson - a married ex-Marine with two sons - and wounding Trooper Alex Douglass. At large: Eric Frein, 31, is still on the run ten  days after police said he killed an ex-Marine and a state Trooper . The search team has largely shut down the area where he lived with his parents and erected barricades around the area. A 'shelter in place' order has been lifted for residents but citizens have been urged to avoid the woods and take caution when outside of their homes. Law enforcement officers wearing bulletproof vests and armed with rifles were seen marching the streets, with an unmarked helicopter flying overhead. Frein - described as holding a grudge against police - is now on the FBI's Most Wanted list. 'Our troopers are determined to find him and bring him to justice,' state police spokeswoman Maria Finn said. Police released few details about their search of the heavily wooded community in the Poconos, saying only that they were exercising extreme caution. Closing in? Officers insist they have narrowed the search to lock down on the area where Frein's parents lived. Above, Pennsylvania State Police officers move quickly with their weapons on Route 477 on Sunday .

(AP Photo / The Scranton Times-Tribune, Butch Comegys) Frein, a self-taught survivalist, has been on the run ever since, authorities said. But some who know him said he has not always played the loner, and the reason for his hatred of police remained a mystery. Frein belonged to the rifle team at Pocono Mountain High School, and as an adult joined a group that performed military re-enactments of Eastern European conflicts in the modern era. He even played a small role in a 2007 movie about a concentration camp survivor - earning him a mention in the movie database IMDb - and helped with props and historical references on a documentary about World War I. 'He was a very friendly guy to me,' said Jeremy Hornbaker, who hired him for the documentary. 'We left on very good terms.' Frein's father, retired Army Major E. Michael Frein, told police that he had taught his son to shoot. Order lifted: A Shelter In Place order for residents has been lifted but police warn residents to avoid the woods . Flashing lights: Police State Police vehicles speed up Snow Hill Road on Route 447 in Price Township on Sunday . Wanted: Posters have been released across Pennsylvania and in neighboring states to track down Frein . Reward: The FBI is offering a reward for anyone who finds Frein, who is on the bureau's Most Wanted list . He 'doesn't miss,' the father told state police during a search of the family home, when he also disclosed that an AK-47 and a .308 rifle with a scope were missing. It is not clear which, if any, of these rifles was the gun found today. A copy of the book, 'Sniper Training and Employment,' was found in his bedroom. Frein had for a time attended nearby East Stroudsburg University and held a number of jobs over the years but never any for very long, authorities said. A week after the killing, they had not said anything about what may have led to his hatred of police. Frein's only known legal problems stemmed from the 2004 theft of some vendor items at a World War II re-enactment in Odessa, New York. He failed to show for his trial, and was arrested in Pennsylvania as a fugitive from justice. On Frein's MySpace page, a photo appears to show him standing in front of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade. Frein played the part of a Serbian soldier in his re-enactments and the FBI said he had claimed to have studied Russian and Serbian and to have 'fought with Serbians in Africa.' The FBI's Most Wanted poster describes him as 6'1"", 165lb. State police said he apparently cut his hair into a wide Mohawk in preparation for the attack. He was also described as a heavy smoker. Police did not say how big of an area they are combing or whether they believed they had Frein. A police dispatcher said there was a report of gunfire Friday night but investigators released no information.","Authorities have narrowed in on the hunt for Eric Frein, 31, who is still at large ten days after carrying out a gun attack at a state police barracks .

"With his finger on the trigger and his eyes fixated on the target ahead, these chilling photos show a babyfaced Eric Frein training with his high school shooting team. Now 31-years-old, the 'Cold War-obsessed' survivalist sniper has been placed on the FBI's most Wanted Fugitives list after he allegedly gunned down state trooper Byron Dickson during an ambush on Friday. The bureau is offering a $100,000 reward for anyone who has information that leads to his capture as the manhunt entered its sixth day. Pennsylvania Crime Stoppers have also said they will hand over $75,000 to anyone who has vital information on his whereabouts.

As the search for Cpl. Dickson's killer continued 40 miles away, police Commissioner Frank Noonan told hundreds of mourners gathered at St. Peter's Cathedral in Scranton, Pennsylvania, that the father-of-two 'was no ordinary trooper.' The mourners included Dickson's wife, Tiffany, who wore dark sunglasses as she held the hand of their youngest son Adam. The FBI said at a news conference today it is assisting in the search with 'manpower, technical and air assets' and that Frein's photo will be 'broadcast on electronic billboards up and down the whole East Coast.' 'We have now made the world where he can hide a very small place,' said Edward Hanko, FBI special agent in charge of the Philadelphia division. A roadblock was set up around Frein's parents home on Thursday, but it was reopened and officers confirmed he is still at large.

Dickson, 38, was gunned down late Friday outside his rural barracks in the Pocono Mountains. Police are still searching for the suspected shooter, 31-year-old Eric Frein who is charged with killing Dickson and wounding another trooper in an ambush that authorities said was likely fueled by his hatred of law enforcement. They believe he is still in the general area, adding that one of his hobbies is surviving outside. Lt. Col. George Bivens said he is probably trying to endure the cold night somewhere in the woods, something he has done in the past. Schools near the Blooming Grove barracks shut down a second day Thursday even as police said it's likely law enforcement, not the public, would be the target of any further violence. Yesterday it was revealed Frein belonged to a 'military simulation unit' whose members play the role of soldiers from Cold War eastern Europe. It was also revealed Frein learned to shoot from his father, Eugene Michael Frein, 64, a retired Army major with 28 years of service. Dickson (seen left with his wife Tiffany and two young sons, Bryon III and Adam) was a Marine Corps veteran who joined the state police in 2007 and had worked as a patrol unit supervisor in the Blooming Grove barracks since June . He told state police his son was a better marksman than he and someone who 'doesn't miss.' Mourners attending Dickson's funeral Mass gathered 'in sorrow, disbelief and anger,' the Rev. Thomas Muldowney said, but he asked them to focus on the positive impact that Dickson made during his life.

"Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords' astronaut husband Mark Kelly and his identical twin brother have been selected to take part in an experiment which will study the impacts of space life on the body. Mark Kelly flew on four space shuttle missions before retiring in October 2011 to spend more time with his wife, Ms Giffords, after she was shot while meeting with constituents earlier that year. His identical brother Scott continues to be an active astronaut and is set to live on the International Space Station for a year starting in spring 2015. One of these things is not like the other: Mark Kelly (right) and his identical twin brother Scott (left) will take part in a study on how space life impacts the body . The experiment: Scott Kelly will live on the International Space Station for a year while his brother will stay on earth. Both will undergo the same periodic medical tests, one brother in space and the other on earth . During that year, both brothers will help researchers study how the human body reacts to space life, by undergoing periodic medical examinations. Mark and Scott Kelly are good candidates for this type of research because they share practically the same DNA. Any differences between them therefore can be attributed to their environmental differences. 'It offers an opportunity for an extra control to see if that can help us better understand this long-duration spaceflight process,' International Space Station program scientist Julie Robinson told Scientific American. But other scientists are doubtful the experiment will yield any usable results since only one set of twins will be studied. Famous couple: Mark Kelly is the husband of former Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in 2011 while meeting with constituents . 'This strikes me as a bit silly,' said Tim Spector of Kings College London, who founded the UK Twins Registry. 'You can compare the same person before and after [spaceflight] better than you can compare the person and their twin. If they'd taken both of them on the mission, the could have explored how similarly they behave.' NASA admits that not all of the aspects of the experiment are ideal - since the Kelly brothers won't be able to keep the same diet, carbon dioxide levels and sleep schedule. 'Obviously the sample groups have to have a certain number to be statically significant, so some of the science we're going is more anectodal,' Scott Kelly said. 'But you can learn something and maybe learn about certain phenomena that you would then decide to investigate further.' The Kelly brothers were born in Orange, New Jersey and went on to be captains and test pilots in the U.S. Navy before eventually joining NASA in 1996. Becoming an astronaut is an extremely difficult thing to do, and the fact that both of them made the cut . shows just how important genetics can be. According to NASA, the idea . for the experiment comes from the Kelly brothers themselves. Survivor: Kelly retired from NASA in October 2011, following his wife's injury. Above, Ms Giffords on her last day in the House of Representatives . Despite having so much physically in common, the brothers say they are quite different people personality-wise. 'I'm the smarter of the two and the better-looking, with the more charming personality,' Scott recently joked. But in reality 'we're two individuals who were born on the same day from the same egg, but other than that we are two different people.' The overarching goal of Scott Kelly's mission on the ISS is to study how the body reacts to long term space exposure. The 2015 mission will be the first time astronauts have spent an entire year on the ISS. Scott Kelly will be joined on the ISS by Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko .","Both Mark and Scott Kelly joined NASA in 1996 .

"Media baron Rupert Murdoch bought himself a lavish divorce present – the top four floors of one of the most exclusive condominium towers in Manhattan. Murdoch, 82, reportedly paid over $57million for the new bachelor pad at One Madison, which overlooks Madison Square Park in the Flatiron District and is also home to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and his supermodel wife.

"Barack Obama made a point of shaking hands with every one of the medical workers gathered for a White House photo-op today as he hailed the work of Ebola-exposed health care professionals. The president thanked the 'hero' doctors and nurses for their work in West Africa and insisted that they must be treated with dignity and respect. He conceded, though, that Americans will 'likely see more cases' of the disease, which kills more than half of those diagnosed. A series of controversies have erupted, most visibly in New Jersey, surrounding the difficult question of whether Americans who work with Ebola patients overseas should be forcibly quarantined upon their return. Obama said he was 'a little frustrated' by 'people talking about American leadership' but then 'running in the opposite direction and hiding under the covers' when Ebola emerges - an apparent dig at New Jersey's Governor Chris Christie. Quarantines for Ebola typically last 21 days, the length of the disease's incubation period. Some of Obama's guests were still within that time-frame, meaning that they could possibly be harboring the virus without yet showing any outward symptoms. Scroll down for video . In touch: President Obama shakes hands with an unidentified medical worker at a White House reception for healthcare professionals who have been working to tackle Ebola in West Africa . Safe to embrace: Dr. Ken Brantly, who has been medically cleared as Ebola-free, got a presidential handshake . It was unclear which of the doctors and nurses were within the 21-day period, but he shook hands with all of them. Ebola can be spread through contact with bodily fluids, including sweat. Human hands are the body parts that sweat the most. Obama said Americans 'can't hermetically seal ourselves off' from the world in the fight against Ebola. Discouraging their work with restrictive measures that confine them upon their return, he added, would be a bad policy. 'We will contain and eventually snuff out this outbreak,' the president pledged. 'We don't run and hide when there is a problem.' He didn't name any particular states, governors or policies, but his point was understood as a jab at New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whose statewide quarantine mandate goes far beyond what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers necessary. The New Jersey leader has been at the center of a row over the treatment of Kaci Hickoc, who was put into quarantine after arriving at Newark Airport and who claimed she was being mistreated by being detained. Obama also embraced Kenneth Brantly, a U.S. doctor who was treated for Ebola but has since been declared free of the viral infection. His remarks came in the East Room of the White House. Some of the health care workers have already been in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea, where the disease has killed more than 5,000. Others will soon go there. The president paid tribute to the health care workers 'on the front line in West Africa'. 'We need to call them what they are,' he said: 'American heroes' who show 'what is possible when America leads'. Obama cited an improvement in the mood of Ebola-stricken countries as an example of 'American exceptionalism'. Moments later he complained about policies that might make health care workers reconsider braving the inconveniences associated with traveling to fight Ebola. the president said Americans 'can't hermetically seal ourselves off' from the world in the fight against Ebola . FOUND! White House Ebola Response Coordinator Ronald Klain, a former chief of staff to two vice presidents whose lack of a medical background has made him a political punching bag, attended the photo-op . 'We are at our best when we are standing up and taking responsibility,' Obama said. 'Making sacrifices especially when it requires sacrifices.' 'That's how we help others around the world ... It's not just massive deployments of troops and equipment. As proud as we are of that, it's also our skill and compassion and painstaking effort and our ability to learn from mistakes that are made, and our ability to work through problems that are complicated.' 'And to see something through. And not lose our heads. To have grace under pressure. And apply ourselves with slow, steady effort. The kind that change and progress requires. That's what I want to see from us, the pride of a nation that steps up to get the job done.' 'Ebola czar' Ronald Klain, the Democratic Party operative tapped to coordinate what the White House calls a 'whole of government response' to the Ebola crisis, was in attendance on Wednesday but said nothing publicly. Klain's absence from public view has led to charges that the White House isn't as serious about combating the public health threat as it is about managing the political risks just days before an election. D.C. pundits have joked about the 'Where's Waldo'-style parlor game involved with spotting the all-but-invisible Klain. The White House says he spoke with the president on six of his first seven days on the job. Nurse Kaci Hickox (left), who was quarantined at Newark Liberty Airport this weekend when she returned from West Africa, on the orders of Gov Chris Christie (right) to detain anyone potentially exposed to Ebola . The nurse was released from Newark University Hospital (above) on Monday after threatening to sue over her being kept in it. But Gov Christie said she had 'takeout food from the best restaurants in New Jersey . Nurse Kaci Hickox is now at her home in Maine, where she continues to protest over previous treatment and is now at odds with the governor of that state over whether she can leave the house . DEFIANT CHRIS CHRISTIE TO NURSE WHO MAY SUE HIM OVER EBOLA QUARANTINE: 'WHATEVER, GET IN LINE.' New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie blew off on Tuesday claims by a nurse that she was treated inhumanely when she was under mandatory quarantine over the weekend for Ebola. Speculating about the possibility of a lawsuit from the nurse, Kaci Hickox, Christie said, 'Whatever. Get in line. I've been sued lots of times before. 'Get in line. I'm happy to take it on,' he added, according to CNN. Christie disputed the nurse's claims that she was mistreated and pointed out that the tent she was confined to was indoors, not outdoors, as early reports claimed. 'There's been all kinds of malarkey...about this,' Christie told reporters who trailed while on a campaign stop in Rhode Island. 'She was inside the hospital in a climate-controlled area with access to her cell phone, access to the internet, and takeout food from the best restaurants in Newark,' he said. Christie has been heavily scrutinized over his decision to keep Hickox in quarantine for several days after she tested negative for Ebola. Attorney Steven Hyman speaks to his client, quarantined nurse Kaci Hickox, at the isolation tent at University Hospital in Newark, N.J., where Hickox was confined after flying into Newark Liberty International Airport . Abrupt: Chris Christie had a brief and pointed response when he was asked about the potential for Kaci Hockox to sue: 'Whatever. Get in line.' He added that she had been well-treated and disputed her claim she was in a hospital car park . The nurse came from West Africa by way of a New Jersey airport last week. She found herself summarily quarantined by state health officials after they detected she had a slight fever - a common symptom of Ebola. But even after the nurse's fever subsided, health officials kept her confined to a tent at a local hospital that had no shower or flushable toilet. She has obtained a high-powered civil rights lawyer to defend her in a potential lawsuit. The lawyer, Norman Siegel, told Reuters on Sunday that Hickox's quarantine raised 'serious constitutional and civil liberties issues.' The New Jersey government has since allowed Hickox to return to her home in Maine. Christie, a possible, 2016 presidential candidate, has denied that her release was an about-face, however. He has also refused to rescind the state's new policy requiring health workers returning from West Africa to self-quarantine at home for 21 days, the incubation period for Ebola. On Tuesday he maintained that he didn't think he'd done anything wrong in keeping her isolated until health officials could be sure she didn't have Ebola. 'We're trying to be careful here,' Christie said on NBC's Today show. 'This is common sense, and ... the American public believes it is common sense. And we're not moving an inch. Our policy hasn't changed, and our policy will not change.' At the campaign event later that day Christie pointed out that the Centers for Disease and Control staff who were 'on the ground in University Hospital monitoring the conditions she was in' didn't think the state treated Hickox unfairly, either. 'She had access to the Internet and we brought her takeout food,' he said. Pouncing on Christie's comment, Gawker called some of Newark's 'finest' takeout restaurants and found that none of them delivered food to Hickox - or at least not to the restaurants' knowledge. As Christie noted New Jersey officials brought Hickox the food, so takeout restaurants may not have been aware they were feeding the Ebola patient.","Doctors and nurses, including some who could be incubating the disease, appeared in East Room photo-op with the president .

"The police trooper shot dead in an ambush by a 'Cold War-obsessed' sniper survivalist was an impeccable officer who put his family first, it emerged at his funeral today. As a manhunt for Cpl. Bryon Dickson's killer continued 40 miles away, police Commissioner Frank Noonan told hundreds of mourners gathered at St. Peter's Cathedral in Scranton that the father-of-two 'was no ordinary trooper.' The mourners included Dickson's wife, Tiffany, who wore dark sunglasses as she held the hand of their youngest son Adam. Dickson, 38, was gunned down late Friday outside his rural barracks in the Pocono Mountains.

Schools near the Blooming Grove barracks shut down a second day Thursday even as police said it's likely law enforcement, not the public, would be the target of any further violence. Yesterday it was revealed Frein belonged to a 'military simulation unit' whose members play the role of soldiers from Cold War eastern Europe. It was also revealed Frein learned to shoot from his father, Eugene Michael Frein, 64, a retired Army major with 28 years of service. Dickson (seen left with his wife Tiffany and two young sons, Bryon III and Adam) was a Marine Corps veteran who joined the state police in 2007 and had worked as a patrol unit supervisor in the Blooming Grove barracks since June . He told state police his son was a better marksman than he and someone who 'doesn't miss.' Mourners attending Dickson's funeral Mass gathered 'in sorrow, disbelief and anger,' the Rev. Thomas Muldowney said, but he asked them to focus on the positive impact that Dickson made during his life. Dickson, a Marine Corps veteran who joined the state police in 2007, had worked as a patrol unit supervisor in the barracks since June.

"Can a single finger test determine whether you are beautiful or ugly? Apparently so, if the latest social media craze is anything to go by. On Weibo, the Chinese version of Facebook, thousands of users are participating in the 'Beauty and Ugliness Identification Method' also known as the 'finger trap test'. So how do you determine if you're 'beautiful'? Place your index finger against your chin . and nose to see if your lips touch it. If they do, congratulations, you're officially hot. If they don't, just ignore the results. Beauty test: On Weibo, the Chinese version of Facebook, thousands of users are participating in the 'Beauty and Ugliness Identification Method' also known as the 'finger trap test', if your finger touches your lips, you're officially beautiful like James Hollobone, pictured . Even Chinese celebrities have posted photos of themselves trying out the bizarre test, which is trending in over 200,000 Weibo discussions, where the majority of participants are women. The trend, which was spotted by Vocativ.com., is being dubbed China's digital answer to 'Hot or Not'. It is loosely based on the 3.1 ratio theory, which is used by cosmetic surgeons to . create the 'perfect profile' which equates to your nose, lips and chin . all being in a perfect line down your face. Is he hot? The trend is being dubbed China's digital answer to 'Hot or Not'; Paddy Hyslop, pictured, is beautiful, if the test is anything to go by . Dr . Mark Holmes at McIndoe Surgical Centre said of the test: 'This is . actually a bone fide test for lower facial symmetry and proportions. It . is called Rickett's E-line. 'Like . the Golden Ratio devised by the ancient Greeks, they are tests . experienced cosmetic doctors use when assessing and planning cosmetic . treatments. 'Is . it a sign of beauty? That's a stretch. But part of beauty is determined . by symmetry and correct proportions. However, it take no account of . someone's energy and personality.' Not so hot: Bianca London isn't classed as attractive but it's OK, beauty is only skin deep, after all... Consultant cosmetic surgeon Brent Tanner, who works out of the Spire Tunbridge Wells Hospital, Nuffield Health Brighton Hospital and Montefiore, Hove, added: 'Although this trend is based on classical principles that date back to the time of Leonardo Da Vinci it is a very simplistic view and beauty is based on much more than one set of ratios. 'It’s a fun test to do but must be taken with a pinch of salt. Beauty is not only in the eye of the beholder but we must remember that throughout the world different races not only have different characteristics but also different beauty ideals and therefore this is far too general to convey any real meaning.' This concept dates back to the 1950s and the work of the orthodontist Dr. Robert Ricketts, who focused on what he called the 'E-plane'. This is simply a line drawn from the tip of the nose to the tip of the chin. He believed that to have what he called a  'pleasing facial profile', in the average caucasian face, the lips would touch the plane - or in the finger trap's case, the finger- running from the nose to the chin.","Known as 'Beauty and Ugliness Identification Method' or 'finger trap test'

"A Democrat running for the Senate in Kentucky is so worried about the negative effect being associated with President Barack Obama could have on her campaign, she wouldn't even admit to voting for him on Thursday when asked by a newspaper about her past support for her party's leader. Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes refused to reveal her vote in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections to the Louisville Courier-Journal editorial board during an endorsement interview yesterday, claiming 'this election isn't about the president.' Pressed to give a simple yes or no answer, Grimes, who has been open about her support for Obama in the past, began talking about how she backed Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary and tied herself to former president Bill Clinton's policies. Kentucky's Democratic Senate nominee, Alison Lundergan Grimes, wouldn't say yesterday whether she voted for Barack Obama in 2008 or 2012 despite having openly announcing her support for him in the past. She's pictured here speaking at the Fancy Farm picnic in August in Fancy Farm, Kentucky . She then tried to wiggle her way out of the tight spot by telling her interviewers, 'I respect the sanctity of the ballot box, and I know that the members of this editorial board do as well.' 'So you're not gonna answer,' one of the board's members replied, matter-of-factually. 'Again, I don't think that the president is on the ballot, as much as Mitch McConnell might want him to be,' she said referring to her Republican opponent. 'It's my name on the ballot, and it's gonna be me holding [Obama] accountable for the failed decisions and votes he had made against the people of Kentucky.' A longtime Democrat who won the office of secretary of state in 2011 with the support of her party, Grimes is the daughter of a former Democratic Party chair of Kentucky, Jerry Lundergan. Grimes' father also served as a state representative - an office he proudly held as a Democrat. Asked about the risks associated with supporting Obama in 2012 by the Lexington Herald-Leader, Grimes said: ‘I’m a lifelong Democrat. I’m very proud of that and the values our party stands for. My support of our party and our nominee is well-known.’ Grimes has sought to distance herself from the Democratic president throughout her campaign against McConnell, however, even releasing an ad last month definitively stating that she's 'not Barack Obama,' just in case anyone was confused. And like most other Democrats facing tough election battles, she's evaded the president on the campaign trail, opting to have Democratic surrogates like the Clintons campaign for her instead. Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes campaigns with former U.S. President Bill Clinton on August 6 in Lexington, Kentucky. Grimes in a virtual tie with the incumbent, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and is touting her support for the Clintons instead of Obama in her efforts to woo Kentucky voters . But Grimes' attempt to disown the president entirely sets a new precedent for Democrats this election cycle. While other high-profile Democrats have claimed that they disagree with the way the president has handled certain issues and have publicly suggested they don't want him campaigning for them, none have disavowed him completely. Grimes latest move shows just how toxic candidates from the president's party believe the once-beloved national leader to be now, a mere one and a half years into his second term. Obama has not had an approval rating above 45 percent in Gallup's weekly tracking poll since last year. Just one Democrat, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, is even willing to be seen with the president at a public campaign event. Grimes' fear of losing her race to incumbent senator McConnell, a Republican who has held the seat since 1985, is not unfounded. A recent CNN survey of Kentucky voters found that only 29 percent of the state's residents think Obama is doing a good job. And three out of four polls taken in the last month showed McConnell up by four to six points over Grimes.","Asked to reveal her vote in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections yesterday, Grimes said, 'this election isn't about the president'

"Birger Stromsheim, one of the Norwegian commandos who carried out the legendary 'Heroes of the Telemark' raid, has died aged 101 . One of the last two survivors of the legendary Second World War 'Heroes of the Telemark' raid, which helped thwart Hitler's plans to build a Nazi nuclear bomb, has died aged 101. Just 31 at the time, Norwegian Birger Stromsheim was the oldest member of the team who successfully destroyed the heavy water production facility at the Norsk Hydoelectric plant in Telemark, southern Norway. The raid, which is regarded as one of the most successful acts of sabotage in World War II, was also remarkable for the fact all the team managed to escape by cross country skiing 250 miles into Sweden. The heavy water, or deuterium oxide, . which the Norsk plant produced was essential to the German scientists . working on an atomic bomb project and the allies were desperate to . destroy it. But it was no . soft target. Perched on an icy ravine, surrounded by machine gun-toting . guards and floodlights the plant was virtually impregnable. An . earlier attempt to destroy it had ended in bloody failure when some of . gliders carrying the team of 30 Royal Engineers crashed in bad weather. Those who escaped were captured by the Gestapo, tortured and then executed. For the second attempt the Special Operations Executive gambled on a small six-man squad, all Norwegian, who would parachute in. After . intensive training using a mocked up model of the basement of the plant painstakingly recreated at . the explosives base in Brickendonbury, Hertfordshire the team were . ready for action. They . were issued thick nordic-style woollen jumpers and brilliant white . camouflage smocks to protect themselves from the elements. Crack squad: Some of the saboteurs back in Britain after the raid. Aged 31 at the time Mr Stronsheim (circled) was the oldest member of the team . The plan was for them to meet up with four members of the previous mission's advance team who had manged to survive a harsh winter living in an abandoned cabin and eating lichens and moss scraped off rocks. Mr Stormsheim would play a vital role. An explosives expert, he was known for having a cool head - something that would prove invaluable if things didn't go to plan. And of course they didn't. Operation Gunnerside began in ernest on February 17 1943 and got off to a disastrous start when bad weather resulted in the team landing some 18 miles form the planned drop zone. They were forced to spend five days struggling through fierce snow storms before finally linking up with their compatriots. By February 27th the team had regrouped and was ready to launch their assault. The Norsk plant was connected by a . bridge stretching over the steep ravine so to avoid the German guards . the commandos opted to climb down one side of the ravine, wade across . the icy river Maan and scramble up the other side. They . would then follow a railway track that led all the way into the plant, . get inside through a door which a plantworker was supposed to leave . open, set their charges and escape. Leaving . their radio operator at the top of the ravine in case anything went . wrong, the rest of the party struggled for hours through thick snow to . make it to the river before beginning the arduous task of climbing up . the other side. Exhausted . and soaking wet they eventually scrambled to the top and broke into the . grounds of the facility using a pair of bolt cutters. The raid was hailed as the most successful act of sabotage of WWII and was later made into the Hollywood film Heroes of the Telemark staring Kirk Douglas . When they arrived at the basement door which was supposed to have been left open they were devastated to find it still locked. They split up into two parties Stromsheim and Kasper Idland found a window at the back of the basement and took the risk of smashing their way in. Meanwhile the other party, led by the 23-year-old commander Joachim Ronneberg, managed to crawl through a cable duct before taking a Norweigan plant worker by suprise. Ronneberg heard Stromsheim smashing the window as he began to lay charges and when Stromsheim and Idland entered the room they were nearly shot by their own colleagues who had mistaken them for guards. Stromsheim then placed the remaining charges while Ronneberg set the fuses. Fearing the Germans could discover them at any moment they used 30 second fuses instead to the planned two minute ones. The team dashed outside the plant as the charges went off with a dull thud. Mercifully the guards were not alert. The . mission had been a stunning success and around 1000lbs of heavy water - . so vital to Hitler's dreams of world domination - was washed away. Now there was just the small matter of escape. The . commandos managed to make it all the down the ravine and back up the . other side before the Germans were alerted, but now a chase was on. Stromsheim . and his comrades ploughed on into a snowstorm, using their wooden cross . country skis to make the epic 250 mile journey into neutral Sweden. 'They . didn’t reckon that they would get out alive,' Mr. Stromsheim’s son, . also named Birger, recalled. 'They weren’t sure of that. They were . scared in some ways, but there was no panic.' Back . in Britain the the SOE chiefs were delighted at their success  - and . heralded the mission as the most successful act of sabotage of the . Second World War. Hollywood treatment: Kirk Douglas, (left), and Richard Harris keep a watchful eye for Nazis in the 1964 film . The Nazis were forced to relocate their heavy water project and move their remaining supplies of the essential ingredient Potassium Oxide. But the ferry they used to move it was subsequently sunk by a Norweigan resistance. In his report the mission's commander Joachim Ronneberg described Stromsheim as 'beyond doubt the best member of the party'. For his part in the mission, Stromsheim was awarded the British Military Medal and the Norweigan St Olav medal, the US medal of Freedom and the French Legion of Honor and Croix de Guerre. His escapades were later given the Hollywood treatment in the 1965 film Heroes of the Telemark starring Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris. Mr Stromsheim and his wife were among the many Norwegians who fled to England when the Nazis occupied their country in 1940. Although he had never been a soldier he became part of Britain's Special Operations Executive, which had been set up to coordinate resistance in occupied Europe. Following the assault on Norsk Hydro, Mr. Stromsheim would join Mr. Ronneberg on a series of other missions. He is survived by a son, a daughter, four grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. His wife, Aase Liv, died in 1997. Joachim Ronneberg is now the mission's only living survivor aged 93.","Norwegian Birger Stromsheim was one of the last two living survivors of operation Gunnerside .

"Twenty years after Sir James Dyson invented the bagless vacuum cleaner, his firm has launched a machine that never needs to have its filter cleaned. The company has spent six years working on the Dyson Cinetic, which it says will work without losing suction for at least ten years. Dyson claims it has improved its famous cyclone technology to reduce the amount of dust that gets stuck in the filter, meaning it no longer needs to be replaced or even cleaned, but still maintains its performance. Scroll down for video . Revolutionary: How the Dyson vacuum cleaner will be able to run for 10 years without its filters being cleaned . The machine goes on sale tomorrow for £419 to £469, depending on the number of add-on accessories. Sir James described the development as the most significant since it removed the bag from the vacuum cleaner in 1993. Britain is falling behind the rest of the world because it is not training enough engineers, Sir James Dyson said yesterday. The inventor, right, whose firm now makes all its products in Malaysia and Singapore, said expertise and technology no longer exists for high-tech production in the UK. Speaking on US television, he said: ‘One of the reasons we do this in Singapore, which is a very expensive country, is because we have all the support for the robots and the automated equipment there which we wouldn’t have in England. ‘Unfortunately, we have to have this factory in Singapore... The problem is manufacturing has drifted away so fast [in Britain] we have lost the skills to make things.’ Sir James, whose firm still carries out its research and development in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, said he was trying to address the lack of engineers in the UK by funding programmes at universities including Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester and Imperial College, London. He added: 'Getting rid of bags solved the frustration of my vacuum losing suction. ‘Washing filters – or worse, buying them – is still a nuisance. Dyson Cinetic cyclones are so efficient at separating microscopic particles that everything gets thrust into the bin, and you can forget about fussy filters.’ The firm said a team of 29 engineers went through 50 versions of the technology, with 2,000 prototypes and at a cost of £7.5million, before perfecting the system. They found that by shrinking the cone-shaped cyclones inside the cleaner – and having more of them – they could increase the power of the centrifugal force generated, sending more dust straight into the waste container and leaving less to float on to the filters. The new DC54 model has 54 cyclones, compared to 14 larger ones in the best-selling £330 DC39. Each cone works like a chimney, with the clean air escaping up out of the centre, and the dust and dirt being flung to the outside of the cones and out of the hole at the bottom. One problem the engineers faced was that the smaller cones were more likely to clog with dust. So they developed a flexible rubber section at the bottom of each cone that oscillates and vibrates with the airflow, ensuring all the particles are pushed through. Alex Knox, Dyson’s director of engineering, said: ‘We know people don’t wash their filters. With no maintenance, the filter slowly blocks, the machine loses suction and your machine’s performance drops.’ Practice makes perfect: Sir James said 29 engineers went through 2,000 prototypes costing £7.5 million .","Almost 30 engineers went through 2,000 prototypes to make the DC54 .

"They've been employing a recent display of frugality, in keeping with the scale of the economic crisis facing Spain. And it seems the Spanish royal family's new austere stance isn't about to change - even for the most important event in the past 40 years. Although plans have not yet been announced, it appears that the imminent coronation of Prince Felipe could also be a . rather modest affair. Crown Prince Felipe of Spain and Princess Letizia of Spain visited a students' residence in Madrid earlier today, as news emerged of the low-key scale of the king-in-waiting's plans for an austere coronation . The event, which is understood to be taking place on June 19, will be a secular event and will instead . feature just a simple proclamation, as well as a military procession, in front of . Spanish politicians. Palace and government spokesmen have already said . no foreign dignitaries will be invited to the ceremony, largely . due to the late notice given to plan the event. Even Prince Felipe’s father, King Juan Carlos, has signalled he does not intend to be at the ceremony to see his son take over his throne. But . fervent royalists have attacked the plans, saying a low-key affair . would waste a rare opportunity to showcase Spain on the global stage. Monarchist . newspaper ABC said the austerity policy threatened to tarnish the . handover, claiming in an editorial: 'Unless we see a sudden change in . strategy that could save the celebration, Spain looks set to miss out on . an historic opportunity to project its image abroad.' Political . leaders are also said to be trying to persuade the royal family to . change its mind about the foreign dignitaries, although observers say it . has probably been left too late. But a palace spokesman said there would not be room in parliament for an extended guest list, saying: 'We aren’t going to make people come just to leave them outside.' It . is believed the steps are being taken at the request of Prince . Felipe, who wants a smaller celebration than that of his father King . Juan Carlos, who was crowned four decades ago after the death of . dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975. It is the third time in as many days that the heir to the throne and his glamorous wife have been pictured at public events, showing they are ready for the coronation, which is due to take place next week . It seems the king-in-waiting has made the . request out of awareness of the economic crisis devastating the . country, as well as weekend . republican protests in several parts of the country. But despite the lack of ceremony around the occasion, it is expected that the new king and his wife Letizia will present themselves to the public from the balcony of the . official Royal Palace in Madrid after the event. King Juan Carlos and his wife Queen Sofia did the same after the coronation in 1975. It is thought the couple will then embark on a royal tour of foreign nations, beginning with Spain's neighbours Morocco, Portugal and France. When Juan Carlos was sworn in a king, pictured above, it was a much larger affair than what is expected from the imminent coronation of Crown Prince Felipe, pictured third from right as a young boy. The event included a mass after the coronation which is not expected to be held this time around . King Juan Carlos was crowned in 1975 after the death of General Francisco Franco, pictured left. After the coronation, he and Queen Sofia greeted Spaniards from the balcony of the Royal Palace in Madrid, right . But despite the planned low-key nature . of the event, the king-in-waiting and his wife have been putting in . several public appearances over the past few days to prove they are . ready for the statesmanship that awaits them. Princess . Letizia of Spain has oozed class at . three different events in as many days, including a visit to student . residences today in Madrid, Spain. The princess and her husband also joined . the royal family at a lavish gala dinner on Tuesday, as part of celebrations to . welcome the Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, to Spain. After that, they 'dressed down' to receive members of the Patronage of the Prince of Asturias Foundation at the Royal Palace in Madrid. King Juan Carlos of Spain, who has been on the throne for nearly 40 years, announced last week that he was abdicating . She had . already spent the afternoon networking, at a reception hosted by King . Juan Carlos for the arriving president on the steps of the Zarzuela Palace, in Madrid. The events, although arranged to welcome the Mexican president to Spain, were a chance for Princess Letizia to publicly show her support for her husband. King Juan Carlos of Spain announced last week that he planned to end his four-decade reign in favour of his 46-year-old son. And earlier today, the Spanish Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favor of urgent government legislation allowing King Juan Carlos to abdicate and hand over his duties to Crown Prince Felipe. The shock decision to end his 39-year reign came days after it was . claimed Carlos told courtiers he decided to abdicate because he did not . want his son to ‘wither’ and ‘grow old waiting for the throne like . Prince Charles’. In a . televised address, the 76-year-old said he . wanted to herald in a ‘new era of hope’ and ensure a ‘younger . generation… with new energies’ could take over the helm. According . to reports in the Spanish press, the king told aides he felt the time . was right to pass the throne on while Prince Felipe was still a young . man. ‘I do not want my son to wither waiting like Prince Charles,’ he reportedly told Rafael Spottorno, chief of the royal household. Prince Felipe and his wife Princess Letizia were seen at a reception for the Mexican president as well as a royal gala dinner earlier this week as they prepare for their new roles as state heads of the country . The private secretary said the king – whose popularity has slumped in recent years following a series of scandals – had been considering abdicating since his 75th birthday in January last year. However, last week, a source at the royal palace in Madrid claimed King Juan Carlos was abdicating for political reasons. The monarch’s popularity has nosedived amid accusations of being out of touch as his country struggles with its worst economic crisis in memory. In 2012, he was widely criticised for going on a secret hunting trip to Botswana to shoot elephants. The lavish holiday contrasted with the news at home that one in four Spanish workers was jobless. Prince Charles has been waiting for 62 years and four months – longer  than any other heir apparent in British history – to take the throne. He became heir apparent at the age of three when his mother, then Princess Elizabeth, who is now 88, acceded  in 1952.","Crown Prince Felipe, 46, is due to be enthroned as King of Spain on June 19 .

General Sir Nicholas Carter told MPs the behaviour of the Libyan cadets was 'beyond the pale' David Cameron today hit out at the 'completely unacceptable' breakdown of discipline among Libyan soldiers in Cambridgeshire . Around 200 UK soldiers were involved in the training but a further 100 had to be drafted in last week to provide reinforcements while police patrols have been stepped up following allegations of a male rape and sexual attacks on three women in Cambridge. Five cadets are in police custody facing sex charges after a series of violations described by Mr Cameron as ‘totally unacceptable’. The head of the army today admitted the behaviour of Libyan soldiers who went on the rampage outside their barracks  was 'beyond the pale'. General Sir Nicholas Carter's remarks came after an angry David Cameron demanded military top brass explain the 'unacceptable' breakdown of discipline  which saw hundreds of Libyan cadets sent home in disgrace amid allegations of rape, drunkenness, fighting and theft. The Prime Minister said the the Government programme to train up Libya's army would be scrapped and all the trainees based in Britain deported. On their way home: 300 Libyan troops training at  Bassingbourn Barracks in Cambridgeshire (pictured) have been sent back early following alleged sex attacks . Two thousand Libyan cadets – hand-picked by the British Army – were supposed to be given leadership skills in the UK to help their war-torn country. Toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi has allowed an ‘even worse’ regime to take over, Ukip’s Mark Reckless has claimed. Mr Reckless, the party’s candidate in Rochester and Strood in the upcoming by-election, said Gaddafi had been good at controlling immigration. The former MP, who defected from the Conservative party in September, said African migrants were being ‘waved through Italy’ and then headed for Calais to cross the Channel for Britain. Mr Reckless was speaking at a public meeting in Rochester, where UKIP is hoping to win its second seat in the House of Commons. The issue of immigration is becoming a key battleground for the General Election. He said: ‘Whatever people say about Gaddafi, one thing is he didn't allow those boats to come across. ‘He had an agreement with Italy that stopped it. Since he's gone we've no idea what's going on in Libya, it's too dangerous for anyone to go there.’ He said that since Gaddafi’s regime had fallen the ‘bad guys’ were being replaced by ‘even worse guys’. He added: ‘We bombed them, that's what we did. That's how this government helped Libya. It got rid of somebody, albeit an Arab nationalist dictator, who actually gave a level of stability to the area.’ But the scheme has been beset by difficulties from the start - with trainees allowed to run amok outside their barracks in Cambridgeshire. At Prime Minister’s Questions today, Mr Cameron told MPs what had happened at Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire, was ‘completely unacceptable’. He said: ‘These are criminal actions and I’ve asked fort the chief of the defence staff to look into this.’ Mr Cameron said the training had been scrapped altogether, adding: ‘The trainees will be returning to Libya in the coming days. In the meantime all unescorted visits from the camp have been stopped altogether.’ Since the training course began in June, Libyan cadets hunted down and sexually assaulted three women in one night - while another two  trainees have been charged with raping a man in a park. General discipline collapsed, with one in ten refusing to obey orders - with one UK trainer reportedly headbutted and another apparently threatened by a Libyan mob. General Carter told MPs the alleged attacks were ‘completely beyond the pale’ and ‘absolutely regrettable’ as he appeared before the Commons defence select committee. But the Chief of the General Staff said: ‘The Bassingbourn site is not a prison camp. It is extraordinarily difficult to control it, in that sense.’ He added that he knew some of the Libyans had sought political asylum. Asked if thought that was appropriate, he replied: ‘No, probably not.’ To add further insult it has emerged that the Libyan government still owe millions of pounds for the training of their soldiers. In April, Mr Cameron wrote to Mr Zidan’s successor, Abdullah al-Thinni, urging him to make the payments. The Prime Minister pledged the UK’s continuing support but added: ‘I understand that you have been working personally to take forward the General Purpose Force Programme and that plans are now advanced for some 360 recruits to come to the UK in May. ‘I hope that it will be possible to resolve quickly the remaining issues relating to contract and payment, given the overall importance of this programme to our shared goal of improving stability and security.’ The call for extra troops to restore order came from police last week. Units of the 2 Scots, the Royal Highland Fusiliers, were sent in to Bassingbourn Barracks, near Royston, after their leave was cancelled. Last night, the Ministry of Defence announced the 24-week course was ending early and the 325 cadets would be sent home. The future of the entire programme – scheduled to cover 2,000 trainees – is in doubt amid protests from furious locals. One of the Libyan cadets due to be sent home blamed Britain yesterday for the difficulties at the Bassingbourn Barracks, claiming ‘they didn’t tell us the difference between what’s right and wrong here’. Omar Al-Mukhtar, who is not one of the men accused of the assaults, added: ‘They didn’t tell us about British law.’ He alleged that when trainees had been allowed out on accompanied visits of three hours a week they had been offered drugs, alcohol and sex for money. He did not say who by. Asked if the recruits had a message for the British government he said: ‘Not to take things too seriously.’ Speaking to the BBC, Mr Al-Mukhtar said he and other Libyans were proud to have graduated from the course at Bassingbourn, and were very happy with the training they received. But some cadets were unhappy with life on the base and how they had been treated, claiming ‘people’ were out to ruin the reputation of the Libyan army. Mr Al-Mukhtar alleged that when the cadets were arrested and their comrades went to ask authorities at the base what was happening, they were given no information. He said the cadets believed the arrested men were ‘unlawfully treated’, adding: ‘We blame the British authorities.’ He admitted there had been a ‘small fight’ between cadets but far more between Libyan and British soldiers. Andrew Lansley, a former Tory health secretary who had initially supported the scheme, said: ‘As this stands, no further groups of trainees could be brought here from Libya.’ He said the MoD must be held accountable for ‘a serious failure’. Mr Lansley said about 10 per cent of the cadets ‘were not accepting the discipline and weren’t accepting what they were asked to do and were not becoming part of a military force’. ‘They were looking to take whatever advantage they could,’ he added. ‘It has meant recently that there has been a lot of additional resources by the MoD to try and shore it up and give protection. It is all very disappointing. We wanted it to work and for it to make a contribution in Libya. I am unhappy.’ The demand for answers came after Cambridge magistrates were told how three of the cadets had behaved ‘like a pack’ as they hunted down and sexually assaulted three women in one night. Ibrahim Naji El Maarfi, 20, and Mohammed Abdalsalam, 27, left their barracks on stolen bicycles and cycled to Cambridge where they stalked their victims under the cover of darkness. The city’s magistrates were told how they touched them sexually and attempted to put their hands up their skirts. El Maarfi pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault, one count of exposure and one count of theft. They will be sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court at a later date. A third man, Khaled El Azibi, 18, who was charged with three counts of sexual assault and one count of theft,is yet to enter a plea. In another incident, Moktar Ali Saad Mahmoud, 33, and Ibrahim Abogutila, 22, have been charged with the rape of a man in a Cambridge park. An estimated £2.5million was spent refurbishing Bassingbourn to host the series of courses conducted by members of 3 Scots, the Black Watch. Peter Robinson, who chairs the parish council, said: ‘I thought Muslims didn’t drink but there has been a run on vodka in the local shop. That’s their favourite trip – going to the Spar and then stealing bicycles.’ Downing Street confirmed that the Libyan soldiers are eligible to seek asylum in the UK before they are kicked out. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘Asylum rules apply to everyone. It will be the existing asylum rules that apply.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","General Sir Nicholas Carter attacked behaviour of Libyan cadets in UK .

"Warning: Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has warned there could already be as many as 200 return jihadis in London . There could already be as many as 200 returned jihadis in London alone, Britain’s most senior policeman has warned. Speaking yesterday, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe also added his voice to those calling for terrorists who go abroad to fight to be stripped of their UK passports. And he called for the return of the controversial control orders which were used to tightly restrict the movement and behaviour of terror suspects. The orders were replaced in 2011 by less restrictive measures, but with more than 500 Britons said to be fighting for Islamic State and other militant groups in Syria and Iraq – and 250 said to have returned to the UK – Sir Bernard said the ‘drum beat has changed’. Speaking on LBC radio, he said: ‘Certainly for us anything that either stops them from going or preferably stops them from coming back is a good idea. ‘If it works, we should do that. It seems to me it’s a privilege to have a passport and be a citizen of this country, and if you’re going to start fighting in another country on behalf of another state, or against another state, it seems to me that you’ve made a choice about where you what to be.’ And he warned the real number of ‘militarised’ jihadi fighters back in the country could exceed the official estimate of 250. UK militants have adopted an increasingly high profile in Syria, posting sickening pictures of corpses and beheadings on social media. The murderer of US journalist James Foley, 40, who was beheaded as part of an IS video, is thought by voice experts to be from London or the south-east. Sir Bernard said the force is working with American counterparts to firmly establish whether the murderer is British. Calling for a return of ‘something like’ the abolished control orders – which enabled the authorities to tell terror suspects where to live and place them under lengthy curfews – he added: ‘They were stopped because the threat was reduced and quite properly they were seen as too intrusive. Sickening video: The murderer of US journalist James Foley, 40, who was beheaded as part of an IS video (pictured), is thought by voice experts to be from London or the south-east . ‘But I think these things have got to be considered when the drum beat changes, and it’s clear that the drum beat has changed.’ Earlier this week Boris Johnson said those who ‘continue to give allegiance to a terrorist state’ should lose their British citizenship, and the law should be changed so there is a ‘rebuttable presumption’ that those visiting war areas without notifying the authorities had done so for a terrorist purpose. Sir Bernard – who also said that there had been ‘too much sensitivity’ over tackling hate preachers on the streets of Britain – added: ‘The big thing for us, that we have talked about, is if we can get an assumption that when people come back and they have been to Syria, they have been involved in terrorism – if they can prove they haven’t then it’s up to them.’ Speaking out: Earlier this week Boris Johnson (pictured) said those who ‘continue to give allegiance to a terrorist state’ should lose their British citizenship .","Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe says threat posed by UK terrorists has soared .

"A report by the Centre for Social Justice has said more than 1,000 adults and children were trafficked into or within the UK in 2011/2012 (file picture posed by model) A teenage girl was raped 90 times in one weekend it has been revealed, in a shocking report into modern-day slavery in the UK. The report, due to be published tomorrow by the Centre for Social Justice, contains evidence from the girl, who was 16 at the time she was taken into slavery and raped by 90 men. The girl, who gave evidence to the committee despite still being 'deeply traumatised' by the attacks, did not come from a background which put her at risk, but became enslaved after befriending girls vulnerable to abuse, it has been reported. Andrew Wallis, chairman of the working group that produced the report, would only tell the committee the girl 'is now safe' when asked what had happened to her since the attacks, according to the Sunday Times. The report claims efforts to tackle modern slavery in the UK, including the sexual exploitation of children, are in a state of crisis. The CSJ, an independent think-tank set up by Iain Duncan Smith, has attacked the Government for its 'inadequate response' to the issue after the investigation uncovered a 'shocking underworld' of human trafficking. Its study found more than 1,000 adults and children were trafficked into or within the UK in 2011/2012, but the figure could be 'only the tip of the iceberg'. Among the cases were British and foreign victims who had been forced into the sex trade, a life of crime or domestic labour. British girls trafficked within Britain for the sex trade made up nearly one half of all UK slavery victims in the latest set of figures. Christian Guy, managing director of the CSJ, said: 'Our research has uncovered a shocking underworld in which children and adults, many of them UK citizens, have been forced into lives of utter degradation. 'Yet the authorities are either failing to understand the nature of this abuse or turning a blind eye to its existence. Our once great nation of abolitionists is a shameful shadow of its former self.' The think-tank is campaigning for a radical overhaul of measures to combat 21st century slavery, including bringing all human trafficking and modern slavery offences together. The report is to be published by the independent think-tank the Centre for Social Justice, which was set up by Iain Duncan Smith . It added that victims should be encouraged to come forward without the threat of facing prosecution over immigration breaches or crimes they have committed since being trafficked. More training is also needed to ensure police officers, immigration officials and social workers recognise the scale and nature of the problem. Nine Asian men were jailed last year for between four and 19 years for grooming young white girls in and around the town of Rochdale. The men picked them up from the school gates and took them to houses and flats to be plied with alcohol and drugs before being passed around for sex. Forty-seven children were identified as victims of the exploitation that left many of their lives in tatters. The victims were vulnerable teenagers from deprived, dysfunctional backgrounds who were targeted in 'honeypot locations' where young people regularly congregated, such as takeaway food shops. All the girls were coerced and bribed into keeping quiet about the abuse through a combination of free alcohol and drugs, food, small sums of money and other gifts. Although some of the victims willingly had sex with their abusers, others were physically assaulted and raped by as many as five men at a time. Mr Guy said: 'We have been alarmed to learn that British children being trafficked within the country are often viewed as somehow being complicit in their exploitation. This is absurd and unacceptable. 'Elements of control in these cases can be subtle and difficult to identify; this control frequently takes the form of sexual and other forms of violence, physical or emotional abuse, threats of violence towards family members or threats of public shaming.' A spokeswoman for the Home Office said the Government has already made significant progress in fighting trafficking. She said: 'Human trafficking is abhorrent and the UK Government is committed to combating this crime in all its forms. 'Investment in training for front line professionals to identify and refer victims, improvements in data collection, work with the private sector to protect workers and more personalised care and support for victims are already making a real difference. 'But the Government is not complacent and we will continue to work to improve and strengthen our approach to keep pace with emerging threats.'","Girl gave evidence to committee despite still being 'deeply traumatised'

"Claims: High School math teacher Joyce Quiller was fired after allegedly calling her students the n-word . A math teacher who was fired this year for allegedly calling her students 'n*****s' may be re-hired after a judge ruled the school district didn't follow the proper steps in her termination. Joyce Quiller, 51, taught math to at-risk students at Jean Ribault High School in Jacksonville, Florida when she got her termination letter last February. A judge last month ruled that the Duval School District violated Quiller's union contract by firing her, instead of first putting her on suspension without pay. 'The School Board skipped step three and went directly to termination even though, if the allegations were true, they would have amounted to what is considered a minor offense,' Reginal Luster, Quiller's legal consultant, told WJXT. 'Not some type of severe misconduct on behalf of Ms Quiller. It does not warrant the termination.' The school board will meet next week to discuss what to do about the judge's ruling. According to a document detailing the January investigation, seven students in the 10th and 11th grade came forward to say Quiller used derogatory language to belittle them. Quiller worked as a math teacher in the Bridge to Success program, which aims at helping at-risk students. One student described the moment Quiller berated a group of boys after they walked into the classroom, saying: 'You all are some lazy n****** for coming to class late.' Another student, who had Quiller for Algebra 2 and Geometry, says she frequently called him the offensive name. 'You are like the rest of these n*****s, now you want to come to school and do your work,' she said to that student on one occasion. Other students say she has called them 'stupid' and 'ignorant' and has used other curse words in class. Quiller taught at-risk youths at Jean Ribault High School in Jacksonville, Florida before her dismissal. A judge ruled last month that the school district did not follow the proper steps in firing the teacher . A student who forgot to bring a pencil to class says Quiller told him. 'What is the point in coming to the mother-f****** class if you do not bring materials?' However, Quiller's legal counsel says the judge found  the allegations 'not credible at all'. Though Quiller has not issued a statement following the judge's decision, she denied using the n-word in class in the January report. She wrote that as an African-American she 'praised herself in being intelligent and classy', and does not refer to herself or call people of color the n-word. She went on to say she doesn't understand why the assistant principal has a 'vendetta' against her. Indeed, Quiller had on three prior occasions been given a written or verbal warning about her language in the presence of students dating back to 2001, according to the report. In a post on her Facebook page in June, Quiller said she was hired at 'PHCA' which may stand for the Potter's House Christian Academy in Jacksonville, . According to a Facebook post in June, Quiller has since found another job. An administrator at the Potter's House Christian Academy would neither confirm nor deny Quiller working there . MailOnline called the private school on Tuesday, but an administrator would neither confirm or deny that Quiller was employed there. The Duval School Board plans to vote next week on whether to rehire Quiller as a teacher. Quiller's attorney with the teacher's union says the school board may find a legal reason not to follow the judge's decision. And even if they do re-hire her, they could fire her again following the steps outlined in her union contract. 'Since there are so many outstanding issues, Ms Quiller wants to respect the process and is not in a position to make a comment at this time,' Quiller said in a statement through a representative. She added that she is eager to get back in the classroom.","Joyce Quiller was fired as a teacher at Jean Ribault High School last February .

The spat reportedly started when Stiviano, who is Mexican and African American, posted a photo of herself and Magic Johnson on her Instagram page. 'It bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you’re associating with black people. Do you have to?' Sterling is heard saying. 'I’m just saying, in your lousy f******* Instagrams, you don’t have to have yourself with, walking with black people. 'Don't put him (Johnson) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me.  And don't bring him to my games.' The photo with Johnson has reportedly been taken down and Stiviano has locked it so that her Instagram feed is private. She . and Sterling, who is still legally married but has been separated from . his wife Shelly for years, appear to have an open relationship. Racist history: Clippers owner Donald Sterling who has twice been sued for refusing to rent apartments to minorities, is seen shaking hands with Reggie Evans of the Brooklyn Nets in 2013 . At several points on the tape, the 81-year-old billionaire claims that he is not racist but does not understand why his girlfriend wants to publicize her relationships with people of color. Magic . Johnson, who retired from the Los Angeles Lakers in 1991 and returned . for a single season in 1996, spoke out against the comments and said . that he will never attend another Clippers game while Sterling is the . owner. 'I . feel sorry for my friends Coach Doc Rivers and Chris Paul that they . have to work for a man that feels that way about African Americans,' he . wrote on Twitter, citing some current Clippers players. Legend: Magic Johnson used to play in the same stadium that the Clippers use when he was a member of the LA Lakers . 'LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling's comments about African Americans are a black eye for the NBA.' He expanded on his thoughts to TMZ, saying that he does not think the players should boycott but the fans should. 'He wants our money but doesn't want us to show up,' Johnson said. 'I thought we were friends. We've broken bread together several times. It's almost like, do you smile in my face but behind my back you talk about me? I'd have felt better in 1979 if you would have just told me you don't like African Americans, and then I would have known how to deal with you. 'He has to step down or sell the team.' The recording has prompted calls for a boycott of the team by the NBA and fans alike- including former sports broadcaster Keith Olberman and Snoop Dogg, who posted an expletive-laced video on his Instagram account.

He was sued twice by the federal government after refusing to rent apartments to minorities. In the 2005 case, he was ordered to pay a $2.73million fine to settle. In . a 2009 case, he was accused of refusing to rent to non-Koreans when it . came to a property in Koreatown and refused African American tenants for . a property in Beverly Hills. He was reportedly accused of saying that he wouldn't rent to Hispanics because they 'smoke, drink and just hang around the building'. The suit also accused Sterling of saying 'Black tenants smell and attract vermin'. He was also named in a 2003 lawsuit wherein he crudely described how he had sex with a prostitute who charged $500-per-tryst. In that case, he admitted that 'maybe I morally did something wrong' but went on to explain that 'it was purely sex for money, money for sex, sex for money, money for sex,' according to records obtained by The Smoking Gun. The conversation is allegedly between Donald Sterling and his girlfriend, who goes by the name V. Stiviano, who identifies herself as part Mexican and part African American.

"Ebola fears have infected a medical conference on the subject. Louisiana state health officials told thousands of doctors planning to attend a tropical diseases meeting this weekend in New Orleans to stay away if they have been to certain African countries or have had contact with an Ebola patient in the last 21 days. The order came in a letter Wednesday to the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, which made clear it did not agree with the decision. Several doctors, including some from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, now may not be able to attend or present studies at the meeting, which runs Sunday through Wednesday. The letter acknowledges that even people infected with the Ebola virus do not spread the disease unless they are showing symptoms. Ebola fears: Louisiana state health officials told thousands of doctors planning to attend a tropical diseases meeting this weekend in New Orleans to stay away if they have been to certain African countries . But it says that because people with a travel or exposure history to Ebola should avoid large group settings, 'we see no utility in you traveling to New Orleans to simply be confined to your room.' It is signed by Kathy Kliebert, secretary of the state's Department of Health & Hospitals, and Kevin Davis, director of the Governor's Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Preparedness. It cites travel within the last 21 days — Ebola's maximum incubation period — to Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone as being a problem. The tropical medicine group noted that the state's stance goes beyond CDC guidelines. Its president, Dr. Alan Magill, called the order 'unfortunate' and 'a pretty tough message to send out, particularly to our international colleagues,' who were gathering to share knowledge on how to beat back Ebola and other global health problems. 'We certainly have folks who know this disease very well and we were looking forward to having world experts discuss it,' said Magill, also an official at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates is to speak at the conference's opening session on Sunday. Magill said he did not know how many of the 3,500 registered for the conference would now not be able to attend, but added, ""I'm sure some people will choose not to come out of protest"" to Louisiana's stance. Meeting site: Several doctors, including some from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, now may not be able to attend or present studies at the meeting at the Sheraton . 'I don't agree with it at all,' said Dr. John Schieffelin, an infectious diseases expert at Tulane University in New Orleans who will attend the conference. He just published a study in this week's New England Journal of Medicine giving the most detailed information yet on symptoms and treatment of Ebola cases in Sierra Leone, and returned from that country in August. 'It's just one more thing that's going to slow down the science and research effort' and ultimately could hurt control of the disease, Schieffelin said of the state's policy. It's an overreaction to perceived risk and ""comes off as a little xenophobic,"" he said. In contrast to the Louisiana situation, there were no such restrictions placed on doctors attending the American College of Emergency Physicians' annual meeting in Chicago this week, said Julie Lloyd, a spokeswoman for the group.","Louisiana state health officials told thousands of Ebola doctors planning to attend a tropical diseases meeting this weekend in New Orleans to stay away .

"Michael Sam was not picked up by any other team Sunday after the NFL's first openly gay draft pick was cut by the St. Louis Rams. Sam's dreams of becoming the first gay NFL player have now been placed on hold. Undeterred, the player who has not been picked up by any other NFL team, posted a message to social media. 'The most worthwhile things in life rarely come easy, this is a lesson I've always known. The journey continues.' His boyfriend, Vito Cammisano, also showed his support for Sam by tweeted a picture of the couple together, wearing shirts from the University of Missouri, where they both attended college. Scroll down for video . Support: Vito Cammisano uploaded this picture of boyfriend, Michael Sam, on Saturday, after the NFL player was cut by the Rams during pre-season . Cut: The St. Louis Rams released defensive end Michael Sam on Saturday, smashing his hopes of becoming the first openly gay player in NFL history. He was not subsequently picked up by another team . Sam showed up for his face-to-face exit meeting with St. Louis Rams coach Jeff Fisher, a few hours after clearing waivers. Sam arrived at Rams Park via through the media entrance Sunday afternoon still looking right at home clad in T-shirt, shorts and flip flips. He shook hands with two reporters and accepted well wishes but declined further comment before heading upstairs to see the coach who wasn't afraid to add the first openly gay player to the roster. All 21 players released Saturday cleared waivers. Sam's future was a major topic on Twitter, some of it vitriol, some reasoned. The Rams appeared unlikely to re-sign Sam to the 10-player practice squad because the defensive line is their strongest unit and they need help elsewhere. The meeting with Sam meeting was postponed a day so he could attend Missouri's opening victory over South Dakota State. The 7th-round draft pick has been outspoken and confident as his progress was watched as closely as any rookie in the league. He has been cheered by athletes and celebrities. In the end, the defensive end couldn't make a team stocked with pass-rushers. The news was first reported by ESPN. Sam still has a chance to get picked up by another team or to make the Rams' practice squad. On Saturday, he attended Missouri's opener in Columbia, a 1 1/2-hour drive west on I-70 from Rams Park. He was introduced to the crowd at the cut down deadline in the end zone alongside defensive E.J. Gaines, a sixth-round pick who made the team. Sam blew a kiss and waved to the crowd, then walked back to the sideline. He posed for a few pictures then started looking at his phone and headed for the locker room. The Rams selected Sam, the SEC co-defensive player of the year at Missouri, with the 249th overall pick out of 256 overall during May's draft. Sam came out following his final season at Missouri. Historic: Sam, who came out in the months leading up to his drafting, celebrated with his boyfriend Vito Cammisanoon live television when he got the girl of his initial selection in May. However ESPN received complaints about airing a kiss between the pair . The call: Both Sam and his boyfriend Vito Cammisano cried tears of joy as they received the good news of his drafting in May . Rams coach Jeff Fisher was proud to have made the landmark pick, but he made clear from the start that he chose Sam because he thought he had the talent to make it. The Rams selected Sam, the SEC co-defensive player of the year at Missouri, with the 249th overall pick out of 256 overall. He kissed his boyfriend as a national television audience looked on, and arrived brimming with confidence and with a quick retort for anyone who contended he was in the NFL only because he came out. The cameras followed, but the extra attention did not seem to faze Sam or his teammates. Veteran defensive end Chris Long noted rosters are always made up of players from different backgrounds. One by one, players said Sam was now part of their family. Coach Jeff Fisher called the draft pick a 'second historic moment' for a franchise that signed running back Kenny Washington in 1946 as the league's first black player in the modern era, but he was most interested in describing Sam as a way to upgrade the Rams' defense. So was general manager Les Snead, who referred to Sam after the draft as a 'designated pass rusher'. Sam recognized the challenge, so he shed weight to be faster for special teams duty, reporting at 257 pounds. After the Rams' first preseason game, a 26-24 loss to New Orleans, Fisher said Sam played 'pretty well' but also made his share of mistakes. Sam, who was credited with one tackle and one quarterback hit in the game, emerged with confidence. 'You know, I can play in this league,' Sam said. 'I can play in this league.' Sam told his teammates at Missouri that he was gay before his senior year, and judging by the results it was no distraction at all. Dreams on hold: Sam still has a chance of being picked up by another team, despite being cut by the Rams. The Rams may still choose him for practice squad . The Tigers made a seven-win improvement and tied the school record with 12 wins. Sam had 11 1/2 sacks and the lightly-regarded Tigers won the SEC Eastern Division, a huge step forward after going 5-7 during the first season in their new conference. More than 100 coaches and players kept the revelation to themselves. Sam came out in February. 'If you look at our season, it didn't hurt us at all,' recalled cornerback E.J. Gaines, a fellow rookie and former Missouri teammate. 'If anything, it brought us closer.' Sam was lightly regarded out of Hitchcock, Texas, a town of about 7,000 along the Gulf Coast about 40 miles southeast of Houston. His first two years at Missouri, Sam backed up Aldon Smith and Jacquies Smith, both of whom are in the NFL. The Rams drafted Sam even though they didn't need help at defensive end, where they have a pair of first-round picks as starters. The Rams were so well-stocked with picks, taking 11 players overall, they had leeway to take a shot. Fisher said Sam's value as a player 'was off the charts'. Michael Sam, the first openly gay athlete drafted into the NFL, was cut by the St. Louis Rams as the team trimmed its roster ahead of the start of the 2014 season . 'I'm determined to be great,' Sam said at his introductory news conference, packed with reporters. 'I understand that right now you guys want to make a big deal of it.' From the start, teammates seemed to like having Sam around. His energy was infectious and, if there were problems, they stayed behind closed doors. Publicly, Sam was just another late-round pick trying to make the Rams, which, like other NFL teams, held sensitivity training early in camp. The Oprah Winfrey Network put off a planned documentary on Sam, saying it would allow him to focus on his dream of making the team. At one point, Sam's Rams jersey was the No. 2 seller among rookies at NFLShop.com, trailing only Cleveland's Johnny Manziel, and Sam was among just 10 draftees selected by the NFL to be featured on commemorative coins. Sam headed to the ESPY Awards to pick up the Arthur Ashe Courage award. He got a hug from Hall of Famer Jim Brown on his way to the stage and fought back tears throughout his speech. 'Great things can happen when you have the courage to be yourself,' he told the audience.","Michael Sam, 24, was the first openly gay athlete drafted into the NFL .

"Haji Gulalainow, a former Afghan spy services chief, now lives in a two-storey pink house in a Los Angeles suburbs with his family . During the height of his tenure as Afghanistan's notorious 'torturer-in-chief' he was feared by his victims, subjecting them to electric shocks and vicious beatings. But now Haji Gulalai, the former head of Afghan spy services, has allegedly forged a new life in Southern California, where he is said to occupy a pink, two-storey stucco house in a quiet Los Angeles suburb. Gulalai, now in his early 60s, was once a key figure in the Afghanistan war -  'a big wheel in a machine that ground up a lot of people', the Washington Post reports. In Kandahar he ran the spy services operations following the US-led invasion in 2001. How he left behind that brutal career in Afghanistan and landed in L.A. - in an area that is said to remind him of the dry heat and landscape of Kandahar - is unclear. Gulalai . was able to bypass immigration barriers faced by Afghans whose work for . the United States made them potential targets of the Taliban, the paper reports. Despite links to the United States intelligence services, the CIA denied aiding his entry. He . was among a group of Pashtuns who were chosen to try and seize the . Taliban stronghold, and had previously been involved in CIA-backed . efforts to oust Soviet forces. Gulalai, whose real name is Kamal . Achakzai, went on to lead the National Directorate of Security (NDS), . which was funded by U.S. intelligence agencies and faced allegations of . human rights abuses. New life: Gulalai, then an Afghan intelligence chief, is in sunglasses to the right of Afghan President Hamid Karzai in 2002 . A secret memo from 2007 named Gulalai as the main culprit behind the the NDS's 'systematic' torturing. It said he was 'personally involved in conducting beatings amounting to torture, in . detaining suspects illegally and arbitrarily and in deliberately and . systematically evading detention monitoring.' His methods were said to include sleep . deprivation for as long as 13 days and would suspend inmates from the . ceiling with handcuffs. Some claimed his extreme tactics even pushed neutral Afghans towards enemy factions. However his supporters have said his job was crucial to the protection of the city. In the Southern California community he now allegedly calls home, Gulalai is said to be surrounded by a network of Afghans. The front yard of his L.A. property has a locked gate, is surrounded by a white fence and has citrus trees scattered around it. Bashir Wasifi, who attended school with Gulalai in the 1960s before moving to the California in 1979 said: 'We see each other every weekend, we play cards together.' 'His position was a cruel position so he did cruel things, but he is not like that.' He claimed the former officer arrived with more than a dozen of his relatives. Similarities: The former intelligence chief is said to be fond of the Los Angeles suburbs because it reminds him of the landscape surrounding the city where he grew up . Conditions: He is also said to like the 'dry heat' at his new home because of its likeness to Kandahar (pictured) Oppositon: Retired General John R Allen stopped prison transfers to the NDS because of fears over human rights abuses . Since he has settled in the community, he is said to have learned little English and is unemployed. Neighbours said he lives with a number of children, ranging in age from toddlers to someone in their twenties. Since he has moved, the UN have begun a more comprehensive investigation into the methods used by the NDS. Retired Marine General John R. Allen suspended prisoner transfers to the . security service after reports of abuse, and said the organisation . relied on torture as an institutional 'reflex'. During his time as a leading . intelligence official, he was said to have operated under a 'culture of . impunity' because of his link to international organisations. The Taliban tried to kill him on . numerous occasions and supporting factions tried to remove him from his post. He was nearly fired twice from the NDS, after UN Officials tried to persuade the then head Armullah Saleh to fire him. But . the orders were not followed because of ethnic politics and he was . subsequently promoted and ended up in charge of the main prison in . Kabul.","Haji Gulalai would subject victims to electric shocks and vicious beatings .

"Controversial: Sean Stone has voiced his support for Iran and sympathy for Middle Easterners who question Jewish settlers' ties to the land of Israel . Actor Sean Stone, the son of renowned director Oliver Stone, has said he believes 9/11 was 'probably an inside job' and questions the real threat of so-called terrorists. The 28-year-old, who converted to Islam last year, has described the Quran as a 'very sensible book' and explained why he thinks Middle Easterners oppose European Jews settling in Israel. The young actor appears to be following in the footsteps, to some extent, of his father Oliver Stone, who has in the past rallied against what he has called Israel's 'powerful lobby in Washington'. In his latest interview, Sean Stone told a reporter at Russia Today, Russia's English-language television network, that '9/11 was probably an inside job of some kind, that it was not simply a rag-tag group of terrorists led by bin Laden who conducted this operation'. The subsequent 'war on terror' that ensued, Mr Stone described as 'over a decade of constant fear mongering and aggression'. The actor, who has appeared in many of his father's films including Nixon, Natural Born Killers and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, says the information fed to us about 'boogeyman terrorists' - whether from Russia, North Korea or Muslims - is 'propaganda'. 'What is that system? It's a cycle of fear that has to be broken internally,' he says. Meanwhile, the younger Stone questions what difference there is between suicide bombers and covert drones dropping missiles. In a previous interview, Mr Stone has said Iran's outgoing president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was 'misunderstood' and has also now said the idea of Iran funding a terrorist organisation in Hezbollah is an 'exaggeration' He said: 'Because we killed them with our missiles we don't consider ourselves terrorists. We only consider those who blow themselves up terrorists. And obviously you cannot create that qualification. That's a 1984 Orwellian double speak term.' He described the whole concept of terrorism as 'quite insane'. The actor then went on to voice his views on Iran, saying he believed the idea of the country as a 'great terrorist enemy' is 'not true'. 'They're very civilised people. They have a 3,000-year history. They are not looking to destroy themselves in the process of a war against... Israel unless there's a good motivation to do so.' The 28-year-old actor said in the RT interview that he believed the 9/11 attacks were 'probably and inside job' and questioned the ability of a 'rag-tag' group led by bin Laden to carry it out . In the RT interview, which has been picked up by Yahoo News, Mr Stone says it's 'debatable' whether Hezbollah is a terrorist organisation'. The Lebanon-based group, which is funded and trained by Iran, is considered to be 'defenders of the Lebanese sovereignty' since they operate within Lebanon's borders, he says. The young actor appears to be following somewhat in the footsteps of his father, director Oliver Stone, who has campaigned against Jewish lobby groups in the U.S. He adds he thinks it's an 'exaggeration' to say Iran is a 'terrorist sponsor' and points out that Lebanon has been invaded by Israel numerous times. On the subject of Israel, he is sympathetic with Middle Easterners' view of the country as a 'crusader state'. He says when they see European or Russian Jews coming to Israel to settle, they question what ties they have to the land. He says: 'Now, I'm not a proponent of attacking Israel or trying to dissolve it at this point, but I'm simply saying that that is why there's so much antagonism to Israel.' The RT interview can be seen at the end of this RT news video.","Sean Stone converted to Islam last year while working on a film in Iran .

"An annual dance thrown by the Queen for staff at her Balmoral residence has been put back a day as she anxiously awaits the result of the referendum. Held by successive monarchs since the days of Queen Victoria, the dance is one of the highlights of the royal calendar and traditionally is held on Thursday of this week each year. Now estate managers have postponed the dance until Friday so that estate workers have the chance to cast their vote. Scroll down for video . The Queen has decided to delay the traditional annual ball by one day so members of the estate can vote . Buckingham Palace has insisted the monarch is remaining determinedly neutral over the referendum . The Queen's deep love of Scotland is well known, with Balmoral Castle (pictured) her favourite residence . But locals are already asking whether the ball will turn out to be a celebration - or a wake. The party is held in the Ballroom of Balmoral Castle, the largest room in Queen’s private and most beloved residence, which is decorated with Highland scenes by Landseer and Carl Haag as well as silver statues by Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm. Invitations to the Ghillies Ball are hugely sought after – sent to estate staff, a handful of the Queen’s closest neighbours on Royal Deeside and notable members of the local community. Unlike other royal functions, the sovereign and members of her family – which this year include Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Princess Anne and Prince Andrew – mingle and dance Scottish reels arm-in-arm with their guests, washed down with copious amounts of punch. Few pictures exist of the exclusive Ghillies Ball but the Queen has always enjoyed a party (left at a film premier in 1957 and right during a dance on the crowed floor at The Royal Caledonian Ball in 1946) ‘It’s the most exclusive ball in the world because you cannot go there unless you are staff or, of course, a member of the royal family,’ one estate worker said yesterday. ‘You might even find yourself dancing with the Queen. ‘It’s quite a big ceilidh, with pipers and plenty of music, and is usually held this Thursday.’ Royal sources confirmed to the Mail that the dance had indeed been moved because of the vote. (L-R) The Duke of Edinburgh,  Prince Andrew, Prince Charles, the Queen, Prince Edward and Princess Anne in front of the Queen's beloved Balmoral Castle, Scotland during the Royal Family's summer holiday in 1972 . ‘It’s the biggest event during the Queen’s summer stay at Balmoral each year and has been in the diary for some considerable time,’ said one. ‘When it became clear that that it would clash with the date of the referendum, it was put back a day until Friday so that that staff and those involved with the estate could vote.’ Although Royal Deeside is considered to be very much a pro-Union area, several ‘Yes’ posters have been spotted outside homes and shops in the vicinity of the castle in recent days. The royal fgamily have long loved a Highland knees-up. Pictured is the Queen Mother, wearing the Stuart tartan sash over her evening dress, takes part in the dashing white sergeant at the 111th Royal Caledonian Ball at Grosvenor House . While Buckingham Palace has insisted the monarch is remaining determinedly neutral over the issue, her remark to a well-wisher outside church on Sunday urging people to ‘think very carefully about the referendum this week’ has been seized on by the No campaign. Many campaigners have interpreted her words as clear support for keeping Scotland in the UK. Last week aides released a statement saying that any suggestion the Queen would want to influence the referendum result is ‘categorically wrong’ and she would continually to remain politically neutral as she is required to constitutionally. ‘Her Majesty is simply of the view that this is a matter for the people of Scotland,’ Buckingham Palace said.","Ghillies Ball is traditionally held on Thursday of this week each year .

"A Florida congressman has accused his wife of bigamy after almost 24 years of marriage. U.S. Representative Alan Grayson said in divorce papers filed last week that his wife Lolita was married to another man when she married the congressman in 1990. Grayson says he was unaware that his wife was still married when they tied the knot. Alan Grayson, a liberal Democrat from the Orlando, Florida area claims that his wife Lolita (left) is a bigamist who was already married when they tied the knot in 1990 . The Democrat says his wife, who was born in the Philippines, secretly divorced her other husband in 1994. An attorney for Lolita Grayson, Mercedes Wechsler, wouldn't comment on the court papers on Tuesday. Earlier this year, Lolita Grayson accused her husband of pushing her during a confrontation at their home but sheriff's investigators found no probable cause to charge him. In March, Lolita Grayson was granted a restraining order against her husband. She alleged that Grayson pushed her against the front door of their home when he stopped by the house. Grayson's lawyers later released a video showing his estranged wife shoving him in front of their house but doesn't reveal the congressman slamming his wife against a door as she claimed. The video, shot by a staffer for the congressman, shows Lolita Grayson walking from a red minivan parked in front of their home, pointing her finger and shouting. The video then cuts to the congressman and his wife arguing at the front door to the house. It then shows Lolita Grayson pushing her hand at her estranged husband's face. Alan Grayson was at the house to visit his children. The Graysons have five children and the congressman is seeking parental responsibility for the four who are still minors. Grayson was ranked as the 11th richest person in Congress in 2010, based on financial disclosure forms with a net worth of $31.4million, according to rollcall.com. His largest asset was a claim against the now-defunct Derivium Capital for at least $25 million. The Florida lawmaker also reported a trust valued at $5 -$25 million with no debts. In the early Nineties, Grayson founded law firm Grayson & Kubli, which concentrated on government contract law. He is known as a Democratic firebrand . in the House of Representatives. Last October his re-election campaign . emailed a fundraising solicitation that compared the conservative tea . party to the Ku Klux Klan. A burning cross took the place of the 'T' in 'Tea Party.'

"A stranded piglet had to be rescued by firefighters after wandering into the middle of a frozen lake. Farmer Jan Klumaski discovered the piglet was missing from his barn and went in search of the animal - eventually finding it stuck on the lake in Ryk, Poland. Unable to reach the piglet, the farmer called emergency services who sent several firefighters to the scene. Skating on thin ice: Firefighters use a sledge to rescue a piglet from a frozen lake in Ryk, Poland . Firefighters had to use a sledge to slowly inch out on to the ice which was beginning to crack under the weight. A fire brigade spokesman said: 'The piglet was shivering and was clearly scared so the officers went into action on a sledge. 'It was touch and go.  If the piglet fell through the ice he would have been a goner. 'It was touching to see the faith in his little eyes as we moved closer to him.' The firefighters eventually managed to grab the piglet and put him a cage. Delicate operation: Firefighters had to be incredible careful crossing the ice to make sure it didn't crack, plunging the piglet into the icy waters . Dramatic rescue: The shivering and terrified piglet was eventually pulled from the ice . The spokesman added: 'Getting him into the cage was a bit . hairy as he started to kick and squirm. Luckily, the ice held and we . managed to get back to dry land safely.' Despite the dangers, the spokesman admitted the firefighters did enjoy the icey mission. He said: 'If truth be told, I think they enjoyed the ride. But of course the safety of the pig took precedence over any fun.' The piglet was reunited with its owner Mr Klumaski, who said: 'He somehow managed to escape from his pen, but I think he'll be happy to be back.  I don't like to see animals suffer.  The firemen are the real heroes in this story.'

"One of the country’s most unpopular rail companies has received another unwelcome accolade – more crimes take place on its trains than on any other line. First Great Western (FGW) – dubbed ‘Worst Late Western’ by  passengers for its frequent delays – saw an average of three offences on its trains every day last year, according to new figures. Hundreds more crimes, ranging from theft of luggage to violence, took place at London’s Paddington Station from where many of the rail operator’s trains depart. One of the country's most unpopular rail companies, First Great Western, has received another unwelcome accolade - more crimes take place on its trains than on any other line . First Great Western has been dubbed 'Worst Late Western' by  passengers for its frequent delays . Overall some 11,000 crimes were recorded in 2013 on UK trains. The figures come as commuters brace themselves to pay hundreds of pounds more for season tickets as fare rises kick in this week. In total British Transport Police recorded 53,885 offences in England, Scotland and Wales in 2012-13. This figure includes crimes at stations,  in station car parks, on tracks and on trains. A third of all crimes on the railways involved theft of passengers’ property. Violence accounted for 15 per cent, theft and vandalism of cars and bikes for 14 per cent and theft of railway property nine per cent. First Great Western's fares will rise by 3.1 per cent in the New Year . Hundreds of crimes, ranging from theft of luggage to violence, took place at London¿s Paddington Station from where many of First Great Western's trains depart . Figures obtained under the Freedom of Information ACT show that 1,179 offences were reported on FGW trains in 2013 . New figures obtained by this newspaper . under the Freedom of Information Act reveal for the first time which . rail lines suffer the highest crime rates. They show that 1,179 offences . were reported on FGW trains in 2013. The news will be greeted with . dismay by the operator’s passengers, whose fares rise by 3.1 per cent in . the New Year. The company, which serves the South West, Greater London, the South East, West Midlands and South Wales, is owned by FirstGroup PLC, whose chief executive Tim O’Toole  is paid a basic salary of £846,000. Proportionally, the route with the most crimes reported is the  state-run East Coast line, operating the main route from London King¿s Cross to Newcastle and Edinburgh . About one in ten of its trains arrives late, according to latest figures, and over the summer 500 passengers had to endure a 12-hour journey in ‘cattle truck’ conditions after a brake problem on a service from Penzance to Paddington. But FGW said its crime figures were not the worst, given the size of its network. Its trains call at 270 stations along 1,241 miles of track and carried 97 million passengers in 2012-13. The statistics mean there was a crime for every 82,527 passenger journeys on FGW trains last year. A spokesman for the firm said: ‘These figures compare well to those of East Coast, Virgin and others when passenger numbers, and the size of network, are taken into account.

"Tony Stewart has broken his silence after causing the death of a fellow race car driver at a night race on Saturday. Witnesses have reported that veteran driver Stewart hit young racer Kevin Ward Jr who was walking on the track after they collided on a prior lap at the Empire Super Sprints in Canandaigua, New York. On Sunday,  the three-time NASCAR champ issued a statement expressing his condolences to Ward Jr's family. 'There aren't words to describe the sadness I feel about the accident that took the life of Kevin Ward Jr. It's a very emotional time for all involved, and it is the reason I've decided not to participate in today's race at Watkins Glen. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and everyone affected by this tragedy,' Stewart said in a statement released by spokesman Mike Arning. The competition director of Stewart's racing team said earlier in the day that he planned to continue Sunday's race, but he was later replaced by fellow driver Regan Smith. WARNING GRAPHIC VIDEO .

The . track canceled the remainder of the Empire Super Sprints slate within . five minutes while the Ontario County Sheriff's Department says its . officers are at the track investigating but do not see it as a criminal . matter. Ontario County Sheriff Philip Povero said Stewart was 'visibly shaken' and had been cooperative in the investigation. Authorities were asking spectators and others to turn over any video they recorded of the crash. 'This is right now being investigated as an on-track crash and I don't want to infer that there are criminal charges pending,' Povero said. 'When the investigation is completed, we will sit down with the district attorney and review it. But I want to make it very clear: there are no criminal charges pending at this time.'

Witnesses at the track also described the collision. According to onlookers Ward was spun out of the race by Stewart and was hit by the three-time Nascar champion as he passed the spot on his next lap. 'It happened in Turn 2,' Adam Dulski told USA Today. 'The prior lap, Tony had gotten into him – just spun him, nothing big, just spun him around. The caution came out. He hopped out of the car – the driver of the 13 [Kevin Ward] ... he hopped out to go and yell and point a finger at Tony, typical thing.' 'Tony came around ... the back end slid out, and he definitely caught him – I couldn't tell if it was with the front or the back of the car. ... The body made contact with the car and went sliding across the track a long distance, at least 50 feet. It was the worst thing I've ever seen.' Ward Jr pictured with a woman who appears to be his girlfriend in a photo posted to his Facebook . Too late: Paramedics tend to a gravely injured Ward Jr on the track Saturday nigh . Aftermath: A video of the incident showed Ward Jr flung 50ft down the track after the collision . Tributes: Flowers are placed at the entrance of the Canandaigua Motorsports Park . Help: An ambulance is pictured parked on the infield of Canandaigua Motorsports Park on Sunday . A spokesman for Stewart's racing team called Ward's death a 'tragic accident.' 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends,' the spokesman said in a statement. 'We're still attempting to sort through all the details.' According to his website Kevin Ward Jr has been racing since age four when he first started go-karting. He started Sprint Car racing in 2011. The 20-year-old from Port Leyden, New York, was Empire Super Sprint rookie of the year in 2012 and this year was his fifth season racing the Empire Super Sprints. The competition director of Stewart's racing team says he will not race in another competition scheduled for Sunday. Pictured above in April 2014 . Stewart often competes in extracurricular events. The multimillionaire is known to participate in races with purses worth less than $3,000 and drive alongside drivers of varying ages and talent levels. The accident Saturday came almost exactly a year after Stewart suffered a compound fracture to his right leg in a sprint car race in Iowa. The injury cost him the second half of the NASCAR season. Stewart only returned to sprint track racing last month, and won in his return, at Tri-City Motor Speedway in Michigan. But the broken leg cost him the entire second-half of last season and sidelined him during NASCAR's important Chase for the Sprint Cup championship. Stewart wasn't cleared to get back in a race car until February, the day the track opened for preparations for NASCAR's season-opening Daytona 500 began. 'Everybody has hobbies. Everybody has stuff they like to do when they have downtime, and that's just what it is for me,' he said last month following his return to sprint car racing. 'That's what I like to do when I have extra time. I don't think there is anything wrong with doing it. I feel like there are a lot of other things I could be doing that are a lot more dangerous and a lot bigger waste of time with my time off do than doing that.'

"Parents take note: Spain is cracking down on its sulky teenagers. And not before time, some argue. Under a draft bill  approved in the Spanish Parliament, under 18s will be legally obliged to do chores and be 'respectful'. Teenagers in Spain could be forced to help out with the chores under a draft bill in Spain. Pictured here is a 16-year-old boy being made to do housework . If it is passed, children in the country will have to help out with the housework 'in accordance with their age and . regardless of their gender'. They will also have to 'participate in family life' and respect 'their parents and siblings', Spain's ABC newspaper reported. The Child Protection Bill children would also have to 'respect school rules' and 'study as required'. More generally these children 'will have to maintain a positive attitude about learning'. At the same time, will also have to 'respect their teachers and other staff at education teachers', as well as their fellow students. The draft law doesn't set out penalties for children who fail to fulfill these requirements, but marks a new shift in the legislation with its focus on the responsibilities of children. Sulky teenagers will also have to be more 'respectful' to their teachers at school (file picture) Other key elements of the proposed bill include the establishment of a list of known paedophiles who could be banned from working with children. Schools and companies hiring staff to work with children will have to ask applicants to provide a copy of their criminal record. The legislation would also require people working with children to report possible crimes against children and failure to do so will be considered a crime of omission.","The bill has been approved in the Spanish Parliament .

"The mother condemned to death in Sudan for marrying a Christian is being prevented from fleeing the country by her callous brother - and could face an entirely new trial. Meriam Ibrahim has been hit with a new petition by Al Samani Al Hadi who has publicly vowed to execute her if he gets the chance. But lawyers for Meriam, a 27-year-old doctor, say that he is just acting out of spite and that he does not have any authority over her. MailOnline can also reveal that Meriam could face an entirely new hearing that could delay her departure by weeks or months. Scroll down for video . Free: Meriam poses hours after her release on Monday with her husband, Daniel (left) and her children, Martin (on Daniel's knee) and baby Maya. She is now facing a possible new hurdle to her freedom . She faces forgery charges that relate to the documents she used to try and flee Sudan  - and could be hauled before a judge again. The twist represents the latest setback for Meriam in her attempt to leave Sudan and fly to the US. She was freed on June 30 after spending eight months behind bars in a horrific women's prison in the Sudanese capital Khartoum. During her time in the facility she gave birth to daughter Maya, one month, in shackles whilst her son Martin, 21 months, was by her side during the entire ordeal. The day after the sentence was overturned Meriam and her family tried to fly to South Sudan en route to the US but she was detained and accused of using false papers in a naked attempt to thrawt her by the Sudanese government. Now adding to her woes is her half brother Al Hadi, a strict Muslim who was supposedly furious when he learned she had been let out of jail and vowed vengeance to restore Muslim honour. Meriam's lawyer Shareif Ali Shareif told MailOnline: ‘Her brother [Al Samani Al Hadi] has launched a new petition to the family court to prove that Meriam is his sister. ‘He does not want Meriam to travel to Sudan. 'Barbaric': As well as the death sentence for apostasy (the crime of abandoning your religion) Ibrahim was also sentenced to 100 lashes for what the court deemed her adultery for marrying a Christian . ‘He asked the court to rule that Meriam is his sister. This would give him a legal right over her. ‘But he does not have the authority to demand this right – it is only a father or a mother that can demand this legal status. 'He is doing this to prevent Meriam from travelling outside of Sudan. ‘Meriam has not been officially informed of this latest move. She has not been interviewed and has not appeared in court. ‘We [Meriam’s legal team] are aware of the new legal process but we have not received any documents as yet.' Meriam is married to Daniel Wani, a naturalized US citizen, and was sentenced to death and 100 lashes for apostasy and adultery when she married him because the court did not recognize the wedding. A judge ruled that because she was born a Muslim - her father left home when she was six - it did not matter that she was raised a Christian and said that she had the renounce her faith or die. Fight for life: Mr Wani, an American citizen, has been fighting for his wife and children's release but his lawyers believe the help he has received from the US embassy has been 'shameful' Meriam's family history is complicated and it appears Al Hadi was part of the second family that her father started after he left her mother. She claims never to have met him in her life and his motives for interfering in her life seem somewhat murky. Shareif told MailOnline that Meriam still has to deal with the forgery allegations before she is free to leave Sudan and move in with Daniel, a biochemist who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire. A hearing is set for Thursdsay but what happens after that is unclear. He said: ‘Meriam wants to leave Sudan as soon as possible. ‘But she is still being investigated by the National Intelligence and Security Service with relation to the allegation that she had obtained a false travel document. This is still on-going. ‘Meriam has not been given an American passport.' Tina Ramirez, of religious campaign group Hardwired, said that she did not know what the court would do about the forgery allegations. Road to freedom: Meriam Ibrahim holds her baby girl close as she is driven away from the police station in Khartoum on Thursday night . She said that it was possible Meriam could have to go through a new trial, but negotiations are said to be ongoing between the Sudanese government and the US embassy in Khartoum over her release. Meriam's case attracted international attention and the governments of the UK, the US and the United Nations all called for her to be freed. Bill and Hillary Clinton were also among those demanding she be released, as was human rights campaigner Mia Farrow. MailOnline has repeatedly highlighted Meriam's case and has spoken to numerous Senators who are behind attempts to get her to America. Shareif told MailOnline that despite all the strain Meriam and her family are under they are 'all fine'. He said: 'Meriam, Daniel and the children are in good health.’","Meriam Ibrahim, 27, could now face a new trial despite her death sentence being overturned .

"A couple got a shock when they noticed their unborn baby’s ultrasound scan looked like the evil galactic overlord from the Star Wars movies, Emperor Palpatine. Heather Large, 39, was having her 20-week scan with husband Toby, 33, in Pingree Grove, Illinois, when they caught sight of the shadowy Dark Lord apparently lurking inside her womb. They immediately recognised the image as that of Luke Skywalker's power-hungry nemesis, Dark Side devotee and mentor to Darth Vader, known in later episodes as Darth Sidious. But fortunately, four months later when the baby, real name Bowie, emerged from the shadows of Heather's uterus, the couple were relieved to find he looked nothing like the malevolent tyrant, played in the films by English actor Ian McDiarmid. Evil surprise: Mother Heather Large, 39, immediately spotted the seemingly cloaked figure during the ultrasound during the 20th week of her pregnancy and pointed out it looked just like Emperor Palpatine, right. Toby said: 'During the ultrasound, . Heather noticed that one of the images appeared to look like Emperor . Palpatine from Star Wars. 'At this point, everyone in the room had a laugh, including our eight-year-old daughter Hannah and the ultrasound technician. 'At the end of the ultrasound, the tech asked us if we would like to include that image on our take-home CD, since we were so amused.' Evil baby: Toby only realised the scan of his son Bowie, who is now eight months old, would cause a fuss among Star Wars fans when he uploaded it to his webpage last week .

"Laylah Petersen: Laylah Petersen, 5, was shot and killed Thursday when two shooters opened fire on her home shooting her in the head . A five-year-old girl was fatally shot while sitting on her grandfather's lap when two people approached her Milwaukee home and opened fire, according to police, who sought help Friday in finding the shooters. Laylah Petersen was shot in the head when one of a dozen bullets that hit the home came through a wall about 6 p.m. Thursday. Laylah, who was sitting on a couch with her grandfather, died at a hospital. Investigators said there was no clear motive for the shooting and they needed the public's help to find those responsible for the shooting on the city's northwest side. Police said officers had no previous calls to the home, and they don't believe anyone living at the home was specifically targeted. 'We believe that this bullet read, 'To whom it may concern.' And that concerns all of us, and that should concern everybody in our community,' Capt. Aaron Raap said during a news conference Friday. 'If you saw something, say something. If you hear something, say something.' Raap said initial descriptions of the shootings as being 'targeted' referred to the fact that all 12 bullets fired hit the house. Officers found a dozen casings at the scene, and were looking into whether more than one handgun was used. They also were interviewing witnesses and seeking any possible surveillance video. Father: Laylah's father, Robert Petersen, said he was trying to better himself so he could give his children, who were being raised by their grandparents at the time, the life they deserved . Aunt: Amanda Legler, Laylah's aunt, spoke through tears in front of the Milwaukee home and demanded justice for her slain niece . Rapp said in a conference on Friday that investigators are 'vigorously following up on leads' but officials are 'befuddled' as to the motive behind the crime, according to Fox6Now. Police Chief Edward Flynn said two young children were being raised by their grandparents in the house, where people left flowers, toys and other items in a makeshift memorial for the little girl Friday. 'This is a stable, loving, working family in a stable working-class neighborhood where everybody is trying to do the right thing,' Flynn said. Wild Child: Legler said that Laylah was a 'wild child,' 'full of life, and the 'happiest child you'll ever meet' Vigil: A Facebook page indicates that a candlelight vigil will be held for the child Sunday . In an interview with Fox, Laylah's father, Robert Petersen, said his daughter was his 'whole life' and described her as 'the sweetest little girl, so smart and so beautiful.' 'I've never felt this pain in my life,' Petersen said. 'All I've been trying to do is better myself so one day I can take [my children] and give them the life that they deserve.' The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has offered a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case. 'There is no reason conceivable that I can think of that would explain this wanton, violent act,' Flynn told reporters Thursday night. 'We are going to find (the shooters). We are going to arrest them. And they are going to jail.' Shots: Twelve shots burst through the home Thursday at 6pm and one of the bullets pierced a wall then struck the five-year-old in the head . Reward: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has offered a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case of the shooting that took place in the child's Milwaukee home (above) Laylah's aunt Amanda Legler, spoke in front of the home saying that Laylah was a 'wild child' and 'full of life.' 'Just last week we went trick-or-treating and she told me Ti-Ti Manna, I love you more than science,' Lelger told the Journal Sentinel. 'That was just Laylah, she was so bizarre and so cute. She was just the happiest child you'll ever meet.' A Facebook page indicates that a candlelight vigil will be held for the girl on Sunday. Laylah is the third child under age 13 whose death was considered a homicide this year in Milwaukee, Lt. Mark Stanmeyer said. But the city has seen fewer homicides this year than last, 76 compared to 93 at the same time in 2013. At this point last year, four children under 13 had been killed.

"SeaWorld is facing more scrutiny after a dolphin at one of its parks bit a nine-year-old girl earlier this month. The beleaguered park’s San Antonio Dolphin Cove has come under fire from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals after a dolphin bit the young girl during a February 22nd visit with her family. PETA has asked Texas authorities to investigate the park because it allows visitors to touch the sea mammals, which it calls an ‘animal welfare violation,’ according to a complaint obtained by ABC News. CHomp: THe dolphin latched on to the nine-year-old girl's hand strongly enough to require park staff to force it to release her . A picture released by the animal rights group shows the dolphin chomping down on the girl’s hand as she reaches out to pet it. A PETA spokesperson claimed to ABC that the dolphin bit the hand so tightly that park staff had to force it to let go. ‘This incident and exhibit clearly endangered both the dolphin and the public,’ a PETA lawyer claims before citing Texas laws that require ‘sufficient distance and/or barriers between animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.’ Another PETA lawyer argued in the complaint that the park’s entire concept is flawed. ‘It’s stressful enough for far-ranging dolphins to be locked up in SeaWorld’s tiny tanks, but forcing them to interact with visitors is downright dangerous. ‘SeaWorld’s ‘Dolphin Cove’ is another example of how the park’s main priority is profit, not the welfare of the animals or the safety of its guests,’ he continued. Flawed: PETA says allowing humans to go so closely to humans, and even be touched by them, is in violation of the animal welfare act . SeaWorld has more than 100 incidents of animal aggression at is multiple parks on record, the PETA spokesperson claimed to ABC. The unidentified girl sustained bite marks and swelling to her hand, PETA told ABC. SeaWorld claims it is looking into the incident and cooperating with USDA investigators. MailOnline was not immediately able to reach the USDA for comment. This is just the latest bad PR for SeaWorld since the Blackfish documentary came out and a trainer was killed in 2010 by Tilikum, a 1,300-pound killer whale at the Orlando park. The trainer was the third person to die as a result of aggression by the animal, according to reports.","The nine-year-old girl was bitten during a February 22 visit .

"A video surfaced this week showing Donald Sterling's notorious former girlfriend, V. Stiviano, making racially charged remarks about people of color.

Ironic: Stiviano gained notoriety last month after she secretly recorded LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling (right) lambasting her for posing for pictures with black people . Sterling's former mistress has both African-American and Mexican roots. The 31-year-old model sparked a firestorm last month when she secretly recorded Los Angeles Clippers owner Sterling chastising her for posing for pictures with NBA legend Magic Johnson, who is black. In the newly released video of Stiviano, the model mocks African-Americans for their supposed tendency to waste their money on trivial things. 'They're like, “Yo, I wanna put extra rims on top of my rims. And my rims are gonna turn around. I'm gonna call them spinners,""' she says. She continues her rant, adding: 'They do stupid s*** like that, when there's people starving around the world.

"Tireless philanthropist and Manhattan socialite, Brooke Astor, shared her wealth from beyond the grave yesterday as hundreds of personal possessions from her estate were auctioned at Sotheby's, selling for a total of $8.7million. Among the bargain hunters of the two-day auction was her own grandson, Phillip Marshall, who set out to buy a 9-inch, 14th-century bronze Tibetan . statue with an estimated sale price of $3,500. However the 59-year-old Buddhist, prepared to match the estimate, was far outbid when the saute went for $134,500, nearly 40 times the estimated price. Family heirlooms at auction: Among the bargain hunters of the late Brooke Astor's two-day auction was her own grandson, Phillip Marshall, who set out to buy a 9-inch, 14th-century bronze Tibetan statue . Despite losing the bid on his own . family's treasure, Mr Marshall said he was thrilled with the amount of . money being raised for some of the late Astor’s favorite charities. 'This is so wonderful,' he told the New York Post. 'I have enough possessions. At this point it’s a spectator sport. The charities are winning.' According to Women's Wear Daily, a pair of Japanese jars, estimated at $15,000, sold for  $170,500. A telephone bidder . at the auction escalated the price so much that Maarten ten Holder, who led the auction, felt compelled to say, 'Do . put your glasses on. Just to make sure,' when a man on the . floor bid $140,000. Soaring prices: This 9-inch, 14th-century bronze Tibetan statue had an estimated sale price of $3,500, but sold for $134,500, nearly 40 times the estimated price . Astor, a charitable millionaire who died in 2007 at age 105, was a fixture in New York's high society, and some of her possessions became as well known as the socialite herself. Her . favourite emerald and diamond Bulgari necklace, estimated at . $350,000, is also up for grabs today, the final day of the auction, along with dozens of dog paintings and porcelain tea sets. From a small leather jewellery case starting at just $80, to a Tiepolo drawing for $400,000, a vast array of personal items from Astor's Park Avenue apartment, and her Westchester mansion, Holly Hill, both currently under administration of New York State, are going up for auction. The 900 lots at the two-day auction . were expected to fetch a total of $6million to $10million.But after just . several hours, the Astor collection had already brought in $3million. Old favourites: Brooke Astor's most precious . personal items will go up for sale, including her favourite dazzling . diamond and emerald necklace from Bulgari, which is estimated at . $350,000 . Barking mad: The staircase at Brooke Astor's Westchester estate, Holly Hill, is lined with the paintings of the late socialite's favourite animal that will go up for auction in September . Priceless: William Nedham's A Toy Spaniel and a Springer Spaniel in a Landscape is just one of the many paintings of dogs owned by the late Mrs Astor . Animal auction: Among the highlights are Mrs Astor's dog paintings, many of which hung salon-style along the spiral stairwell in Holly Hill . Mr Marshall told Bloomberg Business Week prior to the auction: 'There are so many small objects that . are hopefully affordable for people. They were just as important to her . as her expensive paintings.' And . as Mrs Astor wished, the proceeds are going to her favorite charities, . like the New York Public Library, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the . Animal Medical Center. Although the state, as . administrator, has the authority to sell assets of the estate, some have . said that donating proceeds to Astor's preferred beneficiaries is . not quite as simple as they would hope. Mr Marshall told the Wall Street Journal in December: . 'This complex estate remains in surrogate's court in Westchester. And it . is much more complicated than initially presumed... that . monies realized from the sale would go to charity.' Ladylike touches: In 1953, Mrs Astor (pictured in 1991 going to a construction site for housing and homeless) married her third husband, Vincent Astor, the oldest son of millionaire John Jacob Astor IV . High society jewels: A fixture in New York's society, Ms Astor's jewels became as well known as the socialite herself, many of which will be auctioned off at Sotheby's . Precious gems: Admiring collectors have an eye on her beloved animal figurines and numerous teapots . Antique chic: Mrs Astor's ornaments and decorative accents like these Chinese lamps and George III mirror date back hundreds of years and were purchased in different parts of the world . High tea: Astor's teapots and romantic furniture pieces will also go up for auction on September 24 . One person who won't be seeing any of auction's money will be his father, Anthony Marshall, who was found guilty . in 2009 of fraud and grand larceny, taking advantage of his mother's dementia in order to steal . millions of dollars from her. While . all of Astor's furniture had originally been left to Anthony, after . his conviction he reached a settlement with the state attorney general . stipulating that all furniture be returned to her estate, leaving him . with just $14million. Charlene, . his wife, whom Astor had a particular distaste for, was left one . necklace and two fur coats that were too small for her. Admiring collectors have a keen eye on her beloved paintings of dogs, many of which hung salon-style along the spiral stairwell in Holly Hill, and her antique Chinese lacquer furniture dating back to the Qing dynasty. Charity clause: As Mrs Astor wished, the proceeds from her estate will go to her favorite charities, like the New York Public Library, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Animal Medical Center .

"Hillary Clinton tried her best on Monday to walk back her controversial economic body-slam from a speech on Friday, explaining away her claim that it's not 'corporations and businesses that create jobs.' The talking point three days later: 'So-called trickle-down economics has failed. I short-handed this point the other day, so let me be absolutely clear about what I've been saying for a couple of decades.” “Our economy grows when businesses and entrepreneurs create good-paying jobs here in America and workers and families are empowered to build from the bottom up and the middle out – not when we hand out tax breaks for corporations that outsource jobs or stash their profits overseas.' But the damage has been done. Conservatives have a new rally cry – 'Don’t let anybody tell you that it’s, you know, corporations and businesses that create jobs,' she said – and campaign consultants will have a new advertisement drawn up if Clinton runs for president in 2016. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hillary Clinton at a rally for Massachusetts gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley on October 24: ''Don’t let anybody tell you that it’s corporations and businesses that create jobs' Clinton on October 27 stumping for New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney: 'So-called trickle-down economics has failed. I short-handed this point the other day' Comics and conservatives lit up Twitter after Hillary Clinton's jobs gaffe -- and didn't let up when she tried to walk it back . Bloomberg News Washington bureau chief Jonathan Allen quickly pointed out Friday, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, that Clinton-haters looking for a source to refute her claims about job creation need look ho further than her own memoir, 'Hard Choices.' In the book, she writes of American companies 'slowly gaining access to Indian markets, creating jobs and opportunities for people in both countries.' Later she recalls how a U.S. Chamber of Commerce junket was organized 'because more trade between America and South Africa promised to create jobs and opportunities in both countries.' But there she was in Boston, appearing alongside stalwart liberal women – gubernatorial hopeful Martha Coakley and Senator Elizabeth Warren – and seemingly trying to maneuver herself into a position more populist than either one. Warren is a presidential hopeful long pined-for by progressive hardliners who think Clinton is too close to the Democratic establishment to be much of a change-maker. Another possible explanation for Clinton's Friday gaffe is that she may have omitted words from her prepared speech, as her aides insisted to reporters at the Massachusetts rally. An indictment of 'tax breaks for' corporations and businesses, and a claim that they don't aid job creation, would hardly have registered a blip on anyone's campaign radar. But delivered as it was, 'Don’t let anybody tell you that it’s corporations and businesses that create jobs' brought critics out of the woodwork on Twitter. 'Huh?' comedian John Lovitz tweeted. 'That's not trickle down, that's who hires people.' 'Every job I've gotten is from a business & corporation,' he added. 'And when the corporation goes out of business, people lose their jobs! Common cents!' And Monday's walk-back notwithstanding, Republicans immediately pointed to Clinton's seeming dismissal of job-creators as a retread of one of President Barack Obama's most loathed talking points. During a July 13, 2012 speech in Roanoke, Virginia, Obama offended free-marketeers and small businessmen and women by suggesting that the government had more to do with their successes than they did themselves. Welcome to Campaign 2016: Clinton's explanation for her ill-timed line on job creation didn't sit well with many -- especially partisans who weren't in her corner to begin with . Everybody's a comedian: Clinton will earn no end of scorn from what the GOP will regard as her 'You Didn't Build That' moment . 'If you were successful ... somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive,' he said. 'Somebody invested in roads and bridges.' 'If you've got a business – you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.' He said later in the speech that successful entrepreneurs 'didn't get there on your own. I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart.' The so-called 'trickle-down' economic theory, itself a shorthand for a broader set of ideas, is generally understood to refer to policies that put capital in the hands of business instead of government, with the expectation that the money will create jobs and other economic activity. Conservative politicians generally express their approval of the idea by green-lighting tax breaks and other benefits to corporations and high-income earners. Liberal pols typically criticize the theory by insisting that tax breaks and other government benefits go directly to lower-income Americans, including many who don't pay taxes.","Clinton sent pundits into a tizzy on Friday in Massachusetts with a ham-fisted attack on 'trickle down economics'

"Controversial: Josie Cunningham had her breasts enlarged to 36DD on the NHS - and now wants them reduced, as well as compensation . An aspiring glamour model who had a £4,800 taxpayer-funded breast enlargement is to sue the NHS because her new assets are too big. Josie Cunningham, of Leeds, said her 36DD breasts have ruined her life by making her the target of online abuse. It is the third time the unmarried mother-of-two has demanded money from the taxpayer. Not only did they foot the cost of her breast enlargement, but Miss Cunningham is now insisting on a reduction and compensation. She claims she was not properly consulted before her operation and wants compensation for clinical negligence and emotional distress. Miss Cunningham, who works in telesales, has consulted no-win, no-fee lawyers so she can ‘take [the NHS] for every penny’. She said: ‘I want in excess of £10,000. Anything I can get over that is a bonus.’ The 23-year-old came under fire after revealing the details of her taxpayer-funded operation, which came while far more deserving cases failed to receive NHS funds. Miss Cunningham, who was told she had no breast tissue due to a congenital condition, was allowed the treatment in January after complaining about being bullied since the age of 14 over her flat chest. Funding was recommended by her GP and she underwent surgery in January at St James’s Hospital in Leeds, boosting her bust from a 32A to a 36DD. Two months later she showed off her new figure to tabloid newspapers in the hope of launching a lucrative career as a topless model. At the time she said her new breasts gave her the ‘confidence’ to pursue her dream and that she hoped to emulate former Page 3 girl Katie Price, also known as Jordan. But she claims her assets have not helped her career and she now wants them reduced - also on the NHS. Miss Cunningham told The Sun: ‘I was rushed through the process. I didn’t actually ask for 36DD — I would have been happier with a B cup. ‘But they told me that because I didn’t have any breast tissue I’d have to go for bigger breasts. They haven’t helped me one bit. In fact, my life is ruined.’ Within hours of her revealing her . intention to sue, internet users posted angry comments on Twitter . expressing their disbelief at her shamelessness. Before and after: Josie was a 32A (left) before the NHS surgery to boost her bust to a 36DD (right) Nicola Allen posted: ‘Is Josie Cunningham for real? NHS do your boobs for free when women that really need it have to pay, & now you sue?’ Twitter user @ellchaplin9311m added: ‘That Josie Cunningham is a disgrace. Attempting to sue the NHS because her boobs are too big! It isn’t your boobs ruining your “career”.’ Another user, @SDFFPodcast10m, posted: ‘Josie Cunningham who got a free boob job will sue the nhs for ruining her life, I think I’ll sue her for ruining my view of humanity.’ But others were more scathing branding her a ‘waste of space’, ‘dirty piece of scum’ and ‘worthless human’.

"The husband of the pregnant woman who was beaten to death in broad daylight has admitted he murdered his first wife to be with her. Farzana Parveen, 25, was attacked with bricks by 20 family members because she 'illegally' married the man she loved. The honour killing, on the steps of Lahore court, sparked global outrage as police reportedly looked on doing nothing. Today, the victim's husband confessed he killed his first wife so they could marry - and revealed that Farzana's older sister was also murdered by her family in an honour killing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Revealed: Mohammed Iqbal, 45 (left), confessed in a phone interview that he killed his first wife to marry Farzana Parveen, 25 (right), the pregnant woman stoned to death by her family for marrying the man she loved . 'I was in love with Farzana and killed my first wife because of this love,' Mohammed Iqbal, 45, told AFP. Mr Iqbal said he was spared prison because his son, who reported the murder, later dropped the charges. He then hung up his phone and has not responded to further calls. Earlier in the conversation, he said that Farzana's older sister, Rehana, was poisoned by her family after her father had an argument with her parents-in-law. Farzana's stepson, Muhammad Aurangzeb, supported the claim. Their father ordered Rehana to leave her husband, The Times reports, but she refused. Women's rights groups insist the murder was not reported to the police. The shocking revelations come after Mr Iqbal berated the police for refusing to save his late wife. He said that police did nothing during the 15 minutes the violence lasted outside Lahore High Court. 'I . begged them to help us but they said, this is not our duty,' he said. 'I took off my shirt (to be humble) and begged them . to save her.' Farzana Parveen, 25, who was three months pregnant, was killed by nearly 20 members of the woman's family, including her father and brothers in Lahore on Tuesday . Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has demanded to know why police apparently stood by, his spokesman said today. In . parts of Pakistan, a largely Muslim nation of 180 million people, women . are expected to agree to arranged marriages and refusal can mean an . 'honour killing'. Many Pakistani families think it dishonourable for a woman to fall in love and choose her own husband. Sharif . had taken notice of the 'brutal killing' in the presence of police, his . press office said in a statement, adding that a 'totally unacceptable' crime had to be dealt with promptly by law. 'I am . directing the chief minister to take immediate action and a report must . be submitted by this evening to my office,' it said, quoting Sharif. Last . night her body was buried in the presence of some 100 mourners from her . husband's family at around 2 a.m. in a village graveyard in Pakistan's . eastern Punjab province. He said his family had chosen to bury her at night because of the gruesome state of her remains. Police initially said Farzana had been stoned, but said today that relatives had swung bricks, not thrown them. All the suspects, except the father, who has been detained, have disappeared.

The 25-year-old had offended her family by marrying Iqbal instead of a cousin selected for her . A police officer on Tuesday quoted the father as saying it had been an honour killing. The 25-year-old had offended her family by marrying Iqbal instead of a cousin selected for her. Honour killings are common in Pakistan, but the brutality of this case caused outrage around the world. Police said her father, two brothers and a former fiance were among the attackers. Muhammad . Aurangzeb, Farzana's 20-year-old stepson, described how one relative . had tried to shoot her, then grabbed her head scarf, causing her to fall . over. While a member of Iqbal's party wrestled the gun away, a female cousin grabbed a brick and hit Farzana with it, he said. 'She . was screaming and crying 'don't kill me, we will give you money',' said . Iqbal. He said he tried to save her but the mob of more than 20 beat . him back. At one point, six people were beating her with bricks as she screamed, he said, and he and his stepson begged police to help. Finally she stopped screaming. The attack happened near the gate of the heavily guarded court, the two men said, on one of the busiest roads in Lahore. The . couple had been due to testify there that morning that their marriage . was genuine in response to a false charge of kidnapping brought by . Farzana's family. It was not the first time her family had tried to kill the woman, said her lawyer, Rai Ghulan Mustafa. On May 12, seven of her relatives had tried to force their way into his office, where she was sitting, . he said, but his colleagues had fought them off. Later . they attacked her near a police station. Officers intervened and held . the attackers for an hour before releasing them without charge, he said. 'She was afraid of being killed,' Mustafa said. The case is the latest honour killing in Pakistan to outrage the world. 'I . do not even wish to use the phrase honour killing,' said U.N. High . Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay in a statement in Geneva. Pakistani human rights activists chant slogans during a protest in Islamabad today . A Pakistani human rights activists hold placards during a protest in Islamabad today . Pakistan's Prime Minister demanded 'immediate action' over the brutal murder . 'There is not the faintest vestige of honour in killing a woman in this way.' But for two days, the attack met with silence from Pakistani officials. Most . national media outlets gave little attention to the story. Honour . killings are so common they usually only rate a paragraph or two. Women have been mutilated and killed for wearing jeans, looking out of windows, singing or giving birth to girls. The . Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said there were 869 such attacks . reported in the media last year - several a day. But the true figure is . probably much higher since many cases are never reported. A . small editorial in the national daily the Express Tribune denounced the . killing and noted a case in New York where a 75-year-old Pakistani . immigrant beat his wife to death this month for serving him a vegetarian . meal. 'The . great tragedy for the nation, alongside the murder of yet another . Pakistani woman, is that the man's lawyer claimed the man acted on his . cultural upbringing where beating women is customary,' the writer said. Baroness . Sayeeda Warsi, a senior minister of state in the British government and . of Pakistani origin, said she was appalled by the killing.

"Catholic priests say they are living in fear after a clergyman was murdered on the final day of a music festival promoting religious tolerance. Father Evaristus Mushi was shot dead by two men on motorcycles on the last day of the Sounds of Wisdom festival in Zanzibar and his death has prompted concern that religious tensions on the holiday island are increasing. The Bishop of Zanzibar said members of the clergy are terrified of further attacks. Children dance at the Sounds of Wisdom festival days before a Catholic priest was shot dead on Zanzibar . The popular music festival promotes religious tolerance between Muslims and Christians on the island . Since the murder on February 17 a church has also been set on fire. Five churches were torched on the island in 2012. Bishop Augustine Shao was quoted as saying in Catholic News: 'We are very afraid'. It is the fourth attack on Christian or Islamic clergy in the past four months. Protestant pastor Mathew Kachira was killed on February 10, Catholic News reported, and Father Ambrose Mkenda was shot and wounded on Christmas Day. In November a Muslim cleric was injured in an acid attack. Bishop Shao said clergy have been sent threatening texts following Father Mushi's murder. He told Catholic News that the type of attack 'is new to the country and we are looking for reasons', adding that the perpetrators could be using religion as a cover. The island is classed as a semi-autonomous region of Tanzania and some believes that terrorists demanding independence from Tanzania are behind the murder. It has been reported that priests and bishops in Tanzania received texts praising the Somalia-trained men who murdered the priest and warned of further attacks at Easter. There are fears religious tensions on the popular tourist island are increasing after Father Mushi was shot . The bishop said warnings had also been . received that the killings would continue until Muslim leaders jailed . after disturbances on the island last year were freed. The murder happened on the final day of the tenth Sounds of Wisdom festival or Sauti za Busara. Yusuf Mahmoud, the festival director, told the crowd that a major purpose of the event was 'breaking down barriers between Muslims and Christians, black and white', according to The Guardian. Three days later the Pool of Siloam Church was set on fire. Police said three men stoned a security guard before setting the church alight. It is the second attack on the church in two years. In 2011, 80 people pulled down the building. The majority of islanders are Muslim, with Christians making up as little as five per cent of the population. Retired Anglican bishop John Ramadhani told The Guardian that religion was being used for political goals. He said: 'There has been harmony and toleration in the past but I think there is perhaps a belief that Christians should not be here.' Father Mushi's murder has been condemned by the president of Tanzania Jakaya Kikwete, who has sent detectives from the mainland to assist in the inquiries.","Father Evaristus Mushi was shot dead by two men on motorcycles .

"Toronto Mayor Rob Ford is battling a rare form of cancer, his doctor announced Wednesday. The 45-year-old mayor, who gained notoriety last year when a video was released showing him smoking crack-cocaine, was hospitalized last week after complaining about a 'unbearable' pain in his abdomen. Doctors at Mt Sinai discovered that the root of the pain was a 'fair sized' tumor. Today, Ford's physician Dr Zane Cohen said the mayor would be undergoing chemotherapy to treat the  tumor. 'It is a difficult and very rare type of tumor,' Dr Cohen said. 'It’s a fairly aggressive tumor.' Scroll down for video . Malignant: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, and will now undergo treatment with chemotherapy. The mayor pictured above at city hall last July 9 . My brother has been diagnosed with cancer and I can't begin to share how devastating this has been for Rob and our family. He is an incredible person, husband, father, brother and son and he remains upbeat and determined to fight this. Rob has always been so strong for all of us and now I ask us all to be strong for him. Your kind words and well wishes mean everything to him right now. Rob will beat this. On behalf of Rob, his wife Renata, their children, and the entire Ford family, thank you all so much for your continued support and prayers. Last Friday, Ford announced that he could be facing 'the battle of my lifetime' and withdrew his name from his mayoral race. His brother Doug Ford is now running instead. After dropping out of the mayoral race, Ford signed up to run as a councillor in Etobicoke. It's uncertain if he will continue in that race considering the latest diagnosis. While Ford did not speak at the press conference on Wednesday, his brother Doug issued a statement on behalf of the family saying 'Rob will beat this'. 'Rob has always been so strong for all of us and now I ask us all to be strong for him,' Doug added. Last week, Doug Ford said he wouldn't start campaigning for mayor until after today's announcement. 'I’ll be out there, I promise you,' he told the Globe and Mail last week. 'We’ve got five weeks and we’re going to be going hard. I just want to get over this little hurdle, and we’re going full steam ahead right now.' Aggressive: Ford's physician, Dr Zane Cohen announced Wednesday that the mayor is battling a 'very rare type of tumor' that is 'fairly aggressive' The other leading candidates in the race,  John Tory and Olivia Chow, were scheduled to debate this evening but that event has been cancelled '""out of respect for Mayor Ford and his family'. Both Tory and Chow called Ford last week to give him their best wishes. 'I can’t imagine how difficult this must be for the Ford family,' Chow said Wednesday. Ford took a two-month break from office this summer to undergo rehab for substance abuse issues, and returned to work in July. Last November, Ford admitted to smoking crack-cocaine, but refused to step down from office. Apparently, he had been experiencing abdominal pain for about three months prior to his hospitalization last week. Ford's family has a history of cancer, too. His father, former Ontario MPP Doug Ford, Sr died of colon cancer in 2006. And in 2009, Ford himself had another tumor removed from his appendix.

"Tragic loss: Professor Jonathon Driver died on November 28, 2011 . A world-renowned neuroscientist jumped to his death off a 60ft-high bridge after becoming unable to cope with the pain of a serious knee injury. Professor Jonathon Driver, 49, dislocated his right knee in a motorbike crash in January last year, an inquest heard this week. He felt unable to cope with his work and feared becoming a burden to his wife and two sons, aged 13 and ten, with whom he lived in Crouch End, North London. The academic was one of just six scientists worldwide with a Royal Society Anniversary Research Professorship – a coveted post held by many Nobel Prize winners. He was also a gifted bass guitarist and member of the pop group London Boys. The . Halifax-born father-of-two began struggling to cope with his . high-powered work and worried he was becoming a burden on his young . family. His wife, . Professor Nilli Lavie, told the inquest on Monday: ‘I’ve known Jon for . 20 years and I’d never, ever seen him depressed or down before the . accident. ‘He was a very energetic, positive doer of a person, there was a lot of life force in him.’ Professor . Driver’s energy declined as his injuries prevented the keen sportsman . and bass guitarist returning to work or coaching his son’s football . club, St Pancras Coroner’s Court heard. Professor . Lavie, who worked alongside her renowned husband at UCL’s Institute of . Cognitive Neuroscience, said: ‘There was a period when he couldn’t sleep . for three weeks. ‘During those sleepless nights he would go over and over the accident in his mind. ‘His . work depended on his intellectual ability. It was clear to Jon that he . wouldn’t be able to manage the expectations as a Royal Society . professor.’ She . added that her husband was a ‘very honest person’ and would withdraw . from the appointment if he could not fulfill the expectations of the . role. However he worried he would be left jobless and unable to get any . interviews because it was clear he was in so much pain. Recalling her husband’s final months, Professor Lavie said: ‘He could see the burden it placed on me. Researchers at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London found participants experienced different levels of responsibility depending on whether what they did was right of wrong . ‘I had to keep my job, play the role of two parents to the kids and look after him as well.’ Professor Driver had two operations to increase his knee mobility, but developed intense neuropathic pain in his right leg. The . top neuroscientist was diagnosed with depression, insomnia and . post-traumatic stress disorder and put on antidepressants last summer. Professor . Lavie grew increasingly alarmed at her husband’s mental state the . weekend before he died on November 28 last year after he confided to her . he had considered killing himself. Professor Lavie called his psychiatrist to discuss putting her husband on suicide watch. Deputy coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe ruled that Professor Driver took his own life on November 28. She said: ‘He was such a highly-functioning individual who clearly understood what he was doing.’ Born in Halifax and brought up in Hull, Professor Driver was a gifted bass guitarist. His band the London Boys were dubbed Hull’s ‘most talented and imaginative pop group’ by the Daily Mail in the early 1980s. On the cusp of a promising academic future at Oxford University, pop singer Sade asked him to become her full-time bass player. But Professor Driver rejected her offer and spent the next ten years at Christchurch College, completing a degree in psychology, a PhD and a junior fellowship. He took up his first lecture position in Cambridge University’s Experimental Psychology department before moving to UCL where he worked until his death. Professor Driver’s work focused on the connection between perception and selective attention, both in normal and damaged brains. The neuro expert published more than 300 papers and is one of the most cited scientists in the world. Professor Lavie told the Ham & High newspaper after her husband’s death: ‘He looked into all the options and all the forecasts were very grim. ‘It became quite clear that he would be half the man that he was, both as a professional and also as a father and husband because he was in pain all the time. ‘He thought about it for a long time and concluded that having the pain all the time meant he could never fulfill what he had been. He felt he was going to become more of a burden at time went on. ‘A very big component of it was a selfless act. He thought he would just drag us down. ‘He didn’t want the boys to remember him as he went on. Instead of being the dad he would become the patient.'","Expert in cognitive neuroscience at UCL .

"A failed asylum seeker strangled and drowned a bakery worker who refused to marry him so he could stay in the UK. Iranian-born Hossein Abdollahzadeh, 32, left Agnieszka Dziegielewska's naked body in a bath full of water at her flat in Swinton, near Rotherham, just weeks after she kicked him out. He later hanged himself in his prison cell while on remand charged with Dziegielewska's murder, the inquest in Rotherham heard. Agnieszka moved to the UK from . Bialystok, Poland, in 2004 - the year the country became a full member . of the EU - and met Abdollahzadeh four years later at his takeaway pizza . shop in Swinton. Marrying Agnieszka, an EU citizen, would have enabled . the Iranian to continue living in the UK. The inquest heard Agnieszka Dziegielewska had been throttled with a ligature before having her head pushed under bath water. A chair had also been placed over her body . It emerged at the hearing that Abdollahzadeh treated his partner of two years 'like a servant', regularly slapping and beating her which left her covered in bruises. He also refused to believe their relationship was over when she left him to escape the violence. Ms Dziegielewska's mother said Abdollahzadeh had previously tried to strangle her daughter in 2008, holding her neck with both hands and issuing the chilling warning: 'Nobody can help you now.' She added: 'He started treating her . like a servant and humiliating her in public. On one occasion he slapped . her so hard her tooth got loose. Each time he would explain he didn't . know why it had happened, and it wouldn't happen again.' The inquest was told that when he . killed her in January last year she had been throttled with a ligature before having her head . pushed under the bath water. A chair had also been placed over her . body. When she finally plucked up the . courage to ask her partner to leave he wrote 'I love you' in the snow . outside and bought her flowers and a cake with candles for her 30th . birthday . Pathologist Dr Peter Vanezis, who . examined the body, said she could have been attacked for up to 10 . minutes, and that Agnieszka had fought back by 'struggling . significantly' before her death. Detective Superintendent Colin Fisher . told the inquest: 'He had failed in his application for political . asylum having claimed he had been persecuted as a journalist. 'He could not work or claim benefits yet still set up his own business and was drawing an income. 'His appeals were coming to an end and his last chance of staying in the UK was for him to marry an EU citizen.' When asked by coroner Nicola Mundy if . anyone else was involved in Miss Dziegielewska's death, he replied: 'No . ma'am. There is no evidence of any other person being involved.' Witnesses told the inquest that . Abdollahzadeh - who ran an illegal pizza takeaway service - only went . out with Miss Dziegielewska because he wanted to marry her so he could . stay in the UK. Det Supt Fisher told the court that . her new boyfriend Daniel Sandhall, a shift manager at her bakery, had . been completely exonerated of murder and Abdollahzadeh was the only . suspect. Grisly end: The 30-year-old woman was murdered at her flat in Swinton, Rotherham, after refusing to marry her asylum-seeker ex-boyfriend . Det Supt Fisher said a fingerprint at the flat, CCTV footage and mobile phone records placed Abdollahzadeh at the crime scene. Further evidence of his record of . domestic violence against the victim and property he stole from the flat . linked him to the murder. The Iranian had claimed he spent that night working and then went to a friend's house, and he maintained that alibi in prison. A note was found by his body in . prison. Det Supt Fisher said: 'He didn't admit to the death of Agnieszka . but does not seek to blame anybody else. 'He doesn't offer an alternative alibi and the tone of this letter was more about his self-interest.' Miss Dziegielewska's parents Piotr and Jolanta Mlodzian flew from Poland for the inquest. Mrs Mlodzian said in a statement read . at the inquest that her hard-working daughter had worked at the Maple . Leaf Bakery in Swinton since arriving in the UK four years previously. Miss Dziegielewska and Abdollahzadeh were living together in her Swinton flat by 2008. But their initial happiness turned . sour as her Iranian partner battered and verbally abused the Polish . woman from September 2008 onwards. She was too scared to call in the . police. Her mother, who spoke to her daughter every day by phone said: . 'She was afraid of the consequences and an escalation of the violence on . his side.' When she finally plucked up the . courage to ask her partner to leave he wrote 'I love you' in the snow . outside and bought her flowers and a cake with candles for her 30th . birthday. By this time Miss Dziegielewska had . begun a relationship with Mr Sandhall. Her parents came over from Poland . to help their daughter sort things out with Abdollahzadeh. Mrs Mlodzian said of him: 'He only . cared about himself and nobody else. He considered himself the centre of . the world without giving anything back.' She told the inquest: 'I thought he only wanted to be here to obtain clearance to stay in the UK.' The Iranian finally moved out of the flat on January 15 last year and Miss Dziegielewska changed the locks. On the evening before the Polish woman's death, her mother spoke to her by telephone. She said: 'She was cheerful and happy that things had started to go well with David. She felt safe and respected with him.' Saman Aghababaei, a friend of Abdollahzadeh, said in a statement: 'I never once saw him take her out or buy a present for her. 'I told him he was messing her about. I think he was using her to obtain a visa.' He said she told him she had wasted two years with Abdollahzadeh and wanted the relationship to end. 'She had found someone else she liked and wanted to marry.' Miss Dziegielewska's Polish friend . Agnieszka Blazejewicz told the hearing: 'He began shouting at her and . wouldn't let her go anywhere alone. He wanted to know everything she . did. 'He was very controlling. She gave him chance to change but nothing changed so she asked him to leave.' Ms Blazejewicz later received a . threatening telephone call from Abdollahzadeh. She said: 'He told me if . she leaves he will kill her and then me because I don't help him.' She relayed this to Miss Dziegielewska, who said he had made such threats before. 'He said he would kill her as she could never be with anyone else.' Mr Sandhall called the police when he . got no response to his calls. He last saw Miss Dziegielewska on January . 27 last year as they left work. He said: 'We spoke about each other's feelings and moving in together. We had a kiss and a cuddle and she just drove off.' Miss Dziegielewska's body was found . in her flat the next day. The coroner said it was clear Abdollazadeh had . been violent towards his ex-partner and was reluctant to end the . relationship. She had also invited the killer into . her home 'whether after some persuasion or a degree of reluctance on her . part' as nothing had been disturbed apart from in the bedroom. Ms Mundy said 'she died at the hand of another' and gave a verdict of unlawful killing.","'His last chance of staying in the UK was for him to marry an EU citizen'

"Unpleasant video footage of reinstated Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson has emerged in which he appears to advise young men to marry underage girls because they are easier to control. In the 2009 Sportsmen's Ministry talk, Robertson, 67, who began dating his wife when she was 14-years-old, advises his audience, 'You got to marry these girls when they are 15 or 16. They'll pick your ducks' - which is a literal reference to removing dead bird's feathers. Warming to his stereotypical redneck theme, Robertson, who was suspended from the A&E hit for nine days earlier this month for homophobic comments, tells the gathered crowd that in addition to being young, the girls have to know how to cook and carry a Bible - 'That'll save you a lot of trouble down the road.' Scroll Down to Watch Video: . Controversial again: Video has emerged in which Phil Robertson is seen to advise young men to marry girls as young as 15 to make sure they are supportive wives . While the speech given in Georgia is recounted in a somewhat tongue-in-cheek manner, in light of Robertson's strong views on traditional family values - protected by the First Amendment - they seem slightly inappropriate. His advice for a happy marriage, which he claims is a kind of 'river rat counseling', is that all men 'Make sure that she can cook a meal. You need to eat some meals that she cooks, check that out.' Strongly wagging his Bible during his talk, Robertson, declares that each man marrying his young bride needs to make sure she is a God-fearing woman. 'Make sure she carries her Bible,' preaches the duck call patriarch as he repeats his claim that a lady who plucks ducks - an unsavory task - is a real woman. Watch Video Here: . Strong marriage: Miss Kay and Phil Robertson have been married for 47-years and began dating when she was 14 and he was 18 - they married when he was 20 . Phil Robertson, the patriarch of the ""Duck Dynasty"" TV series, center, leaves the White's Ferry Road Church of Christ in West Monroe, La. on Sunday, Dec. 22, 2013. Robertson was suspended in early December for homophobic comments . To a few uncomfortable laughs, Robertson tries to bring some humor to proceedings by telling the boys they need to check with the girls parents obviously before they marry the 15 or 16-year-old girls. While the age of consent in Robertson's home state of Louisiana is 17, it is legal for marriage to take place with parental consent at the age of 16. However, in his address, the Duck Dynasty star says that guys should catch girls early because waiting makes it harder to find the right one to take care of your ducks. 'Look, you wait until they get to be 20-years-old, the only picking that’s going to take place is your pocket,' said Robertson. 'You got to marry these girls when they are about 15 or 16, they’ll pick your ducks. You need to check with mom and dad about that of course.' The Robertson clan are worth an estimated $15 million based of the back of the Duck Commander that Phil launched back in the 1970's . Robertson, 67, began dating his wife of 47-years, Miss Kay, when she was 14-years-old and he married her in 1966 when he was 20 and she was 16-years-old. This new video has emerged in the wake of A&E lifting his suspension from the cable network's No.1 rated show for his anti-gay and racially provocative comments that Roberston made in an interview with GQ magazine. In the article, Robertson quoted passages from the Bible - calling homosexuality a sin and comparing it to bestiality. His suspension appalled his supporters on the right such as Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Their vocal campaign to make Robertson a victim of political-correctness which had violated his First Amendment rights was successful and he was reinstated. Reinstated: Phil Robertson won't miss a day of filming after his brief hiatus was reversed by A&E . Indeed, over the weekend the Robertson family issued a statement to Fox News saying they are 'excited to keep making a quality TV show for our dedicated fans, who have showed us wonderful support. We will continue to represent our faith and values in a positive way through Duck Dynasty and our many projects that we are currently working on.' 'The outpouring of support and prayers has encouraged and emboldened us greatly,' the family added. The network said in a statement yesterday that they planned to reinstate Phil on the reality show after discussions with the Robertson family and consultations with 'numerous advocacy groups'. Stardom: Two of the unlikely reality TV stars of Duck Dynasty, brothers Silas 'Uncle Si' Robertson (left) and Phil Robertson . But despite this, many spoke out against Phil's reinstatement - the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Discrimination (GLAAD) issuing a statement yesterday to Fox News saying it the network is just greedy to capitalize off the hit show. 'Phil Robertson should look African American and gay people in the eyes and hear about the hurtful impact of praising Jim Crow laws and comparing gay people to terrorists. 'If dialogue with Phil is not part of next steps then A+E has chosen profits over African American and gay people – especially its employees and viewers,' the said. The fourth season is set to premiere this January, and was largely completed before Phil made the statements, meaning he didn't miss a single episode of filming during the ban. The removal of the 67-year-old patriarch from the show was lauded by gay rights organizations, but fans of the show denounced it as a violation of Robertson's right to free speech.","Video of Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson telling an audience at a Georgia Sportsmen's Ministry talk to marry girl's as young as 15 has emerged .

"A University of New Hampshire track and field star hailed as a hero after he quit the team so he can donate bone marrow has given two liters of it to a complete stranger. Cameron Lyle, a senior, grabbed national attention last week when he said he would selflessly end his collegiate track and field career to give the gift of life to a 28-year-old leukemia patient. Mr Lyle does not know the patient's name, but was told that he had been given just six months to live. Selfless: Cameron Lyle shows off his 'Wildcat pride' from his hospital bed at Massachusetts General Hospital, where he donated two liters of bone marrow to a 28-year-old leukemia patient . Sacrifice: Mr Lyle, pictured, is being hailed a hero after he quit his final season so he can donate bone marrow to a stranger suffering from leukemia . The 21-year-old had joined the bone marrow registry back in his sophomore year, but it wasn't until two months ago that he was contacted because he was a 100 per cent match for the man. He said that the choice to donate was a no-brainer, but doing so would mean that the promising shot put, hammer and discus-thrower would have to sit out the rest of the season. Mr Lyle told the Today show: 'I was surprised, I was pretty happy. I said yes right away. And then afterwards I thought about everything that that meant giving up, but I never had a second thought about donating. If I had said no, he wouldn’t have had a match.' Donor: Mr Lyle was contacted because he was a 100 per cent match for a leukemia patient given six months to live . He underwent surgery over the weekend at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston to extract the marrow from his hip. The two-hour procedure, which involves inserting a needle into the hip, collected two liters of bone marrow that was quickly given to the leukemia-stricken man. Mr Lyle told Today that he would get an update on the patient's condition in about a month. But as part of Mr Lyle's recovery, he'll be unable to lift more than 20 pounds over his head for a few weeks, . ruling out the heavy objects he tosses in competition. Both Mr Lyle's mother and team coach were both extremely supportive of his decision. 'He's my hero,' his mom Christine Sciacca said. 'I couldn't be more proud of him and how he's been so humble about it.' But . Lyle said he felt like he had been called into the principal's office . when he went to tell his coach, Jim Boulanger, the news. But he didn't have to worry. 'I . told him, ""you either do 12 throws at the conference championships, or . you give another man a few more years,""' Boulanger told the Eagle Tribune. 'It was easy for me.' The recipient, who is suffering from . acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and Lyle are required by law to remain . anonymous to each other for one year. Team: The choice to donate meant that Mr Lyle, pictured second from right with his teammates, would have to sit out the rest of the season . After a year, Lyle and the recipient . will both have the opportunity to sign consent forms to reveal their . identities to each other. Lyle told the Eagle Tribune: 'I'd . love to meet him some day,' He's not that much older than . myself. I just can't imagine what he's going through.' Despite missing several big meets - including the America East Championships and the Penn Relays - Mr Lyle has no regrets. He told Today: 'It’s OK. It was worth it. I would do it again, too.'

"When the air-raid sirens ring out across Israel, hundreds of thousands of people scramble to the safety of shelters. Taking cover in safe rooms, bomb shelters, and stairwells can be a terrifying experience for many Israeli citizens, but  dozens of teenagers and adults have posted smiling selfies on Facebook to document their experiences. Sara Eisen, a resident of Beit Shemesh in central Israel, set up one of the group's called 'Bomb Shelter Selfies.' Hundreds of Israelis have documented their experiences when they take cover with a bizarre set of smiling selfies which they have posted on Facebook . One image shows a pair of teenagers who were forced to go to the air raid shelter in the middle of a pamper session - one of them is wearing a face-mask while the other is dressed in just a towel . In one snap a young woman is shown standing next to an elderly man in his towel with the caption 'Meet other neighbours in the shelter' 'There’s a selfie for everything so I figured why not bomb shelters?' Eisen told the newspaper Haaretz. She explained the group is a way of 'showing the world that we weren’t letting this get to us.' At first, she recalls 'I wanted to call it ‘Bomb Shelter Bombshells’' - but her husband told her it was over the top. The group has hundreds of photos taken from across the state during the past fortnight - many of them showing Israeli citizens smiling and laughing as they pose for the photos.

But the group has been criticised by internet users who feel it makes a mockery of the rising Palestinian death toll. One user wrote: 'Guess who has no shelters or any safe spot to be in? Children of Gaza. The little charged phones are saved for emergencies rather than taking selfies... Because guess who controls electricity? Israel.' Another wrote: 'Meanwhile, Palestinian women and children don't have the luxury of running to bomb shelters when Israeli bombs fall from the sky.this is not war.this is ethnic cleansing.' But Ms Eisen wrote on the group: 'There are those who allege that the fact that we are smiling / not dead proves that Israelis are not suffering. I will not apologize for being alive, protecting my children.' The 16-day conflict has claimed the lives of 718 Palestinians, most of them civilians, Palestinian health officials say. Israel has lost 32 soldiers, all since July 17, when it widened its air campaign into a full-scale ground operation aimed at halting rocket fire from Gaza and destroying a sophisticated network of cross-border tunnels.","Hundreds of Israelis have documented their experiences on Facebook .

"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke . out publicly for the first time on Monday in favor of immigration . reform, an issue he's been working on behind the scenes for several . months. The 29-year-old billionaire made his remarks in San Francisco at the debut screening of 'Documented,' an autobiographical documentary by activist and journalist Jose Antonio Vargas. Wearing . his trademark hoodie and sneakers, Zuckerberg disputed the notion that . he and other Silicon Valley leaders are just trying to secure more H1B . visas for high-tech workers. Mark Zuckerberg co-founded  Facebook out of his college room. He took a risk by leaving Harvard University after his sophomore year to concentrate on the site . 'This is something that we believe is really important for the future of our country - and for us to do what's right,' Zuckerberg told several hundred attendees, including House Minority . Leader Nancy Pelosi and San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, at the Yerba Buena . Center for the Arts. Zuckerberg . and his former Harvard University roommate Joe Green recently founded . the organization Fwd.us to advocate for a pathway to citizenship for . nearly 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. But Monday was the first time Zuckerberg spoke about the issue in public. The . Facebook Inc. founder said he first became aware of the need to change . the immigration system while volunteering to teach a class on . entrepreneurship at a Menlo Park school. Many of the students had been . brought into the U.S. illegally. Zuckerberg made his remarks in San Francisco at the debut screening of 'Documented,' an autobiographical documentary by activist and journalist Jose Antonio Vargas, right . 'No . matter where they were born, (these students) are going to be . tomorrow's entrepreneurs and people creating jobs in this country,' he told the audience. 'These are issues that don't just touch our part of the industry, but really touch a whole country.' In April, Zuckerberg teamed up with other Silicon Valley leaders to launch Fwd.us, with the aim of revamping immigration policy, boosting education and encouraging investment in scientific research. In an op-ed article in The Washington Post at the time, Zuckerberg said the U.S. needs a new approach to these issues if it is to get ahead economically. This, he wrote, includes offering talented, skilled immigrants a path to citizenship. 'We have a strange immigration policy for a nation of immigrants, Zuckerberg wrote. 'And it's a policy unfit for today's world.' Of Jewish extraction, Zuckerberg's interest in immigration stems from the fact that his own great-grandparents arrived as immigrants via Ellis Island, to America, coupled with his experience teaching entrepreneurship at an after-school program. Fwd.us, Zuckerberg said, was created 'to build . the knowledge economy the United States needs to ensure more jobs, . innovation and investment'. Screen grab of the Fwd.us website . 'My great-grandparents came through Ellis Island. 'My grandfathers were a mailman and a police officer. 'My parents are doctors. I started a company. 'None of this could have happened without a welcoming immigration policy, a great education system and the world’s leading scientific community that created the internet.' At the top of the Fwd.us website it explains in bite-sized facts just why immigration is important to the future of America and reminds users that: '40 per cent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children' and that '57% of engineering grad students are immigrants. Many will have to leave if we don’t pass comprehensive immigration reform.' Zuckerberg also called for higher standards and accountability in schools and increased focus on learning about science, technology, engineering and maths. Today's knowledge and ideas-based economy, the 28-year-old Harvard dropout wrote, is very different from the economy of the 20th century that was based on natural resources, industrial machines and labor. Fwd.us, he said, was created 'to build the knowledge economy the United States needs to ensure more jobs, innovation and investment.' Also backing the group are tech leaders such as Bill Gates, LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman, serial entrepreneur Sean Parker, as well as Ruchi Sanghvi of Dropbox, who was Facebook's first female engineer.

One fatality was reported on Saturday and on Sunday Quebec provincial police said that four more bodies had been recovered. Their identities have not been released. The five tankers were eventually put out with foam on Sunday morning, but the wreckage was still smouldering and firefighters swarmed the area. Due to the massive inferno, firefighters were initially unable to access the Musi-Café, a popular bar where dozens of people were partying when the explosions occurred. They are feared dead, the Globe and Mail reported. The train's conductor, who was in a hotel at the town at the time of the crash, is being questioned by police.

On Saturday night, 163 people stayed in that emergency shelter. Psychological services are being provided to the community. 'It's . difficult for people who still are looking for loved ones,' Myriam . Marotte of the Red Cross told CTV News. 'It's also difficult for people . who don't know what is going to happen in the next couple of hours and . couple of days. Some people have lost everything.'

About 30 shops and homes in the town center, including the library and local weekly newspaper's office, were destroyed by the fire, which is being dealt with by firefighters from Quebec and Maine. 'Words cannot tell the damage that had been done,' Sergeant Gregory Gomez del Prado, of Quebec Police, said. 'Many, many buildings have been damaged. It’s a catastrophe for the town of course, but also for the whole province.' Witnesses said the blast flattened an . apartment building and part of a bar, which had a terrace packed with . people at the time of the fire, according to CBC.

'I saw the wagons come off the tracks ... everything exploded. In just one minute the center of the town was . covered in fire.' The ferocity of the blaze has made authorities fear for the safety of many of the lakeside town's 6,000 residents. About 120 firefighters are still trying to contain the fire in the town center. 'When you see the center of your town . almost destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we . are going to get through this event,' the town's mayor, Colette . Roy-Laroche, said. 'We're told some people are missing but . they may just be out of town or on vacation,' Lieutenant Michel Brunet, . of Quebec police, said. A Facebook page has been set up to help friends and family check on their loved ones, according to the Toronto Star. Locator: The Montreal Maine & Atlantic train derailed about 250km from Montreal . Devastation: Residents said the explosion looked the the end of the world, as thick smoke and flames filled the sky . Rescue: As the town was evacuated on Saturday morning, residents watched in horror as the fire spread . Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper has sent his sympathy to the stricken town and is expected to visit later on Sunday. 'Thoughts & prayers are with those impacted in Lac Megantic. Horrible news,' he said on Twitter. Flames . could be seen from several miles away as the fire spread to several . homes after the 73-car Montreal Maine & Atlantic train, which was . heading towards Maine, derailed. Zeph Kee, who lives about half an hour from Lac-Megantic, told CBC: 'It was total mayhem ... people not finding their kids.' Resident Anne-Julie Hallee, who saw the explosion, said: 'It was like the end of the world.' Another resident, Claude Bedard, said: 'It's terrible. We've never seen anything like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is gone.' Only 1,000 litres of oil on board the . train has been recovered, and firefighters said that all of the 73 cars . were on fire, according to a press conference held in the town on . Saturday afternoon. A . lot of the oil has leaked into a lake and the Chaudiere River, and . plumes of thick smoke could be seen from about 10km away, nearly 10 . hours after the blast. Still burning: Flames and smoke pour from one of the wagons hours after the derailment . Doused: Water is sprayed on to a burning rail car close to the railway track . Rubble: The remains of a building flattened in the blast can be seen through the smoke . Pollution: Environmental workers are monitoring the plumes of smoke, as well as contamination of a river . A 1km section of the town has been cordoned off and boats have been banned from coming close on the river, after flames were allegedly seen in two aqueducts. 'We have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of the air,' Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said. 'Firefighters are working hard to extinguish that fire, but it’s burning hard because of the crude oil,' Gergeant Gomez del Prado said,adding that it would take a while for the fire to be contained. 'We also have a spill on the lake and . the river that is concerning us. We have advised the local . municipalities downstream to be careful if they take their water from . the Chaudiere River.' Firefighters . have set up a perimeter around the town as they try to tackle the . blaze, which was caused when four of the cars that were pressurized blew . up. 'There are still wagons which we think are pressurized. We're not sure because we can't get close, so we're working on the assumption that all the cars were pressurized and could explode. That's why progress is slow and tough,' local fire chief Denis Lauzon said. The cause of the derailment is not yet known. The railway company's Mr McGonigle, said the middle section of the train had derailed, the Montreal Gazette said. Investigators are headed to the town to begin gathering information and statements from witnesses.","About 30 buildings destroyed and 40 people missing in Lac Megantic .

"A brave teenager armed only with a simple hunting knife faced down a rapist trying to break into his home last week, proving himself a hero to his younger brother and sister and the the man's victim. Entrusted by his father to babysit while he ran an errand to the family business around 10 p.m., James Persyn, 14, was startled by the frantic screaming and banging of a woman at the front door of their Shepherd, Michigan home on Wednesday night. Letting the desperate woman inside, five-foot-eight, 142-pound James rushed her, his 11-year-old sister and two-year-old brother into an upstairs bathroom before arming himself with his weapon, ready to defy the rapist who by now was screaming 'Let me in or I'll kill you.' James Persyn III, 14, holds the knife he had on Wednesday night while posing for a picture with his sister Acelin Persyn, 11, at their Shepherd, Michigan home . 'Her voice was, like, she was going to die if I didn't open that door,' said James about the terrified woman pounding on his door. 'A lot of people, maybe most people, would've been like, 'Get the hell off my porch.' Despite this, James opened his door and as he did so, the woman charged in, ran to the kitchen and hid according to the Detroit Free Press. 'I let her in, and she asked me if my parents were home. I told her no. She said, 'We’ve got to hide. I was just kidnapped, and I’ve just jumped out of a vehicle. We’ve got to hide now.' Eric Ramsey, 30, of Mt. Pleasant was paroled in July 2012 after being convicted of assaulting a police officer and destruction of property . The unidentified woman, a senior at Central Michigan University had been walking to her car in the school parking lot when Eric Ramsey, 30, an ex-convict approached her with a gun, forced her into her car and then took her to his mother's house and raped her. Leaping from the vehicle as Ramsey was driving towards South Mission, the lady arrived at the Persyn residence covered in cuts and bruises and holding an arm she said was broken from the jump. She said that she had seen the little house with its porch light in the darkness and ran straight towards it. Just as suddenly as she had appeared though James looked out of the window and saw Ramsey driving up the long, winding driveway . The terrified teen locked the front door and ran to the side door to lock it too. He then shepherded his sister Acelin and brother Angus along with the female victim into the bathroom to hide. Tiffany Ramon, 28 and James Persyn Snr., 36 pose for a photo outside of their home by their burnt siding . Fetching his hunting knife from his bedroom, James also grabbed the family Labrador and put him in the bathroom, all the while Ramsey was screaming 'Let me in or I'll kill you' as he tried top break-in. Reaching for his cell phone, James told his dad, 'We need help right now. There's a man outside our door trying to get in, and I'm really afraid.' But as their father rushed as fast as he could, Acelin continued to call for her brother. 'I wanted him to come in the bathtub with me and just hug each other and say good-bye,' she said. 'I didn't know what was going to happen, if we didn't make it, if he actually did make it in here and my dad didn't get home in time.' However, Ramsey ceased trying to smash his way into the house and grabbed a can of gas from the vehicle, poured it around the base of the base, lit it and drove off. Failing to set the house alight, Ramsey fled the scene just before James Snr. arrived home to save his children. At the same time, a sheriff's deputy pulled up to the house and upon seeing the frantic flailing man trying to get into the house drew his gun. 'I'm the dad! I'm the dad!' James Jr. shouted. Rampage: Eric Ramsey, 30, of central Michigan, 'abducted a college student at gunpoint, raped her, set fire to a house, stole a flatbed truck, rammed three police cars' before police shot him dead . The deputies interviewed the victim and the kids before the woman was taken away by ambulance. Later that evening, the terrified Persyn family got word that Ramsey's rampage had ended nearby after he was shot dead by police officers. But that was not before he updated his Facebook status after a night of horror in central Michigan after he abducted a female college student at gunpoint, raped her, attempted to set fire to a house, stole a flatbed truck and rammed three police cars on Wednesday. ‘Well folkes im about to get shot. Peace,’ read the message that the suspect Eric Ramsey, 30, posted to his Facebook page from his cell phone moments before he was shot to death by a sheriff's deputy. ‘I've been in this community for 35 years,’ Central Michigan University Police Chief Bill Yeagley told the Detroit Free Press. ‘I don't remember anything like this.’ Police say the rampage started around 9:30 p.m. last Wednesday as the student, a senior from the Grand Rapids area, walked to her Ford Escape, which was parked in a lot just outside of the Student Activities Center in the middle of CMU's Mt. Pleasant campus. ‘We don't know what possessed him to do that. We may never find out,’ said Isabella County Sheriff Leo Mioduszewski. Mioduszewski said Ramsey drove the woman in her own vehicle to a home off campus and bound and raped her there. He said Ramsey then put her back in the Ford Escape and pledged to kill her, but she escaped the moving vehicle and ran to a home yelling for help. Bizarre: 'I've been in this community for 35 years,' Central Michigan University Police Chief Bill Yeagley told the Detroit Free Press. 'I don't remember anything like this.' While the woman was inside the home talking to an emergency dispatcher on the phone, Ramsey ‘ended up pouring gasoline on the house and then lit on fire,’ Mioduszewski said in a statement. A 14-year-old boy, his 11-year-old sister and 2-year-old brother were alone inside the home in nearby Lincoln Township when the woman banged on the door for help. The teenager, James Persyn III, told Mlive.com that he let the woman in, locked the door and grabbed his hunting knife. He said he while the woman was using his phone to call 911, he moved her, his siblings and the family dog into the bathroom. Meanwhile, the sheriff said, ‘one of the homeowners arrived home ... and was able to put the fire out,’ using an extinguisher. Ramsey was spotted early Thursday last week in Otsego County, where he rammed the first of two state police cars. The sheriff said he subsequently stole a garbage truck and was fatally shot by a deputy in Crawford County, about 70 miles north of the university. Campus police Chief Bill Yeagley said Ramsey told the woman that he chose her at random outside the Student Activity Center on campus. The message: 'Well folkes im about to get shot. Peace,' read the message that he posted to his Facebook page moments before he was shot and killed by a sheriff's deputy . The chief said the woman saved her own life by fleeing from the car. ‘I believe she made all the right choices,’ Yeagley said. ‘She's the true hero in this.’ Central Michigan University President George Ross said the school would support the Grand Rapids-area woman and her family. Ramsey had been on parole since last summer after serving the minimum five-year prison sentence for assault with intent to do great bodily harm, according to Corrections Department online records. The maximum sentence was 15 years. Inmates are eligible for a parole review once they serve the minimum punishment. ‘The parole board generally doesn't give a rationale for why or why they don't parole (an inmate),’ said Russ Marlan, a Corrections Department spokesman. ‘I looked at his behavior in prison. He was pretty good. He had six misconducts over five years. That's a small amount. He was in minimum security the entire time.’ Ramsey had a job, regularly met with his parole officer and had tested negative for drugs, Marlan said. His record also included convictions for destruction of police or fire property, resisting police and assault with a dangerous weapon.","James Persyn hurried his sister and brother into the bathroom after he let a desperate rape victim into his house as her attacker pursued her .

"Australia could be forced to put troops on the ground in Syria if it wants to defeat the Islamic State, Australia's defence chief has said in a chilling warning. Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, believes that the terrorist organisation will at some point have to be defeated 'on the battlefield', Fairfax Media reports. He said the Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaeda which is fighting in Syria and Iraq, is 'not undefeatable'. Air Marshal Binskin also reportedly said the situation is 'bigger than Iraq'. Scroll down for video . Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin has said the Islamic State may need to be defeated with Australian troops on the ground . The news comes as The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Australia may support a potential US military mission to bomb ISIS targets in Syria. An official reportedly told the paper that President Barack Obama wants to expand the campaign against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. In a speech to the American Legion in North Carolina, Mr Obama said: 'Rooting out a cancer like ISIL won't be easy, and it won't be quick.' Australia, Britain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are all thought to be allies that the US will try and enlist for the mission. The Australian government has already compiled a dossier of the atrocities committed by ISIS against civilians across Syria and Iraq, News Corp reports. A member loyal to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is seen here waving an ISIL flag in Raqqa June 29, 2014. The offshoot of al Qaeda has captured swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced the government will pour $64 million into measures to 'counter violent extremism and radicalisation' An estimated 60 Australians are currently believed to be fighting with extremists in Syria and Iraq. The government believes there are a further 100 'facilitators' in Australia. This week Mr Abbott announced the government would pour $64 million into measures to 'counter violent extremism and radicalisation'. And on Thursday it emerged anti-terror officers have arrested a suspected terrorist bound for Syria at Melbourne Airport after he was allegedly found carrying images of beheadings and the ISIL flag. The man, who is an Australian citizen, was allegedly also carrying $30,000 and was with three family members when he was detained on a flight travelling to Beirut, Lebanon on Monday, the Herald Sun reported. This comes after another man was arrested at Sydney Airport on Sunday after material related to the Islamic State was found in his luggage.","Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, said the Islamic State is 'not undefeatable'

"A Dallas nurse who recovered from Ebola has been reunited with her dog Bentley, who has spent 21 days in quarantine. The King Charles Cavalier spaniel has undergone twice-daily check-ups by vets in hazmat suits at a secret naval base while his owner, Nina Pham, was treated for the deadly virus. This morning, the pair were reunited privately on Saturday at the secret location near the Texan city where he had been isolated since she fell ill. Scroll down for video . Together again! Nina Pham, 26, clutches Bentley as he is released from quarantine after 21 days . Thankful: The former Ebola patient thanked vets for treating him as their own while she was in hospital . Private reunion: Pham traveled to the naval base this morning to retrieve Bentley from his isolation unit . Smiles: Pham posed excitedly with her 'best friend' Mr Bentley and one of the vets that cared for him . As Pham, 26, underwent blood transfusions and hospital transfers to tackle the deadly virus, Bentley underwent twice-daily check-ups by vets in hazmat suits at the decommissioned naval air base near Dallas. Tearful, Pham said at a news conference Saturday that she was thankful for the thoughts and prayers for 'me and Mr Bentley,' whom she called 'one of my best friends.' Pham was diagnosed with Ebola last month. She contracted the virus while caring for the Liberian patient Thomas Eric Duncan, who died on October 8. City spokeswoman Sana Syed said on Thursday that the dog has tested negative for Ebola and that his 21-day quarantine — the Ebola incubation period — ends Saturday. Pham recovered and was released October 24 from a Washington, D.C.-area hospital. Ebola free: Bentley, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel belonging to cured Ebola patient Nina Pham, has been release from quarantine. Pictured above in a snap shared by Dallas Animal Services on Thursday . Where's Nina? Pham had not been allowed to visit her dog as it could have caused Bentley to become anxious . Under observation: Workers in hazmat suits removed Bentley from Pham's home, and took him to a special isolation room at a nearby naval base. He has been treated by veterinarians and other workers every day. On Thursday he tested negative for Ebola for a third time . Pham was one of two nurses to contract Ebola after treating Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. Nurse Amber Vinson has also been cured of the deadly disease which has currently claimed nearly 5,000 lives, mainly in the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. That leaves only one person currently being treated for Ebola in the U.S. Dr Craig Spencer of New York is currently being treated for the disease in an isolation wing at Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital. He came down the disease less than a week after returning from West Africa where he was performing aid work with Doctors Without Borders. Ms Pham was the first Ebola patient in the U.S. to have been in contact with a pet as she came down with the virus. Nurse's best friend: Pham's beloved dog has been in quarantine since just after she admitted herself to the hospital with a high temperature . Happy: Pham contracted the disease after volunteering to treat U.S. Ebola patient-zero Thomas Eric Duncan. She has since recovered from the deadly disease. Pictured above giving a hug to President Barack Obama on October 24 . While dogs are not known to be the virus' natural carriers, it's still unclear whether they indeed spread it to humans if they've come into contact with someone who is infected. In Spain, those questions caused officials to put down the dog of nurse there who became infected. Excalibur, who belonged to Spanish nurse and Ebola patient Teresa Romero, was destroyed days after Romero was diagnosed. The move sparked widespread outrage and mass protests in the streets of Madrid - as Romero was later cleared of the virus. Pham's family revealed they pleaded with the district judge to let Bentley survive.

The announcement comes as hundreds of migrants are feared dead after a boat carrying a reported 400 people sank off the coast off the coast of southern Italy.

Warning: The tragedy comes after Libya's interim interior minister Salah Mazek said the North African country could not cope under the strain of thousands of sub-Saharan Africans passing through it . At least 210 of the passengers have been rescued by the Italian coast guard following the sinking, but 15 bodies have already been pulled from the sea and more than 100 are still missing. A statement from the Italian Navy said 'A boat filled with migrants sank a few hours ago off the Libyan coast.' 'A helicopter has been dispatched and two warships are headed to the area at maximum speed to lend assistance.' The coast guard was alerted to the incident by a boat involved in offshore oil extraction in the area, Italian media said. The tragedy follows a threat from the Libyan government to 'facilitate' illegal immigrants seeking to reach Europe from the country’s shores.

Women and children, part of some 340 illegal migrants who were rescued by the Libyan navy off the coast of the western town of Sabratha . Libya has long been a springboard for Africans seeking a better life in Europe, and the number of illegal departures from its shores is rising . Interior Minister Salah Mazek said that the North African country could not cope under the strain of thousands of sub Saharan Africans transiting through Libya insisting it was ‘Europe’s turn to pay the price.’ Libya, still mired in chaos after the failure of the Arab Spring, is the gateway for hundreds of thousands of migrants seeking a new life in Europe. Around 800,000 would-be migrants are poised on Libya’s coastline to make the crossing to Europe, ferried by gangs of human traffickers, the Italian government has warned. In the first four months of this year 25,000 migrants have landed in Italy, the closest European landfall to Libya, around ten fold last year's figure. Most plan to make their way to northern Europe. One in five eventually settle in the UK, British investigators say. Tribute: Last year, on his first official trip outside Rome, Pope Francis laid a wreath in the sea near Lampedusa in memory of those immigrants who have lost their lives in the crossing . Mr Mazek said that Libya could not cope with the 'flood'  and would move the migrants on. He told a news conference at the weekend: 'I’m warning the world and Europe in particular - if they do not assume their responsibilities, Libya could facilitate the transit of this flood of immigrants towards Europe.' He said Libya was 'suffering' because of problems created by the mainly sub-Saharan Africans were spreading disease, crime and drugs in the North African nation. 'Libya has paid the price. Now it’s Europe’s turn to pay,' Mazek added. At least 38 migrants perished in a shipwreck off the coast of Tripoli at the weekend, with dozens more feared dead. The hull gave way 4km off shore because of the crush of people on board the boat which was carrying migrants from Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Gambia, Mali and Senegal. Sea patrols have been stepped up following the tragic drowning of more than 300 migrants off the Italian island of Lampedusa last year. Most boats are now intercepted by coastguard or Naval ships, often hundreds of miles from shore. But while the policy has saved lives, the Italian government says it has also helped traffickers by making the journey shorter and  cheaper, encouraging more crossings.","Accident happened around 100 miles south of Italian island of Lampedusa .

"An extract found in shiitake mushrooms can kill the HPV virus which causes cervical cancer . Everyone knows that mushrooms are a nutritious and low-calorie addition to a meal but now new research suggests they could also combat cancer. An extract from a Japanese mushroom kills the sexually transmitted virus HPV that can cause cervical cancer. Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a common, and highly contagious, infection that affects skin and the moist membrane linings of the body, for example, in the cervix, mouth and throat. More than three quarters of all women acquire the virus during their lives and some strains can cause cervical cancer. But American research found the extract active hexose correlated compound (AHCC) – which is found in shiitake mushrooms - may play a role in preventing HPV-related cancers. In a study using mice, AHCC led to the eradication of HPV within 90 days. It also decreased the rate of cervical tumour growth. Associate professor Dr Judith Smith, of the University of Texas Health Science Center Medical School, said: ‘The results of this study were very encouraging. ‘This study, initiated in 2008, shows that by itself AHCC has the potential to treat the HPV infection.’ AHCC works as an immunotherapy, which is a treatment that uses a body's own immune system to help fight disease. Human and lab studies have shown that AHCC increases the number and activity of Natural Killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and cytokines, which enable the body to effectively respond to infections and block the proliferation of tumours. HPV DNA has been detected in 99.7 per cent of cervical cancer biopsies, yielding the largest causative relationship of any cancer. Several other types of cancer are also HPV related, including 95 per cent of anal cancers, 60 per cent of throat cancers, 65 per cent of vaginal cancers, 50 per cent of vulvar cancers and 35 per cent of penile cancers. The extract can also slow down the development of cervical tumours. Image shows the HPV virus . Dr Smith said: ‘AHCC is a common, well tolerated nutritional supplement that has been used for decades in Japan. I am very excited to be pursuing a nutritional approach to trying to find a treatment for HPV infections. ‘We had previously demonstrated an antiretroviral regimen that successfully eradicated the HPV infection but wanted to develop a more benign protocol, since these medications have a number of side effects.’ The findings were presented at the Society of Gynecological Oncology 45th Annual Meeting on Women's Cancer in Tampa, Florida.","An extract in Japanese shiitake mushrooms kills the HPV virus .

"Top medical experts studying the spread of Ebola say the public should expect more cases to emerge in the United States by year's end as infected people arrive here from West Africa, including American doctors and nurses returning from the hot zone and people fleeing from the deadly disease. No one knows for sure how many infections will emerge in the U.S. or anywhere else, but scientists have made educated guesses based on data models that weigh hundreds of variables, including daily new infections in West Africa, airline traffic worldwide and transmission possibilities. This week, several top infectious disease experts ran simulations  that predicted as few as one or two additional infections by the end of 2014 to a worst-case scenario of 130. Concern: Members of the Brooklyn Borough President's office hand out fliers detailing the risks of Ebola. Medical experts say the public should expect more cases by the end of this year . 'I don't think there's going to be a huge outbreak here, no,' said Dr. David Relman, a professor of infectious disease, microbiology and immunology at Stanford University's medical school. 'However, as best we can tell right now, it is quite possible that every major city will see at least a handful of cases.' Relman is a founding member of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services advisory board for biosecurity and chairs the National Academy of Sciences forum on microbial threats. Until now, projections published in top medical journals by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control have focused on worst-case scenarios for West Africa, concluding that cases in the U.S. will be episodic, but minimal. But they have declined to specify actual numbers. The projections are complicated, but Ebola has been a fairly predictable virus — extremely infectious, contagious only through contact with body fluids, requiring no more than 21 days for symptoms to emerge. Human behavior is far less predictable — people get on airplanes, shake hands, misdiagnose, even lie. Pandemic risk expert Dominic Smith, a senior manager for life risks at Newark, California-based RMS, a leading catastrophe-modeling firm, ran a U.S. simulation this week that projected 15 to 130 cases between now and the end of December. That's less than one case per 2 million people. Smith's method assumes that most cases imported to the U.S. will be American medical professionals who worked in West Africa and returned home. Warning: Health alerts regarding people who may have traveled to particular West African countries are posted in the lobby of Bellevue Hospital, where Dr Craig Spencer is being treated . Smith said the high end may be a bit of an overestimate as it does not include the automatic quarantining measures that some areas in the U.S. are implementing. Those quarantines 'could both reduce the number of contacts for imported cases, as well as increase the travel burden on — and perhaps reduce the number of — U.S. volunteers planning to support the effort in West Africa,' he said. In a second simulation, Northeastern University professor Alessandro Vespignani projected between one case — the most likely scenario — and a slim chance of as many as eight cases though the end of November. 'I'm always trying to tell people to keep calm and keep thinking rationally,' said Vespignani, who projects the spread of infectious diseases at the university's Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-Technical Systems. Citizens: Dr Craig Spencer (left) is currently being treated after being diagnosed with the deadly virus while Nurse Kaci Hickox was quarantined after returning from West Africa . In an article in the journal PLOS ONE, Vespignani and a team of colleagues said the probability of international spread outside the African region is small, but not negligible. Longer term, they say international dissemination will depend on what happens in West Africa in the next few months. Their first analysis, published Sept. 2, proved to be accurate when it included the U.S. among 30 countries likely to see some Ebola cases. They projected one or two infections in the U.S., but there could be as many as 10. So far, nine Ebola patients have been treated in the U.S., and one has died. Seven became infected in West Africa, including Thomas Eric Duncan, the first to arrive undiagnosed and the first to die. He was cared for at a Dallas hospital, where two of his nurses were also infected. Duncan, who was initially misdiagnosed and sent home from the emergency room, is Vespignani's worst-case scenario for the U.S. A similar situation, if left unchecked, could lead to a local cluster that could infect, on the outside, as many as 20, he said. The foreseeable future extends only for the next few months. After that, projections depend entirely on what happens in West Africa. One scenario is that the surge in assistance to the region brings the epidemic under control and cases peter out in the U.S. A second scenario involves Ebola spreading unchecked across international borders. Victim: Thomas Eric Duncan was the first person to die on US soil after being infected with Ebola . 'My worry is that the epidemic might spill into other countries in Africa or the Middle East, and then India or China. That could be a totally different story for everybody,' Vespignani said. Dr. Ashish Jha, a Harvard University professor and director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said he's not worried about a handful of new cases in the U.S. His greatest worry is if the disease goes from West Africa to India. 'If the infection starts spreading in Delhi or Mumbai, what are we going to do?' Dr. Peter Hotez, founding dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, pegs the range of cases in the U.S. between five and 100. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prefers not to focus on a particular number. But spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said Ebola will not be a widespread threat as some outside the agency have warned. 'We're talking about clusters in some places but not outbreaks,' she said. The CDC is using modeling tools to work on projections in West Africa, but 'there isn't enough data available in the U.S. to make it worthwhile to go through the exercise.' University of Texas integrative biology professor Lauren Ancel Meyers said there are inherent inconsistencies in forecasting 'because the course of action we're taking today will impact what happens in the future.' Her laboratory is running projections of Ebola's spread in West Africa. The U.S. simulations run for the AP had fairly consistent results with each other, she said. And they are 'consistent with what we know about the disease.'","Rise in cases will be caused by those infected returning from West Africa .

"The United States may still be on high alert for Ebola - but that didn't stop Saturday Night Live turning its comedic talents to mocking efforts to control the spread of the disease. The show made light of the fiasco over whether to quarantine Kaci Hickox - which ended up in an imagined fistfight between her and Chris Christie, the New Jersey Governor who implemented the harsh new rules. The opening skit on the NBC show began with 'Governor Christie', played by Bobby Moynihan, trying to explain his compulsory quarantine rules, which were briefly applied to any health workers returning from West Africa. Ebola fist-fight: In the sketch, SNL imagined Chris Christie going toe-to-toe with quarantine-defying nurse Kaci Hickox . When asked whether the measures were 'inhumane', Moynihan didn't mince his words. He responded: 'With all due respect, you need to shut the hell up. She got a tent in a parking lot with her own porta-potty – in New Jersey that’s a luxury condo.' Confronted with claims he had backed down after the CDC and President Obama turned on him, he pugnacious Governor-figure went on: 'That’s a bunch of malarky – our policy has not changed: if you present symptoms you will be quarantined. Ebola? Just kidding! Kate KcKinnon, playing Hickox, coughed before talking about how she had been handing out candy and visited a 'kissing booth' - referring to possible methods of spreading the disease . 'But if I then get a call from President Barack Obama...', he continued, before a meandering anecdote of when he met the President during Hurricane Sandy. The scene later  returned to Ebola, cutting to 'Hickox' - played by Kate McKinnon, at her home in Maine. Explaining her defiance of voluntary quarantines, she introduced herself as: 'Kaci with an I as in ""I don’t care if I have Ebola I’m riding my damn bike!"" Consistent until its not: Christie, played by Bobby Moynihan, admitted he caved to demands from Obama . 'I’ve been doing whatever I feel like, took a dip in a public pool, volunteered at a kissing booth. For Halloween I handed out about 1000 loose M&Ms with my bare hands.' When asked whether her actions were 'cavalier', she plowed on: 'Many people are intimidated by a smart, strong women who has lost her mind! 'I stood up to Ebola, I’m not going to be scared off by a governor who looks like a cartoon on a pizza box.' At the mention of his name, Moynihan's Christie appeared miraculously. When asked how he got from New York to Maine in seconds, he brushed of the inconsistency, saying: 'I’m Chris Christie, I’m everywhere!' A brief war of words then devolved into a fistfight between the political heavyweight and incorrigible nurse.","Bobby Moynihan took on guide of New Jersey head Chris Christie in sketch .

"Sir David Bell, trustee of the bureau behind the Newsnight report that led to the smearing of Lord McAlpine . Disturbing questions have been raised about the role of a senior adviser to the Leveson Inquiry. Sir David Bell is on the six-strong panel of assessors assisting Lord Justice Leveson, whose report into press standards is expected within weeks. But a Daily Mail investigation has uncovered evidence that questions both his suitability as an adviser and the impact this may have had on the objectivity and neutrality of the Inquiry. Sir David is a trustee of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the group behind the disastrous Newsnight report that falsely implicated Lord McAlpine as a paedophile. With his lawyers preparing to sue the BIJ for damages, the former Tory Party treasurer yesterday described the devastating impact on him of the programme that has left the BBC in crisis, with the resignation of its director general. The 70-year-old spoke of how the shattering allegations had consigned him ‘to the lowest circle of hell’ and said it had made him ‘a figure of public hatred’. The BBC last night agreed to pay Lord McAlpine £185,000 plus legal costs. This was followed by a grudging apology from the BIJ, which read: ‘The bureau’s trustees apologise to Lord McAlpine for the extent to which its contribution to the Newsnight broadcast on 2 November fell short of the high standards it expects and for any incorrect speculation about the identity of the politician that may have been encouraged by the bureau managing editor’s tweet in advance of the broadcast.’ At the Leveson Inquiry, the BIJ, which bragged it was the gold standard of investigative journalism, proposed a media levy that would force newspapers to fund groups such as itself. As well as the bureau, Sir David is co-founder of the Media Standards Trust, the lobby group behind a huge amount of evidence presented to the Leveson inquiry. The Trust, which Sir David chaired until recently, subsequently spawned Hacked Off – the campaign group demanding press reform fronted by actor Hugh Grant and comedian Steve Coogan – which has boasted of its role in considerably expanding the Inquiry’s original remit. Sir David’s friend and Trust co-founder is Julia Middleton with whom he heads an organisation called Common Purpose which receives millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money from public servants sent on ‘leadership’ training courses. It is described as the Left’s answer to the old boys’ network. Sir David Bell is co-founder of Media Standards Trust. People associated with the trust gave some of the most vehement anti-press evidence at Leveson . A number of prominent politicians and public figures have expressed concern over Lord Leveson's (pictured) inquiry into press standards calls for statutory regulation . Two more of Leveson’s panel of advisers, ex-Ofcom chairman Lord Currie and Sir Paul Scott-Lee, ex-chief constable of West Midlands Police, have indirect connections with Common Purpose. The Mail investigation has uncovered an incestuous network of political, business and financial links between Sir David, ex-chairman of the Financial Times, and individuals and organisations appearing before the Inquiry to demand statutory press regulation. It reveals: . Tory MP Philip Davies, who sits on the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said: ‘This is about a lot of people of dubious intentions setting up organisations to push their own opinions and inveigle their way into positions of influence. They are simply promoting their own ideological agenda in a surreptitious manner. ‘It makes you wonder, if we had statutory regulation of the press, just who would be sitting on such a body.’ Common Purpose, which once shared the same headquarters as the Media Standards Trust, charges up to £5,000 for a week-long course and claims more than 35,000 have ‘graduated’ in the UK and worldwide. The BBC spent more than £126,000 in a five-year period on its courses. Among senior police officer ‘graduates’ of Common Purpose is Cressida Dick, the Scotland Yard commander in charge of the bungled operation that ended with the 2005 shooting of innocent Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes. It was Miss Dick who personally chose Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers to head the investigation into phone-hacking and payments to police and public officials at News International. Power: Philip Davies MP raised concerns about the impartiality of those who would oversee regulation of the press . Another lucrative connection between the police and Common Purpose involves the West Midlands Force. The force sent 27 West Midlands officers, including one assistant chief constable, on Common Purpose courses under Sir Paul Scott-Lee’s leadership. New Labour peer Lord Currie was the first chairman of Ofcom and the media regulator also sent people on the courses. Two of his board members have been involved with either the Media Standards Trust or Hacked Off. The Mail sent detailed questions to Sir David, Lord Currie and Sir Paul but none replied. The Leveson Inquiry issued a statement on their behalf, saying: ‘Before the assessors were formally appointed to their role they were each asked to declare any issues they felt might cause a conflict to arise with their position on the Inquiry. ‘As part of that process, each assessor discussed those matters with Lord Justice Leveson and provided a written declaration accordingly. ‘He was satisfied then that there was nothing in their disclosures which caused him concern or justified any of them not taking up this role.’ Common Purpose chief executive Miss Middleton said: ‘I am proud of my private and personal association with the Media Standards Trust, started by many people in response to widespread feelings that increased transparency in the media should be encouraged.’ She said none of the organisations she was connected with had a role in selecting the assessors.","Sir David Bell's suitability as senior adviser to Leveson Inquiry under scrutiny .

"A 40-year-old British woman was being quizzed last night by detectives as part of an investigation into an alleged plot to blow up an Italian synagogue. Counter-terrorism officers swooped on an address in south London just before dawn yesterday after intelligence from Italian police suggested she had been discussing weapons and explosives on Facebook with a suspected Islamic extremist accused of planning an atrocity in Milan. Last night Scotland Yard was liaising with Italian police to establish whether the woman was linked to Mohamed Jarmoune, 20, who was arrested yesterday in Brescia, northern Italy. 'Target': Italian detectives believe the woman may have been in contact with a man involved in an alleged terror plot to attack Via Della Guastalla synagogue in Milan . Questioning: Police revealed that the Moroccan suspect had images of the synagogue stored on the hard drive of his computer . He is suspected of plotting an attack on a Jewish synagogue in Milan. Police said they had found images of the target on his computer and a document, 'noting every detail' about the building. Italian police believe he created seven 'super secret' Facebook profiles to discuss terror tactics. Officers in Brescia said they had . intercepted messages on extremist websites and discussion boards in . which Jarmoune allegedly spoke of carrying out a 'jihad mission'. Italian police claimed the woman in . London had been in regular 'electronic contact' through  Facebook with . Mr Jarmoune, but they had not physically met. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Her arrest is in connection with an alleged posting of extremist material on the Internet.' Officers took away several items including his computer as well as several Nazi flags that were found in the apartment, which was in the centre of city and which has been the scene of several anti terror investigations in the past. Suspect: Mohamed Jarmoune is suspected of setting up hidden Facebook groups that could be accessed only through a complicated system of controls . Police said Jarmoune had lived in Italy since he was six years old but he had 'come across their radar' as part of another investigation and when they began investigating his background discovered he had been looking at several Islamic extremist websites. He was being held on suspicion of plotting an attack on the Jewish synagogue in Milan with the use of information that he had downloaded from the internet and police revealed he had images of the building stored on the hard drive of his computer. He had detailed security measures for the synagogue and a pencil diagram appeared to show a series of four gas canisters connected to a battery, which was also linked to a mobile telephone, while other images showed the preparation of explosives. An Italian police source said that the Scotland Yard investigation was 'parallel' to the one in Britain and that she had been 'discovered' by detectives in London. Anti terrorist officers in Brescia also said that they had intercepted messages on various Islamic extremist websites and discussion boards, from Jarmoune in which he spoke of carrying out a 'jihad mission'. Extremist items: An Italian police officer with items taken from Jarmoune's address, including several Nazi flags. The apartment was in the centre of city and has been the scene of several anti terror investigations in the past . Probe: Brescia's police chief Lucio Carluccio, centre, spoke about the arrest during a news conference . Brescia police chief Lucio Carluccio said: 'We are not talking about a traditional criminal terror organisation, those groups are now fewer and fewer but what we are talking about is isolated groups springing up of young men who contact each other via the internet. 'They use these message boards and discussion groups to discuss terrorism with the message being to strike whenever and wherever you can. The information obtained from his computer was very detailed and very specifically about the synagogue in Milan. 'The investigation also discovered that he was in contact with the woman in London via one of the Facebook accounts and she has been held by colleagues in Britain who are carrying out their own investigation. What we do know is that they were in contact on Facebook discussing arms and explosives.'

"American Special Forces commandos are on the ground fighting in northern Iraq, according to a published report, just a week after Barack Obama said that wouldn't happen.  And with a second brutal beheading in Syria ,the president may soon have to decide how much more military might to deploy. Even as he has authorized more than 100 target airstrikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) in Iraq, Obama told the American Legion on August 26 that 'American combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq.' 'I will not allow the United States to be dragged back into another ground war in Iraq,' he said, adding later that 'the answer' to ISIS 'is not to send in large-scale military deployments that overstretch our military.' His parsing of words – 'combat troops' and 'large-scale' – now seem calculated to produce platoon-sized loopholes. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Kurds to the rescue: Peshmerga fighters (pictured) have proven fierce adversaries of ISIS in northern Iraq, and their commanders are now confirming that US troops are on the ground helping . Careful parsing: 'American combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq,' Barack Obama said a week ago during a speech in Charlotte, North Carolina to the American Legion . A Daily Beast freelance reporter wrote Tuesday that he saw 'what appeared to be bearded Western Special Operations Forces' in a caravan of armored vehicles near the Iraqi town of Zumar. The battle-scarred location, 30 miles from Mosul and a bit further from Erbil, had been the site of fierce fighting between Kurdish Peshmerga forces and ISIS militants. 'They didn't wear any identifying insignia,' the reporter added, 'but they were visibly Western and appeared to match all the visual characteristics of American special operations soldiers.' This particular freelancer should know: He's a 27-year-old former U.S. Army Ranger who served three tours in Iraq and two in Afghanistan. A Peshmerga commander, backed up by Kurdish intelligence sources, confirmed that 'Yes, German and American forces are on the ground here. They are helping to support us in the attack.' But the Pentagon told the online news magazine Monday night that 'there are no U.S. troops on the ground in or around Zumar.' A spokesman for U.S. Central Command said no American troops were involved in fighting there but a single airstrike in the area destroyed several vehicles Monday. Spokespersons for the White House's National Security Council did not immediately respond to MailOnline's questions about the role of Special Forces near Zumar, and about whether President Obama considers Special Operators who travel without U.S. insignia to be 'combat forces.' They had a painful and busy morning: ISIS released a video that shows the beheading of U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff, and said the murder was retaliation for continued airstrikes in Iraq. Sotloff is the second American journalist to be killed by ISIS, and his death comes two weeks after James Foley was executed in a similar video. The Iraqi military retook control of the northern town of Amerli on Sunday, aided by Peshmerga who say they're receiving help from Americans with boots on the ground . In . the video, titled 'A Second Message to America,' Sotloff appears in a . orange jumpsuit before he is beheaded by an ISIS militant. The . executioner appears to be the same man who killed Foley – known as . 'Jihadi John' – and tells the camera: ""I’m back, Obama, and I’m back . because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State"".' Sotloff, 31, freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines and vanished in Syria in August 2013. A retired Special Forces soldier told MailOnline on Tuesday that most of the 100-plus airstrikes the Pentagon has confirmed would have required 'some kind of boots on the ground' to deliver real-time intelligence on airstrike targets – such as who is traveling in a convoy or which ISIS leaders are in a building. They're also useful for 'painting targets,' he said, referring to a technique involving a laser, held by a nearby Special Operator and pointed at a target. Some missile guidance systems can detect laser light and use it for precision guidance. And, the source added, 'if keyhole sat[ellite] images don't confirm a 'kill,' it helps to have ground forces who can find out for sure who we've just taken out.' U.S. and German special ops teams, the Daily Beast reported, 'had taken up positions in Zumar that allowed them to coordinate with U.S. aircraft.'","President Obama said a week ago that no US 'combat troops' would be fighting in Iraq .
But Special Forces that looked like Americans were witnessed entering a combat zone near the Iraqi town of Zumar .

"On Thursday morning I woke to find myself featured in a mini-media firestorm. Why? Because I had shaken the hand of a woman I had just interviewed. But this wasn't any woman – it was Kaci Hickox, 33, the nurse who is challenging her 21-day quarantine after returning from treating Ebola victims in Sierra Leone. Stories were written of our encounter with headlines such as: 'Nurse breaks quarantine, shakes reporter's hand'. It was newsworthy because she should not have contact with the public. I was one of a handful of reporters outside her home in Fort Kent, Maine, when she decided to come outside and talk about her 'appalling' confinement. Under Maine's official health guidelines she is not supposed to be in public until the three-week period is over. That is not until November 10. The guidelines are not mandatory but are voluntary. After she made it clear that she doesn't intend to stick to the rules - which are more stringent than those imposed by the CDC - Maine officials are preparing to secure a court order to force her to stay away from the public. Scroll down for video . Spur of the moment: Martin Gould prepares to shake hands with Kaci Hickox outside her Fort Kent, Maine home on Wednesday night after she held an impromptu press conference . Touch: Hickox and Gould come into contact briefly as her boyfriend Ted Wilbur looks on. She thanked Gould . On the spot: Gould takes notes as Hickox protests her treatment which she has branded as 'appalling' Defiant Hickox is living with her boyfriend, Ted Wilbur - who has been out and about talking to friends. And on Thursday she went for a bike ride followed by a gaggle of reporters and cameramen. Despite a state trooper being stationed outside the house, no one tried to prevent people from getting close to her. Wednesday night's impromptu press conference was the first time I had been face-to-face with Hickox. Towards the end she bemoaned the fact that despite showing no symptoms of infection, she shouldn't hug or even shake her hand of people she meets. On the spur of the moment, I simply said: 'I'll shake your hand,' and I did. It felt like a common courtesy to someone I had just been asking questions of. It was a brief handshake, nothing memorable, something I have done thousands of times before. She had a firm grip. She looked me briefly in the eye and thanked me. I turned to leave her property as she and Wilbur went back inside. One local Maine journalist told me he had thought about doing the same but I got there first. Medical experts say the chances of Hickox falling ill from Ebola are now extremely remote and the risk of transmitting the virus while she is healthy are so slight as to be virtually non-existent – particularly to someone like me who touched her hand so briefly. Defiant: Hickox and Wilbur took an hour-long bike ride this morning - followed by state police in car behind . 'Hiding under the covers': Obama shook hands on Wednesday with healthcare workers who had recently returned from Ebola hot zones and were still in the 21-day risk period. He attacked critics who were imposing strict quarantine rules on those the president described as 'American heroes' President Obama on Wednesday tried to reassure the public that it is safe to touch healthcare workers returning from Ebola 'hot zones' when he did the same and shook the hands of doctors and nurses in the 21-day risk period at the White House. The one question I have been asked repeatedly since is: 'Did I wash my hands afterwards?'. Yes I did - partly because I was going out to dinner and I would have washed them anyway.","Martin Gould shook hands with nurse on spur of the moment after she stepped out of her Fort Kent, Maine, home to insist she was not contagious .

"Anjem Choudary will not face police action despite saying he would like to see David Cameron and Barack Obama killed . A controversial Muslim cleric will not face action despite telling his followers to claim benefits and saying David Cameron should be killed. Telling fellow fanatics to claim 'jihad seeker's allowance', Anjem Choudary, who in the past has planned to disrupt the minute's silence on Remembrance Sunday, also openly mocked hard-working Britons, calling them 'slaves'. The Sun newspaper secretly filmed him saying Islam will overrun Europe, David Cameron and Barack Obama should be killed, and called the Queen 'ugly'. The newspaper gave its evidence to the authorities, but Thames Valley Police today said: 'The material fell below an evidential threshold to pursue a criminal case against him.' After the incident, Choudary said he had been 'joking' and his words had been misconstrued. He also maintained that Osama Bin Laden was his 'hero'. The father-of-four takes home more than £25,000 a year in benefits and lives in a £320,000 house in Leytonstone, East London. He told a crowd of around 30 fanatics: 'People will say, ""Ah, but you are not working"". But the normal situation is for you to take money from the kuffar (non-Muslim). 'So we take jihad seeker's allowance. You need to get support.' In another video a grinning Choudary is recorded telling his disciples that it is justifiable to take money from non-believers. He said: 'The normal situation is to take money from the kuffar. You work, give us the money, Allahu Akhbar (God is great). Hopefully there's no one from the DSS listening to this.' The newspaper gave its evidence to the authorities, but Thames Valley Police today said: 'The material fell below an evidential threshold to pursue a criminal case against him' In one section of the video Choudary said Barack Obama (left) and David Cameron (right) should be killed . He . also called Mr Cameron, Mr Obama and the leaders of Pakistan and Egypt . the 'shaitan', or devil, and said he wanted them to be killed. Choudary . spoke glowingly of the 9/11 attacks and urged his followers to have . 'hate' in their hearts for core British concepts like democracy, freedom . and freedom of religion. The 45-year-old former lawyer added: 'We are going to take England — the Muslims are coming. Brussels is 30 per cent, 40 per cent Muslim and Amsterdam. Bradford is 17 per cent Muslim. 'These people are like a tsunami going across Europe. And over here we're just relaxing, taking over Bradford brother. The reality is changing.' On Monday, MailOnline reported that a . mother was arrested for posting a comment on her Facebook page saying . she would 'like to egg' David Cameron. They spent four weeks trying to track her down, visited her old house and called an out-of-date mobile phone. After all their inquiries, Kent police decided there was no threat. Last year, a man had his conviction overturned after he joked about blowing up Robin Hood airport. He  was told to pay £1,000 in fines . and charges after being convicted in 2010 but a judge ruled that a joke . could not by definition be menacing. He was at the airport in January 2010 . when it was closed by snow. He tweeted: 'Robin Hood Airport is closed. You've got a week and a bit to get your s*** together otherwise I am . blowing the airport sky high!!' At another meeting he displayed a £10 note of the Queen and described the portrait as 'ugly'. Choudary, 45, ran a group called al-Muhajiroun which held anti-Western demonstrations and is the former leader of Islam4UK. Both were outlawed in 2010 under the Terrorism Act. He told the Sun that his reference to 'jihad seeker's allowance' was a joke and claims he has never urged his followers to kill anyone. He said: 'Cameron is doing satanic actions but I am not asking for anyone to be killed. We want everyone to worship Islam. 'I invite Cameron and the Queen to worship Islam.That would be an ideal situation.' His teachings were met with ridicule by some Muslims. Twitter user Razwan Faraz said: 'Islam teaches us to be independent and self sufficient. 'You clearly are a living dichotomy of ideas and actions!' Choudary later said that his rant had been 'misconstrued' and said his jihad seeker's allowance' comment had been a mere joke. He also maintained that he had been comparing economic and welfare systems between Islam and Britain in a talk, and discussing how Islam would provide 'basic needs' for its citizens, The Sun reported. He said: 'As a joke in this talk to lighten the atmosphere I said ""jihad seeker's allowance"".' He then said he believed terrorist and 9/11 mastermind Osama Bin Laden was a 'hero' to him and some of the Muslim world. Choudary said: 'He sacrificed his life and wealth for what he believes. 'He stood up against the super powers of his time.'","Muslim cleric made his comments to a crowd of around 30 fanatics .

Ford became famous globally after admitting in November that . he had smoked crack while in a 'drunken stupor.' He entered a . rehabilitation facility in May. Throughout the ensuing scandal, which became fodder for late-night TV hosts, he said he would stand for re-election and has . campaigned energetically. Ford did not show up at City Hall Wednesday. but he appeared to be in good spirits during a debate on Tuesday night. Dennis Morris, Ford's lawyer and a family friend, said he spoke to the mayor the other day and he didn't mention any abdominal pain. During a press conference Wednesday night, Dr Reuben Devlin told the assembled reporters that at this time it remains unknown whether the growth in Ford's abdomen is benign or malignant. 'First, we have to decide what the tumor is and then we can decide on the treatment that is required,' he was quoted as saying. Devlin said they need to determine what type of tumor it is by doing a biopsy. He said he could not say how long Ford will be in the hospital. Devlin said the CT scan is ‘very definitive for the tumor’ but a ‘definitive diagnosis’ is still to come. The 45-year-old politician is married with two children. The mayor, who came to power pledging to cut waste at city . hall and keep a lid on taxes, has a core base of suburban . support. An Aug. 28 poll showed Ford gaining ground over . challengers. Ford's recent medical history includes several hospitalizations. Notorious: Ford became famous globally after admitting in November thathe had smoked crack while in a 'drunken stupor' All smiles: Ford completed a stint at a rehab center in July and proclaimed himself as 'healthy as a horse' As recently as July, he was treated for what was described as a toe injury, which will require surgery. In 2012, Ford was hospitalized with a pain in his throat; the year before, he required medical attention due to kidney stones, CBC.ca reported. Prior to his mayoral victory in 2010, then-Councillor Ford underwent emergency surgery to remove a tumor on his appendix, which ultimately had to be cut out as well, along with a part of his colon. Doug Ford Sr., the mayor's farther, died of colon cancer in 2006. After emerging from a rehab center in July, Ford proclaimed himself as 'healthy as a horse.' On Tuesday, a smiling Rob Ford met with former boxing champion Mike Tyson, who endorsed the mayor, calling him the finest leader in Toronto's history. His champion: Former boxer Mike Tyson met with Mayor Ford Tuesday and praised him as Toronoto's finest ever leader . Councilor Doug Ford, the mayor's brother and campaign manager, said Rob is in good spirits. Doug Ford sidestepped questions about the mayoral race, saying he would speak about the campaign on Thursday. Although campaigning has been underway for months, the official deadline for candidates to sign up is Friday. That leaves time for Doug Ford, a city councilor, to step in for his brother, a possibility some have long speculated about. Doug deflected a question about Rob's previous health issues, saying only that he complained of stomach pain while the two had breakfast. ‘He said his stomach was bothering him. He went to the doctor's and the doctor sent him over to Humber,’ Doug Ford said. Olivia Chow, who is running to replace Ford, tweeted that her thoughts and hopes are with Ford and his family for good news in the days ahead. John Tory, considered the front runner in the race, wished Ford a speedy recovery. ‘My thoughts are with Mayor Ford, Renata, their children and the entire Ford family this evening,’ Tory said in a statement.","Ford, 45, was taken to Humber River Hospital for abdominal pain that had lasted for three months and worsened over the past 24 hours .

"When their daughter was born without fingers on her left hand, David and Zania Fraser feared her disability would cast a shadow over her life. And as soon as five-year-old Hayley started school her self-consciousness was apparent – to the extent she would hide her left arm from her new friends. But now her embarrassment has turned to pride after she became the first child in Britain to receive an ultra-cheap prosthetic made on a 3D printer. Unlike conventional prosthetic limbs, the charity E-Nable make hands on 3D printers which intentionally stand out in a bid to make children proud of their differences . Unlike conventional versions, the £50 hands are deliberately bold and colourful to help make disabled children proud of being different. ‘It was all her dreams come true,’ said Mr Fraser, 36. ‘It’s the little things – she can hold her teddy, peel a banana and even paint her nails now. It has made a real difference to her – the philosophy behind the charity is amazing. ‘Children pick their own designs and colours, and they don’t look like you would expect a prosthetic to look. They make the kids feel really special, rather than being something to be embarrassed about.’ Hayley was born with symbrachydactyly – a congenital abnormality which left her with just a stump instead of fingers. Doctors only offered the family an operation to transplant a toe to her hand. ‘We didn’t make a big deal out of it, but if she would stand for a photograph, she would stand with her other hand over it, or behind her back,’ said her father, an Inverness-based electrical contractor. ‘We always said it’s just part of her but there was a stage when she was going to nursery and kids ask questions.’ The family found out about the not-for-profit group E-Nable, which introduced them to University of Wisconsin engineer Frankie Flood. After being put in touch with an expert through the charity, Hayley's parents David and Zania made a plaster cast at home and sent it to the professor. He then printed the parts on a 3D printer and posted the arm back . The Frasers made a plaster cast of Hayley’s arm and sent it to Professor Flood. He printed the parts on a 3D printer and six weeks later a pink and purple bionic arm arrived in the post. The simple device is controlled by the wrist and wiring. E-Nable has made around 40 superhero-style hands since it was formed a year ago. Some have flashing lights, others claws. Melina Brown, a volunteer at the charity, said: ‘When we started it was more about function, but now it is as much about self-esteem. ‘The hands are cool, so the kids go from being the one who maybe has an issue at school, to suddenly having a cool superhero arm that everybody wants.’ The charity was formed by US prop designer Ivan Owen and South African carpenter Richard van As, who lost his fingers in a mechanical saw.","Five-year-old Hayley Fraser was born without any fingers on her left hand .

"A Maine nurse who successfully fought the state's quarantine for health care workers who have treated Ebola patients today claimed the guidelines were driven by an 'abundance of politics'. Speaking on NBC News' 'Meet The Press', Kaci Hickox, who tested negative for the deadly virus earlier this week, condemned New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's policy toward such workers. 'When Christie stated it was an abundance of caution, which is his reasoning for putting health care workers in a sort of quarantine for three weeks, it was really an abundance of politics,' she said. The 33- year-old, who lives in Fort Kent with her boyfriend, Ted Wilbur, added: 'And I think all of the scientific and medical and public health community agrees with me on that statement. Scroll down for video . Fighting for change: Kaci Hickox (pictured), who successfully fought Maine's quarantine for health care workers who have treated Ebola patients,  today said the guidelines were driven by an 'abundance of politics' 'We know a lot about Ebola. We know that it's not transmitted from someone who is asymptomatic, as I am and many other aid workers will be when they return.' However, in a separate interview, Miss Hickox said she will respect the wishes of Fort Kent locals and avoid going into the town until November 10, the end of the disease's 21-day incubation period. Miss Hickox was placed in an isolation tent in New Jersey a week ago after returning from treating critically-ill Ebola victims in Sierra Leone, West Africa. She was eventually allowed to leave for Maine, where she was placed under what authorities called a 'voluntary quarantine' for three weeks. But in subsequent days, Miss Hickox went against the guidelines by going cycling with Mr Wilbur and having a pepperoni and mushroom pizza delivered to their home. Her defiance of the quarantine drove the Governor of Maine, Paul LePage, to threaten to arrest the nurse, telling members of the press: 'I don't want her within three feet of anyone.' In isolation: Miss Hickox was placed in an isolation tent (pictured) in New Jersey after returning from treating critically-ill Ebola victims in Sierra Leone, West Africa, a week ago. She was finally allowed to leave for Maine . Governor: Speaking on NBC News' 'Meet The Press', the 33-year-old, who tested negative for Ebola earlier this week, condemned New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's (pictured) policy toward returning health workers . Last Thursday, Miss Hickox was ordered by Charles LaVerdiere, chief judge of Maine District Court, to remain at least three feet from anyone, avoid public places and stay in Fort Kent for 24 hours. The legal action was dubbed the nation's biggest test case yet in the struggle to balance public health and fear of Ebola against personal freedom. But one day later, Judge LaVerdiere lifted the restrictions, ruling that Miss Hickox can venture wherever she pleases because she has no symptoms of Ebola and is therefore not contagious. However, she must undergo daily monitoring of her health, notify health authorities if she travels and inform officials if she develops any symptoms, including vomiting, a rash and bleeding from the eyes. Defiance: After returning to Maine, Miss Hickox was placed under what authorities called a 'voluntary quarantine' for 21 days, the disease's incubation period. But in subsequent days, she went against the guidelines by going cycling with her boyfriend, Ted Wilbur, and having a  pizza delivered to their home . Going against the rules: Miss Hickox is pictured on the bike ride (left) and donning her nurse's uniform (right) Since her return to America last week, Miss Hickox, has maintained the quarantine violates her human rights, claiming she poses no risk to the public. After arriving home from the one-hour bike ride last Thursday, she said: 'There is no court action against me. There is nothing to stop me from going for a bike ride in my home town.' The strict quarantines for returning health care workers, implemented by states like Maine as well as the U.S. Army, are going above and beyond the CDC guidelines. Mr Christie has defended his decision to impose a mandatory three-week quarantine in New Jersey, saying that counting on a voluntary system may or may not work and that protecting health and safety is the government's job. Free to go as she pleases: Miss Hickox (pictured with Mr Wilbur) said: 'We know a lot about Ebola. We know that it's not transmitted from someone who is asymptomatic, as I am and many other aid workers will be' Joyful: The nurse said she had no option but to challenge how medical professionals were being treated . However, in her later interview, Miss Hickox today said she had no option but to challenge how medical professionals were being treated. She told the Maine Sunday Telegram she was fighting for the rights of other U.S. medical workers who are trying to bring the deadly outbreak under control in West Africa. 'I hope in six months aid workers returning back can be unnoticed,' she told the newspaper. 'They won't be in the media like I was, I hope. 'And they can walk into a grocery store and maybe no one even knows they were working in a country with Ebola, but one day I hope everyone can know and still smile at them in the grocery store. I know that won't happen today.' Home: Last Thursday, Miss Hickox was ordered by Judge Charles LaVerdiere,  of Maine District Court, to remain at least three feet from anyone and stay in Fort Kent. Above, Mr Wilbur at the couple's house . Keeping watch: Reporters and photographers are seen watching Miss Hickox's property on Friday morning . Threat: Miss Hickox's defiance of her quarantine drove the Governor of Maine, Paul LePage (pictured), to threaten to arrest the nurse, telling members of the press: 'I don't want her within three feet of anyone' She added that she will refrain from venturing out into her hometown until November 10 out of respect for the area's other 4,000 residents. 'I didn't mean to bring this media storm onto this community, either, but I think unfortunately sometimes, especially when up against governors, you don't always have an option,' she said. Hickox, originally from Rio Vista, Texas, worked in Indonesia, Burma, the Darfur region of Sudan and Nigeria, before returning to the U.S. to earn masters' degrees in public health and nursing. She went to Sierra Leone this summer with Doctors Without Borders when the Ebola outbreak erupted. Bike ride: On Friday, Judge LaVerdiere lifted the earlier restrictions, ruling that Miss Hickox can venture wherever she pleases because she has no symptoms of Ebola and is therefore not contagious . Greeting press: Miss Hickox is pictured with Mr Wilbur during the controversial bike ride last Thursday . She told the paper that she didn't count the number of people who died, only the number of survivors: 39 during her time. But she still remembers the victims. On her last night in the country, she treated a little girl who didn't survive. 'I don't remember her exact age. I think she was 10, but to watch a 10-year-old die alone, in a tent and know there wasn't anything you could do, it's hard,' she said. President Barack Obama, the nation's top infectious-disease expert and humanitarian groups have warned that overly restrictive measures could cripple the fight against the disease at its source. Warning: President Barack Obama (pictured), the nation's top infectious-disease expert and humanitarian groups have warned that overly restrictive measures could cripple the fight against the disease at its source . They claim such measures could discourage volunteers like Miss Hickox from going to West Africa, where the outbreak has sickened more than 13,000 people and killed nearly 5,000 of them. 'These kinds of restrictions could dissuade hundreds, if not thousands, of skilled volunteers from helping stop Ebola's spread, which is in the national interest of every one of our countries,' Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Thursday in Brussels. U.S. public concern about Ebola is high, even though only one person in the country is currently being treated for it, a New York doctor, Craig Spencer, who cared for patients in West Africa. Spencer, 33, was in a stable condition - upgraded from serious - on Saturday, New York's Bellevue Hospital said.","Kaci Hickox, 33, criticised strict guidelines for returning health workers .

"Jewish people are being attacked and abused on the streets of Germany as though the country were back in the Nazi era, political and religious leaders warned yesterday. Escalating violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has prompted a disturbing rise in anti-Semitism in Europe in the last few days. Murderous slogans dating back to the days of Hitler have been chanted at pro-Palestinian rallies in Germany. Jewish-owned shops were attacked and burned in riots in France at the weekend. The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, said: ‘They pursue the Jews in the streets of Berlin… as if we were in 1938.’ Scroll down for video . Participants of a pro-Gaza demonstration hold a poster depicting Israeli's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Berlin authorities announced today they've banned pro-Gaza protesters from chanting anti-Semitic slogans . Since the outbreak of violence between Israel and Hamas, participants at anti-Israel demonstrations across Germany have frequently used anti-Semitic slogans and also called for Jews to be gassed . Jewish groups expressed disgust over the tide of hate crimes and warned of ‘a new level of hatred and violence in all of Europe’. Foreign ministers from Germany, France and Italy yesterday issued a joint statement condemning the rise in anti-Semitic protests and violence and vowed to combat hostility against Jewish people. In Germany, there have been reports of protesters chanting ‘Jews to the gas chambers’. Police in Berlin have banned race-hate slogans that reappeared after being originally used in the days of the Nazis. Officers had to protect an Israeli tourist at the weekend after protesters spotted his yarmulke (a small, round cap) and reportedly charged towards him shouting ‘Jew! We’ll get you.’ Fourteen people were arrested in the western city of Essen on suspicion of planning an attack on a synagogue. The imam of a Berlin mosque is under investigation after allegedly calling on Muslims to murder ‘Zionist Jews’. In Paris, hundreds of protesters have attacked synagogues and set fire to shops in the suburb of Sarcelles, nicknamed Little Jerusalem. Posters urged anti-Israel demonstrators to join ‘a raid on the Jewish district’, saying: ‘Come equipped  with hammers, fire extinguishers and batons.’ Rioters face riot police, following a pro-Palestinian demonstration, in Sarcelles, north of Paris, on Sunday . Witnesses said several hundred youths marched on a synagogue chanting ‘Death to Jews’ and were beaten back by riot police using tear gas. The protesters then targeted a shopping centre, a kosher grocery and a Jewish-owned chemist. Police said 19 people were arrested after the violence on Sunday. Eight synagogues in France were said to have been targeted in the last week. In the Netherlands, the home of the Dutch chief rabbi was attacked twice in one week. Dieter Graumann, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said the rise in attacks was a terrifying reminder of an era that was thought to be in the distant past. He said: ‘We are currently experiencing in this country an explosion of evil and violent hatred of Jews, which shocks and dismays all of us. ‘We would never in our lives have thought it possible any more that anti-Semitic views of the nastiest and most primitive kind can be chanted on German streets.’ French youth defying a ban on a protest against Israel's Gaza offensive went on a rampage in a Paris suburb . French prime minister Manuel Valls condemned the violence in Paris as ‘intolerable’ and warned that France faced ‘a new form of anti-Semitism’. Roger Cukierman, of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France, said Jews were living in fear. He said: ‘They are not shouting “Death to the Israelis” on the streets of Paris. They are screaming “Death to the Jews”.’ One long-time resident of Sarcelles, called Laetitia, told the France 24 TV channel: ‘We called our town Little Jerusalem because we felt at home here. We were safe, there were never any problems. And I just wasn’t expecting anything like this. We are very shocked.’ French President Francois Hollande met Jewish and Muslim leaders in the Elysee Palace on Monday and told them that fighting anti-Semitism will be a ‘national cause’. France has around half a million Jews, the biggest population in Europe, and around five million Muslims. The Jewish population of Germany has increased in the past two decades to around 250,000, most of them migrants from the former Soviet Union who came after German reunification. In Gaza yesterday Israel continued to pound targets. A United Nations school sheltering displaced Palestinians was hit by shells. More than 600 Palestinians have been killed in the two-week battle between Israel and Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip. The UN estimates that at least three quarters of the deaths were civilians. Israel says 27 of its soldiers have been killed in the fighting. Hamas has fired hundreds of  rockets into Israel during the current conflict, killing two civilians. Some American and European airlines yesterday halted flights to  Israel after a rocket landed near Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport. Delta, United Airlines, Germany’s Lufthansa and Air France suspended services in a  sign of anxieties about jets flying near  war zones following the Malaysia Airlines  disaster in Ukraine.","Yakov Hadas-Handelsman has expressed fears over attacks on Jews .

"Marks & Spencer has reported a 13th consecutive quarterly fall in general sales - this time blaming a warm September. Britain's biggest clothing retailer by revenue said sales of clothing, footwear and homeware, fell four per cent in the 13 weeks to September 27. Today's results mean that M&S is falling further behind rivals, with Next now more profitable and Primark's sales growth in recent years has soared at rate that M&S would envy. Boss Marc Bolland has been in the firing line because he has struggled to turn around the High Street stalwart since he took over as chief executive from Sir Stuart Rose in 2010. But the 130-year-old group did post an increase in underlying first-half profit for the first time in four years. Scroll down for video . Under pressure: Marc Bolland, pictured with M&S model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, faces more questions today after the 13th consecutive fall in general sales, which is mainly clothes . Defence: Mr Bolland said that they were getting  'increasingly positive feedback' from customers on its women's clothing lines . Across the group, sales rose one per to £4.9 billion in the six months to September 27 and underlying profits lifted 2.3 per cent to £268 million, compared with City expectations for a decline. Mr Bolland said: 'M&S delivered sales growth and increased profit in the first half despite a tough market, particularly in September. We are pleased with the progress we have made against our key priorities for the year.' Online sales on its new website, part of a £150million revamp, were down 4.6 per cent in the second quarter, but this was better than the 8.1 per cent fall in the previous quarter. Food sales have slowed to a 0.2 per cent rise in the quarter compared to 1.7 per cent in the previous quarter. The retailer said up to 200 Simply Food stores are now planned over the next three years, compared with 150 previously guided. M&S said today it was pleased with results despite ongoing struggles . M&S shares ended last week at 406.7p having lost 20 per cent of their value since hitting 511p in February. But they opened 30p higher because of the news this morning. A company spokesman said: 'Womenswear performance continues to improve with growth in full price sales and increasingly positive feedback from our customers. 'However, the recent market conditions remain challenging, with unseasonal weather resulting in high levels of promotional activity across the market. 'Despite some improvement in consumer confidence, market conditions continue to be challenging. As a result, we remain cautious about the outlook for the remainder of the year. However, we are confident that we are well set up for the key Christmas trading period.' There have also been complaints by customers about a drop in quality but no drop in price and its production line has been branded sluggish, making it too slow to react to fashion trends. But Mr Bolland, who joined the company in 2010, highlighted an improving trend in womenswear following 'increasingly positive feedback' from customers, with sales up 1.3 per cent when excluding September. M&S also said that a recent survey found than 69 per cent of customers believed their ranges were on trend and fashionable. Analysts noted the green shoots but said it was too soon to say whether Bolland was finally delivering a turnaround. 'Beyond the flagship stores, many still feel like museums where older people go to browse black slacks,' said Phil Dorrell, director of the retail consultancy Retail Remedy. 'No amount of hand-wringing about September's unseasonal weather can explain away such weak clothing sales across the six-month period. 'But Marc Bolland may have done just enough to avoid the rocks - for now'. Flop? Leading ladies show off the M&S collection, but clothing and general merchandise sales are down yet again . Rival Next, which has consistently outperformed M&S in recent years, was last week forced to warn that profits for the year will be £25million lower than expected because of the warm autumn. Next has overtaken M&S in terms of profits, raking in £695million last year to its more established rival's £623million. But Primark shrugged off the warm winter weather blighting many of its rivals by managing to grow sales during the past four weeks. Julie Palmer, Partner at Begbies Traynor said: 'Whilst the unusually warm Autumn months has afflicted many clothing retailers, Marks and Spencer’s 1.6 per cent fall in sales demonstrates it has continued to lose market share. 'With Christmas just around the corner, analysts will be watching Marks and Spencer’s food sales extremely closely as success here will surely buy Bolland more time for his strategy to bear fruit. But the biggest test will be whether the new clothing ranges can help M&S regain some of its recent market share losses.' Neil Saunders, managing director of retail consultancy Conlumino, said there were some glimmers of hope from the retailer, particularly on signs that its strategy of becoming more fashion-focused is starting to pay off. He added: 'Overall, M&S's school report for this term reads 'showing signs of improvement', but there is quite some way to go before it is back at the top of the class.' The latest M&S clothing ranges have been well received by the fashion press but problems with the supply chain have held it back. Shoppers have complained that stores run out of popular items while its website has suffered teething problems since its relaunch in February. Bolland recently insisted that M&S is now 'fit for the future' having spent more than £2.3billion on his turnaround strategy. But Kate Calvert, an analyst at Investec, said: 'We don't expect much hard evidence to support a recovery thesis yet.' In fashion: Primark has been described by analysts as a 'retailing powerhouse' that's perfected the art of mixing low prices with high fashion . M&S is being beaten by 'retailing powerhouse' Primark, which has  perfected the art of mixing low prices with high fashion. Experts say it has won more customers every year by improving improving perceptions of its quality while keeping its prices low. It also concentrates on its stores, using its website to promote new items but does not have an online shopping feature. Stephen Springham, senior retail analyst at Planet Retail, said Primark succeeds by being 'not just cheap but also by being very fashionable'. He said: 'The fact that the product may lack durability is neither here nor there - its shoppers are after something fast and disposable. 'The Primark model relies on stores having mass destination appeal and shoppers not knowing what they are going to buy before they go in. 'But they will never, ever leave empty-handed. And they will be back again very soon to do the same again. Customers enjoying shopping, retail as a leisure pursuit - old guard, but highly effective nonetheless.' The high street giant has also considerably upped its fashion game in recent years, with stronger, on-trend ranges, which sees customers sharing pictures and videos of their shopping sprees at value retailers, analysts Conlumino said.","M&S general sales, mainly clothes, down 4% for the latest quarter .

"Four California men arrested for plotting to join al-Qaeda and fight alongside the Taliban prepared for their violent jihad against Americans by training at a local paintball range, the FBI has revealed. FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said the defendants are under arrest for plotting to bomb government facilities and public places. According to the federal complaint . unsealed on Monday during initial appearances, 34-year-old Sohiel Omar . Kabir introduced two other California men to the radical Islamist . doctrine of Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S.-born radical cleric who was killed . in a drone strike last year. Busted: Arifeen D. Gojali, left, and Ralph de Leon, right, were arrested for their roles in the alleged terror plot . Authorities allege Kabir traveled to Afghanistan and communicated with the two - 23-year-old Ralph Deleon and 21-year-old Miguel Alejandro Santana Vidriales - so he could arrange for their travel to join him and meet with his contacts for terror organizations. They later recruited 21-year-old Arifeen David Gojali. The complaint says Deleon and Santana told an FBI source of their plans to train in Afghanistan, kill U.S. soldiers there and engage in 'violent jihad.' The document also alleges the men . went to a shooting range several times to fire pistols. During a September 10 trip, Deleon told a confidential FBI source that he wanted to be on . the front lines overseas and use C-4 explosives in an attack. Santana agreed. 'I wanna do C-4s if I could put one . of these trucks right here with my, with that. Just drive into, like, . the baddest military base,' Santana said, according to the complaint, . adding that he wanted to use a large quantity of the explosive. Whispers of terror: The four suspects were reportedly influenced by the writings of U.S.-born radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike last year . Faces of terror: Gojali, left, was reportedly recruited later by DeLeon, right, and Miguel Alejandro Santana Vidriales . 'If I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna take out a whole base. Might as well make it, like, big, ya know,' Santana said. At the shooting range that day, both Santana and Deleon said they were excited about the rewards from becoming a shaheed, Arabic for martyr, according to the complaint. In addition to practicing with real weapons, the men also reportedly trained with paintball guns. The FBI says the men went to a paintball range to fire relatively harmless paintball guns at each other as part of their 'combat training.' Authorities allege Kabir traveled to Afghanistan and communicated with Santana and Deleon so he could arrange for their travel to join him and meet with his contacts for terror organizations. It wasn't immediately known if any of the men has an attorney. The FBI didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. If convicted, the defendants each face a maximum penalty of 15 years in federal prison.

"It has laid waste to the tribal chiefdoms of Sierra Leone, leaving hundreds dead, but the Ebola crisis began with just one healer's claims to special powers. The outbreak need never have spread from Guinea, health officials revealed, except for a herbalist in the remote eastern border village of Sokoma. 'She was claiming to have powers to heal Ebola. Cases from Guinea were crossing into Sierra Leone for treatment,' said Mohamed Vandi, the top medical official in the hard-hit district of Kenema. Scroll down for video . Sierra Leonese government burial team members wearing protective clothing stand next to the coffin of Dr Modupeh Cole, Sierra Leone's second senior physician to die of Ebola in Kailahun . 'She got infected and died. During her funeral, women around the other towns got infected.' Ebola has killed more than 1,350 people since it emerged in southern Guinea at the start of the year, spreading first to Liberia and cutting a gruesome and gory swathe through eastern Sierra Leone since May. Experts are now being offered £6.5 million to find ways to save the lives of people struck down by the Ebola virus. The emergency appeal has been launched by the Department for International Development and the Wellcome Trust health research charity. Development Secretary Justine Greening said the money, which is part of an existing fund for research into health in humanitarian crises, will be used to improve knowledge around the spread of the disease. Two medical staff are bringing a weak patient who has been in contact with people infected with Ebola to the admission . The tropical pathogen can turn people into de facto corpses with little higher brain function and negligible motor control days before they die. The virus attacks almost every section of tissue, reducing organs and flesh in the most aggressive infections to a pudding-like mush which leeches or erupts from the body. The virus is highly infectious through exposure to bodily fluids, and its early rapid spread in west Africa was attributed in part to relatives touching victims during traditional funeral rites. The herbalist's mourners fanned out across the rolling hills of the Kissi tribal chiefdoms, starting a chain reaction of infections, deaths, funerals and more infections. A worrying outbreak turned into a major epidemic when the virus finally hit Kenema city on June 17. An ethnically-diverse, Krio-speaking city of 190,000, Kenema already has the highest incidence of Lassa fever - another viral haemorrhagic disease - in the world. But the brutality and cold efficiency of the Ebola virus - described in medical literature as a 'molecular shark' - caught the city's shabby, chaotic hospital off-guard. Chinese doctors wear masks before working at the King Harman Road Hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone . Crumpled photographs of dead nurses cover noticeboards on the flaking walls outside the maternity unit and in the administration block. Twelve nurses have been among 277 people to die since the first case showed up in Kenema hospital. A further ten have been infected with Ebola and survived. 'The nurses who lost their lives and those who got infected would never have gone in knowing that they would get infected,' Vandi, the district medical officer, said. 'We are fighting a battle that is new. Ebola is new here and we are all learning as we go along.' The first case at the hospital was a woman who had partially miscarried, having probably passed the virus to her unborn child. The facility boasts the only Lassa fever isolation unit in the world, set apart from the main building, and a makeshift Ebola unit was quickly set up there. It was then that the nurses began dying. As head sister of the Lassa fever ward for more than 25 years, Mbalu Fonnie was credited with attending to more haemorrhagic fever patients than anyone in the world. She had survived Lassa fever herself, but was no match for the Ebola virus when it got into her bloodstream from a patient in July. She was dead within days, along with fellow nurses Alex Moigboi and Iye Gborie, and ambulance driver Sahr Niokor. The deaths prompted a strike of 100 nurses, who complained of poor management of the Ebola centre. 'Wherever the Ebola virus strikes for the first time, there is a heavy toll on healthcare workers because they don't have experience with it,' Vandi said. 'The Ebola virus is deadly and unforgiving. The slightest mistake you make, you will get infected.' Development Secretary Justine Greening, pictured, said the money will be used to improve knowledge around the spread of Ebola . Experts are being offered £6.5 million to find ways to save the lives of people struck down by the Ebola virus.

'This will help us better equip those working on the ground so they can tackle the outbreak as effectively as possible and prevent more people contracting this terrible disease. 'This work, supported by the UK, should also draw lessons for the global community on how to deal with future outbreaks of Ebola and other infectious diseases.' Expert teams are being asked to submit their proposals, providing strong evidence and analysis of the disease including how it is diagnosed and treated, by September 8. Wellcome Trust director Dr Jeremy Farrar said fast and effective research is required in this emergency situation and could be of use in the future. 'The gravity of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa demands an urgent response, and we believe rapid research into humanitarian interventions and therapeutics can have an impact on treatment and containment during the present outbreak. 'What we learn could also change the way we approach future outbreaks, providing us with tested tools and techniques that were not available to public health authorities this time.' Jess Camburn of Enhancing Learning & Research for Humanitarian Assistance which is managing the funding, said: 'The communities that are facing this terrible outbreak have the right to expect the best possible response from the international community. 'Research might not seem like an urgent action, but the courageous health professionals that are working to save lives and control this outbreak are in great need of better evidence.' Umar Khan, a hugely admired doctor and the country's leading Ebola specialist, died after saving more than 100 lives, and at least nine nurses have died since. There are 80 beds in the hospital's Ebola centre, almost double its capacity. Shifts are voluntary, and many nurses have refused to work in the unit, while those who remain are overworked and exhausted. Some staff say they have gone weeks without a day off, and 12-hour shifts are par for the course. Sister Rebecca Lansana was quoted by the Guardian newspaper as saying she was nervous about the high number of staff deaths. 'My family do not want me to come here anymore. They think I will die, they don't want to be around me in case I give them Ebola,' she told the London-based daily. By the time the article came out on August 9, Lansana had already been dead five days, aged just 42. Her husband Emmanuel Karimu, 45, said she was moved from maternity to the Ebola unit after a crash course of just one week. One day after work, she began to feel feverish and feared the worst, checking herself in for tests which came back positive. 'They transferred her to the Ebola ward that day and four days later she died,' Karimu said, accusing the hospital of providing inadequate protective clothing. The hospital said staff training had hugely improved in recent weeks, with the help of global aid agencies and the World Health Organization. The Ebola outbreak has infected 848 people and claimed 365 lives in Sierra Leone since the herbalist began inviting clients across the border with promises of salvation. 'These figures tell us one thing: Ebola is here with us and its impact on us is real,' Maya Kaikai, the government minister for the eastern region, told a news conference in Kenema on Saturday. 'It is a disease that spreads very fast, without regard for academic or economic status, political affiliation, age, ethnic grouping, gender or religion.' Up to three quarters of those contracting Ebola are women, health officials have revealed. The disease is disproportinately infecting women in West Africa because they are often nurses, traders and primary care-givers, the Independent reports. The Washington Post quotes Liberia's minister for gender and development, Julia Duncan-Cassell as saying health workers have found 75 per cent of those with Ebola are women. She said: 'Women are the caregivers — if a kid is sick, they say, ""Go to your mom."" 'The cross-border trade women go to Guinea and Sierra Leone for the weekly markets, [and] they are also the caregivers. Most of the time when there is a death in the family, it’s the woman who prepares the funeral, usually an aunt or older female relative.'","Outbreak need never have spread from Guinea, health officials reveal .

"A 62-year-old woman from Oklahoma survived without food and only rain water for 8 days in her car after a cancerous tumor swelled in her body and caused her to become disoriented. Kay Springer, 62, disappeared in June and was found barely alive in a ditch eight days later. Fox reports that Springer was running errands but became confused and she ended up near the Arkansas River below a highway 62 in Muskogee. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Lost and starving: Kay Springer was stuck in a muddy embankment for eight days with no food and just rainwater . Survivor: Kay Springer used shopping bags to collect rainwater to drink . Her car became stuck in the mud and she was trapped with no way of climbing up the steep embankment. Springer knew that somehow she needed to get water in order to survive. Luckily, Springer had some shopping bags with her so she hung them from her car and used them to collect rainwater. 'I’d tie them up and hang them on the car doors,' Springer told FOX. Springer didn't think she'd live. Not only was she stuck in the mud with no way of escaping, she was delirious and ill. 'People ask me if I was afraid. Well, I didn’t have the brain capacity to be afraid,' Springer said. Stuck: Kay Springer, 62, had a cancerous tumor which led her to drive her car to this embankment and get lost . In recovery: Kay Springer, 62, had her cancerous tumor removed and is undergoing radiation therapy and is spending time with her four grandchildren . 'The tumor came back and swelled up and just knocked me out,' said Springer. Springer told reporters that she hallucinated and thought she saw rescue workers when there were none, her own children, and movie stars. 'I begged and I pleaded for someone to help me and no one would,”' Springer said. Finally a fisherman spotted her from a river. 'And I thought OK, is this guy real? Is he my miracle?' Springer said. Springer was safely returned to her family and has since had all of her tumour removed. Springer is undergoing radiation therapy and spending time with her four grandchildren. 'I was not going to die down there. I’d have sat there forever.

"An American teenager disgusted with the American way of life has been arrested at Chicago's O'Hare International airport after he allegedly tried to travel to the Middle East to join and fight with ISIS. Federal prosecutors announced on Monday that FBI agents arrested 19-year-old Mohammed Hamzah Khan, of suburban Bolingbrook, on Saturday evening before he boarded a flight to Istanbul, Turkey, via Vienna. They accuse him of attempting to travel overseas to support terrorism which carries a maximum sentence of 15-years and Khan is also charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Scroll down for video . Suspect: These pictures are believed to be that of Mohammed Hamzah Khan - who was arrested on Saturday trying to leave the United States to allegedly join ISIS . Khan is charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization . On Monday, the slight, bearded Khan appeared in a federal court in orange jail clothes, calmly telling the federal magistrate that he understood the allegations. The local CBS affiliate in Chicago identified a Facebook account belonging to a Hamzah Khan as that of the would be ISIS recruit. Later, as marshals were leading him away in handcuffs, he turned to smile at his parents at the back of the room. There are about 12 Americans believed to be fighting in Syria right now, FBI Director James Comey said two weeks ago. There are more than 100 Americans who have either tried to go to Syria and were arrested, or went and came back to the U.S., Comey said, without offering more details. According to prosecutors, Khan was trying to fly to Istanbul by way of Vienna when customs officers stopped him while he was going through security at O'Hare's international terminal. While FBI agents interviewed him there, others executed a search warrant at Khan's home and found documents he wrote expressing support for the Islamic State group. One page in a notebook had a drawing of what appeared to be an armed fighter with an Islamic State group flag and the words 'Come to Jihad' written in Arabic, according to the criminal complaint. The parents of Mohammed Hamzah Khan, a 19-year-old U.S. citizen from Bolingbrook, Ill., leave the Dirksen federal building Monday, Oct. 6, 2014 in Chicago . Turkish troops move towards Atamenk on the Syrian border to fight ISIS troops attempting cross border attacks.  Mohammed Hamzah Khan, 19, was allegedly travelling to Turkey to join ISIS before his arrest on Saturday . Agents also found a handwritten three-page letter from Khan to his parents in which he informs them he was on his way to Syria and the Islamic State, saying he was upset his U.S. taxes were going to kill his 'Muslim brothers and sisters,' the complaint says. 'We are all witness that the western societies are getting more immoral day by day,' the letter says. 'I do not want my kids being exposed to filth like this.' He also invites his parents to join him one day. Khan purchased the Austrian Airlines ticket to Turkey in late September. Among the notes found at his home were drawings with arrows indicating where he might make border crossings into Syria, the complaint states. It says in the note to his parents, Khan warned them in capital letters, 'FIRST and FOREMOST, PLEASE MAKE SURE NOT TO TELL THE AUTHORITIES.' During the FBI interview at the airport, Khan allegedly said he was supposed to reach a contact in Istanbul who would then put him in touch with members of the Islamic State group. Asked by agents what he would do there, Khan allegedly said he would, in the words of the complaint, 'be involved in some type of public service, a police force, humanitarian work or a combat role.' ISIS terror: On Friday, a video was released online which showed the beheading of British volunteer aid worker Alan Henning . Threats: American ISIS hostage Abdul-Rahman Kassig, 26, who was known as Peter Kassig before he converted to Islam in captivity. He is pictured with Jihadi John, who threatens to behead him in a video for the terror group. Following his arrest, agents searched his home and found the hand-written documents in support of ISIS and a notebook. 'We are the lions of war,' wrote Khan according to CBS Chicago. 'My nation, the dawn has emerged.' According to the FBI, Khan has become disgruntled that his taxes are being 'used to kill his Muslim brothers and sisters.' It wasn't clear why authorities chose to stop Khan, whether they had been tipped off that day or had been watching him for days in advance. Neither prosecutors nor Khan's attorney spoke after Monday's hearing. The United States has been bombing Islamic State targets in Iraq since August and in Syria since September, and has been seeking to build a wider coalition to destroy the group. Islamic State has killed thousands and beheaded at least four Westerners while seizing parts of Syria and Iraq. The United States has no specific law preventing individuals from joining such groups, but it has anti-terrorism laws that it has used to prosecute those associated with such groups. If found guilty of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, Khan faces a maximum of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, according to a news release from the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois.","Mohammed Hamzah Khan arrested on Saturday attempting to travel to Middle East .

"When thinking of secretaries, one’s mind could slip to the glamorous women walking around the Madison Avenue offices of Sterling Cooper Draper Price. But data shows that the most common occupation for women today is still the same, with around 4million U.S. women working as administrative assistants. The information comes as something of a shock, as better access to higher education has allowed women to enter in a highly competitive job market. Working women: Census data from 1950 and 2010 shows that the number one job for women has been secretary in both cases, though the job is more . CNN Money, citing the most recent census data, says that of the 4million workers who worked as administrative assistants between 2006 and 2010, a full 96 percent were women. The most common job in 1950 was also for the role of secretary. The website notes that generalists – that is, people who have a variety of skills needed in an office environment – are always in high demand. That could help explain why nurses and nursing aides were the fourth and fifth most common jobs, respectively. The data could be surprising to some who still picture secretaries as either naïve typists from Bay Ridge, such as Elisabeth Moss’ character Peggy Olson in ‘Mad Men,’ or curvaceous sex kittens like Christina Hendricks’ Joan Harris. But following the Industrial Revolution, there was the need for extensive paperwork, filing, and scheduling to replace what was once a largely agrarian society. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, administrative assistants have steady work with a median pay of around $34,600 annually, or $16.66 per hour. Mad women: Joan Harris and Peggy Olson from AMC's 'Mad Men' both started as secretaries and endured harassment from their male co-workers . The BLS predicts that between 2010 and 2020, the date of the next national census, the field will grow 12 percent. 2010 Median pay: $34,660 annually/$16.66 per hour . Entry-level education: High school diploma or equivalent . Number of secretaries in 2010: 4,010,200 . Job outlook in next ten years: 12% . Employment change between 2010-2020: 492,000 . Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics . The information is contrasted by the best jobs for women, which, according to Forbes, are diagnosing doctors, other health professionals, medical scientists, and lawyers. The role of secretary was one that, until the 1880s, was predominately filled by men, according to the International Association of Administrative Professionals. But with the invention of the typewriter, more women entered the workforce, many of them working as typists or filling other clerical positions. By the 1930s, many secretarial positions were filled by women, and by the age of ‘Mad Men,’ most every office had secretaries, typists, and other such workers. A movement in the 1970s turned the tables on the term ‘secretary,’ and fought against some of the ways these workers were treated in the ‘Mad Men’ era. And, as the IAA notes, administrative assistants today do much more than take down correspondence and file paperwork. Many of them also serve as office administrators, managing the workflow of entire offices.","Administrative assistant still top most common job for U.S. women .

"A MILLIONAIRE’S daughter smashed into three houses in her BMW – and then told the shocked  owners: ‘Do you know who my dad is? He’s rich.’ Laura Binch, 19, was drunk on  champagne when she destroyed the fronts of the terrace homes while  driving her luxury convertible. The crash left a safety barrier pole embedded into a sofa where one resident had been watching television. 'Arrogance': Laura Binch, 19, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving at Derby Crown Court, after smashing her BMW Convertible into three house fronts while over the limit . Binch has admitted dangerous driving and . was sent to a young offenders’ institution for six months by a judge . who  condemned her ‘arrogance’. Her home is Hopwell Hall, a ten-bedroom period mansion in Derbyshire, . and she went to a £8,800-a-term private college. She is a keen . horse-rider who was selected for the Junior GB show jumping team in . 2011. Her father, Steve, 50, runs a property company. He made his fortune . after founding a car rental firm and was featured in the 2008 Sunday . Times Rich List, when he was said to be worth £65million. A judge heard his daughter had been drinking champagne at her home in . Ockbrook with two friends last October. She decided to drive to the . Wilmot Arms, the pub owned by her father a mile away. David Outterside, prosecuting, said she downed more champagne there and . became hostile when staff tried to stop serving her. Binch then argued . with other customers in the car park who told her not to drive. ‘She was . rude and in drink,’ said Mr Outterside. Shock: Tenant Sophie Hutchby is pictured standing amidst the wreckage of her living room in the wake of the crash last October . Damage: A court was told Binch 'showed no concern' and 'didn't apologise' after ploughing into the houses on Nottingham Road in Derbyshire last October . Binch’s father, company director Steve Binch, 50, founded Tamworth-based car rental firm Drive Assist in 1992, and was rated among Britain’s wealthiest people on the Sunday Times Rich List in 2008, when he was said to have a personal fortune of £65m.However, the firm went into administration in 2012 with the loss of 259 jobs.Binch had originally been charged with drink-driving as well as dangerous driving. But the drink-driving charge was dropped at an earlier hearing because it was considered the dangerous driving charge was sufficient to cover the nature of the incident.The decision was criticised by the judge, who commented that once a person is convicted of drink-driving, they are automatically liable for a three-year ban for a second identical offence. As her friends begged her to slow down, Binch lost control on a bend, the court heard. Her car demolished the safety barrier and smashed into the homes in  Borrowash village at 1.20am. After narrowly escaping being hit by the barrier pole, Matthew Fleming stepped shaken through the hole left in his home by the BMW. Binch then tried to snatch a phone off him, saying: ‘Do you know who my dad is? He’s rich.’ Mr Outterside said: ‘She showed no remorse at the scene, she showed no concern for the householders and didn’t apologise.’ She was breathalysed and found to have 127 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The legal limit is 80. Binch claimed she had swerved to avoid ‘something that ran into the road’. Judge John Burgess told her: ‘Whether it was the drink talking, there was a high degree of  arrogance. It was a miracle nobody was seriously injured and your  culpability was high.’ Martin Callery, mitigating at Derby Crown Court, said: ‘She has put her parents through the embarrassment and indignity of attending court with her. ‘She bitterly regrets this incident. Whether it was showing off,  arrogance or drunken bravado, perhaps.’ The judge responded: ‘It sounds like all three to me.’ Driving ban: Binch had been drinking champagne with friends at the Wilmot Arms, her father's pub, but became hostile when staff 'stopped the tab', the court heard . Mr Callery added that Binch  had planned to start work at a . talent-spotting company in London. A post on the website of Trent . College in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, which she attended, describes how she . spent much of her free time training with her horse Grangewood in . Glover. On her Twitter feed, Binch has called herself a ‘Daddy’s girl’. The court also banned her from driving for two years and ordered her to pay costs of £500.","Laura Binch smashed through safety barrier and wrecked three house fronts .

"John Travolta tried to give his Grease co-star Jeff Conaway oral sex while he was sleeping, it has been claimed. Travolta allegedly tried to perform the act at Conaway's home in the 1990s, Conaway's former fiancée Vikki Lizzi told the National Enquirer. She said that her partner, who played Kenickie in the 1978 hit movie, was so upset with the incident it ended his long-term friendship with the star. Claims: John Travolta (left) tried to give his Grease co-star Jeff Conaway (right) oral sex while he was sleeping, Conaway's former fiancée has said . She said Conaway, who appeared in Grease on Broadway with Travolta before the pair were cast in the film, made the claim in a suicide note. It was left, she said, after a failed bid to kill himself in 2006. He died last May, aged 60, from complications of pneumonia. She also alleged that Conaway said Travolta, 58, and his wife, Kelly Preston, were locked in a sham marriage. She told Star magazine: 'Jeff told me that John and Kelly’s marriage was an arrangement. Claims: John Travolta (centre right) allegedly tried to perform an oral act on Jeff Conaway (left) as he slept. The pair starred alongside Olivia Newton John and Stockard Channing in the hit film Grease . 'Jeff said that Kelly knows that John is gay, and that’s why she’s OK with it.' The second masseur who accused John Travolta of sexual battery has withdrawn from the suit. The man - named only as John Doe #2 - has parted ways with lawyer Okorie Okorocha but may still pursue his case against the actor having also hired a new attorney, Gloria Allred. Ms. Allred told CNN:  'We believe that the lawsuit should be filed in another court and, therefore, the lawsuit that was on file was dismissed without prejudice. 'We will be conferring with our client regarding what will happen next in this case.' John Doe #1 hired the same lawyer yesterday after being dropped by Mr. Okorocha and subsequently applying to have his case against the 'Pulp Fiction' star dismissed. Travolta's lawyer, Marty Singer, today denied speculation Travolta had paid off accusers, saying: 'Not one penny has been paid nor do we have any intention to pay any money for these ridiculous and false claims.' Another source alleged in Star that Preston signed a contract with Travolta when they were wed, though the source did not know its details. The claims came as another hotel masseur claimed he had a homosexual tryst with John Travolta. Unlike the first two - one of whom withdrew his lawsuit on Tuesday and the first accuser who dropped his case - this latest man to come forward with gay sex claims involving the actor is named. Former massage therapist Luis Gonzalez said he spent an afternoon with the Pulp Fiction star at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Laguna Niguel, California, in 1997. Meanwhile, another unnamed man made claims yesterday that Travolta accosted him - making it the fifth man to make allegations about the star. The man - a gym employee - has accused Travolta of fondling him against his wishes when he worked out at the gym while he was shooting a movie, according to RadarOnline. However no details were reported regarding the time frame or location. Travolta's lawyer Marty Singer has denied the allegations. Last week Fabian Zanzi became the third man to accuse Travolta of accosting him back in 2009 while he was working on the Royal Caribbean cruise ship. Scenic: Former massage therapist Luis Gonzalez said he spent an afternoon with the Pulp Fiction star at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Laguna Niguel . The first masseur - dubbed John Doe#1 - has now called in celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred after dropping the lawsuit earlier this week . Gonzalez made his claims to the National Enquirer magazine in the US, saying of the actor: 'He’s a great kisser. I know because I had sex with him and he loved it.’ He also claimed that the married actor seemed 'very experienced’ at gay sex. 'I can remember it like it happened yesterday,’ he added. The masseur said the rendezvous started minutes after he set up his table in Mr Travolta’s room. The actor reportedly stripped down and said it was too warm for a top sheet. Mr Gonzalez described how Travolta became aroused soon after lying on the table. 'He moved around and started to breathe heavily,' he alleged. 'We got right into the bed that was right there next to the massage table and had a really good time.’ The 49-year-old, who is now living overseas, said he had massaged the actor several times since first meeting him in 1988 without anything sexual happening. 'Travolta may not identify himself as a gay man, but it doesn’t dismiss the fact that he likes sex with men .. and he’s experienced at it,’ he claimed. 'I was in shock for about a week afterward thinking, 'I can’t believe it! I had sex with John Travolta! I was hoping to see him again after that, but I never did,’ he alleged in the Enquirer. The first masseur who claimed last week that he was groped by Mr Travolta during a private massage in Beverly Hills in January was forced to drop his case after it emerged that the actor was 3,000 miles away in New York at the time of the alleged incident. But he hired celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred yesterday and was said to be considering whether or not to refile the lawsuit. A secondmasseur who accused John Travolta of sexual battery at an Atlanta hotel in January has now also withdrawn from thesuit. The unnamedman - named only as John Doe #2 - has parted ways with lawyer Okorie Okorochabut may still pursue his case against the actor having also hired Allred.

"Researchers have revealed a 16-foot, 900-pound ancient species of crocodile that battle with 58 foot long snakes that swam in the same rivers as Titanoboa 60 million years ago in the world’s oldest-known rain forest. The terrifying reptile, which has an unusually blunt snout, had an incredibly strong bite, the researchers say. The claim the discovery sheds new light on the diversity of early rainforests, and how adaptable crocodiles are. The new species of crocodilian, illustrated here being constricted by. Called Anthracosuchus balrogus, after a ferocious fictional creature (the 'Balrog') that appeared in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel 'The Lord of the Rings'. Scientists assigned the species’ name, Anthracosuchus balrogus, in a study appearing online today in the journal Historical Biology. Unearthed from the same layer of rock as Titanoboa in the Cerrejon coal mine of northern Colombia, the species is named for a ferocious fictional creature (the Balrog) that appeared in J.R.R. Tolkien’s novel 'The Lord of the Rings' and dwelled deep in the middle-Earth 'Mines of Moria.' The new species in the dyrosaurids family, lived alongside the 58-foot Titanoboa as portrayed in the Smithsonian Channel documentary on the 'monster snake.' Scientists assigned the species’ name, Anthracosuchus balrogus, in a study appearing online today in the journal Historical Biology. Unearthed from the same layer of rock as Titanoboa in the Cerrejon coal mine of northern Colombia, the species is named for a ferocious fictional creature (the Balrog) that appeared in J.R.R. Tolkien’s novel 'The Lord of the Rings' and dwelled deep in the middle-Earth 'Mines of Moria.' The new species opens a window to the early adaptability and diversity of tropical crocodyliforms, which may help scientists better understand how living crocodiles adapt to changing environments today, said lead author Alex Hastings, a postdoctoral researcher at Martin Luther Universität Halle-Wittenberg and former graduate student at the Florida Museum of Natural History  and UF’s department of geological sciences. 'It quickly became clear that the four fossil specimens were unlike any dyrosaur species ever found,' Hastings said. 'Everyone thinks that crocodiles are living fossils that have remained virtually unchanged for the last 250 million years. 'But what we’re finding in the fossil record tells a very different story.' Jonathan Bloch, co-author and Florida Museum associate curator of vertebrate paleontology, said researchers were stunned when they first saw the new species. 'We couldn’t believe it had such a boxy, short skull and that it was still a dyrosaur,' Bloch said. 'It really busts the mold for these animals. 'It is such a completely different looking beast than we’ve seen for these crocodile-like animals.' The animal is the third new species of ancient crocodilian pulled from Cerrejon, one of the world’s largest open-pit coal mines. Titanoboa cerrejonensis measured 48 feet and weighed as much as a car. The monster relative of the boa constrictor lived in northern Colombia 60 million years ago . Originating in Africa, the dyrosaurids swam across the Atlantic Ocean to South America about 75 million year ago. The family somehow survived the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs and persisted to become a top predator, Hastings said. 'This group offers clues as to how animals survive extinctions and other catastrophes,' Hastings said. 'As we face climates that are warmer today, it is important to understand how animals responded in the past. 'This family of crocodyliforms in Cerrejon adapted and did very well despite incredible obstacles, which could speak to the ability of living crocodiles to adapt and overcome.' The crocodyliforms that lived in the Cerrejon ecosystem during the Paleocene, when temperatures were higher than today, thrived and grew to enormous sizes, Bloch said. Dyrosaurids were commonly ocean-dwellers, but the new species lived in freshwater rivers, ate turtles and fish and would have lived in close proximity to Titanoboa. However, the giant snake would have been a formidable threat to A. balrogus with the tremendous grip of its constricting coils, he said. 'Every once in a while, there was likely an encounter between Anthracosuchus and Titanoboa,”' Bloch said. 'Titanoboa was the largest predator around and would have tried to eat anything it could get its mouth on.'","Terrifying reptile has an unusually blunt snout an incredibly strong bite .

"NASCAR champion Tony Stewart has said he does not need to speak to the family of the 20-year-old driver he killed for closure. At a press conference in Kannapolis, North Carolina on Monday  - his first since he  struck Kevin Ward Jr. on an upstate New York dirt-track last month - Stewart said he has offered to speak to the family. 'I want to be available to them if they want to talk about it,' he said. 'At this point, I don't need to talk to them for closure. I know what happened and I know it was an accident.' When asked if there is anything he would have done differently the night of  August 9, he said he would have skipped the race at Canandaigua Motorsports Park altogether. Scroll down for video . Subdued: Tony Stewart held a press conference at his business in Kannapolis, North Carolina on Monday morning, pictured, to talk about life since the crash that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. last month . A changed man: He said that life will never be the same but that he hopes to return to race driving . 'I'd have stayed at Watkins Glen that night,' he said. 'It wasn't a big-paying race, I just wanted to go run my sprint car for a night. I do it to have fun and it didn't end up being fun that night.' After weeks of being secluded in his home, he now hopes to venture out more and thank the people who have given him support over the past several weeks, he said. 'I don't know if it'll ever be normal again,' he said. 'Before the accident, a day would fly by me. Now a day seems like two-three days. Like the batteries are running low on the clock.' He added that he doesn't know when he will race again, but has not written off returning to the sport. Left without a son: Stewart said he doesn't have to speak to the family of Kevin Ward Jr. for closure. The young racing star, right, is pictured with his parents, Kevin Ward Sr. and Pamela . 'I love what I do,' he said. 'I love driving race cars. I think it might change as far as how much of it and what I would do. That would take a lot to stop.' Ward and Stewart had been racing for position at Canandaigua Motorsports Park in upstate New York on August 9 when Ward crashed - apparently after being struck by Stewart's vehicle. The younger driver climbed out of his car and walked down the dark track in an apparent attempt to confront Stewart. A toxicology report found Ward also had marijuana in his system. Stewart slammed into the young driver as he walked on the track, killing him. Last week, a grand jury concluded they would not indict him in the death. At the press conference, Stewart said he was glad with the outcome. Crash: An image taken from a video of the crash shows Ward being fatally struck by the vehicle . 'I would be lying if I said there wasn't a piece of relief, but that was very short-lived in my heart,' he said. 'It went right back to the fact that we lost Kevin. We lost a young driver that had a lot of talent.' Ward's family has said 'the matter is not at rest,' and Stewart may still face a civil lawsuit.

'You are scared to be around anybody, you are embarrassed to be around anybody because of what happened.' He went on: 'There hasn't been a day that's gone by that I haven't thought about it.

"The spread of the deadly Ebola virus is out of control and the effects could be ‘catastrophic’, the World Health Organisation said last night. The outbreak of the disease, the worst since it was discovered in the mid-1970s, has so far caused 729 deaths in four different countries. At the moment its spread is contained to West Africa, but there are growing fears that it could hit the UK. Last night WHO director-general Margaret Chan said: ‘This outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it. If the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives, severe socioeconomic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries.’ Scroll down for video . Medical workers in Sierra Leone wear protective clothing while treating patients infected with the Ebola virus in Kenema District . A government worker in Liberia mixes disinfectant to spray the streets of Monrovia to try and bring the Ebola virus under control . Dr Margaret Chan arrives at Conakry airport in Guinea for talks with the leaders of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia about the Ebola virus . Speaking at a meeting in Guinea’s capital Conakry, she told the presidents of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast that the virus could be stopped. But she said that cultural practices such as traditional burials were a significant cause of its spread. British authorities are currently on high alert, and have put measures in place to ensure that all passengers displaying symptoms are prevented from boarding flights to the UK. Anyone who appears ill on arrival into Britain will be held at immigration before being quarantined in highly secure isolation units. However, because it takes up to three weeks for symptoms to appear, there are fears some victims will slip through the net. The warning came from the head of the WHO Margaret Chan who said that the epidemic was moving faster than their efforts to control it . Yesterday Dr Chan revealed that the outbreak has now caused 1,323 recorded cases of the disease overall. She warned that governments may need to restrict population movements and public gatherings, and use the police and civil defence forces to guarantee the security of response teams. But the WHO chief went on to point out that more than 60 medical workers have died, a loss which has hampered efforts to tackle the disease. Two Americans working for aid group Samaritan’s Purse who contracted the disease in Liberia are in a serious condition and are being medically evacuated, the organisation said. And the outbreak has prompted some international organisations to withdraw. The US Peace Corps has said it was withdrawing 340 volunteers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Samaritan’s Purse said on Friday it would complete the evacuation of its 60 international staff from Liberia over the weekend and WaterAid said on Friday it was suspending its operations there as well. Sierra Leone yesterday declared a public health emergency with the government ordering house-to-house searches by troops to seek out infected patients. So far Liberia has closed all schools and some government departments as well as looking at the possibility of quarantining affected communities. Soldiers have been deployed to the streets of Liberia to prevent panic as fears spread about the deadly virus . But the leader of Guinea’s Ebola taskforce said his country would not be following these moves. ‘Some measures taken by our neighbours could make the fight against Ebola even harder,’ Aboubacar Sidiki Diakite said, citing in particular the closure of schools. He added: ‘When children are not supervised, they can go anywhere and make the problem worse.’ The WHO will convene an emergency committee on August 6 to decide if the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and to recommend measures to tackle it. Dr Chan has promised to take personal responsibility for coordinating international response efforts and mobilising the support needed to fight the virus. Health officials in the U.S. have warned Americans not to travel to Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea .

"The chairman of a powerful committee in Congress is demanding access 'without delay' to a key witness in the Lois Lerner email saga that has engulfed the IRS, but the Treasury Department insists she can't testify until after the midterm congressional elections. House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, demanded late Wednesday in a letter to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew that he must make Treasury counsel Hannah Stott-Bumsted available before that Nov. 4 political milestone date. Stott-Bumsted was the first Treasury aide to learn that the IRS was unable to locate two years' worth of disgraced official Lois Lerner's emails because of a hard drive crash. Her former private law practice colleague Catherine Duval told her in April, according to reports of closed-door testimony Duval gave the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. That disclosure, Duval reportedly told the committee, led to the White House finding out about the email losses two months before Congress was notified. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO AND TO READ THE LETTER . Former IRS Director of Exempt Organizations Lois Lerner has refused to answer lawmakers' questions about the tea party targeting scandal; she was held in Contempt of Congress this year . House Ways and Means Committee chairman Rep. Dave Camp is trying to force the Treasury Department's hand so he can hear testimony from a Treasury lawyer who was the first official outside the IRS to learn that Lerner'shard drive crash had wiped out two years' worth of emails . Lerner, who took a retirement package late last year and refused to answer questions in two separate congressional hearings, remains at the center of a scandal involving alleged political targeting of conservative nonprofit groups when they sought tax-exempt status. Camp has sought Stott-Bumsted's testimony since mid-September, he wrote, but Teasury has stonewalled him and ignored his requests. 'Treasury officials ignored this committee's phone and email inquiries about Ms. Stott-Bumsted's availability,' Camp wrote to Lew. 'On the morning of October 14, a month from the initial request, the same Treasury officials told staff that Ms. Stott-Bumsted was not available until sometime in November.' Camp added that Treasury insisted interviewing a Treasury Department lawyer would introduce 'Constitutional and practical concerns' – even though Ways and Means has already questioned more than a dozen of them. 'Why the sudden change in protocol?' he asked. His demands include a list of everyone at Treasury who learned about the email problems before Congress was notified.  He also wants to know who told the White House, which White House officials were informed, and when. 'Your office is now refusing to make available until after the election the very person that could unlock that mystery. This is completely unacceptable, especially for an administration that once pledged to be the most open and transparent ever.' Hot seat: Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew's agency wants to hold off providing Hannah Stott-Bumsted for testimony until after the midterm elections, when more bad news could hurt Democrats' already waning hope of gaining seats in Congress . The scandal broke wide open in May 2013 when Lerner, then director of the IRS Exempt Organizations division, answered a planted question during a tax lawyers' conference about how her agency decided which nonprofit groups to scrutinize carefully. Lerner knew what Congress did not: that an internal Inspector General report on the matter would be issued soon, thrusting it into the public spotlight. Republicans howled at the admission that organizations were selected for intrusive questions and long delays based on words like 'patriots' and 'tea party' in their names. Days later, President Barack Obama accepted the resignation of the acting IRS commissioner and promised in a statement from the White House that his administration would 'work with Congress as it performs its oversight role' and work 'hand in hand with Congress to get this thing fixed.' Many of the Lerner emails sought by Congress have been recovered by searching the archives of other IRS employees who sent or received them. But countless more, including any between Lerner and officials at the White House or other agencies, are likely gone for good. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen has testified repeatedly on Capitol Hill that his employees did everything possible to recover data from Lerner's hard drive, including sending it to forensic experts at the FBI. Ultimately, he has said, no data was recoverable – and the hard drive was destroyed by a recycling contractor. Congressional Republicans including Camp are skeptical since the time period covered by the email losses overlaps with the months when the IRS has already conceded it was targeting right-wing tax-exemption applicants.

"Landon Donovan admitted his international send-off was ‘beyond his wildest dreams’after his 157th and final match for the USA. The American star was given a testimonial to sign off his career after being left out of Jurgen Klinsmann's World Cup squad. But the 32-year-old said he never expected to play for his country again after the snub, and paid credit to US Soccer president Sunil Gulati for making it happen.

'I give all the credit to Sunil for sticking with me through some hard conversations and understanding what was important and making it happen. 'I believe this is a day I deserve.

'But at the end of the day I looked at the big picture and realized what a special day this could be. It's almost like, if you care to believe this stuff, in many ways it's meant to be. I think it's no coincidence it's 10-10 today.'

"The Obama administration announced it is designating a third U.S. military base for emergency housing of children immigrating illegally into the United States without parents or relatives. The news came as officials insist that the children are in good hands, despite allegations of abuse by US authorities. Senior administration officials, who asked not to be identified, told reporters that an Army base at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, will initially hold 600 ‘unaccompanied minors’ and eventually will be able to accommodate up to 1,200. Scroll down for video . Influx: This image obtained by Breitbart Texas shows the sheer number of child immigrants the US Border Patrol has to deal with . Financial strain: Administration officials said they would be asking Congress for an additional $560million to help the Department of Homeland Security cope with the illegal border crossings . Influx: There has been a tidal wave of children fleeing from central America to the States recently . In recent weeks, the Obama administration has opened similar emergency shelters at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, and Naval Base Ventura County in Southern California. The moves come amid a tidal wave of children trying to slip into the United States, largely from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, often to join a parent already here. Reuters previously reported that the administration was seeking about $2billion for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to handle the influx in fiscal 2015, which begins on October 1, more than double the $868million appropriated this year. HHS takes custody of the children shortly after they are detained at the border by federal law enforcement agents. Vigilant: A U.S. Border Patrol vehicle rides along the border fence separating Nogales, Arizona, right, with Nogales, Mexico . On Monday, administration officials said they would be asking Congress for an additional $560million to help the Department of Homeland Security cope with the illegal border crossings. One week ago, the White House director of domestic policy, Cecilia Munoz, attributed the rapid run-up in illegal immigration by unaccompanied minors to growing violence - often drug related or due to domestic abuse - in the three Central American countries. However, there are also concerns about the children being abused on American soil. Documents obtained by BuzzFeed show that a large number of minors have lodged complaints that they've suffered abuse at the hands of US immigration officials. The allegations include officials kicking, punching and verbally abusing minors. There were 809 abuse complaints filed against the Border Patrol between 2009 and 2012, according to the American Immigration Council. Many children crossing the border to America end up being held in Arizona and a top official there says that they are well looked after. Hundreds of kids are temporarily housed in a former warehouse in the border town of Nogales and its mayor, Arturo Garino, toured the massive facility on Monday. He said: ‘The warehouse is very nice comparing to a lot of what I've heard… I'm very comfortable with it.’","Base at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, will initially hold 600 'unaccompanied minors'

"Yale University has held a workshop where students admitted they had been paid for sex, enjoy sado-masochistic games in the bedroom and indulged in sexual activity with an animal, it was revealed today. The workshop, entitled 'Sex: Am I Normal', encouraged students to anonymously ask and answer questions about sex using their mobile phones and see the answers in real time on a screen. Their responses, revealed in article in the Yale Daily News, unveiled that nine per cent of attendees had been paid for sex, three per cent had engaged in bestiality, and more than half had participated in 'consensual pain' during sex. Sexologist Dr Jill McDevitt asked Yale students to anonymously reveal whether they have participated in sexual activities like prostitution, incestual fantasies and bestiality . The session was hosted by sexologist Dr Jill McDevitt, who owns a sex store called Feminique in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 'People don’t think a college student at an Ivy League university would accept payment for sex but I’ve never had asked this question on a college campus and not had ""yes"" answers,' McDevitt said. 'That brings us back to the idea that you can’t have assumptions about people’s backgrounds.' Another topic that several students submitted for discussion was incestuous sexual fantasies, something that initially shocked student Alex Saeedy. He said: 'At first yes, the fact that so many people brought it up surprised me but then I though it might be more of a psychological thing we might all have. 'I think that’s what the point of the workshop was — to bring up things we thought were so taboo and desire or urges we criticise are just regular parts of sexual psychology.' The event was held at prestigious Yale University in Connecticut. Nearly one in 10 respondees said they had been paid for sex . Event director and student Giuliana Berry told Campus Reform in an interview that the aim of the workshop was to encourage students to feel understanding and compassion for people who may have indulged in some of the fringe sexual practices raised by the event. 'People do engage in some of these activities that we believe only perverts engage in,' she said. 'What the goal is is to increase compassion for people who may engage in activities that are not what you would personally consider normal. 'It tries to get people to be more . sensitive … to sexual diversity. 'We’re not all heterosexual, . able-bodied folks who have standard missionary sex.' - Event director Giuliana Berry .

'I think that's what the point of the workshop was — to bring up things we thought we so taboo and desire or urges we criticise are just regular parts of sexual psychology' During the workshop, McDevitt told the approximately 40 students that what some people may regard as perverted is not necessarily so. 'It’s sensitivity training,' McDevitt told Campus Reform. 'Don't judge other people, because we all have something we are embarrassed about.' The event was part of Yale’s Sex Weekend, a series of events on sex-related topics held every other year.","The event, held at Yale, polled students anonymously on sexual activity .

"A mother-of-two has been jailed for making two false rape claims against men she was dating after one, who she had met online, failed to show up for a liaison. Emma Saxon, 23, from Sheffield, was jailed for eight months after telling police she had been raped in a BMW car in a supermarket car park. The victim of her slur Martin Blood spent 14 hours in a police cell and suffered the indignity of an intimate medical examination while the police spent 90 hours investigating before finally concluding it was a hoax. Jailed: Emma Saxon made a false claim of rape against Martin Blood, a man she had met online, after he failed to show up for a liaison . Sheffield Crown Court heard Saxon, 23, was given a community penalty in 2007 after a similar false allegation against a former boyfriend. Jailing her Judge Michael Murphy said: 'Rape is such a terrible, diabolical offence that it is always treated very seriously in these courts. It is a dreadful thing for a person to be raped. It is a most serious allegation for one person to make against another. It is truly awful if it is untrue.' Saxon, of Westfield, Sheffield admitted perverting the course of justice by making a false rape allegation. Bev Tait, prosecuting, said a man rang the police saying Saxon had been raped in the car at a Sheffield supermarket ten minutes beforehand by a man called Martin. An incident team swung into action and police traced the car driver within 20 minutes. Officers went to his address but found the car engine cold in the driveway and a dry patch where the car was standing although it had been raining heavily. Despite their suspicions about the allegation police arrested Mr Blood and as well as being kept in a cell for 14 hours and being examined by a doctor his car was thoroughly searched. Saxon was taken to the police station and also examined by a doctor but refused to take part in a video interview. Ms Tait said it took a month for six police officers and a detective inspector to finally ascertain that the allegation was groundless. Mr Blood told police he met Saxon on a dating site and for him it was a purely sexual relationship but she wanted something more and they would often exchange texts and arrange to meet up. Second offence: Sheffield Crown Court heard Saxon, 23, . was given a community penalty in 2007 after a similar false allegation . against a former boyfriend . On July 16, 2010 they exchanged texts about 9pm. He walked his dog an hour later and swapped more texts with her. She wanted to meet him and he said he would but had no intention of doing so. He went to bed and the next thing he knew was when officers arrived at his home. He said in a victim impact statement read in court that he was 'terrified' of the medical examination but went through with it because he was innocent. When he asked for a glass of water in his prison cell an officer gave him a look as of he was 'scum' which he said would haunt him for the rest of his life. He had been forced to take time off work as a school caretaker with stress and it was as if 'his entire life had fallen apart.' Saxon was then arrested. She admitted she had an affair with Mr Blood but on the night in question she was pressurised by other people she was with to report him to the police. In the previous allegation which was made in 2006 her ex-boyfriend was arrested and interviewed by police but Saxon then undertook a video interview before police concluded she was lying. Rebecca Stevens, for Saxon, said she lived in supported council rented accommodation and had suffered with learning difficulties. 'The offence was unsophisticated and it was obvious to the police from the outset that there were suspicions about the allegation,' she said. She was a 'vulnerable young woman' in the company of 'less desirable' people who bullied her into making the allegation and it was not her who initially reported the complaint. Given her lack of co-operation with the police it was hard for her to admit she had lied and her refusal to give a video interview was an acceptance that 'what she was doing was wrong and she no longer wished to pursue the matter.' By June last year she freely admitted the matter. She had difficulty in managing her everyday life and her two sons aged one and three lived with her mother. There was a real likelihood she would lose her home and children if jailed. But Judge Murphy said the false allegation, the 'shame and degradation' suffered by Mr Blood through his false arrest and her previous conviction for a similar offence made jail inevitable. 'It is important that people understand that a false allegation of rape is a wicked thing to do,' he told her.","Emma Saxon, 23, claimed she had been raped in a supermarket car park .

"A Louisiana man who wears a tinfoil helmet to stop signals entering his head was arrested after threatening to torch four high schools. Shane Kersey, 35, was tracked to a friend's house in Lafitte by detectives after he left a message making the threat at four Westbank schools. Sherriff's spokesman Colonel John Fortunato says the phone threats to burn down the schools were received early Wednesday morning. The threats led to lockdowns and the evacuation of one school, reports WWL. Threat: Louisiana man Shane Kersey, wearing his tinfoil hat, threatened to burn down four schools. Police tracked his phone and arrested him . 'Upon reviewing the numerous recordings left on Fisher High and Marrero Academy's phone answering systems, our investigators were able to determine a phone number from where the calls originated,' Fortunato said. 'Shortly thereafter, our investigators called the phone number and in turn were greeted by a subject who identified himself as Shane Kersey. 'When questioned relative to the threatening phone calls at the schools, Kersey admitted making the phone calls to four schools this morning, two in Jefferson Parish and two in Plaquemines Parish.' He told officers he was at friend's home in Gretna, where he was then arrested. Fortunato says Kersey told investigators: 'The foil wrapped around his head secured by a baseball cap was there to prevent microwave signals from entering his head.' Authorities say a search found no threatening devices at the schools. The Marerro Academy in Louisiana, one of four schools Kersey left messages at threatening arson . According to police, Kersey has an extensive criminal record with multiple arrests for possession of narcotics, simple burglary, aggravated battery, criminal trespassing, theft, illegal possession of a weapon and numerous traffic offences. Kersey was charged with two counts of terrorising, along with being a fugitive from Plaquemines Parish on a burglary warrant. A notice on Marrero Academy's website read: 'A threatening call was recorded by our answering machine at 5:56 A.M. The proper authorities were notified, including the fire department and the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office. 'As per our crisis plan, all carpool and bus students were diverted from campus. Out of an abundance of caution the school was locked down, giving the authorities time to complete an assessment. 'After we received clearance, the bus students returned and normal school operations resumed.

"Two chain restaurants have joined the growing list of businesses across the U.S. that will no longer allow firearms in their establishments -- even as states like Georgia and Arizona have passed laws that give gun owners the right to carry firearms in bars and restaurants that serve alcohol. Chili's and Sonic join Chipotle and several other local establishments that will no longer allow guns in their restaurants, despite state laws that allow guns in bars and restaurants. In most states that have passed legislation allowing people to carry firearms in restaurants and bars, the business owners still have the option to set policies prohibiting guns on their property. Sonic: Sonic asks patrons to leave guns in their vehicles if they dine at one of their outdoor patios . 'We recognize that the open carry of firearms creates an uncomfortable . atmosphere and is not permitted under many local liquor laws,' Ashley . Johnson, a spokeswoman for Chili's' parent company, Brinker . International, said in an email to the Huffington Post. 'So, we kindly ask that guests refrain . from openly carrying firearms into our restaurants and we will continue . to follow state and local laws on this issue.' A spokesperson for Sonic told the website that it will follow all laws allowing restaurant patrons to store guns in their vehicles if they choose to dine at one of their restaurants - which are primarily drive-up patios - but they don't want weapons outside of the vehicles. 'We’re asking that customers refrain from bringing guns onto our patios . or into our indoor dining areas,' Patrick Lenow, Sonic's vice . president of public relations, told the website. Johnson suggested that the two chains coordinated to set a common gun policy, saying 'When issues like this happen, we always talk to others in the industry to get their perspective.' No guns: Texas gun advocates demonstrated at a Chili's last month by bringing assault rifles to dinner . Both restaurants, however, said that the recent shooting spree near the University of California at Santa Barbara campus had nothing to do with the timing of their announcements. Last week, video surfaced of members of the gun-advocacy group Open Carry Texas bringing assault rifles to a San Antonio Chili's restaurant. The gun-toting advocates were asked to leave for upsetting other patrons - and the incident prompted Chili's corporate office to review its policy on firearms in its restaurants. Shortly after the video appeared on Youtube, the group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America - which advocates for stricter gun regulations - called on businesses to not allow firearms on their premises or face boycotts. Chipotle was the first of the restaurant chains to re-examine its gun policies and ban guns in its restaurants. Gun-free: Chipotle was the first of the chain restaurants to recently ban firearms in its restaurants . 'We know moms make the majority of spending decisions for our families,' Shannon Watts, the founder of Mom's Demand Action, said. 'When we collectively wield our economic power we can make a . real difference.' CJ Grisham, the president of Open Carry Texas, told HuffPost last week that his group does not agree with the decision but will comply with the restaurant's requests. 'Our comment is . that business owners have a right to make their employees and customers . defenseless to the criminal element,' Grisham said. 'We have always . honored private property rights.

"Through war and peace, in sickness and in health, they have been man and wife for 75 years. So any little tip that Joseph Littlewood, 98, and wife Sally, 99, might care to impart about the secret of a long and happy partnership must surely be worth its weight in gold, pearls, rubies, silver and diamonds. And the advice is? ‘Argue,’ said Mrs Littlewood. ‘Argue lots but always remember to get over it.’ Everlasting love: Joseph and Sally Littlewood on their wedding day in 1939 (left) and now, 81 years after they met (right) It may go against convention, but it seems to have worked for this . couple. They have just celebrated 75 years of marriage – and 81 years as . a couple – and are still arguing as they approach their 100th . birthdays. Believed to be Britain’s longest-married couple, they have long since . stopped counting the number of the times they kissed and made up after a . tiff. ‘People always have arguments,’ says the delightfully no-nonsense Mrs . Littlewood. ‘In 75 years we’re going to have had a lot – but the key is . to move on. It’s never worth stewing over.’ The former mill worker and her husband also shared their thoughts on how . many  of the younger generation appear to rush into commitment. Joseph and Sally Littlewood recently celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary. They met at a dance hall in 1933 but were then separated for six years when Joseph was in Cairo during World War II . ‘Kids these days move in together not really knowing what they want from . each other,’ Mrs Littlewood said. ‘If you’re going to move in with . someone, or marry them, you have to know you love them. Everyone is . getting divorced these days. They have quick marriages and I just think . people do not have what they want.’ Mr Littlewood added: ‘When we were young, people just stuck together – . but back then we had courtship, and that has gone by  the wayside. ‘A quick wedding wasn’t done in those days and a long engagement gave . you time to get to know each other and know if the other person was the . one you wanted.’ The couple met 81 years ago and have enjoyed many happy moments. Pictured, left, on holiday in 1985 and, right, before Joseph left for war in 1939 . George V was on the throne when Joseph and Sally met in 1933 and Adolf . Hitler was rising to power in Germany. King Kong wowed cinema audiences . with the latest advances in special effects, and – crucially for these . sweethearts – the Mars bar was new to the UK. It might have helped this particular courtship that Joseph, then a . 16-year-old financial worker, clearly knew the best way to a girl’s . heart. He asked her for a dance at the local hop, took her on a romantic walk – . and bought her a Mars bar. It turned out to be the shrewdest investment . he ever made. ‘He just charmed me off my feet,’ Mrs Littlewood . recalled. ‘He was from a posh family and we were really poor.

"The surviving Boston Marathon bombing suspect has told investigators that his brother orchestrated the attacks because he 'wanted to defend Islam from attack', it emerged today. In scrawled notes made from his hospital bed, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, told Guantanamo Bay interrogators that Tamerlan, 26, was motivated by the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and his belief that they represented an assault on his faith, according to reports. Dzhokhar told investigators that he and his brother were not linked to any Islamic terrorist groups. Instead, authorities believe Tamerlan 'self-radicalized' by watching online videos of extremist Muslim preachers. According to CNN, Dzhokhar  said his older . brother was the ringleader in the attacks that shook . the nation a week ago, but that the pair were working alone. Scroll down for video . Other plans: New information suggests that Tamerlan, right, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, left, may have been planning to attack New York next . In preliminary interviews with Dzhokhar, . the terror suspect said his brother 'wanted to defend Islam from attack', . a source told CNN. The Washington Post reports that Tamerlan believed he had to defend his faith because he the Unites States had waged war against Islam in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Two U.S. officials said last night the . evidence from the bedside interrogation suggests the terror suspects did . not have any accomplices, despite previous fears they were part of a . 12-man terror 'sleeper cell.' One of the brothers, Tamerlan, 26, died in a police shootout on Friday. The other brother, Dzhokhar, . 19, was formally charged today with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction after being questioned by federal . officials in his hospital room where he is recovering from multiple . injuries. He could face a death sentence, despite the fact Massachusetts has no death penalty, as he is being prosecuted under the federal system. U.S. Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler described the 19-year-old as 'alert, mentally competent and lucid,' during a brief initial court appearance in his Boston hospital room. He communicated mostly by nodding his head but at one point answered 'no,' according to CNN. A probably cause hearing has been scheduled for May 30. Investigators have been quizzing Tsarnaev about whether there were more bombs, explosives or weapons beyond the ones already uncovered by police as well as who came up with the plot. Terror Attack: The two detonations went off near the finish line of the 117th Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013 - returning the specter of terrorism to the United States for the first time since 9/11 . This image, taken from a surveillance camera shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev climbing out of the boat on Friday evening after the climatic police gun battle . Interrogators are questioning the suspect in his room every few hours as doctors sit by his bedside, CNN reported. It was earlier reported that the 1,000 strong FBI investigation team was working furiously to track down the 12-strong terror cell to guard against any further attacks on American soil. On Saturday afternoon, two 19-year-old . men from Kazakhstan thought to be friends of the Boston brothers were . arrested - as it was revealed the pair drove around in a black BMW with . vanity plates that read 'TERROISTA#1.' 'We . have no doubt the brothers were not acting alone. The devices used to . detonate the two bombs were highly sophisticated and not the kind of . thing people learn from Google,' a source earlier told the Daily Mirror newspaper of the UK. 'They . were too advanced. Someone gave the brothers the skills and it is now . our job to find out just who they were. Agents think the sleeper cell . has up to a dozen members and has been waiting several years for their . day to come.' But the Boston Mayor Tom Menino said . the briefings he has been privy to assure him that the suspects in the . Boston Marathon bombing acted alone. Menino . told ABC's 'This Week' that he agreed with the decision to lock down . Boston all day Friday, based on what officials knew at the time. He did admit though that a pipe bomb has been found at another location and that another person has been taken into custody, although at this time he would not elaborate. Wrong plate, wrong time: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's friends liked to cruise around in a car with the 'Terrorista #1' license plate . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is reportedly unable to speak because of a gunshot wound to the throat. But . he is believed to be communicating in writing to a special team of FBI . counter-terrorism agents trained in interrogating 'high-value' detainees . that were sent to his bedside at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical . Center. The two . men who own a BMW with the license plate 'Terrorista #1' and who are . said to be friends with the younger Boston bombing suspect were taken . into custody again on Saturday. This . time the two foreign nationals were arrested over alleged immigration . violations in the Massachusetts town of New Bedford, where police say . the surviving suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, may have once lived. The . students, named by neighbors by their first names Azmat and Diaz, drive . a black BMW 330XI with the personalized plate and a sticker on the back . which reads: 'F*** you, you f****** f****.' They are thought to be from Kazakhstan . and had not been seen since the bombings until Friday night when their . ground floor apartment in New Bedford, MA, was raided by a dozen FBI . agents at gunpoint. One of their girlfriends was also arrested on Friday. All three are in their late teens or early 20s. The three were subsequently released on Friday night before Saturday's arrest of the two men. Their apartment was raided because police say the younger Boston Marathon bombing suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, may have lived at their address. MailOnline has discovered another link - Dzhokhar Tweeted pictures of the car on his Twitter account J_tsar. In one picture the BMW is next to another dark colored sports car with the caption: 'Place your bets' as if they are about to race. Questioning: Two women and one man, both of whom appeared to be college-aged, were apprehended for questioning from the Hidden Brook Apartments on Carriage Drive in New Bedford . Clues: The three were apprehended after the FBI conducted a search warrant on an apartment at the complex . In another a group of boys stand by both vehicles and a youth can be seen making a gesture that looks like a gun towards the camera. The three arrests took place at the Hidden Brook housing complex in New Bedford. A neighbor claimed that the men had said the BMW was stolen or that they claimed they had rented it and were not paying the rental fee. Inside the car was a receipt from a Ralph Lauren store, a pair of Ray Ban sunglasses, a receipt from a shipping company, a prescription, lots of crushed water bottles and a number of parking tickets. The neighbor told MailOnline that Azmat and Diaz were 'nice boys' who were light skinned, thin and short. Tweet: Dzhokar had tweeted pictures of himself with the car on his account under the name J_tsar . She said that they were students at the University of Massachusetts and had been living in the apartment for around a year. She . said: 'They used to have parties until three or four in the morning. There would be drinking and dancing and the police would come. I didn't . mind but they stayed up til late every now and then.' The neighbor said that when the the police raided the apartment there were armed officers on the tennis court out the back on a tennis court lying down with their guns pointed towards the apartment. The FBI later brought a U-Haul truck to the rear of the apartment but did not take anything away. The neighbor said that when the boys were led out she heard 'scuffles' and that they were led away with their hands in zip ties. The neighbor said: 'I've not spoken to them since the bombings. They have thick accents so I find it hard to understand them anyway. Symbol: The BMW is pictured outside the housing complex where the arrests took place on April 20 . ‘They went away for a couple of weeks a few months ago but they did not say where. I don’t know if they went back to Kazakhstan . Two Russian speaking men in their early 20s later arrived at the apartment and told reporters they were journalists from the Boston Globe. They then entered the apartment through an unlocked patio door. When asked what they were doing they said: ‘We are friends of theirs. They are talking, they are talking’ and closed the door. When MailOnline rang the City desk of the Boston Globe, a man said: 'We're very busy right now. Consider us informed.' Complex: The apartment complex where the men live is about 10 minutes from the Dartmouth campus, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, had been a student .

"Whether scented soap, chocolates or just a cheerful bunch of daffodils, the majority of mothers will have woken up to a treat this morning. But last year, mother-of-four Kandy Noad, 35, from Staines, was the lucky recipient of a considerably more expensive gift - a brand new pair of 34DD breasts. 12 months on from the operation, Mrs Noad, who was desperately unhappy with the diminutive 34AA cup she had before, says the boob job has transformed her life. Thrilled: Kandy, pictured with daughter Chloe, 13, and sons Daniel, 7, and Jamie, 4, is more confident . Before, she would hide away her figure in frumpy, oversized clothes and was so miserable about her shape, she barely went out. Now, the mother-of-four says she's more confident than ever, enjoys shopping with her young daughters for clothes and partying with her friends and took 14 bikinis away on her last holiday to Turkey to show them off. 'I’ve never felt better and it has totally changed me,' explains Kandy. 'I feel so much more confident, I’ve lost weight and I feel like a new woman. 'Finally I have the figure I’ve always wanted. Spending Mother’s Day knocked out having a boob job is a bit different to going for a meal or a nice walk, but it’s a gift I am thankful for every day.' According to Mrs Noad, being pregnant and breastfeeding her children Beth, 15, Chloe, 12, Daniel, seven, and Jamie, four, left her with what she describes as 'shrivelled sacks' instead of the pert bust she once had. Improvement: Kandy was unhappy with her shape (left) before having her boob job (right) Happy: Kandy celebrated her newly fabulous figure by taking 14 bikinis on a holiday to Turkey last summer . When a friend who worked with her at the Post Office told her she was going for a consultation for a boob job at Transform Clinic in Fulham in London, Mrs Noad was green with envy and confided in her that she’d always dreamed of having the same operation. 'Looking back I did feel very low,' she remembers. 'I hated my body and was so self conscious that I lived in baggy clothes and polo neck jumpers. 'But I didn’t have the money to do anything about it and it seemed pointless even looking into surgery. 'My friend said to go along to the clinic for a chat and just see what the options were, so last March, not long before Mother’s Day I did.' After trying different implants for size, Mrs Noad called her husband Darren, 38, a sales consultant, and told him how much she wanted the operation. Then they chatted to her parents Gail and Graham and between them raised the £3,500 needed to pay for the implants. On Mother’s Day Kandy was put under general anaesthetic and woke up with her dream figure. 'It was the best day ever,' she remembers. 'Mum and Dad were so lovely to help out with paying for it too. Looking good: Kandy says having the breast implants has made her feel much more confident and happier . 'My mum just said, ""Well you’ve done so well with the kids and now it’s time for you to have something you want"". 'She’d known for a few years, since having my youngest, that it was the one thing that was getting me down more and more. 'And going shopping with my older girls made me feel so self conscious as I’d pick up nice clothes, but having so little up top made them look terrible on me. 'I was a size 14 and always had to wear chicken fillets to make things fit because being that size you’re expected to have boobs!' Now a slim size 10, Mrs Noad loves showing off her new figure in sexy dresses and vest tops and finally feels glamorous and feminine. Thrilled: Kandy's life-changing operation was paid for with help from her parents and her husband Darren, 38 . Excited: This year, she's looking forward to spending the day with her children . 'I was like a tomboy before but now I can wear the booblicious dresses I always used to envy other girls in. 'I . think my boobs look natural, and going to be measured for the first . time for a bra was so exciting, knowing I could wear one without padding . and gel chicken fillets inside. 'I . love buying nice lingerie and now own 30 bikinis - something I'd never . have worn before, and because I have so much more confidence it’s been . great for my relationship with Darren too. 'My . family say it means a lot to see me as I am now, and the girls have . even said the boys at their school call me a Yummy Mummy which is just . hilarious! 'I take pride in how I look now, and I managed to slim down purely because I’m not comfort eating and I love life. 'I have more energy and I want to be out and about. I’ve not changed my diet, all I do as far as exercise is swim, but I’ve lost nearly three stone stone. 'Before, the other mums would ask me to go on nights out and I’d make excuses, but now I’m always out. I’ll wear vests or dresses to show off my cleavage, not because I want attention but because I’m finally able to.' And anyone who criticises her decision to splash out on breast implants will get short shrift from Mrs Noad who says she doesn’t listen to anyone who sees cosmetic surgery as vanity. 'Since I had my first child, everything I have done has been for my kids,' she explains. 'I just wanted to do something for me, to make me feel good and happy. 'If people want to see me as vain, that’s up to them, but anyone who knows me knows how down and insecure I was before and can see the change in me now. 'I can only see that as a positive thing. I can’t thank my family enough for doing this for me for Mother’s Day. 'It was the best gift ever and I know that the change it has made to me has made them very happy too.'","Kandy Noad, 35, says four pregnancies left her with 'shrivelled sacks'

"In the Syrian town of Raqqa, Bashar al-Assad’s hated regime has been replaced by something many regard as being even worse – an al-Qaeda-linked group that is torturing people for writing graffiti and abolishing women’s rights. Raqqa used to be one of the most liberal towns in Syria, but chillingly, the extremist Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is using violence to impose their rule on the locals and stamp out the freedoms rebels fought for. One man showed a TV news channel how he was left with horrific bruises and burns after jihadists beat him and tortured him with an electrical current for spraying graffiti. This punishment for graffiti was also meted out by the Assad authorities ousted by the revolution, leaving many wondering what it's all been for. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Extremists: Two masked ISIS (Islamic state in Iraq and Syria) movement fighters pictured securing a government building in Raqqa in March . Extremists: ISIS are violent ultra-conservative Islamists with links to Al Qaeda . He told CNN: ‘Every 15 minutes, someone poured water on me, electrocuted me, kicked me, then walked out.’ He went on to describe the anguish he suffered listening to others being tortured. He added: ‘When a person is tortured in front of you, you feel responsible. That's the hardest. One guy still inside used to call me Dad as I taught him about democracy.’ Rebels who have voiced their opposition to ISIS have found themselves arrested and thrown in jail without trial. The town’s women, meanwhile, have been ordered by ISIS via posters to ‘cover up their beauty’, according to CNN, and banned from seeing male doctors or even leaving home without a male relative. One female activist drew comparisons between the once-liberal Raqqa and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. Tortured: This man was beaten up and subjected to severe electric shocks for spraying graffiti . Deceptive: Raqqa looks like a normal Syrian town - but its residents live in fear of ISIS . Dangerous: Activists risked their lives filming these scenes in Raqqa . Raqqa lies to the north-east of war-ravaged Syria . She told CNN: ‘They [ISIS] are closing hair salons, women can't go out at certain times. They spat on one girl for disobedience. It's like Afghanistan. Now people call Raqqa Tora Bora.’ The town’s freedom has been eroded to the extent that even filming can get you flogged. CNN obtained footage of the town from activists willing to risk their lives to show the world what is happening. What's more, the group's activities have spread to surrounding areas. Posters warning that thieves will have their hands cut off have appeared in a nearby town. Protests have taken place over the past few months and graffiti has appeared in Raqqa likening ISIS to the Assad regime and telling them to get out. However, such is ISIS's iron grip that no one dares spray it or film it during the daytime. ISIS is not about to be moved on and is strengthening its position by schooling young boys in the town in a radical approach to Islam. ISIS has filled a gap left by weak and divided rebel groups . Reign of terror: This poster warned residents in a town near Raqqa that thieves would have their hands cut off . Protest: Locals have voiced their opposition to ISIS . Indoctrination: Raqqa children wearing ISIS headbands are schooled in ultra-conservative Islam . On Wednesday a car bomb killed at least eight security personnel in a rare attack on a military intelligence headquarters in the southern Syrian city of Suweida, and a separate blast killed eight people in Damascus. The pro-opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said the car bomb in Suweida, hitherto largely spared violence in Syria's civil war, had also wounded dozens. The Observatory's head, Rami Abdelrahman, said a colonel was among security officers killed in the blast at the regional Air Force Intelligence headquarters in the city, populated mostly by minority Druze. A picture released by the official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) on Wednesday shows Syrians carrying an injured man after a bomb explosion allegedly rocked the heart of the Syrian capital Damascus . Clashes erupted after the explosion, he said. A photograph uploaded by activists showed a thick column of smoke rising above the Suweida skyline. The state news agency SANA said the Suweida blast wounded 41 people but made no mention of the target, saying only that a 'terrorist' car bomb had hit a square in the city. State media often use the word terrorist to describe the rebels fighting to topple President Bashar al-Assad in a struggle that has cost well over 100,000 lives since it began in March 2011. A man carrying an injured child after the Damascus bomb explosion. Insurgents have resorted to improvised bombs to strike security and political targets in government-held areas . The government-controlled Suweida region is home to many Druze, who have mostly stayed neutral in the conflict, although some have joined paramilitary forces supporting Assad. Earlier in the day, SANA said an improvised bomb had exploded in Hejaz Square in the crowded heart of Damascus, killing eight people and wounding at least 50. The British-based Observatory, which has a network of activists across Syria, put the toll there at seven dead and at least 20 wounded. It cited conflicting reports from activists as to whether the explosion was caused by a bomb or a mortar shell. Rebels have seized a ring of suburbs outside the capital but the army has blockaded these areas to try to keep central Damascus secure. Insurgents have resorted to improvised bombs to strike security and political targets in government-held areas. Damascus residents reported seeing a mortar bomb land near the army's General Staff headquarters in Umayyad Square, a big road intersection, on Wednesday. They had no word on casualties. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS,is a pro Al Qaida group jihadist group that many fear is taking an iron grip over parts of Syria. The group was formed in April 2013 and grew out of Al Qaeda's affiliate organisation in Iraq. It has since become one of the main jihadist groups fighting government forces in Syria. The final 's' in the acronym Isis stems from the Arabic word 'al-Sham'. This can mean the Levant, Syria or even Damascus but in the context of the global jihad it refers to the Levant. Its precise size is unknown, but it is thought to include thousands of fighters, including many foreign jihadists. Analysts say non-Syrians constitute a majority of Isis's elite fighter corps and are disproportionately represented in its leadership. It took over the city of Raqqa after rebels overran the city in March 2013. It was the first provincial capital to fall under rebel control. It also has a presence in a number of towns close to the Turkish border in the north of the country, and has gained a reputation for brutal rule in the areas that it controls.Inter-rebel tension . The group has been operating independently of other jihadist groups such as the Nusra Front and has had a tense relationship with other rebels in Syria. In July, a commander of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) was reportedly shot dead by Isis fighters in the coastal province of Lattakia. There were also reports of deadly clashes between the two groups in the north-western province of Idlib. Isis also seized the northern town of Azaz from the FSA on 18 September. There has also been friction with other Islamists. In November 2013, ISIS was accused of killing a prominent member of the Syrian Islamist rebel group Ahrar al-Sham. In the most recent sign of continuing tension, ISIS suffered losses in two days of fighting against an alliance of other rebel forces in Aleppo and Idlib provinces.","The 'Islamic State of Iraq and Syria' is torturing locals to impose their rule .

"Scientists have discovered a brand new species of dinosaur with a nose so big it's right there in its name. Rhinorex condrupus, or 'King Nose,' was discovered in Utah back in the 1990s, but scientists never pieced its skull together. The skull was stored and forgotten at Brigham Young University until recently, when researchers from North Carolina State and Brigham Young Museum of Paleontology put it together and realized its something brand new. Scroll down for video . Meet 'Nose King': Scientists have newly classified a species of dinosaur that had one of the largest nose-to-body rations in the history of dinos . The 75 million-year-old herbivore's bones were encased in sandstone in the Upper Cretaceous in the Neslen formation in Utah's Book Cliffs. It's the first dinosaur of the hadrosaur type--duck-billed dinos more often known for their large head ornaments than super schnozes,  ever found in the area. 'We’ve found other hadrosaurs from the same time period but located about 200 miles farther south that are adapted to a different environment,' researcher Terry Gates from North Carolina State University told Live Science. Weighing in at a massive 8,500 pounds and measuring around 30 feet long, the swamp-dwelling beast had one of the biggest body-to-nose ratios of any dinosaur yet discovered. So what was the nose used for? Scientists have no idea. 'The purpose of such a big nose is still a mystery,' Gates said. 'We are already sniffing out answers to these questions.' However, scientists do have a hunch about what brought the beast to its watery end--a giant crocodile. 'It seemed like a great possibility that such an attack could have caused the rapid death of a large dinosaur and helped it to be buried quickly by taking it to the bottom of a river,' Gates said.

"The first legal challenge to the Church of England's ban on same-sex marriage was launched today - months before the first gay wedding can take place. Gay father Barrie Drewitt-Barlow declared: 'I want to go into my church and marry my husband.' He added: 'The only way forward for us now is to make a challenge in the courts against the Church.' The legal move means an early test for David Cameron's promise to the CofE and Roman Catholic bishops that no church would be forced to conduct same-sex weddings against the will of its leaders and its faithful. Barrie (right) Drewitt-Barlow wants to be able to marry his civil-partner Tony (left) in a church . Ministers set down a 'quadruple lock' in the new same sex marriage law - which received Royal Assent last month - which is supposed to protect those churches which oppose gay marriage. However the guarantees will have to be tested in the courts and gay rights groups have been expecting to bring an early challenge. Mr Drewitt-Barlow and his civil partner Tony have been a celebrated couple since 1999, when they became the first gay couple to be named on the birth certificate of a child. They now have five children through surrogate mothers. He said : 'We need to convince the church that it is the right thing for our community for them to recognise us as practising Christians. Tony and Barrie Drewitt-Barlow with their long-distance twins Dallas and Jasper. They now have five children through surrogate mothers . 'I am a Christian - a practising Christian. My children have all been brought up as Christians and are part of the local parish church.' Mr Drewitt-Barlow, 42, who owns a surrogacy company based near the family home in Essex and is opening another in Los Angeles, added: 'If I was a Sikh I could get married at the Gurdwara. Liberal Jews can marry in the Synagogue - just not the Christians. 'It upsets me because I want it so much - a big lavish ceremony, the whole works. He said it was a shame that he and his partner were being forced to take Christians to court to get them to recognise them, but he said the new law did not give them what they have been campaigning for. Mr Drewitt-Barlow, who took out a civil partnership in 2006, added: 'It is like someone giving me a sweetie with the wrapper on and telling me to suck it.' Under the Government's same-sex marriage law, which is expected to lead the first gay wedding next summer, churches must legally opt in before they can conduct same-sex ceremonies. Those that hold objections to gay marriage have been told the quadruple lock will prevent the courts from forcing them to stage gay weddings against the conscience of priests and most congregations.The lock says that no religious organisation could be compelled to marry same-sex couples or to permit this to happen on their premises. Barrie holds his newborn daughter, Saffron, at a hospital in Modesto, California in 1999 . It would be unlawful for ministers to marry same-sex couples unless their organisation's governing body has opted into provisions for doing so. The Equality Act 2010 would be amended to ensure no discrimination claim could be brought against religious organisations for refusing to marry a same-sex couple. The new law also states that it no religious organisation could be compelled to marry same-sex couples or to permit this to happen on their premises. It would be unlawful for ministers to marry same-sex couples unless their organisation's governing body has opted into provisions for doing so. The Equality Act 2010 would be amended to ensure no discrimination claim could be brought against religious organisations for refusing to marry a same-sex couple. The law also states that it is illegal for the Church of England and the Church in Wales to marry same-sex couples. The CofE is also protected by its own internal canon laws, which are part of the law of land, which say marriages must be between a man and a woman. However a succession of past court cases have resulted in defeats for Christians who were in disputes over equality laws, and in particular courts have always found in favour of gays who have challenged Christians. Under the Government's same-sex marriage law, which is expected to lead the first gay wedding next summer, churches must legally opt in before they can conduct same-sex ceremonies . In recent years notable cases have ended in the sacking of a town hall registrar who refused to conduct civil partnership ceremonies, the sack for a Relate counsellor who said he would not give sex advice to gay couples, and defeat for a couple who declined to let a room in their hotel to a gay couple on the grounds that they were unmarried. Colin Hart, of the Coalition for Marriage said: 'The ink's not even dry on the Bill and churches are already facing litigation. We warned Mr Cameron this would happen, we told him he was making promises that he couldn't possibly keep. 'He didn't listen. He didn't care. He's the one who has created this mess. Mr Cameron's chickens are coming home to roost and it will be ordinary people with a religious belief who yet again fall victim to the totalitarian forces of political correctness.' Mr Hart added: 'We now face the real prospect of churches having to choose between stopping conducting weddings, or vicars, and priests defying the law and finding themselves languishing in the dock.'","Barrie Drewitt-Barlow said that he wants to marry partner Tony in a church .

"The leader of a religious group who claims to have the cure for deadly diseases - such as Ebola - will arrive on Australian shores in less than two weeks to promote his 'miracle' concoction, which has poisoned at least 10 people across the country. Genesis II Church of Health Healing's 'Archibishop' Jim Humble is travelling to five different cities through November, including Melbourne and Ngatea in New Zealand, to talk about his 'Miracle Mineral Solution' (MMS). Variations of the solutions are made from bleaching agents - including sodium chlorite, chlorine dioxide and calcium hypochlorite - used to whiten paper and water treatment. The 'Miracle Mineral Solution' was created by Genesis Church of Health Healing's Jim Humble . In the previous five years, 10 Victorians have come forward claiming they had been poisoned by MMS, the Herald Sun reported. The solution - which is listed for sale at three retailers in Australia as 'water purification' products - claims cure malaria, autism, HIV/AIDS and cancer. Australian Medical Association Victoria president Tony Bartone said the group were taking advantage of vulnerable people who were sick and likened MMS to bleach. He said the claims made by the church that it can cure illnesses were 'unproven'. Mr Humble will be promoting the solution in Melbourne in less than two weeks . 'All medical treatments must be safely and independently tested, trialled and proven to work. This product has not been,' Dr Bartone told Daily Mail Australia in an emailed statement. 'Its composition is the same as bleach, and has resulted in a number of poisonings. 'We want to get the message out there that these products are harmful - they are bad for your health. Bleach can erode stomach lining. 'They are expensive and they do more harm than good. The only thing that is proven here is that it is a bleach and can put you in hospital.' The product is made out of bleaches used for water purification and to whiten paper . The church - which has its headquarters in the Dominican Republic - has been contacted by Daily Mail Australia for comment. It published a response to the U.S. Drug and Food Administration's (FDA) 'recycled' warning against the use of MMS earlier this year. The FDA's warning said they had 'received several reports of health injuries from consumers using this product, including severe nausea, vomiting, and life-threatening low blood pressure from dehydration'. Genesis II's video was made in four years ago but was re-posted again in April, saying the response from Jim Humble - the maker of the solution - was 'as relevant today as it was back in 2010'. In the video, Mr Humble denied MMS was harmful to users. 'This product [has been] sold widely in the United States for the last three years and nobody has reported low-blood pressure or dehydration,' he said. 'There's no indication, there’s no proof... that says MMS caused that whatsoever. 'What they're [the FDA] saying is several people have reported a stomach ache and that is the most that has been reported to the FDA.' The three-day seminar with Mr Humble at Clayton Community Centre - in Melbourne's south-east - costs up to $500. But its organiser, Paul Treacy, told News Corp attendees were only asking to make a donation to the church. Mr Treacy has also been contacted by Daily Mail Australia for comment. Dr Dawson MacLeod, from the Victorian Poisons Information Centre, said a total of 10 people - with four needing further treatment at the hospital - had reported feeling ill after administering MMS. Symptoms included vomiting and diarrhoea. He said the most common problem which was causing the symptoms was people not diluting the solution properly and making it too strong because they thought it would be more effective against their illnesses. 'There’s no basis in science for it being effective,' he said. Dr MacLeod added it could spark 'potentially life-threatening illnesses' and warned the long-term effects of the solution were unsubstantiated.","Genesis II Church of Health Healing's Jim Humble created the Miracle Mineral Solution .

"A study suggests the layout of a Qwerty keyboard may play a key part in what parents' name their new baby. The researchers suggest keys on the right hand side are viewed as more positive, while the left is more negative. And they found people tend to favour names with letters from the right side of a keyboard - but only since the rise in popularity of the Qwerty keyboard in 1990. Scroll down for video . A study led by the University of Chicago says keyboard layouts have influenced how people name babies. They say the rise in popularity of the Qwerty keyboard has meant more names are picked from the right hand side (shown), which are said to be more positive as it is the dominant side for most people . The study into the so-called 'Qwerty effect', reported by Popular Science, was led by psychology professor Dr Daniel Casasanto from the University of Chicago. Previous research from the Dr Casasanto said that words typed with the right side of the keyboard were generally viewed as more positive than words on the left side. Scientists believe this is because many people apparently tend to associate ‘good’ with their dominant side - and most people are right-handed. The line dividing the keyboard into the left and right side runs between t-y, g-h and b-n. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the research, though, is that the researchers say baby names have been influenced by the rise of the Qwerty keyboard. Since 1990, which the team defines as the dawn of the 'modern keyboard era', baby names with more right-side keys have apparently been favoured. The trend doesn’t indicate that every name will be left or right-keyboard oriented, but that a general trend can be noticed. The team computed the so-called ‘right side advantage’ (RSA) for every name given to more than 100 babies from 1960 to 2012 according to the US Social Security Administration. This came to a total of 788 unique names. ‘We compared the RSA of names coined before and after the massive popularisation of Qwerty,’ the researchers write. In the research the team computed the so-called ‘right side advantage’ (RSA) for every name given to more than 100 babies from 1960 to 2012 according to the US Social Security Administration. The increase in the number of right-hand-key letters can be seen in this graph from the researchers . However, they note it is difficult to pinpoint the moment the Qwerty keyboard became ubiquitous in American homes, which was where the study focused on. ‘We chose the year 1990 as the beginning of the “Qwerty era” based on a survey of technological landmarks,’ they write, including the rise in popularity of Windows computers and the Apple Macintosh. And the results seem to show that, over time, names such as Timothy and John are preferred to the left-hand dominated counterparts like David and Carl. As most people are right handed, they pick names from the right hand keys of a keyboard according to the study (stock image shown)/ And the researchers say the trend can be spotted in baby names picked from 1960 to 2012, with the year 1990 starting the beginning of the 'Qwerty era'","A study led by the University of Chicago says keyboard layouts have influenced how people name babies .

"Queen Elizabeth I may be one of the most recognisable figures in British history but her style has changed over the centuries. A hidden detail has been discovered underneath one of the most iconic portraits of the Tudor monarch. An X-ray has revealed the queen was originally painted wearing an elaborate wing-like veil, but this once fashionable feature was painted over in the eighteenth century to make her look more modern. Scroll down for video . Beyond the veil: X-rays reveal that Queen Elizabeth I was originally painted wearing an elaborate wing-like veil, but this fashionable feature was painted over in the eighteenth century to make her look more modern. This line shows where the veil was on the original portrait and traces of lace can be seen . This detail and others were discovered when paintings of Tudor monarchs were X-rayed ahead of an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery. The original portrait of Elizabeth I showed her wearing large ‘wings’ around her head, as was fashionable at the time. This was almost completely overpainted in the 18th century when wings were no longer in vogue, to create the ‘prettified’ image we see today. More fashionable: The original portrait of Elizabeth I showed her wearing large ‘wings’ around her head, as was fashionable at the time. This was almost completely overpainted in the eighteenth century to create the ‘prettified’ image we see today (pictured) Getting under her skin: An x-ray (pictured) revealed hidden details that were over-painted. Tree-ring dating has shown that the wooden panel of the portrait was made from a tree that was felled after 1604, just after Elizabeth’s death . Elizabeth I was the daughter of Henry VIII and the last Tudor monarch . She was born in Greenwich on 7 September 1533. Elizabeth I ascended the throne in 1553 and reigned for 45 years. Her reign is considered to be a golden age of English history when arts and science thrived. Elizabeth’s first priority was to re-establish Protestantism but it was not enforced harshly. Under her reign, England expanded its trade overseas and in 1580 Sir Francis Drake became the first Englishman to successfully circumnavigate the earth. The arts flourished in England during this period as Shakespeare, Spenser and Marlowe created poetry and drama. A popular monarch and brilliant orator, Elizabeth easily united England against Spain when Philip II of Spain launched a great fleet of ships, known as the Spanish Armada, to try and overthrow her. The fleet was defeated. She famously said: ‘I know I have the body of a weak, feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king - and of a King of England too.’ Elizabeth insisted she was married to her country and didn't marry or provide an heir. She became known as the virgin queen. She was fashion conscious, with over 3,000 dresses in her collection and died of lead poisoning on 24 March 1603 as a result of the powder she used on her face. Tree-ring dating has shown that the wooden panel of the portrait was made from a tree that was felled after 1604, just after Elizabeth’s death. The gallery's chief curator Dr Tarnya Cooper said: ‘Elizabethan portraits were rarely appreciated as art objects in later centuries, but Elizabeth's reputation as a Protestant champion meant that there was still demand for her image. As a result, artists often reworked original portraits into images that adhered to contemporary notions of beauty.’ While undertaking technical analysis of the Gallery’s portrait of the young Edward VI conservators discovered not another painting but a real animal. Art experts found a beetle trapped where it died when the work of art was varnished hundreds of years ago. This varnish has now been removed as part of the conservation treatment and the portrait can be seen afresh showing details, not easily identifiable previously, such as the boy king’s pale eyes and individual hairs, and the delicate pinks of his collar and flesh tones. Other works going on show include a plaster and wood bust of King Henry VII, which was originally part of a life-size effigy of the king made for his funeral procession, and six portraits of King Henry VIII. Dr Cooper said the show was the result of seven years of work, adding: ‘Visitors will encounter multiple lifetime portraits of each monarch, providing a fascinating and vivid impression of one of the most dynamic dynasties in history.’ The Real Tudors: Kings And Queens Rediscovered opens at the National Portrait Gallery in central London today.

"Technology-savvy criminals could be listening in to the conversations of people visiting voice-controlled websites using Google’s Chrome browser, one computer expert claims. Computer security expert Tal Ater discovered that criminals could potentially use the web browser’s voice recognition abilities to invade users’ privacy. While the Israeli programmer reported the problem to Google last September, he says the search giant has not yet fixed the issue. Scroll down for video . Technology-savvy criminals could be listening in to the conversations of people visiting voice-controlled websites using Google's Chrome browser, one computer expert claims . After reporting the problem to Google . last year, he immediately received a response from the company saying . that their engineers were busy fixing it. Mr Ater said that within two weeks of reporting the problem, a patch for the fix was ready. 'Google’s . engineers, who’ve proven themselves to be just as talented as I . imagined, were able to identify the problem and fix it in less than 2 . weeks from my initial report. 'I was ecstatic – they system works,' he . wrote on a website dedicated to the problem. But to date the solution has . not yet been put in place. Google says it has looked at the problem and found there was 'no immediate threat' 'This feature was designed with security and privacy in mind, . 'We’ve re-investigated and still believe there is no immediate threat, since a user must first enable speech recognition for each site that requests it. 'The feature is in compliance with the current W3C standard, and we continue to work on improvements.' Most websites that use voice recognition also use HTTPS secure servers, which means that Google Chrome does not have to ask permission every time it wants to run sound-sensitive software. While this usually lets web users interact with sites that use voice-recognition more easily, it also means in this instance that there is potential for a cunning criminal to tap into the feature to invade peoples’ privacy, NBC News reported. The programmer warned that as an HTTPS certificate of a secure server is not particularly hard to get hold of, a malicious web developer could programme an invisible pop-up window to let them listen and even record the conversations of users of Google Chrome – even after a specific speech recognition website has been closed down. Most websites that use voice recognition also use HTTPS secure servers, (a server room is pictured) which means that Google Chrome does not have to ask permission every time it wants to run voice-recognition software. This means that cunning criminals could potentially tap into the feature to invade peoples' privacy . While the threat has been identified, no-one is sure how much a hacker could gain from exploiting the flaw and how much they could actually hear, as few people talk to their internet browsers unless they are purposely using a voice-recognition website. However, video chat and online gaming users could be vulnerable to having their conversations listened in to. Experts told NBC that anyone worried about the insecure feature should use an HTTP version of a website that uses voice-recognition, instead of the HTTPS version. They added that they will notice the change as they will be asked permission every time they want to use voice recognition features. Relatively few sites use voice recognition outside the realms of online gaming and chat services, but many people predict that it will soon be used by more people to navigate popular websites.","Tal Ater .

"The manager of the hazardous-materials company hired by City Hall to clean the apartment of New York's first Ebola patient is a former fraudster who was released from prison three years ago, it has emerged. Salvatore Pane, the chief safety officer of Bio-Recovery Corporation - which sterilized the Harlem apartment of Dr Craig Spencer and The Gutter bowling alley in Brooklyn after Spencer was diagnosed with Ebola - has been revealed as a convicted criminal. In 2010, Pane and his two mortgage companies 'engaged in fraudulent, deceptive, and illegal business practices that violated New York’s consumer protection and real property laws', according to a pleading filed by then-state attorney general Andrew Cuomo obtained by Buzzfeed News. A State Supreme Court judge in Manhattan issued a permanent injunction against both companies and Pane was fined as a result. Controversial: Salvatore Pane, the chief safety officer of Bio-Recovery Corporation, outside the apartment building of Dr. Craig Spencer on October 24 . Cleanup: It has been revealed that Pane - widely photographed and interview in the wake of New York's first Ebola case - has a criminal past, but he says that does not affect his current work . Then Pane was sent to jail for nine months from June 2010 to March 2011 for first-degree aggravated unlicensed operation of a vehicle. Pane - who has since changed the spelling of his name to Pain - was widely interviewed and photographed by the press in the wake of New York's first Ebola case. City Hall has confirmed it was only made made aware of Pane's past dealings on Monday. An official said the proper protocol was followed when choosing Bio-Recovery Corporation to handle the clean-up of the apartment and the bowling alley that Spencer had visited. 'We will continue to monitor the situation, provide any assistance our state and city partners request, and take any actions we deem necessary to protect the public interest,' the official told BuzzFeed News Friday . Ebola: Dr. Craig Spencer tested positive for Ebola one week after returning from Guinea, where he had been treating patients with the disease. In that week he visited Brooklyn's The Gutter, which had to be cleaned . After returning to New York City from Guinea, Dr. Craig Spencer was quarantined after showing symptoms consistent with the virus. This is his apartment on West 147th Street . The office of Mayor Bill de Blasio said Bio-Recovery Corporation has no future jobs lined up for the city . A spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio said the company 'has not received any further work from the city as we review this situation'. In an interview with Buzzfeed, Pane said that his past had no connection with his current work and the effectiveness of his company. 'I hope I’ve done what I’ve had to do to rebuild my life,' he said. 'I’m not a bad guy.' Pane does not own Bio-Recovery Corporation, which has been in business about 20 years. The company played an major part during the Anthrax scare in 2001. City documents say Bio-Recovery has been a contractor for city agencies for the last six years, but there is no standing contract, according to Buzzfeed. Bio Recovery Corporation employees carry equipment into 546 West 147th Street October 24, 2014 in New York City .","Salvatore Pane is the chief safety officer of Bio-Recovery Corporation .

"Archie Andrews will die taking a bullet for his gay best friend. The famous freckle-faced comic book icon is meeting his demise in Wednesday's installment of 'Life with Archie' when he intervenes in an assassination attempt on Kevin Keller, Archie Comics' first openly gay character. Andrews' death, which was first announced in April, will mark the conclusion of the series that focuses on grown-up renditions of Andrews and his Riverdale pals. Scroll down for video . The end of Archie: The comic book character Archie Andrews will be killed off in Wednesday's issue, taking a bullet to protect his gay best-friend Kevin Keller . 'The way in which Archie dies is everything that you would expect of Archie,' said Jon Goldwater, Archie Comics publisher and co-CEO. 'He dies heroically. He dies selflessly. He dies in the manner that epitomizes not only the best of Riverdale but the best of all of us. It's what Archie has come to represent over the past almost 75 years.' Keller's character first joined Veronica Lodge, Betty Cooper, Jughead Jones and Reggie Mantle in the Archie Comics spin-off 'Veronica' in 2010. He later appeared in his own solo title. In 'Life with Archie,' Keller is a married military veteran and newly elected senator who's pushing for more gun control in Riverdale after his husband was involved in a shooting. 'We wanted to do something that was impactful that would really resonate with the world and bring home just how important Archie is to everyone,' said Goldwater. 'That's how we came up with the storyline of saving Kevin. He could have saved Betty. He could have saved Veronica. We get that, but metaphorically, by saving Kevin, a new Riverdale is born.' Courageous act: Archie's death will mark the end of the 'Life With Archie' series which focuses on the grown-up versions of the Riverdale characters. However, he will continue to exist in the other Archie comics . End of an era: Archie is just one of many high-profile comic book characters to be killed off in recent years, joining Peter 'Spider-Man' Parker and Steve 'Captain America' Rogers . Who shot Archie? Goldwater isn't spoiling the killer, only teasing it's a stalker who wanted to take Keller down. Archie's final moments will be detailed in 'Life with Archie' No. 36, while issue No. 37 will jump forward a year and focus on the Riverdale gang honoring the legacy of their red-headed pal, who first appeared in comics in 1941 and went on to become a colorful icon of wholesomeness. Other incarnations of Andrews will continue to live on in Archie Comics series. In recent years, deaths of high-profile comic book characters like Peter 'Spider-Man' Parker and Steve 'Captain America' Rogers have made headlines and garnered intense reaction from fans. Goldwater notes that Andrews' passing isn't just a publicity stunt but also a lesson about gun violence and a declaration of diversity in the new age of Archie Comics. 'Archie is not a superhero like all the rest of the comic book characters,' said Goldwater. 'He's human. He's a person. When you wound him, he bleeds. He knows that. If anything, I think his death is more impactful because of that. We hope by showing how something so violent can happen to Archie, that we can — in some way — learn from him.'","Archie Andrews is an American comic book character dating back to 1941 .

"A smart watch has been launched for five-year-olds as toddlers lead the way into a new era of wearable technology. The watch includes an on-board video and stills camera, voice recorder and a connection to a home computer to download images and sound. All are controlled through a 1.4in touchscreen, while the software allows children to edit and manipulate the captured images. Vtech unveiled its £39.99 Kidizoom smartwatch, pictured, at the London Toy Fair. It has a 1.4-inch touchscreen and comes with a built-in 0.3 megapixel camera that takes photos and records videos. The watch also features a voice recorder, motion sensor and is pre-installed with games . The Vtech Kidizoom smartwatch includes a motion sensor, three built-in video games, an alarm clock, timer and stopwatch. It has a 1.4-inch touchscreen and a 0.3 megapixel camera that can be used to take photos and record video. The watch also features a voice recorder and motion sensor. To view and edit photos, or backup data, wearers can wirelessly connect the watch to a home computer. But the technology does not stop there, for the Vtech Kidizoom smartwatch includes a motion sensor, three built-in video games, an alarm clock, timer and stopwatch. Apart from all the bells and whistles the watch, which costs £39.99, also tells the time with users able to choose between a traditional analogue display or simple digital numbers. Major tech companies are putting wearable technology, everything from wrist bands that can track the pulse to socks that measure stride length, at the heart of their new products this year. Samsung has launched its Galaxy Gear watch and Sony has its own smartwatch, while Apple is expected to launch its iWatch in 2014. Separately the Google glass, which is worn like a pair of spectacles, will put the internet in front of people’s eyes and allow them to video and share what they see and do. The smartwatch additionally features a motion sensor, an alarm clock, timer and stopwatch. The Vtech Kidizoom is due to be released later this year, although an exact date has not been announced . However, the launch of the VTech watch means that five-year-olds could join the wearable technology revolution even before their parents. The company has a track record of bringing technology to toddlers. Last year it launched the ‘iPad for babies’, a tablet designed for youngsters aged 12 months and up. The Kidizoom, pictured, is aimed at five to 12-year-olds and has been designed to withstand being dropped . Vtech’s Charlotte Johnson said: ‘We know that firms like Samsung and Sony have already created smart watches for adults, but we want children to be able play their part in the development of this technology. ‘This is about using technology to improve and enhance a simple product like a watch. It will help develop skills that will become important in the future.’ She said the watches are robust enough to cope with being bumped and bashed, while she believes children will be happy to wear them to school. The smartwatch provides new evidence as to how technology is revolutionising traditional toys and playtime. Toy manufacturers are being forced to adapt their products to try and ensure children do not defect to computer games and consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation. Last year, the industry saw a five per cent fall in the number of toys sold, bringing the total down to 363million. The Toy Fair is organised by the British Toy and Hobby Association, which has produced a list of 39 products it believes will be successful this year. Big sales are predicted for the Downton Abbey board game, Flying Fairies dolls, and a new incarnation of the Tamagotchi digital pets. It is also an important year for Lego, which was founded in Denmark in 1932 as a simple building blocks toy but is about to get the full Hollywood treatment. Vtech's Charlotte Johnson said: 'We know that firms like Samsung and Sony have already created smart watches for adults, but we want children to be able to play their part in the development of this technology. It will help develop skills that will become important in the future' A blockbuster movie featuring Lego characters and the voices of stars such as Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Morgan Freeman and Chris Pratt will open in cinemas next month. The company is linking the movie to a new range of toys that it hopes will further boost sales of a brand that continues to grow despite problems for the rest of the market. The family movie has been made by Warner Bros and has been likened to the animations put together by Pixar, such as Toy Story. It represents a huge leap for a brand that has made a success of tying its name to blockbuster movies ranging from Star Wars to  Harry Potter and The Hobbit. The Lego movie follows the story of Emmet, an ordinary rules-following, perfectly average Lego Minifigure, who is mistakenly identified as the most extraordinary person with the key to saving the world. The toy company has launched 13 sets linked to the movie, ranging from the Getaway Glider, at £11.99, to the Evil Lair of Lord Business, played by Ferrell, which comes in at £59.99.","The Vtech Kidizoom smartwatch has a built-in motion sensor and games .
