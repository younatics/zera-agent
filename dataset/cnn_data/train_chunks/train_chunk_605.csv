"By . Paul Harris and Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 10:47 EST, 22 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:28 EST, 22 April 2013 . Rags to riches: Ecotricity boss Dale Vince whose application to strike out a compensation claim by his ex-wife is being heard in the Civil Appeal Court . Back then he was a penniless hippy with no income and no apparent prospect of success. But the winds of change transformed Dale Vince from a nomadic New Age traveller to the multi- millionaire head of one of Britain’s biggest green energy companies. It’s just that they didn’t blow quite  so favourably for his ex-wife, whom  he divorced without being ordered to pay maintenance. So yesterday Kathleen Wyatt faced the 51-year-old wind farm entrepreneur across a courtroom over a claim for £2million she says she is owed – more than 20 years after they parted. Mr Vince was appealing after the  High Court in London refused to dismiss the claim, and ordered him to pay £125,000 legal costs. Yesterday the Civil Appeal Court heard Miss Wyatt alleged she  was treated ‘with contempt’ by  her ex-husband while he drove increasingly expensive cars and moved  into a £3million, 18th-century fort  in Gloucestershire. Meanwhile she had to struggle through financial difficulties to  raise their son and her other children – as Mr Vince’s once-fledgling company developed into Ecotricity, currently  a massive player in the UK’s eco  energy sector. Now judges must decide whether to allow the financial claim, back Mr Vince’s fight to have it dismissed or, as Lord Justice Jackson put it yesterday, declare it ‘so old and stale’ that it should not be allowed to proceed. Miss Wyatt, a former aid worker with a daughter from a previous relationship, met Mr Vince in 1981 and they had a son, Dane, two years later. The court heard Mr Vince took up a ‘nomadic’ existence as a New Age traveller when he and Miss Wyatt, according to Mr Vince, separated in 1984. He disputed Miss Wyatt’s claims that the pair repeatedly rekindled their relationship until the early Nineties. His barrister Martin Pointer QC told the Civil Appeal Court that Mr Vince was not ordered to pay any maintenance as he was broke at the time and living on housing benefit. In 1992, when the couple divorced, Mr Vince ‘had a nascent business but no income at all’, he said. Mr Vince with his £1million electric supercar: His ex-wife Kathleen Wyatt tried and failed to get him to pay her maintenance while he drove 'better and better' cars and moved into a £3million property, her barrister said . Living the high life: Mr Vince, centre, now runs a successful business, while his ex-wife was forced to sleep in a bus garage in order to travel by public transport to the hearing, her barrister claimed at the Civil Appeal Court . In 1996 he had made a ‘full disclosure’ of his financial position to the Child Support Agency, Mr Pointer said. ‘From a modest beginning,  with the . creation of a wind turbine to power a trailer in which he and his new . partner were living, the business developed into a considerable . enterprise.’ Miss Wyatt started a new relationship . in 1993 and had two  more children, although she did not remarry. She . later discovered her ex-husband’s business was flourishing. But Philip Cayford QC, representing . her, said Mr Vince provided only three very old cars and ‘sporadic . pocket money’ for his son and stepdaughter until 2001. The barrister said between 1996 and . 1997 he achieved a ‘nil assessment’ for contributions by the Child . Support Agency despite his ‘apparent wealth’. Grand: The £3million, 18th-century fort occupied by Dale Vince, who faces a £125,000 legal bill . 'Considerable enterprise': Mr Vince in the Nineties set up a wind energy business with a new girlfriend that developed into Ecotricity, now a massive player in the UK's eco energy sector, with over 70,000 customers . He said Miss Wyatt, now 53 and living . in Monmouthshire in south-east Wales, learned Mr Vince’s business was . taking off in the mid-Nineties and claimed that ‘the children had been . pressured by him not to inform her of his newly acquired wealth’. The QC added: ‘Miss Wyatt repeatedly . asked for financial assistance and whether he was going to pay the . children more than just pocket money as he was building up his business. ‘He treated her with contempt. He said . if she could not afford to maintain the children, they could live with . him.’ Mr Cayford said: ‘This is a lady who has had it financially very . difficult. ‘She came to court today by getting up . early to use the bus, and sleeping in the bus station. The contrast . between the two [her and Mr Vince] is extreme.’ The court reserved judgement on the . appeal. If it fails, the maintenance claim is expected to be heard by a . family judge in June.","Dale Vince is appealing against his ex-wife's compensation claim .

Jeffrey Demond Williams was put to death in Texas for the 1999 murder of a police officer last night . A man who murdered a police officer was executed in Texas last night, using his last words to accuse police of 'killing innocent kids'. Jeffrey Demond Williams, 37, received a lethal injection just over an hour after his last-day appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court failed. Asked to make a final statement before his death, Williams spoke quickly and angrily. 'You clown police,' he said, accusing them of 'killing innocent kids, murdering young kids.' 'Y'all are getting away with murder all the time,' he continued. 'When I kill one or pop one, y'all want to kill me.' He finished by saying: 'God has a plan for everything. 'I love everyone that loves me, I ain't got no love for anyone that don't love me.' He briefly picked up his head as the lethal drug took effect, then took several deep breaths and began gently snoring, reports the Associated Press. Williams was pronounced dead at 6:36pm CDT, 26 minutes after the lethal drug was administered. He becomes the sixth prisoner to be put to death in Texas this year. Williams' lawyers had appealed to the nation's highest court to block the punishment after lower courts rejected their arguments that Williams was failed by his previous attorneys. Williams was convicted of fatally shooting 39-year-old Houston officer Troy Blando while Blando was handcuffing him on May 19, 1999. Williams shot Blando with a gun he had tucked under his shirt. Blando was watching a motel where car thefts were suspected when he saw Williams drive up in a Lexus that was reported stolen in a carjacking nine days earlier. Prosecutors say that after shooting Blando, Williams fled the scene but only made it about a block before he was captured. Blando's cuffs were hanging from one of his wrists. 'I have no sympathy for him,' said Ray Hunt, president of the Houston Police Officers Union. 'Continuing to the very end ridiculing the police just shows what kind of thug he is.' Hunt joined dozens of officers and supporters, several on roaring motorcycles, outside the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Huntsville Unit while the execution was carried out inside. In their final pleas for clemency, Williams' attorneys said their client received 'grossly deficient' counsel early on in the appeals process because his previous did not address the poor work by his trial representatives, . Attorneys for the state opposed any delay, contending Williams' arguments were rejected by the courts, including the Supreme Court, in earlier appeals. Williams' fingerprints were found on the Lexus and also on Blando's vehicle, evidence showed. Officer Troy Blando's handcuffs were hanging from Williams's wrist when he was captured by police a block away from the murder scene . When arrested, Williams was carrying the 9mm pistol determined to be the murder weapon. At his trial, his lawyers tried to show Williams was unintelligent, had emotional problems and did not deserve to die. Evidence showed Williams gave investigators five taped confessions the day he was arrested. Williams said he fired in self-defense, feared Blando could have been a carjacker and didn't know Blando was an officer. In another confession, he acknowledged that he knew he was shooting a policeman. Court records show Blando, although in plain clothes, was carrying his badge around his neck. 'Troy was a great investigator,' said Jim Woods, who worked with Blando in the police auto theft division. 'He had a great wealth of knowledge, was very dedicated. He'd take on the hard cases as well as the easy ones. 'He loved to go out and chase car thieves. Unfortunately, that was probably his demise.' Testimony and confessions also linked Williams to four robberies, another shooting and an attempted robbery. Williams became the 498th Texas prisoner put to death since the state resumed carrying out capital punishment in 1982. At least eight others have executions scheduled in the coming months.","Jeffrey Demond Williams, 37, was put to death by lethal injection last night .

A couple from North Carolina has traveled to Hawaii to birth their child under water in the company of dolphins - an idea that experts say is not only whacky, but extremely dangerous. Adam Barrington, 29, and his pregnant wife Heather, 27, told the Charlotte Observer that the dolphin-assisted birth will bring 'peace, comfort and strength' to the mother and her baby during birth. But experts say that dolphins, especially in the wild, are unpredictable, dangerous and not to be trusted around a pregnant woman - or an infant child, for that matter. 'This has to be, hands down, one of the worst natural birthing ideas anyone has ever had,' writes Christie Wilcox in Discover. She . cites research showing that dolphins will 'toss, beat, and kill small . porpoises or baby sharks for no apparent reason other than they enjoy . it, though some have suggested the poor porpoises serve as practice for . killing the infants of rival males.' She also points to a number of YouTube videos showing dolphins roughhousing with humans. 'Is this an animal you want to have at your side when you’re completely vulnerable?' she asks. Scroll down for video . Not advised: Experts say that dolphins are unpredictable, dangerous and not to be trusted around a pregnant woman - or an infant child, for that matter . Moreover, marine biologist Lori Marino has noted that after a decade of research, 'there remains no compelling evidence that [dolphin-assisted therapy] is a legitimate therapy or that it affords any more than fleeting improvements in mood.' The couple is headed to The Sirius Institute in Hawaii, which has the stated purpose of 'dolphinizing' the planet. Heather Barrington says its possible that she won't have the actual birth in the water with a dolphin midwife. But she will spend a lot of time in the water before and after the birth trying to bond with a pod of dolphins, nonetheless. 'It is about reconnecting as humans with the dolphins so we can coexist in this world together and learn from one another,' she told the Charlotte Observer.

The blood had long since dried, and everything connected to that night was 60 miles away in evidence bags or captured on police photographs. The one thing everyone knew about Mount Pleasant Cottage was that this was where April Jones is said to have been taken when her innocent young life was snatched away. Scroll down for video . The court-released photograph of the living room at Mark Bridger's retired cottage, Mount Pleasant, on a hillside near April's home town of Machynlleth . Bathroom tiles: The green arrows denote where police say they found April's blood following Mark Bridger's arrest . Investigation: The prosecution also allege that April's DNA was discovered in the hallway of the cottage . Bathroom: Police says blood was found on the inside of the door of this washing machine . Now 12 ordinary people with an . extraordinary task would see for themselves the place that gave up the . last known trace of the missing five-year-old. In the spectacular Mid Wales . countryside yesterday, nine women and three men on a murder trial jury . visited the house which, the prosecution suggests, she was destined . never to leave alive. Precisely what happened here is . something prosecuting lawyers say only one man must know. But Mark . Bridger, the former lifeguard accused of April’s murder, insists he . accidentally ran her over and has ‘no recollection’ of driving her here . to his home as she lay ‘dead or dying’ beside him in his Land Rover. Visit: Jurors arrive by coach at the home of Mark Bridger, Mount Pleasant in Ceinws, Mid Wales, on the third day of his trial for the abduction and murder of April Jones. it is surrounded by trees, outbuildings and a river runs down its left side . Trial: Mark Bridger says that he ran April down . with his car but cannot remember what he did with her because he had . been drinking heavily, claims which the prosecution refute . Poignant: Floral tributes and a single candle burns outside the white-washed cottage this morning,which the jurors stopped to look at . The Crown says he was already trying . to clean April’s blood from the rooms as hundreds of volunteers were . scouring streets and countryside in the hope of finding her alive. Bridger, 47, says he wishes only that he could remember where he put . her. The strong smell of cleaning products . that originally greeted detectives had evaporated, the jury were told . earlier, but otherwise it was much the same as it would have been that . night seven months ago. Twelve pairs of feet paced quietly around the . house; twelve sombre faces came out, some visibly shaken. Three bouquets . and a teddy bear had been left beneath the Mount Pleasant sign. Case: The prosecution say DNA and bone was uncovered in and around the fire and the bathroom door (right) despite a huge cleaning operation by the suspect, Mark Bridger . Home: Around his possessions blood was also allegedly found on and surrounding this white leather sofa . From photographs released by the . court, it was possible yesterday to take a virtual tour of the tiny . cottage perched on a hillside a short drive from Machynlleth, the small . market town where April lived. At first glance it looks little . different from any rural home a middle-aged man might be renting, and . certainly just as untidy. Cans of strong cider that Bridger bought with . that day’s benefit cheque are on the floor beneath a mounted rifle; . snapshots are framed on the walls; clothes spill from a laundry basket. Cottage: The property is in an isolated location, where witnesses say they saw Bridger pull up there in his Land Rover on the day of her disappearance . What is not immediately apparent is . the significance of the wood-burning stove in the lounge, a typical . feature of homes such as this. But this is where fragments of juvenile . skull were recovered from the ashes, and where nearby specks of April’s . blood were found. Not visible on the stove is the former . abattoir worker’s boning knife, which, the jury heard, had a charred . handle. More blood spots were found in the hallway and bathroom, . highlighted with green arrows placed by forensic experts who searched . the cottage. Prosecuting counsel Miss Elwen Evans . QC has told the jury that Bridger was ‘forensically aware’ and went to . extensive lengths to remove potentially incriminating evidence before or . after disposing of the body. If that was the case, the jury would have . seen at first hand the evidence that the attempt did not quite work. Later they were taken to the roadside . layby near where Bridger was seen carrying a black bin bag some 13 hours . after April disappeared. The jury’s day trip from Mold Crown . Court began with the same chronology that unfolded on October 1 last . year, with a visit to the spot where April was playing on the street . outside her home that evening with a friend. The last anyone saw of her, . according to the prosecution, was when she got into the passenger seat . of Bridger’s distinctive Land Rover Discovery parked nearby. Back then, almost the entire town took . to the streets to search for April. Now the same streets were virtually . deserted as the jurors, plus a small battalion of court officials, held . open-air sessions and a guided tour by coach. One face was missing, . though – Bridger, who denies abduction, murder and perverting the course . of justice, did not join the tour. In the dock: Mark Bridger drawn in court yesterday, as the jury heard he claimed he had searched for April Jones all night, but was seen with a black bin bag by a river the next day . Had it not been for the police escort, . the group might easily have passed as geography field trip enthusiasts . of the kind sometimes seen in these parts. But the man in an anonymous . grey suit was the judge, Mr Justice Griffith-Williams, and the coach . party included barristers from both sides of the case. Each time one of . them gestured with an arm towards some significant piece of evidence, . twelve pairs of eyes followed it. Among the sights were April’s school, . where Bridger went on October 1 to his daughter’s open evening; the . clock tower, where he claims to have ‘panicked’ before allegedly losing . all recollection of what happened next, and the CCTV cameras that picked . up Bridger’s various movements that day until he drove off with April, . allegedly to commit what the prosecution claims was a ‘sexually . motivated’ crime. Thus, the coach party effectively . traced his known route to the point at which he has said his memory now . fails him. On everyone’s account, it was April’s final journey. The trial continues.

Beneath grey skies, and then into the sunrise, a ten-strong bearer party carried and escorted a flag-draped, weighted coffin from St Clement Danes, the RAF church on The Strand. Timing: A gun carriage bears the coffin through the empty streets as dawn rises over London . Tomorrow this is where the coffin . bearing Lady Thatcher will be transferred to a horse-drawn gun carriage . after its journey by hearse from Westminster. From here, along Fleet Street and across Ludgate Circus, it will be taken to St Paul’s Cathedral for the funeral service. Duty: A servicewoman from the Royal Navy lines the streets . In a salute to Lady Thatcher’s celebrated legacy, the pall-bearers were selected from soldiers, sailors and airmen closely associated with the Falklands war. A single bell tolled as they set off for St Paul’s. They then moved along the route to the strains of Chopin, Beethoven and Mendelssohn funeral marches. On the day, thousands are expected to line the streets. Yesterday only a scattering of early-morning spectators got a preview of the event, involving nearly 800 servicemen and women. The rehearsal finished before most commuters had even begun their journey. In the interests of military precision, a final calculation confirmed that the procession would have to walk at 70 steps a minute over a journey of some 1,200 yards, as well as allowing time for choreographed pauses. It was clearly a useful fine-tuning exercise – the coffin is reported to have arrived three minutes and 15 seconds over schedule. Major Andrew Chatburn, who has the job of organising it all, said the rehearsal was vital to allow those taking part ‘to get a feel for how it’s going to go so they can perform their duties with confidence on the day’. And, of course, to do Lady Thatcher proud.","More than 700 serving armed forces personnel took part yesterday .

Instead, they were irresistibly drawn to the waistband of his scruffy jeans, which presented an altogether different question. Perish . the thought, but wasn’t that a bit of paunch hanging over the . 58-year-old former Cabinet minister’s belt? Just how tough was the . regime in one of Britain’s comfiest prisons? And doesn’t it have a gym? SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Too much porridge?

Chris Huhne’s ex-wife is to publish a book based on the diaries she kept during her recent two months in prison, her publisher said. The book, Prisonomics, will be published in early September, Biteback Publishing revealed. The book is not said to be a full memoir, but will draw on diaries the economist kept during her period in prison. The new book will use a style similar to Pryce’s previous publication Greekonomics, and is said to be a very personal book examining prison life, but also a hard-hitting economic analysis of the cost to the economy of keeping women in prison.

And, unlike his jeans, it looked to be brand new. Crime against fashion or hipster cool? Chris Huhne in his retro Harrington... and, right, how he usually looks . More usually found in a wool overcoat or dull suit, for his big reveal, Huhne had thrown on what looked to be a box-fresh Harrington jacket over his button-down blue shirt. Since the Sixties, the short cotton Harrington, with its . checked Fraser tartan lining and button-up collar, has been the unofficial . uniform of mods, scooterboys and skinheads.

It was a daring style statement from a man we are more used to . seeing in a tailoring. And he could have pulled it off if it weren’t . for that pesky shirt. For while the aforementioned cultural trailblazers wore their .

One Great Wall isn't enough for China - but this latest creation won't do too well at keeping out advancing armies - because it is made from a staggering 85,794 Rubik's Cubes. The giant mosaic, the biggest of its kind in the world, is 220ft long and 13ft tall and shows the skyline of Macau. Each Rubik's Cube had to be solved by hand and placed onto panels before being assembled. The amazing mosaic has been designed by Toronto-based Rubik's enthusiasts Cube Works Studio. The record-breaking Rubik's Cube mosaic is 220ft long and 13ft high and shows the skyline of Macau . Toronto-based Josh Chalom has been creating art out of the toy for five years in his Cube Works Studio . Each of the 85,794 Rubik's Cubes had to be solved by hand before being assembled into panels then built up - taking five weeks alone . To buy so many of the toy in the UK would mean splashing out £857,082. And the unusual piece of art has been certified the largest Rubik's Cube mosaic ever created by Guinness World Records. Designer Josh Chalom, an insurance worker from Toronto, Canada, spent two weeks designing the mosaic. Each cube has nine pixels and Mr Chalom had to make sure that not one of the 772,146 pixels was out of place. The 53-year-old said: 'I've always been a fan of reading the Guinness World Records and wanted to create something magnificent, that made people go 'wow'. 'The Rubik's Cube has always fascinated me - it's one of those things that everyone can relate to, all around the world. 'At some point in our lives, we've all picked up one and either managed to crack it and complete the cube, or we've got fed up and given up. 'It just shows that you can create huge pieces of work from everyday items.' The designer, who has been creating art using Rubik's Cubes for five years, worked with graphic architect Nick Hall, who made blueprints for the designs. It took 90 days to complete the mosaic - and solving the Cubes one-by-one took five weeks alone. A team of 25 pitched in to assemble the final model. Mr Chalom said: 'I was inspired by the brilliant architecture that I saw in China. There are a lot of old and special churches, combined with new and advanced buildings. Mr Chalom said he was inspired by the old and new architecture of China, so recreated Macau's skyline in toy-form .

Josh Chalom pictured accepting the piece of paper that says he's a record breaker . 'I wanted to create something that showed the old and new China. The cubes came from a local Chinese factory and Mr Chalom was delighted with the final version. He said: 'I wanted to create something monumental and breathtaking - the reaction that we've had from people has been amazing. 'Some people have been blown away by what they saw. It's good to create something that makes people so intrigued and fascinated.

There were no celebrated faces among them, and certainly no dignitaries or royalty. But yesterday, in a swathe that stretched nearly three miles through London, the ordinary people of  Middle England turned out in their tens of thousands for Margaret Hilda Thatcher. There were dissenters, of course, but this was one day when the jeers were massively overwhelmed by the cheers. Scroll down for video . True Blue: Gloria Martin, a supporter of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, wipes away tears by the route of the funeral procession . Dog's eye view: A young woman holds up her patriotic pet (left) and supporter (right) holds her Maggie T-shirt . Tears: Union Jack and tissue to hand, a young man is unable to contain his emotions as the funeral cortege approaches . In a quite remarkable tribute to the woman many describe as our greatest peacetime prime minister, they threw flowers, applauded … and remembered a leader who, as a Falklands veteran paratrooper perfectly summarised it: ‘Put the Great back in Great Britain.’ Three decades ago it might have been unimaginable that so many might turn out to pay their respects to the woman once dubbed a schoolchildren’s ‘milk snatcher’, a prime minister who stubbornly stuck to her principles in defiance of what others thought was right. Yet this wasn’t a funeral to mirror the one afforded to Churchill in thanks for uniting the people; more an indication, perhaps, that hindsight had allowed so many to realise how much 11 years of Thatcherism might ultimately have shaped their lives for the better. From the heart of the Palace of Westminster, but without Big Ben to signal 10am, up along Whitehall to Trafalgar Square, it was thick with hundreds, later thousands of men, women and children, prepared to witness even the briefest of moments in history as the cortege passed beneath Nelson’s watchful eye. Love: A man proudly waves a homemade banner on the three-mile route of the funeral procession which was eight deep in places . Thank you: A City worker shows his appreciation to Baroness Thatcher . One middle-aged woman held up a placard. ‘Thank you Mrs Thatcher’ was all it said. Indeed, by 10am there was hardly a square foot remaining on which to stand, nor a single piece of street furniture to climb on. They were seven to ten deep in places and shoulder to shoulder as far as you could see. Others opted for a view from the top of office blocks. Fan: A boy flies the Union Jack flag at the funeral of Margaret Thatcher yesterday . Expensive City suits stood alongside mothers with pushchairs; pensioners beside children and grandchildren who should probably have been at school. ‘Here she comes!’ someone shouted, and all eyes turned westward. By the time the cortege came into view the crowds were so tightly packed it was a struggle to catch even a glimpse of the procession, save for horses’ hooves and the too many pairs of highly polished military boots to count. From somewhere behind the throng, an arm raised up to throw a white rose towards the coffin. One group of veteran paratroopers who fought in the Falklands stood to attention and saluted. Former lance corporal Mark Bonar Jones, 51, recalled those who lost their lives in 1982 and told me: ‘She put the Great back in Great Britain at a time when it was desperately needed.’ Beside him Captain Bob Darby, 63, said of the protesters: ‘They have a right to protest. That’s democracy … and that was the reason we went to war when the islands were taken over by a fascist regime. ‘If it wasn’t for Margaret Thatcher, they’d all be living under a different government now.’ An effigy of Baroness Thatcher in a noose was paraded through the streets and set ablaze in a former  mining village where there were beers rather than tears yesterday. Ex-miners, led by Arthur Scargill’s former wife Anne, cheered as they staged the ‘alternative’ mock cremation in Goldthorpe, near Barnsley. Villagers also let off fireworks in a deliberate snub to the dignified pageantry of the funeral service in St Paul’s Cathedral.

She starved our kids, there’s no jobs. She will never be forgiven.’ In London, outside St Paul’s, a minor scuffle involving 20 protesters broke out after mourners told them to ‘go away and have some respect’. Much of the anger was directed at former Labour prime minister Tony Blair with anti-war activists shouting ‘Shame on you’, as he arrived with wife Cherie.

Ebony Espree Berry's 16-year-old daughter Markea Blakely-Berry, who was mentally disabled, weighed just 43lb at the time of her death in Georgia in June 2012. Berry, 38, has been charged with murder and two counts of first-degree child cruelty. If convicted she faces a maximum of life in prison plus 20 years. Tragic: Markea Blakely-Berry, pictured left as a young girl, has died after apparent neglect from her mother Ebony Berry, right, who is said to be involved with a 'pro-hunger' group . Happy family: Markea, left, plays with a relative at a family gathering before her abuse began. The teenager was told not to speak with 'outsiders' Markea's other relatives revealed their suspicions that she was being abused and underfed throughout her short life. 'She hated her,' said the girl's grandmother Cheryl Goree. 'She punished her daughter. She didn't have to kill my grandbaby like that.' After Berry's arrest, Markea's family noticed that she had links via Facebook to a group which encourages hunger, according to WOOD. Ms Goree described how Markea had sent her a haunting drawing of Thanksgiving dinner - with a table heaped with food, but completely empty plates. Markea's father Mark Blakely said he was shocked at the apparent abuse. 'I can't even understand it,' he said. 'How could anybody do that to somebody? You wouldn't even do your worst enemy that way.' Haunting: This image of Thanksgiving dinner drawn by Markea shows the family with empty plates . Well-stocked table: But Markea was once so hungry she ran away from home and stole food from Walmart . The girl was born prematurely, which led to her having a mental disability - the origins of her mother's hostility towards her, according to relatives. The family lived for many years in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where Berry was investigated by child protective services several times. Mr Blakely told WOOD that his ex moved to Atlanta to evade officials: 'She ran to do wrong,' he said. 'Nobody helped, nobody tried to stop her.' When Markea and her mother were living in Georgia, she ran away from home and was found stealing food from a branch of Walmart. Neighbours told WSB-TV that they had never seen the girl or her siblings go to school. Devastated: Markea's father Mark Blakely, left, and grandmother Cheryl Goree, right, spoke of their grief right after the teen's death .

Call me back and let me know what's going on with the child"".' The girl was dead by the time emergency services arrived at her home. Markea's family paid tribute to the teenager.

Named and shamed: Labour councillor Theresa Gandy, 35, lost a legal fight to stay anonymous after she was found drunk in charge of a child . An Oxford-educated Labour politician has lost her year- long battle to gag the Press from reporting that she was arrested for being drunk in charge of her toddler. Tess Gandy, 35, who had previously been cautioned for a similar offence, was hauled in front  of magistrates last May to answer for her crime. But the former banking lawyer tried to prevent newspapers from identifying her and covering the case by applying for reporting restrictions. After magistrates refused to grant the application, she ordered her lawyers to seek an injunction and apply for a judicial review to prevent details of the case ever emerging. But the newspapers challenged the injunction in the High Court and judges have now ruled against  her, arguing that there was an ‘undeniable legitimate interest’ in reporting the case. Gandy, who has been a councillor in Lowestoft, Suffolk, since 2011, has now resigned as she felt the ‘publicity’ meant she could not continue in her role. Anti-censorship campaigners last night branded her actions a ‘classic attempt’ to abuse the right to privacy and prevent the public knowing the truth about her behaviour. The district councillor fought to keep her identity secret for almost a year following her arrest in Asda in Lowestoft last April. The store’s manager called the police after becoming concerned by Gandy’s behaviour while in charge of her two-and-a-half-year-old daughter. Her blood alcohol level was found to be four times the legal limit for driving a car. Gandy, who was cautioned for a similar . offence in August 2011, was arrested. She was later fined £100 and . ordered  to pay £85 costs and a victim surcharge of £15. Deep regret: Gandy said she felt she had let people down, and that she had used alcohol as a crutch to help her deal with post-natal depression and high levels of anxiety . During the hearing, Gandy’s solicitor, Mary-Anne Mir, asked magistrates to apply reporting restrictions to the case. Gandy said she was seeking help for . mental health issues and alcohol dependency and applied for an order . under Section 39 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. The act is used to prevent the . publication of information that might lead to the identification of any . children – not adults – who are involved in criminal proceedings. No evidence was provided about how the . child might be affected by its mother’s identification, other than that . it ought to be protected ‘from the serious impact of a press release on . this matter’. The magistrates refused to grant the . order, but Gandy’s lawyers served an injunction on the Lowestoft Journal . and its sister title the Eastern Daily Press, preventing any . publication of the case. They served an interim injunction . because Gandy’s solicitors were seeking a judicial review over the . decision by magistrates not to apply reporting restrictions. They argued the child would be . identifiable if the newspapers named Gandy, said she was a councillor . without naming her, or said what she was charged with. But the newspapers argued that it was . in the public interest and in the interests of open justice to publish . the details of her offence. Drunk in charge: The manager of the Asda in Lowestoft became concerned about Gandy's condition while she was in the shop and called police who found she was four times over the drink-drive limit . Judges Mr Justice Kenneth Parker and . Lord Justice Pitchford agreed and dismissed Gandy’s judicial review in . their High Court judgment. Mr Justice Parker said: ‘The criminal . conviction itself, although it attracted a relatively low penalty, was . far from trivial. ‘To be drunk in charge of a small . child of two-and-a-half years of age raises very considerable concerns . regarding the general welfare of the child, especially when a caution . had been administered not long before for the same offence.’ He said the caution – and the risk of . public exposure – had failed to deter Gandy from committing the offence a . second time, which ‘strongly suggested there might be more serious . underlying problems’. He added that Gandy was ‘an elected . councillor, and her conduct in public had twice fallen well below the . standard that could reasonably be expected of an elected official by her . constituents and by the public generally, who had an undeniable . legitimate interest in learning, through media publication, of how [she] . had behaved’. He said that Gandy’s mental health . problems and alcohol dependence were also details ‘which arguably the . public were entitled to learn through a press report of proceedings’. Padraig Reidy, spokesman for the Index . on Censorship campaign group, said: ‘It’s  a classic attempt to abuse . the right to privacy to cover up misdemeanours. ‘This case is a matter of public interest and involves an elected official.’ Gandy said she had turned to drink to cope with post-natal depression and anxiety. She said she had offered to resign at . the time but claimed the Labour Party and Waveney District Council . advised her she did not need to as it was a personal matter. She added: ‘I sought legal advice to . obtain an injunction to stop any printing of the story purely to protect . the privacy of my family and not for any personal reasons.’","Theresa Gandy, 35, admitted being drunk in charge of a two-year-old .

But when Wikipedia volunteers faced the question of what image to use as their main picture on the site's 'Human' article, they couldn't merely upload an image from their webcam. The page, which details facts about our own species in the most general terms, instead shows at the top an image of a rural couple from Thailand's indigenous Akha people. This is us: The rural couple from northern . Thailand's Akha hill tribe who are the main picture on Wikipedia's . article on the 'human', which has been the subject of fierce debate as . to its suitability . But critics have questioned whether the picture is actually most representative of 'human', given the range of circumstances and attributes associated with our species. There have even been accusations that the choice has more to do concerns for political correctness than choosing an image which best fits the subject it is intended to illustrate. It appears though that there is good reasoning behind the choice, and the decision was taken following lengthy debate between the site's volunteer editors. The main article image on the Human article on Wikipedia shows a couple from Thailand's Akha people, a hill tribe indigenous to the country's less-developed north. They are standing with their backs to a verdant valley, their faces are expressionless and they are wearing plain, functional farmers' clothing. The man carries the stem from a banana tree that will be fed to his family's pigs. Main picture: Where the image appears on the . Wikipedia page which details facts about our own species in the most . general terms. Critics have questioned whether the picture is actually . most representative of 'human' A Quora thread was started by one member of the question and answer community who recently asked why Wikipedia would choose this specific picture to describe 'human'. The questioner asks: 'I mean, are there no images that would better symbolise or be more representative of the species and its characteristics?' The top-voted answer by Todd Gardiner, a photographer from Seattle, points out that Wikipedia's editors had already had a long and at times heated debate regarding the suitability of the picture. At least one editor had suggested that the picture should show a 'modern' couple, such as an image of an 'industrial American business man and woman' who would represent 'the height of human progress'. Another claimed that this pinnacle of human achievement would be best represented by photos of the moon landings. The suggestion was dismissed because the images show the space suits, but not really the humans within. Others claimed that prior discussions had concluded that the engraving on the plaques on the Pioneer spacecraft should be used, which show figures of an apparently white and Western man and a woman intended to be seen by any alien life they come across. 'Height of human progress': Some of Wikipedia's editors suggested that a Western-style businessman would be more fitting for the page's main image, while others said the lunar landings would show how far we've come . There even accusations that the use of . the image of the Akha couple was a 'pathetic and bureaucratic attempt . at portraying modern humanity' since most humans now live in urban . areas. 'Let's face it: the . only reason this picture is here is because nobody wants to be deal with . the inevitable charge of racism for using a much more suitable photo of . a white or European person,' wrote Wikipedia editor F33bs. And there were even claims, summarily dismissed, that the image was sexist since it places 'the male ahead of the female'. For ET: The engraving on the plaques on the . Pioneer spacecraft, which show figures of an apparently white and . Western man and a woman and are intended to be seen by any alien life . they come across . After all the debate, editors finally concluded that the picture of the Akha couple is 'just about perfect' because it shows 'average' humans. They decided this because most people are not white-skinned, nor black, but in fact are a varying shade of brown; most people are from Asia which, with about 4.2billion inhabitants, is host to 60 per cent of the human population; within Asia, the most numerous group are East Asians, the region from which the portraits subjects hail. Taking into account criticisms that most humans were now living in cities, Wikipedia editor Martin Hogbin pointed out that most people 'throughout history' have been farmers, although an updated image could show a pair of factory workers. Further, most people throughout history have been male or female, with very few exceptions, Mr Hogbin explains, while most people have also been 'pretty poor, but not shockingly poor'. Thus it was decided to leave the photo as it stands.","Main picture on the online encyclopaedia's 'Human' article shows a couple from Thailand's indigenous Akha people .

Boeing confirmed that the five-foot . piece of rusted plane that was found behind the proposed location of a . mosque just blocks from Ground Zero is in fact a part of one of the . planes that crashed into the World Trade Center more than a decade ago. Officials said the 5-foot piece is a trailing edge flap support structure, police said. It is located closer to the body of . the plane and helps secure wing flaps that move in and out and aid in . regulating plane speed. Pivotal piece: The machinery was originally thought to be part of the engine but it is actually a portion of the 767 Trailing Edge Flaps from one of the two planes that slammed into the World Trade Center . Investigators initially thought it was part of the landing gear because both pieces have similar-looking hydraulics. Boeing officials told police the part came from one of its 767 airliners, but it isn't possible to determine which flight. Both hijacked planes that struck the towers, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were Boeing 767s. Workers discovered the part Wednesday . between a luxury loft rental building and a mosque that in 2010 . prompted virulent national debate about Islam and freedom of speech in . part because it's near the trade center site. The airplane part was discovered wedged between 51 Park Place, the site of the proposed 13-story Islamic cultural center Park51, and 50 Murray Street, a luxury apartment building in TriBeCa. Found: part of a landing gear from one of the 9/11 planes was discovered wedged between buildings with a mysterious rope around it . Other World Trade Center wreckage has been discovered at the buildings and around the area in years past. An inspector on the roof of the mosque site, which is under construction, noticed the debris and then called 911. Police documented the debris with photos and have secured the area as if it were a crime scene. The twisted metal part - jammed in an . 18-inch-wide, trash-laden passageway between the buildings - has cables . and levers on it and is about 5 feet high, 17 inches wide and 4 feet . long. The piece was found with ropes that . aren't believed be part of the plane. Police are trying to determine . whether someone had tried to lower the piece off the roof at some point . in the past, and the ropes snapped or the piece became stuck. 5-feet: The chunk found Wednesday was 5-feet long and police say they've secured the area, pictured, 'like a crime scene' Intact: The gear found mere blocks from Ground Zero, bears a clear Boeing ID mark . There's no indication that the part . was planted in the space, said Paul Browne, chief spokesman for the New . York Police Department. Of the nearly 3,000 victims of the . trade center attacks, remains of about 1,000 were never recovered, and . sifting the site for possible human remains was to begin Tuesday . morning, said the chief medical examiner's spokeswoman, Ellen Borakove. The area first will be tested as part of a standard health and safety evaluation for possible toxicity, she said. Police said the part would be moved . to a more secure location likely later this week, where a determination . will be made about where it will go permanently.

Britain's most notorious drug baron has been issued with an extraordinary warning to stop running his multi-million-pound criminal empire when he is released from jail. Curtis Warren, 48, a convicted killer who once topped Interpol’s most wanted list, is in a high-security prison serving a 13-year sentence for cannabis smuggling. In an unprecedented step, the order instructs the Liverpudlian to stop breaking the law. Last night, the drug lord’s lawyer said his client is expected to fight the order on the grounds of his ‘human rights’. Warren, the only drug dealer to feature on the Sunday Times Rich List, has an illegal empire estimated to be worth up to £300million. He is in Full Sutton prison near York. The proposed Serious Crime Prevention Order was brought on behalf of HM Revenue and Customs and signed by Alun Milford, the director of the Serious Organised Crime Division of the CPS. There will be a High Court hearing in December in which he will contest it. The terms of the order include: . Warren, a former bouncer once described as the ‘most successful British criminal who has ever been caught’, was jailed in 1995 while living in the Netherlands after Dutch police found a haul of drugs and banknotes worth £125million. While in prison, he killed a convicted murderer, Cemal Guclu, during a fight. Behind bars: Warren pictured in 2009 after being found guilty of a £1million drug smuggling plot . Warren had planned a cannabis-smuggling operation in Jersey (pictured) In February 2005, the Dutch police . charged him with running a drugs-smuggling cartel from his jail cell, . but the case was eventually dismissed because of insufficient evidence. Released in 2007, having served . two-thirds of the 16-year sentence, Warren was arrested the same year . and convicted of a £1million cannabis smuggling plot in Jersey in . October 2009. He was transferred under a prisoner exchange agreement to mainland Britain. He now faces a confiscation hearing involving £160million. Warren’s solicitor, Keith Dyson, said: ‘There will be a human rights challenge, of course. ‘These are very oppressive orders, they absolutely restrict your civil liberties and it is supported by a file of evidence that Curtis says is inaccurate. ‘In a nutshell, the evidence relates to his previous convictions.’ An HM Revenue and Customs source said: ‘This is a deliberate attempt to make sure his activities come to an end. He’s got a lot of money and a lot of influence. ‘He’s a gangster involved in organised crime. ‘We will take steps necessary to put an end to his activities. It’s designed to make sure people don’t profit from their crimes while they do time. ‘He’s a bloke who goes to jail with millions and millions of pounds. We take steps to make sure they don’t profit and cease to have influence.’","Curtis Warren is only drug dealer to feature on Sunday Times Rich List .

The term false flag refers to instances where covert government forces set up violent incidents in order to scare citizens into handing over control to federal authorities. Dan Bidondi of right-wing site InfoWars posited the loaded question, implying that the bombing was designed to increase federal authority.

Scandal: North Wales chief Mark Polin revealed details of the sex abuse investigation, which involved at least 140 victims over 30 years . One of Britain’s biggest child abuse scandals is likely to have been even larger than previously thought, police revealed yesterday. Dozens of former residents of North Wales children’s homes have given detectives ‘graphic’ accounts of appalling abuse at the hands of 84 staff – most of whom have never been prosecuted. Barely a decade after a £13million public inquiry that was meant to uncover the extent of the scandal, police yesterday revealed they had ‘significant’ new evidence of ‘serious and systemic’ abuse. Home Secretary Theresa May ordered the new inquiry after allegations on the BBC’s Newsnight programme last November that a public inquiry which looked at the scandal had failed to uncover the full extent of the abuse. The now-notorious Newsnight film led to Tory grandee Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated in the abuse. In their first major progress report yesterday, officers who have been sifting through the accounts of former residents of the homes revealed the appalling scale of the suspected abuse. And they warned that abusers who believed they had evaded justice should for ever be ‘looking over their shoulders’ in fear of arrest and prosecution. The Waterhouse Report of 2000 heard from 650 witnesses and led to the conviction of seven former care workers. The report, by former High Court Judge Sir Ronald Waterhouse, said sexual and physical abuse mainly focused on six council-run homes and two private homes between 1994 and 1990. Yesterday, however, Detective Superintendent Ian Mulcahey, who is leading the new investigation, Operation Pallial, revealed: . Scroll down for video . Probe: Police say a new inquiry has found that sexual abuse at North Wales care home homes, including Bryn Estyn in Wrexham (pictured), was much worse than first thought . Report: Details uncovered by the new inquiry were revealed by (l-r) Det Sup Ian Mulcahey of Merseyside Police and North Wales chief constable Mark Polin at a press conference today . Previous: High Court judge Sir Ronald Waterhouse previously looked at abuse in North Wales but today's findings show the situation was much worse than first thought . The investigation is running in . parallel with a review of the Waterhouse Inquiry by Mrs Justice Macur. Many ex-residents of homes including the notorious Bryn Estyn, near . Wrexham, have long argued that Waterhouse’s terms of reference – . focusing on abuse within the properties – meant claims of links to a . wider paedophile ring in the area were ignored. But the bombshell claim by Steve . Messham to have been abused by Lord McAlpine was discredited when he was . belatedly shown a photograph of the former Tory treasurer and conceded . he had named the wrong man. The furore last November led to the resignation of BBC director general George Entwistle after just 54 days in charge. Officers working on Operation Pallial . have made one arrest so far. A man was held in Ipswich last week and . then bailed. More arrests are expected. Among those who have given their . accounts of being abused to the new inquiry is Keith Gregory, who was a . Bryn Estyn resident from 1972-74 and is now a local councillor. None of his alleged abusers were . prosecuted, but he has given detectives the names of four he is prepared . to testify against and predicted more ex-residents would now come . forward.

The crew continued to film as Harris underwent emergency brain surgery during which his skull was removed leaving part of his head concave: they were present as he went into cardiac arrest and had his chest split open as doctors carried out heart massage. Only after, in the editing suite, were the scenes deemed too gruesome for air cut out.

It had proved the unexpected hit of the Discovery Channel when it first aired in 2005, drawing an audience of 4 million without any promotion. The episode showing Harris’s death was the third highest rated airing of any show in the network’s history. It had been a lucky spot having only ever been intended as a twelve-minute segment in a two-hour special, ‘Extreme Alaska.' And the phenomenal success was down to Harris – a different breed of man, according to show producer Beers.

He survived another month before dying in hospital of a pulmonary embolism at the age of 53. Both Josh and Jake Harris fished with their father on the ‘Cornelia Marie.’ It was Josh who discovered his father following his stroke aboard the boat that made him famous. The once powerful man was contorted and twisted on the floor of his cabin, trapped under a hundred pound bench that had been bolted to the wall by the side of his bed. His last act of strength had been to rip that bench from its place. The man who had prided himself on his physical prowess after a lifetime spent at sea, in conditions few could endure, was paralysed down his left side. As he was strapped to a backboard and winched form his boat to the hospital bed that would prove his deathbed, producer Thom Beer now admits he faced a moral and professional dilemma. 'Our cameras were there when they opened up his skull...Oh my God, it was so tough,' Deadliest Catch producer, Thom Beers . His film crew had spent several years with Harris, chronicling his exploits for the Deadliest Catch. The millions of followers would want to be with the man they had come to know and even admire. But, as Beers reflects: ‘We weren’t just interlopers who were going to walk in and say, “Hey you’re dying. Can we film it?”’ In the end it was Harris himself who took control, the last time he would do so. While the producers spoke with his sons and agonised over what to do and the star of the hit show lay dying, Harris gestured for paper and pen. He couldn’t speak but he could write and so he did: ‘You’ve got to finish the story,’ he wrote. ‘It needs an ending.’ Lovers: Phil and Mary in the early days of the affair that led to the turbulent marriage that produced sons Jake and Josh . Feckless: Phil with infant son Josh but fatherhood could not curb his addictions to drink, drugs, gambling and women . That ending was his own. As medics performed surgery the prolonged Harris's life by a few weeks, Beers recalls: 'Our cameras were there when they opened up his skull. Oh my God, it was so tough.' Harris’s story began five decades earlier. He was raised by his father, Grant a stoic fisherman from Seattle, after his mother died of skin cancer. She was just 27, her son only eight. As Harris’s own son, Jake, reflects: ‘My grandpa didn’t know how to raise a kid. So he raised a worker.’ Harris was working on his father’s boat while his peers played ball and were cossetted at home. Grant Harris tried to be a good father according to his grandsons Josh and Jake. Stepmommy Dearest: Phil's second wife Teresa whom sons Josh and Jake knew simply as 'Satan' But with his wife dead and the need to hold down several jobs to provide for his son, Harris had plenty of opportunity to run wild. And he did. Harris was voted Least Likely to Succeed on graduation from High School and seemed determined to fulfil that destiny for much of his early teens. He left home at 15. He tore around town on his motorbike, got into trouble with the law, drank, smoked, partied and finally, for want of anything else to do, returned to the only the thing her knew, working for free on board a crabber. His job was to clean bait and his nickname was ‘Dirt’ because of his lack of personal hygiene. Still, Harris proved himself a worthy crew member and with status and catches came money. With money came vices or at least, for Harris, the funds to indulge them. Much of this biography reads more like that of a rock star than a fisherman from Bothell, WA. At times it is all more redolent of Rolling Stone, Keith Harris than crabber Captain Phil. According to Josh: ‘My dad once told me that when he was a young crab fisherman, he’d get a big fat pay check, buy huge amounts of cocaine…rent the penthouse of a nice hotel, and rotate the girls in and out. ‘That’s how he lived his life for a long time. He’d get a check for $80,000 but after three weeks it was gone.’ He admits: ‘Pharmaceutical quality Peruvian flake cocaine and high-grade strains of cannabis were the way Phil rolled.’ One of the last images taken of Phil: a man who lived high on borrowed time . Addicted to speed: Phil with NASCAR driver David Reutimann, left, at Phoenix International Raceway in November 2008, loved fast cars, fast bikes and loose women all his life . Harris was a prodigious gambler who . could go through $300 of chips in three seconds. He fell madly in love . with first wife Mary – an unhappily married, mother of two working as a . dancer in a grotty club when they met – but neither she nor the birth of . their own children could keep him on the straight and narrow. Though he went for periods relatively sober and apparently faithful to Mary, their nine year marriage was characterised by a cruel mutual infidelity – a tit for tat game in which there could be no true winner. Drunk and high he once rode his Harley Davidson straight into the front room of the couple’s home. He crashed cars and he wrecked marriages – his own and those of others. Legend: Harris could 'pound a gallon of vodka,' without drawing breath . This was a man who could ‘pound down a gallon of vodka without taking a breath,’ before breakfast. Years at sea in the company of Russian sailors had given him an insatiable taste for Stolichnaya vodka. In 1991 after nine years of marriage and 14 years together Mary and Harris divorced. He fought for custody of their sons and, remarkably, won. Two years later he remarried. Jake and Josh make no secret of the contempt in which they held their stepmother, Teresa. In a shocking section of the book Josh describes her as ‘an evil creature,’ and admits that he and his brother referred to her as ‘Satan.’ They claim that she beat them and drove their father to depression. The couple divorced in 2003 after ten years of marriage and when Teresa died of a heart attack in 2011 Josh state: ‘I didn’t feel bad. She was one of the meanest people I ever met.’ Shortly before his death Harris asked his first wife, Mary, to marry him again. She turned him down, telling him he was a much better friend than a husband. Truth be known the man who emerges from the pages of this book seems a much easier person to watch than to know. He was wore his vices like virtues and remained an unreformed, unapologetic addict and wild man to the end.

A report has exposed serious flaws in the way the NHS handles complaints with patients and families routinely being treated ‘insensitively’ and ‘without compassion’ by staff. The Health Service Ombudsman warns that the system is ‘overly bureaucratic’ and ‘impersonal’ which ‘clashes’ with the needs of sick patients. One woman who warned managers that her mother was not being washed nor helped to the toilet was told to submit a complaint in writing which would be ‘acknowledged within 28 days.’ She said: ‘My mum could have died in that amount of time.’ Another elderly patient who tried to raise concerns was put off ‘brusque’ receptionists who refused to hand him a complaint form. He said: ‘Some of the reception staff are very brusque and fail to make eye contact. ‘It is as if it is such an everyday occurrence that it is not worth their while bothering to explain or take it further.’ ‘I might have pursued it further if a complaint form had been offered, or if I had been given advice of the “how to and who to complain to” variety.’ Dame Julie Mellor, Health Service Ombudsman said: ‘We know the process can be overly bureaucratic and impersonal, clashing with the needs of the unwell patient who simply wants to be heard, understood and have things put right simply and quickly. ‘People complain because they want to know what has gone wrong, they want an apology and they want to make sure others don’t suffer the same problems. ‘We see example after example of cases where hospitals aren’t using complaints as the vital source of feedback they are. Learning from patients, improving services and building trust all flow from managing complaints effectively.’ The Health Service Ombudsman investigates serious complaints from patients and relatives which haven’t been properly dealt with by hospitals. Last year it looked into 400 cases and found ‘serious flaws’ in the way they had originally been handled. Its . report warned that hospital staff fail to listen to patients and . families who raise concerns and do not make any attempt to put things . right. In some cases staff will even make ‘blatant attempts’ to cover-up their mistakes by falsifying patient records. An elderly patient who tried to raise concerns was put off 'brusque' receptionists who refused to hand him a complaint form . The daughter of one elderly man who complained about his care said there were ‘discrepancies’ between what she was being told. She said: ‘Not consulting my father or I was both disempowering and insensitive. ‘The deeper the investigation went the more discrepancies became apparent. ‘I was concerned that other elderly people might encounter similar experiences and would like to prevent more serious outcomes for those who do not have relatives to advocate on their behalves.’ Just two months ago a damning report into Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal where hundreds died from neglect warned of a ‘culture of secrecy’ across the NHS. The Government is now trying to make the health service more open by encouraging staff to raise concerns of poor care and make it easier for relatives to complain. And Labour MP Ann Clywd has been appointed to carry out a review of the complaints system after she witnessed the appalling treatment of her husband in hospital in Cardiff. She told the Commons last year how her beloved Owen Roberts died ‘like a battery hen’ after her repeated pleas for nurses to help him were ‘brushed aside’.","Health Service Ombudsman says complaint system is 'overly bureaucratic'

The UK Independence Party is to contest more seats at next month’s county council elections than the Liberal Democrats, it emerged today. The scale of UKIP’s ambitions was revealed as a new poll put the anti-EU party on 16 per cent, double the eight per cent who said they would back the Lib Dems. Election experts predict UKIP could can up to 40 council seats on May 2, with the Tories and Lib Dems braced for heavy losses. Almost 10,000 people are contesting almost 2,500 seats on in local elections in England and Wales on May 2 . Battleground: UKIP leader Nigel Farage is confident of winning more votes on May 2 than the Lib Dems. Nick Clegg, pictured today on his LBC phone-in, has focused his attack on Labour and the Tories . The revelation is a major boost for UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who wants to use the council polls to prove that he can take votes from all the main parties not just disaffected Tories. A new AngusReid poll puts Labour on 39 per cent, down three points since January, the Tories unchanged on 29 per cent, UKIP up five points on 16 per cent and Lib Dems down two points on eight per cent. Labour’s Ed Miliband is also under pressure to live up to his One Nation slogan by making big gains in the south of England. The Tories have challenged Labour to win an extra 1,000 seats, although pollsters predict gains of 370 are more likely. However, UKIP could be the big winner of the night with the party confident it can push the Lib Dems into fourth place in total votes cast. Tories fear they could lose 400 seats. The Tories swept the board in 2009, turning the electoral map almost entirely blue. Four years on they are under pressure from Labour, the Lib Dems and UK Independence Party . A surprise new poll put support for UKIP on 16 per cent, double the eight per cent who said they would vote for the Lib Dems . New figures released today reveal UKIP is fielding 1,486 candidates in 27 English county council battlegrounds, compared to the Lib Dems’ 1,443.  In Wales, where only the Isle of Anglesey is being contested, UKIP has 11 candidates to the Lib Dem five. However, the Lib Dems are fielding 67 more people in the seven unitary authorities which also go to the polls. A UKIP spokesman said: ‘We are standing many more candidates because we recognise the importance of boots on the ground, being involved at a local level. ‘ . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is on the campaign trail in Cumbria today, where he will focus his attacks on Labour and the Tories. He has used the campaign to accuse Labour of still being a ‘blank page in British politics’. He added: ‘They won’t accept for responsibility for what went wrong; they haven’t learnt from their mistakes; they have no ideas for the future.’ He used the party’s launch in Cornwall last week to directly criticise Labour and the Conservatives, claiming ‘you just cannot rely on the Tories to make the fairest decisions’. He highlighted waste at Conservative councils, including in Cornwall where taxpayers money was used ‘hiring taxis to ferry teas and coffees between council buildings’ and in the Cotswolds where £19,000 was spent on a ‘motivational magician’. But he did not refer to UKIP directly, despite the anti-EU party seeing the South West as a stronghold where it could make gains on May 2. Ed Miliband, pictured campaigning in Cambridge this week, is under pressure to make gains in southern England while David Cameron is braced for heavy Tory losses . The Tories are determined to cast the vote as major test of Mr Miliband’s ability to win outside Labour’s northern comfort zone. Conservative strategists point out that in 2009 the Tories were as far ahead in the polls as Labour are now. In 2009, the Tories won 35 per cent of the vote with Labour under Gordon Brown 13 points behind on just 22 per cent, pushed into third behind the Lib Dems. Today opinion polls put Labour up to 10 points ahead of the Tories. One Cabinet minister claimed based on a uniform swing Labour should gain 1,500 seats but 1,000 was more realistic. Labour has sought to downplay expectations, predicting just 200 gains. In 2009 it suffered catastrophic losses in areas where the party once dominated, including losing 28 of 44 seats in Lancashire and 29 or 32 seats in Staffordshire. Other councils where Labour is expected to make strong gains are all in the north of England, including Derbyshire, Durham, Nothumberland and Nottinghamshire. Labour hopes to build on gains made in local elections since Ed Miliband became leader, but the party has made little progress in the south of England . Tories are braced for hundreds of losses after gaining control of seven councils and 244 seats in 2009. Just a year before the general election which forced Mr Brown out of power, Labour lost of four councils and 291 seats. After being humiliated by the UK Independence Party in the Eastleigh by-election, the Tories will seek to portray UKIP as being allies of Labour, warning a vote for any party other than Conservatives will lead to council tax rises. Voters will be told that backing UKIP will allow Labour to gain control of councils and drive up bills. ‘If you want to put up your council tax, vote UKIP or Labour,’ will be a key message. In total almost 10,000 people are standing for election to 2,449 seats. A total of 12 Tories are already home and dry after being returned unopposed. However Conservatives have already lost a Surrey seat after failing to file nomination papers on time.","UKIP fighting 1,486 county council seats on May 2 to Lib Dems' 1,443 .

The first U.S. Navy squadron combining the use of combat helicopters with unmanned drones is 'the future of warfare', officials have said. The aircraft will be operated by a squadron of 140 sailors - called the 'Magicians' - who will work off coastal combat ships that are smaller and faster than destroyers and aircraft carriers. The Fire Scout drone - which can be controlled by a pilot up to 110 miles away and can remain in the air for at least eight hours - will be for surveillance and target acquisition. First: The first U.S. Navy helicopter squadron to include unmanned aircraft was unveiled in California yesterday . 'Magicians': The squadron of sailors will control the unmanned aircraft from distances of up to 110 miles away . Unmanned drones can also be loaded with missiles to carry out targeted strikes. Military use of potentially lethal drones has been a source of much controversy, with anti-war campaigners calling for an outright ban. A draft report for the UN Human Rights Commission this week called for a moratorium on the use of 'lethal autonomous robotics', until an international conference can develop rules for their use. Admiral David Buss said at a ceremony to introduce the new Navy squadron in California yesterday: 'We've been using multi-million dollar destroyers to chase Somali pirates. 'This approach is designed for near-shore environment where our current experience shows us we're most likely to encounter threats.' Chopper: Members of the new squadron pose with one of the unmanned Fire Scouts, which look and launch like a helicopter . The new approach combines MH-60 Romeo . helicopters the Navy currently uses with the MQ-8 Fire Scout, a Northrop . Grumman-built drone that looks and launches like a helicopter. Where . the helicopters are designed and built for antisubmarine and surface . warfare, as well as search and rescue, the Fire Scout will be equipped . and used for surveillance, target acquisition and relaying information . to its controllers, at least for now. The . unmanned aircraft is controlled by two 'pilots' on the ground or on a . ship up to 110 miles away. It can stay in the air for at least eight . hours, compared to the helicopter's maximum air time of 3.3 hours.

'Magicians': The Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 35, named the 'Magicians', will fly Sikorsky Multi Mission MH60-R as well as the Fire Scout MQ-8 B helicopter, seen here . The Navy has been testing the Fire . Scout since 2007 and deploying it since 2009, using it for . counter-narcotics operations and in Afghanistan. In 2012, two of the . drones crashed in separate incidents, and the Navy briefly grounded its . Fire Scout fleet. Another was shot down over Libya in 2012. The strengths of the Fire Scout lie in how long it can monitor situations, Buss told a news conference. 'Helicopters . can't stay airborne as long as the Fire Scout,' he said. 'With the Fire . Scout's endurance of up to eight hours, the helicopter crew can return . refuel, rearm and re-man while the Fire Scout maintains contact.' Buss acknowledged that the Navy doesn't have a playbook for how to mix manned and unmanned flying warfare. 'The . ink has not dried on any set of criteria yet,' he said.

For a man who seeks to claim the statesman-like mantle of Margaret Thatcher, Ed Miliband has an odd way of going about it. The Labour leader triggered comparisons with the much-mocked soapbox of the Iron Lady’s hapless successor John Major yesterday as he stood awkwardly on a pallet, microphone in hand, to address voters outside a shopping centre. Despite cutting a rather ridiculous figure campaigning in the South Shields by-election – the seat left vacant by his brother David’s move to New York – Mr Miliband is clearly determined to acquire some of Lady Thatcher’s gravitas. Scroll down for video . Boxing clever? Labour leader . Ed Milliband used a wooden pallet to address locals in South Shields but was confused with his brother David who quit as the town's MP . Onlookers questioned how useful the box was at making him visible to shoppers as they milled around the town centre . In an audacious speech today, he will suggest he has the same strength of conviction and determination to change Britain as Lady Thatcher did in 1979. ‘Back in the 1970s it was clear the country needed a new way of doing things – a new settlement – and so too today,’ he will say. ‘The old way of running our economy just doesn’t work any more.’ In a separate interview he praises Lady Thatcher’s ‘utter consistency of ideas’, which he suggests he shares. He adds that his flirtation with ‘wonky’ concepts like predistribution – his complicated plan to tackle inequality – is comparable with the manner in which Lady Thatcher’s policies and convictions were underpinned by ideology. ‘People sometimes say I’m too interested in ideas,’ he tells the Left-wing website Politics for the Common Good. ‘But getting the ideas right – the intellectual foundations – is absolutely crucial. And they’re particularly crucial in tough times. In tough times you’ve got to have a robust sense of where you stand.’ He suggests David Cameron lacks similar convictions, adding: ‘There’s no sense of consistency.’ But Tory MP Nick de Bois gave the claim short shrift, saying: ‘Ed Miliband’s record as Labour leader is one of no policies, jumping on bandwagons and never making one tough decision. Lady Thatcher would have enjoyed handbagging him to political oblivion.’ Meanwhile an Ipsos-Mori poll suggests voters also believe Mr Miliband has a long way to go before he is seen as a potential prime minister. Just 24 per cent believe he is ready to be Prime Minister, with 66 per cent saying he is not ready. Ballot boxes: Mr Miliband's use of a pallet drew immediate comparisons with Sir John Major's soap box tour during the 1992 general election campaign . To the left: The Labour leader points during a speech in which he rejected David Cameron's claim that 'we're all Thatcherites now' Brother David’s decision to quit British . politics for a big money job running a charity in New York triggered the . by-election in the North East constituency. Ed made a visit there today to drum . up support for Labour’s candidate Emma Lewell-Buck during a walkabout . and apparently impromptu speech in the high street. He . was immediately compared with former Tory Prime Minister Sir John Major, . who used a wooden box measuring 4ft by 3ft by 1.5ft to speak to voters . in the run-up to his surprise election win in 1992. He . said at the time: 'People say that you cannot do it these days. It is . fashionable to say, for security and other reasons, that you cannot get . up on a soapbox. I think you have to and I am going to do it.' Aides to Mr Miliband clearly think the idea should be dusted off again. An . aide to Mr Miliband insisted there was nothing unusual about the . pallet. 'Politicians use platforms so people can see them when they are . speaking,' he said. South Shields has had a Labour MP since 1935, securing a majority of 18,995 in the 2010 general election. The campaign push comes as a new poll puts Labour on its lowest level of support for a year. Alan Beatie (right) was among the people to mistakenly call Ed 'David' during a town centre walkabout' Spot the difference: Ed (left) was confused with his brother David (right) who resigned as South Shields MP to take up a job with International Rescue Committee in New York . The IpsosMORI survey found 38 per cent of people backing Labour, with the Tories on 29, UKIP 15 and Lib Dems 10. Two thirds of people disagree that Mr . Miliband is ready to be Prime Minister, 'significantly' behind both Tony . Blair and David Cameron at the same point before they took the keys to . Number 10. Two and a half . years before Mr Blair became Premier, 59 per cent said he was ready for . the top job while 43 per cent backed David Cameron. Tom . Mludzinski, deputy head of political research at Ipsos MORI said: . 'Labour are at a 12 month low as voters have doubts that Ed Miliband and . his party are ready to move into Number 10. 'While he does have two years to change their minds, even his own supporters are not yet fully convinced.' Speaking in South Shields, Mr Miliband used his address to dispute David Cameron’s claim yesterday that ‘we are all Thatcherites now’ because no one would seek to reverse the Iron Lady’s legacy. Mr Miliband said: ‘I don't agree with him and we are not all Thatcherites now,"" he said. ‘He may have been making the point that there are some things that happened in the 1980s that have not been reversed and people are not planning to reverse. ‘But there are lots of things that do need to change, we have learned about deregulation and the problems that creates. ‘There's things about our society that need to change as well so I certainly don't consider myself to be a Thatcherite and there are lots of people in the country who don't consider themselves to be Thatcherite either.’ Not ready to be PM: A new opinion poll reveals Labour at its lowest level for a year, with two thirds of people thinking Mr Miliband is not ready for power . Safe seat: South Shields has had a Labour MP since 1935, securing a majority of 18,995 in the 2010 general election . More than 30 months after becoming Labour leader, beating his brother David in a bitter contest, it seems voters still have trouble telling them apart – even in South Shield. According to reports he had to correct several people, including local resident Alan Beatie, who mistakenly called him David. He told locals: ‘It's great to be here in South Shields. Over the last 11 or 12 years since David became an MP, I have really enjoyed my visits here.’ He later had an ice-cream at Minchella's parlour. Last month David Miliband stunned colleagues by confirming he was moving to New York to take up a lucrative job with aid charity, International Rescue Committee. He made little attempt to hide the fact that his decision stemmed from the 2010 leadership defeat he suffered at the hands of younger brother Ed. He said it would be better for him to be ‘3,000 miles from the front bench’, adding: ‘I didn’t want the soap opera to take over the real substance of what needs to be done.’","Ed Miliband mimics John Major's soapbox - with a less impressive platform .

Tony Blair could get a funeral on the scale of that of Margaret Thatcher, the minister in charge of planning her ceremonial send-off has suggested. Despite claims that Britain is unlikely to see another political funeral on the scale of Baroness Thatcher’s, Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said he would have no objection to a similar service when Mr Blair passes away. Whitehall sources dismissed claims that it had already been decided that future prime ministers would not be afforded ceremonial services of the type watched by tens of thousands in London on Wednesday. Honour: Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said that he would have no objection to former Prime Minister Tony Blair, left, getting a funeral on the same scale as that of Margaret Thatcher, right . Fitting: Mrs Thatcher's ceremonial service, pictured, was watched by tens of thousands in London on Wednesday . Mr Maude, asked about plans for Mr Blair’s demise, and whether he envisaged a similar funeral to that of Lady Thatcher, told BBC Radio 5’s Pienaar’s Politics: ‘I don’t think it’s for me to say actually. I certainly wouldn’t object to that at all. ‘I think that’s very much to be decided between the government of the day and the family. I think the wishes of the family should be paramount and the wishes of the person themselves.’ A Whitehall source said there had been no detailed discussion about funeral services for any of the surviving former prime ministers - Mr Blair, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown. At only 70, John Major is now the oldest living former prime minister - the lowest age for the holder of that position at any time since World War Two. But the source added: ‘Francis Maude has made it clear he would not object to a similar scale of funeral for Tony Blair, who like Margaret Thatcher did win three general elections. No decision: A Whitehall source said there had been no detailed discussion about funeral services for any of the surviving former prime ministers - Mr Blair, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown. ‘Whether you like him or not, that is quite a big deal. Given the relative youth of our former prime ministers there has not been any detailed planning for this. 'Margaret Thatcher left very detailed instructions and most former prime ministers will have a clear idea of what they want.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg defended the use of taxpayers’ money for Lady Thatcher’s funeral, dismissing the objections of some Labour MPs by pointing out plans had been agreed under the governments of Mr Blair and Mr Brown. Questioned: Mr Maude was asked about plans for Mr Blair's funeral on BBC Radio 5's Pienaar's Politics . ‘There’s nothing new about the government of the day supporting funeral costs for significant public figures and, of course, former prime ministers - that is actually quite an established convention and has happened before,’ he told LBC radio. ‘These plans were not suddenly invented out of thin air, these were worked on over a long period of time, were pretty well established in detail by the previous government, not this coalition Government, and of course with the full consent, co-operation and support of the family. ‘Of course, I can hear that there are people who have differing views but whether you are for or against Margaret Thatcher, everybody recognises she was a very significant political figure and this was a big occasion and that it was done on a cross-party basis.’ Mr Maude said the bill will be ‘much, much less’ than the widely-reported figure of £10 million, but no official estimate of the cost has yet been released. The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘We will publish the costs in due course. I think people will understand it can take a little time to draw together the final costings for high-profile and significant events such as yesterday’s funeral. ‘That is what is being done, and we will publish the costs.’ Asked whether the figure would include the full cost of the thousands of police and military personnel who were present at yesterday’s event, the spokesman said: ‘It will take account of the fact that a significant proportion of the personnel involved in the funeral ceremony would already have been on working duty.’ Sir Mark Thatcher said yesterday that his mother would have been ‘profoundly moved and gratified’ by Wednesday’s ceremonial funeral, which was effectively elevated to a state occasion by the presence of the Queen.

Inconsolable: The mother of a four-year-old girl raped at home by a teenage babysitter says she regularly breaks down in tears (picture posed by model) The mother of a four-year-old girl raped by a teenage babysitter has revealed the pain that has haunted her since the horrific ordeal. The woman said there are days when she 'can't stop crying' after discovering her daughter had been assaulted by the 14-year-old son of a family friend. And the father is tormented by feelings of guilt for allowing the toddler to be left in the clutches of the disturbed babysitter. Speaking publicly for the first time since the attacker walked free from court, the couple blasted the decision not to impose a custodial sentence - and feared their daughter could bump into her rapist any day. Instead, the judge imposed a three-year community order after blaming ‘the world and society’ for his exposure to porn. 'Our daughter was just four years old and so small for her age, she was still wearing age two to three clothing. He was a lot bigger than her,' the distressed mother told the Sun. She said that when her daughter - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - told her what had happened she 'was sick' then fell to the floor crying. The teenager used the toddler's favourite Hello Kitty apron to blindfold her while he carried out the attack - promising her chocolate if she played his 'game'. The mother said the first chilling sign that something 'terrible' had happened was when she returned home and noticed  the apron wasn't hanging in its usual place, but was scrunched up on the floor. Still numb from what happened, she added: 'There have been days where I just can’t stop bursting into tears and I feel sick all the time. I can’t cope any more.' Her daughter, who is now five, knows 'something horrible' happened but doesn't understand what. The girl is likely to have counselling . as she grows up to deal with the long-term effects of the ordeal, but . both parents are 'worried' about what her future now holds. The girl's father, a businessman in . his 40s, told how they went to watch their older child in school play . while leaving the younger daughter with the boy, who they trusted and . had known a long time.

Cambridge Crown Court heard how he watched internet pornography every day . When the parents returned home nothing seemed out of the ordinary and they paid the babysitter £10 and he left . It was only when the father was getting his daughter ready for bed that she told him what happened. The Daily . Mail's Block Online Porn campaign has called for the introduction . of ‘opt-in’ systems, under which internet . service providers would automatically block pornography unless an adult . asked for it to be available. There is growing alarm about the impact of sexual content on the internet on Britain’s children. Just . three per cent of pornographic websites require proof of age before . granting access to sexually explicit material, and research suggests as . many as one in three under-tens has seen pornography online. The Department for Culture, Media and . Sport angered campaigners earlier this year by suggesting it was ruling . out the idea of an automatic block on porn, on civil liberties grounds. But . following the Mail’s campaign, ministers have now included questions . about the opt-in system in a public consultation document, launched last week  on the department’s website. He stormed over to the boy's home, just a few hundred yards down the road, and told his mother what the girl had said. Together they confronted the teenager . who denied the girl's claims - saying that she had walked in on him in . the bathroom and had seen him exposed. But when the concerned father returned . home and spoke to his daughter once more it became apparent that the . boy was lying and the police were called. The teenager admitted the offence to . officers the following day - telling them that he had lost his mind . because 'hormones' had taken over. 'I should want to rip this boy's head . off - but I think I let my daughter down,' the guilt-ridden father said. 'I blame myself because I left her in a room with him and made the . wrong judgment.' He said that even when his little girl tells him he's the best dad in the world, he doesn't believe it anymore. The teenager  - who still lives a few . hundred yards from the victim - wore his school uniform in the dock at . Cambridge Crown Court on Monday as Judge Gareth Hawkesworth told him he . would have received a six-and-a-half year jail term if he had been an . adult. Judge Hawkesworth said: ‘You have not . shown any particular sexual interest in children. I’m satisfied it was . impulsive and I believe you have become sexualised by your exposure to . and the corruption of pornography. ‘Your exposure at such a young age has ended in tragedy. It was the fault of the world and society.’ The boy told police who were . interviewing that he had regularly accessed porn on the internet at his . parents’ home without their knowledge. In court he admitted raping a . girl under 13. The mother of the victim says the . judge justified the lenient sentence by making a 'cheap point' to use . pornography as an excuse for what happened. She said the family of the teenager had been expecting him to receive a custodial sentence of three years and were shocked that he had walked free from court. The sentence 'just isn't enough' as it . sends the 'wrong message' about rape and could prevent other victims . from coming forward, she added. The Daily Mail is calling for an automatic block under which adult content would be filtered out by default. Users would have to opt in to see it.

The campaign has attracted the support of Deputy Children’s Commissioner Sue Berelowitz and Sara Payne, whose schoolgirl daughter Sarah was murdered by paedophile Roy Whiting. Tory MP Claire Perry, leader of an all-party group of MPs campaigning against open access to porn, said the rape case proved the ‘serious negative impacts’ such images can have on children’s lives. 'I believe an “opt-in” model, along with better education and awareness, would provide the best tools for parents to protect their children online,’ she said. Jon Brown of the NSPCC said: ‘This case underlines why we want a system where adults have to actively opt in to get access to internet pornography.’","Mother knew something was wrong after seeing daughter's Hello Kitty apron scrunched up on the floor .

The Texas fertiliser plant which exploded two weeks ago killing 14 people had previously been repeatedly targeted by thieves who tampered with tanks causing the release of toxic chemicals, it has emerged. Police responded to at least 11 reports of burglaries and five separate ammonia leaks at West Fertilizer Co over the past 12 years, according to 911 dispatch logs and criminal offense reports. Some of the leaks, including one reported in October 2012, were linked to theft or interference with tank valves. The discovery has led to questions over whether thieves could be responsible for the explosion. Ongoing investigation: It has emerged that West Fertilizer, pictured after the explosion, had previously been targeted by thieves . Target: Thieves previously stole anhydrous ammonia - used to cook methamphetamine - causing leaks at the West Fertilizer plant . According to one 2002 crime report, a plant manager told police that intruders were stealing four to five gallons of anhydrous ammonia every three days. The liquid gas can be used to cook methamphetamine, the highly addictive drug. In rural areas across the United States, the thriving meth trade has turned storage facilities like West Fertilizer Co and even unattended tanks in farm fields into frequent targets of theft, according to several government and fertiliser industry reports issued over the past 13 years. The cause of the blast at the plant in the town of West which injured 200 people on April 17 is still being investigated but officers have so far found no evidence to suggest that security breaches contributed to the incident. Anhydrous ammonia has also been ruled out as a . cause for the blast because the four storage tanks remained intact after the blast, . said Rachel Moreno, a spokeswoman for the Texas Fire Marshal's Office. Meanwhile, investigators are pursuing about 100 leads, including a call to an arson hotline and a tip that there had been a fire on the property earlier on the day of the explosion, according to Moreno. Authorities have not said whether either tip was credible. About 80 investigators from various state and federal agencies are contributing to the probe. They hope to determine by May 10 what caused the explosion, Texas Fire Marshal Chris Connealy said at a state legislative hearing on Wednesday. Security breaches: The thefts of anhydrous ammonia from the plant in West, Texas, caused five separate leaks of the toxic chemical . Tragedy: The explosion at the plant in the town of West, Texas, killed 14 people and injured around 200 . A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), one of several state and federal agencies that monitor security at chemical plants, declined to answer questions about the breaches of security at West Fertilizer Co. State investigators also declined to comment. But thefts of anhydrous ammonia are common in McLennan County, where burglars siphon fertiliser from trailer tanks into five-gallon propane containers, said McLennan County Chief Deputy Sheriff Matt Cawthon. After reviewing crime reports from the past 12 years and speaking to deputies who responded to some of the break-ins, Cawthon said security was clearly lax at the plant. The perimeter was not fenced, and the facility had no burglar alarms or security guards, he said. He added: 'It was a hometown-like situation. Everybody trusts everybody.' Chemical safety experts said the recurrent security breaches at West Fertilizer are troubling because they suggest vulnerability to theft, leaks, fires or explosions. Apart from anhydrous ammonia, the company stored tons of ammonium nitrate, a fertiliser that can be used in bomb-making, but no thefts of that substance were reported to police. 'Regardless of what triggered this specific event, the fact that there were lots of burglaries and that they were after ammonia clearly shows this plant was vulnerable to unwanted intruders or even a terrorist attack,' said Sam Mannan, a chemical process safety expert at Texas A&M University, who has advised Dow Chemical and others on chemical security. At the scene: Investigators have found no evidence to suggest that a security breach contributed to the incident . Ruins: Investigators are currently looking into 100 leads but still do not know what caused the blast . Owners of West Fertilizer, responding through a representative, declined to answer questions about specific instances of theft or the level of security at the plant. The company has encouraged its employees to share 'all they know' with investigators, said Daniel Keeney, a spokesman for the company. In a 2006 permit application with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), the company reported it would protect ammonia tanks against theft or tampering and conduct daily equipment inspections. A TCEQ spokesman would not comment about security measures. He said the agency's responsibility is to regulate emissions from the plant, not to oversee security. Documents from the Texas Department of State Health Services show the West plant was storing 540,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate and 54,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in 2012. Ammonium nitrate was among the ingredients in the bomb used by Timothy McVeigh to blow up the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995, killing 168 people. After that bombing, Congress passed a law requiring facilities that store large amounts of the chemical to report to the DHS and work with the agency to ensure proper security measures are in place to keep it out of criminal hands and protect against such attacks. West Fertilizer did not report to DHS, despite storing hundreds of times more ammonium nitrate than the amount that would require it do so. Depending on the grade of the chemical, companies are required to report if they store at least 400 pounds or 2,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate. A 2005 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study identified hundreds of cases in 16 states where anhydrous ammonia was stolen for use in meth production. Some illegal labs mix anhydrous ammonia with ephedrine or pseudoephedrine and sodium or lithium to make methamphetamine, the U.S. Department of Justice reported in 2001. Devastation: The owners of West Fertilizer declined to comment on the previous thefts from the plant which destroyed several nearby buildings when it exploded . There were at least 11 robberies at the Texas plant over the last 12 years with the most recent incident reported in October 2012 . In dozens of instances, the CDC said, the thefts by meth makers siphoning ammonia from tanks caused injuries or forced evacuations because gas was released into the environment. However, cases of ammonia theft have become less frequent since 2006, when new laws restricted the sale of pseudoephedrine, which is found in some common cold drug remedies, according to The Fertilizer Institute, an industry association. Police records show West Fertilizer began complaining of repeated thefts from the facility in June 2001, when burglars stole 150 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from storage tanks three nights in a row. Nearly a year later, a plant manager told police that thieves were siphoning four-to-five gallons of the liquefied fertiliser every three days. Company owners downplayed security risks in documents submitted to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality in 2006, saying thefts had dropped to zero over the preceding 20 months as meth makers now had found a substitute for anhydrous ammonia available at garden nurseries or major retailers. Yet burglars and trespassers continued to target the facility. Following a series of break-ins in late 2008 and early 2009, including one where a trespasser visited pornographic websites on a secretary's computer, police told plant manager Ted Uptmore - who has worked at the company for decades - to install a surveillance system. Later documents show the company complied. Uptmore did not respond to phone calls seeking comment for this story. The last record of tampering was in October 2012, when a 911 caller reported an odor 'so strong it can burn your eyes'. The firm dispatched Cody Dragoo, an employee often sent after hours to shut leaking valves and look into break-ins. That night, he shut off the valve but reported it had been tampered with. Two weeks ago, Dragoo, 50, was among those killed in the blast while responding to the fire.","Police called to 11 burglaries at West Fertilizer Co over .

Guests at a luxury hotel where two people were found dead in a swimming pool thought investigating police were part of a murder mystery party. The man in his 30s and woman in her early 20s were found in their swimming costumes when they were pulled from the bottom of the pool by staff staff at the four-star Down Hall Hotel on Saturday. However, the man, in his early 30s, and the woman, who was in her early 20s, were pronounced dead at the scene. Police are reportedly investigating . various theories including the possibility that the pair could have been . poisoned, overcome by toxic gases or drowned. A policeman stands guard at the Down Hall Country House Hotel in Essex, where a man and a woman were discovered dead in the swimming pool on Saturday night . The pair, a man in his 30s and a woman in her 20s, were discovered by a guest at about 7.30pm. Their deaths are so far 'unexplained' by police . A picture posted to Twitter by a hotel guest showed the cordoned off swimming pool today . The hotel regularly hosts murder mystery weekends and some guests reportedly believed that the arrival of police was part of the package. Jo Carter, 49, and Frankie Heritage, 56, checked in yesterday afternoon for their first ever murder mystery and believed the whole crime scene had been staged. Miss Carter, a personal assistant from Brentwood, Essex, said: 'We just thought it was all part of the build-up. 'We have never done a murder mystery before so we just thought they’d gone to a lot of expense. 'It all just seemed to be part of the weekend with a policemen and a van at the gate. 'It was only when we spoke to him (the police officer) and he explained that it would be much too expensive to stage with real police cars that we realised.' Mr Heritage, a builder from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, added: 'It is absolutely terrible what has happened as that’s someone’s daughter and son. 'Last night we still had dinner but the murder mystery didn’t take place. 'All the guests were talking over dinner about how it could have happened as it is a real life mystery.' The hotel is situated in more than 100 acres of woodland . The couple say that guests expecting . to attend last weekend’s cancelled event have been offered a free murder . mystery at the hotel at some point in the future. The emergency services were called to . the country house hotel in Hatfield Heath, on the border of Essex and . Hertfordshire, at 7.35pm on Saturday. The air ambulance helicopter was summoned to the 110-acre estate, but paramedics could not resuscitate the man and woman. Police said the pair from London checked in at the £150-a-night hotel together, but could not confirm if they were a couple. Their . families have been informed but police refused to reveal their . identities until post-mortem examinations have been carried out. The . ten-metre pool was open to hotel guests but was unsupervised. Another . guest said she had used the pool just 30 minutes before the bodies were . discovered. Essex Police interviewed guests from the two wedding parties on Saturday. Lucy . Sparks, 21, from Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, was at one of the wedding . receptions when police arrived at the hotel. She said: ‘We saw two . police officers rush through reception with a member of staff. There . were about five or six police cars outside and we saw the air ambulance . land. ‘The hotel just pulled a curtain to separate us and the party still went on as normal.’ The hotel, on the Hertfordshire border, is a popular wedding venue. Jade Goody tied the knot there in 2009 . Yesterday . detectives said they were not looking for anyone else in connection . with the deaths, which they are treating as ‘unexplained’. Chief Inspector Nick Lee said  his officers had found two people ‘submersed’ in the pool.

IF you are looking to buy a home, an area with good transport links, decent schools and low crime usually tops the wish list. But homebuyers might also want to find out if there are any plans to open a Waitrose in the neighbourhood. A branch of the upmarket store near your home could boost prices by up to 50 per cent, according to estate agents. Premium: Having a branch of Waitrose in a postcode can add up to 50 per cent to the value of homes, according to research by Savills . They examined how the cost of homes with a Waitrose in the same postcode compared to those in the rest of the same county. The verdict was that the typical price of properties with a nearby branch was 25.3 per cent higher. For example, a home in Amersham, which has a neighbourhood Waitrose, typically costs £456,000, while the average for Buckinghamshire is £360,000. The situation is even more extreme in  London, where a local branch can add an astonishing 50.3 per cent to average prices. Most expensive: The top 20 locations with the highest 'Waitrose premium' all have house prices at least 40 per cent above their local county average . ‘Our analysis identifies a very clear . house price premium in Waitrose store locations,’ said Sophie Chick, a . research analyst at Savills, which carried out the study. ‘It is . difficult to state with certainty that a Waitrose opening will boost . prices. But it is clear that buyers should expect to pay significantly . more for their home if they wish to have a store on their doorstep.’ She looked at Waitrose branches which have opened in the past five years and house prices in the same ‘postcode district’. These are locations which share the same first half of a postcode, such as SW3 or GU7. Miss Chick admitted there was ‘no real answer’ to whether Waitrose ‘gentrifies’ areas or if the chain only opens in areas which are already upmarket and so more expensive. The findings come as figures from the Land Registry showed that house prices in London are rising by £90 a day. But, in stark contrast, they are falling in most other towns and cities, including Birmingham, Bradford, Leeds,  Liverpool and Manchester. In the capital, the average home costs £374,568 after jumping 9.6 per cent in the last year. That is equal to an increase of £32,809 since March last year. Of properties selling for more than £1million in England and Wales, roughly two-thirds were in London. Around 13 homes every day change hands for more than £1million in the capital, according to the Land Registry. In Liverpool, house prices fell 4 per cent since March last year. The average home used to cost £93,514 but its value dropped to £89,974, a fall of £3,540 or nearly £10 a day. In Middlesbrough, prices fell 16.5 per cent. Overall, the Land Registry said the average house price in England and Wales is £161,793, up 0.9 per cent over the last year. Peter Rollings, chief executive of estate agency Marsh & Parsons, said the capital  continued ‘to operate in another realm’. Giles Hannah, managing director of upmarket estate agency VanHan, said: ‘International buyers, particularly from Asia, are fuelling demand.’ He said a weak pound meant they could reap big discounts on prices.","Houses near a Waitrose are 25 per cent higher .

Two men have been found guilty of raping a teenage boy in the toilets of a city centre department store. Alex Wilson-Fletcher, 42, and former Iraqi army intelligence officer Abdelkader El-Janabi, 55, attacked the 14-year-old victim in the Debenhams store in Manchester on a busy Saturday afternoon last summer. The boy was in the Arndale Centre at around 5.45pm on June 2 last year when he went to the toilets. While there he was approached by the defendants and led out of the Arndale Centre and forced to go to nearby Debenhams where he was raped, Manchester Crown Court heard. Facing jail: Former Iraqi army intelligence officer Abdelkader El-Janabi, 55, (left) and Alex Wilson-Fletcher, 42, (right) have been found guilty of raping a teenage boy in the toilets of a Debenhams department store . Wilson-Fletcher, of Oldham Street, Manchester, and El-Janabi, of Artillery Court, Ardwick, Manchester were today both convicted by a jury of two counts of rape and two counts of sexual touching following a two-week trial. The pair were tracked down after images from CCTV were circulated by police. They were remanded into custody by Judge Michael Leeming QC who warned they face substantial jail terms when they are sentenced on June 6. Earlier in the run-up to the assault at the retail giant's flagship Manchester store, El-Janabi told the victim: 'Come with us, you’re going to do anything we say and if you try to run away we will catch you.' The boy said he tried to run off, but was caught after being cornered by the two men. After the assault, he ran out of the four-storey department store and confided to a friend about his ordeal. Police were called after the boy’s mother found out about the incident. Brazen: The paedophiles attacked the 14-year-old victim in the Debenhams store in Manchester (above) on a busy Saturday afternoon last summer . Eljanabi and Wilson Fletcher were trapped after police issued CCTV of the rapists as part of a nationwide public appeal for help. It emerged the Iraqi had been seen 'hanging around' the third-floor toilets on numerous occasions by staff and had on one occasion been escorted off the premises. Wilson-Fletcher handed himself in after seeing his photo on a BBC 'wanted' website and was picked out at an ID parade due to his distinctive lazy eye. The boy was said to have been left 'absolutely devastated' by his ordeal. The assault began in the early evening of June 2 last year after the boy went to a gentleman’s toilet at Manchester Arndale Centre after leaving a youth club. As he stood at the urinals, El-Janabi and Wilson-Fletcher began staring at him. Giving evidence by video link, the boy said: 'I left the youth group at 5.45pm. 'I was walking near the Arndale and I needed the toilet. When I went in, some Asian person stood next to me and started staring at me, looking at me up and down.' Caught on camera: The pair were tracked down after images from CCTV of El-Janabi (left) and Wilson-Fletcher (right) were circulated by police in a nationwide appeal . The boy said he felt so ‘anxious’ and ‘nervous’ he moved along one urinal for more privacy - but Wilson-Fletcher had already entered the toilets and started eyeing him up on his other side. The youngster, who cannot be named for legal reasons, added: 'The Asian person grabbed my arm and said ""come with us, you’re going to do anything we say and if you try to run away we will catch you"".' The boy said a cleaner and some other shoppers were present in the toilets while he was threatened and said: 'I started panicking. He mumbled it to me - he said it to me so no-one else could hear.' The boy said he made a dash for it, but El-Janabi caught up with him, motioning the boy in the direction of the Debenhams store with his paper - with Wilson-Fletcher following closely behind. 'He tapped me with the paper. The white person was behind - if I had ran the opposite way, the white man would have been there', he said. The court heard that once inside the store, the victim was directed into the lift, they took up to the toilets. Denial: El-Janabi, an ex-Iraqi intelligence officer, claimed he had been tortured by U.S. soldiers which left him with long-standing knee injuries and said he was bedridden at the time of the rape . Pleaded not guilty: Wilson-Fletcher said he had 'no recollection what happened that day', but denied any involvement in an attack . Neil Fryman, prosecuting, said: 'They both went into the male toilets. A short time later, prosecution say, that Mr Wilson-Fletcher went into these toilets at Debenhams.' The two men then abused the boy before Eljanabi raped him as Wilson-Fletcher looked on. Mr Fryman said: 'The two defendants are in it together. It was a common enterprise. Mr Wilson-Fletcher was in full presence, knowing what was going on, intending it to go on and encouraging it to go on.' The complainant was examined and a nationwide appeal was launched, with CCTV images of the men. El-Janabi became a suspect after his flat caretaker alerted police after seeing photograph of him in a press release. Police visited his home in Longsight, Manchester, on August 23, 2012, but there was no answer. My Fryman said: 'Activity could be seen behind the door but the door wasn’t opened.' But police swooped the next morning at 7.55am and arrested El-Janabi at his flat, in which officers found DVDs strongly suggesting he had a sexual interest in young men. He was matched to the man in the CCTV footage by facial-mapping experts. El-Janabi who settled in the UK in 2012 later told police: 'I had nothing to do with this attack. I was not there. I was elsewhere. I didn’t know the complainant. I have no involvement in this whatsoever.' The court heard he had served in the Iraqi army as a military intelligence officer and fought in the Iran-Iraq war in 1980 and the Gulf War of the early 90s. He claimed he had been captured and tortured by American soldiers which left him with long standing knee injuries and said he was bedridden at the time of the sexual assault. Wilson-Fletcher said he had 'no recollection what happened that day', but denied any involvement in an attack.","Alex Wilson-Fletcher and Abdelkader El-Janabi convicted of attacking boy .

One of the prostitutes who is defending the alleged father and son pimps in court, was given a black eye by one of them - but says she deserved it, according to a man who offered to help her. As the court heard about the spacious suburban homes with swimming pools in the back garden and BMWs in the drive that the prostitutes were given, they were also told the men would verbally abuse the women and, in one case, gave Desiree Ellis a black eye in 2007. In recorded phone calls played in court, George Jr was heard to say to the women: 'You . like being a cheap ho?' and 'I’m waxing your a** in the morning'. Violence: Desiree Ellis with a black eye, which the court was told was caused by Vincent George Jr . Former prosecutor David Novick told the court that when he asked Ms Ellis about her black eye at the time, 'She said she deserved it, and it wasn’t . a big deal'. Vincent George, 55, and his son Vincent George Jr, 35, have been charged with money laundering and sex trafficking for allegedly forcing five young women into prostitution, and then beating them and withholding money from them. The five blondes from Pennsylvania would drive into New York City and work eight-hour shifts, turning tricks for $300 each in the backseat of clients' cars or posh Manhattan hotel rooms, according to testimony. 'She, I thought, was moving towards wanting help, but ended up not going that way,' Mr Novick, who  offered Miss Ellis help on July 27, 2007, said. 'I recall specifically her telling me that she got the black eye from her then pimp.' The 24-year-old however, denied she was a victim, and said she works 'with' not 'for' George Jr, according to the Daily News.

Despite the veneer of normality the prostitutes presented to the outside world, neighbors said they were suspicious of the women and the Georges, who lived about two miles from them.

Labour leader Ed Miliband wants to block the UK Independence Party from having a role in the TV leader's debates, it emerged today. The Tories were already opposed to the idea of giving UKIP leader Nigel Farage equal status ahead of the 2015 general election. Labour had thought UKIP would only damage the Tories' election hopes. Block: Ed Miliband, left, wants to prevent UKIP's Nigel Farage, right, from joining leaders of the main three political parties in the election TV debates . But strategists now fear UKIP's 'brand of anti-politics could damage all three main parties in unpredictable ways,' The Guardian reported. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg enjoyed a surge in the polls in the 2010 polls as a relatively unknown figure alongside David Cameron and Gordon Brown. Spotlight: Labour has joined the Tories in blocking UKIP leader Nigel Farage from the leader's debates held in the build up to the General Election . Until recently Labour had hoped to . capitalise on the rise of UKIP, hoping it would split the centre-right . vote and allow them to clinch crucial swing seats. But recent polls suggest UKIP has taken support from all the main parties. A source close to Ed Miliband insisted no final decision had been made on UKIP's involvement. 'We've got to get David Cameron to agree to it first. 'Without him there will be no debates, then we'll worry about keeping Farage out.' In the Eastleigh by-election UKIP came second pushing the Tories into an embarrassing second. A . poll by former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft found UKIP attracted the . support of 22 per cent of people who voted Tory in 2010, 19 per cent of . Lib Dem supporters and 17 per cent of Labour voters. Big threat: Labour and Tories fear their vote will suffer as people are won over by Nigel Farage's UKIP in increasing numbers . Lord Ashcroft has also warned Prime Minister David Cameron that he faces defeat at the general election in two years’ time. The Tories’ biggest donor of the last . decade put together a poll suggesting Labour will gain 109 seats at the . 2015 election, including 93 from the Conservative Party. Facing defeat: Polls by Lord Ashcroft, pictured, found the Tories are hemorrhaging votes to UKIP and face defeat in 2015 General Election . The predicted result by the former . deputy chairman of the Conservatives would make Ed Miliband prime . minister and give Labour a House of Commons majority of 84 seats. Lord Ashcroft told the Financial Times: . ‘Even now, 16 years after they dismissed us from office, many people . who would once have been natural supporters still do not think the party . is on their side. ‘Mr Cameron faces the unenviable task of showing, at a time of austerity, that his party is not just for those who have already achieved material success, while holding on to Tory loyalists and luring back those threatening to defect to UKIP.’ The main three political parties have all seen the threat posed by UKIP increase over the past few years. Conventional election wisdom among Labour had been that UKIP would only significantly harm the Tories. But there is growing concern among Labour ranks that the anti-EU party could fatally undermine its support also. The . recent high-profile defection to UKIP of a family member of a former Labour . Cabinet minister has compounded that fear. Liz Shore, the widow of Peter who served as Trade Secretary under Harold Wilson and Environment Secretary in Jim Callaghan's government, will stand for UKIP in elections to Cornwall's unitary council. Mrs Shore, 85, said: 'I have been against the Common Market since day one and voted against it in the referendum in 1975 – but this is for county not for country.' Her daughter Tacy and and her husband Bob have also moved from Labour to UKIP to stand in Thursday's poll. Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured campaigning in Worcester, refused to admit he would be borrowing more if he was in power . The new bid to block UKIP from the leaders debates and shore . up their own vote came as Labour's economic plan descended into chaos . today when leader Ed Miliband refused 10 times to admit that he would be . borrowing more if he were Prime Minister. Borrowing fell only slightly last year to £120.6billion, just £300million lower than in 2011-12. Mr Miliband was challenged repeatedly on how his promises to spend billions more on tax cuts and job creation schemes. But during tetchy exchanges on BBC Radio . 4 he refused to admit he would have to borrow more money to fill the . budget black hole in his plans, including a £28billion bill for his . Alternative Queen's Speech. In a further embarrassment for Labour, party officials were forced to ‘clarify’ remarks by Mr Miliband in which he appeared to suggest he would look to cut universal benefits for wealthy pensioners. He revealed during the interview that the Winter Fuel Allowance ‘needs to be looked at’, suggesting he would oppose Tory promises to protect benefits for all pensioners. But minutes later senior sources insisted the party position that it would protect the handouts had not changed. The Tories seized on the interview as proof Labour’s economic policy was in a ‘mess’. Significantly, Mr Miliband refused to say a Labour government would borrow billions more than the coalition, despite shadow chancellor Ed Balls conceding the point in recent weeks. Borrowing has remained stubbornly high for Chancellor George Osborne. It fell only slightly last year to £120.6billion, just £300million lower than in 2011-12.","Ed Miliband fears UKIP could erode Labour's vote in elections .

Former South Carolina Governor and current congressional candidate Mark Sanford must appear in court to answer a complaint that he trespassed at his ex-wife's home, according to court documents. The complaint says Jenny Sanford confronted Sanford leaving her Sullivans Island home on February 3 by a rear door, using his cell phone for a flashlight. Today he explained that he visited his ex-wife's home while she was out of town because he didn't want his 14-year-old son to watch the Super Bowl alone. The latest legal drama came with more backlash for the adulterous politician as the National Republican Congressional Committee announced that they would be stepping away from his campaign in light of the new revelations. Ex-couples court: Former governor Mark Sanford (left, now running for the state's open congressional seat) is accused of trespassing on his ex-wife's . Trespassing: Jenny Sanford's lawyer filed court documents stating that her ex-husband Mark repeatedly entered her Sullivans Island home (pictured) without permission . Sneaky: According to the complaint, Mark Sanford used his cell phone as a flashlight as he entered in and out of the home's rear entrance . Their decision to step back from the . campaign could serve as a fatal blow for the former Governor, as they . were reportedly debating whether or not they should spend millions to . help him beat his Democratic challenger, Elizabeth Colbert Busch. 'Mark Sanford has proven he knows . what it takes to win elections. At this time, the NRCC will not be . engaged in this special election,' the NRCC said in a statement. According to Politico, the NRCC . hadn't spent significant funds on the race up till this point, paying . only for some polling. But their injection of millions would have . certainly came as a strong show of party support for the returning . politician. The news of the court case, stemming . from a February 3 incident where Sanford reportedly was seen sneaking . out of his ex-wife's house on Sullivans Island, was validated after he . put out a statement attempting to explain the situation. Left behind: Jenny Sanford moved herself and her four sons- pictured here years before the 2009 affair- out of the governor's mansion shortly after the scandal . 'It’s an unfortunate reality that . divorced couples sometimes have disagreements that spill over into . family court,' Sanford said on Wednesday. 'I did indeed watch the second half . of the Super Bowl at the beach house with our 14 year old son because as . a father I didn’t think he should watch it alone. 'Given she was out of town I tried to . reach her beforehand to tell her of the situation that had arisen, and . met her at the back steps under the light of my cell phone when she . returned and told her what had happened.' Before ending the statement, he added a slight, hinting that darker forces may be in play. 'There is always another side to . every story, and while I am particularly curious how records that were . sealed to avoid the boys dealing with embarrassment are now somehow . exposed less than three weeks before this election, I agree with Jenny . that the media is no place to debate what is ultimately a family court . matter, and out of respect for Jenny and the boys, I’m not going to have . any further comment at this time,' he said. Picturesque: The Sanfords used their first Sullivan Island home as his gubernatorial campaign headquarters, but they sold it and Jenny bought this other Sullivans Island home (pictured) for $1.5million in August last year . Jenny Sanford says the visit violated . their divorce settlement, and Mark Sanford must appear before a family . court judge next month. The couple's divorce settlement . says neither may enter the other's home without permission. Mark Sanford . lives about a 20-minute drive away in downtown Charleston. Her attorney filed the complaint the next day and Jenny Sanford confirmed Tuesday the documents are authentic. The complaint filed by Jenny . Sanford's lawyer, Deena Smith McRackan, said that Mark Sanford has . 'entered into a pattern of entering onto plaintiff's property.' 'Plaintiff has informed defendant on a . number of occasions that this behavior is in violation of the court's . order and has demanded that it not occur again,' it read. On the trial: Jenny said that she is . purposefully trying to avoid weighing in on her husband's ongoing . congressional campaign, saying he should 'sink or swim' on his own . merits . In February of 2011, McRackan sent a . letter to Mark Sanford telling him not to trespass on Jenny Sanford's . property. A copy of that letter was also sent to the local police, . according to court filings. Jenny Sanford confirmed Tuesday that she has custody of the couple's four boys. She said the complaint has nothing to do with her former husband's efforts to rebuild his career in politics. She said it was filed with the court . the day after the incident and when a family court judge last month set . the case for the docket, it happened to be two days after the election. 'I am doing my best not to get in the way of his race,' Jenny Sanford told the AP. 'I want him to sink or swim on his . own. For the sake of my children I'm trying my best not to get in the . way, but he makes things difficult for me when he does things like . trespassing.' Divorced: Sanford is pictured in 2009 with his then-wife, Jenny Sanford. Their marriage ended in divorce after he admitted to cheat on her with Chapur . Called to court: Former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, pictured with fiancee Maria Belen Chapur, must appear in court after he was caught trespassing at his ex-wife's house . He faces Democrat Elizabeth Colbert . Busch on May 7 as he tries to regain the 1st District congressional seat . he held for three terms in the 1990s. Spokesman Joel Sawyer said the Sanford campaign had no immediate comment on the court documents. Sanford is trying to make a comeback after his political career was sidelined in 2009 after confessing an extramarital affair. As . a sitting governor, he disappeared from the state for five days only to . return and confess to an affair with an Argentine woman, Maria Chapur. He . and Jenny Sanford soon divorced and he is now engaged to Chapur who . lives in Argentina, though she has been seen on the campaign trail with . Sanford as he vies for the state's open congressional seat. Sanford . and Chapur shared their first public kiss on the night that he won the . Republican nomination in the race earlier this month. Family home: Jenny moved out of her husband's house following the revelation of his affair . Space: Jenny confirmed that she has custody of the couple's four sons . A spokesman for Colbert Busch said that the campaign had no comment on the dispute between the Sanfords. This is not the first legal dispute between the Sanfords since their acrimonious break up in 2009. Campaigning: Sanford asked his ex-wife to be his campaign manager since they made such a good pair in the past. She declined . In December of 2011, there was . another complaint against Mark Sanford brought by Jenny Sanford saying . he had not made the $5,000 yearly contribution for one of their son's . college education. Jenny Sanford said Tuesday that the matter has been resolved but would not comment further. Following their break up, Mr Sanford . took some time out of the public eye after his affair coincided with the . end of his second term as South Carolina governor. After serving in Congress from 1995 to 2001, he ran and won his first gubernatorial bid in 2002 with his then-wife Jenny at his side as campaign manager. She served as an integral advisor in all of his political campaigns. As such, her name was floated as a possible contender in the race, using her popularity and political prowess as key factors if she wanted to run as a congressional candidate in her own right. She told her husband that she was not going to run, and it came as a surprise to many that he then asked her if she would join his campaign. She declined. Even after he offered to 'pay you this time'. 'Jenny was an instrumental member of every campaign, and she did a fabulous job. She'll be missed,' he said to The Wall Street Journal in February. Now the woman at his side is 43-year-old Ms Chapur, a divorced mother of two sons who worked as a journalist in Buenos Aires.","The divorce settlement between the former governor and his ex-wife Jenny stipulates that they must have permission to be in one another's homes .

British tourists are being tricked into spending hundreds of . pounds on emergency medical care in Spain that they should get for free, it has . been claimed. Public hospitals are reportedly rejecting European Health . Insurance Cards and charging for treatment instead. Under the card scheme, Europeans should be treated on the . same terms as citizens of the country they are visiting. Any resident in an EU member country is entitled to get free state health care in a fellow member country by taking out an EHIC . In the case of Britons, the hospital bill would be picked up . by the NHS at a later stage. However, visitors to Spain, where healthcare is free, are . being told to pay up front and reclaim the cost via their travel insurance. It means those who have an EHIC, but have not taken out . travel insurance, potentially face bills worth thousands of pounds. Julia Manning, spokeswoman for think tank . 2020health, said earlier in the month: ‘We have heard many reports of holidaymakers being . told they must pay for treatment in Spain — despite having an EHIC card. The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) is meant to guarantee free or reduced healthcare in Europe . ‘These people are unwitting victims of the financial crisis and our Government should be warning about the dangers before we head abroad. We are in a situation when holidaymakers will have to check with their insurer before they leave home and say: “Will you cover me no matter what?” ’ Almost 11 million British tourists visit Spain each year. The country is facing huge cuts to its public services, which have left state hospitals running on a shoestring. Any resident in an EU member country — plus Switzerland, Norway and Iceland — is entitled to get free state health care in a fellow member country by taking out an EHIC. British travellers are not entitled to the same free treatments as the NHS would offer over here, but what local residents would get in their country. Travel insurance is supposed to cover any shortfalls. However, over the last year the European Commission has received dozens of complaints from holidaymakers who have been denied treatment while abroad. Trade body the Association of British Insurers is investigating 120 cases of holidaymakers being turned down by Spanish doctors. The country is facing huge cuts to its public services, which have left state hospitals running on a shoestring - which has angered many of its citizens . Typically in these cases, sick tourists who need emergency treatment are being taken to the nearest clinic and hospital. On arrival they are asked whether they have travel insurance and the EHIC is generally ignored. In the worst instances, those who don’t are told they have to pay for treatment on the spot. If they can’t pay, they are sent to a different hospital. Official figures published three weeks ago revealed how Britain spent £247 million treating Spanish citizens last year. However, Spain spent just £3.2 million treating British people. A spokesman for the European Commission says: ‘We have been  receiving an increasing number of complaints about the European health insurance card being refused in Spain by certain public hospitals. ‘Many of these hospitals provide public and private healthcare and some tourists say they have been pushed to accept private treatment and use their travel insurance.’ The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) replaced the old E111 in 2006. The NHS warns that the EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance and does not cover any private medical healthcare or costs such as mountain rescue in ski resorts, being flown back to the UK, or lost or stolen property. It is meant to cover carriers of the card for treatment that is needed to allow them to continue their stay.","Hospitals in the cash-strapped country have refused to give free treatment to unwell holidaymakers .

A Zumba fitness instructor who turned her Maine studio into a brothel was sentenced to 10 months in jail Friday, bringing to a close a high-profile prostitution scandal featuring sex videos, adultery, exhibitionism and more than 100 clients. Alexis Wright was sentenced under a plea agreement to 20 counts including prostitution, conspiracy, tax evasion and theft by deception. Justice Nancy Mills extended wishes for success after the sentence was imposed. Infamous: Maine Zumba instructor Alexis Wright was sentenced to 10 months in jail and a $58,000 fine after pleading guilty to 20 counts, including prostitution, conspiracy, tax evasion and theft by deception . ‘Based on what you have to say and what I know about you from your attorney, I know that you will succeed when you're released and that you will prevail. I wish you success,’ Mills said. Wright's attorney said the defendant had a difficult childhood, witnessing domestic violence and suffering sexual abuse, before she met Mark Strong, her eventual business partner. She said Strong used her background to manipulate her. Addressing the judge through tears, Wright said she felt relief when police raided her business on Feb. 12, 2012, because she wanted out. She said she intends to work when she's released to help other women in similar situations. ‘In my eyes I'm free. I free from this. And I have an incredible amount of strength that I knew was in me somewhere,’ she said. ‘Now that I have the strength I want to encourage others to come forward. Do-gooder: Wright told the judge that upon her release from jail, she plans to work to help other women in similar situations . Victim: Wright's attorney told the judge that as a child, the Zumba teacher witnessed her mother suffering abuse at the hands of her father, who later weny on to molest her . ‘I want them to know that there's at least one person out there who'll believe their story, no matter how crazy it seems.’ She then added: ‘It's my intention to stand up for what is right. When I'm out, I'm going to pursue helping people fight through situations that are similar to mine. I'm optimistic that something good will come out of this.’ Afterward, she was led from court to begin serving her sentence. The 30-year-old Wright was accused of conspiring with an insurance business owner to run a prostitution business in which she videotaped clients without their knowledge and kept detailed records over an 18-month period indicating she made $150,000 tax-free. She also collected more than $40,000 in public assistance. According to a memo written by defense attorney Sarah Churchill and cited by the Bangor Daily News, Wright suffered severe childhood trauma in her 'formative years' after witnessing her mother being abused by her father, who later went on to molest her. When Wright was 8 or 9 years old, her parents separated and she moved to Califnoria with her mother. however, her fatehr kidnapped her and took her on a cross-country trip to Maine. 'I think we can all imagine the horrors that took place during that cross-country trip,' Churchill said. The lawyer went on to say that the severe trauma caused by the sexual abuse left Wright vulnerable to manipulation at the hands of Strong, whom she met while working as an exotic dancer to pay her way through college.

Kennebunk, known for its sea captain's mansions, beaches and New England . charm, became a sensation following reports that Wright had at least . 150 clients, some of them prominent. So far, 66 people have been charged, including a former mayor, a high school hockey coach, a minister, a lawyer and a firefighter. [caption . The . state will continue to pursue charges against additional people . identified on Wright's ledger if the evidence is strong enough to prove . the charges beyond reasonable doubt. Wright . was originally charged with 106 counts. All the counts in the plea . agreement were misdemeanors, including three counts relating to welfare . and tax fraud that were reduced from felonies. Under . the agreement, prosecutors will seek restitution of $57,280.54. Prosecutors say Wright cooperated with prosecutors and spared the state . an expensive trial. Her . business partner, Strong, 57, of Thomaston, was convicted of 13 counts . related to promotion of prostitution and was sentenced to 20 days in . jail. The married father of two, who has acknowledged having an affair with Wright, was originally charged with 59 counts. It . came as little surprise that Wright opted to avoid standing trial by . pleading guilty because evidence against her was overwhelming in . Strong's trial, with jurors watching a video of her engaging in sex with . a client who left $250, which she pocketed. Prosecutors say paid sex happened in her studio, apartment and an office, where tenants complained about moaning and groaning. Electronic . evidence was plentiful because the two kept in touch via text, email . and Skype, which Wright used to send a live video stream of sex acts to . Strong. Videos also showed them speaking openly of ledgers, payments and . scheduling. Explicit: Prosecutors played a video of Alexis Wright, 30, stripping off and teasing construction workers across the street from her exercise studio . For all to see: The video played for jurors shows Wright stripping out of her towel while standing in the window of her Pure Vida Zumba exercise studio in downtown Kennebunk, Maine . Not guilty: Mark Strong (right) admits he had an affair with Wright and his lawyers concede he may have watched video of her having sex with other men - but they argue he didn't know she was running an alleged prostitution business . Evidence . unsealed after the trial indicated electronic exchanges in which Wright . talked about the business goals: nine clients a week, 45 clients a . month. They also openly . discussed scheduling, insurance payments, her sexy outfits and clients' preferences. She even appeared to seek advice from Strong after . encountering an unhappy client. Business was running smoothly before it came to an abrupt end. ‘I . feel like this is going to be a good week,’ Wright wrote to Strong two . days before the arrival of detectives with search warrants on Feb. 14, . 2012. Wright had attended college classes . and ran dance classes for the local parks and recreation program before . opening her studio in Kennebunk. But she was also engaging in paid-sex . acts in the studio, in her apartment and in her office, law enforcement . officials said. Overseeing the operation and watching . the sex acts live on his office computer 100 miles up the coast was . Strong, a married father of two who ran a successful insurance agency in . Thomaston. Seductive: Mark Strong, a married father of two, . allegedly sat at his home computer and watched Alexis Wright have sex . with several men via live-streaming video over Skype . It came as no . surprise that Wright would seek a plea agreement because evidence . presented in Strong's trial was so overwhelming. A video played for . jurors showed Wright engaging in sex acts with a 61-year-old man who . then inquired about her rate before leaving $250 cash on her massage . table. After the man left, the video showed Wright pocketing the money. Wright's business partner allegedly watched the sexual encounter from his home computer via Skype. The damning evidence . against Wright, recorded by Zumba instructor herself on a camera hidden . in a nest of lingerie, shows her negotiating a fee and then collecting a . pile of cash after she finishes. On trial: Strong has pleaded not guilty to 12 charges of promoting prostitution and one count of invasion of privacy . In between clients, she discusses her . schedule of clients with a man who is watching through the video . camera. Prosecutors say that man is Strong, according to Seacoast Online. 'I'd like to schedule only two one-hour appointments tomorrow instead of 45,' Wright says, talking to the camera. 'Nice to get three in somehow,” the man's voice says. When Wright says that she has 'school' the next day, the man suggests she 'fit three in today.' Wright says that would be 'pushing it.' The man's voice later asks which clients he should try to book for her. The jury was also shown a video of the Zumba prostitute dropping her towel and posing naked in front of . the windows of her Maine exercise studio. She . describes how she is trying to get the attention of construction workers . across the street a she stands in front of the windows of her business. Wright, a 30-year-old single mother, is slated to stand trial in May. She has pleaded not guilty to all charges . Wright's alleged clients include wealthy and well-known figures in southern Maine. So far, 18 men have pleaded guilty to paying Wright for sex . 'I’m going to try and get them to . come over and have some fun,' she says as she stands on a chair in full . view of downtown Kennebunk. She drops her towel as she slowly tears a sign off the window. 'He’s taken notice. They’ve both taken notice. And now they’re watching.'

A pet Jack Russell terrier is set to be given an award after saving her owner's life during a late night house fire by licking her face. Barbie the dog alerted her owner Rosemary Field, 72, to the blaze as she slept at her Bristol home. The pensioner initially shooed her beloved pet away but the determined puppy didn't give up and eventually stirred Ms Field from her sleep. Jack Russell terrier Barbie saved her owner Rosemary Field (pictured) from a late night blaze at their home in Bristol . Partially-sighted Mrs Field realised her bed was ablaze after a lit bedside lamp toppled onto the bed, burned through a quilt and several sheets and blankets before causing the mattress to catch fire. The woman first tackled the fire with a jug of water before calling emergency services to her home. Fire crews who arrived told the pensioner the blaze would probably have been fatal but for Barbie’s brave actions. Relieved owner Ms Field said: 'I can't do enough for little Barbie now – I've been giving her lots of treats since it happened. 'She usually sleeps on my bed but when she started licking my face so early in the morning I was quite annoyed. Fire crews rushed to tackle the blaze after Ms Field attempted to extinguish the fire using a jug of water . 'It wasn't until I woke up more that I saw the bottom of my bed was on fire. 'I tried to put it out but there was a lot of smoke. 'My main worry was to get all my animals out but the cat wouldn't come.

'They told me it was very lucky that Barbie had woken me up, or I might have slept through it and died.'They said I shouldn't use the lamp anymore – I put it outside by my front door but someone has stolen it! 'I would like to warn them not to use it.' Today the RSPCA announced it would present an award to Barbie and her owner to recognise the dog’s bravery and persistence. RSPCA Bristol and district branch manager Eddie Grinham said: 'I was touched by how alert Barbie was to the danger her owner was in.

A little known but fatal illness called Valley Fever is spreading at an unprecedented speed across the Southwest due to the dry weather. The condition also known as coccidioidomycosis is caused when a naturally occurring soil fungus is disrupted and inhaled initially causes flu like symptoms but can become deadly if untreated. Government estimates say more than 160,000 people living in arid areas of the U.S. including large swathes of California and Arizona get the illness every year. Drought: Valley Fever is increased in dry weather conditions which are likely to be seen across the southwest in coming months . Under the microscope: Valley Fever also known as coccidioidomycosis is caused when naturally occurring soil fungus is disrupted and inhaled . Of that number 160 will die as a result and is the exponential rise in the number of cases year-on-year that is causing concern. 'I think suddenly people realized this was an ongoing problem,' Dr. John Galgiani, the director of the Valley Fever Center at St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix told CBS. 'But a small percentage of people get really serious problems, when the fungus either doesn't go away in your lungs, or it moves through the blood stream to other parts of the body, like the brain or bones or the skin.' His concerns were reiterated by Dr Royce Johnson, professor of medicine at UCLA and chief of infectious diseases at Kern Medical Center. 'Valley fever is a very common problem here, and it devastates people's lives,' he told the broadcaster. Increasing: The number of cases climbed exponentially up to 2011 - a record year for Valley Fever . Southwest: The illness effects arid areas of the U.S. which tend to be in the Southwest . 'But many patients don't know about it, and some physicians are only vaguely aware of it because half of our physicians come from out of state.' From 1998 to 2011, the number of Valley Fever cases rose by more than 850 per cent according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. In California alone cases rose from 700 in 1998 to more than 5,000 cases in 2011. Across the country there were 22,000 cases in 2011 but doctors estimate a further 150,000 were unreported. Valley Fever - also known as . coccidioidomycosis - is caused when a naturally occurring soil fungus is . disrupted and inhaled . In affected areas it is more likely when weather conditions are hot and dry and dust which carries the fungus is more common . It initially causes flu like symptoms but can become . deadly if untreated. It can damage the lungs, spread to the brain and bones and even cause blindness . Government estimates say more than 160,000 . people living in arid areas of the U.S. including large swathes of . California and Arizona get the illness every year . Of that number 160 people die as a result while 150,000 don't report it - in many cases not realizing they have it . Those most at risk include people who work outside in areas where the fungus naturally occurs . Both California and Arizona saw a slight drop in incidence last year but experts say they were exceptions to the ever growing trend. The illness is caused when tiny spores carried by soil dust are dislodged by construction, wind or human activity. In cases where the illness becomes . serious it can spread from the lungs to the brain and even eyes, causing . blindness, skin abscesses and organ failure. Warmer conditions create more dust and therefore more chance of illness - making this year's drought a real cause for concern. 'Research has shown that when soil is . dry and it is windy, more spores are likely to become airborne in . endemic areas,' said Dr. Gil Chavez, Deputy Director of the Center for . Infectious Diseases at the California Department of Public Health told . CBS. 62 inmates of California's Pleasant . Valley State Prison and Avenal State Prison were killed earlier this . month by the condition and the prisons' 3,300 inmates had to be moved . because infection rates were so high. Doctors said the high incidence . was a 'public health emergency'. In the same week 28 workers at a solar power plant construction site in San Luis Obispo County were taken ill. Last year, New York Mets first baseman Ike Davis famously caught the illness mid-season and was taken out of action. Valley Fever is caused by fungal organisms called coccidioides and when in the lungs can cause chest pain and coughing. Sufferer: Todd Scully - a winemaker in Paso Robles, California has Valley Fever and says he is in constant pain . Cutting out risk: Doctors advise those living in desert areas in California and Arizona, pictured, to avoid breathing in the deadly fungus . The disease is often misdiagnosed and sufferers often have no noticeable symptoms at all. A drought following a strong rainy season is the worst condition for spreading the disease. Rain causes spores to grow and then hot windy weather spread them. New residents in areas where the disease is prevalent are more susceptible because their bodies aren't used to the fungus while those who work outdoors in desert conditions are also more likely to catch it. Todd Scully - a winemaker in Paso Robles, California - is one such sufferer and he is in 'constant pain' according to CBS. Medication to treat the illness means he can't taste his own wine. 'It'll change your life, it's as simple as that,' he told the broadcaster.  'Sometimes it's excruciating, sometimes -- it's always a dull roar.' 'I know it's compromising my life, and I know it'll probably end my life sooner than later.' Doctors advise those working outside in summer months wear masks to try and avoid catching valley fever. Residents of arid areas are also advised to stay inside during dust storms and keep windows shut.","Doctors have warned that a dangerous season for Valley Fever may be ahead for many parts of the Southwest .

Joran van der Sloot, 26, is currently serving time in a Peruvian prison for the murder of local college student Stephany Flores in 2010. He is also wanted in the U.S. in . connection with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway, 19, from Alabama, . who went missing on a school trip in Aruba in 2005. When Van der Sloot's prison time in Peru is complete, which could be less than ten years away, he faces being extradited to America. Wedding bells: Dutchman Joran van der Sloot is set to marry his Peruvian common-law partner Leydi Figueroa Uced in the coming days . Van der Sloot’s lawyer has confirmed that his client is set to marry 22-year-old Leydi Figueroa Uced, reports The Daily Beast. She regularly visits Van der Sloot in prison and was last reported to be pregnant with his child, although no reports of the baby’s birth have ever been released. Conjugal visits are allowed in Peruvian prisons if a couple are register as common-law partners. Now it appears the couple are set to officially tie the knot in the next couple of days. Marrying a Peruvian could prove rather . convenient for Van der Sloot as it would probably save him from . extradition to the U.S. where he faces 25 years for extortion. Joran Van der Sloot walks handcuffed to a courtroom at the Piedras Gordas prison in Lima last May to fight extradition from Peru to the U.S. Reports had surfaced last year that Leydi Figueroa Uced was pregnant with Van der Sloot's child, although no reports of the baby's birth have ever been released . The Dutchman's extradition to the U.S. was approved last year in principle by Peru's Supreme Court, but only after he . serves out his sentence in Lima. He could serve less than ten years in . Peruvian prison for good behavior. Now, by marrying a local Peruvian, he . can automatically apply for Peruvian citizenship, which will hinder . America’s chances of ever extraditing him. In 2010, he was charged with attempting to extort $250,000 from Natalee Holloway’s mom in return for details about her daughter’s death. Van der Sloot took a $25,000 down payment and then traveled to Peru on May 14, 2010, . a trip that ended with the murder of Miss Flores, whom he met in . a Lima casino, on May 25. The date is a chilling one to the Holloway family, as it was five years to the day after the 18-year-old was last seen.

Taken away: Van der Sloot, centre, is seen escorted by police officers in Lima in this photo from June 2010, after his arrest for the murder of Stephany Flores . In prison letters released last July, Van der Sloot said hoped the Flores family could forgive him for his crimes. 'I ask God every day that Stephany's parents can find it in their heart to forgive me,' he wrote. But he also made an attempt to paint himself as the victim. He . said he believed he was misled by his attorney when he pleaded . guilty to Flores’ murder and that he suffers from ‘psychological’ problems that should have been weighed in the murder case. Mr Van . der Sloot wrote: 'My rights have been constantly abused. My lawyer . promised me I would receive 15 years if I plead guilty, I did.' He . also referred to himself as a psychological 'mess' in the letters, . which were written in English and contain numerous misspellings and . grammatical errors.

The star said it was only years later that she realised she had found herself in a scenario similar to the plot of Hollywood thriller Taken, starring Liam Neeson. Having stepped off a flight at the French capital’s Charles de Gaulle airport en route to a job, she said she got into a car with a strange driver who tricked her into thinking he was sent by her agency. Cindy Crawford said she nearly got kidnapped after she got into the vehicle of a man pretending to be from her agency . Miss Crawford, 47, said she got into the vehicle after seeing a man holding a card with her name. She assumed he had been sent to pick her up, ‘but then when I asked him questions, I realised he didn’t know anything. ‘I guess someone had seen me getting on the plane and he turned up there.’ Quick-thinking Miss Crawford said she waited until the car stopped at a traffic light ‘and then jumped out’. Miss Crawford jumped out of the car when it had stopped at a red light after she realised he didn't know anything about her . The supermodel also opened up about her body image issues and said she needs to 'come to terms' with her figure . At the time, she was in her 20s and at the height of her fame as one of the original ‘supers’ along with Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista and Tatjana Patitz. She had appeared on countless magazine covers and in high- profile ad campaigns. When she watched 2008’s Taken, she realised how similar her  experience was to the story of a man whose daughter is kidnapped in Paris after sharing a cab with a scout from a kidnapping gang. ‘I thought, “God, that could have been me”,’ she said. Speaking to Net-a-Porter magazine The Edit, the model also opened up about her body image. At 40, she claimed she was the happiest she had ever been with her shape, but as she approaches her 50s Miss Crawford said she is once again struggling to ‘come to terms’ with her figure. Cindy Crawford was nearly kidnapped when she was a young supermodel in her 20s (pictured) The mother-of-two admitted that despite her continued fame as a model, she would love to lose five pounds. She added: ‘I’m a normal woman, sometimes I feel pretty good and some days I’m like, “oh my God, nothing fits”. ‘My new resolution is that by the time I am 50, I want to have come to terms with my body.’ But Cindy said shifting the weight was not worth the gruelling regime it would take. She said: ‘For me, being five pounds lighter, what it would cost me . . . I don’t want to be like, “oh no, no salad dressing, no wine, no fun”.’ Talking about her early career, Miss Crawford said: ‘I was willing to do things that weren’t necessarily the next thing you should do, like MTV or Playboy, things that even my agency wasn’t sure about me doing. I was like, “why not? Let’s try it”. ‘I think some of the young girls saw me as someone who used the business back, not just getting eaten up by it. ‘It’s like women’s rights or everything else – you break the glass ceiling a little each time.’","Model arrived at Charles De Gaulle airport when at the height of her fame .

But Bowie Jane is the real deal, working full time as a straight-laced barrister during the day, but unbeknown to her colleagues and clients, she moonlights as a pop siren by night - often performing in front of thousands. The 27-year-old regularly rushed from the quiet court room to the stage, where she swaps her wig, robe and briefcase for Lycra suits and black nail polish. Scroll down for video . Disrobed: Bowie Jane is a criminal lawyer by day and - unbeknown to her colleagues and clients - a pop star by night. She even sometimes wears her stage outfits under her legal robes if she has to dash to a performance . Sometimes the singer even wears her costume underneath her legal robes to save time getting changed for evening gigs. 'I’m living two lives at once, by day one person and by night another, and sometimes it can get rather confusing,' she said. 'Music has always been my passion but my parents wanted me to get a degree and a proper job. For the last four years I have been juggling the two, working as a lawyer during the day and performing five or six nights a week. Appealing: She said: 'I'm living two lives at once, by day one person and by night another, and sometimes it can get rather confusing' 'It’s strange as the judges and my clients and colleagues have no idea that I sing.' Bowie Jane, who has just released her first single Luv Bomb, has a double degree in Bachelor of commerce and Bachelor of laws. She is qualified as a criminal lawyer in Australia and so is not able to work in Britain, although she does visit clients over here. Bowie Jane has performed at the Australian Open and has just released her first single 'Luv Bomb' She has tackled criminal cases for the last four years, but uses a stage name to cover her true identity and is keen to keep her pop career a secret from the legal world. 'I keep my pop music very separate and only a few very close friends know how I spend my evenings,' she said. 'Law is a male-dominated industry and very conservative and I’m worried that people wouldn’t take me seriously if they found out. It shouldn’t matter, but it does. 'I look and dress very differently at work compared to when I go on stage, which also helps.' Bowie Jane, who is from Melbourne, Australia, but spends half the year living and working near Marlow, Buckinghamshire, said the clash of roles had caused some problems. Once she had to be on the main stage at the Australian Open tennis tournament but was still in the middle of her working day and had to ask to be excused to go to a meeting. 'I literally hopped on a train, ran down there and changed into my clothes, then got onto the stage,' she said. She also finds it hard work when she has long trials and has to squeeze in song writing and gigs. 'Doing a trial wipes you out and I was keeping my fingers crossed that my cases would all finish in time for me to tour and promote my single,' she said. Bowie Jane, who gets more than 10,000 MySpace hits a month, writes her own tracks and describes her music as 'very pop, in that it’s catchy.' She is currently promoting her new single and touring.

The teenage girl forced to resign as the country's first youth crime commissioner after offensive rants were discovered on her Twitter account will not face police action, it was confirmed today. Paris Brown, 17, was appointed to the £15,000-a-year role to help Kent Police 'stay in touch with young people' by providing their views on policing, but stepped down amid claims tweets she posted on her personal account were homophobic, racist and violent. The teenager was questioned over the posts by officers from Kent Police's Special Branch, but the force said today it would take 'no further action' after concluding the case 'does not pass the evidential threshold for prosecution'. Scroll down for video . No further action: It has been confirmed that Paris Brown, seen right next to Kent's Police and Crime Commissioner Ann Barnes, will not face police action over her offensive tweets . A spokeswoman for Kent Police said today: 'We have spoken to the CPS about our findings, and given them our view that this case does not pass the evidential threshold for prosecution; we will make no recommendations to them for charges and will take no further police action having discharged our duty to investigate. 'Whilst some of the language used is offensive, particularly the comments which derogatorily refer to particular social groups, we do not believe that in the context they are grossly offensive on a reasonable objective assessment considering intent,' the statement went on. Remorse: The 17-year-old, who denies being racist or homophobic, as apologised for any offence caused by the messages posted online . In tweets posted on her personal account before she was appointed youth crime commissioner, Miss Brown called homosexuals 'fags', immigrants 'illegals' and travellers 'pikeys', and said she had 'a thing for older men'. In another tweet she wrote: 'I really wanna make a batch of hash brownies.' Miss Brown also posted: 'Everyone on Made In Chelsea looks like a ******* fag', in reference to the Channel 4 reality show. The Twitter account, which has since been deleted, was not checked as part of the recruitment process. Miss Brown, from Sheerness in Kent has since apologised for causing offence with the messages she posted between the ages of 14 and 16. She denied being anti-gay or racist, and said she is against taking drugs, insisting that the reference on Twitter to making 'hash brownies' was from a Scooby Doo film. The teenager's Twitter account was not checked as part of the recruitment process. Lawyers for Miss Brown had described Kent Police's decision to seize her mobile phone and question her under caution in the wake of the storm over her online comments as 'wholly disproportionate'. Law firm Olswang wrote to Kent Police Chief Constable Ian Learmonth to argue that the scope and nature of the investigation was 'unjustified having regard to the Twitter material itself and the broader circumstances of the case'. But Kent Police said at the time it was reacting to complaints from members of the public and seeking to establish whether any offences had been committed. The force received more than 50 complaints after details of Miss Brown's tweets came to light.","Kent Police said it will not recommend that Paris Brown, 17, be charged .

"By . Nazia Parveen . PUBLISHED: . 18:01 EST, 30 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:04 EST, 31 May 2013 . Keeley Reynolds was a happy-go-lucky teenager when she caught Mark Bridger’s roving eye. She was just 17 and saw him as her ‘first love’. He would go on to subject her to years of physical abuse – punching her in the stomach whilst she was pregnant with their child. Almost 26 years later, she described how the man she thought was a ‘gentleman’ isolated her from her family and friends before regularly beating her. Battered and bruised: Mark Bridger's ex-partner Keeley Reynolds pictured with the couple's baby Bobby, was subjected to years of physical abuse at the killer's hands . Guilty: Mark Bridger is pictured being led off to prison yesterday after he was found guilty of killing schoolgirl April Jones . After his violent attacks Bridger would take pictures of Miss Reynolds with a bruised face and place them in the family album as mementoes of his abuse. Miss Reynolds became a shadow of her former self and for years was unable to escape from Bridger’s systematic cruelty. She was devastated by her experience and went on to have years of therapy after suffering flashbacks and panic attacks. Now 43 and a mother of four, she says she has finally managed to close the door on her past. It was in 1987 that Bridger, then 21, moved to North Wales after leaving his Surrey home in disgrace following a conviction for firearms offences. He first lived on a beach when he moved to North Wales after buying survival equipment and camping gear. He then moved into a B&B near Miss Reynolds’s home in the tight-knit community of Blaenau Ffestiniog. ‘He was a very good looking lad and there were lots of ladies’ eyes on him,’ she said. Mark Bridger, pictured in make-up, was a womaniser who span lies to impress his young girlfriends . Make-up wearer: Bridger's former lover Keeley Reynolds claimed that she was attacked by him . Monster: Keeley Reynolds met killer Mark Bridger, pictured in a police mugshot, when she was just 17 . ‘He was a charmer and gentlemanly. He always made me feel safe around him. ‘We started dating two months after we met and he was my first boyfriend. I naively believed everything he said even when he told me he’d had a vasectomy.’ Six months later she realised Bridger had lied to her when she became pregnant with their son, Bobby, now 24. This marked a turning point in their relationship, with Bridger refusing to accept impending fatherhood and becoming increasingly aggressive. ‘He must have thought he was being trapped and losing control so he became volatile,’ said Miss Reynolds. ‘He started having arguments with me, regularly disappearing to the pub and it became common knowledge that he was sleeping with local married women behind my back. ‘He would speak to me through clenched teeth and I knew that things were going to take a turn for the worse.’ Despite her fears, Miss Reynolds left her family home to be with Bridger after he argued with her mother, Derry. ‘I was in love with him and thought he felt the same about me. His plan had worked. He had managed to get me on my own and completely isolate me.’ The young homeless couple moved into a caravan, where Bridger attacked a seven-months-pregnant Miss Reynolds. ‘He just flipped, grabbing me by the hair and punching me in the stomach before forcing me on to the floor and kicking me. I was so terrified I froze. ‘He did this a couple of times and every time he lost his temper he wouldn’t scream or shout. He was very cold and calculated and seemed to know exactly what he was up to.’ The couple moved into a council house. Bridger was now working in a hotel. Victim: Five-year-old April Jones was kidnapped while she played outside her home in Wales last year . ‘For a short while in our new home the beatings stopped. 'I secretly hoped he had changed. I was wrong and he started hitting me again but this time he focused on my face and would punch me until I was black and blue. ‘My mother would visit but he had just beat me so he would tell her that I wasn’t in. He would make me sit on a step for hours on end, sometimes for six hours at a time and he would feed me. ‘He would smack me in the face until it . was blue and then make me pose for a photograph with Bobby on my lap and . put them in the family album.’ Keeley Reynolds . 'It was almost as if he was treating me like a child or animal.’ Bobby was born in August 1988. ‘Mark became this loving father helping me with the feeds and bringing us home from hospital. But it only lasted a short while and then he was back to his old tricks. ‘He would smack me in the face until it was blue and then make me pose for a photograph with Bobby on my lap and put them in the family album.’ Bridger would parade Miss Reynolds in front of his friends showing them the injuries he had inflicted on her. In 1989 he subjected her to one of his most horrific attacks leaving her lying on the floor in a pool of blood. ‘He had smacked my head against the fireplace and just left me lying on the floor for ages. ‘I really thought he was going to kill me that day. But after he did it he just coldly walked over my body and then left. Bobby saw the whole thing.’ Tragic: The schoolgirl's body has never been recovered despite an extensive police search . Miss Reynolds’s stepfather Denys and mother heard about the attack and cowardly Bridger fled to Machynlleth. He tried to establish contact with Miss Reynolds but she refused to see him. He made maintenance payments of £5 per week for two years before he completely lost contact with his young family until Miss Reynolds heard of his arrest over April’s murder. ‘It was a complete shock seeing him on the TV and it has been particularly hard for Bobby,’ she said. 'I always had this feeling that he would . do something bad. It’s hard to accept that someone I had a child with . has done this to someone else’s little girl.' Keeley Reynolds . ‘But he hasn’t seen him since he was a child and he never wants to see him again. ‘To this day I still don’t understand why Mark turned out like he did. I met his family and they were very nice. 'I always got the impression that he was the black sheep of the family but they loved him. ‘But I always had this feeling that he would do something bad. It’s hard to accept that someone I had a child with has done this to someone else’s little girl. ‘He is a manipulative and controlling man with a unique ability to detach himself after doing awful things to other people. I will never forget his cold, evil eyes after he beat me. ‘He was incredibly methodical about his actions and had this way of disconnecting himself and I feel that’s exactly what he has done in this situation.’","Keeley Reynolds was just 17 when she she met April Jones's killer .

Success: BBC Newsreader Kate Silverton said the corporation should employ more older women and ethnic minorities . Kate Silverton has urged her television bosses to follow their American counterparts and do more to employ older women and those from ethnic minorities. The 42-year-old BBC newsreader said: ‘Let’s put it this way, they blooming well should. ‘It’s quite interesting, in America you get reminded how the American networks are very fair. If you are over 40 and are a woman you get pushed quite a bit. 'I don’t want to get too political on the female front but it is down to the producers as it is down to the commissioners who are choosing. ‘I say we should be celebrating all ages, sexes, colours and creeds. We should be doing that. 'All we can do is our bit and we have just got to forge a path and keep forging paths and keep hoping that the commissioners and producers will follow suit.’ Speaking to the same audience at a Royal Television Society event on the subject, Michael Wild, who edits Sunday Politics on BBC1, admitted that the ‘BBC has been very slow off the mark’ in dealing with the matter. He added: ‘With the BBC it takes a while to steer the big ship around but there is a lot of effort going on at the moment’. Mr Wild said he knew ‘word had gone out’ to radio stations across the country that it would be unacceptable if main daytime presenters are exclusively male. Describing her struggle to get to the top of her profession, Miss Silverton revealed it was a friend dying from cancer who persuaded her to give up her well-paid job in corporate finance to follow her dream of a career in journalism. Happy: Miss Silverton is married to former Royal Marine Mike Heron, left, after they met when he was an instructor on a course for BBC journalists going to war zones . She said: ‘I went in to see him. I had my big shoulder pads on and big hair and everything and I was very unhappy and he said to me ‘why are you not following your heart and what you want to do in your life? Look at me I don’t have much time left’. Miss Silverton took a job with the BBC in the north east and worked her way up from making the tea. She also made sandwiches on the side to make extra income. ‘When I started in TV I literally made tea and then politicians came in and I made them tea and slowly I learned about the job. I then got to talk to the Tony Blairs, the Mo Mowlams and then I would go away and learn. Making tea for people makes a hell of a lot of difference when you are starting out. When I walked into a newsroom for the first time I had no experience whatsoever but I knew I was home.’ Miss Silverton is married to former Royal Marine Mike Heron. They met when he was an instructor on a course for BBC journalists going to war zones. The couple have one daughter Clemency who Miss Silverton has referred to as her ‘little miracle’ as she was told it was unlikely she could conceive naturally and underwent IVF treatment unsuccessfully four times.","The 42-year-old said television bosses should follow US counterparts .

Google and Microsoft last night faced demands to act over the shocking ease with which child killer Mark Bridger used the internet to fuel his perversion. Bridger, sentenced yesterday to spend the rest of his life in jail for murdering five-year-old April Jones, had a sickening library of violent child pornography. It follows the revelation that Stuart Hazell, the man convicted earlier this month of killing 12-year-old Tia Sharp, regularly downloaded child abuse images on his mobile phone. Locked up: April Jones's killer Mark Bridger is pictured in drag. He had a sickening library of child pornography . Jailed: Sexual predator and murderer Mark Bridger is taken from court to start his whole life sentence in jail . Children’s charities and online protection experts are now calling for search sites to crack down on the way paedophiles can feed their fantasies with simple online searches. The verdict on 47-year-old Bridger, a former slaughterman, was delivered as: . Bridger used the search engines Google and Bing, which is owned by Microsoft, to look up terms including ‘naked five-year-old girls’, ‘nudism five-year-olds’ and ‘pictures of naked virgin teens’. Mother and daughter: Coral Jones cuddles smiling April tightly. She described how the family will never recover from her death . He also used Facebook to access  photographs of local girls, including  April and her half-sisters aged 13 and 16, and went online to save images of murdered Soham schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman. Child safety charities, including the NSPCC, demanded that the internet giants introduce immediate controls to stop paedophiles gaining access to child pornography. John Carr of the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety said: ‘If these images were not available on the internet then men like Hazell and Bridger might not go on to kill. ‘We cannot blame the internet for these people but it has opened pathways that lead them on to violent pornography and paedophile material.’ After five weeks of horrifying evidence at Mold Crown Court in North Wales, the jury of nine women and three men unanimously found Bridger guilty of abduction, murder and perverting the course of justice. Mr Justice Griffith Williams told him: ‘You are a pathological and glib liar. There is no doubt in my mind that you are a paedophile who has for some time harboured sexual and morbid fantasies about young girls, storing on your laptop not only images of pre-pubescent and pubescent girls, but foul pornography of the gross sexual abuse of young children.’ Bridger stared ahead blankly and nodded as the judge imposed a whole life order, which condemns him to die behind bars. Only 47 other criminals in the UK have been handed such a sentence. Fantasist: Mark Bridger, who is 'pathological liar and cold-blooded killer', will never leave jail  and waiting people yelled 'b******' as he was taken in cuffs to the man . Brave: April Jones's mother Coral spoke outside court, beside her husband Paul, and said they were relieved that Mark Bridger was found guilty . Bridger abducted April on the evening . of October 1 last year as she played on her pink bicycle with her best . friend close to their homes on the Bryn-y-Gog estate in Machynlleth, . Mid-Wales. He lured April . into his Land Rover Discovery and drove her to Mount Pleasant Cottage, . the remote rented home where he had been living alone since his . girlfriend dumped him. There, police believe, Bridger murdered her, dismembering her body before disposing of it in different locations. Despite . a huge effort by police and volunteers, April has never been found. Tiny fragments of a child’s skull, however, were discovered in Bridger’s . wood burning stove, alongside a boning knife. On . his Acer laptop, detectives found an incriminating library of vile . images. He had found the violent child porn by searching on Google for . simple terms, including: ‘France: British schoolgirl raped and . murdered.’ Trial: Mark Bridger faces life in prison for the murder of April Jones, . after the jury accepted compelling evidence he had abducted and murdered . her in a  'sexually motivated' attack . Happier times: Paul and Coral Jones, hold April and their other children on their wedding day, before their 'beautiful daughter' was taken from them . Bridger saved . photographs of various child murder victims, including ten-year-olds . Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, murdered by paedophile school caretaker . Ian Huntley in 2002. He had also downloaded numerous sadistic cartoons representing ‘extremely young girls’ suffering sexual abuse. Facebook . photographs of local young girls were also found on his laptop, with . files specifically dedicated to April’s half-sisters aged 13 and 16. Pictures . of April, who had cerebral  palsy and was born with a hole in her . heart, were accessed just eight days before she was abducted. Bridger . admitted killing April, but insisted he accidentally ran her over . before ‘blacking out’ and forgetting what he did with her body. Brave: Paul and Coral Jones, the parents of April Jones arrive at Mold Crown Court, where they have been every day during their daughter's killer's murder trial . Tragic: April Jones was abducted while she played on her bike (pictured), probably lured by Bridger into his car with the promise of a sleepover with his daughter . Cold-blooded: Killer Mark Bridger had pictures of himself holding this gun on his Facebook profile . Grim discovery: Mark Bridger's burnt knife recovered from his property in Ceinws, where April may have died . But . his despicable web of lies was destroyed by April’s best friend. The . seven-year-old girl became the central  witness in the case, bravely . describing  seeing April climb into Bridger’s car, ‘happy and smiling’. Yesterday, as the  jury dismissed his pathetic cover story, experts . spoke about how his obsession with online porn, and the ease with  which . he could access the vile images, contributed to his ‘sexually . motivated’ attack on April. Jon Brown of the NSPCC said: ‘Internet companies make millions and millions of pounds every year. ‘Google . need to do more in terms of blocking searches for child abuse imagery . but they also need to alert the authorities if someone is blatantly . doing these searches. Arrival: The media watch as Mark Bridger arrives in a prison before he is found guilty of killing the five-year-old . ‘We are very concerned that the ease with which they can get child abuse images to fuel their fantasies.’ A . report by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre has . identified a link between viewing child porn online and ‘contact’ sexual . offences against children. Scott . Rubin, director of communications and public affairs at Google, said: . ‘Google has a zero-tolerance policy on child sexual abuse content. When . we discover child abuse imagery or are made aware of it,  we respond . quickly to remove and report it to the appropriate law enforcement . authorities.’ A spokesman . for Microsoft added:  ‘When we are made aware of any illegal content we . remove it from our services, including our search engine, and report it . to the police.’ Upsetting: April Jones was shown on CCTV inside her local leisure centre after going swimming. The time shows almost 5.30pm and within two hours she had disappeared . Video: April is then seen heading through the doors after swimming with her sister and best friend - the last image that exists of the missing schoolgirl . Evil: The jury saw images of Bridger's Land Rover Discovery heading away from town - April would already have been in the passenger seat after being abducted near her home . Images: The jury were show Mark Bridger leaving his house and walking his dog on the day after he took April Jones .

The Moscow trial which could jail media tycoon Alexander Lebedev for up to five years has turned nasty over web taunts from the missing tycoon who he struck during an infamous TV talk show. Property mogul Sergei Polonsky is not attending court after the judge was told he is unable to leave Cambodia where he was bailed over the alleged kidnapping of sailors, even though there is credible evidence he is actually now enjoying a seaside break in Israel. Lebedev's supporters fear the TV fisticuffs is being used by powerful elements in Russia as a pretext to jail him in revenge for anti-corruption probes by his newspaper Novaya Gazeta. Missing: The hearing in Moscow is going ahead without Sergei Polonsky after the court heard he cannot leave Cambodia. But he posted this picture online, prompting speculation he is in Israel . Russian media magnate Alexander Lebedev, pictured left arriving at a court in Moscow, is on trial for allegedly punching businessman Sergei Polonsky, pictured right, because of political hatred . Rather than face charges for simply . hitting out, he is accused of 'hooliganism motivated by political . hatred' which carries a far tougher sentence. When Lebedev, 53, a former KGB spy in . London, claimed in a Tweet that 'Polonsky ran away from Cambodia to . Israel', his rival shot back: 'Are you scared?' In other recent volleys, he called . Lebedev a 'chukhan' - a dirty homeless person - and also used a word . loaded with sexual innuendo about the media owner, a wealthy businessman . and banker who bought the Independent titles and London Evening . Standard, before handing them over to his son Evgeny. Polonsky, 40, also taunted Lebedev as a 'double agent', adding threateningly: 'I'm going to get you.' Instead of airing his views in court, . he is using the web - but there was growing evidence that he is no . longer in Cambodia, despite court submissions by his legal team to this . effect and a Russian news agency report saying he is currently in Phnom . Penh for a hospital check-up. Recent pictures he posted online show him close to a glittering sea rather than landlocked Phnom Penh. Show: Mr Lebedev (left) lashed out at Sergei Polonsky during a Russian TV debate in 2011 . Excuse: Mr Polonsky is said to be unable to attend the trial as he is stuck in Cambodia . Lebedev has called on bloggers to . track down Polonsky so his whereabouts can be brought to the attention . of the judge, and is now convinced he is in Israel. A Russian MP - who gave a personal guarantee to a Cambodian judge that Polonsky would not leave . the country - said on Thursday: 'I have information from reliable . sources that Polonsky fled from Cambodia.' Alexei Chapa said: 'He accepted . obligations not to leave the country, I vouched for him. This situation . is very unpleasant for me.' He added: 'With his escape, Polonsky dealt a blow to the reputation of both Russia and MPs.' Even Polonsky's lawyer in Cambodia, Kong Radi, on Thursday told Mail Online: 'I don't know where he is. I am not sure.' He confirmed his bail conditions did not allow him to leave the country. The Chapa quotes were carried by . Novaya Gazeta and brought a swift response from Polonsky, saying from . his mystery hideaway that the Cambodian authorities were 'in shock' over . the claims and adding: 'Don't disgrace Russia, Lebyad' - an . unsympathetic play on his name. 'Your time is over, people of the KGB.' In a message to the Novaya Gazeta journalist, he said: 'You work for an enemy of the country - turn ON your brain.' The trial is due to resume in Moscow tomorrow, when Lebedev's witnesses are expected to start giving evidence. Lebedev has claimed he hit out during . the TV show because he feared Polonsky was poised to hit him. Pictures . from the programme went viral on the internet.

Bandage dresses have never graced the rails of my wardrobe, or the contours of my size 14, post-baby body. For, while the skin-tight dresses are a favourite of svelte celebrities like Victoria Beckham and Paris Hilton, they don't seem to have been designed with the lumps and bumps of ordinary women (or the practicalities of our daily lives) in mind. Yet now a new bandage dress, which has sparked long waiting lists in the British boutiques which sell it and has reportedly attracted a following from celebrity mothers such as Gwyneth Paltrow, seems to have been designed with mums in mind. The 'S' dress (the letter stands for 'shape', something I'm certainly keen to reclaim, 21 months after the birth of my son, William) by fashion label Mooi, claims to help its wearer drop a dress size, while being made of machine-washable, crease-resistant material. Dropping a dress size: Sarah Ivens modelling the Mooi 'S' Dress with 21-month-old son William . Could this be just the thing to take body-conscious mums from playdate to dinner party? It certainly sounds too good to be true: a designer dress that not only gives you a perfect silhouette, but doesn't require splashing out on dry-cleaning bills. It just peels down over your body and supposedly works its magic. And, since having William, my wardrobe could certainly do with some sparkle. Embarrassed by my weight gain, I've assumed the shapeless and sombre disguise worn by thousands of new mums all over the country. During pregnancy, my nausea was only kept under control by Wotsit sandwiches and the promptness of the delivery men at the local Raj Mahal takeaway. As a result, my stomach resembles the sort of thing parents hire for children to bounce on at parties, while my once-pert bottom has dropped a few inches and my boobs have been left somewhat deflated - which after years of dreaming of a smaller cup size is a massive anti-climax. So being confronted with a rainbow array of super-tight dresses on the brand's website was, frankly, terrifying. Could a 39-year-old mother really wear something spray-on and above the knee? Appropriate? Can a 39-year-old mother really wear something spray-on and above-the-knee? Comfort: All of the garments are without zips, buttons or labels - no busting, no straining . I selected four dresses to road test - a bright green, sleeveless dress with a black waistband, a long-sleeved blue, a ruffled black and a tan dress - which all looked beautiful on the website. Yet, when the parcel arrived, I was utterly horrified. For, while the manufacturers promise the dresses help make the wearer appear a size smaller, it seemed to be the dresses themselves which looked shockingly tiny. 'Each garment is made with 28 per cent elastane, which creates a slimming effect and the garment appears a size smaller.' This was certainly true. I gasped in horror when I unpacked the minute dresses, checking and rechecking the labels in case I'd accidentally been given an extra small instead of the large I'd ordered to cover my generous size 14 bottom. Nope, the label said large. No mistake. I'd have to take a deep breath and squeeze myself in head first. 'All garments are without any zips, buttons or labels,' says the blurb. Correct again. There is no danger of busting any zips or straining any button holes, which was a relief. 'The fabric slips around the body, very much like lingerie,' claims the marketing blurb. Well, I certainly didn't slip into the first one I tried on, a ruffled black number, but instead spent ten minutes furiously wrestling it over my curves. And after some vigorous tugging, the 'lingerie' the dress most resembled? Spanx control knickers. While I love the shaping underwear, a Spanx-style dress felt a little claustrophobic. This was probably down to the fabric, which had a neoprene feel to it, like a wetsuit. But the rubbery, tight structure of the dress wasn't necessarily a bad thing, I decided, thinking it could even pass as sexy, in a kinky, Fifty Shades Of Grey sort of  way. I ventured to the lounge to showcase my new look to my husband, Russell, wondering if it would distract him from Top Gear. You can be plastered with plasticine and still be ready for cocktail hour . 'You look nice, honey,' he commented . quite enthusiastically. 'That reminds me, I need to get the air pressure . in the tyres checked.' The next day - after discarding a beige . version of the dress which drained all the colour from my pale skin - I . donned a long-sleeved blue version of the dress and took my new look to . the streets. After all, the garments claim to have been designed to take . you from day to night, season to season. 'It is perfect for all climates,' enthuses model Victoria Fernandez, designer Tom Ford's muse, on the S-Dress website. 'I took it to Colombia, Peru, and now it is my dream dress in Paris.' But how would it fare going from Sainsbury's to a toddler play date, to my mother-in-law's house for dinner...on a rainy, grey day in England? Well, true to the manufacturer's words, it didn't crease - even when I ended up crouching on the floor, still damp from a recent downpour, to play with a train set with a group of grubby two-year-olds. And when William decided to decorate me with hummus and Dairy Lea triangles at my in-laws' house, a quick scrub with a damp cloth had me as good as new. As my final test, I chucked it into the washing machine with the family laundry, at 30 degrees centigrade as advised, and hoped for the best. I wouldn't normally dare put a £360 designer garment in with football socks or juice-stained pyjamas, but it re-emerged perfect. And, miraculously, the no-ironing promise held up. I let the dress dry on a hanger and the next day it looked pristine. So, have mums found a bandage dress which can flatter a mummy tummy and survive the sticky fingers of messy toddlers? The bright colours and flattering cuts certainly add a little va-va-voom while you vacuum, and the wipe-clean material means that you can be rolled on, jumped on and plastered with plasticine and still be ready for cocktail hour in the blink of an eye. And, most importantly of all? The body-shaping fabric whittles a waist and lifts a bottom that has seen better days, making the wearer look, if not a dress size smaller, then certainly more shapely. Which, for this mum, is worth the hefty price tag. www.s-dress.com .","New 'Spanx-style' bandage dress from Mooi comes in at a whopping £360 .

She has spent half an hour every day playing Scrabble for the last five years . Thousands of silver surfers have joined a boycott of Scrabble after the popular online version of the board game was replaced. Avid players said that they had built up close friendships around the world as they competed at the game on Facebook. Some had built up impressive player rankings after dedicating hours to the word game over the past few years. But overnight those high scores and . contact lists were wiped after the makers of the game enjoyed by . 3.5million users replaced it with a new version without warning. Kath . Ward, 72, from Dunstable in Bedfordshire said that she has now lost . touch with most of the online friends she had made around the world in . four years of playing. She . said: ‘My daughter knows that I like Scrabble, so when she found the . game on Facebook she encouraged me to join and I signed up just to play. ‘I . have loyally played it every day since unless I am on holiday or . terribly busy. I play for about three quarters of an hour to an hour . depending on how many games I have on the go. ‘I . have made friends with people all over the world. People were very . nice, you start off saying something like “that was a good word” and go . from there. ‘You get to know people. One of the people I regularly played with is in Spain and when we were there she invited us to visit. ‘It saved all your games, so you had a record of all the people you had played and your statistics. ‘This game means a lot to people – mostly silver surfers – they had dozens of friends on it. But it’s all been wiped overnight.’ Mrs Ward has joined the chorus of thousands of outraged users angry after Scrabble makers Mattel changed the online game earlier this week to a different version that does not have the previous data. She said: ‘People are saying how dare they do this? People are leaving it in droves. All the comments are total outrage at the way we have been treated. ‘I have a couple of the email addresses of people I played with, but not all. These are people I have been talking to for three or four years. ‘They have shown complete disregard to the people who have been playing the game for all those years.’ Game users have also complained that the new version of the game does not allow them to pick who they play against and have also dismissed the new design as ‘brash’. Helen Jones, 54, a support worker from Southport said: ‘I’ve been playing for the past five years. I’d play for around an hour of an evening when I come home from work. ‘I’ve met some really interesting people. Of course they do not substitute friends, but we had a community. I’ve just had a grandchild and a lot of the people I played with knew that and would ask how it was going. Classic: The makers of the beloved board game have outraged loyal players who work on building high scores and like to communicate with their opponents . Popular: Online and tablet versions of the game have been popular among 'silver surfers'. This iPad version allows people to play on-the-go . ‘We have lost all that and all the game records have gone. This is Scrabble, people are completely obsessed with their statistics. This is not some Candy Crush game. ‘We used to have a really classy board but now it’s vulgar. It has been totally Americanised. ‘They’re waking a sleeping lion by doing this. Our protest is growing momentum.’ Sarah Wilson wrote on the Scrabble Facebook page: ‘It’s garish and cumbersome... there is nothing in it for me so it’s over between us.’ Kevin Mercury Winder added:  ‘When I was introduced to Scrabble, I thought it was totally amazing, you were able to play with people all over the world, actually chat whilst game in progress… it was virtually like taking out a real scrabble board and sitting down to a game with a friend. ‘Now it has been ruined and for what reason?’ Neerja Singh wrote: ‘I cannot see the performance stats of the random players I am up against - I have 6,000 games under my belt, with a high score of 654. ‘I like playing tough opponents, I want to see the stats of several people online - and choose who I want to be pitted against! ‘I do not want to play some random beginner or somebody who is out to make lewd conversation. ‘Do not tell me which friends I can invite to scrabble. I have played - and thrashed the daylights out of friends. I don’t want to play against friends who take defeat personally.’ A spokesman for Mattel said: ‘The Scrabble Facebook game is now managed by a new partner EA Mobile. The benefits of the new game include gameplay across devices, the addition of the Collins Official Scrabble Wordlist, the ability to play in six languages, the option to customise boards and tiles and the option to play ad-free. ‘As part of the transition, we were unable to carry over ongoing games and statistics, the timer mode and the manual match-making function.

Obama officials have warned Cameron that they may not renegotiate with the UK if it pulls out of Europe . Britain risks losing out on £10billion a year in trade deals if the UK withdraws from the European Union, the Obama administration has warned. US officials have told their British counterparts that a vote to leave would exclude the UK from a transatlantic free trade deal which leaders hope to thrash out later this year. American diplomats believe it will be very difficult to get the so-called Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership – which could generate hundreds of billions of pounds worth of trade – through the US Senate. In a warning shot, they have made clear they would be very unlikely to strike a separate deal with Britain if the UK votes to quit the EU. Negotiations are due to start within weeks and David Cameron hopes to give it a boost when he hosts the G8 summit in Northern Ireland next week. But US officials have told the Mail that many US Congressmen, keen to protect local industries from competition from Europe, are suspicious of the plans. Downing Street officials were cock a hoop on Mr Cameron’s recent trip to Washington when President Barack Obama publicly backed his policy of renegotiating Britain’s role in Brussels before holding a referendum. Privately American officials have said they want Britain to remain in the EU, angering many Tory MPs.Gary Hufbauer, a former US Treasury official, said the Obama administration’s hopes of securing a trade deal would be sunk by a British exit from the EU. The European Union is in talks to negotiate one of the biggest bilateral deals ever with the U.S. and Cameron said it could be worth up to £10billion to the UK . ‘If the UK separates from the EU, I think will go a long way to derail the TTIP project,’ he said. ■  UKIP would beat Labour and the .

And it appears that Apple's phenomenal success is down to one Irish woman - an accountant called Cathy Kearney. One of the heads of Apple's Europe operation, the 49-year-old is believed to be a driving force behind the company's staggering financial success. The U.S Senate said the company paid little or nothing on tens of billions of dollars in profits stashed in Irish subsidiaries . A Cork-based Apple satellite company that she is director of reportedly earned $22 billion in 2011 – but paid just $10 million in taxes. It is this wealth of profits which has come under close scrutiny by U.S. officials eager to discover how the company has made so much money. Apple CEO Tim Cook answered probing question's about the company's tax strategy . Apple uses five companies located in Ireland to carry out its tax strategy, says a 40-page report issued by the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The probe, which saw Apple chief Tim Cook defending the brand before a Senate panel last week, discovered that Apple employs a group of affiliate companies outside America to allegedly avoid paying tax. The companies are located at the same address in Cork and they share members of their boards of directors - including media-shy Cathy Kearney, who has refused in the past to have her photo published. While all five companies were incorporated in Ireland, only two of them also have tax residency in that country. That means the other three aren't legally required to pay taxes in Ireland because they aren't managed or controlled in that country, in Apple's view. The company can legally shift profits to its different operations, which results in it paying less tax, the Guardian reported. Apple's arrangement has allowed it to . pay just 1.9 per cent tax on its $37 billion in overseas profits in . 2012, despite the fact that the average tax rate for countries in its . main markets was 24 per cent last year, says the report. The subcommittee's report estimates . that Apple avoided at least $3.5 billion in US taxes in 2011 and $9 . billion in 2012 by using the tactic. Cathy Kearney, a director of one of the subsidiary companies in Hollyhill, Cork, is said to be a 'driving force' behind the brand's success . Apple's tax strategy has allegedly meant that the Cork-born accountant has had to answer U.S officials' questions about Apple's tax payments. In a poll two years ago, the executive's 'shrewd direction' was hailed as one of the main reason's the company has enjoyed so much profit. At the panel meeting which saw Apple boss Tim Cook denied the company was a 'tax dodger', subcommittee member Senator Carl Levi said: 'Apple wasn't satisfied with shifting its profits to a low-tax offshore tax haven. 'Apple sought the Holy Grail of tax avoidance. It has created offshore entities holding tens of billions of dollars, while claiming to be tax resident nowhere.' Former presidential candidate John McCain said that while Apple claims to be the biggest U.S. corporate taxpayer, it is also 'among America's largest tax avoiders.' Apple says it complies with the law and pays 'an extraordinary amount' of tax. In an earlier statement the company said: 'Apple does not use tax gimmicks. 'And Apple pays all its required taxes, both in this country and abroad.' It declined to make any further comment to the MailOnline when asked to respond about Cathy Kearney.","Accountant Cathy Kearney is director of Apple satellite company that earned the brand $22billion in 2011 .

A coroner has asked the police to investigate the following what he called a doctor's 'extraordinary' delay in treating a seriously ill baby. Sheffield coroner Chris Dorries halted an inquest this afternoon and said he would be sending the notes to the Crown Prosecution Service to investigate a possible case of gross negligent manslaughter. The inquest heard that seven-week-old . Summer Hawcroft died from a severe brain injury after her artificial . breathing tube became dislodged in the neo-natal unit at Barnsley . District Hospital. There was a 'window' of about 30 minutes before Dr Vishwanath Kamoji, who was in charge of Summer, reacted and had the endotracheal tube changed. Experts said that it was probably during a 30-minute window that Summer Hawcroft was starved of oxygen leading to the brain injury . Heartbroken mother Michaela Hawcroft . accused locum paediatric consultant Dr Kamoji of 'killing her baby' after an expert said they hoped the doctor had learned from his . mistakes. Tearful Mrs Hawcroft, 26, interrupted the Sheffield hearing and said: 'It's all right sticking up for him. He killed my baby.' Experts have told the inquest the tube had been incorrectly fitted by Dr Kamoji and it was probable that the baby was starved of oxygen during this time, leading to the brain injury. Professor Simon Mitchell, a consultant neo-natologist called to give evidence for Summer's family, said there were several clinical failings by Dr Kamoji which amounted to a 'fundamental error' having been made. He failed to discover the tube had . been dislodged and properly assess the baby, did not secure her airways, . ignored the clinical picture and dismissed concerns voiced by fellow . nurses and a junior doctor. A professor told the inquest that there were several clinical failings by Dr Kamoji which amounted to a 'fundamental error' having been made in Summer's case . In the end he brought in an on-call consultant before making the decision to change the tube. Prof . Mitchell said: 'I think Dr Kamoji made an error in his clinical . judgment and this was a fundamental error during a resuscitation . situation which was compounded by failure to take account of information . which was being made available to him.' The inquest has already heard from . another paediatric expert Dr Martin Ward Platt that the consultant's . inaction during the 30-minute period amounted to 'gross failure' and he . should have changed the tube earlier. Summer was the seventh child of builder Stephen and Michaela Hawcroft . Summer, who weighed only two pounds and two ounces when born on April 23, 2011 by caesarean section after 27 weeks gestation, had a promising start but began to suffer breathing problems. She required several intubations and ventilation to aid her breathing but during the early hours of May 4 began to deteriorate. Dr Kamoji inserted a larger endotracheal tube at 2.40am but her condition worsened and she collapsed at 5.03am. Staff were particularly alarmed as the baby had a large amount of gas in her stomach. They summoned Dr Kamoji who arrived minutes before 5.35am and did checks but failed to spot the tube had become dislodged. It was eventually replaced at 6.03am. By this time the damage was done and Summer was transferred to a specialist unit in Sheffield where she died on June 11 when she was just 49 days old. Prof Mitchell told the hearing the tube fitted by Dr Kamoji was 'much higher than you would wish it to be' and the infant's abdomen was visibly distended indicating the tube was incorrectly placed. An X-ray was taken at 5.40am but not . viewed until 6am by the doctor. 'You would want to see it as soon as . possible,' said Prof Mitchell. 'If the tube is in the wrong place and . the baby is not being ventilated properly that is an urgent situation.' He . said the consultant's primary aim in resuscitating Summer should have . been to establish that Summer had a secure and open airway. The . lack of an airway was 'likely to have caused significant brain . damage. He added: 'There was a fundamental failure and it was unusually . persistent.' He did not believe there was any criminal culpability but calling in a second consultant to remove the tube was 'most unusual.' Summer's artificial breathing tube became dislodged in the neo-natal unit at Barnsley District Hospital . Dr Janet Rennie, a consultant neo-natologist called by Dr Kamoji's legal team, told the inquest the tube must have moved some time after 5am but nobody had been able to pinpoint why. Sher agreed there was an 'error of judgment' by Dr Kamoji in failing to replace the tube during the 30-minute window but in her opinion it was not serious enough to be reported to the medical authorities. He should have revisited standard resuscitation procedures when the baby collapsed and had adopted a 'blinkered' approach which was a breach of duty. 'As events did unfold it becomes less understandable and less rational but judgment becomes clouded by the stress of these situations,' she said. Summer was the seventh child of builder Stephen Hawcroft and Michaela, of Kendray, Barnsley. Pathologist Dr Mudher Al-Adnani said she died from a hypoxic brain injury which was 'quite extensive and widespread' but it could have been a combination of several factors rather than a single event. Dr Kamoji qualified as a doctor in India in March, 1993 and has practised in the UK since 2000. He has worked as a senior house officer on neo-natal units in Lincolnshire, Gwent, Leicester and Nottingham and has been on the specialist paediatrics register since August, 2009. After the inquest was adjourned Mtthew Brown, the family's solicitor said: 'Although they continue to grieve for Summer my clients are pleased that Mr Dorries has recognised the magnitude of the failures in her care at Barnsley Hospital by referring the case to the Crown Prosecution Service. 'We now await a decision on whether a criminal prosecution for gross negligent manslaughter will be pursued.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Inquest heard that seven-week-old Summer Hawcroft died from a severe brain injury after her artificial breathing tube became dislodged .

It was the first set of quintuplets ever born at the hospital. Less than 10 quintuplet sets are born each year in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention counted 37 babies who were born as part of a set of five or more in 2010. 'We feel like we're dreaming,' said Fernando Garcia in Spanish at a Monday afternoon news conference. 'It's incredible that we have five.' Early days: The 2 boys are still using breathing tubes, as the girls are breathing on their own. The infants are expected to have to stay at the hospital for another six weeks (pictured one of the unidentified newborns) Precious: The Utah couple used fertility drugs, which increases the odds of a woman having multiple births (pictured an unidentified newborn from the quintuplets born) The Utah couple used fertility drugs, which increases the odds of a woman having multiple births. They found out early in the pregnancy they were having quintuplets, and Guillermina Garcia had been in the hospital on bed rest since early April. All five babies were born by cesarean section – coming out within two minutes. A team of five, including one doctor and two nurses, was waiting for each baby. Their names are Esmeralda, Fatima, Marissa, Fernando and Jordan. 'I was excited to see them and see that they were ok, that everything turned out normally,' she said in Spanish. The largest is baby Fernando, who weighed 3 pounds, 14 ounces. The two baby boys are still using breathing tubes, while the girls are breathing on their own. Dr. Tracy Manuck served as Guillermina Garcia's doctor at the hospital and called the mother an extraordinary person who never complained, despite suffering from high blood pressure and severe pre-eclampsia during the pregnancy. The doctors also complimented her husband's support throughout the pregnancy – including in the operating room Sunday morning.

'He did not become a patient, which is a good thing,' Manuck said. Though the hospital had never had quintuplets before, they've had many women give birth to triplets and quadruplets and drew on those experiences to help them Sunday, Manuck said. The beaming couple, originally from Guanajuato, Mexico, now begins a future sure to be filled with droves of dirty diapers, endless hours of trying to calm crying babies and enough bottles and binkies to fill a sink. They also have a 1-year-old girl, Julietta. They said they have sisters who live in the area who will help them. Fernando Garcia's bosses have told him to take as much time off as he needs from his work as a welder at a local factory. The family has health insurance, but the Utah Doula Association has setup an account where people can donate to help with the costs of having five babies. When asked how she plans to care for all five babies, Guillermina Garcia shrugged her shoulders, laughed and said simply: 'I don't know.' Her husband smiled and gave a more confident answer: 'Now that they're here, we'll find a way,' he said. 'We're through the hardest part.'","Newborns weigh between 2 to 3 pounds each .

A woman who suffered the agony of losing three babies was stunned when she unexpectedly became pregnant with triplets - all in the space of two years. Gemma Schollick, 28, and her husband Stephen, 30, were devastated after the stillbirth of their daughter and a further two miscarriages. The couple decided to stop trying for a baby, instead concentrating on the three children they already had - Ben, eight, Josh, six, and five-year-old Sophie. In an attempt to put their heartache behind them, they decided to get married, but while they were on honeymoon in Cornwall in July 2011, Mrs Schollick became pregnant again unexpectedly. Gemma and Stephen Schollick had triplets after suffering a stillbirth and two miscarriages. They also have three older children. L to R Aidan, Gemma, Josh, Alfie, Stephen, Andrew, Sophie and Ben . After early scans, the couple were told they were expecting twins - but at a later scan, Mrs Schollick was ‘beside herself’ to be told she was expecting triplets. The discovery came after a string of heartaches for the couple from Haltwhistle, Northumberland. In early 2010, Mr and Mrs Schollick learned that they were expecting a baby. Although unplanned, the couple eagerly awaited the birth of their daughter - whom they had decided to call Amelia. Mrs Schollick carried Amelia full term, but during an antenatal appointment on December 27, 2010, medical staff were unable to find a heartbeat. The couple were told their daughter had died. Two days later - on Amelia's due-date – Mrs Schollick gave birth to the still-born baby. The couple discovered their baby had died more than a week earlier, leaving Mrs Schollick dangerously ill with a uterine infection. The couple had a stillborn daughter, Amelia, just a year before the triplets were born. She was born on her due date but had died in the womb . ‘It was really hard, really difficult,’ said Mrs Schollick, a part-time leisure centre worker. ‘It was an awful couple of days between finding out and giving birth. We didn't go out of the house. We were in limbo. ‘We used those two days to come to terms with what went on and what was going to happen. ‘The worst part was telling the kids. Ben, Josh and Sophie were all young but we had to tell them something, they were expecting a baby sister. ‘We said that Amelia had been poorly and the doctors couldn't fix her. ‘Then Sophie said, “Well you'll just have to have another one”. ‘Looking at Stephen, I knew he felt the same, and we started trying again as soon as we could.' Within . two months, Mrs Schollick found out that she was expecting again, but . at a scan she found out the baby had stopped growing and died. In early 2010 Mr and Mrs Schollick learned they were expecting a baby. Their daughter, Amelia, was stillborn on December 29, 2010. In February 2011 Mrs Schollick became pregnant again but she miscarried. Within three months of the miscarriage, she conceived again. The baby died six weeks into the pregnancy. In July 2011 the triplets were conceived during the couple's honeymoon. They were born on January 29, 2012. The couple were desperate for another baby, but three months later, they were apprehensive when Mrs Schollick became pregnant again. Their fears were realised, when she suffered a second miscarriage at six weeks. ‘After everything we had been through I couldn't cope with anything more,’ said Mrs Schollick. ‘We decided to stop trying and just leave it to fate. If it was meant to happen it would happen.’ In the summer of 2011, the family decided to go on holiday to Cornwall, where, unknown to their family and friends, they decided to get married. During their honeymoon, Mrs Schollick conceived again. Because of the earlier problems, the couple wasted no time in visiting the hospital for a scan. ‘It was the same nurse that had told me Amelia had died,’ said Mrs Schollick. ‘Running the scanner over my stomach, she turned to me and said, “I don't know how to tell you this”, and I just thought, “oh no, not again,” but then she announced, “it's twins”. ‘But I just couldn't get excited, if anything I was more scared. I thought I was going to lose another two babies.’ Mrs Schollick was in for a further shock. When she attended the second scan, she was told she was not expecting two babies, but three. ‘When the nurse first said I was having triplets I thought she was winding me up. ‘I sat in the car park for half an hour after the scan and just cried my eyes out. I was so scared.' Mrs Schollick was too fearful to get excited, with the previous miscarriages never far from her mind. ‘I was just going through the motions,’ she said. ‘I didn't buy anything for the babies - I didn't want to tempt fate.’ The triplets were born nine weeks early but all are now healthy one-year-olds and Mrs Schollick says that the family is now complete . The situation was put into perspective, however, when medics explained the high risk of miscarriage with triplets. Having lost three babies in a row, Mrs Schollick was quick to decline the offer of reducing the number of foetuses she was carrying in order to give the remaining ones a stronger chance of survival. She said: ‘You can't pick and choose, can you? I just realised that whatever was meant to be, would be.’ The couple had previously found out they were expecting three boys and chose the names, Aidan, Alfie and Andrew. ‘I wanted a natural delivery, but they said no because Alfie's cord was a lot thinner than it should have been, but as it was, he came out naturally and quickly,’ said Mrs Schollick. ‘They were already performing the caesarean section, so the other two were born that way.’ They were born on January 29 last year, nine weeks early. Alfie was the smallest at 2llb 2oz, his identical twin, Andrew, was 3lb 3oz and Aidan was 3lb 6oz. After a rocky start due to their small size, the triplets are now happy one-year-olds, with very different personalities. ‘Aidan's the softy,’ said Mrs Schollick. ‘He loves his cuddles. ‘Andrew is quite cheeky. He's the nosy one, if anyone comes in the house he's first to investigate. ‘Alfie is the strong one. He never gives up on anything. ‘It's hectic sometimes and six kids might seem like a lot to some, but this mad house is the only place I'd want to be. ‘I'll never forget Amelia and our other babies, but finally our family is complete.’","Gemma Schollick gave birth to Alfie, Andrew and Aidan nine weeks early .

A federal appeals court has denied bail for a New York City police officer charged with conspiring to rape, kill and eat women after a prosecutor described how the suspect was allegedly salivating over the prospect of cooking a female friend. 'My mouth was watering the whole time,' Gilberto Valle allegedly told a friend on an online forum after he had lunch in Baltimore with a former college pal. The disgraced NYPD cop later fantasized about slow-cooking and eating the woman, Assistant U.S. Attorney Hadassa Waxman said in court Tuesday. NYPD Officer Michael Van Hise (left) and 'Cannibal Cop' Gilberto Valle (right) were partners. Van Hise has been charged with conspiracy to kidnap and planning crimes against children of his own family . In online transcripts cited by NBC4 Valle at one . point tells a co-conspirator that his oven is 'big enough to fit one of . these girls if I folded their legs.' 'I was thinking of tying her body . onto some kind of apparatus...cook her over a low heat, keep her alive . as long as possible,' he is accused of saying in the July conversation. Also on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge . Paul Gardephe delayed the trial date. Now, jury selection will get under . way February 11, with opening statements beginning on February 25. Originally, the trial was scheduled . for next Tuesday, but Valle's lawyers said they need extra time to prepare . because being in prison has made it difficult for Valle to review nearly . a million pages of evidence. Defense attorney Julia Gatto said . authorities had arranged for him to look at evidence on a computer . during the day but he must be handcuffed while doing so. He has been imprisoned since he was . charged last fall with using a law enforcement database between last . January and October 24 as he made plans to kidnap, rape, kill and eat . women while communicating with others on a website devoted to the . exploration of deviant sexual fantasies. Defense lawyers have said all along he was engaging in sexual fantasies and intended no violence. Last week, a 22-year-old Trenton, New . Jersey, man Michael Van Hise, was charged in the case. He was accused of . trying to hire Valle to kidnap a Manhattan woman that he could rape and . kill. He, like Valle, has pleaded not . guilty to conspiracy. Van Hise’s lawyer has said her client never . intended to harm anyone and made that clear to investigators with whom . he cooperated for several months before his arrest. Gruesome: Defense lawyers failed to convince a federal appeals court that NYPD officer Gilberto Valle, right, should be free on bail after a prosecutor said how the suspect had allegedly described his mouth watering after meeting an old friend for lunch . During Tuesday’s appeals arguments, . defense attorney Edward Zas said Valle was just like 40,000 other people . who go online to 'engage in the most heinous depraved chats but they . are imaginary.' Circuit Judge Chester J. Straub . questioned how the defense could argue that the case was built solely on . fantasies when there was evidence that Valle and others used real . names, engaged in surveillance and discussed how much money would be . charged to kidnap a woman. Zas said aspects of the government’s . case were already crumbling, including its claim that he went to . Maryland to conduct surveillance on a woman, who now says she knew the . police officer and there was nothing unusual about his visit. Zas called the prosecution misguided and predicted Valle would be exonerated. 'He’s done nothing except imagine bad . things and put them foolishly on the Internet in a very bad way,' Zas . said. 'If there is just role playing...there is no crime at all. The . only crime is in Mr. Valle’s imagination.' The prosecutor the court that the . government had inadvertently mischaracterized the purpose of Valle’s . visit with the woman in Maryland but added that there was plenty of . other evidence that went beyond fantasy. She said, for instance, that Valle . had accessed the recipe for chloroform and sent it to a co-conspirator . and had an operating plan for kidnapping and cooking women. Waxman said Valle had created plots . that were a 'depraved, disgusting, troubling, gruesome' blueprint for . kidnappings, and she noted that his wife had insisted on removing their . daughter from their home. 'He risked his job, his marriage, his child and his freedom to engage in these acts,' she said.

Prosecutors in the case of the New York City police officer charged with conspiring to rape, kill and eat women want jurors in the upcoming February trial to learn about the explicit online chats in which he detailed his cannibal desires. According to court papers 'Cannibal cop' Gilberto Valle, was told by an online friend by the name of 'Moody Blues' that human flesh 'isn't quite like pork, but very meaty anyway' and that he'd previously eaten a 'black woman and a white child.' The disgraced NYPD officer - who has claimed he hasn't ever eaten anyone before - replied 'Excellent', reveal records at the Manhattan federal court released today. Prosecutors in the trial of Gilberto Valle want the jury to hear how he openly discussed cannibalism and the taste of human flesh through online chat rooms . Valle, 28, is charged with plotting to kidnap, torture, cook and eat at least 100 women and prosecutors also want jurors in his trial to hear of this online exchange between 'Moody Blues', who is based abroad and Valle. 'If we get someone..and we finish the meat early, would you go for another?' wrote 'Moody Blues'. 'Yeah. I think we would have to give it time though,' replies Valle. 'Why? Go for a completely different type. I'd love to eat another child,' countered 'Moody Blues.' In addition to the gruesome messaging, court papers note that 'Moody Blues' wrote to Valle that 'I also love roasting whole pelvises, mind you only did with the little one so far.' Prosecutors revealed the chilling messages in response to Valle's legal team and their attempts to bar introduction of evidence 'in which Moody Blues appears to recount times in his past he has cannabilized children.' Gilberto and his estranged wife Kathleen Cooke Mangan, 28. It was Kathleen's discoveries on Valle's computer that led FBI agents to her husband . Valle's defense team has said that 'Moody Blues''hyperbolic and twisted recanting of prior instances of cannibalization are either irrelevant, exceedingly prejudicial, or both,' and are 'only unrelated claims of Moody Blues' repugnant prior acts. 'Mr. Valle never engages in the conversation on this subject with Moody Blues other than to usher the conversation away from the matter and into sexual fantasies about Which Mr. Valle finds arousing -- all of which have to do with adults,' public defenders Julia Gatto and Christopher Flood wrote. However, federal prosecutors have insisted in court that the exchanges are not 'unfairly prejudicial' and are 'highly probabtive of Valle's state of mind and of the existence of an actual, and non-fantastical agreement between Valle and the co-conspirator to commit a kidnapping.' 'Indeed , they are no more sensational, depraved and disturbing than the related portions of the conversations (which Valle concedes are admissible) about shoving a specific and identified woman into an oven, with her legs folded under her, or cooking her over an open fire, slowly, to prolong her suffering,' prosecutors Hadassa Waxman and Randall Jackson wrote. Prosecutors also made the point that Valle as a police officer, 'charged with knowing, and enforcing, the law', was 'voluntarily communicating with an individual who claimed to have murdered and eaten a child, and who desired to commit other murders with Valle.' Valle who will go on trial next month is accused of scheming online with at least three people to adduct, rape, torture, cook and eat women he targeted using a police database.

Guardsman Watson explained that as part of the 1st Battalion Scots Guards he was based at Balmoral, the Queen’s estate in Scotland, for three months. He said: ‘I used to speak to her every day. She used to come and say “How are you?” I even danced arm-in-arm with her at the Ghillies’ Ball. ‘She comes around every day to see what’s going on and so does Prince Philip.’ The Queen enjoys Scottish country dancing and hosts dances known  as Ghillies’ Balls for neighbours, estate staff and members of the community.

A judge has chastised himself for not doing ‘his public duty’ after sparing a burglar jail – only for the thief to break into another house just 11 days later. Judge Scott Wolstenholme bemoaned his own ‘foolishly optimistic’ decision to give Steffan Jackson, 18, who had burgled his father’s home, a final chance. The teenager, whose own mother has had to call the police about him in the past, was given a community order. Judge Scott Wolstenholme, left, criticised himself for being 'foolishly optimistic' after prolific teenage criminal Steffan Jackson, right, broke into an elderly man's home 11 days after he gave him another chance . But less than two weeks later he burgled another house, this time belonging to an 87-year-old man. It is not the first time that Judge . Wolstenholme’s ‘lenient’ sentencing has caused controversy. One man . spared jail for a stabbing went on to murder four people. Yesterday the judge admitted Jackson’s second victim had suffered directly because of his decision. ‘I was optimistic and, as it turns out, foolishly optimistic,’ he said. ‘Because of my optimism I am afraid . [the victim] has suffered a huge loss which he wouldn’t have had I have . been doing my public duty last time.’ He has now sent Jackson to a young . offenders’ institution for four years after Leeds Crown Court heard how . his elderly victim now felt anxious and afraid living on his own. Last night, Jackson’s mother said she felt for the victim. Teresa McDarby, 52, said: ‘Steffan had . a lot of court appearances and that was the first time he was given a . chance – but he messed it up. ‘I’m not going to defend my kids if . they do wrong, and I do feel for the victim. Steffan is no angel. I . agreed with the judge when he gave him that chance. However, he blew . it.’ Jackson targeted the elderly man’s . house in Leeds early on April 1 this year. He was subject to a curfew . after being given a 12-month community order for the previous burglary. The court heard the teenager, who has . been committing offences since he was 11, smashed a window to get in and . stole more than £1,000 in cash. He was caught by police after he cut himself and left blood at the scene, later pleading guilty to burglary. The judge said he had not been doing his public duty when he had seen Jackson at Leeds Crown Court earlier . A statement read to the court on the . victim’s behalf said: ‘I find it terrible somebody could come into my . home and steal [my money] and spend it because I worked hard in my . younger days to save. I am sure it will take a long time to feel 100 per . cent safe again. If ever I do.’  John Bachelor, mitigating, said many . of Jackson’s offences were linked to drug abuse. Jackson has been in trouble with the . police from an early age and boasts on his Bebo page he likes to ‘smoke, . drink and have fun’. He also uploaded a picture of himself to Facebook . brandishing a sword. When he was just ten, he featured in . the BBC3 series Honey We’re Killing The Kids, saying he had been smoking . since the age of four. His mother, who herself smoked 60 a day, blamed . her son’s five-a-day habit on peer pressure. The show revealed he and sister . Shannon, now 19, had problems since their father walked out, lacking . discipline and gorging on fast food. His mother said Steffan was the . youngest of her five children and she had called the police about him in . the past after he kept emptying the TV meter. Judge Wolstenholme attracted . controversy in 2010 when he told two women who ran a brothel which raked . in almost £500,000 that it was a ‘model’ for how such a business should . be run if it were ever legal. In 2005, he was criticised over his . ‘lenient’ sentencing of murderer Mark Hobson, who was spared jail for . stabbing a man and went on to kill his girlfriend Claire Sanderson her . twin sister, Diane, and an elderly couple James and Joan Britton. The Brittons’ daughter, Catherine . Wilkins, said her parents might be alive if Hobson had been jailed . instead of being given a community service and a probation order.","Judge said latest victim suffered because he had not done 'his public duty'

A female Air Force instructor who had sex with a male trainee was sentenced to three months in jail on Thursday. Staff Sgt. Emily Allen was also given 30 days' hard labor and demoted to airman first class. She is the first woman to be tried in the ongoing sex scandal swamping Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas. Allen pleaded guilty to having sex in 2011 with a trainee airman, seeking to have a liaison with a second airman she met in basic training and having unprofessional social relationships with a pair of female airmen. U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant Emily Allen (center) broke down in court when her father took the stand and said his daughter had 'always been a good kid' 'She pleaded guilty to having a relationships with all four of the technical school Airmen,' Lackland spokesman Brent Boller said. Technical training is the course immediately after basic training where new Air Force recruits learn the skills needed to enter their military work assignment. It is a violation of military law for Military Training Instructors to have any kind of personal relationship with trainees under their command. Prosecutors sought harsh punishment, including six months in jail for Allen. They painted a picture of an officer out of control, who abused her position of power. Staff Sgt. Emily Allen, not pictured, is the first woman to be tried in the ongoing sex scandal swamping Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas . One airman told the court how Allen pursued him, calling him on a dormitory intercom, arranging a laundry room encounter and, finally, meeting with him three times during a technical training course. 'She asked if I wanted to have sex and I said, ""No, I didn't have a condom,'"" he told the court, reports MySanAntonio.com. Allen, the single mother of a seven-year-old girl, has blamed her downfall on feelings of insecurity. She also broke down in court when her father took the stand and said his daughter had ‘always been a good kid.’ The Air Force could yet move to discharge her after her release from jail. Chief Master Sgt. Kathleen Bruckner, command chief master sergeant, Air Force Reserve Command, addresses the enlisted Airmen of the 433rd Airlift Wing, Lackland Air Force Base . More than two dozen Air Force training sergeants have been investigated at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland for engaging in improper sexual activities, from flirting to rape, with both male and female recruits. Some 62 current and former Air Force members have come forward to claim they were victims of abuse while undergoing training at Lackland. The scandal has prompted some members of Congress to criticize the Pentagon and hold hearings on what they said was a failure of top military leaders to deal with a culture of sexual harassment and abuse. Allen is the 18th Air Force instructor to face court martial in what has become the largest sex scandal in the U.S. military in nearly 20 years.

Picard, who lost his arms in a work accident, planned to start a charity ride June 8—to stretch from Ft. Lauderdale to Spokane, Washington—called Hands for Baby Jameson. However, crooks put those plans on hold when they broke into Picard’s van and made off with his specially designed bike. ‘They were able to pull the bike that was strapped inside the car out through the back and dump stuff on the floor right over my prosthetic arms,’ Picard said.

Lord Justice Leveson was accused of a ‘contemptuous’ refusal to answer ‘legitimate questions’ after insisting he would make no further comments on an affair between a counsel to his inquiry and a barrister representing celebrities. The judge reacted with irritation to a letter from Tory MP Rob Wilson requesting further information about the relationship between Carine Patry Hoskins and David Sherborne. Mr Wilson, a parliamentary aide to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, is calling for a full investigation by the Bar Standards Board, as a professional code of conduct suggests affairs between opposing lawyers should be avoided lest the perception be created of ‘a danger of a breach of confidence or other conspiracy’. Questions have been raised about whether the affair between Carine Patry Hoskins and David Sherborne tainted the findings of the Leveson report . Mr Sherborne, who represented actor Hugh Grant and other celebrity victims of phone hacking, went on holiday to the romantic Greek island of Santorini with Ms Patry Hoskins, a married mother of two, in August last year. The visit took place while the inquiry was being conducted, although the couple claim they simply discussed the ‘possibility of a future relationship and decided against it’. Parliamentary aide Rob Wilson described Lord Leveson's dismissal of his request for information as 'contemptuous' They say they changed their minds later and became a couple after the inquiry ended in November. In . a letter to Mr Wilson yesterday, Lord Justice Leveson flatly rejected . any suggestion that his report into Press standards may have been . tainted by the relationship. The judge insisted that ‘every finding of fact, every conclusion and every recommendation’ in last year’s report was his alone and that Ms Patry Hoskins had no influence over them. ‘You ask whether it is possible that [Ms Patry Hoskins] may have had an input into the inquiry’s conclusions... the answer is “no”,’ he wrote. ‘Ms Patry Hoskins was second junior counsel to my inquiry and, throughout the process, undertook all of her work at the request and under the direction of either myself or Robert Jay QC... ‘As for her impact, I repeat from my report: ... every finding of fact, every conclusion and every recommendation is mine alone.’ Lord Justice Leveson added: ‘I am aware that you have written to the Bar Standards Board and it will be for the board, not me, to determine whether there has been any breach of the code of conduct. ‘In the meantime, I see no benefit in engaging in further public debate about the work of the inquiry or  the integrity of its processes: I do not intend to comment on this matter further.’ Standing firm: Lord Justice Leveson said he plans to make no further comment on the matter . Mr Wilson said Lord Justice Leveson had ‘contemptuously dismissed’ proper questions. He said: ‘Lord Justice Leveson’s response is highly unsatisfactory. In the past, the courts have rightly shown great humility and taken any perception of a conflict of interest or breach of confidence very seriously indeed. ‘Whole cases have been quashed where people assisting a judge are perceived to have a conflict of interest. Instead, Lord Justice Leveson has contemptuously dismissed perfectly legitimate questions about what work his counsel was doing, what access she might have had to confidential information, and what the nature of her relationship with Hacked Off’s barrister was during this time. ‘Leaving these questions unanswered doesn’t do the Leveson Inquiry or the legal profession any good. ‘I am frankly baffled as to why Leveson has acted in this way.’ Lord Justice Leveson was criticised after declining to take any questions from the media as he announced his findings last year.","Lord Leveson refuses to answer 'legitimate questions' about relationship between Carine Patry Hoskins and David Sherborne .

Half of people would vote to stay in the European Union if David Cameron succeeds in negotiating a new relationship, a survey revealed on the eve of the Prime Minister’s long-awaited speech on Europe. Support for leaving the EU altogether is at its lowest level since December 2011, with 42 per cent of people saying they would vote to exit in a straight in/out referendum. With Mr Cameron vowing to press ahead with his landmark speech in Amsterdam tomorrow morning, he will bolstered by the findings which show 50 per cent of people would vote to stay in the EU if he renegotiated the UK’s relationship with Europe and said that Britain's interests were now protected. David Cameron, who will deliver his long-awaited speech in Amsterdam tomorrow, will be bolstered by the dwindling public support to leave the EU together . The PM tonight briefed US President Barack Obama on the content of the speech in an attempt to reassure the White House, after warnings from the administration that referendums could turn countries ‘inward’. He also spoke to French President Francois Hollande today, after briefing Dutch PM Mark Rutte and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the weekend. The PM’s official spokesman said: ‘There’s a debate in Europe across the European Union, significantly driven by the events in the Eurozone. There is a debate in Britain as well. The Prime Minister wants to play a leading part in that debate, changing the relationship with the EU and then seeking consent. ‘In all the calls that the Prime Minister has been make there is an acknowledgment that there is this debate going on throughout the European Union.’ Mr Cameron is expected to use the speech, first mooted in July last year, to set out a raft of powers he wants to claw back from Brussels. Mr Cameron tonight spoke to US President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande to brief them on this speech in the hope of avoiding a diplomatic row tomorrow . He will argue that major change in the EU, with Eurozone countries moving closer together, presents an opportunity for Britain to seek concessions. If he secures a better deal for Britain, he would hold a referendum and urge the public to support continued membership of the EU based on the ‘fresh settlement’. But today Business Secretary Vince Cable warned there was a risk that Mr Cameron could end up taking Britain out of the EU 'by accident'. 'Once you talk about renegotiation you are opening up the possibility that if you don't get what you want, you leave - by accident or design,' he told BBC Radio 4's The World At One. In a new YouGov poll published today, people were asked to ‘imagine if David Cameron renegotiated the UK’s relationship with Europe and said that Britain's interests were now protected, and recommended that Britain remain a member of the European Union on new terms’. Among respondents 50 per cent said they would vote to stay in the EU, while only 25 per cent said they would still vote to leave. Five per cent would not vote and 20 per cent were unsure. Asked how they would vote in a straight in/out referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU, 42 per cent said they would vote to leave, down from a high of 51 per cent in November and the lowest level since dropping to 41 per cent in December 2011. Some 36 per cent now say they would vote to stay in the EU, up from 28 per cent in October. The rest are either unsure or wouldn’t vote. Mr Cameron spoke to Dutch PM Mark Rutte and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the weekend . Joe Twyman, YouGov director of political and social research, said: 'The key finding from all YouGov’s recent polls is that when it comes to our relationship with Europe, the British electorate does not support the status quo. 'What most people want is for Britain to stay part of the EU, but on what they regard as more favourable, renegotiated terms.' Mr Cameron is under pressure from all sides, with Eurosceptic Tory MPs and the resurgent UK Independence Party demanding a tougher line towards exiting the EU. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats and Labour are warning that raising the prospect of withdrawal but delaying a referendum until 2018 will damage business confidence in investing in Britain.

Her entry into the Rancho Mirage, California clinic comes after she is said to have rehired her previous lawyer Shawn Holley, who negotiated with Santa Monica City Attorney Terry White to approve the Betty Ford Center as an acceptable rehab alternative. Lohan was scheduled to start rehab on Thursday morning to begin her 90 days of court-ordered treatment. Finally checked in: Lindsay Lohan entered the Betty Ford Center rehab facility on Thursday night after rehiring former lawyer Shawn Holley in desperate bid to avoid arrest . Acceptable: The facility in Rancho Mirage, California was deemed 'acceptable' by the court late Thursday night . But the troubled starlet was reported to . been 'spooked' by the amount of paparazzi waiting outside the . Morningside Recovery in Newport Beach, and refused to check into the . facility. Lohan was said to have then 'begged' Holley to return as her lawyer after prosecutors said they would seek an arrest warrant if the star was not back in rehab by sunrise on Friday, reported TMZ. Lohan was allegedly unimpressed with the way lawyer Mark Heller . had handled her case, and spent the better part of Thursday convincing . Holley to return after she sensationally fired her last year. 'Lindsay cannot stand [Heller] and thinks he doesn’t know what he is doing,' a source told RadarOnline.com. 'So late Thursday, from hiding, she began calling and emailing Shawn incessantly. Mixing things up: Lindsay is reportedly unhappy . with her lawyer Mark Heller's progress with the case, and has hired back . her former lawyer Shawn Holley . 'Shawn has always had a soft spot for . Lindsay, even after everything she has pulled. She hates to see her . suffering,' added the source. Holley was able to broker a last . minute deal with the D.A. to approve the Betty Ford Center, where . Lindsay famously fought with staffer during another rehab stay in 2010. Lindsay's father Michael confirmed that she had finally entered a facility, although he didn't confirm which one. Santa Monica Chief Deputy City Attorney Terry White said he has received confirmation that Lohan has checked in to a rehab facility and he is satisfied with her location. Russ Patrick, a spokesman for Betty Ford, said he could not confirm Lohan had returned to the facility, which is a licensed treatment hospital founded in 1982 and has treated numerous celebrities. Familiar surrounds: Lindsay spent time at Betty Ford in 2010, where she famously got into a fight with a staffer . Not bad: The center features a sparkling blue pool where patients can take daily water aerobics classes . Comfortable: A typical room is set up for double occupancy and includes a private patio . Health is paramount: Patients choose from two hot entrees, a variety of deli sandwiches, along with a soup du jour and salad bar, according to the center's website . 'I can’t say where she is. She did check into a rehab. I’m really happy she’s in a rehab,' Michael told The New York Post on Friday. He said Lindsay sent him a text message on Thursday night to say she was in rehab, but that she would rather be at a more upmarket facility. 'Yes, daddy I’m OK, just annoyed by this happening,' he said she wrote. 'I really want to go to treatment and, of course, something has to go wrong...I want to go to Hawaii or Antigua.'

The news comes after the star decided not to enter her court-ordered rehab treatment on Thursday morning.

Could face arrest: Lindsay’s failure to check in to the facility is likely a violation of her recent plea deal . RadarOnline, however, reports that Lohan did in fact walk through the doors of the facility, but left just a few minutes later. 'She told people there that she didn't need rehab,' a source told Radar. 'And then she left. Everyone was stunned.' Lohan's father Michael also confirmed to Radar that his daughter never checked in. 'I have no other choice than to get this out there to help Lindsay,' he said. Backing out: An image has been released which appears to show Lindsay and her luggage arriving at the facility . Retail therapy: At 8.45am, 15 minutes after she was due to check into her rehab facility, Lindsay was seen shopping at Fry's electronics store . Lindsay was spotted at a Fry's Electronics store . in Fountain Valley at 8.45am, while at the same time her Heller was in court asserting she had already checked into rehab. After refusing to check into . Morningside, Lindsay allegedly insisted on being taken back to the . airport because she wanted to fly to New York. 'She was saying, ""I'm not going to rehab. I'm not going to rehab. Take me back to the airport,""' a source told The New York Daily News. Orange County's finest: Police were seen surrounding Morningside as Lindsay checked in . 'If . there’s credible confirmation she’s heading back to New York, then I’m . going to have to go in and ask the court to issue a warrant,” Santa . Monica City Attorney Terry White said on Thursday. And the actress' father Michael told Radar: 'If . that’s the case I have been told that she will be arrested in New York . and her bail will be set at $100,000.' Michael also told the Daily News that . he had spoken to Lindsay before the flight to New York took off, . pleading with her not to get on it. 'She said, ""Daddy, how can they arrest me?"" I got her just before she left,' said Michael. Staying put: The Liz & Dick star will stay in the California facility until a decision has been made by the court . Final moments of freedom: On Wednesday Lindsay spent her last day before rehab shopping and chain-smoking . As well as telling the judge that . Lindsay had already checked into rehab, Heller also had to plead with . the judge to get the okay that Morningside would be a suitable facility . for the actress to complete her treatment in. Lindsay had originally been scheduled . to complete her 90-day treatment at the Seafield rehabilitation . facility in New York after pleading no contest to charges of lying to police about driving . during a car crash last June, but Michael appeared to have put the actress off . the rehab centre. 'I . told her it’s like a motel, and you share a room and have a plastic . shower curtain. You can’t smoke, you can’t leave the property. She said, . “What?!’” he told The New York Daily News. Revoked: The Newport Beach rehab centre allegedly can only act as a sober living facility and treat outpatients . Going to a different centre unapproved by the court technically broke her plea agreement, meaning the . star’s attorney was required to appear before a judge. On Thursday morning, Heller was attempting to convince Judge James R Dabney . to approve of the switch. He argued that as Lindsay has already . entered and is ‘ensconced’ in the program, it could affect her recovery should she have to move facilities. Lindsay's living quarters: The rehab facility features quaint interiors, as this photograph reveals . In and out: Lindsay allegedly left the plush rehab facility after 'a few minutes' ‘She's . going to be meeting with a psychiatrist later today,’ Heller explained, . reinforcing that the star is ‘commencing immediate treatment.' The . news came amid claims that the centre in fact does not even have a . licence to offer residential treatment as it was revoked in May 2012. According . to TMZ, Morningside had their licence suspended after they were found . to be careless with prescription drugs and went beyond the constraints . of the licence. Starting off on the right foot: Heller claims that Lindsay will be meeting with a psychiatrist later in the day . Looking out for Lindsay: Mark told Judge James R. Dabney that it would be a bad idea to move his client already . But . Morningside Recovery released a statement on Thursday claiming the . facility does in fact have a licence to provide drug and alcohol . treatment. The facility's . CEO Mary Helen Beatificato said the 2011 revocation of Morningside's . licence only hinders the centre's ability to provide detox services to . residents. The . judge however didn’t seem to have too many qualms about the switch to . that particular facility, despite the fact that it was not on a list . of six centres approved by the court. Convincing: Lindsay chose a rehab centre which was not approved by the court so Mark was attempting to get the judge to OK the decision . Fighting his corner: The switch to a different rehab technically violates Lindsay's plea agreement and now the centre must be approved . '90 days and 270 looks': Lindsay posted a picture of herself packing for her stay in rehab on Instagram on Tuesday night . The judge later stated that Lindsay will not have to appear in court as the case continues 'as long as she is in compliance'.

Authorities cracked a crime ring that saw more $1million in rat and small mammal meat sold as mutton, in a food safety crackdown that coincides with a bird flu outbreak that has sent poultry sales plummeting in China. One vendor was found to be using additives to spice up and sell rat, fox and mink meat as fake lamb rolls at markets in Shanghai that are frequented by tourists. Rodents: Tourists who bought what they thought was mutton from markets in Shanghai may actually have been sold rat meat . Crackdown: Authorities in China found instances of rat, fox and mink meat being passed off as mutton (file photo) 'After adding gelatine, carmine, . nitrate and other substances, he sold the meat as fake lamb rolls [for . hot pot] at farmers' markets in Jiangsu and Shanghai', authorities said of the suspect, who has the surname Wei. Wei's organisation was raided in Jiangsu and Shanghai in February, which . led to the arrest of 63 suspects and the seizure of 10 tons of meat and . additives. The operations sales since 2009 are estimated to add up to more than 10million yuan ($1.6million). Authorities have arrested 904 . suspects since the end of January for selling and producing fake or . tainted meat products, the Ministry of Public Security said in a . statement posted on its website on Thursday. Despite persistent efforts by police, 'food safety crimes are still prominent, and new situations are emerging with new characteristics', the ministry's statement said, citing 'responsible officials'. Police confiscated more than 20,000 tonnes of fake or inferior meat products after breaking up illegal food plants during the nationwide operation, the ministry said. Altogether there were '382 cases of water-injected meat, fake mutton and beef, diseased meat, toxic and harmful meat products', the statement said. As well as rat and fox meat being passed off as mutton, inspectors found evidence of other vendors in southwestern Guizhou province mixing hydrogen peroxide solution with chicken claws, according to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald. Food safety and environmental pollution are chronic problems in China and public anxiety over cases of fake or toxic food often spreads quickly. In April, many consumers lost their appetite for poultry as an outbreak of the H7N9 bird flu virus spread in China. 'Everything we eat is poison': News of the latest scandal to hit China coincides with an outbreak of bird flu that has sent poultry sales plummeting . Sales dropped by 80 percent in eastern China, where the bird flu has been most prevalent, although experts stress that cooked chicken is perfectly safe. In March, more than 16,000 rotting pigs were found floating in one of Shanghai's main water sources, triggering a public outcry. Over-crowding at pig farms was likely behind the die-off and their disposal in the Huangpu river. The public security ministry said police had confiscated more than 15 tonnes of tainted pork in Anhui province, although as much as 60 tonnes had been sold in Anhui and Fujian provinces since mid-2012. But it was the rodent meat in particular that people couldn't stomach, with Internet users turning to the popular microblogging site Sina Weibo to vent their outrage. 'Rats? How disgusting. Everything we eat is poison,' one user wrote. 'We are nearly immune to hundreds of poisons, should we thank these fantastic businessmen?' another said.","More than 900 arrested on suspicion of selling fake or tainted meat products .

The wife of a sheriff deputy has given graphic testimony alleging he tortured and sexually assaulted her and her new partner in a vicious two-hour attack. The woman was married to defendant Robert McClain, a former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, and pretended to castrate her 23-year-old boyfriend as the husband watched, prosecutors previously said. As she took to the stand, the unidentified woman was visibly distressed as she told jurors McClain, 38, from Irvine, California, slashed her boyfriend repeatedly, beating him to the point of brain damage. Scroll down for video . Insanity plea: Robert McClain is accused of beating, torturing and sexually assaulting his wife and her boyfriend when he found out about their affair . She told how she begged her husband of 12 years to stop the attack for the sake of their children, but he continued and tried to have sex with her, forced her to have sex with the badly . injured boyfriend and ordered the castration. Authorities say the confrontation took place at a leasing office in Irvine where McClain's wife worked. The wife, who was 31 at the time of the attack had just asked for a divorce, prosecutors said. The 12-year marriage of McClain and his wife was crumbling, and she became involved with a 23-year-old man for about four months, Orange County Deputy District Attorney John Christl told jurors. McClain eventually found out and persuaded his wife to let him meet his romantic rival — a musician who had moved to California to audition for American Idol. Injured: The wife's boyfriend suffered brain damage and needed four months of rehabilitation to learn how to walk and talk - his face is obstructed for legal reasons . The woman testified she did not realise her husband was planning an attack when he asked to . meet her boyfriend in person one night in December, 2008. 'All I am gonna do is shake his hand,' she said he told her, according to the Register. But the break room became a makeshift torture chamber, with McClain using two . guns and a knife he had brought to the meeting, Christl said. Attack: Authorities say the confrontation took place at a leasing office, pictured, in Irvine where McClain's wife worked and her boyfriend lived . The pair were quickly overpowered, and forced to undress at knifepoint, . prosecutors previously said. 'I am gonna do at least 15 years in jail for this,' she quoted her former husband as saying, the Register reported. 'I am gonna get it while I can' he reportedly said, referring to the sex demand. The . wife, whose voice quivered with emotion as she spoke, saying  McClain was relentless in attacking the much smaller, 145-pound boyfriend. Vicious: McClain, a sheriff deputy and former Marine, repeatedly struck the man with his fists, asking him how many times he slept with his wife, then took a knife and slashed the victim, according to the prosecution . 'Look at this white boy,' she quoted McClain as saying, according to the Register. 'You're cheating on me for this? This is what you're leaving me for?' She told her how boyfriend seemed to fade in and out of consciousness,  and screamed with pain as he was beaten. The woman told the court her boyfriend did not try and resist, but McClain beat and slashed her when she tried to shield her boyfriend of a few months. She said McClain gave her a gun and demanded she shoot either him or the boyfriend. She told the court, that her choice to aim the gun at him, after aiming it in a vague direction, further enraged McClain and he beat both of them with butt of the gun, the jury heard. McClain then forcibly sodomized the wife and used a knife to chop off her hair, before forcing her into a car, prosecutors said. The man was found hours later and had virtually every bone in his face broken, Christl said. He suffered brain damage and needed four months of rehabilitation to learn how to walk and talk. 'He couldn't remember what happened,' Christl said. 'He thought he was in a car accident.' McClain's defense attorney, Deputy Public Defender Darren Thompson, told the jury his client had no intention of hurting anyone but snapped when he saw his wife come to the aid of her lover. Thompson claimed his client's brain 'was on total shut down'. 'At some point he lost it,' Thompson said. 'He completely lost it.' If jurors find McClain guilty of crimes that include torture, kidnapping and sexual assault, the trial will enter a second phase when the jury must decide if he was legally sane on the night of September 28, 2008. McClain has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Wearing gray slacks, a striped shirt and a white skull cap, he looked at the graphic photos taken after the attacks but showed no response. Christl said investigators found bloodied clothing, a folding knife and guns that tied McClain to the crimes. McClain's wife was the first witness . called by the prosecution and she recounted her marriage with her former . husband, saying he was extremely jealous and she learned to walk with . her head down so she wouldn't meet eyes with another man. 'He said that he took marriage very . seriously,' she said as tears welled in her eyes. 'He said that if I . ever cheated on him I would be nubbed away because he would cut all my . limbs off.'","The woman was married to defendant Robert McClain, a former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy .

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 06:44 EST, 24 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:15 EST, 25 March 2013 . Scarce donor organs meant for NHS patients are being sold to wealthy foreigners for tens of  thousands of pounds. A leading hospital has confirmed that 19 private overseas patients bought donated livers in the past two years. Such organs are in short supply. Of the 550 NHS patients waiting for a liver, one in six is expected to die before they can get a transplant. Surgeons at King's College NHS Foundation Trust have carried out 19 operations in the past two year into patients from Greece, Cyprus, Kuwait, Libya and Dubai . But since 2011, King’s College Hospital in London has  given livers to patients from Greece, Cyprus, Kuwait, Libya and Dubai. The trust is likely to have been paid . around £1million for all the transplants, but it refused to disclose . how much it received for them individually. Although experts have condoned the . practice as ‘morally wrong’, it is not illegal because the Government . does not believe it prevents NHS patients from having transplants. Derek Manas, a consultant transplant surgeon at Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and also a member of the liver advisory panel said the private transplants were wrong . The Department of Health has refused . to implement a ban – ignoring the advice of a specially commissioned . taskforce – and claims organ donations are increasing. But senior doctors at other hospitals which do not sell organs privately say NHS patients must be given priority. Simon Bramhall, a consultant . transplant surgeon at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation . Trust, said: ‘There are not enough donors and too many NHS-entitled . recipients to give the organs away.’ Professor Derek Manas, who holds the . same position at Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘To say . “this liver is not usable for anyone in this country, I am going to . give it to someone from another country” – that is unacceptable.’ Gill McLachlan, a 46-year-old mother . from Bolton, suffers from a condition that causes her immune system to . attack her liver. She has been on a transplant waiting list since 2010. ‘Organs are a gift from some-body and it is the most fantastic gift,’ she said. ‘Private [transplants] should not be brought into it. ‘When you first get put on the list . you are told to pack a bag because it could be tonight. My bag has been . packed for two and a half years.’ Around 9,000 Britons need a transplant but a shortage of donors means that only 3,000 operations can be performed each year. Surgeons estimate that 18 per cent of . patients waiting for a replacement organ will die  before they receive . one. In 2009 the Department of Health commissioned the Organ Donations . Taskforce to review the practice of hospitals selling organs privately. It concluded that ‘financial gain from the transplant of donated organs feels morally wrong’ and recommended an outright ban. While patients from European . countries are entitled to donated organs on the NHS if they are a . suitable match, those from outside the continent are only allowed to buy . NHS organs if they are not wanted by patients in Britain. This is usually because doctors have decided the organs are too old or damaged to be of much benefit. But experts are concerned that doctors are ‘misjudging’ the quality, meaning very good organs are being sold abroad. At present, King’s College  Hospital is the only NHS trust which has admitted to selling organs. A spokesman for the trust said it complies with the ‘rules and . regulations relating to liver transplant surgery and the allocation of . organs’. A Department of Health spokesman said . having a transplant privately ‘in no way means getting an organ more . quickly’ and claimed there is ‘no evidence they stop NHS patients having . transplants or reduce public confidence in donating’.","King's College NHS Foundation Trust carried out 19 operations in 2 years .

"By . Craig Mackenzie . PUBLISHED: . 03:07 EST, 1 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:18 EST, 1 September 2012 . A German company that invented the birth defect pregnancy drug thalidomide has issued its first apology in 50 years to thousands of people born with disabilities. The Grunenthal Group said in a . statement today it 'regrets' the consequences of the drug . used to combat morning sickness which led to the birth of children without . limbs during the 1950s and 1960s. But a British charity which represents victims of the drug in the UK has rejected the apology as insufficient and demanded compensation. Victim: Phillipa Bradbourne, a baby born without arms after her mother took the morning sickness drug in 1963 . Freddie Astbury, head consultant of the Thalidomide Agency UK, said Grunenthal needed to 'put their money where their mouth is' rather than simply express regret. Mr Astbury, who was born in Chester in 1959 with no arms and no legs after his mother took the drug, said: 'It's a disgrace that it's taken them 50 years to apologise. 'If they are serious about admitting they are at fault and regret what happened they need to start helping those of us who were affected financially.' Grunenthal chief executive Harald Stock today said that the company had failed to reach out 'from person to person' to the victims and their mothers over the past 50 years. Display: A bronze statue by artist Bonifatius Stirnberg was unveiled yesterday in Stolberg, Germany, symbolizing a child born without limbs because of thalidomide . He issued his company's apology at . the unveiling of a bronze statue symbolising a child born without limbs . because of thalidomide  at the ceremony in the western German city . of Stolberg, where the firm is based. 1953: Drug created in Germany by the Gruenenthal Group. 1958: Thalidomide is first licensed for use in the UK. 1961: Australian doctor William McBride reports an increase in deformed babies being born at his hospital to mothers who had taken thalidomide. Drug is withdrawn later that year. 1968: UK manufacturers Distillers Biochemicals Limited (now Diageo) reaches compensation settlement following a legal battle by affected families. 2005: Diageo doubles its compensation payouts from £2.8m to about £6.5m a year. 2008: The drug is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma - bone marrow cancer - by the European Medicines Agency. 2009: UK government agrees a £20m grant, to be paid to the Thalidomide Trust over three years. 2010: Health minister Mike O'Brien makes a formal apology to thalidomide victims on behalf of the government/ . The . inscription reads: In Remembrance  of the Dead and Living of the . Contergan (the brand name thalidomide was sold under in Germany). Mr Stock said: 'We ask for forgiveness that for . nearly 50 years we didn't find a way of reaching out to you from human . being to human being. 'We ask that you regard our long silence as a sign of the shock that your fate caused in us. 'We wish that the thalidomide tragedy . had never happened. We see both the physical hardship and the emotional . stress that the affected, their families and particularly their . mothers, had to suffer because of thalidomide and still have to endure . day by day.' 'Instead, we have been silent and we . are very sorry for that.' By the time the drug was pulled from the market, more than 10,000 babies worldwide had been born with a range of disabilities caused by the drug. Many victims have only recently received compensation. Martin Johnson, director of the Thalidomide Trust, told the BBC that the company were still trying to perpetuate the myth that no-one could have known of the harm the drug could cause when there was, he said, much evidence that they did know. Mr Astbury believes Grunenthal are now apologising because of court proceedings brought by victims in Australia. He said: 'Being disabled is very expensive and Thalidomide people need help and care, and adaptations to their cars and homes. ""So we welcome the apology, but how far do they want to go? It's no good apologising if they won't open discussions on compensation. They've got to seriously consider financial compensation for these people. 'We just want people to live a comfortable life and that means Grunenthal have to pay for their mistake financially.' The Agency says there are 458 people currently in Britain affected by the drug, but that for every Thalidomide baby that lived there were 10 that died. In January 2010, the British Government expressed 'sincere regret' for the decision to give the drug the stamp of approval and set up a funding scheme to help survivors cope. Thalidomide was originally prescribed as a 'wonder drug' for morning sickness, headaches, coughs, insomnia and colds. Thalidomide babies often suffered missing or deformed limbs and extreme shortening of arms and legs, but the drug also caused malformations of the eyes and ears, genitals, heart, kidneys and digestive system. Scroll down to see Wendy and Lynette Row outside court . Bottles of thalidomide tablets . The Australian mother of thalidomide victim Lynette Rowe wept  today after hearing Grunenthal’s apology and branded it as 'insulting'. Standing next to her daughter, who settled a landmark legal case against the drug's British distributor in July, Wendy Rowe said the apology was 'the sort you give when you’re not really sorry'. She told the Australian newspaper: 'It’s also insulting that he wants us to believe Grunenthal had not apologised for 50 years because it has been in silent shock. 'I suspect he does not know what shock is. Shock is having your precious child born without arms and legs. It’s accepting that your child is not going to have that life that you wanted for her,. 'Shock is making sure that your other children don’t miss out on happiness and love and affection when you have a profoundly disabled child to look after. 'Our family couldn’t have gone into silent shock. We had to get up and face each day every day and cope with the incredible damage the Grunenthal had done to Lynne and our family.'

The mugshot of the Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev was released today giving proof that his violent streak started years before the fatal blasts. Tsarnaev was booked in 2009 for hitting his then-girlfriend following an argument about another woman, prompting assault and battery charges that were dismissed before trial. The mugshot photos come the day after it was announced that his body will be buried in Boston in spite of local outrage that his final resting place will be within the bounds of the city that he terrorized with pressure cooker bombs that killed three and injured more than 250 others. Criminal past: Tamerlan Tsarnaev was arrested for assault and battery in 2009 after slapping his girlfriend during an argument, though the charges were dismissed before going to trial . Tsarnaev's body was released to a local funeral home on Thursday after his family made arrangements to schedule a funeral. The hearse transporting his body was met with protesters throughout its journey, but funeral director Peter Stefan said that he was just doing his professional duty by making the arrangements. 'They can protest but again what do you do? In this country, you bury the dead. I can't control the circumstances of somebody's death or what they've done or how they died,' he told Fox News. The girlfriend: The blonde woman in this photo with Tamerlan was identified by The National Enquirer as being Nadine Ascencao, the woman who filed the charges against him . Mr Stefan added that all of the . cemeteries in the state of Massachusetts have refused to use one of . their plots for the terrorist, with the suggestion that a low-profile . nondescript headstone might be best. Tsarnaev's family also said that they . would be ordering a second autopsy as they do not trust the American . government rulings, fearing that his death during a gun battle with . police was part of a conspiracy. Medical examiners only ever release suspects bodies after they have determined the cause of death, but that verdict has not been publicly disclosed yet. Years before he allegedly opened fire on police alongside his younger brother Dzhokhar as they were on the run from authorities, the first apparent victim of his abuse was his girlfriend. Nadine Ascencao, 25, accused him of slapping her on July 28, 2009 during an argument over another woman - presumably Katherine Russell, whom he met at a club that year and went on to marry in 2010 - at his home in Cambridge. At around the time they were dating, Tsarnaev posed for a series of photos in a boxing ring, and Ms Ascencao was identified by the National Enquirer as being the blonde seen wrapping his gloves in one of the pictures. Ms Ascencao was 'crying hysterically' and called 911 to report that she was 'beat up by her boyfriend', Cambridge Police Officer Angela Pereira wrote in the arrest report. Doing his duty: Peter Stefan, the funeral director and owner of Graham, Putnam and Mahoney Funeral Parlors, said that he can't help what Tsarnaev did but 'in this country, we bury the dead' A vehicle believed to be carrying the body of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev backs into an underground garage at the Dyer-Lake Funeral Home . Outraged: Garrett Plath, right, holds a sign and Toni Zagami, left, wears a 'Boston Strong' shirt as they stand outside the Dyer-Lake Funeral Home . He admitted to slapping her and was arrested on charges of assault and battery, the complaint said. The charges were dismissed before trial. Around 11 months after the alleged slapping incident, Tsarnaev, 26, married his wife, Katherine Russell. Ms Russell is now the one gaining the attention of police as they are trying to determine what role, if any, she played in helping plan, execute or cover up the attacks on April 15. Though she was initially helpful, agreeing to be interviewed for hours and giving a DNA sample to test against a trace of female DNA found on one of the bombs, she has reportedly stopped cooperating with authorities. The New York Times cites federal sources who say that they are 'skeptical' about her prior claims to have had nothing to do with the bombings considering that she is not cooperating. Other relatives of the bomber confirmed that they would be arranging a funeral for the 26-year-old and that his body would remain in the U.S. and not be sent back to Russia. 'Of course, family members will take possession of the body,' his uncle Tsarni said. 'We'll do it. We will do it. A family is a family.' The move outraged Massachusetts residents, whose lives were terrorized for the week after the bombing as local, state and federal officials searched for Tamerlan and Dzhokhar. What is she hiding? Katherine Russell, the widow of Tamerlan, reportedly stopped cooperating with police . Fellow convictions: Both Tamerlan's wife Katherine Russell (left) and his mother Zubeidat K. Tsarnaeva (right) have prior shoplifting convictions, Russell's in 2007 and his mother's in 2012 . The only ones who have received some sliver of good news in the past few days were the relatives of the three victims who died in the blasts at the marathon finish line. A lawyer overseeing the fund dedicated to the victims announced that the families of the three who died could receive more than $1million in compensation. Not only that, each of the people who lost a limb in the attack could expect to receive close to $1million as well. The final number of people who lost a limb- some of whom lost more than one- has not been tallied but it could be upwards of 20 people.","Tamerlan Tsarnaev had a prior assault and battery charge years before he 'planned' the Boston Marathon bombing .

Elder brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed in a shootout with police, and Dzhokhar remains in a prison hospital after being badly wounded. 'I could just feel that he was being driven crazy by the unfairness that happened to us, that they killed our innocent Tamerlan,' their mother said, standing by the family's insistence that their children are innocent. The Tsarnaevs met the AP in their new apartment in a 14-story building in a well-to-do area of Makhachkala, the capital of the restive Caucasus province of Dagestan. The apartment had no furniture apart from a TV, a few rugs, and wallpaper materials lying on the floor. Anzor Tsarnaev, the suspects' father, . said they bought it for Tamerlan, his wife, and their young daughter in . the expectation that they would move to Makhachkala later this year. He . added that they planned to turn their old home in a dingy district on . the outskirts of town into a dentist's office, so that Dzhokhar, a . dental hygiene student, could work out of it after completing his . studies. 'Innocent:' Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, left, and husband Anzor Tsarnaev show videos on an iPad they say show their sons could not have been involved in last month's Boston Marathon bombings . 'All I can do is pray to God and hope that one day fairness will win out, our children will be cleared, and we will at least get Dzhokhar back, crippled, but at least alive,' Tsarnaev said. Separately, at a news conference in Moscow, the father of a 27-year-old mixed martial arts fighter who was killed during FBI questioning accused agents of being 'bandits' who executed his son. Abdul-Baki Todashev showed journalists 16 photographs that he said were of his son, Ibragim, in a Florida morgue. He said his son had six gunshot wounds to his torso and one to the back of his head and the pictures were taken by his son's friend, Khusen Taramov. It was not imediately possible to authenticate the photographs. The FBI says Todashev was being . questioned by an FBI agent and two Massachusetts state troopers about . his ties to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, as well as about a 2011 triple slaying in . Massachusetts. Three . law enforcement officials said initially that Ibragim Todashev had . lunged at the FBI agent with a knife, although two of them later said it . was no longer clear what had happened. The father said his son was '100 percent unarmed.' Meanwhile, the father of a Chechen immigrant killed in Florida while being interrogated by the FBI about his ties to the slain brother maintains that the U.S. agents killed his son 'execution-style . Taramov confirmed Thursday that he had taken some pictures of Ibragim Todashev's body at an Orlando funeral home and sent them to the father. He said Ibragim Todashev had a decorative sword with a broken handle, but that it was not a weapon. 'The sword wouldn't cut nothing,' Tamarov said. 'I played with it many times. It wasn't sharp from any angle. It would do the same harm as a piece of wood.' Killed: Ibragim Todashev, 27, was killed by federal authorities during questioning about his ties to the Boston Marathon bombing suspects . The father said Taramov told him that U.S. agents interrogated him on the street while five officials interrogated Todashev in his Florida house for eight hours on May 22, the night he was shot. Todashev's father said that his son moved to the U.S. in 2008 on a study exchange program and met Tsarnaev at a boxing gym in Boston in 2011, about a year before he moved to Orlando. He said the two were 'not particularly close friends.' Prior to last month's bombings, Todashev underwent an operation for a sports injury and was on crutches, making it physically impossible for him to have been involved in the bombings, his father said. He added that Todashev had recently received a green card and was planning to return to Chechnya for the summer last Friday, two days after he was killed. The father said he and his brother were . interviewed at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow on Thursday as they sought a . visa to take his son's body back to Chechnya. FBI agents interrogated the younger . Todashev twice before the night he was shot, his father said. He said . his son told him that he thought Tsarnaev had been set up to take the . blame for the bombings. 'I'd . only seen and heard things like that in the movies — they shoot . somebody and then a shot in the head to make sure,' Todashev said. 'These just aren't FBI agents, they're bandits,' he added. Tragedy: The April 15 bombings at the Boston Marathon killed three people and wounded more than 260 . The FBI wouldn't comment on the claims made by Todashev's father. The Tsarnaevs' parents have held fast to their belief that their sons were framed. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, dressed all in black and still visibly distressed, showed AP several YouTube videos on an iPad she claimed cleared her sons. They could not be authenticated by the AP. 'I remember when our cat was sick, Tamerlan was sick himself for two days afterward, because he was so worried about her,' Tsarnaeva said. She said Tamerlan told her about Todashev, and that she and her husband had invited him to visit them in Russia, though he never came. Tamerlan later told them that he and Todashev were unlikely to continue training together since they practiced different sports, and he appeared to have lost track of him after Todashev moved to Florida, Tsarnaeva added.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev spoke to his mother by phone and said he is struggling to understand what happened .

A rare German bomber from the Second World War is set to be raised from the English Channel where it has lain for seven decades, it was announced today. The retrieval of the last surviving Dornier Do 17 from the Goodwin Sands off the coast of Kent will be the biggest recovery of its kind in British waters. The aircraft was first spotted by divers in 2008, lying 50ft below the surface on a chalk bed, surrounded by debris. Scroll down for video . Underwater images of the WW2 Dornier lying in 50ft of water off the Kent . coast. Work began today to raise what is the only surviving . World War Two Nazi bomber from its watery grave in the English Channel . Under the sea: A Dornier Do 17 bomber which lies off the coast of Kent is set to be recovered . Sonar scans carried out by the RAF Museum, Wessex Archaeology and the Port of London Authority confirmed that the plane is the Dornier Do 17Z Werke number 1160, which was shot down during the Battle of Britain. Two of its four-man crew were killed as it crashed into the sea, but the other two were captured and taken into custody as prisoners of war. The plane, which is said to be in 'remarkable condition', was one of the Luftwaffe's 'flying pencil' bombers, named for their narrow fuselage. It is covered in coral, barnacles and other marine life, but is otherwise largely intact. The main undercarriage tyres remain inflated and the propellers clearly show the damage inflicted during the bomber's final crash landing. Lifting the plane from the sea will take around three weeks using pioneering technology, and will be dependent on tides and weather conditions. Mission: Recovery workers prepare the mechanism which will help to retrieve the German plane from the Channel . Unprecedented: This will be the biggest operation of its kind ever to take place in British waters . The Dornier Do 17 was known as the 'flying pencil', because of its unusually narrow fuselage. It was one of the main bombers used by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War, including at the Battle of Britain in 1940. The plane was developed to be a commercial aircraft, but was turned down by Lufthansa and redesigned into a bomber. Although the Do 17 was no longer made after 1940, it was used by Nazi forces throughout the war. More than 400 of them were flown in the Battle of Britain, with 171 shot down by the RAF or otherwise lost. The planes were 52ft long with a wingspan of 59ft, and could carry 2,000lb of explosives while manned by a crew of four. None of the aircraft were believed to have survived for long after the end of the conflict, until the discovery of the plane off the coast of Kent. A frame will be built around the aircraft underwater, and will then be slowly winched up and placed on a floating platform. The operation has been made possible by a grant of more than £345,000 from the National Heritage Memorial Fund. Air Vice-Marshal Peter Dye, director general of the RAF Museum, said: 'The discovery and recovery of the Dornier is of national and international importance. 'The aircraft is a unique and unprecedented survivor from the Battle of Britain and the Blitz. 'It will provide an evocative and moving exhibit that will allow the museum to present the wider story of the Battle of Britain and highlight the sacrifices made by the young men of both air forces and from many nations.' When the Dornier has been recovered, it will be prepared for display at the RAF Museum in Hendon, North London. The preservation work will take place at the museum's conservation centre in Cosford, Shropshire, where the plane will be placed in two hydration tunnels and soaked in citric acid. Channel: The plane was sunk in Goodwin Sands, off the coast of Kent near Deal . In action: A Dornier bomber similar to the one which crashed into the sea during the Battle of Britain . Culture minister Ed Vaizey said: 'Today marks the beginning of an exciting project to raise the last surviving Dornier Do 17 bomber from the English Channel. 'I'm delighted the RAF Museum and the NHMF have joined forces to make this project possible and I know that it will be a tremendous addition to the museum's collection where it will serve to educate and entertain all who visit.' The Dornier Do 17 will join a range of more than 1,200 objects and places which have been safeguarded by the NHMF at a cost of more than £300million. These include HMS Caroline, the last surviving First World War ship, a rare collection of work by codebreaker Alan Turing and HMS Alliance, the last surviving submarine of the Second World War. The Dornier is not the only Second World War plane to be the subject of a recovery mission - a British enthusiast is currently searching for a haul of Spitfires lost in the Burmese jungle. David Cundall has hired a team of workers to find the 36 fighters which he says were delivered to the country at the very end of the war.","German bomber has lain in English Channel since the Battle of Britain .

The illegitimate former drug-addict son of legendary singer Tom Jones said on Saturday that he became a gun-carrying dealer who slept rough because he was abandoned by Sir Tom, who . has always refused to acknowledge his existence. Aspiring singer Jonathan Berkery, 24, who uses the stage name Jon Jones, slept on . park benches, in his car or homeless shelters for more than two years . after he was befriended by a drug gang as a teenager. Mr Berkery’s mother Katherine, who was a . model, became pregnant at 24 after a three-day fling with Sir Tom in . 1987. She met the singer in a New York nightclub when he was 47. Jonathan Berkery, 24, said he became a gun-carrying drug dealer who slept rough because he was abandoned by Sir Tom, who has always refused to acknowledge his existence . Mr Berkery blames a lot of his issues on Sir Tom, claiming: ‘It all stems back to my dad. I don’t think I realised it for a long time but I was one angry kid, crying out for a father.’ His mother was forced to take Sir Tom to court in 1989 and was handed $2,500 a month in child support after DNA tests revealed he was the father. After the settlement at family court in Manhattan, Miss Berkery said that she thought her former lover  was 'disgusting', according to the LA Times. However, although the Welsh singer has fulfilled his responsibilities financially, he has refused to provide the emotional support Mr Berkery craved growing up. Mr Berkery said he never received a phone call or birthday card from Sir Tom and it ruined his life. He said: ‘I was very angry. My anger boiled over in school – I fought every kid and rebelled constantly.

Mr Berkery (pictured as a child, left with his mother), claims he slept on park benches, in his car or homeless shelters for more than two years after he was befriended by a drug gang . 'I lost count of the times I changed schools. I needed a father figure. I leaned towards older bad guys. 'Sometimes I wanted to meet my father, sometimes I didn’t. It’s the same now – I am totally conflicted.’ Mr Berkery said he turned to drugs to help him cope with rejection from Jones, and so began his downward spiral which led to him dealing and carrying guns. He said: ‘I tried to numb the pain with drugs – I’ve been smoking weed since I was 16 and I progressed to prescription pills, then ecstasy and cocaine. 'I was never a heavy drug user. I just dabbled. But when I was selling drugs I wasn’t really using. I bought two pistols. I called them The Brothers and wore them in shoulder holsters.’ Although the Welsh singer (right) has fulfilled . his responsibilities financially, he has refused to provide the . emotional support Mr Berkery (left) said he craved growing up .

An explosion has rocked Camp Bastion just days after three soldiers were killed in armoured truck by Taliban bomb. The blast occurred last night at an ammunition depot within the base and five people later went to hospital to receive treatment. Flight stopped amid fears the Afghanistan base was under attack, although they have since resumed - the explosion is not thought to be a terror attack. Explosion: British military vehicles sit in a compound in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan. An explosion occurred within the grounds at an ammunition depot last night . The heavily fortified Camp Bastion was damaged in February after insurgents launched a rocket attack on the main coalition military base in Afghanistan's Helmand province. Last September, two US Marines were killed and six Harrier jets destroyed when militants breached the perimeter fence and attacked Camp Leatherneck, the US headquarters next to Camp Bastion. The incident comes just days after the Taliban launched its ‘spring offensive’ against coalition forces. The Taliban said they would infiltrate ‘enemy ranks’ to conduct ‘insider attacks’ and target military and diplomatic sites with suicide bombers. Meanwhile British special forces in . Afghanistan have uncovered a cache of homemade bombs primed for use in a . raid just five miles from the Mastiff blast which killed three . soldiers. Members of . the elite unit - codenamed Task Force 42 - helped seize 27 . pressure-plate improvised explosive devices (IEDs) at a secretive . Taliban weapons factory. Killed: Corporal William Thomas Savage, left, and . Fusiler Samuel Flint, both served in the Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd . Battalion, The Royal Regiment Of Scotland (2 Scots) and died this week after a Taliban blast hit their armoured vehicle . They also discovered rounds for AK-47 semi-automatic rifles and other military equipment stockpiled by insurgents near the village of Mohamadzai, Helmand. The mission, led by the Afghan National Army Special Forces, took place just hours after Corporal William Savage, 30, Fusilier Sam Flint, 21, and Private Robert Hetherington, 25, died and six others were injured when their armoured vehicle was blown up by a massive roadside bomb. The IED, assessed to be easily in excess of 400lbs, was one of the biggest ever detonated during the war. Targeted: Three British soldiers were killed in Afghanistan when their Mastiff armoured vehicle which was introduced to protect troops was devastated by a huge roadside bomb (file picture) Killed: The soldiers (not pictured) were flown to the military hospital at Camp Bastion but could not be saved . The blast, during a patrol along Route 611 in Nahr-e Seraj district, was so powerful it hurled the 23-ton personnel carrier into the air and rolled it onto its roof. The victims, deployed with the Royal Highland Fusiliers, the 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, were the first to be killed in a Mastiff, which offers world-beating protection from explosions. Crucially, the blast did not penetrate the £1million vehicle's armour. Major Tim Petransky, a spokesman for The Royal Highland Fusiliers, said: 'The loss of three of our brothers in arms in any circumstances would be tragic but to lose three in one go is a hammer blow.' The Army is now urgently investigating whether the seized cache could be linked to Tuesday's attack. The discovery, along with two similar-sized finds in the warzone, came as the Taliban launched a so-called 'Spring Offensive' against Coalition troops. Military scientists are examining the remains of the Mastiff to discover if any additional protection can feasibly be added. Scene: The soldiers were on a routine patrol in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand Province . In due course it will be flown back to the UK where extensive tests will be carried out to determine any vulnerabilities. Early indications suggest the roadside bomb was covertly dug under Route 611, a layer of Tarmac which is a key road through central Helmand, and triggered by remote control. Meanwhile, experts from the Counter-IED Task Force and the Royal Military Police are examining debris for any 'forensic fingerprint' that might give commanders a clue to identify those behind the bomb. Investigators are concerned that a new form of threat, such as a sophisticated remote-controlled command wire, may have been used. This may point to the involvement of Iranians having an input in the attack. Iran is known to have developed a new 'bomb initiator' which was allegedly used by Hezbollah in bus attacks against Israeli civilians last year. A UK bomb disposal operator who recently returned from Helmand said: 'We need to establish quickly how they set this one off. It looks like a deep bundle of explosives in the road and I suspect they had help from an outside agency, Iran, in pulling this off.' The bomb expert pointed out that the UK task force, 1 Mechanized Brigade, had only recently started its six-month deployment in Helmand. He said: 'The insurgents would have known this and taken advantage and there is the possibility that the route was not as well patrolled as it had been. 'But the detonation device is the critical factor, we need to identify it and intercept any future use.'","The explosion last night is not thought to be a terror attack .

'Never had a chance to say goodbye': Felicity Kendal has told how she regrets allowing her friendship with Richard Briers to fall apart . Felicity Kendal has told how she regrets allowing her friendship with Richard Briers to fall apart. The veteran actor, her co-star in The Good Life, died before she had a chance to get back in touch. Instead of being able to say goodbye to Briers when she heard he was ill, Miss Kendal's farewell came at his funeral just under a fortnight ago. During the several years they worked together on The Good Life, she, Briers and the 1970s sitcom's other main cast members, Penelope Keith and Paul Eddington, formed a tight friendship. It was, Miss Kendal recalls, a source of strength for her at a time when her private life was in turmoil. But it seems the friendship faded over the years. In an interview yesterday, the 66-year-old actress admitted she found out about Briers's illness only when she read an article in the Daily Mail days before his death. She said: 'I try not to do regrets – I think they're such a waste of time – but I now have one. Not having kept in closer touch recently with Richard Briers – or Dickie as I used to call him – is a real sadness to me now that he has gone.

'She seems to have disappeared in a strange way,' Briers said. 'She's an extraordinary girl. I don't really know who she is. Never did. 'She became enamoured with [playwright Tom] Stoppard.

However, Miss Kendal said in a Sunday newspaper: 'This lovely man was one of the funniest I have ever met and I loved him dearly. 'He taught me so much about the craft of comedy. He was generous to work with and was always beyond sweet and patient to me. 'At the time we worked together on The Good Life, he was also supportive of my complex and traumatic personal life.

A little girl in a red coat becomes the catalyst which saves the lives of more than 1,000 Jews destined for the concentration camps in Steven Spielberg’s celebrated film Schindler's List. But for the now 24-year-old woman who played the role in 1993, the iconic appearance left her traumatised for years. Oliwia Dabrowska was three years old when she starred as the girl in the red coat – the only flash of colour in the otherwise black-and-white film. Scroll down for video . Unwilling star: Oliwia Dabrowska, aged three, plays the iconic 'girl in the red coat' in 1993 Oscar winning Schindler's List . Traumatised: Oliwia Dabrowska, 24, played a little girl in red coat in film Schindler's List and says it ruined years of her life . 'I was ashamed of being in the movie and angry with my mother and father when they told anyone about the part,' the university student told The Times. She added that starring in the film led to much unwanted attention and harassment from well-meaning adults and school friends. ‘People said: “It must be so important to you, you must know so much about the Holocaust” I was frustrated by it all.’ Oliwia, from Krakow, said . she was ‘horrified’ when watching the film for the first time at the age . of 11, breaking her promise to director Steven Spielberg to wait until . she was 18. She told the newspaper: 'I kept it secret for a long, long time, though at high school people got to know on the internet. 'People said: ""It must be so important to you, you must know so much about the Holocaust."" I was frustrated by it all.' One of  the most disturbing scenes is one showing the SS officer Amon Goeth, played by Ralph Fiennes, who arbitrarily shoots women and children from his window. Oliwia told The Times: 'It was too horrible. I could not understand much, but I was sure that I didn't want to watch ever again in my life.' In the film, Ms Dabrowska plays a ‘little girl in the red coat’ spotted by Nazi industrialist Oskar Schindler during the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto in 1943. Real life hero: Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, who sees the girl in the red coat and realises the impact of the Holocaust in the Oscar winning Schindler's List, which is based on true events . On-screen horror: A still from the 1993 film depicting Plazow concentration camp and its vicious commander Amon Goth, centre, played by Ralph Fiennes . Traumatic: One of the most disturbing scenes for Oliwia is one showing the SS officer Amon Goeth, played by Ralph Fiennes, who arbitrarily shoots women and children from his window . 'He was right': Oliwia said she should have listened to Steven Spielberg, pictured at the recognition of the 20th Anniversary of Schindler's List last week, and waited until she was 18 before watching Schindler's List . Nazi businessman and factory owner Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson, sees . her wander through the crowds, her coat standing out among the sea of . grey, and later spots her on a cart carrying dead bodies. It . is after this harrowing experience that Schindler decides to draw up a . list of Jewish workers in order to spare as many lives as he can. The . film is based on the real life actions of Oskar . Schindler, who was credited with saving more than 1,200 Jews during the . Holocaust. Ms Dabrowska says that although she now feels honoured to have played the role, it took her years to come to terms with it. Saved from hell: Oskar Schindler saved his workers from the horrors of Plaszow concentration camp, south of Krakow, where the infamous Amon Goeth would shoot prisoners when he was bored . She now regrets having watched it at such an early age, and although she swore never to watch it again, she gave it another go at the age of 18 – just as she had promised the Oscar winning director. 'I realised I had been part of something I could be proud of. Spielberg was right: I had to grow up to watch the film.' Ms Dabrowska continues to act in her spare time and is currently in her third year of a Library Science degree and hopes to go into publishing. Schindler's List, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, won seven Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, seven BAFTAs and three Golden Globes, and is often ranked among the best films ever made. Saviour: Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 of his Jewish workers during the Holocaust . Oskar Schindler was an ethnic German born in what is now the Czech Republic, in 1908. A businessman, he saw the opportunities in profiting from the German invasion of Poland and bought an enamelware factory in Krakow. He was a member of the Nazi party and mingled with the SS elite in the city. He employed a large number of Jewish workers in his factory, mainly due to the lower costs of employing Jews after the German invasion. After witnessing a raid during the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto, Oskar Schindler was shocked to find many of his employees murdered and created his legendary list of 'Schindlerjuden' (Schindler's Jews) to be spared from deportation to work in his factory.

As the Holocaust continued Schindler used his lists to protect the over 1,200 workers and their families on his list. He would go out of his way to convince SS inspectors that women, children and even the disabled were essential workers in his factory to spare them from being sent to the camps. Having spent his fortune on bribes and black-market wares to for his workers, a destitute Schindler and his wife fled to Austria after the war. He died, penniless, in Germany in 1974 at the age of 66, and was buried in Jerusalem.

He has gained a new generation of fans as a judge on The Voice, where he is cast as the father-figure. It is, however, a side to 72-year-old Tom Jones that his illegitimate former drug-addict son is still waiting to see. Jonathan Berkery, 24, said yesterday he became a gun-carrying drug dealer who slept rough because he was abandoned by Sir Tom, who has always refused to acknowledge his existence. Jonathan Berkery, 24, said he became a gun-carrying drug dealer who slept rough because he was abandoned by Sir Tom, who has always refused to acknowledge his existence . Mr Berkery, who uses the name Jon Jones, slept on park benches, in his car or homeless shelters for more than two years after he was befriended by a drug gang as a teenager. And he blames Sir Tom, claiming: ‘It all stems back to my dad. I don’t think I realised it for a long time but I was one angry kid, crying out for a father.’ Mr Berkery’s mother Katherine, who was a model, became pregnant at 24 after a three-day fling with Sir Tom in 1987 when he was 47. She was forced to take Sir Tom to court and was handed £1,700 a month in child support after DNA tests revealed he was the father. However, although the Welsh singer has fulfilled his responsibilities financially, he has refused to provide the emotional support Mr Berkery craved growing up. Mr Berkery said he never received a phone call or birthday card from Sir Tom and it ruined his life. He said: ‘I was very angry.

It’s the same now – I am totally conflicted.’ Mr Berkery said he turned to drugs to help him cope with rejection from Sir Tom, and so began his downward spiral which led to him dealing and carrying guns. He said: ‘I tried to numb the pain with drugs – I’ve been smoking weed since I was 16 and I progressed to prescription pills, then ecstasy and cocaine. 'I was never a heavy drug user. I just dabbled.

I had drug counselling and lived in a shelter.’ Now he has moved back in with his estate agent mother in Charlotte, North Carolina, and is determined to carve out a career as a singer ‘to prove myself in spite of my father’. Mr Berkery said he often fantasises about appearing on The Voice, the BBC1 talent show which began a second series on Saturday night, to force Sir Tom to acknowledge him. He said: ‘I like to imagine that I am on the show singing, he swivels around in his big chair, realises I am his son and I just make a rude gesture at him with my middle finger.’ He added: ‘My feelings for him are conflicted – he is my biological father but he has never been a dad.

A second Republican senator has spoken out in support of same-sex marriage in less than a month. Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, who suffered a severe stroke last year and returned to the chamber in January, said ‘government has no place in the middle’ of two people in love, regardless of gender. Kirk, who previously opposed a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, said in a post on his blog on Tuesday that ‘same-sex couples should have the right to civil marriage.’ U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk (R-IL) has become the second senate Republican to back same-sex marriage . ‘Our time on this Earth is limited, I know that better than most,’ said Kirk, who suffered a stroke in January 2012. ‘Life comes down to who you love and who loves you back - government has no place in the middle.’ Kirk went through months of rehabilitation before returning to work in Washington this January. He said in his blog post that when he went back to the Senate he promised himself he would return ‘with an open mind and greater respect for others.' Kirk is Illinois' highest ranking Republican lawmaker. He had previously voted to end the policy barring gays from openly serving in the military, known as ‘Don't Ask, Don't Tell.’ He's also a lead co-sponsor of a bill . to ban employment discrimination based on sexual orientation, and has . opposed a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. He also supported Illinois GOP . Chairman Pat Brady after Brady announced his support for same-sex . marriage earlier this year. When some members of the state central . committee attempted to oust Brady, Kirk said Brady had his full support. 'Evolved': Senator Rob Portman came out in support of same-sex marriage after he revealed that his son Will (center back) is gay . The issue of gay marriage was also in the news last week when the Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases on the issue. The nation's highest court is considering the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which denies same-sex couples federal benefits, and California's ban on gay marriage. Kirk has become the second sitting Republican senator to make such an announcement in recent weeks. Last month, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman became the first Republican senator to reverse his position on legalizing same-sex marriage. Portman, considered last year as a running mate by the Romney campaign, said he reversed his stance against gay marriage after his 21-year-old son Will came out to him and his wife. 'It allowed me to think of this issue from a new perspective, and that's of a Dad who loves his son a lot and wants him to have the same opportunities that his brother and sister would have - to have a relationship like Jane and I have had for over 26 years,' Portman told The Plain Dealer. 'The overriding message of love and compassion that I take from the Bible, and certainly the Golden Rule, and the fact that I believe we are all created by our maker, that has all influenced me in terms of my change on this issue.' Sen. Mark Kirk said serious illness had caused him to reconsider and he now believed that 'government has no place in the middle' of two people in love, regardless of gender . He said he had spent some time speaking to his church in Cincinnati and former Vice President Dick Cheney, whose daughter is gay. In the wake of his announcement, Portman was attacked by senior Republicans and angry voters. As of this writing, only seven Democrats in the chamber still oppose changing the definition of marriage. But others in the party are less inclined to change their position even when they too have gay relatives. Republican congressman Matt Salmon from Arizona said on Monday that even though his son is gay, he refuses to support same-sex marriage, saying that he's 'just not there.' 'As far as believing in my heart that we should change 2000 years of social policy in favor of a redefinition of the family. I'm not there,' Congressman Salmon said. Political pressure: Congressman Matt Salmon (center) said that he does not support same-sex marriage even though his son, also named Matt (center right) is gay . 'My son is by far one of the most important people in my life, I love him more than I could say,' he told local station 3TV News. 'I don’t believe that this is a lifestyle that he chose. 'It doesn't mean that I don’t have respect. It doesn't mean that I don’t sympathize with some of the issues, it just means that I haven't evolved to that station. Rob Portman apparently has.' The congressman's son, who is also named Matt Salmon, has been out and proud for a number of years, and told a Phoenix paper that he told his mother that he was gay when he was 14-years-old. His parents' anti-gay stance has not stopped the younger Matt Salmon from making his own way in state politics, becoming the president of the Arizona Log Cabin Republicans and posing for a photo shoot with his boyfriend for the Phoenix New Times. Open: Matt Salmon Jr (left, and right on right) posed for a photo shoot with his boyfriend in a Phoenix paper in 2010 . Adding to the complicated situation in the Salmon family is the fact that they are all devout Mormons, a faith that bans homosexuality. At the time of the interview in 2010, Matt was dating Kent Flake, who also has family connections to Republican politicians in the state, and the pair both decided to leave the church because of their conflicts with their sexuality. They received frosty welcomes from their families, who were not thrilled by the coupling. 'Everybody's pretty much told me, ""You're fine, we love you, but your partner's not welcome because we don't want gay around us."" And I'm like, ""Well, I am gay. What if he doesn't act gay? Is that okay? Can he come around?""' Matt told the paper. Family values: Congressman Matt Salmon (center) and his wife Nancy (center left) are firmly anti-gay but they still love their gay son Matt (far right) In today's Washington Post article, the younger Matt tells how he and his father have a strong relationship but recognize their differences when it comes to homosexuality. 'I love my father and realize that he can have the opinions that he has, and they might differ from mine, but that doesn’t change the way I feel about him,' he said. 'I definitely share my feelings, but I don’t pressure him to change his opinion because I know that given our relationship there’s no real need to do that. We each know where we stand.'","Sen.

In a bid to stop student loan rates from doubling next month, President Obama got personal in a speech Friday morning at the White House. Flanked by current college students, he spoke of his and Michelle's own struggle with student loan debt. 'Michelle and I, we did not finish paying off our student loans until about nine years ago, and our student loans cost more than our mortgage,' Obama said. 'Right when we wanted to start saving for Sasha and Malia's college education, we were still paying off our own college education.' Interest rates on new subsidized Stafford loans are set to go from 3.4 per cent to 6.8 per cent on July 1. Lawmakers from both parties say they want to avoid the increase but are divided over how to do so. Scroll down for video . 'We didn't come from privilege': President Obama told his and Michelle's personal story of student loan debt at the White House on Friday in an attempt to stop interest rates from increasing . Obama said if Congress doesn't act to stop loan rates from rising, students would rack up an additional $1,000 annually in debt. 'That's like a $1,000 tax hike,' the president said. Obama made his case flanked by college students wearing business suits and dresses on a steamy Washington morning in the Rose Garden. The event marked the beginning of a public campaign by the president to extend temporarily current student loan rates or find a long-term compromise to avoid the rate increase. The event also gave the president a chance to try to move past political controversies that have been dogging his agenda, including investigations into last year's deadly attack in Libya, political targeting at the IRS and secret monitoring of journalists who reported stories based on national security leaks. Obama opened his Rose Garden appearance by touting economic improvements during his presidency. Student loan interest rates set to double: The chart above shows how much college graduates will actually be paying after 10 years of loan debt . Obama said rising college debt - more than $26,000 on average for a four-year degree - saddles young adults with debt just as they are starting out and prevents them from buying cars and houses, hurting the economy overall. 'That doesn't just hold back our young graduates. It holds back our entire middle class,' Obama said. The White House has proposed linking federal student loan rates to the financial markets. The Republican-controlled House passed a plan last week that would reset student loan rates every year according to financial markets, but Obama has threatened to veto the bill in part because it doesn't lock in current low rates. 'The House bill isn't smart and it's not fair,' Obama said. But House Republicans weren't too keen on the speech, accusing Obama of playing politics instead of sitting down to work out small differences and avoid an increase. Brainy Obama: A picture of the president during his days at Harvard Law School, where Michelle also attended. The two met at the law firm Sidley Austin in Chicago . The road to college: President Obama graduating from high school in Hawaii . Honor student: First lady Michelle Obama graduated cum laude from Princeton in 1985. President Obama said in his speech that neither of them would be in the White House without their college education . 'The differences between the House plan and the president's are small, and there's no reason they cannot be overcome quickly,' Boehner said in a statement. 'But today, rather than working to resolve the issue, the president resorted to a campaign stunt to try to score political points. If the president is truly unhappy with inaction, the only place to look is the Democratic-run Senate, which has taken no action to prevent rates from doubling.' The Senate is scheduled to vote on the issue next week, said Majority Leader Harry Reid. The Senate version would freeze current rates for two years while Congress works on a long-term fix, something the White House says Obama supports. Obama spoke personally about the power of an advanced degree, saying he and his wife are only in the White House because of their education. 'We didn't come from privilege,' the president said. Higher education cannot be a luxury for a privileged few,' Obama said. 'It is an economic necessity that every family should be able to afford, every young person with dreams and ambition should be able to access.'","Interest rates on student loans are set to double next month, from 3.4 per cent to 6.8 per cent .

"Ambulance arrived within one minute but Adam died in hospital . By . Anna Hodgekiss . PUBLISHED: . 04:53 EST, 26 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:34 EST, 26 April 2013 . An eight-year-old boy collapsed and died after an asthma attack at a friend's birthday party, an inquest heard. Adam Mark Winfandale, who used two inhalers to manage the illness, was rushed to hospital on June 5, 2011 and was pronounced dead on arrival. He was having fun with pals at a Quasar laser quest event in Chester when he suffered breathing difficulties. An inquest jury at Warrington Town Hall heard yesterday how Adam's mother, Susan Jones, said despite his asthma he was a healthy boy who enjoyed tennis, swimming lessons and doing activities with the Cubs and Scouts. Tragedy: Adam Winfandale collapsed and died after an asthma attack at a friend's birthday party . 'Adam's asthma was very manageable,' she said. 'We had never had a panic moment. I always had a warning with his asthma, as it was always a slow build up.' But on Sunday June 5, Adam left his home at Bryn Celyn, Moss, Wrexham, north Wales, to join his friends at Quasar and died after encountering breathing difficulties. A parent at the party, Janet Ellams, said Miss Jones had explained to her about Adam's asthma and had given his inhaler to her. 'He won't need it, it's just in case,' Miss Jones said. 'He will know when he needs it and how much he can take.' The children arrived at Quasar at 11am and were given a health and safety briefing where Adam was asked about his asthma and if he was fine to play. Staff deemed he was able to play and the game began. Ms Ellams said: 'About 15 minutes in Adam came out and said he needed his inhaler. He seemed quite calm when he came out. He was standing against the wall and wanting to get back into the game.' Miss Jones was called and told Adam had asked for his inhaler and she said her son would know what to do. But Adam said the inhaler was not working and became distressed and agitated. The inquest heard that there may have been some particles in the air at Quasar (pictured) which could have been a contributory factor to Adam's asthma attack . The hearing was told Adam's condition worsened in just a matter of minutes. An ambulance was called and Adam was carried outside for more air. Witnesses said he was rigid and his lips and hands were blue. The ambulance arrived in one minute and Adam was treated immediately en route to the Countess of Chester Hospital. Miss Jones was called and headed straight to the hospital to see her son but Adam was pronounced dead at the hospital at 3.20pm. Adam Salmon, co-owner of Quasar, told the hearing the game Adam was playing usually involved smoke, music and lighting. But on this occasion the liquid smoke machine was not working and had been broken for a couple of weeks. An inquest jury at Warrington Town Hall heard that despite his asthma, Adam was a healthy boy who enjoyed tennis, swimming lessons and Scouts . Mr Salmon said there could have been some particles in the air which could have been a contributory factor to Adam's asthma attack. During the inquest Adam's parents raised concerns about whether Quasar had good health and safety policies in place. But Helen Stott, lead environmental health practitioner for Cheshire West and Chester Council, said Quasar had followed all health and safety rules and complied with all relevant legislation. In the week leading up to the party Adam had been on holiday with Miss Jones in Majorca and had no asthma or breathing troubles. They returned on Saturday, June 4 and Adam was described as being 'very well'. The inquest, before Cheshire assistant deputy coroner Alan Moore, continues.","Adam Mark Winfandale's condition 'was very manageable', said mother .

Hidden information: Lord Justice Treacy call for names of those arrested by police to be kept secret . Two senior judges yesterday called for secret arrests where the public would lose the right to know who the police detain. They said this is necessary because when an arrest is publicised it causes ‘irremediable damage to the person’s reputation’. The demand for draconian rules – made . on behalf of the entire judiciary – raises the spectre of a legal regime . under which the targets of police raids could be seized and questioned . while the public are kept in the dark. Even families and friends would . be held in ignorance and unable to help. Free speech campaigners condemned the call as ‘very dangerous’ with the potential for ‘great harm’. Earlier this week it was revealed that . the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) is drawing up plans . meant to apply across the country to prevent police forces from . releasing the names of those they arrest. The latest intervention was made by . two senior figures, Lord Justice Treacy and Mr Justice Tugendhat. Lord . Justice Treacy presided in 2010 over the first serious criminal trial in . 350 years to go ahead without a jury. The trial of four armed robbers . sentenced to a total of 64 years in jail was excepted from usual . democratic rules because of fears over jury-nobbling. Mr Justice Tugendhat is the most . senior High Court judge dealing with libel and media law. The judges . said they backed the conclusion of Lord Justice Leveson in his report on . press ethics that only in exceptional circumstances should details of . those arrested or suspected of crime be made known to the public. They said police must consider the . human right to privacy and added: ‘The police arrest many people who are . never charged. 'If there were a policy that the police should . consistently publish the fact that a person has been arrested, in many . cases that information would attract substantial publicity, causing . irremediable damage to the person’s reputation. ‘Even if the fact that the person was . not charged were subsequently published, that would not receive the same . publicity, and would not prevent subsequent internet searches . disclosing that the person had been arrested.’ In the dark: Mr Justice Tugendhat argue that when an arrest is publicised it causes 'irremediable damage to the person's reputation' and should therefore be kept from public knowledge . The two judges said they were speaking . ‘on the basis of the judiciary’s interest in the effective . administration of justice’. They said their opinion reflected the views . of various judges including the President of the Queen’s Bench Division . Sir John Thomas, whose courts deal with libel, the Senior Presiding . Judge Lord Justice Gross and Lord Justice Leveson. They added: ‘It has not been possible, . however, to consult all relevant judges.’ Among a number of senior . figures missed out of their consultations appear to be the Lord Chief . Justice Lord Judge, the most senior judge in England and Wales, who is . on record as a strong supporter of freedom of expression. 'The police arrest many people who are never charged. If there were a policy that the police should consistently publish the fact that a person has been arrested, in many cases that information would attract substantial publicity, causing irremediable damage to the person’s reputation. Even if the fact that the person  was not charged were subsequently published, that would not receive the same publicity, and would not prevent subsequent internet searches disclosing  that the person had been arrested. We adopt the words of Leveson LJ in his report: ‘‘The current guidance in this area needs to be strengthened. For example, I think that it should be made abundantly clear that save in exceptional and clearly defined circumstances (for example, where there may be a risk to the public), the names or identifying details of those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not  be released to the press nor  the public.’ The judicial paper was produced as a . response to the Law Commission, the Government’s law reform quango, . which recommended last year that the Home Office and ACPO should develop . a national system under which ‘the names of arrestees will be released . but that appropriate safeguards will need to be put in place’. The judges replied that the law should . ‘protect the rights of suspects, defendants and witnesses, in . particular their rights to reputation and privacy’. They also raised the prospect of a new law which would allow those arrested and named in public to sue for compensation. ‘It may be that the civil law should . be reformed to give a remedy for the publication of prejudicial . information, in addition to the law of contempt,’ the two judges said. They said exceptions to secret arrests would be ‘only in exceptional and . clearly defined circumstances’, for example when there is an immediate . risk to the public. The move by the judges produced alarm . among freedom of speech campaigners. Kirsty Hughes of Index on . Censorship said: ‘There are of course circumstances where it may be . better not to release the names of people who are arrested. ‘But to set this up as a norm could . prove very dangerous. The actions of the police must operate under the . principle of open justice, and this includes arrest. The introduction of . de facto secret arrests has potential for great harm.’ Earlier this . week David Ormerod QC, the author of the Law Commission’s report, said . that ‘it is imperative that we have confidence that our legal process is . transparent.’ He added that it was ‘not hard to imagine cases of clear . public interest in which arrests should be reported’. But ACPO said that police chiefs were . looking to protect the public in line with Lord Justice Leveson’s . recommendations, and that under its new rules there will ‘most likely be . exceptions in the interests of justice and to prevent and detect . crime’. Opponents of secret arrests say the . suppression of information means that witnesses or other victims of a . criminal will not come forward.","Lord Justice Treacey and Mr Justice Tugendhat want anonymous arrests .

No-nonsense approach: Jo Frost has been criticised for her views on when a child should be moved from a cot to a bed . She can rein in the unruliest of toddlers, tame ugly  tantrums, and – seemingly without effort – has calmed many a nightmarish household overrun by naughty children. But, as Supernanny Jo Frost has discovered, woe betide anyone who comes between mothers’ groups and their views on certain parenting milestones. The TV nanny has found herself embroiled in a row after dispensing ‘irresponsible’ and ‘dangerous’ advice on when is best to move one’s toddler from a cot to a full-sized bed. Miss Frost, whose no-nonsense approach to child-rearing has earned her many fans as well as plenty of detractors, gave the advice in her latest book, saying mothers should wait for as long as possible before making the switchover. In the book, Jo Frost’s Toddler SOS, the 41-year-old is asked by a parent: ‘At what age do you generally move toddlers from a cot to a bed? It sounds like a stupid question but I have no idea.’ Miss Frost replies: ‘I see no rush unless she’s grown out of it and the cot has become too narrow a space to sleep in. If she’s sleeping well it’s definitely not worth disrupting her.’ The advice has provoked a backlash on parenting forums, including Netmums, with dozens of mothers saying they were shocked and surprised. One wrote: ‘There is more risk of your child hurting themselves falling whilst clambering over the bars of a cot than there is getting in and out of a toddler bed.’ Another added: ‘I’m shocked that she [Jo Frost] would think it ok to allow a child to climb out of a cot. My eldest did it at 17 months and fell head first, she could have had a nasty injury.’ Controversy: Miss Frost, a profsesional nanny, made her debut in 2004 on the Channel 4's Supernanny . ‘This is one time when you need to ignore Jo Frost and trust your own instincts,’ another posted. Miss Frost, a professional nanny, made her debut in 2004 on Channel 4’s Supernanny, a reality show in which she is called in to family homes and assists parents who are struggling with their children’s behaviour. Some of her methods have provoked debate in the past, such as banishing unruly children to a ‘naughty step’ – with some experts claiming this could cause emotional damage – or ‘coaching’ them to fall asleep by leaving them to cry. Clare Byam-Cook, a former midwife and celebrity anti-natal coach, yesterday expressed surprise over the star’s latest piece of advice. She said the general consensus is that children are moved at around the age of two because this is when they run the risk of climbing out of a cot and risking injury. Mrs Byam-Cook, whose clients have included Helena Bonham Carter and Kate Winslet, added: ‘I am amazed she should say that because the point is once a child can start climbing out of a cot you risk them climbing out and falling.’ Delaying the move too long can cause other problems, she added. ‘Most people have two-year gap between children and the last thing you want is to have a new baby needing to transition from Moses basket into a cot and have the cot still occupied by a toddler,’ said Mrs Byam-Cook. ‘Then if you try and move the toddler out of the cot you’re going to have an unhappy toddler who thinks that he is being moved into his own bed for your convenience rather than because he’s become a grown up.’ Miss Frost based her argument on the belief that moving a child from his or her cot too early could prompt juvenile sleep problems. ‘I’m a huge admirer of hers,’ Mrs Byam-Cook said, but added: ‘Of course, Jo meets children of all ages in her problem solving but perhaps something like safety of babies doesn’t register highly in her experience.’","Jo Frost said children should stay in a cot until they outgrow it in new book .

But Scottish skipper Andrew Leaper will probably settle for the glory - and a new world record - after discovering a message in a bottle 98 YEARS after it was thrown into the ocean. Me Leaper came across the bottle by chance . while hauling in his nets, but almost lost it after it fell back into the sea before . he rescued it. He then noticed it contained a message  asking the finder to record the date and location . of the discovery and return the item to the Director of the Fishery Board . for Scotland - for a reward of sixpence. The crew learned the bottle - . labelled as drift bottle 646B - had been thrown into the sea almost a century ago by . Captain CH Brown of the Glasgow School of Navigation. It was one of 1,890 bottles designed to sink downwards and float close to the seabed in . an attempt to monitor the under-currents of the seas around Scotland. To date, only 315 of the bottles . have ever been located, but Captain’s Brown’s original log, now held in . Aberdeen by Marine Science Scotland, is still updated every time one is . tracked down. Incredibly, the discovery was made on Copius, the . same Shetland-based fishing boat which recorded the previous world . record for the longest time a drift bottle has been known to spend at . sea, in 2006. Mr Leaper, 43, joked that his friend and . colleague Mark Anderson, who set the previous record in  was 'very . unhappy' his find had been surpassed. He said: 'He never stopped talking . about it and now I am the one who is immensely proud to be the finder . of the world record message in a bottle. 'As . we hauled in the nets I spotted the bottle neck sticking out and I . quickly grabbed it before it fell back in the sea. I couldn’t wait to . open it. 'It was an amazing . coincidence that the same Shetland fishing boat that found the previous . record-breaking bottle six years ago also found this one. 'It’s like winning the lottery twice. This is a very popular fishing ground, with half the North Sea fleet fishing here.' Scottish . environment secretary Richard Lochhead added that it was possible . another of the bottles released in 1914 could go on to break the record . again. He said: 'The story . of scientific drift bottles is a fascinating one and harks back to an . area when we were only beginning to understand the complexities of the . seas. Return to sender: The message inside the bottle asked the finder to record the date and location of the discovery and return the item to the Director of the Fishery Board for Scotland - for a reward of sixpence . Coincidence: Incredibly, Mr Leaper made the discovery on Copius, the same Shetland-based fishing boat which recorded the previous world record for the longest time a drift bottle has been known to spend at sea, in 2006 . 'It’s amazing that nearly 98 years on bottles are still being returned to the Marine Laboratory and in such fantastic condition. 'With many bottles still un-returned there is always the chance in the coming years that a Scottish drift bottle will once again break the record.' Dr Bill Turrell, Head of Marine Ecosystems with Marine Scotland Science, said: 'Drift bottles gave oceanographers at the start of the last century important information that allowed them to create pictures of the patterns of water circulation in the seas around Scotland. New world record: Mr Leaper said scoring two world records for the longest time a drift bottle has been known to spend at sea was 'like winning the lottery twice' 'These images were used to underpin further research, such as determining the drift of herring larvae from spawning grounds, which helped scientists understand the life cycle of this key species. 'The conclusions of these pioneering oceanographers were right in many respects, for example, they correctly deduced the clockwise flow of water around our coasts. 'However, it took the development of electronic instruments in the 1960s before the true patterns of current flows, and more importantly what causes them, were unlocked.'","Scottish skipper Andrew Leaper discovered drift bottle on same boat which recorded previous record-breaking bottle in 2006 .

"By . Jessica Satherley . UPDATED: . 12:11 EST, 22 November 2011 . A Bangladeshi student married a woman 22 years his senior to remain in Britain and then flew four more 'brides' into the UK to wed his friends in sham marriages, a court heard. After their own sham marriage, Mohamed Tanin, 25, and Maria Marques,  47, flew four Portuguese women to London to wed Tanin's Bangladeshi friends, who paid him £2,000 for each bride, it is alleged. Tanin’s UK leave to remain visa was about to expire three months before he married Marques at Bow Church in London on November 24, 2009. Facing charges: Maria Marques (left) and Mohammed Tanin (right) arriving at Snaresbrook Crown Court today on charges of arranging sham marriages . The ‘sham contract marriage’ was ‘not for love’ but a deal which allowed him to apply to live permanently within the UK and the rest of the European Union, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Tanin and Marques then arranged for four Portuguese women to fly into the country this summer, on an Easyjet flight paid for by Tanin, the court heard. Tanin, who arrived in the UK on a student visa in 2003, was paid up to £2,000 for each woman he brought into the country. But the planned weddings never took place, the court heard. Three of the grooms were tenants at a property Tanin owned in East London, while a fourth he met while working at London Zoo. Pleading not guilty: Marques denies entering into a 'sham marriage' The four men entered the country on student visas, which allow them to stay in the country for a limited time. All four applied for a certificate of approval to marry, which would allow them to get the same immigration status as their Portuguese wives. Three grooms lodged the paperwork for the approval to marriage certificates on the same day in July 2010, a mere week after their ‘brides’ arrived in the UK. Marques ‘knew or knew of’ all four of the Portuguese women, who she boasted to the would be grooms could ‘cook, clean and also marry you’. The jury heard all four grooms that admitted their role in the ‘conspiracy’, were cautioned and will now give evidence against Tanin and Marques. Paul Raudnitz, prosecuting, told the court Tanin paid 800 Euros (£690) to bring the women to the UK and Marques had flown to Lisbon to collect the women, even holding onto their passports and had helped arranged the paperwork in exchange for a fee. Mr Raudnitz said: ‘This case is about sham marriages - specifically sham marriages to allow for one of the spouses to become a permanent resident in the EU. ‘In each of the sham marriages the brides were Portuguese nationals and each of the ‘grooms’ were Bangladeshi. ‘I say grooms in inverted commas because none of the marriages ever took place.’ In all of the cases the males were Bangladeshi students who entered the UK on student visas and they became involved in the scam because they met Tanin either by being a tenant at a property he owned or by having worked with him. All four of the brides came to the UK on the same date, arriving at a flight from Lisbon to Luton on a flight paid for by Tanin, and on the flight were both Tanin and Marques. Wedding venue: Tanin, 25, married Marques, 47, at the Bow Church in London (pictured) on November 24, 2009 . Tanin and Marques provided assistance in the completion of the forms for approval to marriage and helped putting the affiliated documents together.’ Mr Raudnitz added three of the application forms were filed out on the same day and all three lied about how long the brides had been in the country. He said: ‘No one at the UK Border Agency would ever believe this was a legitimate marriage if the truth were told that the couple had never lived together and the brides had only arrived in the country a week before in the last week.’ He told the jury three 'grooms' attended the wedding of Marques and Tanin and one of the Bangladeshis told police he understood it to be a sham marriage. He added that Tanin had specifically asked one of his friends for money to enable him to go to Portugal and set up a business finding women for sham marriages. He said: ‘In June 2009 Mr Tanin asked for more money he was going to Portugal to set up a business making driving licences and was going to bring some more people back for contract marriages.’ The pair denies one count of entering into a marriage which facilitated the commission of a breach of immigration law by an individual who was not a citizen of the EU. Tanin and Marques, both of Poplar, East London, also face four counts of conspiracy to assist in the unlawful immigration to an EU member state. The case continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Mohamed Tanin, 25, married Maria Marques, 47, three months before the Bangladeshi student's leave to remain visa was about to expire .

"By . Chris Brooke . UPDATED: . 20:26 EST, 23 November 2011 . Sabir Hussain was jailed for 10 weeks at Bradford Magistrates' Court yesterday after admitting assaulting pupils . An islamic teacher was jailed yesterday after being caught on a hidden camera kicking and hitting children during religious lessons in a mosque. Sabir Hussain, 60, stood over the young boys as they sat on the floor and was secretly filmed kicking three in the back and repeatedly hitting one youngster forcefully with the back of his hand. The ‘fearful’ boys, aged between ten and 13, could be seen flinching from the teacher, who was giving classes for Muslim pupils in reading the Koran at the Markazi Jamia Mosque, in Keighley, West Yorkshire. He was exposed by the Channel 4 documentary Dispatches, in its programme Lessons In Hatred And Violence, which was broadcast in February and included footage of him assaulting some of the 19 boys. Wearing traditional Islamic clothing, Hussain, at the time a voluntary teacher, can be seen walking around the class as the boys sat on the floor. He is seen using considerable force to hit a child four times with the back of his hand as the boy cowers in fear. Another sequence shows him kicking a boy in the back and then slapping him on the head. Two other sections of video catch Hussain kicking boys in the back. Hussain admitted four charges of assaulting boys in December last year and was yesterday  jailed for ten weeks. He was originally charged with ten counts of assault, but the  prosecution accepted his four guilty pleas. The footage shows Hussain aggressively pulling a pupil towards him as he strikes the boy's back at Markazi Jamia Mosque . Learning by example, these teenagers who were put in charge during a teacher's absence threatens a younger pupil . Bradford magistrates were told the . camera was recording in the mosque over a five-month period. District . Judge Susan Bouch rejected pleas by his barrister to spare him a . custodial sentence. Shufqat Khan, defending, described him as a ‘pillar of  the community’ known for being ‘firm but fair’. But the judge, commenting on the victims, said: ‘They are small, vulnerable and they are young.’ She told Hussain: ‘It can clearly be seen on the footage  that the children are flinching  away from you. ‘That suggests clearly to me that the children were fearful. You are in a position of responsibility. This is a gross breach of trust.  All of these factors make the offences so serious I can only pass a term of imprisonment.’ A child receives a sharp blow to the back of the head from Hussain. The blow was audible in the footage . Another child is grabbed by the wrist and pulled violently towards Hussain who raises his other hand and strikes the pupil on the back . Hussain, of Keighley, came to Britain . in 1967 and spent nearly 40 years as a textile worker. He required an . interpreter in court. An application to release him on bail pending an appeal was rejected by the judge. After the case a statement from West . Yorkshire Police and Children’s Services at Bradford Council welcomed . the sentence but criticised the TV team for not reporting the offences . earlier, saying: ‘Some of these assaults would have been avoidable.’ However Ann Cryer, the former MP for Keighley, praised the  documentary team. She said: ‘This violence against children was going on under the nose of the mosque authorities.’","Sabir Hussain was arrested after footage was screened on a Channel 4 documentary earlier this year .

A German shoe firm is having problems shipping its products to customers in America, and it's founder thinks it's all down to its name - Atheist. About half the shipments of Atheist shoes to the God-fearing U.S. have been beset by lengthy delays, and the company suspects it could be because of the prominent branding on the boxes. The company has enjoyed massive success across the world over the past year selling its shoes, which proclaim 'I'm an atheist' or 'Darwin Loves' on their soles. Lost in the post: Shoe company Atheist says about half its shipments to the God-fearing U.S. have been beset by delays, and the company suspects it could be because of the prominent branding on the boxes . But now it seems the believers are hitting back, in the U.S. at least. Dublin-born company founder David Bonney told Swedish news site The Local: 'About half our shipments to the U.S. have seen lengthy delays. 'We accept that the odd delay and even the occasional disappearance are bound to happen. But the problem did get significantly worse for us last autumn, which happened to be when we started using ATHEIST-branded tape.' Mr Bonney, 34, said that he believed that it was the prominent placing of the word 'Atheist' on the outside of their packaging that was attracting the ire of American postal workers. Around 75 per cent of Americans identify themselves as Christians, according to recent surveys, compared to just 15-20 per cent who express no religious affiliation. Those numbers are practically reversed in Atheist shoes' home town of Berlin, where roughly two-thirds of the population believe there is no God. In order to test Mr Bonney's theory, . the Atheist team decided to conduct an experiment. They sent 89 . customers two packages: one sealed with Atheist-branded tape, the other . with neutral tape. All the . packages were sent from Berlin on the same day, but the Atheist-branded . packages took an average of three days longer to reach their . destinations. Not only that, . but while just one unbranded package went missing in the post, a . stunning nine Atheist-branded packages disappeared on route to their . intended recipient. Unholy soles: The company's shoes include such slogans as 'ich bin atheist' and 'Darwin Loves' The company wrote in its website: 'Having run a series of control tests in Germany and Europe, which demonstrate no such bias, the problem appears to lie in the USA and is likely explained by the differential handling of packages by employees of the U.S. Postal Service. 'Interestingly, this seems to be a national problem - traditionally less religious and more liberal states also saw high delay and disappearance. 'Sadly many of our customers who took part in this experiment were not surprised by our findings, even though tampering with post is a Federal offence.' Mr Bonney said he believes the company may have lost as many as 25 shipments on their way to American customers. Asked what he thinks happens to them, he said: 'God knows. Maybe it is truly divine intervention.' To forestall any further acts of God, Atheist shoes have since ceased using their branded tape on packages sent to the U.S.","Company claims about half its shipments to U.S. have been beset by delays .

It was a role that catapulted her to stardom but Elaine Paige has revealed it was not her voice alone that helped her secure the part of Eva Peron. The singer and actress has confessed it was her ‘hooker’ shoes that paved the way for her to be chosen to play Evita in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical. She auditioned for the lead role 13 times and made sure she wore the same heeled shoes complete with an ankle strap in green each time. After Miss Paige won the part she was told by Harold Prince, the US theatre producer of the show: ‘I always remembered you. Every time you walked on, I saw those shoes. Like, here she comes, here come the f*** me shoes’. The multi-millionaire composer’s 1978 show proved to be a breakthrough for Miss Paige who was 30 at the time and saw her billed as ‘the first lady of British musical theatre’. She went on to win roles in Cats, Sunset Boulevard, Chess and The King and I. Success however was not easy for Miss Paige, tired of the endless round of auditions and rejections, a year before she landed Evita, Miss Paige had toyed with the idea of giving up her career as an actress and retraining as a nursery nurse. Sharing her secrets with musical theatre students at the Haymarket in London earlier this week, Miss Paige, 65, told them it was important to standout and to be determined: ‘I have spent my life going to auditions and there always a million other people going for the same role. ‘You can be the most talented person in the world but if you have not anything about you or the way you walk on, something distinctive then you won’t stand out. ‘When I first auditioned for Evita, and I must have had about 12 auditions after that, I wore the same 1940s’ frock and the same ‘hooker’ shoes with an ankle strap in green. 'I wore a pale blue skirt and green shoes. Every time I went back I wore the same thing. After I got the part Harold Prince (US theatre producer) said to me, “I always remembered you. Every time you walked on I saw those shoes. Like, here she comes, here come the f*** me shoes”. Behind the scenes: Singer Elaine Paige shares a joke with director Harold Prince during rehearsals for Evita . Colleagues: Harold Prince, right, told Elaine Paige that her shoes helped her win a role in Andrew Lloyd Webber's (left) musical . ‘Talent is not enough so my shoes helped. ‘Theatre is a young man’s game, you have got to have loads of energy, vitality and stamina to play eight shows a week. And the same with the auditions, you have to have to have a definite reason to be there.’ Miss Paige not only made headlines for her performances in Evita but also for her public affair with the musical’s lyricist Tim Rice. Star turn: Miss Paige as Evita . It lasted for 11 years and they were openly a couple, even though Rice was married to Jane McIntosh, the daughter of an Army colonel and had two children. And it is not just fledgling performers who have benefited from Miss Paige’s wealth of experience. The star revealed she has also passed on tips to Oscar-winning actress Helen Mirren who is currently starring in a play about The Queen called the Audience in London’s West End. She said: ‘After the performance she told me that she felt as if her voice was being strained and I said to her “I suppose you are remembering to breathe?” 'And she just went “Oh”. I think because she has done to much film work that she is not used to projecting her voice. I think she had forgotten to breathe properly and you do have to do that. ‘I have got a stomach like a boxers because I have practiced and practiced it. It is very firm. ‘I went to go and see the new West End show Once The Musical last week. ‘It was a wonderful show but I could not understand a word they were on about. It is all about the importance of speaking. Projection and diction are important.’ Miss Paige attended the Aida Foster stage school, making her first professional appearance on stage in 1964, at the age of 16. In 1985, she released “I Know him so well with Barbara Dickson from the musical Chess, which it is understood remains the biggest-selling record by a female duo.","Miss Paige made sure she wore the same heels for all 13 auditions .

His sharply tailored designer suits are chosen with the greatest of care and his stylish wife rarely puts a fashionable foot out of place. But when it comes to outfitting his children, Nick Clegg has a rather more cheap and cheerful approach. He just pops in to Primark and Matalan. He told listeners on his radio phone-in programme: ‘You’ve got three kids in tow on a Saturday afternoon. You rush in, you rush out . . . You go to the most convenient shop, you buy what’s affordable, as a parent you try and get what you can in an affordable way for your kids.’ Nick Clegg claimed his family often shop in Primark and Matalan. At last year's Lib Dem conference his wife Miriam Gonzales Durantez arrived wearing a white £390 dress by Scottish designer Henrietta Ludgate and orange shoes are from Zara . In 2010 Miriam González Durántez was pictured leaving expensive lingerie shop Rigby & Peller . Mr Clegg, who lives in South-West London with his wife Miriam and three sons, also recently told listeners to his weekly LBC Radio show that he buys his underwear in Marks & Spencer. It was in the run-up to the 2010 general election that interviewers first noticed Mr Clegg’s sharp new look, which owed a great deal to suits from designer Paul Smith, with prices starting at £615. Last autumn Miriam Clegg turned heads at the Lib Dem conference in a £390 made-to-order white dress by Scottish designer Henrietta Ludgate, matched with orange stilettos from High Street label Zara. The Lib Dem leader’s comments on his shopping habits came in the aftermath of the  factory tragedy in Bangladesh. At least 386 people died and hundreds were injured when the building collapsed. The factory supplied clothing to Primark, one of Britain’s biggest budget retailers. Clearing the rubble: Workers use heavy machinery to clear the wreckage of the eight-storey Rana Plaza in in Bangladesh, where the death toll is expected to leap as high as 1,400 as they discover bodies trapped inside the Primark factory . Bosses at high street giant Primark have said they will pay compensation to the families of their workers involved in the Bangladesh building collapse . A listener emailed Mr Clegg’s radio show to ask if the Government could ‘put more pressure on British companies to avoid tragedies like the one in Bangladesh’. He was also asked if he shopped at budget stores. He replied: ‘Like any consumer you shop around and often you don’t think about how something’s produced . . . I’m not  pretending our shopping choices are done on some sort of moral calculator, far from it. We’re like any other people.’ But Mr Clegg said consumers had more power than they thought to effect change by  paying more for products made in safe conditions. He said: ‘I was interested to see in the wake of this catastrophe . . . quite a lot of people in the retail sector were coming forward on the telly saying actually for only a little bit of extra money you can buy an assurance that it’s produced more sustainably. ‘There’s more we could do to talk about what goes on behind the scenes and this terrible catastrophe might well prompt people to think again.’ Have you seen Nick Clegg in Primark?

A jobless man set himself on fire in Tunisia today in a gesture recalling the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, whose death ignited a revolt that shook the Arab world. Security forces and bystanders in Tunis tried to extinguish the flames before the man was rushed to hospital, witnesses said. 'He is in very critical condition,' a medical source in Mourouj hospital said, but gave no further details. The body of a young Tunisian man, who set himself on fire, is seen at the main street of the capital Tunis . The man doused himself with gasoline and self fire to himself, reviving memories of the self-immolation that helped spark the Arab Spring uprisings . The incident occurred hours before Prime Minister-designate Ali Larayedh was due to seek a confidence vote for his new Islamist-led government from the National Constituent Assembly. The man burned himself outside the municipal theatre in the capital's main Habib Bourguiba Avenue, the focus for protests that toppled President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali two years ago. An Interior Ministry official did not name the victim, but said he was aged 27, hailed from the north-western city of Jandouba and had been looking for a job for a long time. Tunisia's unemployment rate stands at about 17 per cent, with graduates forming a large proportion of the jobless total. Several Tunisians have set themselves ablaze in the past two years in protests emulating that of Bouazizi, a street vendor who torched himself on December 17, 2010, in the town of Sidi Bouzid after a policewoman confiscated his fruit cart. Bouazizi's death sparked protests that ended with Ben Ali's overthrow and inspired rebellions elsewhere in the Middle East. The man is believed to be from a poor town in northwestern Tunisia. He is in a critical condition . Witnesses said security forces and bystanders tried to extinguish the flames before the man was rushed to hospital . The incident happened outside the municipal theatre in the capital's main Habib Bourguiba Avenue . Several Tunisians have set themselves ablaze in the past two years in protests emulating that of Bouazizi . The economic and social problems that fuelled Tunisia's uprising have yet to be solved in a country now deeply polarised between Islamists and their opponents and still awaiting a new constitution to advance a transition from autocracy. The last government, led by Hamadi Jebali, collapsed after the premier's own moderate Islamist Ennahda party rejected his plan for a technocrat cabinet to lead Tunisia to elections. Jebali had proposed this as a way to calm unrest over the assassination on February 6 of secular opposition leader Chokri Belaid by what the authorities say was a group of Salafi Islamist militants, four of whom have been arrested. Larayedh, who was Interior Minister under Jebali, has named independents to take several key portfolios, but failed to bring additional secular parties into the Ennahda-led coalition. The political crisis has delayed talks with the International Monetary Fund on a $1.78billion loan.","Man, believed to be aged 27, stages fiery protest in middle of Tunis .

Three human skeletons discovered in a hole dug for a septic tank in Oklahoma last month are most likely those of three females we went missing in 1992 authorities have announced. Grover J. Prewitt Jr., 60, of Bristow was arrested on Thursday after having admitted to police of having sprinkled black pepper over the grave to mask any odor, but under the direction of his mother he claims. The bodies are likely Wendy Camp, 23; her daughter Cynthia Britto, 6; and Lisa Kregear, 22, who was Camp's sister-in-law, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said. Missing: From left Wendy Camp, 23, her daughter Cynthia Britto, 6, and Lisa Kregear, 22, are pictured after vanishing on May 29 of 1992 . Clothing, a backpack and a purse were found in the 8-feet-deep hole near Jennings, matching items the women had when they disappeared on May 29 of 1992. Prewitt used to own the land where the bodies were found and was charged with being an accessory after the fact of first-degree murder. Investigators said he told them that he suspected in 1992 that the three were in the hole and said he spread pepper in the area at his mother's request. Prewitt's mother, Ida Prewitt who died in September of 2011, was in a bitter custody battle with Camp at the time of her disappearance having been married to Prewitt's nephew, according to investigators. In late March, Grover Prewitt told investigators that, around the time the three disappeared, his sister Beverly Noe asked him to hire a backhoe driver to dig a hole for a septic tank on 5 acres that their mother was buying from him. Accessory: Grover J. Prewitt Jr., 60, of Bristow, told police his mother Ida Prewitt, right, ordered him to dig the hole for a septic tank where the bodies were later found . The hole sat empty for a bit, then after the three went missing his mother asked him to have the backhoe driver fill the hole. Ida Prewitt never moved onto the property and later sold it. 'Grover never looked in the hole after the girls went missing because he was scared of what he would see,' agent Melissa Gann wrote in an affidavit filed in Creek County Court. Investigators have since accused Noe of being the last to have seen the three victims after driving them to Walmart. 'I never hurt nobody,' Noe told KFOR. 'I took ‘em to the Walmart. I’ll say that to my dying days.' Five days after his initial meeting with police, Prewitt met again with investigators and told one 'he really needed to look in that hole.' On April 16, crews found three bodies inside. In an interview with police on April 22, he recalled his mother asking him to sprinkle black pepper on the area. Scene: The remains were found on this private property in Pawnee County last month in an 8-foot hole that Grover Prewitt says his mother told him to sprinkle black pepper over to mask any odor . 'He told her he thought that was ""awful damn strange."" She said it would ""deter dog scents."" Grover did not question her on that matter and did as he was asked,' Gann wrote.

The OSBI wouldn't speculate on why Grover Prewitt stepped forward now. 'After 21 years, a lot changes in people's lives,' OSBI spokeswoman Jessica Brown said. Creek County officials did not have a record of any attorney for Prewitt. DNA testing is pending to determine definitely whether the bodies are those of the missing women and the girl. 'Now that it is open and out in the public, we need people to come forward,' she said. 'There are other people who know about this.' At a news conference Thursday, OSBI Director Stan Florence credited Prewitt's recent revelations – at the same time agents were moving in to arrest him. 'The passage of 21 years gave a tipster confidence to come forward and provide the information necessary to help push this case forward,' Florence said at the time. According to the investigators, Camp's son, 4-year-old Jonathan Noe, lived with Chad Noe in Shamrock.

A scandal-hit councillor who was once the highest-paid in the UK has courted controversy once again by claiming to have slept with an Arsenal footballer. Brian Coleman, who calls himself the 'King of Bling', made the surprising statement in a post on his blog about an unrelated subject. He did not give any hint as to who the player might have been, other than saying he was a striker. Claim: Brian Coleman wrote on his blog last week that he 'once slept with an Arsenal striker' Mr Coleman, 51, serves as an independent on Barnet Council in North London, and used to be the borough's mayor. He is a former Conservative, but was suspended by the party after he was arrested for allegedly assaulting a woman who tried to photograph him. As a member of the London Assembly who was chairman of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, Mr Coleman was paid £130,000, more than any other local official in the country. His unusual claim about his sex life came in a blog post last week about Barnet FC's plans to move stadiums. Mr Coleman, who is openly gay, . wrote: 'For someone who has little interest in Football, although I did . attend Barnet v Port Vale at Underhill a couple of years ago, and once . slept  with an Arsenal striker, I am not fussed if Barnet survive in the . Football League or bothered where they play.' It is unclear when the incident allegedly took place, or who the footballer was. When contacted today, the councillor refused to reveal the identity of the player. Blog: The controversial Brent councillor calls himself 'The King of Bling' on his personal website . Homosexuality in football is currently a hot topic due to the very small number of openly gay players - only three professionals are believed to have come out during their careers. Mr Coleman previously made headlines with a claim that former Prime Minister Ted Heath was told off as a junior MP for 'cottaging' for anonymous gay sex. Despite the revelation about his sporty former lover, the councillor has previously insisted that he 'does not discuss his private life with anybody'. Mr Coleman, who lost his London Assembly seat last year, is currently awaiting trial on charges of assault by beating and driving without reasonable care. He is accused of attacking a cafe owner after she tried to photograph him parking in a restricted zone. Following his arrest in September he was suspended by the Conservative Party and stripped of his place on a number of council committees.","Brian Coleman, former mayor of Barnet, posts claim about sex life .

The mammoth mutt, who is so overweight he needs to wear a harness to stop his body dragging on the ground, was temporarily adopted by former veterinary technician Nora Vanatta after his elderly owners almost fed him to death. But Oregon Dachshund Rescue owner Jenell Rangan has accused the woman of exploiting the dog for 'sensationalistic promotional value' and is fighting for custody. Scroll down for Obie video . Custody: Obie the obese Dachshund, pictured, who found fame last month after tipping the scales at 77 pounds is in the midst of a bitter custody battle . Obie became a nationwide celebrity after appearing on TV shows such as 'Live With Kelly and Michael' and the Today Show with Ms Vanatta, who put him on a drastic diet. A Facebook page that chronicles his weight loss now has more than 67,000 followers. But the rescue centre claims to be Obie's owner and in court papers filed on October 22 accuses Ms Vanatta of 'wrongfully' holding the dog in an effort to get famous and pocket the donations that are flowing in to help pay for his care. 'They say I'm exploiting him,' Ms Vanatta told KATU.com. 'They say I'm misusing his funds and they claim he belongs to them.' Exploitation: Nora Vanatta, pictured, is being accused of exploiting the dog for 'sensationalistic promotional value' Battle: Oregon Dachshund Rescue owner Jenell Rangan, pictured left, is fighting to take Obie from Ms Vanatta, right . The woman has collected thousands of dollars from Obie's supporters. But she insists that everything she's done for the dog in the past two months that he's been in her care is beneficial. Obie has already shed 15 pounds, she said, and her goal is to have him slim down by 40 pounds. 'The money just sits there because he may need to have surgery to have his excess skin removed,' Ms Vanatta said. 'You know, we just don't know where, what he's really going to need.' Oregon Dachshund Rescue put out an online plea for help when they heard the dog was in need of a home.

Vanata put him on a drastic diet to try and get him back into shape. Obie, . who is double the size of an average Dachshund, was nearly fed to death . by his doting elderly owners who had to give him up because of their . deteriorating health. A Dachshund normally has a maximum weight of 32 pounds - a little over two stone - with Obie more than twice the size at the age of just five. Dieting: Obie, aged five, has now been taken in by vet Nora Vanetta in Portland, Oregon, who is determined to get him back in shape . Counting calories: As Obie is too big to exercise, he has been put on a special diet and hydrotherapy regime . Beach time: Ms Vanatta said the pooch has already lost 15 pounds . Ms Vanatta said: 'He arrived on August 18 and to my astonishment he was a dachshund and he actually weighed 77 lbs. 'He is extremely sweet and loving. He . was obviously loved and is a joy to work with. The aging owners just . couldn't say no to those big brown eyes. 'But we are thrilled to be able to help him, and now moving on with his new life.' Ms Vanatta, . who has a degree in animal science and is a certified veterinary . technician, said the dog's staggering weight meant she was unable to take him out for exercise. Instead, she resorted to a special diet and hydrotherapy in an attempt to shed the pounds. She wants to get the sausage dog down to between 30 and 40 pounds. Winner: A judge will decide on Monday who gets to keep the mammoth mutt . Working out: Obie has a Facebook page, Biggest Loser, Doxie Edition, where people can track his progress . Tipping the scales: Obie is double the size of most Dachshunds that normally have a maximum weight of 32 pounds . Ms Vanatta set up a Paypal page to encourage people to donate money to pay for Obie's care and the donations have been flowing in. When she embarked on the project, she said: 'I feel tremendously blessed to be involved in his rehabilitation and I am amazed at the outpouring of love and support that I have received.

Lisa Simmons, 51, was looking for sour oranges in the woods in Flagler County, Florida in April last year as her boyfriend sought out hogs when she was knocked to the ground in pain.

Serial sex offender Stuart Hall has been accused of giving his mansion to his wife to protect his fortune from compensation claims made by his victims. The former It’s A Knockout presenter is being sued by at least six women in relation to harm and injuries they suffered at his hands. But the Daily Mail can reveal that in the weeks before he admitted his guilty plea the 83-year-old transferred the ownership of his £2million Cheshire mansion into the name of his wife. Last night it was claimed the move could be an example of ‘asset stripping’ by the broadcaster to stop his victims from making claims against his fortune. Alan Collins, a solicitor from Pannone is representing more than 50 victims of Jimmy Savile in their compensation claims against his estate and the BBC. He is now representing six of Hall’s victims who want to sue him for compensation. Mr Collins is also considering taking action against the BBC on their behalf. He said: ‘Hall’s admission of guilt means we will be able to pursue these cases expeditiously on behalf of our clients. ‘Victims often live with the memories of the abuse hidden away at the back of their minds for years and it is particularly brave of such victims to come forward and face those memories.’ But he condemned the fact Hall had transferred the ownership of his home before his admission of guilt. Mr Collins said: ‘We see this kind of cynical move all the time, it’s really horrible. It is hugely problematic and it often happens in this sort of case. ‘Victims have enough on their plate already having to deal with such a horrible personal tragedy and a criminal court case. Home: Hall has been registered as the joint owner of his red brick mansion in Wilmslow with his wife Hazel, 75, since at least 1981 . ‘Then when they try to get their little bit of justice in the civil courts they find they are getting a second dose of injustice.’ Hall has been registered as the joint owner of his red brick mansion in Wilmslow with his wife Hazel, 75, since at least 1981. But his name was removed from the title for the property registered at the Land Registry on February 22, 2013 making Hazel the sole owner. There is no mortgage listed on the property. Only two weeks earlier Hall had protested his innocence to the allegations of sexual assault on the steps of Preston Crown Court. Sign over: Hall pictured with his wife in 1979 . Then, just weeks after safely moving his property into the name of his wife, Hall changed his plea and said he was guilty of indecently assaulting 13 girls. Mr Collins warned the change in ownership will make it difficult for his victims to make a financial claim against Hall because there is no guarantee he will be able to pay any compensation awarded. He said: ‘Very often we find houses being transferred, moneys being sent overseas, you name it and it’s done. It’s then very difficult to unravel because quite often we have to go to the High Court to get a freezing order to stop it. 'The victims will have to convince a judge the money has been transferred simply to defeat a civil claim.’ He also warned there was very little victims could do to stop their abuser from securing their financial position until they have been found guilty in a criminal court. He said: ‘Victims are prevented from taking any action to protect their own positions because it might compromise any prosecution. 'A common defence practice in criminal trials is of the defence to accuse the victim of making up allegations to try to get “at my client’s money”. ‘Mr Abuser can often be given advice telling him that if he goes down he is probably going to get sued by the victims therefore it might be a good idea to “arrange your affairs”. ‘In this case the victims have a cast iron case to bring against Stuart Hall but if he has transferred all his assets he will turn around and say “sorry, but I can’t pay you”.’ Liz Dux of Slater & Gordon is representing another 50 victims of Savile in their claims for compensation against his estate and the BBC. Admission: Hall pictured outside court yesterday . She said moving the ownership of a property into the name of a spouse makes it less attractive for solicitors to want to take up a civil claim. She added: ‘If someone is suing a litigant in person it is normal that you would look into their means before you would make a decision whether or not to prosecute. ‘You have to make a very practical decision because whilst you might win you might never be able to enforce the judgement.’ According to friends, Hall’s wife of 55 years, Hazel, is standing ‘rock solid’ behind him. They say she is determined to protect her two children Francesca, 52, and Danny, 50, and their four grandchildren. A source said: ‘It’s been tough on everyone but the family are being very supportive of him.’ In his biography Hall claims it was Hazel who ‘fell for’ their home in Wilmslow and he ‘arranged a purchase on the spot’. Hall’s lawyers last night failed to respond to inquiries from the Mail about the home ownership transfer.","Shamed presenter handed over Cheshire mansion to wife Hazel .

Laine Henry came to the defense of his wife Caren after the 50-pound Labrador retriever mix  launched at her as they enjoyed a stroll with their pet beagle in Madrid, Iowa on Sunday. The black-and-white animal, which had bounded out from a nearby yard, sunk its teeth into the woman's right thigh, before biting her stomach and going for her face. She recalled how it scratched at her eyes and broke her sunglasses - which she believes saves her sight - before clamping down on her nose and ripping it from her face. Scroll down for video . Protective: Laine Henry, right, bit a dog's nose to make it stop attacking his wife Caren on Sunday . The dog then turned its attack on the couple's pet, biting the animal's side. Mr Henry lunged for the dogs and tried to pry the Labrador retriever's jaws open so that it would drop the beagle, and the dog bit Mr Henry's arm. Again, it would not let go. In a bizarre move, Mr Henry then bit down on the dog's nose - forcing the animal to release its jaws, the couple told the Des Moines Register. The Henrys jumped in their truck and drove to Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines. Mr Henry suffered a dog bite to his arm, which became infected, and received treatment. Quick thinking: After the out-of-control dog tore off Mrs Henry's nose, it started attacking the couple's own dog and Mr Henry had to bite the animal on its nose so that it would stop . Recovering: Caren Henry has undergone one surgery but will need many more to rebuild her nose . But there's a longer road ahead for his wife, who has already undergone one surgery. Doctors will use skin from her forehead and elsewhere and cartilage from her ear to rebuild her nose. 'We took pictures at the hospital, and . it was the most grotesque things I've ever seen,' the family's attorney Ryan Beattie told the Register. 'There's . just a hole where a nose should be.' But speaking from her hospital bed, Mrs Henry managed to stay upbeat. 'It could have been so much worse,' she said. 'If I hadn't been wearing my sunglasses, I'm sure I would be missing an eye. If it had gotten hold of my throat, I'd be dead.' Attacked: The couple had been walking with their beagle, pictured, when the other dog attacked . Visitor: Their pet, who was not badly injured in the attack, visited his owners in hospital, pictured . The Henrys' dog recovered from the attack and has even visited his owners in hospital. But the other dog is under quarantine as authorities try to determine who is responsible for it. The county does not have a vicious dog ordinance that would seek charges for the dog's owner and potentially lead to the animal being put down, the Register reported. The animal will be under quarantine for six weeks and then released to its owner. It is currently staying at the home from where it was seen running. Unprovoked attack: The Labrador retriever mix is now in quarantine but will not be put down (file picture) The man looking after the animal, Marcus Johnson, said it belongs to a local homeless man, Thomas Goodson, but said he occasionally takes the dog in to feed him. He claimed that the dog does not stay with him on a regular basis, which neighbors disputed. The Henrys said they had a lucky escape and fear what the threat the animal poses. 'I just can't imagine if this dog had gotten ahold of a little kid,' Mrs Henry said. 'It's just scary that this dog is on the loose.'

Most parents boast that their child is bright. But the parents of Sherwyn Sarabi would be right in singing their son's praises - he can already count to 200 and name every country in the world at just three years old. Sherwyn's IQ score of 136 puts him in the top one per cent of the world's population ranked in order of intelligence. And the lad from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, has now become one of the youngest members of Mensa. Sherwyn, who has a reading age of six, began speaking at the age of 10 months and was talking in sentences at 20 months. By the age of two, Sherwyn could read, count to 200, recognise and name countries, flags, planets in the solar system, parts of the body and internal organs. His mother, Amanda Sarabi, said she was really proud of her gifted son, who she described as 'amazing'. Mrs Sarabi, 36, a former teacher, said her son could point out every country in the world on a globe and match it to its flag. He could also explain the function of each internal organ. She said: 'His general knowledge is amazing. He knows about everything. It’s not like talking to a three-year-old. 'He doesn’t even watch children’s programmes, he watches the news. 'The weather is his favourite, especially the world weather. He loves that.' Boys to Mensa: The youngster was already naming planets and internal organs by the age of two . Early learner: The three-year-old attends the Rastrick Independent School, in Brighouse, West Yorkshire . Sherwyn with his headteacher Susan Vaughey . She added: 'We take every day as it comes. I’ve never forced teaching anything on to him. 'If he comes to me and asks me about a topic, I teach him to the best of my knowledge. Sometimes I have to look it up because I don’t know the answer but I explain it to him, then he’s happy.' Mrs Sarabi said she and her husband, Davoud, 37, who was studying construction management until he was involved in an accident, are well-educated but 'nothing extraordinary'. She said they first noticed Sherwyn's interest in learning when he was 18 months old but his intelligence seemed normal to them until other people pointed out how unusual it was. After his third birthday, Sherwyn was tested on the Wechsler Pre-School and Primary Scale of Intelligence, which placed him in the 99th percentile with an IQ of 136.

Enormous hair ties, wiggly hair, bootleg jeans and overalls may be largely absend from the 21st century world of fashion.... but maybe not for long. Women are itching for a range of sartorial antiques we thought had been banished into the crypts of time to return to their wardrobes - and it seems boundary-nudging celebrities such as Victoria Beckham and Demi Lovato are to blame. Flares, dungarees, crimped hair and even the dreaded scrunchie are the items of fashion paraphernalia females in the UK would most like to see make a comeback, according to research. Victoria Beckham is often seen looking well-groomed in flares, and now it seems that British women want to wear them as well, as they were voted the top trend females most wish would return . Jessica Alba sported flares when she and husband Cash Warren went walkabout in Los Angeles recently . The return most longed for is flared trousers (51 per cent), with expansive hair ties coming second (49 per cent) and body . suits third (47 per cent), according to the poll by myvouchercodes.co.uk. Overalls (42 per cent), crimped hair (38 per cent) and ruffled shirts (35 per cent) and even choker necklaces (16 per cent) also make the top ten. While the idea of these trends returning may make many of us red-faced at memories of fashion mistakes past, we should be prepared for them to be even bigger the second time around. A third of women said they would be more likely to wear something the second or third time it came back into fashion. Some of the trends may have been inspired by celebrities reviving them. Style queen Victoria Beckham is a lover of flared jeans and has been seen out and about in them recently looking her usual chic self. Alessandra Ambrosio (left) and Lindsay Lohan, right, have both been seen recently opting for the low key trend . Lindsay Lohan, Alessandra Ambrosio and Jessica Alba have also embraced flared trousers, perhaps for their ability to balance hips and make you appear slimmer. Large hair ties have also started to creep back onto red carpets, with Katy Perry, Demi Lovato and model Petra Nemcova all seen sporting them. Over half of respondents confessed . themselves more willing to try trends if they noticed celebrities were wearing them (57 per cent), while a quarter . admitted celebrity endorsement played a factor in their . purchasing decisions. Teen star Demi Lovato rocked a statement scrunchy at the Teen Choice Awards last year, and now British women want to see them back in the shops . Celebrities like Katy Perry (left) and Petra Nemcova (right) may be the reason why we now aspire to pull off the scrunchie, as the majority of women admit stars influence trends they chose to follow . However, . the fear of the return of trends like the all-in-one body suit and . crimped hair are certainly not unfounded, as it is doubtful all of us . will look as good as the celebrities we follow. 1.    Flares – 51% . 2.    Big hair scrunchies – 49% . 3.    Bodysuits – 47% . 4.    Overalls – 42% . 5.    Crimped hair – 38% . 6.    Ruffled shirts – 35% . 7.    Bright tie dye – 29% . 8.    Bandanas as headbands – 26% . 9.    Zig Zag hair parting – 23% . 10.    Chokers – 16% . When asked whether or not they have worn trends in the past that did not suit their body shape or that they did not even like, simply because they were 'in fashion', a massive 65 per cent admitted that they had. Mark Pearson, Chairman of MyVoucherCodes.co.uk, said: 'It comes as a bit of a surprise to see how many women chose flared jeans as the top trend they would like to see make a comeback. With the latest pictures of Victoria Beckham wearing flares, it is pretty easy to see why.' He continued: 'Like all fads and trends, it is important to invest in high quality pieces that are timeless and are easily integrated with your wardrobe. 'Nothing is worse than spending money on trendy pieces that are only worn once or not at all. 'Be sure to pick trends that will add a bit of style to your normal routine. Wasting money on fashions that will only be given away or donated is not money well spent! Don't be afraid to hunt around for the best deals.'","Half of British women want to see the return of flared trousers .

Bode Miller's ex-lover has claimed the Olympic skier said he wanted a large family with her - before she fell pregnant and he told her to have an abortion. Sara McKenna, 27, gave birth to their son  Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna earlier this year following a three month courtship and moved from San Diego to New York to attend Columbia University. But after initially saying he wanted her to have an abortion, Miller, 35, is now fighting her for joint custody, and a judge ruled she must return to California for the battle, which forces her to give up her studies. McKenna, a former Marine and firefighter, revealed that they only had sex twice - and that he failed to use protection as he assumed she was ready to get pregnant, she said. 'You have to agree to have four of my babies,' Miller texted McKenna, she told the New York Daily News, after they met on a high-priced dating service. After they met up in California, they went their separate ways, and she said he was reluctant to continue a relationship because he wanted a large family, and she did not. But a few weeks later, they organized to meet up in Florida - and a second tryst led to her falling pregnant with baby Samuel. Newlywed: Bode Miller married Morgan Beck in October 2012 (the couple at the Kentucky Derby in May). They were expected a child but in January Beck suffered a miscarriage . 'He never offered to use a condom,' McKenna said. 'He assumed I was ready to get pregnant.' After she fell pregnant, she moved to New York - and Miller married volleyball player Morgan Beck. McKenna said that she is a devout . Catholic and has alleged that Miller wanted nothing to do with the . pregnancy and even encouraged her to have an abortion. Beck and Miller married in October 2012 and announced they were expecting a child, but Beck suffered a miscarriage in January. Days after the devastating . news, Miller filed court documents to gain joint custody of his son with . McKenna, the child he has never met. McKenna, left and right, dated Bode Miller for 3 . months in 2012 when she lived in San Diego. On her Twitter profile she . says she is a 'firefighter, helicopter pilot, former U.S. Marine, model, . Ivy leaguer, and mommy' Baby Bode: McKenna moved to New York while she was pregnant - but now must return to California . Miller sought to force a . judge to get McKenna to move back to California, so he can have . relationship with the child. He has also sought to have the boy's last name changed to Miller, on his birth certificate. Earlier this month McKenna appeared . in Manhattan Family Court as Miller's lawyers argued that the custody . case for the pair's infant son should be moved to California, a state . with more generous custody rights, where the skier lives. McKenna, told the New York Post that she was already $35,000 in debt from legal bills. 'I can’t afford to be flying back and forth to California,' she said. Manhattan Family Court referee . Fiordaliza Rodriguez ruled yesterday that McKenna’s 'appropriation of a . child while in utero was irresponsible and reprehensible.' Devastated: Bode Miller, with his volleyball star wife Morgan Beck, was devastated after the couple lost the child in January . Lawyer's for the Olymipian told a judge earlier this month: 'New York is an inconvenient forum.' 'Why . did she make a very precipitous decision to apply to a college 3,000 . miles away?' the athlete’s attorney, Barbara Schaffer said. 'It’s no secret New York does not have a presumption as California does of joint custody.' The lawyer representing McKenna said that it is too late for Miller to try to seek joint custody. 'If . you look at the texts [messages] from Bode Miller to my client, he . wanted nothing to do with the baby,' attorney Kenneth Eiges said. Her lawyer also defended his client's right to live in New York saying it was 'her right.' Previously, McKenna tried to block Miller's attempts at custody, claiming in a court filing that the famed Olympic skier should not have joint custody of her son because he lives on a yacht and has substance abuse problems. Daddy: Bode Miller also has a 4-year-old daughter, Neesyn Darcey, from a previous relationship with Chanel Johnson . Miller has also . filed for joint legal and physical custody as well as child support . payments for a child by another woman - Chanel Johnson.

Whilst the idea of prison is to curtail ones freedom, it seems that tens of inmates in Tennessee are living life to the max, behind bars. Videos and pictures posted to around 100 prisoners personal Facebook pages show the convicts are surrounded by drugs, money and even get to party, despite being in jail. Inmates aren't supposed to have even have internet access, let alone have their own cell phones which are forbidden in prisons. Scroll down for video... This is the life! Inmates in West Tennessee jail post photos of themselves having fun whilst in the slammer . Hoarders: He may be banged up, but that doesn't mean this inmate can't enjoy a snack or two, or three... A district attorney from West Tennessee says a change in the law has to occur to prevent postings like this from happening. Mike Dunavant has one federal prison, three state prisons, and five county jails in his district. He told WAFB that the prisoners are getting around a loophole in the law. For . although it is illegal to bring a cell phone into prison, it is not . illegal to posses one once inside.  He says that law needs to be . changed. 'It's certainly . offensive to victims of crime and to citizens of this state who really . expect inmates will not have access to the Internet, not have the . luxuries of Facebook as we have,' Dunavant said. He believes the prisoners behaviour to be disturbing, offensive and dangerous. One inmate revels in being in the slammed: 'Between me and you, this s*** ain't half bad,' Burning down the house: It seems the prisoners can get away with virtually anything - here they burn a t-shirt in a cell . Contraband: Cellphones are not allowed to be brought into jail, but once they are behind bars it's not illegal to own one . The videos show the prisoners taking . drugs, smoking, hoarding snacks, giving each other tattoos, and in one . photograph, burning clothes inside a cell. On . one video, a convicted murderer, Rivera Peoples, posted pictures and . video, showing off his contraband iPhone he somehow got in prison to . operate his Facebook page. In . another, an inmate asks Peoples how much money has collected while in . prison. Peoples responds, 'I'm a thousand, definitely a thousand.' Other inmates show pictures of large amounts of cash as well. One picture shows an inmate showing off $200 while in prison and another shares the photo on his Facebook wall. Other Facebook videos show inmates watching TV, singing and rapping. A convicted burglar Martez Wright posted videos of his exploits while in jail in Memphis. He . is seen showing off what he claims is marijuana and then shows off . various junk food and snacks he and his fellow inmates have managed to . hoard. Mo money, mo problems: One convict is making a fortune from selling other contraband goods including drugs . No dope: A prisoner shows off his marijuana in a Facebook post from behind bars . 'We're hungry. About to eat a mother f****** feast. We've got scrumptious items we eat on a daily basis,' Wright said. Dunavant proposes stricter security screening for visitors and a cell signal blocking device inside prisons. He hopes to have a proposal in place for law makers to consider when they reconvene in January. 'Anyone . who sees those videos, they're going to be sickened by it. They're . going to be angry,' said Verna Wyatt, executive director of Tennessee . Voices for Victims, an advocacy group for crime victims. The Channel 4 News . team which conducted the original investigation found inmates using . Facebook not only to communicate instantly with family and friends, but . also to talk to inmates in other prisons. The fear is that despite being off the streets, the criminals can still organise drug crimes and violent crimes. Lighting up: A prisoner lights a blunt in the comfort of his cell . On one occasion two inmates at different prisons contact one another by posting their phone numbers on each others wall. Many of the families of the criminals' victims have said they are outraged at the freedom the inmates are experiencing. The . victims' families said when the criminals were sentenced to prison, . they never imagined them posting photos of themselves to Facebook . watching TV or burying themselves in junk food. Plenty of possessions: This inmates cell looks more like the inside of a student's dorm room with books, clothes and food all on display . Living it up: A prisoner shows the marijuana bags he has for sale behind the prison walls . Convicted murderer Brandon White, who killed Ryan Wright, posted pictures of his phone and holding $200 cash. Ryan's mother, Linda Wright told Channel 4: 'That's not punishment. That's not any kind of punishment. It's just like being out on the outside. It's still freedom for them. We can never communicate again. And he [Brandon White] has access to be able to communicate with the outside world.' The Department of Correction says every correctional facility struggles with contraband. Some of the prisoners who have made postings online are now being investigated, especially those who are seen to be flaunting drugs.

They aren't looking for drugs or bombs - they are looking for people who need a buddy, a belly to rub or a paw to shake. 'His job is to be touched,' volunteer Kyra Hubis said about Henry James, her 5-year-old golden retriever that works a few hours a week at the San Jose airport. 'I am just standing there with him. They are talking to him. If I need to answer for him, I do. But I am at the end of his leash, he's not at the end of mine.' Mineta San Jose International Airport is widely credited with introducing the first airport therapy dog in the days after Sept. 11, 2001, when flights were grounded, passengers were stranded and reaching friends and relatives in the East was nearly impossible. Passengers were anxious and afraid.

Enter Orion, owned by a volunter airport chaplain who got permission to bring the dog to work. He made such a difference that San Jose formalized the program and now has nine dogs. Miami International Airport got onboard the program with one and Los Angeles International Airport has 30 and is hoping to expand its program. The dogs are intended to take the stress out of travel — the crowds, long lines and terrorism concerns. You never know why people are flying, said Heidi Huebner, director of volunteers at LAX, which launched Pets Unstressing Passengers (PUPs) in April. Travelers might be in town for a vacation, a funeral, to visit a sick family member or to attend a business meeting. 'You can literally feel the stress levels drop, people start smiling, strangers start talking to each other and everybody walks away feeling really, really good,' Huebner said. Dogs have to be healthy, skilled, stable, well-mannered and able to work on a slack 4-foot leash, said Billie Smith, executive director of Wyoming-based Therapy Dogs, Inc., which certifies the LAX animals. They have to be comfortable with crowds, sounds, smells — and they need to pass through security like all airport workers.

Handlers are taught to watch for people who fear or dislike dogs or those who might have allergies. In most cases, people approach the dogs, identifiable by the vests or bandannas they wear. Los Angeles' dogs, which are featured on trading cards, are as varied as its airport passengers. There's a long-haired Dalmatian, a Lab-pointer mix, a field spaniel, a poodle, three Australian Labradoodles, a Doberman and a 150-pound Irish wolfhound named Finn who has two tricks. 'He looks you in the eye and lays down on the job,' said owner Brian Valente. 'When I'm around Finn, it makes me feel like things are OK. When Finn's around other people, they are OK. It's almost instant, even if just for a moment,' Valente said. Miami's sole dog, Casey, a 4-year-old golden retriever, is a star. She has her own website, fan mail, business cards and a role on 'Airport 24/7: Miami,' a weekly reality show on the Travel Channel. 'Casey is so pure and genuine,' explained Dickie Davis, director of terminal operations and customer service. 'She's not asking for anything or selling anything. She is just a love magnet.' From left: Marwick Kane with Kai, Lou Friedman with Hazel, and Bod Lederfine with Maggie Mae, walk around the Los Angeles International Airport terminal . Los Angeles' dogs, which are featured on trading cards, are as varied as its airport passengers. When Claudia McCaskill's family recently flew home from vacation in Brazil she requested Casey meet the plane to greet her 5-year-old daughter, Carina, who is autistic. She knew Carina would be low on energy and patience and they still had a 2.5-hour drive home to St. Lucie. Casey and handler Liz Miller were there with a gift basket and Carina fell in love with the dog. 'Thank you for visiting us at the airport so I would be happy,' Carina said in a video the family made for Casey. Now Carina wants to go back and see Casey again. 'I can't say how much we appreciate what they did for us. It not only helped our daughter, but us too,' McCaskill said. Despite all the smiles, there are also hard moments. Before departing from San Jose, a soldier kneeled down and told Henry James: 'OK, buddy, you take care of the house while I am gone,' Hubis said. A woman who said her husband of 40 years told her he wanted a divorce that morning wept on Henry's shoulder. 'He just sat there,' Hubis said. 'He knew.

The demands of a crazed gunman who took a five-year-old boy hostage for six days in an Alabama bunker have been heard for the first time, in newly released recordings. In a recording taken from a surveillance tape on the school bus that Jimmy Lee Dykes held up, he can be heard demanding to be given two children. Charles Poland, the driver, bravely refuses to hand over the children, telling Dykes: 'It's my responsibility to keep these kids on the bus,' before he is shot dead. As well as the school bus drama, the recordings, aired exclusively by ABC News on Friday, include conversations between Dykes and FBI agents as he kept five-year-old Ethan Gilman captive, surrounded by weapons and explosives. Days of tense talks between federal authorities and the 65-year-old included Dykes cursing at negotiators and ranting that his stand with his five-year-old hostage, who has autism, would cause 'chaos' in society and lead to riots, the recordings reveal. 'People are going be standing up to this [expletive] dictatorial, incompetent, self-righteous, bunch of sorry bastards in government,' Dykes said. Members of an FBI hostage rescue team stormed Dykes's underground bunker near Midland City in February, killing him before he harmed Ethan or detonated an improvised explosive that authorities said was in the 6ft by 8ft shelter. In interviews with ABC, FBI agents said they raided the bunker after it became apparent that Dykes was handling weapons and an improvised explosive device more often than he had been at the beginning of the standoff. Dykes apparently planned to have the child detonate the bomb if he was killed, FBI Special Agent Steve Richardson said. 'Jim Dykes relayed to the negotiators, ""If anything happens to me, I have told Ethan to pull the trigger"",' Mr Richardson said. 'That meant he had told Ethan to detonate the IED, the second IED that was inside the bunker.' Saved: Ethan Gilman smiles and plays after being rescued from Dykes' underground bunker . Bravery: Charles Poland, who was shot dead by Dykes, was hailed as a hero for trying to protect the children . Dykes snatched Ethan off a school bus driven by Mr Poland, 66, in January, dragging the child into the bunker after shooting Mr Poland five times in front of the scared children. The audio recording, taken from a bus surveillance tape, indicated that after Dykes boarded the bus he immediately demanded children. 'I need two boys 6 to 8 years old,' Dykes, who was armed with a handgun, is heard saying angrily in the recording. 'Six to 8 years old. I mean it. Right now! Right now!' Mr Poland bravely refused, saying: 'I can't do it. Sorry, you're going to have to shoot me.' 'How about I shoot a kid then,' Dykes replied. Moments after Dykes boarded the bus 15-year-old Tre' Watts called 911, telling the woman who answered there was a man on their bus. 'He's got a gun,' Tre' can be heard saying. 'And he keeps asking for kids.' The dispatcher asks: 'He's aiming the gun at the bus driver?' Muffled gun shots and the sound of screaming can then be heard as the dispatcher asks: 'Oh my gosh, what's going on?' 'He just shot Mr. Poland,' Tre' tells her. 'I think Mr. Poland is dead.' The 66-year-old driver had been shot five times. He was hailed as a hero for protecting more than two dozen children on the bus. Hideout: Dykes kept Ethan in an underground bunker and spoke to FBI agents through a pipe . After he shot Mr Poland, Dykes grabbed Ethan and headed to the bunker he had constructed. Once there, he used a phone and a pipe to communicate with authorities. The recordings show he was disdainful of government and taunted negotiators with obscenities. Agent Richardson said the FBI was not optimistic about the situation, fearing for Ethan's life. 'We thought Ethan was going to die,' he told ABC News. 'Our negotiators, our behavioral science folks, behavioral analysis folks told us the best you can hope for is a murder-suicide.' Authorities previously said Dykes wanted to make a public statement about his complaints against the government, but never revealed specific topics. The recording indicated he believed he could spark anarchy. 'You know goddamn well what I'd say when I go public,' Dykes said. 'It's going to create chaos. It's going to create riots. ... People are going be standing up to this [expletive] dictatorial, incompetent, self-righteous, bunch of sorry bastards in government.' Rescue mission: FBI agents stormed the bunker, killing Dykes and saving Ethan six days after the kidnap . FBI behavioral scientist Molly Amman, who helped with the hostage situation, said: 'I was immediately concerned. [Dykes] was angry but intelligent and controlled.' She added: 'Charles Poland was a friend of his. Maybe his only friend. He very coldly made a promise ... to Mr. Poland: ""You will do this or I will kill you"". And he killed him.' Neighbors had said Dykes was known as 'Mean Man' because of his anti-government rants, and for carrying a rifle and a shovel. His motive is still unclear, although Dykes was due in court the day after the school bus confrontation on a charge of firing a weapon at neighbors. Agent Sean Van Slyke told ABC News that in a final twist to the hostage situation, Dykes had planned 'to have a female reporter down there with him, and that she would hold his hand while, in fact, he got his final message out to the world and then committed suicide in her presence'. Fortunately, agents, most of whom have children of their own, were able to storm the bunker, killing Dykes and rescuing Ethan who suffered no physical injury during his time in captivity.","Audio records hero bus driver Charles Poland refusing to hand over child .

"By . Paul Scott . PUBLISHED: . 20:02 EST, 31 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:04 EST, 1 June 2013 . Split: Paul Hollywood confirmed he has split from wife Alexandra. The couple have an 11-year-old son . By rights, this should be a time of celebration for Paul Hollywood. After all, it is not every week your new TV show airs on one of America’s biggest networks. And the Wirral-born celebrity baker has long harboured hopes of carving out the U.S. fame to match his showbiz surname. Yet, instead of toasting his success, Hollywood cut a tortured figure this week as he sat slumped behind the wheel of his flashy Aston Martin sports car in a Kent village, his head in his hands. As he arrived back at his 13th-century marital home for ‘crisis’ talks with his estranged wife Alexandra, he bore the haunted look of someone who has come, belatedly, to the realisation he faces losing everything he’s strived for. Gone is the carefree demeanour he displayed when appearing alongside Marcela Valladolid, the beautiful chef he is said to have become close to on the U.S. version of The Great British Bake Off, which debuted on U.S. TV on Wednesday night. The show’s producers had been doing much to trumpet the pair’s supposed on-screen sexual chemistry, with promos showing the doll-like Miss Valladolid, 34, licking her lips and gazing at her British co-star, 47. Yet reviews of the first episode have criticised the pair for lacking any spark. This must be mildly cheering for Alexandra, 49, the mother of Hollywood’s son Josh, 11, whom the chef walked out on last month amid rumours about his friendship with American-born Marcela. Alexandra has taken off her wedding ring and is said to be demanding a divorce from Hollywood, who has moved into a flat close to the home they shared in Wingham, Kent. Which might explain why Hollywood looks so worried. He has good reason to be concerned. Despite the belated public backing of his BBC bosses this week, his long-term future on The Great British Bake Off remains in jeopardy following a backlash from his once-smitten female fans. At the same time, he may face being financially crippled if his wife follows through with her threat of ending the marriage. For Hollywood’s part, sources on his BBC2 show say he is desperate for a reconciliation with his wife — and has turned to co-star Mary Berry for help winning her back. New clues suggest the pair’s marriage was stable until recently. A month before the split, the bread-maker turned showbiz personality set up a new business to funnel his growing television and media earnings. Rumours: Paul is apparently dating his The American Baking Competition co-host Marcela Valladolid . Leading ladies: Paul Hollywood has become a household name presenting with chef Mary Berry (right). He recently filmed the US version of the show with Marcels Valladolid (left) Significantly, he appointed Alexandra to the role of company secretary when launching PJH Media Limited on March 7 this year. According to records at Companies House, the husband and wife are the only shareholders in the firm, which has its registered office in a terrace of commercial properties in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. Alexandra was already the secretary of his only other business, Paul Hollywood Limited, which was first registered as a company in July 2004. And business is booming. As well as his six-figure BBC salary and a similar fee for the U.S. counterpart, his bestselling book Paul Hollywood’s Bread, released in March to coincide with a spin-off TV series, has pushed the baker’s earnings close to  £1.5million in the past year. Accountants say that, even after a divorce, Alexandra would be under no obligation to resign her position, which, importantly, gives her a half share in the new company’s profits. The fact Hollywood appointed her to the role so recently signposts how quickly the relationship broke down. The new firm was set up just a week before Hollywood flew off to Georgia in the U.S. to film for two months with former pastry chef Miss Valladolid, a divorced mother-of-one. By the time he returned, his marriage was over. Now Alexandra is said to be talking to lawyers, which could include walking away with her share of the couple’s assets, which include their £800,000, grade I-listed home. Certainly, no one can deny that blonde Alexandra, whom Hollywood met when he was working as a baker at a hotel in Cyprus in the Nineties, has been there alongside him every step of the way as he rose to fame. She helped him set up his successful bread-making business, based in Aylesham, Kent, which supplies Harrods and Waitrose. Beloved: The BBC2 programme has cultivated a wholesome, traditional image that appeals to millions of viewers . Firm friends: Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood have been good friends since they met eight years ago . He then landed his role in The Great British Bake Off, alongside judge Mary Berry, in 2010. And it is to 78-year-old Mrs Berry he has turned, in the hope of salvaging his marriage — and reputation. Friends say he is hoping Mary, with whom he started filming the fourth series of the British show in Somerset this month, will act as a go-between in his bid to win Alexandra back. And Mary, who regularly puts up her co-judge at the Buckinghamshire home she shares with her husband of 47 years, Paul Hunnings, is believed to be keen to help, offering to telephone Alexandra to push Hollywood’s case. The two couples, who have known each other since Berry and Hollywood appeared on a satellite food channel in 2005, have been regular dinner companions and Alexandra describes Mary as ‘wonderful’ But Mrs Hollywood will have been unimpressed when the grand dame of baking defended Hollywood to friends last week, saying: ‘You can’t blame him, things happen and boys will be boys.’ What is undeniable is that Hollywood’s problems might all be solved if his wife were to take him back. Hollywood, who revels in the soubriquet ‘the George Clooney of baking’, has been stung by the backlash from one-time devotees on Twitter and other social media. The BBC reacted to claims members of the production team want him dropped from the series for damaging its ‘wholesome’ image by announcing his job was safe . Mary has hinted she would quit if he got the chop. But sources at the Corporation say it would have been nigh on impossible to replace him for the current series because filming had started when news of his marriage split and alleged affair broke earlier this month. And executives who have been in touch with Bake Off’s executive producer Richard McKerrow have refused to give private assurances to Hollywood he will still have a job once this series has aired this summer. Only recently, the chef, who worked as head baker at The Dorchester Hotel in London, had been talking about his hopes he would still be making the show in 15 years’ time. Traditional: Mary Berry, 78 was expected to disapprove of Hollywood's antics, but she is said to be supporting him in this difficult time . He is said by friends to refer to his role as judge and its lucrative spin-offs as the ‘family silver’. With Miss Valladolid on the other side of the Atlantic, clearly Hollywood’s thoughts have turned back to the devoted Alexandra, who until recently had talked lovingly on Twitter of cooking him his favourite steak flambé with prunes, cream and Stilton. So far, she is said to have rebuffed his attempts at a reconciliation. I am told she took soundings from her closest girlfriends at a spa day to celebrate her birthday earlier this month. Some friends are adamant she should refuse to take him back. Meanwhile, members of the crew on the set of the U.S. version told the Mail how Miss Valladolid and Hollywood retired to a shared trailer between takes. While the show’s host Jeff Foxworthy had his motor home close to the set, theirs was, say production staff, partitioned into ‘his and hers’ quarters. Hollywood and Miss Valladolid also stayed at the same Marriott hotel while on location. It is clear they got on like a house on fire judging by the photos of them posing together they posted on Twitter and her description of him as a ‘handsome devil’. However, Miss Valladolid has made it plain she has no intention of coming to Britain and has set her sights on becoming the most famous female chef in the U.S. According to sources, she would also not want to take her nine-year-son Fausto out of the school he attends near her home San Diego, California. She is divorced from the boy’s father, after whom he is named, Mexican politician Fausto Gallardo. Last year, the couple had a brief reconciliation, during which she described her ex as her ‘Latin-loving-rodeo-riding-sexy-as-hell-husband’ However, she and Gallardo split again before she met Hollywood. Miss Valladolid, who trained as a chef in LA and Paris, started her own catering company in Tijuana, Mexico, and later created a brand of tequila. Meanwhile, former colleagues in Cyprus are raising knowing eyebrows at talk of Hollywood’s travails. By all accounts, he was known for having an ‘eye for the ladies’ during his time working at the five-star Anassa and Annabelle hotels on the island. At the time, rumours flew around the expat community that he was being followed around by two besotted local girls even after meeting Kent-born Alexandra, who was working there as a scuba diving instructor. One British chef, who was a guest at the couple’s wedding on Cyprus in 1998, said: ‘Paul was focused on his work. 'He was a brilliant baker. He helped open three hotels and worked incredibly hard. I never once saw him on the beach. It’s hard on your social life, but Paul was always popular.’ Judging by his effect on Miss Valladolid, not much has changed. The question is whether Hollywood can work his charms on his devastated wife — and rescue his shaky career.","Celebrity baker has split from wife Alexandra of 15 years .

"By . Anthony Bond . PUBLISHED: . 02:54 EST, 1 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:00 EST, 1 June 2013 . A father and son who ran a haulage business for 99p stores have been found guilty of the manslaughter of one of their drivers who fell asleep at the wheel. Adrian John McMurray, 54, and Adrian Paul McMurray, 36, were convicted of the killing of Stephen Kenyon, from Milton Keynes. Father-of-four Mr Kenyon was crushed to death when his 39 tonne Renault lorry crashed into a line of stationary traffic on the southbound carriageway of the M1. Convicted: Adrian John McMurray, 54, right,and Adrian Paul McMurray, 36, left, were convicted of the killing of Stephen Kenyon . The jury at St Albans Crown Court was told the death was 'an accident waiting to happen' as the the Mr Kenyon had been working for more than 19 hours and had been driving for over 13 of them. Road haulage legislation states that truckers can only drive large commercial lorries for a maximum of 10 hours in a 24 hour period, and then only two days a week. For the rest of the week, the maximum time they can spend behind the wheel of a lorry is nine hours. Tachographs are fitted to every large vehicle to record a driver's activities, but in 35-year-old Mr Kenyon's case two tachograph charts were being used. This practice was 'tolerated if not encouraged' by the McMurrays, who ran AJ Haulage, based in Daventry, Northants, the jury was told. Although cabs can be fitted with two tachographs, if there is a relief driver on board, the prosecution said Mr Kenyon was using them both when he died and was driving longer hours that legally permitted so he could increase his earnings. At the time he had debts of around £10,000. Friends and family noticed how tired he was and how he would often fall asleep in a chair. Tragic: Stephen Kenyon, pictured, was crushed to death when his 39 tonne Renault lorry crashed into a line of stationary traffic on southbound carriageway of the M1 . Adrian John McMurray, of Daventry, and Adrian Paul McMurray, from Northampton, pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and failing to discharge an employer's duty. After 16 hours and 52 minutes the jury unanimously convicted the father of both charges. They found the son guilty of manslaughter by a majority of 10 to 2 and unanimously on the second charge. It followed the accident on Friday . February 12 2010 between junction 10, the Luton Airport exit and . junction 9, the exit for Redbourn and Dunstable. Prosecutor Charles Miskin QC told the jury of seven men and five women the case was one of: 'gross negligence and manslaughter.' At the time of the fatal crash, the firm worked solely for the shop chain 99p Stores, delivering goods to branches up and down the country and collecting waste material such as cardboard packaging and bringing it back to the retail chain's central depot in Daventry. In the five years to February 2010 AJ Haulage, which had its yard at the depot, had rapidly grown from having two drivers to a fleet of 25 lorries and 40 trailers. But the jury was told that the firm's administration had not kept pace and rarely were there sufficient drivers to do all that was required. 'Drivers were frequently asked to do deliveries that would take them over permitted hours. Tired drivers pose a risk to themselves and others.This is a case about a man who lost his life because the rules were broken,' said Mr Miskin. He said the father and son showed a 'flagrant disregard for the law' in the pursuit of profit. Mr Misken went on: 'His death was the utterly foreseeable consequence of the way the defendants conducted their business. It was an accident waiting to happen. 'Their negligence had exposed him (Mr Kenyon) to the risk of death and that failure had been so reprehensible that it amounted to gross negligence.' He said the defendants had failed to carry out any kind of 'risk assessment.' Moments before the crash a couple travelling south noticed Mr Kenyon's lorry drifting form the slow lane towards the middle lane two or three times. 'He was exhausted and had fallen asleep,' said the prosecutor. As they went past the lorry, Mr Kenyon who had left Daventry, and was on his way to Essex with a delivery, could be seen rubbing his eyes. Ahead traffic was slowing because of congestion and a lorry in front of Mr Kenyon's vehicle had come to a halt at the rear of a line of stationary traffic. The jury heard despite braking hard at the last moment, Mr Kenyon crashed into the back of the lorry in front. His cab was crushed and he received serious head and chest injuries. He was pronounced dead at the scene at 2.26am that morning. The tachographs showed he had been at work since 5am the previous morning. He had been on duty for 19 hours and 15 minutes, and had been driving for 13 hours and 8 minutes, covering 592 miles. The court was told the father and son were not monitoring the tachograph charts of their drivers as they should have been. They should also have retained the drivers' charts for a year. Mr Misken said they were required to employ a 'qualified transport manager' which was never done and claims that the head office for AJ Haulage was in Northern Ireland were false. Records were not kept to show when vehicles had been maintained. Mr Miskin added: 'They failed to take steps to reduce the risk to drivers and to the public. They repeatedly exposed him to risk of death by asking him to work longer hours than he should have. This was a wilful disregard of the tachograph law. 'The breaches amount to criminal offences and they put profit before safety. It was an accident waiting to happen in the context of a business where every corner was cut.' Not just the drivers but the public had been put at risk. Giving evidence McMurray senior told the jury he thought the Renault lorry was in the yard and was not being driven by Mr Keynon, who had worked for him since late 2009, when it crashed. He said that he and all the other drivers were paid in cash and were left to sort out their own tax and National Insurance. There were no difficulties with his work, but on January 27 2010, a lorry he was driving was written off after it jack-knifed on road works on the motorway. 'Someone stopped in front of him. He was coming to the end of the road works and someone nipped in in front of him,' he said. Asked if he took any action against Mr Kenyon, he replied: 'No, accidents happen,' he replied.He said he had not been responsible for the drivers' running list on the day of the accident and the days before. He said he saw Mr Kenyon at 9pm that night in the lorry in the yard. He said he knew Mr Kenyon sometimes slept in the cab. He was asleep when he got a phone call from his ex-wife in Northern Ireland, who had been contacted by the police to say that Mr McMurray himself had been killed in a road accident. 'I said ""It's not me"".' Officers then contacted him and told him there had been an accident on the motorway. He said when the police told him the lorry involved he said: 'That can't be right. I thought the vehicle was in the yard.' Asked how he felt when he heard of the news of Mr Kenyon's death he said: 'You didn't want to see anyone die. I was very much upset.' His son did not give evidence. Reporting of the case which finished earlier this month was subject to a contempt of court order because the father and son faced trial for cheating the Inland Revenue and VAT. But they changed their pleas yesterday. Adrian John McMurray and co-defendant Heather Parkinson, 69, of Parkhill, Dromore, County Down pleaded guilty to cheating the Inland Revenue of £311,976 between 6 April 2005 and 3 September 2009 and evading £424,248 VAT between 1 February 2005 and 31 July 2009. Adrian John McMurray and Adrian Paul McMurry admitted cheating the PAYE and National Insurance system of £896,050 between 6 April 2005 and 5 April 2010. Heather Parkinson admitted cheating the public revenue and National Insurace of £15,081.76p. Judge Andrew Bright QC adjourned sentence for reports to be prepared on the defendants. All three defendants are due to be sentenced on 28 June. They were all released on bail.","Stephen Kenyon crushed to death when his lorry crashed on M1 .

Hundreds of Buddhist men on motorcycles waved iron rods and bamboo poles in a northeastern town in Burma today, the latest incident to spill over from simmering religious tensions in the country. The intimidating display in Lashio came a day after a mosque and a Muslim orphanage were torched after reports that a Muslim man set fire to a Buddhist woman. Residents said a cinema was burned as the mob sped around the town as part of a new wave of violence targeting the religious minority. Scroll down for video . Motorcade: Hundreds of Buddhists on motorcycles armed with sticks patrol in the streets of in Lashio, Burma . The men became angry after rumors spread that a Muslim man had set fire to a Buddhist woman . Many Buddhists and Muslims stayed locked inside their homes and shops were shuttered after Tuesday's violence in the town, near the border with China. It is the latest region to fall prey to the country's spreading sectarian violence between Buddhists and Muslims. The fresh wave of chaos will reinforce doubts that President Thein Sein's government can or will act to contain the violence and crack down on racial and religious intolerance. Wednesday morning was quiet, but by afternoon several hundred young men, screaming and waving sticks, roamed the downtown area on motorcycles near the city hall. A Buddhist monk was seen seated on the back of one of the motorcycles, waving a stick. Unrest: Burma has been reeling from a series of flare-ups over simmering tensions between Buddhists and Muslims . On another street, the crowd threw rocks at buildings. Many people were too afraid to step outside. Smoke could be seen over at least one area of town, and local politician Sai Myint Maung said a cinema had been burned and that there were rumors that more troublemakers were gathered on the outskirts of the town. 'The situation has changed 180 degrees. It was quiet the whole day and all of a sudden there is a fire and the situation has changed,' he said. A 48-year-old man accused of setting . fire to a 24-year-old Buddhist woman was arrested, state television . reported. It said the man, identified as an Indian Muslim, threw gasoline on the woman. The man was charged with causing . grievous injuries and arson, as well as drug possession due to . stimulants found in his pocket, the TV report said. The woman was being treated for burns to her chest, back and hands. The report did not mention whether . any members of Tuesday night's Buddhist mob were arrested, an omission . likely to fuel more questions over whether minority Muslims can find justice in overwhelmingly Buddhist Burma. Arson: People watch a burning mosque in Lashio. There were no reported fatalities after the rioting . An officer from the No. 1 Lashio police station said police had been dispatched by truck to try to quell the new violence. The officer, who did not want to be identified, said at least four people were hurt. 'My family is staying inside. We are afraid of being attacked,' said one Muslim resident, Ko Maung Gyi, who spoke to the Associated Press by telephone earlier from inside his locked home in Lashio's main Muslim neighborhood. 'I never expected that such racial violence would erupt in Lashio,' he said. 'Our small town is multiethnic and we have lived in peace for a long time.' There were no reported fatalities after Tuesday night's violence in the remote mountain town. Order was initially restored after authorities banned gatherings of more than five people. A dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed and many shops and streets were empty, Sai Myint Maung said. The government has appealed for calm. 'Damaging religious buildings and creating religious riots is inappropriate for the democratic society we are trying to create,' presidential spokesman Ye Htut said on his Facebook page. People celebrate around the burning mosque. An Islamic school and orphanage were also torched . The message noted that 'two religious buildings and some shops' in Lashio were burned, without specifying whether they were Muslim or Buddhist. 'Any criminal act will be dealt with according to the law,' Ye Htut added. Minority Muslims have been the main victims of the deadly violence, but so far there have been no criminal trials against members of the country's Buddhist majority. After the alleged fire attack, an irate crowd of more than 100 people, including Buddhist monks, gathered outside a police station demanding that the alleged attacker be handed over, state TV reported. The mob also set fire to a Muslim school and orphanage that was so badly damaged only two walls remained, said Min Thein, a resident contacted by telephone. Police and other witnesses confirmed the school burning. The Burmese government has appealed for claim in the aftermath of the violence . Burma's sectarian violence first flared in western Rakhine state last year, when hundreds of people died in clashes between Buddhists and Muslims that drove about 140,000 others, mostly Muslims, from their homes. The clashes seemed confined to that region, but in late March, similar Buddhist-led violence swept the town of Meikthila in central Burma, killing at least 43 people. Earlier this month, a court sentenced seven Muslims from Meikthila to prison terms for their role in the violence. Muslims account for about four per cent of Burma's roughly 60 million people. Anti-Muslim sentiment is closely tied to nationalism and the dominant Buddhist religion, so leaders have been reluctant to speak up for the unpopular minority. Thein Sein's administration, which came to power in 2011 after half a century of military rule, has been heavily criticised for not doing enough to protect Muslims. He vowed last week during a trip to the U.S. that all perpetrators of the sectarian violence would be brought to justice.","The men patrolled a border town armed with sticks and rocks .

A man who developed anorexia and shrank to just 4st 5lbs has told how dying for 20 minutes helped shock him into recovery. Matthew Booth, 20, began starving himself when he was 14-years-old. At his worst, he stopped eating and drinking completely and at 18 was rushed to hospital, where his heart stopped and doctors battled for 20 minutes to bring him back to life. Matthew Booth, 20, developed anorexia as a teenager (left, in 2011), but was shocked into recovery after 'dying' for 20  minutes due to heart failure when his weight dropped to 4st 5lb . Incredibly, he has now made a full recovery and is hoping to become a personal trainer. The student, from Bury, Manchester, said his problems began when he was relentlessly beaten by a gang of school bullies every day for over a year because he was 'different'. He was so desperate to stop the beatings that he started compulsively exercising and lifting weights to bulk up, throwing his lunch away in an attempt to change his appearance and 'fit in' at school. But eventually, unable to stop the bullies, he dropped out of school. He said: 'I thought I was picked on for the way I looked so I wanted to change that. I had long hair, was into heavy metal music and a drummer in the school band so I wasn't in with the popular kids. 'I started lifting weights to try and get bigger to defend myself against the bullies, but I also began skipping meals, thinking this would help me bulk up. 'But the weight started falling off me, and it felt good to have something in my life I could actually control. Fed up of with the abuse I dropped out of school.' Matthew with his mother Brenda, 61, in The Priory Hospital Adult Eating Disorder clinic in Cheadle in April 2011, after 'dying' two months earlier. At his lowest, he skipped breakfast and lunch and exercised for up to eight hours a day . Alone at home, while his mother Brenda, 61, worked full time as a civil servant, Matthew skipped breakfast and lunch, exercising up to eight hours a day. Eventually, after he'd stopped eating altogether and had shrunk to 7st, his worried mother Brenda took her son to the doctor. He was diagnosed with anorexia and hospitalised two months later weighing just 5st 8lbs. Matthew said: 'By the time I was admitted I couldn't walk and had to be taken in in a wheelchair. 'I refused to eat at first, but after a year of intensive therapy at three different eating disorder clinics, I really missed home and started to eat. 'My weight increased to 9st 4lbs and the doctors allowed me to go home. 'But as soon as I got home I went back to my old eating habits and excessive exercise. 'I was desperate to lose the weight again. I knew the only way I would be able to stay home was to trick people into thinking I was better. A normal childhood: Matthew's problems began at school, when he was relentlessly beaten by a gang of school bullies every day for over a year because he was 'different' 'I had to attend weigh-ins every two weeks to monitor my recovery, but I would drink two litres of water just before my appointment so I appeared to have gained. The doctors couldn't tell what I was doing. 'Whenever I saw my mum in the evenings I would tell her what I'd eaten for breakfast and lunch. She worked full time, so it was easy to lie to her. 'I didn't even feel bad, I wasn't thinking straight. It was like someone else was living in my head.' Despite the pain, the unrelenting cold and the constant feeling of exhaustion, Matthew could not break free from his obsession and he continued to restrict his body of food. At this time Matthew had also began purging his food and abusing laxatives, taking up to 40 a day.He spent the whole of Christmas day 2010 on his exercise bike, unable to relax at the thought of gaining just one pound. At his thinnest, Matthew weighed just 5st 8lbs. He had stopped eating and drinking completely and became delusional, refusing to go into the kitchen for fear that food or drink would somehow enter his body . His body was shutting down and his mind . had reached extreme levels of obsession. His anorexia sparked an . all-consuming OCD, leading him to spend up to 16-hours a day walking in . circles around his living room, unable to sit down. At his worst, Matthew stopped drinking for three weeks, refusing to brush his teeth or even wash his face in fear that just a drop of water would see him gain weight. His lips were constantly bleeding from the dehydration. Matthew said: 'By January 2011 nothing was allowed to pass through my mouth. I would wake up at 4am every morning and pace my bedroom in a zombie state until 10 o'clock at night. 'It was like I was on autopilot and unable to stop. I was struggling to stand but determined to exercise no matter how much pain my body was in. 'I was dreaming about food, it was clear my body was calling out for me to eat and drink, but I denied it.It was so bad that I became delusional, my mind was telling me I had drank some water when I hadn't and I was going mad with paranoia. Full recovery: Matthew Booth, 20, with girlfriend Tammy, 18, in 2012. He now has ambitions to become a personal trainer one day . 'I would shout at my mum to tell me if I had eaten a slice of toast on her plate. I was convinced I had. 'By the end I couldn't swallow, my lips were cracked and were constantly bleeding. My face was practically rotting.' At this point Matthew wouldn't even go into the kitchen out of fear that food or drink would somehow enter his body. In February 2011, when he was 18, Matthew was sectioned by his doctor and rushed to Fairfield Hospital in Bury. Two days later he suffered heart failure and died for 20 minutes. Doctors were able to revive him, but told him he would die again if he didn't start eating. Matthew said: 'I remember waking up and the doctor looking at me saying 'you just died,' I couldn't believe it. I burst into tears.They said if they hadn't had taken me in when they did I'd be dead. It was the wake up call I needed to start recovering. 'When my mum turned up and told me they had rang her after 10 minutes of trying to revive me telling her I might not live, I felt so guilty for putting her through it all. Support: Matthew says his girlfriend Tammy reassures him about his body and makes him feel confident about the way he looks. He believes that his near death experience changed his outlook on life forever . 'I asked her to pass me a mirror so I . could look at my face. When I saw my reflection I didn't recognise the . person staring back at me. 'I . looked like an 80-year-old man, not an 18-year-old boy. I was being . tube fed and had to go to the toilet through a tube. It was . humiliating.' Matthew's body was so damaged that doctors had to check his blood every two hours to monitor his glucose levels. The starvation had caused liver, kidney and heart failure. Matthew says his near death experience made him realise how much he really wanted to live . Matthew fell unconscious two days later after suffering from re-feeding syndrome. He spent four weeks in hospital being fed through tubes and was later referred to Cheadle Adult Eating Disorder clinic for further treatment and physiotherapy to help him walk again. Matthew, who now lives in Lowestoft, Suffolk with girlfriend, Tammy Earrye, 18 said: 'Gradually my body started to recover and I was determined never to go back to hospital again. 'I became more positive and began to eat, increasing my calorie intake every day. 'A year after I was discharged I met Tammy online. At first I was scared to tell her what had happened to me, but once I opened up to her she was so understanding and caring. I could tell her anything. 'She was my first girlfriend and she made me feel like I wasn't a freak and that she liked me for who I was. 'Whenever I feel insecure about my body she tells me she loves me the way I am and that I should be confident about the way I look. I still get horrible thoughts, but she's there to support me on my down days.' Matthew is now training to become a fitness trainer. He added: 'My near death experience made me realise how much I really wanted to live. It changed my outlook on life and I was determined to recover. 'Knowing I might not have lived still upsets me today. I feel guilty for putting my mum through the worry of losing a child. 'Coming back from the dead made me want to live. I was given a second chance at life and wasn't going to waste it.'","Matthew Booth, from Bury, Manchester, began starving himself and excessively lifting weights aged 14 after being bullied for being 'different'

Support: Sir Ben Kingsley is behind London's theatreland on its stance over keeping its traditional lights . Actor Sir Ben Kingsley is backing a campaign to stop Brussels pulling the plug on Britain’s theatre lights. The star of Gandhi, Iron Man and Schindler’s List has joined the fight to save playhouses from tough new EU measures requiring them to do away with old-style lighting and install ‘eco-friendly’ systems instead. Sir Ben urged Brussels to rethink the crackdown amid fears it will ‘ruin’ the look of hit London shows such as Les Misérables and War Horse. Critics also say the move will threaten the survival of struggling amateur theatre companies which would not be able to afford new lights. The ‘Theatreland v Brussels’ row centres on the EU decision to phase out traditional tungsten incandescent light bulbs in favour of ‘greener’ LED units. It is already illegal to import or manufacture the old-style bulbs, although people can use them while stocks last. But campaigners say the new LED (light emitting diode) units are unsuitable for the stage. Michael Hulls, a lighting designer and co-ordinator of the campaign, said: ‘Of course, we all agree with moves to save the environment. 'But telling people to use LED units to light theatre productions is like telling Leonardo da Vinci to swap his oil paints for felt-tip pens. In jeopardy: Plays such as War Horse at National Theatre would have their appearance ruined by the new lights . 'LED lighting cannot yet replicate tungsten. 'You couldn’t have an LED bulb in a . bedside lamp in a period production or in a chandelier in a 19th Century . play – it would just look totally wrong.’ Mr Hulls fears many amateur theatre companies could go to the wall. He said: ‘They can’t afford these changes. Replacing an existing fitting may cost you £20 compared to £2,000 for an LED.’ Former Tory Minister Peter Luff said: ‘A big mistake has been made that could have serious consequences for theatres.’ A spokesman for Sir Ben said yesterday he was ‘very happy’ to lend his backing to the campaigners, who include lighting directors behind box-office successes such as The Audience, starring Helen Mirren, Les Misérables and War Horse. Hit show: The lighting director behind The Audience is campaigning against the new rules . Last night, the European Commission insisted that theatres were free to continue to use tungsten lighting. A spokesman said: ‘The regulation has specific provisions exempting the production and use of special lighting such as that used in theatres.’ However, campaigners say the exemption does not cover many of the lights needed for theatre productions.",EU measures require theatres to install ‘eco-friendly’ lighting systems .

Like others in his graduating class, Lhagyari Trichen Namgyal Wangchuk is excited to leave St. Andrew's School this week and begin the four-year American institution of college - a rite of passage in the U.S. But unlike many of his classmates, Trichen, as he's known, doesn't take this privilege lightly. As the last remaining descendant of Tibetan kings, who was mentored from an early age by the Dalai Lama, the 20-year-old knows all too well that millions of people suffering in his homeland don't enjoy the same freedoms. Last King: Lhagyari Trichen Namgyal Wangchuk, the King of Tibet, pictured, is studying in America . Trichen grew up with his mother and . three older sisters in exile in northern India, where he attended a . Tibetan Children's Village boarding school in Dharamasala. His childhood was by no means privileged but his family got by renting space to shop owners. His . father, Lhagyari Trichen Namgyal Gyatso, a former Tibetan king who was . thrown in prison for more than two decades, passed away when Trichen was . just 11 years old, leaving him as the only recognized descendant of the . first Dharma King of Tibet, King Songstem Gamp, who introduced Buddhism . in the seventh century. A year later, aged 12, Trichen was coronated by the Dalai Lama, one of whose speeches his father was meditating to when he died. 'When I first met him officially, I almost forgot my name,' Trichen told Delaware Online in an extensive interview this week. He . said at first he struggled with the marathon prayer sessions, knowing . his friends were mucking around, carefree, in the streets. Boarding school: Trichen has attended St. Andrews School, pictured, in Delaware since 2010. The school is featured in the 1989 film 'Dead poets Society' America: Trichen, pictured, has made close friends at school, where he learned Chinese - his fourth language . Invisible king: Trichen, pictured top row at right, has immersed himself in American culture during his time here . But, as he grew older, he became grateful for the opportunity to be a 'voice for the voiceless' and call, if not for independence from China then at least human rights for the Tibetan people. It was during one of these sessions when the Dalai Lama suggested Trichen pursue a 'modern education' in America. And in 2010 he enrolled at St. Andrew's, the prestigious school portrayed in the film 'Dead Poets Society,' with the help of New York-based filmmaker Holly Carter. Earlier that year, Carter made a documentary about Trichen and his county, which he narrated in English. The school, featured in the 1989 film, gave Trichen a full scholarship and other wealthy benefactors funded the living expenses of its first-ever Tibetan student. 'In my old school, we would listen and memorize,' Trichen told Delaware Online. 'Here, I think. Here, I talk.' He studied Mandarin at the school - his fourth language - to deepen his connection with his late father, he told the website. Kings: Trichen's dad, pictured right with him as a child, died when he was 11 and he was coronated a year later . Documentary: Trichen, right, starred in a 2012 film called My Country Is Tibet, about him and his country . Help: The filmmaker, Holly Carter, helped Trichen, pictured, get into St. Andrew's and find donors to supplement his living expenses . 'It's really hard to let him go,' ChiaChyi Chiu, Trichen's academic adviser and Chinese language instructor told Delaware Online. 'He has a very humble heart,' Chiu said. 'He is willing to learn from everybody.' On holidays, Trichen stayed with Carter, other 'second mothers' and some St. Andrew's faculty, who introduced him to Americanisms including Starbucks and the Philadelphia cheesesteak. He also spent summers babysitting for friends of these families in the Hamptons. This year, he bunked with another student in Greenwich, Connecticut, and passed the time slamming tennis balls against the wall and singing along to Jack Johnson. 'They don't care about my title,' he said. 'They like me as a person. In my hometown, we are friends, but they know who I am.' But while he's tried hard to fit in as an American, his homeland is always close to his heart. Dharamasala: Trichen grew up with his mother and three older sisters in exile in Northern India, where he went to the local school, pictured . Old school: St. Andrew's was a big change from the Tibetan Children's Village boarding school in Dharamasala, India, pictured . Over the past three years, he has visited dozens of schools across the U.S. to spread the word about the plight of his people. He said he usually starts the speeches by sharing his affection for the Chinese people - and his love of Chinese food. But he also wants to explain the injustices Tibetans have been dealt for more than 60 years - since the Chinese invaded Tibet, exiled the Dalai Lama and threw his father in prison where he was shocked with electric prods and forced to wear heavy chains, he said. He informs the audiences that his people's cultural identity is becoming diluted because they are not permitted to study in the languages of their ancestors. In the fall, Trichen will attend Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania, where he plans to major in political science. But he dreams of going to the land of those ancestors, and the home of the most spectacular mountains in the world, to serve some six million Tibetans in a democracy, which he deems 'the best policy of the 21st century.' 'I would have to be elected,' he said. 'I don't want to be the chosen one.'

Unwanted exposure: Cressida Bonas in the Beautiful Bottoms flyer, which was shot three years ago but has resurfaced . A lingerie company called Beautiful Bottoms is circulating an early modelling picture of Prince Harry’s girlfriend Cressida Bonas, taken three years ago. The Mail on Sunday can exclusively reveal the photograph of the Prince’s 24-year-old girlfriend  modelling a green and white floral bikini for the upmarket company owned by three of her friends – Poppy Sexton-Wainwright, Isabel Bradshaw and Lauren Skerritt. Cressida flirted with the idea of becoming a model and it is understood she offered to help her friends by posing for this photo in 2010, long before she entered into a romance with Prince Harry. Friends of Cressida, now an aspiring . dancer studying at Trinity Laban Conservatoire school in Greenwich, say . she will be disappointed that the photograph is back in circulation. One close friend said: ‘She is especially sensitive to exposure at the moment – she totally wants to avoid the limelight.’ Friends . say that Cressida’s sudden rise to fame after being linked to Harry . last summer could be the motivation behind the decision to resurrect the . photograph from the cutting-room floor. The . bikini she is modelling is no longer sold on the website owned by the . three founders – who were all at Newcastle University together at the . same time that Cressida was at Leeds University. Lauren . Skerritt told The Mail on Sunday: ‘That photo was taken a long time . ago. Cressida doesn’t model for us any more. I don’t think she will . really want the publicity from it.’ Nevertheless, last week the photograph of a waif-like Cressida, then aged 21, was being circulated on promotional flyers for the brand, which was founded in 2009. The flyer reads: ‘This card entitles you to 30 per cent off all Beautiful Bottoms collections’, although the style Cressida is wearing is no longer on sale on the website. Last week the flyers were being handed out in goody bags at a party in London hosted by another of Cressida’s friends, Daisy Fellowes, when she launched a collection of silk jackets for her fashion brand Lilah. Cressida was due to appear at the party but made a last-minute decision not to go. A friend at the event said: ‘Cress has now quietly hired an adviser to help navigate her way through all the attention surrounding her. She doesn’t want to be photographed at events right now. Young love: Prince Harry and the aspiring dancer were pictured sharing an intimate moment on a ski-ing break in Switzerland earlier this year . ‘She was very hurt and saddened by pictures of her drinking shots which emerged recently in a magazine, which were unfairly compared to Sarah Ferguson, who is a family friend. It was incredibly embarrassing and cruel. She was at university – who doesn’t drink shots at university?’ Another friend added: ‘Whether it works out between them or not, Harry will always adore Cressida and he is very protective of her. He would have been mortified that such a cheap comparison was made.’ And now it seems that by digging up the picture of Cressida in a bikini, her friends have increased the attention surrounding her. The silk underwear sold on the website, and in 19 UK concessions, is hand-made in China, and a set costs about £85. Upmarket: The Beautiful Bottoms lingerie company website shows a model stretched out in a two piece . Other celebrities to model for the company include Made In Chelsea’s Millie Mackintosh and TV presenter Abbey Clancy. A blog on the Beautiful Bottoms website, written by Lauren Skerritt in 2011, reads: ‘Poppy and I got a tour of the entire factory, including where they keep the silk cocoons before opening them and making them into fibres, the silk reems [sic], the dyeing room, and the sewing rooms where our Beautiful Bottoms come to life!’ Ambassadors: Models Abbey Clancy (left) and Millie Mackintosh (right) have modeled for the lingerie company . The ‘Prince Harry effect’ worked wonders for the modelling career of his previous girlfriend, Florence Brudenell-Bruce, who landed a lucrative contract with British handbag designer Aspinal of London shortly after their brief fling fizzled out in August 2011. She also fronted a campaign for underwear label La Senza. Cressida’s mother is Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon, 66, who was a society It Girl in her time. She was married to Cressida’s father, Jeffrey Bonas – chairman of old-fashioned haberdashers MacCulloch & Wallis – for six years.","Cressida Bonas, now an aspiring dancer posed for picture three years ago .

Winfield also posted an image of Hobson's bloodied finger which he had injured in the robbery and when a friend posted a link to an online article on a local news website about the raid, Hobson commented: 'Hehehe that's me.' Corey Hobson, 17, left, and Reece Winfield, 18, right, were sentenced to three years in a young offenders' institute after raiding a newsagent and boasting about their crime on Facebook . When the pair were arrested two days later, detectives were able to further link them to the crime because they were still wearing the same underwear as when the raid took place. Although that hapless duo's faces were obscured in CCTV footage taken from the shop, the waste bands of their underwear was clearly visible because of their low slung trousers. The teenagers were sentenced to 32 months for the robbery and four months each for another offence of attempted arson which emerged during the investigation into the robbery. Hapless: The pair were caught after they posted this picture of their loot just 500 yards away from the newsagents they raided . A judge at Nottingham Crown Court also ordered the pair to pay £120 each in compensation to the newsagent who received minor injuries and was left shaken by the incident. Both had pleaded guilty. Detective Sergeant Phil Sims, of Mansfield CID, said: 'These two made it very easy for us to track them down and, in the end, you could say they were well and truly caught with their pants down. 'They obviously thought it was funny to brag about their crime, sparing no thought for their victim, who they left battered and bruised and counting the cost of their theft and damage.' The pair also pleaded guilty to attempted arson after they filmed themselves lighting and throwing a home made petrol bomb into a Nottingham street two days before the newsagent robbery took place. Officers investigating the robbery found the video on Winfield's phone while investigating the raid. Inspector Andy Goodall said: 'While there was no damage or injuries caused by the explosion, Winfield and Hobson's actions showed a reckless disregard for their own and other people's safety. 'The fact that they filmed their exploits and laughed at the bang suggests they were pretty happy with themselves. 'I doubt they are laughing now. 'It is by no means big or clever to play with fire and certainly not risk the lives of others. Under no circumstances will we tolerate this sort of lawless, dangerous behaviour.' Hearing: The pair were jailed for an additional four months at Nottingham Crown Court for attempted arson after another offence emerged during the investigation into the robbery .","Reece Winfield and Corey Hobson raided a shop in Nottinghamshire .

The parents of a medical student killed by a banned slimming pill said yesterday she had been the happiest they had ever known. Geoff and Gina Houston said their daughter Sarah, 23, was beginning to conquer the eating disorders which had afflicted her for years. The fourth-year medical student, was about to be discharged by her psychiatrist after three years, they said. Today David Cameron promised to investigate what more can be done to warn people about the dangers of the slimming pills. Sarah Houston's family, who are all qualified doctors, pledged to lobby the Government to make DNP illegal after their daughter died after taking the drug . Tragedy: Sarah's Parents Geoff and Gina Houston said their daughter Sarah, 23, was beginning to conquer the eating disorders which had afflicted her for years before her death . Mr Houston, 55, who along with his . wife, son James, 29, and second daughter Vicky, 27, is a doctor, said . Miss Houston is thought to have taken the drug DNP for about 18 months. At his rural home, he said: ‘She . wasn’t depressed. She was the happiest we had known her. It was a . complete shock to us. It’s a tragedy that no parent should have to go . through.’ Miss Houston had been secretly taking . capsules of the drug, which is banned for human consumption but . available online as it is used as a pesticide. It has been linked to 62 . deaths worldwide. In private: Miss Houston had been secretly taking DNP capsules, which is banned for human consumption but available online . Fun-loving: 23-year-old Sarah, from Buckinghamshire, pictured having fun in India during a 2010 trip . Games: The medical student plays in the street with local children in Guatamala during a visit in July 2012 . Shame: Sarah was a beautiful, bright young woman, but always 'suffered from her image, her mother said . On Monday, coroner David Hinchliff . told an inquest it was ‘entirely’ responsible for her death last . September when she collapsed in her room at the University of Leeds. Mr Houston, of Chesham Bois, . Buckinghamshire, who is now a lay minister, said it may have only been a . single pill which killed her. ‘Nobody knew she was taking it, not even . her flatmates,’ he said. ‘It would be posted to her university address . in a brown paper bag.’ On the anorexia and bulimia which . affected her from the age of 14, he added:  ‘There was light at the end . of the tunnel in terms of her wanting to get better. She was a great . fighter against this and she had made a lot of progress.’ ‘She was the happiest she had ever been. She was a bright medical student in her fourth year and loving it.’ His wife, 55, a retired pharmacologist, called for manufacturers to stop producing DNP, which boosts metabolism, as capsules. ‘Why are people selling it in capsule form, if they are not expecting people to take it as a dietary aid?’ she said. Mantra: Sarah kept this handwritten note next to her bed at home . The medical student was found dead in her bedroom by a flatmate the day after refusing to call an ambulance when she felt hot and unwell . DNP (pictured right) is sold as a weight loss aid, but has been described as 'extremely dangerous to human health' by doctors. It is sold mostly over the internet under a number of different names but contains 2, 4-Dinitrophenol. It is marketed mainly to bodybuilders as a weight loss aid as it is thought to dramatically boost metabolism. The manufactured drug is yellow and odourless and was previously used as a herbicide and fungicide. It was launched as a slimming aid in the U.S. in the 1930s but then banned in 1938, due to the severe side-effects. Depending on the amount consumed, signs of acute poisoning could include nausea, vomiting, restlessness, flushed skin, sweating, dizziness, headaches, rapid respiration and irregular heart-beat, possibly leading to coma and death. ‘If it is only sold in liquid form, you could use it in industry but you could not use it as a dieting aid. ‘I’m sure that Sarah would not have . taken it if it had not been sold as capsules.’ Mr Houston said: ‘It is . morally repugnant to package it in capsules. If there is an ounce of . moral integrity, then these people selling it should stop immediately.’ The coroner also demanded a crackdown, saying manufacturers knew the capsules were being bought for weight control. Miss Houston was a confident and popular young woman with a strong Christian faith who did well at the local grammar school. Her mother added: ‘She was a normal, . healthy weight. She was a beautiful girl and popular with the boys. But . she always suffered from her image. ‘This generation are under a lot of pressure, with the fashion models, the images you see in the press. ‘She was very bright and bubbly, she . had lots of friends.

Max Clifford (pictured speaking to media yesterday outside his home in Surrey) has been charged with 11 counts of indecent assault . PR guru Max Clifford last night vowed to clear his name after being charged with a string of indecent assaults against teenage girls. The 70-year-old publicist will face trial over 11 claims of sexual abuse against seven girls and young women, aged between 14 and 19. Within minutes of the charges being revealed, he appeared on television to deny the accusations. He was arrested in December in connection with Operation Yewtree, the police inquiry set up after Jimmy Savile was exposed as a predatory paedophile with more than 450 victims. Clifford said the allegations were ‘completely false’ and vowed to ‘clear my name in a court of law’. He was charged after he answered police bail and will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on May 28. The charges span a 19-year period between 1966 and 1985. The Crown Prosecution Service found there was insufficient evidence to bring charges in relation to three other allegations. Clifford said he was ‘living a 24/7 nightmare’. He added: ‘The allegations in respect of which I have been charged are completely false and I have made this clear to the police during many, many hours of interviews. ‘Nevertheless a decision has been taken to charge me with 11 offences involving seven women, the most recent of which is 28 years ago and the oldest 47 years ago. I have never indecently assaulted anyone in my life and this will become clear during the course of the proceedings. ‘I am naturally disappointed. However, at least I will now be in a position to fully consider all the evidence against me and to answer the evidence in public and ultimately clear my name in a court of law. ‘Since last December I have been living a 24/7 nightmare. A black cloud has been placed over me, obliterating the bright blue skies that I have been fortunate to live my life under for the vast majority of the past 70 years. ‘Fortunately I have and continue to receive wonderful support and understanding from those who knew me, those who know me, as well as people I meet everywhere I go.’ Police have arrested a string of celebrities as part of Operation Yewtree, including convicted paedophile Gary Glitter, comics Freddie Starr and Jim Davidson, presenter Rolf Harris and DJ Dave Lee Travis. All deny any wrongdoing. Clifford (pictured, left, as a teenager and, right, outside his home yesterday) said 'a black cloud has been placed over me' since December . Clifford last night said the allegations were 'completely false' and vowed to 'clear my name in a court of law' Clifford (pictured following his arrest in December) is one of 12 people arrested under Operation Yewtree . There are three strands to the Yewtree investigation – two involving Savile, and a third termed ‘Others’. Clifford falls into this third category, meaning he was not being questioned about anything connected to Savile. Clifford has been a vocal commentator on the Savile scandal, and before his arrest he said a lot of ageing stars were worried about being dragged into the investigation. He said at least 15 big name stars from the 1960s and 70s had contacted him because they had lived a hedonistic lifestyle where young girls threw themselves at them, but they ‘never asked for anybody’s birth certificate’. Rolf Harris (left), arrested last month, has been painting 'every day' to deal with the trauma of being accused of sexual offences. Freddie Starr (right) was arrested for a second time earlier this week by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile sex scandal . ‘It is a situation which could easily . turn into a witch-hunt,’ he said. ‘Where is it going to end? I hope . they (the police) concentrate on finding people like Jimmy Savile who . were manipulating girls.’ Clifford . represented the rich and famous for 40 years, his website boasts, and . he is considered to be almost as famous as those he represents. His first wife, Liz, died of cancer in 2003 and he married his former PA Jo Westwood in 2010. He has a daughter, Louise, 41. Alison . Saunders, chief crown prosecutor for CPS London, said: ‘We have . concluded that there is sufficient evidence  and it is in the public . interest for Mr Clifford to be charged with 11 offences of indecent . assault relating to seven complainants.’ Max Clifford was arrested in December as part of the inquiry sparked by abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile (pictured) Speaking outside his home today, . Clifford said: 'The allegations in respect of which I have been charged . are completely false, very upsetting, very distressing, but completely . false. 'I have made it clear to the police . during probably around 25 hours of interviews since last December when I . was initially arrested, that there's absolutely no truth and substance . in any of these allegations.' He added: 'I'm so grateful to the . many people that I meet everywhere I go who have been so supportive to . me and since this charge being announced in the last couple of hours . I've literally had hundreds of calls to my office, to friends, to . myself, to my wife, to family members, and everyone of them has been . nothing but supportive. 'Twenty-eight years ago was this most recent (allegation), and 47 years ago was the oldest. 'That's what I'm up against and that's what I've now got to - with my legal team - face up to and sort out to clear my name.'

Lord Laird has referred himself to House of Lords standards watchdogs over his contact with a fake lobbying company . Westminster's new ‘cash for questions’ row deepened last night after a second politician admitted being caught up in the sting that forced Tory MP Patrick Mercer to resign the party whip. Ulster Unionist peer Lord Laird confirmed that he had been approached by two BBC journalists posing as consultants for fictitious consultancy firm Alistair Andrews Communications. The Mail on Sunday understands he will feature with Mr Mercer in a Panorama exposé due to be broadcast this week. The former PR executive insisted he had not broken any rules because he had never agreed to act on the fake consultancy’s behalf, nor accepted any money. But Lord Laird revealed he had referred himself to House of Lords standards watchdogs and to Black Rod, the House’s senior official. Lord Laird said last night: ‘In recent days, I have been the subject of a scam operated by journalists masquerading as communications consultants. ‘This has led to allegations that I have broken the rules of the House of Lords. 'I wish to make it clear that I did not agree that I would act as a paid advocate in any proceedings of the House nor did I accept payment or other incentive or reward in return for providing parliamentary advice or services to the Society of Friends of Fiji. ‘I do not believe that I have broken any rules. ‘However, I have referred myself to Black Rod’s office and to the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards, and I will be making no further statement until I have received their ruling.’ Mr Mercer, a former Tory frontbencher, resigned the party whip last week after he was accused of taking £4,000 to lobby and ask parliamentary questions on behalf of Fiji. The MP for Newark is also accused of agreeing to provide a parliamentary pass for a fictional member of the Fijian government. Patrick Mercer MP has quit the Tory party over allegations he took £4,000 from a fake lobbying company and did not declare his interest . Mr Mercer said he was taking legal advice on the allegations but had resigned the whip ‘to save my party embarrassment’. He announced he would stand down at the next Election but is facing pressure from Tory colleagues to quit now – even though a by-election could mean losing a rock-solid seat to UKIP. The row has led to fresh calls on David Cameron to introduce a ‘right of recall’ allowing voters to sack misbehaving MPs and to set up an official register of lobbyists.","Lord Laird has referred himself to watchdogs over his contact with fake lobbying company set up by undercover journalist .

The Guardsmen were killed . and two more people wounded in a shooting spree at a Nevada IHOP restaurant Tuesday morning, which left a total of five people dead and seven . hurt. Dozens of 911 calls made from in and . around the Nevada IHOP illustrate a terrifying scene as witnesses . described the gunman who killed four, before turning his automatic . weapon on himself. Killed: Sgt. 1st Class Miranda McElhiney . Killed: Sgt. 1st Class Christian Riege . Killed: Major Heath Kelly . Dispatchers are heard trying to establish whether than one person was involved in the deadly rampage. Fatal shootout: Eduardo Sencion, 32, opened fire at the restaurant, killing four people and wounding seven others before fatally shooting himself . The dead included three Nevada National Guard members, identified Wednesday as: Sgt. 1st Class Christian Riege, 38, of Carson City; Major Heath Kelly, 35, of Reno; and Sgt. 1st Class Miranda McElhiney, 31, of Reno. Also killed was Florence Donovan-Gunderson, 67, of South Lake Tahoe. After the killings, the gunman, 32-year-old Eduardo Sencion, turned the AK-47 on himself. On tapes released Wednesday, desperate callers describe how victims are being gunned down in front of them inside the restaurant. One caller said: 'In the IHOP! In the IHOP!'. 'Now he’s coming back out with a gun shooting people in the parking lot!'. In another call, a man said, 'Automatic weapons. IHOP. Automatic weapons.' 'He's shooting at us now,' the man screamed, to a background of gunfire. In interviews with investigators after the shooting, Sencion's family raised concerns about his mental health. The attack took place at the pancake chain's restaurant in Carson City at around 9am on Tuesday. The fourth fatality was a female civilian. A group of five military personnel were wearing their Nevada National Guard uniforms for a breakfast meeting when Sencion struck. Authorities were not saying whether . Sencion targeted the Guard members but security at all bases in Northern . Nevada was stepped up in response. Carson City Sheriff Kenny Furlong said Sencion worked at his family's business in South Lake Tahoe. He was not in the military, and he had no known affiliations with anyone at the restaurant. Sencion also had no criminal history. At least one of the Guard . members killed was a woman, authorities said. Sencion was born in Mexico and had a valid U.S. passport. Witnesses said the gunman pulled up . outside the IHOP in a blue minivan at just before 9am, with a yellow 'Support Our Troops' sticker on the back, and shot a woman on a . motorcycle, then walked inside the restaurant. Sencion went all the way to the back of the restaurant where the Guards were sitting and opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle. Shooting: Emergency personnel respond to the massacre at the IHOP restaurant in Carson City, Nevada . After several minutes inside the IHOP, he walked outside and . began firing into the Locals Barbecue and an H&R Block in the strip . mall. Two of the four fatalities died at the scene. A third died during surgery and the fourth later. Carson . City Sheriff Kenny Furlong said the suspected gunman was found by . authorities in the IHOP parking lot, having 'already self-inflicted a . wound'. Carson City Sheriff's Office have confirmed the suspected shooter died in hospital in Reno. Chief Deputy Jack Freer said: 'The suspect did die of a self inflicted gunshot wound. No shots were fired by law enforcement.' Sheriff Furlong said there were . concerns at the outset that the gunman was not working alone and the . state Capitol and Supreme Court buildings were locked down for about 40 . minutes in response. But that turned out not to be the case. 'There . does not appear to be any safety concerns outside of this area,' he . said. 'It appears to be isolated to this parking lot.' Aftermath: With bullet holes seen in a window, officers look for evidence at the scene . Semi-automatic weapon: Officers look through a bullet-damaged window of the restaurant . National . Highway Patrol Trooper Chuck Allen said extra security measures have . been put in place on state and military buildings in northern Nevada as a . safety precaution. 'As you know when you have people in uniform who are randomly targeted for whatever reason this may have been, it is a safety precaution we take very seriously,' he said. Some victims have been transported by Careflight to Renown in Reno. Others have been transported to Carson-Tahoe Medical Center. It was not clear where exactly the shooter was taken. Ralph Swagler, owner of Locals Barbecue in the same strip mall as the . IHOP, told the Reno . Gazette-Journal that he saw the entire incident. 'This happens in third-world countries, not here,' Mr Swagler said. 'I wish I had shot at him when he was going in the IHOP. 'But when he came at me, when somebody is pointing an automatic weapon at you - you can't believe the firepower, the kind of rounds coming out of that weapon.' Shocking: Emergency personnel respond to the shooting at the pancake house which left at least three dead . Consultation: Local and state police as well as FBI agents descended on the location of the shooting . Local and state police and FBI agents descended on the scene on South Carson Street, also called U.S. 395. Yellow tape surrounded the parking . lot at the restaurant, which is near a Kohl’s department store and . across the street from a casino and hotel. At least 11 agencies, both federal and state, are working the scene, Sheriff Furlong said. Renown Regional Medicare Center . spokesman Dan Davis said four victims of the shooting were being treated . at the hospital in Reno, but he said he could not discuss their . condition or provide any other information. Kurt Althof, public relations manager . for Care Flight, told the Reno Gazette-Journal three victims had been taken . to the hospital by helicopter and that two were in critical condition. Fran Hunter, who works at Sierra Le Bone, a pet shop, just north of the IHOP, was having breakfast at the Casino Fandango when the gunman attacked, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported. As she came out of the casino, two men on motorcycles said they heard shots. Victim: The body of a shooting victim covered with a sheet lies on the front lawn of the IHOP restaurant . Ms Hunter said Sencion came out of IHOP and shot out the windows of the barbecue place. He fired shot at least two shots toward Casino Fandango. 'I was standing in front of Fandango, and somebody said, ""Oh he shot himself,""' Ms Hunter told the Reno Gazette-Journal. 'I don't know what's happening to my city,' she said. 'This happens in LA or Las Vegas but not here.' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, has released a statement reading: 'I'm deeply saddened by this senseless act and extend my sympathies to those afflicted this morning. 'I applaud the first responders for their professionalism, and my thoughts are with the victims and their families during this difficult time.' Sheriffs are interviewing more than 100 witnesses at the scene. Jayne Peters of Carson City was taking a tax class at H&R Block with five other students when the shooting started. 'Just as we were starting, I heard a pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, and I said: ""Is that automatic gunfire?""' she told the Reno Gazette-Journal. Ms Peters said her instructor looked out the window and saw a man with a gun and told all the students to get into the back of the office. The instructor said the shooter first shot at Casino Fandango across the street, then went into the IHOP. When Sencion exited the IHOP, he opened fire again. The blasts shattered the glass door of H&R Block. 'I kept thinking he was in our building,' Ms Peters told the Reno Gazette-Journal. 'We were just huddled in the bathroom in the dark. It was really scary.'","Dozens of 911 calls made as gunman began his deadly rampage .

Eastern European migrants are more likely to have jobs than native Britons, a research study revealed yesterday. The finding is in contrast with other countries with high levels of immigration from Eastern Europe, where the reverse is true. Researchers found that in the UK, workers from the countries that joined the EU in 2004 and later were 7 per cent more likely to be in work than British-born people. A research study has revealed Eastern European migrants are more likely to have jobs than native Britons . But in Germany, the Netherlands and Finland locally-born workers have a higher employment rate than migrant workers from the new EU countries, the study said. The report, by two Finnish academics, was presented yesterday to a conference on migration at University College London organised by NORFACE, a European organisation of state-funded research councils. It said that while Eastern European workers in Britain are more likely to have jobs than locals, their jobs are often among the most low paid. This appears to support the long-held argument that many migrants are more willing to take low-paid jobs than those of British birth. As early as 2007, official figures showed that four out of five newly-created jobs were going to migrants. The findings that migrants are filling vacant jobs while many British people draw the dole comes as a heated debate rages over welfare spending. The debate has been inflamed by the case of benefit-dependent Mick Philpott who was jailed for life for killing six of his children in a house fire. David Cameron and George Osborne expressed concerns in the wake of the case that the welfare system subsidises worklessness and feckless behaviour. The findings come as a heated debate rages over welfare spending. David Cameron and George Osborne (pictured) have expressed concerns, in the wake of the Mick Philpott case, that the welfare system subsidises worklessness and feckless behaviour . This month has seen the introduction of a string of benefit reforms intended to make a life on benefits less attractive and to make it more worthwhile for claimants to look for low-paid work. The Finnish report, by Mari Kangasniemi and Merja Kauhanen, said that one of the key factors affecting the job chances of Eastern European migrants is labour market conditions in the countries to which they move. They said: ‘We find that Eastern European immigrants had a lower probability of employment on average in comparison to natives in all other countries except for the UK during the period 2004 to 2009.’ According to the findings, Eastern European migrants were 16.1 per cent less likely to be employed than locals in the Netherlands, where workers from Poland and the seven other countries that joined the EU in 2004 were allowed to work freely in 2008. In Finland, where Eastern Europeans could work from 2007, they were 5.7 per cent less likely to have a job than locals. Germany kept strict restrictions on Eastern European workers until 2011, but in the period covered by the report Eastern European workers who did move to Germany were around 11 per cent less likely than Germans to have a job. ‘In the UK, the employment gap in favour of new member state immigrants is around 7 percentage points,’ the report found.","Eastern Europeans 7 per cent more likely to be in work than British people .

No offence: Simon Cowell said it hadn't been his intention for the J-Lo performance to be 'deliberately sleazy' Britain’s Got Talent supremo Simon Cowell has defended Jennifer Lopez’s risqué appearance on the show, blaming a cameraman for getting ‘carried away.’ Cowell, 53, was responding to criticism of J-Lo’s appearance on Tuesday’s semi-final, which saw her perform wearing a leather leotard and thigh-high boots and triggered more than 100 complaints to regulator Ofcom. Cowell admitted the footage could have appeared shocking to viewers but insisted it wasn’t his intention to be ‘deliberately sleazy’. He said: ‘I think the cameraman got a bit carried away. When I was watching it in the studio, I wasn’t aware of some of the close-ups. It’s kind of worse in close-up. 'We are aware it is a family show. We never set out to deliberately cause offence.’ The broadcasting regulator is now considering whether to investigate the programme, after receiving dozens of complaints. Thousands of viewers took to Twitter to express their outrage, with some saying the singer looked like a ‘prostitute’. Even the show’s co-host Anthony McPartlin appeared taken aback, glancing at her outfit after the performance and raising his eyebrows. Only judge Amanda Holden seemed to be a fan, declaring: ‘JLo’s a***. I just wanted to bite it. It was fabulous’. Miss Lopez’s act was shown after the 9pm watershed during the Britain’s Got Talent results show on Tuesday. But lobby group Mediawatch UK said the programme had deliberately targeted younger viewers by screening the episode during the half-term holiday. Controversial: Thousands of Twitter users voiced complaint at J-Lo's performance on Britain's Got Talent . Its director . Vivienne Pattinson said: ‘Parents will have been more likely to let . their children stay up beyond their normal bedtimes. ‘And given the main . show is incredibly popular with children, lots of them will have wanted . to stay up a bit later to find out who won. It was totally . inappropriate to show something like this, given their audience. It . seems as if they never learn.’ Cowell’s comments came after a week of controversy for BGT. On Thursday, Sir Bruce Forsyth called on Cowell to stop auditioning children, claiming it was unfair to place youngsters under the pressure of performing on live television. Even the show's co-host Anthony McPartlin looked shocked by the singer's outfit . Last night, Cowell branded the  comments ‘ridiculous’ and accused the star – who launched his own career at the London Palladium aged 14 – of double standards. ‘If Bruce Forsyth was sitting in front of me now, I’d ask him how old was he at his first audition? Maybe we’ll try and find some footage. The trouble is I don’t think there were cameras in those days,’ he said. ‘I’m used to criticism, but I always seem to get criticism from people who’ve made their career, made their money, and then start saying shows like ours shouldn’t exist. It’s kind of like, “Well I’ve made it, but other people can’t.” It’s completely hypocritical. That’s what frustrates me.’","Performance in leather leotard and thigh-high boots sparked more than 100 complaints to Ofcom .

But Natalie Massenet has now revealed how hard it was to launch her successful online fashion business when she was pregnant with her first child. Natalie Massenet is considered one of the few woman to have been able to have it all. Pictured with Caroline Rush (R) CEO of BFC and Samantha Cameron . The 47-year-old entrepreneur, named as one of the world’s most influential women in February, created her online fashion empire Net-a-porter more than a decade ago, when shopping via a keyboard was in its infancy. Net-a-Porter was reported to be worth £350 million two years ago. Speaking at the Vogue Fashion Festival at the weekend, Mrs Massenet, who at the time was pregnant with Isabella, now 13, said: ‘At the same time when I started writing the business plan I was also pregnant. And I think fuelled by hormones and delusions that if I could build a baby why not a business? Massenet is now one of the most successful businesswomen in Britain. With editor, Dylan Jones and Prime Minister David Cameron . The businesswoman said that even now she has to pinch herself. With Kate Reardon and Lisa BLaunch at party for Vanity Fair's 'On Couture' ‘I made a dreadful mistake or opportunity I’m not sure, of doing both of them at the same time, and it was enormously hard. Actually having a business that I loved and a baby that I loved at the same time kept me enormously balanced.’ She joked: ‘I was so traumatised by having a baby and starting a business in the same year that it took six years for the next one to come along'. Following the success of her website Massenet now hobnobs with the rich and powerful, such as Victoria Beckham . Mrs Massenet, who is divorced from her French investment banker husband Arnaud Massenet, gave birth to another girl, Ava, and she jokes that she was ‘building the Net a Porter future consumer base one at a time.’ Mrs Massenet began her business with a team of 15 from an apartment in Chelsea, London. They worked from one bedroom and used the spare as a distribution centre, taking orders via a nineties laptop connected to dial-up internet. Today 5 million people visit the site’s weekly magazine and 2,600 people are employed. Mrs Massenet has offices in the UK, US and Hong Kong. She said she still has to ‘pinch herself’ every now and again. ‘While we were in this little rickety apartment in Chelsea and while we had all of our stuff stacked in the back and only 15 people in the room we put all of our energy to what the consumer saw and aimed big, wanted to make people think this was a big company,’ she said. ‘There is no recipe for success, it’s as unique and individual as you are,’ she added. ‘People always ask is it hard being an entrepreneur and a mum and the answer is yes. 'But the reality is women do it all the time and thankfully we have mentors and women around us who can inspire us.’","Natalie Massenet launched Net-a-porter when she was pregnant .

Neon Roberts, who is seven, has had radiotherapy and will start chemotherapy for his brain tumour next month . The father of a seven-year-old boy who was taken on the run by his mother to spare him the ordeal of radiotherapy has hit back at her claims that the life-saving treatment had ‘broken’ him. Ben Roberts, 34, insisted their son Neon, who has completed 30 sessions of radiotherapy following the removal of a large brain tumour last year, was making good progress and that doctors were ‘cautiously optimistic’ that he would make a full recovery. Mr Roberts reacted after his estranged wife Sally, 37, who lost a high- profile legal battle to stop her son receiving the treatment, claimed that radiotherapy had damaged Neon irreparably. In December, Mrs Roberts fled with her son to prevent him being given the treatment following the removal of the tumour in October. She argued that radiotherapy could cause him to suffer serious side effects such as stunted growth and infertility, and wanted to be allowed to pursue alternative treatments. The High Court, however, dismissed her case after doctors advised the child would die within three months if he was denied the ‘gold standard’ treatment. The court said her judgment had ‘gone awry’. Yesterday, Mr Roberts, from West London, said Neon was having a short break from treatment before starting chemotherapy in early April. He acknowledged that his son had suffered side effects such as tiredness, but said these were to be expected in the short term. Neon's mother Sally, left, is fighting her son's treatment but her estranged husband Ben supports the doctors . His wife, a New Zealander who now lives in Brighton, claimed this week that Neon was ‘grey and fragile’ and ‘not the boy I know any more’. She added: ‘I look into my little boy’s eyes and there is nothing there. 'I see this child who was always laughing and happy sitting with his little head in his hands crying. ‘The thing that scared me most was that the radiation would change him, damage him – and it has done both.’ Sally Roberts and Daybreak's Dr Hilary Jones disagreed over the best treatment for Ms Roberts' son Neon yesterday . Happier times: Little Neon and his mother Sally Roberts before he was diagnosed with a brain tumour . A combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy gives young patients up to an 86 per cent chance of survival. But delays in Neon’s treatment cut his  chances of surviving to 67 per cent. The High Court ordered that he lives with his father during his treatment, and Mrs Roberts, who spent Christmas away from her son and his twin sister, Elektra, is prohibited from removing him from her estranged husband’s care. Short-term side effects can include:Tiredness, which may last for several months after the treatment is over.Nausea can be a problem for many people, although doctors can prescribe anti-sickness drugs to helpWeight loss can result from feeling sick or as a result of the treatment itself.Skin colour and texture can be affected, and patients can develop sores, itchiness or rashes.  Radiotherapy patients should also avoid being outside in bright sun for a year after treatment and cover up in sunshine.Hair loss tends to develop two to three weeks after the treatment and it may take several months to grow back. There are risks to the patient having radiotherapy but most are small and short-term, and are far outweighed by the benefits . Bone marrow can be affected by radiotherapy and this will be monitored by doctors.Longer-term side effects are rare but can include:Hair-loss or change of colour or textureSkin becoming darker or changing in textureInfertility if the ovaries or testicles were in the treatment areaSwelling in a limb (lymphoedema) can occur when lymph nodes are damagedRed spidery marks (telangectasia) may appear on the skinShortness of breath, narrowing of the vagina, and narrowing of the oesophagus can occur as these areas become less stretchy Passing a lot of urine can happen if the bladder becomes less stretchy . Second cancers can very rarely be caused by radiotherapy but doctors say the risks of this happening are far outweighed by the potential benefits of the treatment.

Cleared: Andrew Machin, 40, has become one of the first men in the UK top be acquitted of rape because he suffers from sexsomnia . A ‘sexsomniac’ wept as he was cleared of raping a drunk 21-year-old after telling jurors he had been asleep when he assaulted her. Andrew Machin, 40, admitted having sex with the woman without her consent at a Butlins holiday camp after putting her to bed following a night out with friends. But he was acquitted after claiming to have a sleep disorder that causes him to have sex unintentionally. Breaking down in court, he said the case had been a nightmare and both he and the girl were victims. His lawyer said he had, in fact, been ‘a knight in shining armour’ to the victim. The case is the latest of a growing number reaching the courts in which rape defendants have argued that they cannot be held accountable for their actions because they suffer from the unusual sleep condition, known as parasomnia or sexsomnia. Machin, from Warsop in Nottinghamshire, met the girl during a seven-hour drinking binge at Butlins in Skegness on February 27, 2010. She was on a weekend away with nine other women, some of whom knew Machin. Having downed more than  20 alcopops and shots at an Eighties revival club night, the woman collapsed and was so drunk she could barely speak and could not stand up. After helping her back to her chalet, a friend undressed her and left her with Machin, agreeing that he should stay the night in case she became ill. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, then fell asleep but woke to find him naked in her bed having sex with her. ‘I was still drunk,’ she said. ‘I started to panic when I realised what was happening. I couldn’t think properly. I put my hands up and shouted to him to stop. I was shaking.’ Trial: Mr Machin admitted the 21-year-old woman did not consent to sex but he was cleared by jurors at Lincoln Crown Court after revealing he suffers from sexsomnia . Machin, who has been unemployed for . four years after injuring his back, said he was ‘disgusted’ when he woke . up and realised what he had done. He told Lincoln Crown Court he had . been blighted by sleep problems for more than 25 years and that he . regularly had sex with his long-term partner while asleep. He said on the night in question he simply wanted to help the woman. ‘I just wanted to go to sleep. I didn’t know where I was when I woke up. I was all over the place,’ he said, in tears. ‘All I wanted to do was help her. I didn’t want to hurt her. I feel disgusted. It is difficult to describe how I feel.’ Machin’s partner, Denise Jacks, 38, said he had undressed her and had sex with her before while sleeping. ‘It’s like he’s hypnotised and someone’s got the remote control on. He’s disgusted with himself. He just can’t help it.’ His sister, Kathy Pickering, told the jury the condition runs in their family. She said: ‘I have sleep sex. I . discovered that when I was married. My husband told me about it. I’m not . aware. I’ve no recollection of what I’ve done or what I’ve said.’ DISTRESS OF SEXSOMNIA.jpg . Dr Irshaad Ebrahim, a psychiatrist . from the London Sleep Clinic, told the court the condition often affects . those who have a family history of sleep disorders, including sleep . walking. Michael Auty QC, defending, said: ‘He was in so many ways a genuine knight in shining armour to this woman. ‘This is on any view an extremely unusual set of circumstances. ‘Parasomnia is real and for people who suffer from it, it is desperately real.’ Stephen Lowne, prosecuting, said Machin lied about the incident and knew that what he was doing was wrong. The woman added: ‘If it was sex that I . wanted I would have gone out and found it and done it and not said a . word to anybody, but I didn’t.’ Machin wept as the jury foreman read out the not guilty verdict, following three days of deliberation. Later, he said: ‘I am deeply sorry . for all the heartache and hurt that has been caused by the unfortunate . set of circumstances that were beyond my control. There have always been . two victims in this case. ‘I am glad that the right decision . has been made and now I can get on with my life, because the last three . years have been a nightmare.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Andrew Machin, 40, was accused of raping drunk 21-year-old after night out .

Their plans for a futuristic £5million eco-home - complete with a sound-proofed cinema, solar panelled pods and a garish waterfall - were never going to be to everyone's taste. And it seems lottery millionaires Matt and Cassey Topham's new neighbours in upmarket Adams Hill in Nottinghamshire are distinctly unimpressed. After the Mail yesterday revealed how the young couple are planning to spend part of the £45million they scooped on the lottery on a bizarre new mansion, those living in the surrounding houses raised their eyebrows at the plans. The £1.2 million house in Nottingham will be transformed into an eight bedroom eco-home named 'Serenity' The couple will move into a far larger home than their previous one. Their new property appeared as 'Wayne Manor' in the latest Batman film The Dark Knight Rises . Neighbours described the home as being 'very out of character for the area' and looking like 'a collection of turtles'. Former painter and decorator Matt, 24, and his new wife Cassey, 23, a former Iceland supermarket supervisor, were described as 'lucky people with bad taste'. After winning the Euromillions in February 2012, the newlyweds, who were living in a £89,950 ex-council house in Stapleford, Nottinghamshire, announced they would spend some of the money on a 'dream home'. Within seven months, the Tophams had bought a 1930s mansion in Adams Hill, Nottingham, for £1.2million - which they now plan to demolish to make way for their new home, a £5million eight bedroom eco-home named 'Serenity'. Proposals for the house, which were lodged with the local authority on Thursday, outline how the property will boast a sound-proof cinema, a botanical garden and a swimming pool. EuroMillions winners Matt and Cassey Topham plan an eight-bedroom mansion with waterfall-screened garage and grotto swimming pool . Neighbours described the home as being 'very out of character for the area' and looking like 'a collection of turtles' Baca, the London-based architects behind the design, have described the property as a '21st century country house and hidden retreat' The home will include four wings or 'hubs' covered in solar panels, a dramatic sweeping staircase inside, and a garage with space for 10 cars. There they will keep their expanding collection of vehicles, including a Jaguar XKR-S and Range Rover Evoque, which are worth a combined £150,000. Mr Topham is also said to have bought a Porsche and an Aston Martin DB9 to replace the Peugeot 107 the couple used to share. The cars will be hidden by a waterfall of rainwater, which will flow from one pool at the centre of the mansion to a second pool below. The home, said to be fit for a Bond villain, will also back onto the grounds of a stunning country house which appeared as 'Wayne Manor' in the latest Batman film The Dark Knight Rises. Baca, the London-based architects behind the design, have described the property as a '21st century country house and hidden retreat' which is 'ultra-low in energy use but also high in aesthetic aspiration and quality'. Lottery winners Matt Topham and Cassey Carrington have planned to create a home which neighbours are disgusted by . After winning the Euromillions in February 2012, the newlyweds announced they would spend some of the money on a 'dream home' But locals in the exclusive neighbourhood of Adams Hill, Nottingham, said it looked 'tasteless' and 'disgusting'. Houses on the road, one of the most sought after in the area, sell for an average of £1.4million. Princess Diana stayed at a house there in 1990 when Prince Charles was receiving treatment at the nearby Queen's Medical Centre hospital for an elbow he damaged while playing polo. Housewife Lina Alamoudia, 30, said of the Tophams' new home: 'I don't like it at all. It looks like a collection of turtles. It is very out of character for the area. 'It is very unusual. With all that money they could have designed something far prettier. I haven't met them, or seen them at all since they moved in. They are lucky people with bad taste.' Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'It might be an eco-home and good for the environment but it looks pretty disgusting to me. 'It certainly isn't my cup of tea, and I think that would go for most people around here too.' A Nottingham City Council spokesman confirmed that an application had been received to demolish the Tophams' current home and build a new property on the site. He said its fate would be decided in July, adding: 'Planning officials have not had time to scrutinize the plans in detail but preliminary discussions have already taken place. 'The formal process of examining the application has now begun. Among the issues to be examined are any impact the new property would have on the surrounding area, including people who live locally.'","Matt and Cassey Topham described as 'lucky couple with bad taste'

The nation's busiest roads could be resurfaced with rubber from used car tyres resulting in a quieter drive . If you are driven to distraction by the noisy traffic outside your house, this could be the road to a good night’s sleep. Recycled car tyres could soon be used to surface roads across the country after a pioneering trial found they made roads quieter. One of the busiest roads in Scotland was resurfaced last year with the asphalt, containing shredded rubber from old tyres. Tests were performed on grip and skid resistance, with engineers reporting that the rubber road, on a stretch of dual carriageway between Perth and Dundee, resulted in a quieter drive. The surface is also more environmentally friendly. Since 2006, EU rules have banned the disposal of tyres in landfill sites, leaving about 480,000 tonnes of recyclable shredded rubber each year. Experts claim the road requires less maintenance and still allows for drainage, while tyre recyclers claim the technique will also save money because the new material is thinner than standard roads. Rubber roads were first built in the 1960s in the US, where today there are 20,000 miles of road made of recycled tyres. Rubber roads are also popular in China, Brazil, Spain and Germany. The technique has been found to cut traffic noise by about 25 per cent. The asphalt is made by breaking down used tyres into rubber ‘crumbs’ which are added to bitumen and crushed stone, which are typically used to make asphalt. EU rules have banned the disposal of tyres in landfill sites, leaving about 480,000 tonnes of recyclable shredded rubber each year . Experts say it makes roads quieter because the rubber thickens the bitumen – the binding agent which keeps the crushed stones together – allowing the road surface to trap and disperse sound waves. The rubber material is also springy and absorbs sound. Reducing road noise could save lives. According to the World Health Organisation, around one heart attack in every 50 in European countries is caused by chronic exposure to loud traffic. It can also cause mental health problems and hormonal imbalances. A spokesman for Transport Scotland said: ‘This adopts a sustainable approach in making the best use of resources available, by re-using an abundant waste material.’","Recycled car tyres could soon be used to .

A woman searching for April Jones on the morning after she disappeared saw Mark Bridger on a hill close to his home clutching a black bin bag. Carwen Sheen was driving with a friend at around 9am on October 2 looking for the five-year-old when she saw the former abattoir worker holding the bag close to his Land Rover, which he had left by the side of the road with its door open and the engine still running. The bag was rolled up in his hand, with the end hanging down, and today the witness told the court: 'There was something in it, not very big,'. April vanished while playing with her friend near their homes in Machynlleth, Powys, Mid Wales, on October 1 last year. The prosecution say April was abducted by Mark Bridger, 47, who drove her off in his Land Rover and murdered her . She recognised Bridger and added: 'I was driving down and I came round the corner and I've seen his vehicle with the door open. 'I was with a friend. She made a comment: ""What's he doing there?"" 'I've seen him coming down the side of the bank. He was holding a black bin bag. It was like it was wrapped up. 'It was rolled up. It was wrapped like a sausage. There was a bit at the end hanging down like it hadn't been tucked in properly. 'We spoke in the car and then Mark just drove past and that was the last I'd seen of him.' Mrs Sheen saw Bridger on a road close to Ceinws, where he was living at the time. The defendant nodded in the dock as the black bin bag was discussed and mouthed the word 'yes' when his barrister, Brendan Kelly QC, confirmed with the witness that she had seen the black bin bag in his hand. The court also heard from a neighbour who saw Bridger reversing into his drive after April went missing the previous evening. Paul and Coral Jones arrived today at Mold Crown Court to hear more evidence in Mark Bridger's trial . His employer Cheryl Harper also gave evidence, saying she met him on the following morning. They discussed the fact that the community was out searching for the schoolgirl, who suffered from cerebral palsy, she added. A local postman also spoke to Bridger, telling the court he 'asked him if he had seen and heard about the news'. 'He [Bridger] appeared quite shocked. He asked me what sort of vehicle they were looking for,' the postman added. A witness to the conversation said Mark claimed not to have seen the news because he did not have a television. 'Mark looked genuinely surprised,' the man added. The heartbroken parents of April, Paul and Coral Jones arrived in court today to hear more evidence in the trial, both sported pink ribbons that they had begun wearing when their daughter disappeared. The evidence comes after a schoolgirl told how alleged killer Mark Bridger asked her for a sleepover on the day April went missing. The murder trial jury heard how the 10-year-old girl said she was approached by Bridger just hours before April vanished outside her home. Former abbatoir worker Bridger allegedly asked the girl - a friend of his daughter - if she wanted to sleep over at his house. CCTV shows April Jones at a leisure centre just hours before her disappearance, which has been shown to the jury during the trial of Mark Bridger for the abduction and murder of the schoolgirl . In a taped police interview played to court she said she was speaking to her mother about going on her bike when Bridger approached. She said: 'Mark drove up and put his window down and started talking to me. 'My friend was there with me and watching him talk to me, he wound down the window and heard what I said to my mum about going on a bike ride. 'He asked me if I could go and have a sleep over with his daughter at his house, his daughter is a friend of mine, she is 10 as well. 'It was odd that he offered me to come for a sleep over, I said: ""Oh that would be great"". 'And he said: ""Well that's sorted then"". 'He didn't say anything else to me and didn't ask what time or day. He drove off the estate and we went on a bike ride.' The girl said she spotted Bridger 10 minutes later lying down in his LandRover with a newspaper over his lap and talking into a walkie-talkie. The girl said: 'He was lying down to his side, not hiding, you could see him. 'He was in the driver's seat and I walked past on the pavement on the other side. 'He didn't say anything but he put his thumbs up to me, he carried on lying down. 'He was speaking into the walkie talkie but I couldn't hear what he was saying. 'He was looking at the newspaper, he wasn't trying to hide the walkie-talkie but it was really odd. 'I smiled at him and rode really fast home - because he was acting really odd.' The jury were taken by coach to visit the white cottage named Mount Pleasant, the former home of defendant Mark Bridger in Ceinws, Mid Wales who is on trial for the abduction and murder of the five-year-old . Floral tributes have been left outside the former home of Mark Bridger in Ceinws, Mid Wales. The defendant claims he does not know what he did with April's body because he was drunk . The schoolgirl told the officers she had never slept over or played at his house. She said it was 'odd' that he asked because she had never stayed at Bridger's daughter's house before. The schoolgirl said she saw April playing on her bike before she vanished. She saw her cycling down a hill with her friend and playing by the garages where she was last seen alive. The 10-year-old - who was sat in a school uniform - wept as she was interviewed by officers. At the beginning of the interview a specialist police officer told her: 'You are not in any trouble at all but we really need your help. 'We are trying to find your friend April Jones. So thank you for helping.' Mold Crown Court also heard from the 10-year-old's mother who heard Bridger in the background while she talked to her daughter on the phone. She said: 'My daughter phoned me from her mobile phone at 5.47pm I asked her where she was and she said she was by the garages with her friend. 'It was during this conversation I heard a man's voice in the background. 'I thought it could be my husband, I asked my daughter: ""Who are you talking to? Is that daddy?"" 'She told me it was Mark Bridger at this point I didn't think any more about this.' The mother told the court how on the evening April vanished children knocked at her door to say she had been kidnapped and could they help search. April, who suffered from cerebral palsy, was playing outside her home in Machynlleth, Powys, when she was allegedly snatched by father-of-six Bridger . Elwen Evans QC, for the prosecution, read the statement of Eleanor Holt, deputy head at Machynlleth Junior School, who saw the defendant at a parents' evening hours before April was allegedly snatched. She said she spoke to Bridger regarding his daughter, who was a pupil at the school. She said: 'I think something gave me the impression that he might have had a couple of drinks due to his manner but I couldn't be sure of this. 'I couldn't smell any alcohol on his breath.' Another teacher, Sian Calben, said she saw Bridger talking to a teenage girl and two younger girls while he was at the parents' evening. She said: 'Mark seemed very chatty and full of himself on Monday - as if he wanted to make his presence felt more than usual.' The court also heard from numerous witnesses who had seen Bridger and his car 'to-ing and fro-ing' around the estate around the time that April disappeared. April was playing outside her home in Machynlleth, Powys, when she was allegedly snatched by father-of-six Bridger. The jury has heard that April's blood was found in Bridger's his cottage in the village of Ceinws, three miles from Machynlleth, with the DNA of a child's skull in ashes taken from the woodburning stove. April's body was never found despite the largest search operation ever staged by British police. The prosecution claims Bridger snatched and murdered the youngster, who had cerebral palsy, in a sexually motivated attack. The defendant claims he knocked her down in his car by accident and cannot remember what he did with her body because he was drunk. Bridger, 47 denies murder, abduction and perverting the course of justice. The trial continues.

Tory donors have threatened to switch their allegiance to UKIP unless David Cameron adopts a tougher stance on Europe. In yet another blow to his leadership, former Tory treasurer Lord Kalms said he was ‘willing to pack my bags’ and sign up with UKIP unless the Prime Minister adopted more traditional Tory policies. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is set to seize on discontent among Tory MPs and UKIP’s recent success in the polls with a fund-raising appeal. Leaving: Senior Torys have said that they are willing to 'pack their bags' and leave for UKIP if the Conservatives don't change their policy . He has been invited by City financier Crispin Odey to pitch to wealthy donors for support. Lord Kalms, the Dixons tycoon, is one of the most likely to start bankrolling UKIP. He said Mr Farage was ‘very, very attractive’ and a ‘first-rate guy,’ adding: ‘UKIP deserve all the support they get.’ He told the Sunday Times: ‘I have always been a Conservative but that loyalty is wearing very, very thin.’ ‘If UKIP has the right policies, that’s where we’ll go. I am very, very disenchanted and won’t tolerate being dragged down into Europe without some fight.’ Defecting: Nigel Farage revealed that at least one Conservative MP has used a go-between to discuss switching to UKIP . He urged the PM to stop trying ‘to be all things to all men - that means you are nothing to nobody’. Lord Kalms was stripped of the Tory whip after he said he would lend his vote to UKIP in 2009. But last year, he donated £5000 to the Conservatives in Harlow, Essex. He and his wife Lady Pamela, have given the Tories £761,287 since 2001. Three of the most generous donors to the Conservatives have reportedly complained about the PM’s emphasis on gay marriage. Support: Nigel Farage has been invited by City financier Crispin Odey to pitch to wealthy donors . Separately, one former Tory donor Andy Brough, has joined UKIP. Backing from more heavyweight donors will be welcomed by UKIP after one of its recent bankrollers, Demetri Marchessini, was criticised for writing a book telling women to stop wearing trousers. A boost in financial support is likely to follow UKIP’s recent success in the local elections, where it won 23 per cent of the vote. It is also on course to come first in the European elections next year. But the rising profile of the party recently led to a bitter confrontation with protesters in Edinburgh which left the party leader shaken. Mr Farage was forced to barricade himself into a pub after angry Scots turned on him, calling him a ‘racist scumbag’. Mr Farage has revealed he has now had to rethink his security situation and hired bodyguards. ‘I have to think about security for the first time ever, I’m afraid. Horrible,’ he said. He added,’ What I’ve done for the last 15 years is to book halls all over the country... and just turn up, park outside, bowl in, do my bit, meet the people afterwards. Sadly that’s going to change.’ A summit to discuss an electoral pact with UKIP is also being planned by the Bow Group - whose president is Sir John Major - and the Conservative Grassroots [corr] body of local parties. The event, Deal or No Deal, is being held in the Commons on June 24. Nadine Dorries, the Conservative MP who was only given back the whip this month after an unauthorised absence from parliament to perform in a reality TV show, reiterated plans for MPs to seek endorsement from UKIP. She told Sky’s Murnaghan: ‘It almost seems a nonsense where you have two people who think and have the same values standing against each other.’ Values: Nadine Dorries reiterated plans for MPs to seek endorsement from UKIP as they have the same values . She added ‘Every Conservative MP has to be adopted by their Conservative association and then they could seek endorsement from UKIP with a double logo. After all, we have just recently voted to change the law to allow that to happen.’ In an interview with the Sunday Times, Mr Farage revealed that UKIP was speaking to ‘about 20’ Tory MPs about standing on a joint ticket. He also cited two Labour MPs - Kate Hoey and Gisela Stewart - who the party would not stand against as they were considered ‘friends’ in the Eurosceptic movement. He is also in talks with Tory councillors who want to defect, while one Tory MP had been in touch with a go-between but Mr Farage had vetoed him after taking one look at his voting record and deciding, ‘no, no way’.","Former treasurer Lord Kalms said he was willing to sign up with UKIP .

"By . Tamara Cohen and Gerri Peev . PUBLISHED: . 03:43 EST, 17 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:36 EST, 17 May 2013 . Fire services across England could be radically reformed to save £200million a year under proposals being considered by ministers. The number of call-outs has nearly halved in ten years to an all-time low, but fire service spending and staffing levels are ‘broadly the same’, a Government-commissioned report found. It said there was room for major ‘efficiencies’, including cutting numbers of full-time fire crews manning stations and replacing them with ‘retained’ staff on call at home – without compromising public safety. Reform: England's fire services could save up to £200million by consolidating, according to a new report . Sir Ken Knight, former chief fire and rescue adviser for England, also recommended merging some of the 46 fire services. He said the traditional 24-hour crew at fire stations ‘had no place in a modern fire service’. But the report has provoked fury from unions, who say the reforms would see services ‘slashed to pieces’. Sir Ken’s report said one fire service could spend twice as much per head as another and achieve the same response times. If all authorities spending above the national average reduced their spending to that level, fire services could save £196million a year, he said. Attendance at emergencies, including home and outdoor fires, car crashes and floods, fell by 40 per cent between 2001/02 and 2011/12. For fires alone, it dropped by 48 per cent. Sir Ken said these reductions were down to the ‘hard work and professionalism’ of firefighters, as well as awareness campaigns and an increase in the use of smoke alarms. With this ‘massive reduction’, he said the service’s role had switched from emergency response to ‘reducing risk’ through awareness campaigns. But he wrote: ‘Despite these changes, no significant change in the make-up or cost of the service has taken place. Fire and rescue authorities now need to transform themselves to reflect the entirely different era of risk and demand they operate in. ‘It is a fact that while most local authorities are feeling the pressure of reduced funding and increased demand for their services, in the case of fire and rescue services there remains a significant decrease in demand.’ Increasing the number of ‘retained’ firefighters – who train one day a week and are called up only in an emergency – from 30 per cent of the service to 40 per cent would save £123million a year, he said. Sir Ken said yesterday: ‘I know firefighters care deeply about public safety and do the best possible job. I’ve seen their capacity to adapt, even in the most trying of circumstances, but my report highlights that there is much more that can be done by the service leaders to make the service as effective and efficient as possible.’ Dave Green, of the Fire Brigades Union, warned that lives could be lost. He said: ‘Response times will increase and the public will be at risk – at greater risk – and the blunt fact is that lives could be lost.’ The Department for Communities and Local Government said it  welcomed the report. Inefficient: Many of the country's 46 fire services have overlapping office functions, it has emerged . Merging? Fire services could join up together to reduce their necessary overheads . A report published today called on fire services to consider collaborating or even merging to save money. Here its author, SIR KEN KNIGHT, reveals how his love of the service compelled him to lay out a radical path for its future. Time for change: Sir Ken Knight has called for radical reform to England's fire services . Our fire service is great at saving lives. But it's not so good at saving money. The conclusion of the review I'm publishing today is that it needs to change. I’ve been privileged to spend more than 40 years working in the fire service, from a raw recruit at 21 to the head of London’s fire brigade. I have personally experienced the highs and lows, and the challenges faced by firefighters from fires, rescues, as well as the satisfaction of saving lives through community safety initiatives. The fire service is in my blood and I have a deep affection and respect for the professionalism, bravery and commitment of all those who serve their communities every day. I believe that nothing should compromise the ability of the fire service to keep people safe in their homes. But sometimes our admiration for those fine men and women blinds us from the reality of the fire service today. I know the service inside and out. And I know times have changed. When I began my career, it was mainly about reaction to emergencies after they had occurred. But today prevention is our calling card. And the effect has been seismic. We’ve seen a 40 per cent drop in call outs and incidents in the last decade. Death caused by fires in the home has dropped to an all time low in my 40 years of service. This is good news, and make no mistake, our fire service is behind this success - educating children, families and older people to take fire safety seriously. But we can’t ignore the difference that modern technology and modern marketing have made too. Smoke alarms, better quality housing and furniture, and fire awareness campaigns are as essential to safety as the traditional hose and ladder to douse the flames. And just as the risks we face have reduced and changed significantly, you would expect our fire fighting organisations to adapt accordingly. But this has not been the case. In writing my review I travelled up and down the country, speaking to those who work in the fire service and probing to find out what was happening on the ground. I found that many fire authorities are spending to their budget but not to their risk. I also unearthed a lack of uniformity in the way they provide services and discovered that the ratio of managers to firefighters varies wildly depending where you are - from 22 fire fighters per senior manager to more than 70. This immediately concerned me, especially when I saw the cost of a service in one area was almost double that of another. Despite the fact there seems to be little correlation between big spending and fire reduction. It’s clear there’s room for savings when fire services have amassed huge capital reserves – increasing from just over £200m to more than £400m between 2008-2012 . In an age of austerity, it’s difficult to comprehend. If the most expensive services could reduce their cost to the same as the national average they would save nearly £200 million of hard-pressed council taxpayers’ money a year. So it’s time for some serious soul searching . Not just for fire chiefs and firefighters but local political leaders too. Can it be right that one service costs so much more than another? Should there really be 46 fire and rescue authorities, each with different governance structures, senior leaders, and organisational and operational quirks? Why do we tolerate the widespread duplication of effort in the design, commissioning and evaluation of fire-specific products? Why aren’t the best ideas from one place implemented in another? Why is waste not being tackled? Like all public services, fire and rescue authorities must evolve and in doing so find new solutions. Local political leaders should encourage their fire chiefs to raise their game share innovation not just with each other but across the blue light services to ensure best practice and sharing resources. My review is a call to action, it is for the Government to consider and for the fire service to respond. And knowing them like I do, I feel completely confident they will, and deliver a quality of service we can all be proud of.","Sir Ken Knight's report claims efficiency gains could save £200million .

An unknown amateur artist's paintings are set to make his family £200,000 because abandoned work by Francis Bacon was found hidden on the back. The celebrated artist used the canvases to paint his famous 'Screaming Pope' series of images on in the 1950s. But Bacon was a ruthless self-critic and trashed his work if he wasn't satisfied with it. He gave some large, discarded canvases to struggling amateur artist Lewis Todd on the strict instructions he had to rip them up before using them. Unseen work by British artist Francis Bacon has been found on the back of an amateur artist's work. Bacon gave Lewis Todd the discarded canvases. It is believed to be worth £200,000 . Valuable: Lesley Todd's work. His family discovered the Bacon artworks on the back of them after Mr Todd died . Mr Todd used the reverse of the canvases to paint his still-life scenes and portraits on at his studio in Cambridge. After he died in 2006, the two-sided paintings were passed down to members of Mr Todd's family, who only then realised parts of Bacon's works were on the back. Bacon's paintings on the reverse are a series of lines and colours, thought to create the background of the 'Screaming Pope' pieces. The ripped-up canvases measure 2ft by 3ft each and without Bacon's work would be worth hardly anything. But auctioneers selling the six double-sided paintings have put a pre-sale estimate of £100,000 on them, but wouldn't be surprised if they fetch twice that amount. Chris Ewbank, of Ewbank Auctions in Guildford, Surrey, said: 'Bacon donated his pieces to a struggling artist, Lewis Todd. Amateur artist Lewis Todd was given the canvas by Bacon, under the instruction that he must cut them up . 'Bacon had a thing about his work that he wasn't happy with it falling into the wrong hands and going into the public domain and market, so if he didn't like it he would destroy it. 'He preferred to paint on the back of a canvas, so he thought these discarded piecescould be used by another artist, but only if he cut them up before using them. Genius: Artist Francis Bacon photographed in front of some his work at Claude Bernard Gallery, Paris, in 1977 . 'The images are from a series of Screaming Pope paintings before Bacon was very famous and without his work on the back, they would be worth almost nothing. 'If it was a completed Bacon piece they would be worth much more. One of the Screaming Pope series sold last November for £18.7million. 'Bacon was painting popes at that time and it was all to do with the Second World War, I think he thought the Pope had been ineffective so it was a bit of a rebellion.' Mr Ewbank says he doesn't know how many of these discarded Bacon canvases are in existence but hopes that people who have a Lewis Todd painting will look on the back to see if they have a Bacon piece. He added: 'People haven't necessarily got the money to buy proper Bacon paintings, so this is an opportunity to buy something from the hand of the artist. Two of the oil paintings are expected to fetch £30,000 each. One shows the leg of a chair on the reverse and the other shows the arm of a pope. Three pieces are expected to sell for £20,000. One which shows a set of curtain rings on a black background, another the yellow and white edge of a chair and the third a series of vertical black stripes. The final canvas, which has not been looked at by the the Authentication Committee of Francis Bacon, is expected to reach £10,000.

Ed Miliband has been attacked for lacking a ‘credible’ economic message and leading a ‘policy-light’ party by Labour’s biggest donor has said. John Mills, the chairman of shopping giant JML, warned that the Labour leader does not have a ‘clear idea on how to get the economy growing again at a reasonable speed and how to get the deficit down to a much more sustainable proportion’. The scathing assessment came as a . poll showed the public view the Labour leader as as less competent and . trustworthy than Gordon Brown. Weak: Gordon Brown was seen as stronger in the days after his election defeat than Ed Miliband is now, according to a damning new opinion poll . The millionaire, who made the remarks to LondonlovesBusiness.com website, has given Labour £1.65 million in shares this year. He is the only substantial business person to back Labour under Mr Miliband, with most of Labour’s funds still coming from trade unions. ‘The whole political spectrum is policy-light and this includes the Labour Party,’ Mr Mills said. ‘I’m not sure anybody has a compelling message.’ Asked why Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor had not communicated a strategy, he said: ‘That’s a very good question but patently this hasn’t happened’. Mr Mills is also the chairman of Britain for Business, a campaign group which is demanding that the UK renegotiates its relationship with the European Union. He said of Mr Miliband’s refusal to promise a referendum was ‘not a vote-winner on the doorstep and the Labour leadership has to weigh this up’. His praise for Mr Miliband was limited to him being a ‘very nice person’ and a ‘very capable speaker’, but the tycoon added that anybody in opposition ‘always looks like a pygmy’. A damning new survey shows voters think Mr Miliband is weaker and more dithering than Gordon Brown. Pressure: Mr Miliband has seen his poll lead eroded amid speculation fears an upturn in the economy could write-off his election hopes . Leadership: The YouGov poll found voters thought Mr Miliband was less 'in touch' and more 'dithering' than Mr Brown . Strength: More people thought Mr Brown was trustworthy and more thought Mr Milband was weak . Voters also believe Mr Miliband is less decisive than his predecessor – despite the criticism of Mr Brown that all he did in office was launch countless policy reviews. After two and a half years in the job, the YouGov poll for the Times showed that more than 50 per cent of the public regard him as out of touch, dithering, weak or unclear about what he stands for. Fewer than one in five believe he is decisive or strong. The characteristic most often associated with Mr Miliband was that he dithered. More people regard him as incompetent – 42 – to competent – 28. And even more view him as untrustworthy – 40 per cent – compared to trustworthy – 29 per cent. However, the public did regard Mr Miliband as honest, with 39 per cent believing he was truthful compared to 24 per cent who did not. Compared to Mr Brown after polling day in May 2010, Mr Miliband was seen as being more on the side of a select few (34 per cent to 38 per cent) and more dithering (57 to 56). However Mr Miliband was regarded as a better leader of the Labour party than Mr Brown by 32 per cent of voters, while 17 per cent he was worse and 41 per cent he was no better or worse. A separate poll to monitor the public’s perception of Boris Johnson found that the London Mayor’s colourful private life had made no impact on his popularity. Asked by ComRes whether the revelation that Mr Johnson had cheated on his wife and fathered a child with his mistress would make it less likely for them to vote for him in a general election, 76 per cent disagreed and just 15 per cent agreed. UKIP supporters were the most relaxed about Mr Johnson’s philandering, with just ten per cent saying they were less likely to vote for him because of it.","Poll reveals voters trust current leader less than his predecessor .

Civil servants are getting paid an extra £1,000 a year simply for being able to type, it emerged last night. The award is one of a string of perks worth £7.5million available annually at the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) and related quangos. Others include officials at the Local Government Ombudsman who are paid up to an additional £684 for working from home. Civil servants can receive more than £1,000 for 'proficient typing' under a raft of extra Whitehall allowances . Perks such as a 'disturbance grant' of £2,325 for staff working away from home on special projects were revealed in a Parliamentary answer to Conservative MP Priti Patel. Mrs Patel said: 'In this day and age, civil servants should not be getting bonuses in addition to their pay just for doing their job. 'Now is a good time ahead of the comprehensive spending review to say that we have got to be spending our money more wisely.' Staff at the DCLG who become fire marshals are paid an extra £144, while those who learn first aid get an additional £200. An extra £3,160 is paid to staff if they agree to be on-call and field calls after 'normal' working hours – an expected and unrewarded part of most private sector jobs. One quango, the Homes and Communities Agency, hands a bonus of 10 per cent of annual salary to staff who undertake additional duties 'for a significant time in addition to their normal duties'. A first aider can receive an extra £200 (file picture) IT staff also get an extra 10 per cent for being called out during 'unsocial hours'. At the Housing Ombudsman all staff get £427 extra a year as a personal development allowance. Meanwhile, the Planning Inspectorate has spent more than £1million since 2011 on allowances and subsidies, including up to £4,000 per staff member to 'retain' officials. An array of bonuses are paid for inspectors – including £3,056  for officials who undertake 'specialist right of way work', normally  carried out by bureaucrats at a higher grade. Technicians at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, opposite the Houses of Parliament, receive up to £6,500 a year if they have to liaise with clients. Car allowances worth a total £61,398 were handed out to staff at the West Northamptonshire Development Corporation. Simply not bringing a car to work will reap employees an extra £600. Some staff at the DCLG with IT qualifications get £3,000 while those hired as accountants are paid an additional £3,000. Discretionary allowances of up to £4,000 are also awarded to 'experts' such as economists, scientists, statisticians, social researchers, geographers and engineers. The soon to be scrapped Audit Commission shelled out £1.7million in perks and allowances in the last financial year. A three-year allowance for 'excess fares' was also offered to staff asked to relocate. And more than £20,000 was paid out to officials for what most workers would regard as normal commuting costs. Most of the perks are paid to long-serving staff still employed under older, generous contracts. In Whitehall departments London-based staff are even allowed to work one hour less a day because it can take them longer to get home. On top of generous holiday and sick pay terms, staff are also given an extra two-and-a-half 'privilege' days off every year. A spokesman said the DCLG has halved staffing costs since the Coalition came to power. He said: 'Only a very small number of people receive these allowances, most of which do not have origins in the Department for Communities and Local Government. The department had to honour existing terms and conditions for staff that transferred over from arms-length bodies that were closed down as part of the Government's restructuring. They are not available to anyone else. 'Some also address specific recruitment and retention issues around business critical posts that require professional skills. 'The department is in the process of reviewing its pay policies, including allowances and subsidies, as part of wider civil service reform and ensuring good value for public money.' As part of a Whitehall clampdown on pay and perks Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude has asked managers to identify employment conditions 'that are beyond what a modern employer would provide'.","Award is one of a string of perks available annually at the DCLG .

EU lawmakers have changed their minds about plans to ban restaurants from serving olive oil in glass jugs . The European Commission has bottled it over plans to ban restaurants from serving olive oil in glass jugs or dipping bowls. Bureaucrats had originally argued that diners were at risk of being served 'inferior' or diluted oil, which could also harbour germs if served in an open dish or bottle. Officials had wanted to force restaurateurs to only serve oil in its original bottles, with tamper-proof lids from January 1 next year. David Cameron criticised the ban, saying it was 'exactly the sort of area that the European Union needs to get right out of'. Other politicians also pressed Brussels to drop the dippy rule. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: 'This olive oil ban was virgin on the ridiculous.' A u-turn was finally extracted from the Commissioner who first proposed the plan, Dacian Cioloş. At a press conference in Brussels, he said: 'I've decided to withdraw this proposal and not submit it for adoption. I wanted to come here today to demonstrate that I've been very alive to the current debate in the press.' However the European Commission has plans to revive the topic of how to promote quality olive oil without excessive meddling at a meeting next week in Brussels with hotels, restaurants and consumers .

An ageing population has pushed the NHS and social care system to the brink of collapse, the health minister Norman Lamb has warned. Extra pressure piled onto A&E departments and other parts of the NHS was making the system ‘dysfunctional’. More action had to be taken to get elderly people out of hospitals to recover at home, said Mr Lamb who is in charge of care services. Basic adaptations are not being carried out on elderly people’s homes, stopping them from leaving hospital. A failure to organise home help was also impeding their rehabilitation in the community. Ministers will today unveil plans to improve co-ordination between NHS services and councils to make it easier for the elderly to leave hospital. Mr Lamb said the ageing population and the strain on the NHS was ‘the challenge of the 21st century’ He told The Daily Telegraph: ‘A&E units are under pressure, ambulances are carrying more patients than they should, signiﬁcant numbers of people are in hospital who should be cared for elsewhere. ‘The system is becoming dysfunctional and we need to do something about it.’ A review into the funding system has been announced and Mr Lamb said: ‘The hospital gets paid for a patient arriving in hospital but there is no incentive for them to leave.’ Ministers are to demand better co-ordination between the NHS and social services . Ministers want to overhaul the payments to reward improvements in patients’ conditions. Mr Lamb said: ‘The system will collapse in the long term if we do not take decisive action now.’ The system was ‘horribly fragmented’ leading to ‘bad care — distress, crises occurring that could be avoided, massive disruption to people’s lives. If we carry on as we are the system will collapse’. Ministers are to demand better co-ordination between the NHS and social services. One idea is for elderly patients to be assigned their own NHS worker to oversee their transition from hospital to home.","Adaptions needed for elderly people's homes so they can leave hospital .

'Lacking clarity: Ed Miliband stands on a pallet as he speaks to members of the public in Hastings, East Sussex, after the local elections this month . Ed Miliband’s leadership of the Labour Party was under renewed scrutiny last night as its lead  over the Conservatives fell to just three points. Support for the Opposition has slumped to 34 per cent, down four points from a month ago, and its lowest level since the 2010 general  election, according to the latest poll from Ipsos Mori. The Conservatives were up two points, despite internal turmoil over the EU referendum, poor local election results and the fact the Government is in mid-term. Strategists are blaming Labour’s own lack of clarity on Europe and disillusionment with the leadership of Mr Miliband for the poor performance in the polls and this month’s local elections. The poll put the Conservatives on 31 per cent while UKIP were at 13 per cent – ahead of the Lib Dems, who remained unchanged on ten per cent. However the survey is of those who say they are certain to vote – and Labour supporters are less likely to say they will definitely turn up at the ballot box. But it does underscore how soft Labour’s lead is. Privately, Labour insiders are warning of a ‘crisis of legitimacy’ if the party only secures a 34 per cent share of the vote at the next  general election. While it would still give the party a parliamentary majority of around 30 seats, it would be the lowest winning percentage of the vote since the Whigs won in 1832. Mr Miliband’s personal approval ratings were unchanged from last month, with 35 per cent satisfied and 49 per cent dissatisfied. Senior party figures including Lord Mandelson have warned that the unions have further entrenched their grip on Labour, dictating  candidate selections for the 2015 general election. Alistair Darling, the former Chancellor, has also said voters needed clarity on Mr Miliband’s ‘direction of travel’, adding that the party also had to reveal its economic plans if it wanted to win voters’ trust. Tony Blair has also taken a swipe at Mr Miliband’s leadership, warning last month Labour was in danger of becoming party of protest. He said the party had to resist temptation to ‘settle back into its old territory of defending the status quo’. 'Settling back into old territory': Lord Mandelson, left, and former prime minister Tony Blair, right, are among the senior Labour figures who have spoken out against Mr Miliband's leadership of the party in recent months . How would you vote if there were a General Election tomorrow? The the results of that question over a decade, highlighting major political events. Red is Labour; blue, Conservatives; yellow, Lib Dems; and purple, UKIP . Alan Milburn, the former health secretary, added his support to Mr Blair, saying: ‘The closer the election comes, people will stop asking Labour what it is against. The answers to that question given most recently to polling organisation Ipsos MORI . 'They will want to know what Labour is for and what, if elected, it would do.’ Mr Miliband’s refusal to back welfare reforms has also proved unpopular. Taunting him recently at Prime Minister’s Questions David Cameron said Labour should change its name to the ‘Welfare Party’. Under Mr Miliband’s leadership, support from business leaders has slipped away and the party has become increasingly reliant on funding from trade unions. According to the latest donation figures from the Electoral Commission, unions are still providing three pounds out of four to the party. Grant Shapps, chairman of the Conservative Party, said: ‘Until Ed Miliband breaks his overwhelming reliance on the union barons’ coffers, he cannot stand up for Britain’s hardworking people. 'Instead he can only offer the same old Labour plan of more spending, more borrowing and more debt.’","Support for the Opposition at 34 per cent, down four points in a month .

The war in Afghanistan will cost every British household £2,000, a foreign policy adviser to the Government said yesterday. But Frank Ledwidge added that not a single Al Qaeda terrorist who posed a threat to Britain has been killed by Nato forces in Helmand. And the province is no more stable now than when British troops were deployed there in 2006. Cost: By 2020 the bill for Britain for the Afghan campaign will reach £40billion, according to analyst Frank Ledwidge . Latest Ministry of Defence figures show 444 British soldiers have been killed since the start of the Afghan conflict in 2001. British troops are due to withdraw next year, but caring for wounded soldiers means the costs will reach £40billion by 2020. That is enough to pay 5,000 nurses or . police officers for their entire career, or fund free university tuition . for all higher education students for a decade. The ‘conservative’ calculations were . made by Mr Ledwidge who has been a civilian adviser to the British . government in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan. In his book Investment in . Blood, he claims that since 2006 it has cost taxpayers at least . £15million a day to keep troops in Helmand. He said: ‘Of all the thousands of . civilians and combatants, not a single Al Qaeda operative or . international terrorist who could conceivably have threatened the United . Kingdom is recorded as having been killed by Nato forces in Helmand.’ The only ones to benefit from the war have been foreign aid consultants, Afghan drug lords and arms companies, he said. He added that much British aid to Afghanistan was spent on consultancy fees rather than on those Afghans who need it most. Lessons: Mr Ledwidge said that Britain needed to think again before entering another major conflict and ask: 'Will it be worth the cost?' Mr Ledwidge argued that Al Qaeda . should have been dealt with by the security services rather than being . treated like a military problem. The real reason Britain had spent so . much in human and financial costs in Afghanistan was ‘the perceived . necessity of retaining the closest possible links with the US’. He told the Guardian: ‘Once the last . British helicopter leaves a deserted and wrecked Camp Bastion, Helmand – . to which Britain claimed it would bring ‘‘good governance’’ – will be a . fractious narco-state occasionally fought over by opium barons and . their cronies.’ Cuts: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has warned deep cuts in his budget would affect the UK's military capabilities . He added: ‘There are no new lessons here, only one . rather important old precept: before you engage in a war, understand the . environment you are going into, precisely and realistically what it is . you are trying to achieve and will it be worth the cost? In other words . have a strategy.’ Bills for the war in Afghanistan will . keep climbing even once troops have pulled out as more than 2,600 . British troops have been wounded in the conflict and more than 5,000 . have been ‘psychologically injured’. Mr Ledwidge added: ‘There is no doubt that the continuing costs of taking care of the wounded will far exceed £1billion.’ Around £25billion has been spent from the Treasury’s special reserve for military operations alone. The Ministry of Defence is under . pressure, like all Whitehall departments, to slash its budget as . Chancellor George Osborne is demanding further efficiency savings. But Phil Hammond, the Defence Secretary, has made it clear he will resist cuts to operations. He said: ‘There is a difference . between efficiency savings, which may be difficult to achieve but are . painless in terms of the impact on the front line, and output cuts, . which are of a very different order and require proper and mature . consideration across government about the impact that they will have on . our military capabilities.’","By 2020 total bill will reach £40billion, according to a new book .

Scotland could end up ‘like Panama’ if it gains independence but keeps the pound, George Osborne has warned. The Chancellor said it was ‘unlikely’ the rest of the UK would want to enter a currency union with a separate Scotland. A devastating 118-page Treasury paper sets out the economic realities of independence. Scroll down for video . Damning: George Osborne, pictured in Glasgow yesterday, said he could veto any plan to share the pound with an independent Scotland as the deal could be risky, which would be a huge blow to Alex Salmond should he win the 2014 referendum . Scottish banknotes would disappear if voters back independence and opts to continue using the UK pound, the Treasury warned . The country could use sterling with . Westminster’s permission, Mr Osborne said, but would not have any say . over the Bank of England or macro-economic policy, which influences . currency. ‘We can say no to a currency zone, a . euro-style arrangement between two foreign governments,’ he told BBC . Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘Scotland could go on using the pound . rather like Panama uses the American dollar, but it would have . absolutely no control at all over its currency or its macro-economic . framework.’ Countries do use foreign currencies without consent, he said, ‘but it’s a very, very difficult option’. Mr Osborne launched the Scotland Analysis paper on Currency and Monetary Policy, in the Glasgow Trades Hall . Mr Osborne and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, ruled out a euro-style currency zone in which Scotland could opt-in to using the pound . The reference to Panama raises the . spectre of a scandal in the 1690s, when Scotland tried to colonise part . of the country, resulting in thousands of deaths. Seven years later, a . bankrupt Scotland agreed to the Act of Union. Mr Osborne also warned that England, . Wales and Northern  Ireland would not tie themselves ‘to the economic . policies of what would have become a foreign government’ or to an . economy ‘very dependent’ on oil and finance. Mr Osborne said in Glasgow: ‘Why would . 58million citizens give away some of their sovereignty over monetary . and potentially other economic policy to five million people in another . state? ‘Let’s be clear – abandoning  current arrangements would  represent a very deep dive indeed in to uncharted waters.’ Backing: Former Chancellor, Labour's Alistair Darling, says that Osborne is right and that the SNP cannot promise to keep the pound . Should Scotland become independent in . the 2014 referendum, and want to use the pound, it would have to submit . economic plans to the UK before its administration in Holyrood, he said. He went on: ‘The conclusion is clear – . the pound we share works well. The saying goes, “If it ain’t broke, why . fix it?”, but I say, “If it ain’t broke, don’t break it”.’ Scottish First Minister Alex  Salmond . accused Westminster of ‘sabre-rattling’. He said: ‘This is a Tory . Chancellor trying to scare people in Scotland, trying to stop them . voting for independence. ‘But the day after a resounding “yes” vote in the referendum . . . he will sing an entirely different tune. It’s in everyone’s interests to have a currency area after . independence.’ The Treasury gave four options facing . an independent Scotland: forming a UK currency union; joining Sterling . with no control over policy; joining the euro; or a separate Scottish . currency. Mr Osborne also warned that Scotland could have to take on large amounts of national debt. But Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney claimed ‘the UK as the successor state is obliged to hold on to all of the debt’.

Because it finally allowed her 252ft,  20-year labour of love to bloom – in the most magnificent way. For 14 years, the amateur gardener carefully trained this wisteria to grow along the full length of her wall. Then, for another six years, she waited. Each spring it tried to bloom, and each spring the flowers were killed off by frost. Impressive: For 15 years Judith Wilson, 56, lovingly trained the vine to grow along the full length of her giant garden wall near Witham in Essex . Before: Despite having no gardening training, in 1993 she embarked on the task of trying to get the wisteria to spread across the wall (pictured in 1988) Different scene: When Mrs Wilson and her husband moved into their home, Wickham Place Farm, the only thing growing on the wall was ivy . Until this year, when the delayed . spring meant that, for the first time, the whole bush bloomed into a . 13ft-high waterfall of mauve. Mrs Wilson, 56, started tending the . wisteria in 1993, to replace the ivy that she and her husband had found . growing on the wall when they moved into Wickham Place Farm near Witham, . Essex. ‘There was a very neglected wisteria . growing on the other side of the wall,’ she said. ‘I began pruning it . and training it to grow on this side of the wall. ‘I didn’t know what I was doing, I just read from books what to do. ‘Year on year it got bigger and . bigger. It grew ten feet a year in each direction before reaching both . ends of the wall six years ago. Outstanding: Thanks to the late spring the mauve-coloured Chinese wisteria senensis is covered in flowers across its full length and 13ft height . Big job: Mrs Wilson spends two whole weeks a year pruning the bush in February and July and replacing 1,000 ties that keep it attached to a wire structure on the wall . Happy: Mrs Wilson, who has four other wisterias, including one which is 100ft long, is a member of the National Garden Scheme and opens her garden to visitors . ‘It’s been filling out ever since but . the flowers keep being killed off by the spring frosts. Last year only . about 10 per cent of the flowers bloomed.’ Mrs Wilson spends two weeks a year . pruning the plant, thought to be one of the longest wisteria in Britain, . and replacing the 1,000 ties which keep it attached to the wall. She opens her gardens to the public every Friday to raise money for the local hospice. Mrs Wilson hopes her beloved plant will stay in bloom for at least another fortnight, as long as the weather stays cool. She said: ‘When I walk along and see . it, it brings a lump to my throat and I stand there with tears in my . eyes. It is so fantastic.’","For 15 years Judith Wilson, 56, lovingly trained vine to grow along full length of her giant garden wall .

With the economy on the critical list, you might expect a Tory business minister to be toiling day and night on plans for the recovery. But such important matters can be put on hold, it seems, when a baby comes along. Tory MP Matthew Hancock has decided to take a two-month break this summer after his third child is born. Third child: Tory MP Matthew Hancock, right, will take a two-month break this summer after his wife Martha gives birth to the couple's third child . The minister is behind moves to extend parental leave to fathers as well as mothers and make it interchangeable – a plan criticised by business leaders, who say it will create a huge financial burden for small firms and will discourage businesses from taking on staff. Mr Hancock told the Daily Mail he was a supporter of the changes, which will come into force in 2015, and added: ‘I am taking paternity leave myself. It’s important to form a strong bond with your children.’ He will take the two weeks paternity leave that all new fathers are entitled to, but will add the MPs’ extended summer recess on to the end, meaning he will take around two months leave. Business sense: Plans to extend paternity leave have been criticised by business leaders, who say it will create a huge financial burden for small firms (file picture) Last night Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘While everybody would want to wish Mr Hancock and his family well as he becomes a father for the third time, it will rankle that he is granting himself a perk which is not currently available to anyone else. ‘There’s little that angers taxpayers more than when politicians live by one set of rules as they impose another set on the rest of us.’ Mr Hancock, 34, admitted his break was only really possible because of the ‘peculiarities of life as an MP’. He added: ‘I will be in the country and contactable. As a minister, you are always on duty if things crop up.’ The MP lives in Notting Hill, West London, in a road where similar homes go for up to £2million. He has a daughter, six, and a five-year-old son with his wife Martha, 36, who works part-time as an osteopath. Her grandfather, the 1st Baron Inchyra, was British ambassador to West Germany, and her great grandfather was the 1st Viscount Camrose. Mr Hancock, a former adviser to George Osborne, has been tipped for high office – not least by himself. As a backbench MP, he compared himself to former Tory prime ministers Churchill, Disraeli and Pitt. In office, he rejected his official departmental photo as ‘too dreary’ and asked for a more statesmanlike one from his website to be used. Mr Hancock also raised eyebrows by missing a breakfast TV interview after sleeping in – he had been due to discuss the Government’s criticism of ‘shirkers’ claiming benefits. The West Suffolk MP, the son of a businessman, was privately educated at The King’s School in Chester and gained a degree in politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford and a masters in economics from Cambridge. Asked how Business Secretary Vince Cable felt about his impending absence, Mr Hancock said: ‘Do you know what? I haven’t asked him.’ Tory sources pointed out that technically he has to seek leave of absence from Tory whips, while the Department for Business said: ‘It will very much be business as usual, he will be on the ministerial duty rota.’ Family man: Mr Hancock said he had not asked Business Secretary Vince Cable about his impending absence, but a source close to the Liberal democrat said he would be 'supportive' A source close to Lib Dem Mr Cable said: ‘As a family man, Vince would be supportive of Matthew juggling his responsibilities as a minister and father. We want to encourage fathers to share childcare and that means them playing a more active role. ‘Matthew is entitled to take paternity leave and his child is due to be born just before the summer recess. He works very, very hard throughout the year.’ A friend of Mr Hancock said: ‘He has hardly had a day off since he started and is taking leave by saving up his holiday. He will still be on duty, as well as being on hand to look after the baby. The normal criticism of Matt is that he’s a workaholic, it would be outrageous to paint him as lazy.’","Matthew Hancock will take a two-month break after third child born .

Under a fierce spring sun in the Cyprus capital of Nicosia, Maria Ioannou, a British mother of two, queued outside a bank yesterday to discover if she still had a Euro to her name. The 35-year-old accountant from North London soon learned the devastating truth. She, and her husband, Michael, have lost their savings of £135,000 (160,000 euros) because of the banking crisis on the Mediterranean island. ‘Our dreams of building a house here in Cyprus, giving a good life in the sunshine to our two young children, have been shattered,’ said Mrs Ioannou, near to tears, after an hour’s appointment with the manager of the Cyprus Popular Bank, known locally as Laiki. ‘When he showed me details of our deposits, they had been stamped with the words: ‘Account blocked’. Scroll down for video . Maria Ioannou, a British mother of two has lost thousands in the Cyprus banking crisis. Pictured, an elderly woman looks at a savings book as people wait in line at a bank in Nicosia, Cyprus yesterday . Mrs Ioannou had waited her turn outside Laiki in the smart suburb of Pallouriotissa alongside a long line of Cypriots, a handful of Britons, and a young African. When the promised bank opening at midday was delayed by half an hour because of a computer glitch, shouts rang out among the increasingly angry people as they pushed towards the doors, guarded by policemen drafted in to stop violence and protect staff. On Wednesday night, five shipping containers filled with billions of Euros are reported to have been flown to Cyprus from Frankfurt and delivered to the island’s central bank to ensure money did not run out. A helicopter and police cars guarded the armoured cash convoy, thought to have been sent by the European Central Bank, on its way from the airport. Strict new rules have been imposed to stop a run on Cyprus banks which yesterday opened for the first time since the island’s economic meltdown started nearly a fortnight ago. A woman gestures as she waits outside a Laiki bank branch in Nicosia. Mrs Ioannou (not pictured) and her husband have lost £135,000 . Airports have are now searching passengers and stopping anyone trying to leave the country with more than 1000 euros (£845) and daily cash machine withdrawals are limited to 300 euros (£250). The clampdown, agreed by the Eurozone finance chiefs in exchange for a 10billion euro bailout (£8.5 billion) to the island has hit Mrs Ioannou and other depositors at two banks, Laiki and the troubled Cyprus Bank, at the heart of the crisis. Depositors with both banks can keep 100,000 euros (£84,000) but will lose all deposits above this amount to finance the island’s contribution to the rescue deal. It is the first time that a bailout condition to a Eurozone country has included the raiding of depositors’ accounts, a decision that has infuriated the islanders. Mrs Ioannou put more than 200,000 Eeros (£168,000) in the Laiki bank after selling her house in north London and de-camping to Cyprus a little over a year ago with her husband, and their two children, a son aged four, and daughter of one. She has now lost half of this money. Michael, a research scientist gave up a plum post at an English university and also put 160,000 Euros (£135,000) of his savings in the same bank. He learned yesterday that he will lose 60,000 Euros (£51,000) of the money. ‘We have not been able to sleep at night with the worry’ said Mrs Ioannou outside the bank yesterday. ‘I nod off for ten minutes, then wake up in terror at what has happened to us. My husband is devastated. 'The funds we deposited included money given to us as a wedding present by our family and friends. ‘We have bought a plot of land in Nicosia and have paid for architects to design a house with a garden, which is a rarity in the capital. Now we do not have the money to build the house. 'We will have to stay in our rented three bedroom flat. I wish I had never sold my terraced house in London, which will have gone up in price since. ‘Michael went to Laiki two months ago because was worried about rumours that the bank was in trouble. He said he wanted to withdraw the money he had brought to Cyprus from Britain and send it back to the UK, where he still has an account with a High Street bank. A security guard, right, stands in front of a bank. There were angry scenes at banks across the island yesterday . ‘The Laiki official sat him down and told him not to worry. The official said he had money deposited in the bank too and nothing was at risk. He persuaded Michael to keep the money there. ‘We have worked hard. We have saved our money and not taken risks. Now we will have to start all over again. My parents who live in London and were refugees to Britain after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 say this is a ‘Second War’ that those living here are facing.’ Like many Cypriots and Britons, Maria says she was attracted to the Laiki bank by a deposit account which offered something called a ‘monthly step up plan’. This allowed her to withdraw money each month to pay for architect’s costs and other outgoings as she planned the new house. It also offered an enticing interest rate of between 3 and 5 per cent - far higher than the current ones offered in the UK. Rage: Thousands of Cypriots protested against the harsh treatment imposed on Cyprus. The new agreement will see massive savings raids on those who have more than 100,000 Euros deposited in banks . ‘The bank was still advertising this “step up plan” on the Friday two weeks ago that the banks closed at 1.30 and the crisis began,’ she says with fury. In a further cruel twist, Maria was told yesterday that a 200,000 euro loan she and Michael, who was born in Cyprus, have taken out at the bank to help build their house will still have to be repaid. ‘So we cannot use some of our “confiscated” funds to pay that off,' she said. No, the bank has taken that and we will end up paying for a loan for years for a house that we cannot afford to build.’ She is just one of hundreds of Britons caught up in the Cyprus banking crisis that is threatening financial stability across the world. Those who have settled on the island last night spoke of their fears that they will not be able to sell their houses (which had already slumped dramatically in price before the current crisis began) without making a significant loss. Many believe that they couldn’t now get their money out of the country even if they could get rid of their properties. 'Our dreams of building a house here in Cyprus, giving a good life in the sunshine to our two young children, have been shattered,' said Mrs Ioannou . Terry Rose, a 67-year-old retired Army warrant officer, moved to Cyprus five years ago from Leeds in Yorkshire with his wife Hazel. They bought a newly-built home in the picturesque village of Pyrgos, perched on a hillside above Limassol where 40 per cent of the inhabitants are British. ‘If I sold the house now it would be at a loss. But how would we move the money out of Cyprus back to the UK anyway?’ he asked. ‘We are stuck here. I like Cyprus, but the choice of where we spend our retirement years has been taken away from us, just like that.’ The Roses have an 100,000 euro investment bond lodged with the island’s Alpha bank which has so far avoided the worst of the troubles. They had put it in the bank to pay for unexpected medical bills as they grew older. However, after the banking crisis blew up two weeks ago they began to worry that their money was not safe. Like all the others, the bank shut its doors. Staff did not return Terry’s emails or calls. 'We have worked hard. We have saved . our money and not taken risks. Now we will have to start all over again. My parents who live in London and were refugees to Britain after the . Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 say this is a ‘Second War’ that those . living here are facing.' He explained: ‘Lots of English people are frightened now and want to sell up. Many are retired people like us. 'At our time of life we should be enjoying ourselves. Instead we are worried sick that we are trapped here.’ Yesterday David Rumsey, of 3D Global financial advisors in Cyprus, warned that it is responsible people who carefully invested savings in the island’s banks who are now being hit by the controversial bailout plan. ‘It is ordinary people, both Britons and Cypriots, who are paying the price.' Certainly those in the bank queue, including Mrs Ioannou, seemed to prove his point. Stavros Shaelis a 61-year-old Cypriot businessman runs a small company importing plastics to the island. He had hoped to get permission to pay his suppliers through his Laiki account. Cash flow: The ban shut-down hammered businesses, which have been without access to their funds for two weeks . ‘I have not been caught by the 100,000 Euro confiscation, but I have not been able to do business for a fortnight because the banks have been shut. It has been difficult.’ And Ibrahim Bunduka, a 22-year-old Sierra Leone football professional playing for a Cypriot club was also waiting patiently. ‘I have 30,000 Euros in my account here,’ he said. ‘I want to get it out and send it to a bank in the UK. I am afraid of losing my savings after what has happened. ‘For months now the club has not been paying my salary on time. I feared the island had financial problems. I want to move to London this summer when my contract is over and take my money with me.’ When and how he will ever be able to do so remains to be seen.","Maria Ioannou's family has lost the staggering sum as a result of EU bailout .

Overstretched hospitals had to close their A&E departments to ambulances hundreds of times last year as the crisis in the NHS deepens. Ambulances were turned away and sent to other hospitals no fewer than 357 times in 2012/13 - up almost a quarter on the previous year. The alarming figures, uncovered by Labour, show that on average over the past year, one casualty department had to close its doors every single day. Diversions: Ambulances were turned away and sent to other hospitals no fewer than 357 times in 2012/13 - up almost a quarter on the previous year . Concerns: Extra delays can increase the risk that patients inside could deteriorate before medical help is received . Extra delays can increase the risk that patients inside could deteriorate before medical help is received. The most recent example was on Bank Holiday Monday, when the Royal Liverpool Hospital had to divert patients to Fazakerley Hospital and Whiston Hospital for periods during both the morning and afternoon. Even when it reopened, ambulances had to queue and patients faced long delays. The figures come amid growing concerns over emergency and out-of-hours care. Last week the Daily Mail revealed that 50 beds a week have closed in NHS hospitals since the election - piling extra pressure on A&E departments. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last week blamed GPs for the overcrowding in England’s casualty wards - saying it was too hard to get an appointment to see them, meaning many have no choice but to turn up at A&E. In addition, more than nine in 10 GPs opted out of responsibility for their patients out of hours in 2004 despite taking advantage of a huge pay rise as part of a botched contract. Finger pointing: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last week blamed GPs for the overcrowding in England's casualty wards . Replacement out of hours services proved inadequate in many areas - meaning patients have to go to casualty. Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, demanded a moratorium on the closure of casualty units across the country in light of the latest alarming figures. ‘A&Es across the country are in crisis and the pressure shows no sign of abating,’ he said. ‘Today we have yet more evidence that the situation has deteriorated significantly on this Government’s watch, with ambulance diverts up by a quarter in the last year. ‘This is a crisis of their own making. Instead of casting round for others to blame, David Cameron and Jeremy Hunt need to accept responsibility and develop an urgent plan to relieve the pressure.’ Labour obtained the figures on A&E ‘diverts’ from the House of Commons Library. These diverts are where a department has to temporarily close because they lack the physical space or staff capacity to deal with any additional patients. In 2011/12 there were 287 such occasions when hospitals reached capacity and were unable to cope with new ambulances. A year later this had risen by 24 per cent to 357. Over recent weeks, hospitals in London have been forced to turn ambulances away. They include Queens, Newham and King George’s hospitals in east London, Whipps Cross and Northwick Park hospitals in north London, and the Princess Royal and Lewisham hospitals in south London. The diversions occurred either when the ambulance was on the journey to hospital or in some cases after they have arrived. This wastes time for patients with emergency conditions before they can receive emergency care. Now Liverpool has been added to the list. Full: Queens Hospital in London is one of several hospitals in the capital to turn ambulances away from its A&E in recent weeks . No go: Northwick Park Hospital, pictured, is another that has had to divert emergency patients to another A&E . John Heyworth, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, the body which represents A&E doctors, said: ‘The emergency department is the point in the system where the pressures of ever increasing demand and finite hospital capacity collide. ‘This leads to crowding in emergency departments and ambulance diversions. This is frustrating for our patients and difficult for clinicians to provide the prompt high quality care our patients expect and deserve. Concerns: Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham, pictured, called on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to suspend all ongoing A&E closure proposals . ‘Urgent action is both required and overdue to provide an emergency care system responsive to our patients’ needs.’ Labour is today holding an ‘emergency A&E summit’ to hear directly from staff about the pressures they face on a day-to-day basis. Mr Burnham called on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to suspend all ongoing A&E closure proposals pending a personal review of the latest evdience. ‘The facts on the ground are changing fast and call into question the wisdom and safety of closing so many A&Es across England,’ he said. ‘If convincing evidence can be produced to show lives can be saved by closing A&Es, Labour will not oppose them. 'But, as the pressure builds, the case is changing and the Health Secretary must err on the side of caution. The onus is on him to produce convincing evidence or drop these plans.’ He added: ‘Labour will present practical proposals to the Health Secretary which could help staff at the front line. ‘David Cameron and his Health Secretary have been caught out looking for scapegoats rather than finding solutions. They must cut the spin and get a grip without delay.’ When a divert is put in place, ambulances are told to take people elsewhere, although life-threatening cases are still accepted at the original hospital. Official Department of Health guidance say they should only happen in exceptional circumstances. ‘Diversion of patients as a result of lack of physical or staff capacity to deal with attendances or admissions should be an action of last resort,’ it says. Last night a government spokesman said: ‘The NHS is currently meeting the 4hr A&E waiting time target. ‘However, we know that over the past few years A&E has been put under increasing pressure because of rising demand. 'That is why this government is looking at how we address the long term problems facing A&E, something the Labour Party failed to do while they were in office.'","The number of ambulance diversions was up almost a quarter last year .

Cars were skidding into ditches or ploughing into snowdrifts … truckers were forced to abandon jack-knifed lorries … people were wrapped in blankets and shivering against the cold. For up to 13 hours, motorists were stranded on the A23 towards Brighton when a few miserable inches of snowfall turned the road into a skating rink. Tea and sympathy: Members of the Plymouth Brethren approach a stranded motorist on the A23 near Brighton . Glowing in the dark: In high visibility jackets, the Brethren team gathers . But – praise the Lord – salvation was at hand. For the only True Grit that seemed to work was the resolve of a modest group of Christian evangelists, undaunted by the chaos. They became ‘Angels of the A23’ by working until dawn to help desperate motorists who must have wondered if hell would freeze over before they were rescued. More than 30 Plymouth Brethren, as they are called, turned out in a fleet of trucks and four-wheel drive vehicles to tow cars to safety, care for shivering casualties and dispense that most quintessentially English of comforts – hot tea and Bakewell tarts. Yesterday they were hailed as ‘snow saviours’ by those stuck for hours at Handcross, a few miles below the end of the M23 in West Sussex. ‘They were absolutely brilliant,’ one driver said. ‘It would take the council a week to organise something like this. They were angels and everyone was really grateful to see them.’ The Plymouth Brethren is a 200-year-old religious fellowship group without structured hierarchy or  formal membership. Among those on the rescue mission was Mark MacIntyre, who works in the medical supply industry. Sustenance for the needy: Tea, crisps and Bakewell tarts in the 4x4 boot for the stranded motorists . Shining light: Mark McIntyre, from the Plymouth Brethren, helping stranded motorists . He initially arrived around teatime to find his nephew, who was among those stranded. Yesterday he said: ‘When I got up here I realised the severity of the situation and organised the others. ‘The road obviously hadn’t been gritted, or the snow was too much, and there were cars stuck as far as you could see. The snow was just blowing across the road and was gradually turning to ice, making it really treacherous. ‘There were about 30 of us with seven 4x4s. It was a kind of rapid response unit … we were on the scene within about 45 minutes. ‘One of the Land Rovers we have has the facilities to make tea and coffee and had plenty of supplies on board, so we were dishing those out to the police as well as people who were stuck in their cars. ‘Everyone was really grateful. A hot drink can mean a lot when you are stuck outside at night. ‘By the time we left at about 4.30am the snow ploughs seemed to be on top of the situation.’ Alas, the Brethren couldn’t reach all parts of the country yesterday. Despite Highways Agency teams working at ‘full capacity’ through the night, dozens of stranded Sussex drivers bombarded the internet with complaints that they never saw a gritter or a snow plough. The chaos caused by Britain’s worst spring freeze for 27 years spread rapidly across the country. As well as the roads, airports and railways were also hit, bringing most of the south east to a standstill. All Eurostar rail services were suspended. Although snowfall in isolated patches reached 4.7inches, the worst-hit areas of Sussex and Kent experienced only a couple of inches. But thanks to the fact that the snow did not settle but turned to ice as temperatures plummeted as low as -3C, it became unusually treacherous. The AA was expected to have attended more than 15,000 calls by the end of last night – almost double the normal rate. Guernsey and Jersey airports were closed. The Channel Tunnel shut for six hours, causing huge delays on the M20 in Kent. The M20 car park: Lorries queue near Ashford in Kent . A ferry carrying 500 passengers from Ireland to France was stranded at sea in high winds off the French coast for nearly 20 hours. Although the Highways Agency insisted it had been prepared for the bad weather, some gritters were unable to salt their usual routes because of obstructions or abandoned cars. A spokesman said: ‘We knew  this was coming. It was forecast,  we had plans in place and we  followed them.’ Additional reporting: REBECCA EVANS . By Rebecca Evans and Nick Fagge . Maybe Mother Nature grew a little bored with a classic blanket of white. So yesterday she put on quite a show, etching amazing shapes in the snow and letting winds and ice carve out the most stunning handiwork. Paul and Clare Ballard were amazed to find the windscreen of their car transformed into a snow tube or snow roller. Game of ice marbles anyone? Individual blades of grass bear droplets of water, frozen as they sprayed from a fountain . It was created thanks to a combination of lying snow and high winds, which rolled a layer of snow into the distinctive curled shape before another layer fell on the glass. The unusual phenomenon requires a precise balance of air temperature, ice, snow, moisture and wind.

Over in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, she left the grass scattered with a collection of ‘ice marbles’. Blades bore individual bubbles of ice, formed after water spray from a nearby fountain froze as soon as it hit the ground. The spray also decorated a nearby park bench with a fringe of icicles, which formed as the water froze before it could drip off the wood. Snow tubes are most commonly found in . the frozen extremes of  North America and are also known as snow . rollers, snow bales and snow doughnuts. Fringed in ice: A bench etched in white . Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers was delighted at the sight. ‘It looks like the snow has melted slightly and the wind has peeled it off the windscreen, forming a roll, and fresh snow has fallen on to the windscreen,’ she said. ‘I suppose it’s nature’s version of making a snowman. ‘A classic snow roll will happen mostly in North America and in Northern Europe, and they can be as small as a tennis ball or as large as 2ft across –  depending on how strong the wind is and how smooth the surface of the snow is.’ Icy conditions: Spray from a fountain creating ice formations in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire .","Motorists stranded on A23 towards Brighton for us to 13 hours .

Nick Mulligan had been enjoying a break at the £2million dream home he had built overlooking Daymer Bay in Cornwall . The devastated family of Padstow speedboat victim Nick Milligan yesterday said they were taking comfort from the fact that he and his daughter had died in a place they loved. The Sky TV executive had been enjoying a break at the £2million dream home he had built overlooking Daymer Bay in Cornwall when he and his youngest daughter Emily, eight, were killed. The 51-year-old had taken his wife Victoria, 41, and their four children – Amber, 12, Olivia, ten, Emily and Kit, four – out on their boat when it tipped over. Yesterday his younger brother Max Milligan, 48, described him as an ‘extremely loving father, husband, son and brother’. He said: ‘That he and my delightful niece died in their favourite place at the end of a gloriously sunny bank holiday offers a tiny glimmer of light.’ Mr Milligan had built his luxury beach house – which he described as his ‘most treasured possession’– after enjoying family holidays in the area as a boy. ‘As children and teenagers we spent many summers and New Year’s Eves at Polzeath in Cornwall,’ his brother said yesterday. ‘A few years ago he built his dream home above Daymer Bay.’ The family spent most of their holidays at the property in the small village of Trebetherick, where poet John Betjeman is buried and half a mile from Polzeath, a favourite holiday haunt for princes William and Harry.Mr Milligan kept his boat at moorings in Rock, across the estuary from Padstow. The family used the £60,000 rib [rigid inflatable boat], which shared Mr Milligan’s nickname ‘Milly’, for trips on the estuary. The TV executive, who described his interests as including ‘anything outdoors’, had a permit to use the vessel for waterskiing in the area. Last night his colleagues paid tribute to a ‘wonderful man’ and ‘well-respected boss’. Scroll down for video . The 51-year-old had taken his wife Victoria, 41, and their four children - Amber, 12, Olivia, ten, Emily and Kit, four - out on their boat when it tipped over . A spokesman for Sky Media, where he had been managing director on a seven-figure salary, said: ‘Everyone at Sky is deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the tragic accident involving the Milligan family. ‘Nick has been a great friend and colleague for many years and his loss will be felt across our company and the industry. Our very deepest sympathies are with his family at this time.’ Guy Zitter, the managing director of Mail Newspapers – which publishes the Daily Mail – said: ‘Nick was one of the most respected and loved people in the industry. The entire London media community will be deeply shocked. ‘He was very, very good with people. Everyone he came across found him utterly charming and delightful, with an excellent sense of humour, and he possessed a deep understanding of the business and the way it worked. ‘He settled down relatively late, but was absolutely devoted to his wife and kids. ‘This was a very successful man operating at the very top of his industry, with a family he adored. One minute you are in a boat thinking how could life be better than this, and the next minute everything around you is despair and destruction. It is just unimaginably awful.’ Mr Milligan was known in the industry for being ‘almost obsessively competitive’ with an ‘intense desire to win’. Yesterday at the couple’s £6million home in West London, neighbours described them as ‘one of the nicest families in the area’. Their home in one of the most exclusive parts of the capital is just a stone’s throw from the houses of Gordon Ramsay and David Walliams. Neighbour Olivia Henderson, 51, who has known the family for ten years, said: ‘It was a horrible accident. It’s so sad. Everyone is just shocked and upset by what has happened. Nick was a nice family man who was great with his kids. He was one of the nicest guys locally. He did a lot in the community.’ She added: ‘Little Emily was a sweet little girl. She would be out on the street in her school uniform, playing on her scooter. She was always smiling. ‘Vicky looked after them so well. They were always polite and well turned out. They were just a lovely, beautiful family.’","Nick Milligan  had been enjoying a break at his £2million dream home .

"By . John Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 01:45 EST, 30 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:06 EST, 30 May 2013 . A retired professional man has become the first British dementia patient to end his life at the Dignitas clinic. The wealthy 83-year-old chose to travel to the controversial clinic in Switzerland because he did not want to face the agony of the progressive disease. He is believed to be the first person to use the clinic’s services solely because of dementia. End of his life: An 83-year-old Briton has become the first from this country to chose assisted suicide at the Dignitas clinic near Zurich (pictured) because he has dementia . The unnamed man from England went to . the clinic after obtaining a report from a psychiatrist stating he was . mentally competent to choose to kill himself. Retired GP Michael Irwin, who helped . the man make his preparations, including the visit to the psychiatrist, . said that he was ‘so grateful at the end’. Dr Irwin – nicknamed Dr Death because . of the number of people he has helped end their lives at the clinic – . said that the man wanted to spare his family from the strain his illness . might put on them and that they ‘absolutely’ backed his decision. The man’s wife made the travel . arrangements for the trip to Zurich and accompanied him. Dr Irwin said: . ‘I’ve spoken to the widow since she came back and she thought it was a . very dignified departure that he had – very well handled by the Swiss. Controversial: Michael Irwin, nicknamed Dr Death, has publicised the death of the unnamed pensioner and has helped others die at Dignitas . Final resting place: Patients at Dignitas are taken to a room like this one and fed a cocktail of drugs that kills them in 30 minutes . Record numbers of Britons end their lives at Dignitas each year, while their relatives escape investigation for helping them. The Swiss clinic aided 33 people from this country to die last year – the highest ever annual figure – pushing the total during the past decade close to 250. Aiding or encouraging a suicide remains illegal in England and Wales under the 1961 Suicide Act and punishable by up to 14 years’ imprisonment. But CPS guidelines published in 2010 spelled out that relatives would not be charged if they acted out of compassion to help a terminally ill person end their suffering. Dignitas, set up in 1998, allows foreigners to use its services, and its own figures show that upwards of 200 Britons have now died there – with 33 deaths last year, up from 22 the year before. Anyone who wants the organisation’s help must become a member, pay about £10,000 and see a local doctor before being given a fatal dose of drugs to drink. The CPS’s statistics reveal that police passed them 44 files on assisted suicides and cases of euthanasia – where a doctor administers the fatal dose – between 2009 and 2011. By October 2012, the total had reached 66, including deaths in England and Wales as well as abroad. Of these, prosecutors chose not to proceed with 45, nine were withdrawn and 12 were still being looked into. ‘He was aware of the consequences of . dementia. He knew what was going to happen to him. 'He was very clear . about that. That is why he wanted to go when he did. 'Anybody who is . diagnosed with dementia who has any idea what dementia is like would be . scared silly about what was going to happen to him or her. ‘He didn’t want to go through it. Quite rightly so. His choice. He made a very sensible decision for himself and his family.’ Dr Irwin, who is co-ordinator of the . Society for Old Age Rational Suicide, claims to have helped at least 25 . people to die at the clinic. 'In the past he has been interviewed by . police, but never arrested. 'Assisted suicide is a criminal offence in . the UK and carries a maximum jail sentence of 14 years, but is allowed . in Switzerland. Lord Falconer, a former Lord . Chancellor, earlier this month launched a private member’s Bill in the . Lords to make assisted dying legal for the terminally ill. Dr Irwin said he believes the debate . should be extended to include those with dementia. He added: ‘In the . early stages of dementia you are still mentally competent to decide that . you would like your life to end. 'Once a diagnosis has been made, there . is a period of a year or 18 months in which your degree of mental . competence is still OK for that type of decision.’ But critics have warned that if euthanasia is legalised there would be pressure on those eligible to end their lives. A spokesman for Care Not Killing said: . ‘We’ve been warning about an incremental approach, as once you change . the law you get more and more cases like this, which is why we are so . worried. ‘We know that people who are vulnerable, disabled and terminally ill will be most under pressure.’ More than 800,000 people in Britain . suffer from dementia and the number is set to rise to more than a . million by 2021 and 1.7 million by 2050. There is currently no cure. Since Dignitas opened in 1998 more . than 200 Britons have died there. The price of suicide is believed to be . around £5,000, but can be up to £7,000 when including funerals, medical . costs and official fees.","Pensioner's family are said to have backed his decision '100 per cent'

Hero: Watersports instructor Charlie Toogood is believed to have brought a runaway speedboat under control in Padstow . A sports instructor who risked his life by leaping on to the out-of- control speedboat was hailed a hero yesterday. Charlie Toogood and a friend sped to the rescue in another boat after seeing the Milligan family in the sea. They drew level with the stricken vessel as it raced round in circles, allowing Mr Toogood to jump into it. He then managed to kill the engine and halt the boat. Police and coastguards yesterday praised Mr Toogood’s ‘incredible seamanship and bravery’ which prevented further tragedy during the horrifying accident. His actions are credited with saving the lives of Nick Milligan’s wife Victoria and daughters Amber, 12, and Olivia, ten, and son Kit, four. Matt Pavitt, from the North Cornwall Coastguard, said: ‘He managed to manoeuvre his boat alongside the vessel which was going round and round in circles, picked his moment and jumped.’ Mr Pavitt said two kayakers and at least three other pleasure boats went to the aid of the family ‘within minutes’ of the disaster. He added: ‘One of the kayakers actually managed to manoeuvre in between the boat while it was still circling to provide aid to some people incredibly quickly.’ Detective Superintendent Jim Colwell said: ‘Without the brave and heroic efforts of local people and holidaymakers in the minutes immediately after this incident in assisting the family while they were in the water, I’m confident that this would have been far worse in terms of the overall death toll.’ Mr Toogood, a married father in his early 30s, declined to talk about his heroics last night. His mother Sarah said he was ‘in a bit of a state’. Another friend added: ‘He is devastated. Everyone is rightly calling  him a hero, but he felt he was helpless that he couldn’t do more to save the others.’ Teenager Will Jones was named as the helmsman of Mr Toogood’s boat. His sister Amy said: ‘My brother is still very shaken up from it all.’ Hundreds . of holidaymakers watched in horror as the speedboat then raced round in . circles, its propeller slashing the helpless victims and turning the . water 'red with blood'. Mr Jones, 19, later wrote on Facebook: 'After today the next few days are going to be very difficult to process. Thoughts are with those who are involved in the accident.'

Mr Toogood, is a married father of a five-month-old daughter, runs the Camel Ski School, . which rents out equipment for holidaymakers as well as offering . activities such as water-skiing. He has given a statement to police, but has not spoken publicly about his role in the tragic incident. His mother Sarah told the Daily Telegraph that her son was 'in a bit of a state' after the accident, and was too traumatised to speak about his actions. 'It's wonderful that his actions have been praised but it was an awful tragedy,' she said.

He said: ‘We saw a boat coming up the . estuary and it seemed to take a right turn. As it took the turn it . flopped and the people in the boat went out in the water and then the . boat went round in circles and it seemed to come back into the group on . three or four occasions. ‘We heard screaming and saw seagulls . coming into the water, it wasn’t good.

A northern California region marked by towering redwood trees and mountains rising out of the Pacific is the focus of an intensive search for a suspect in the shooting deaths of his wife and two young daughters. Shane Franklin Miller, considered armed and dangerous, grew up in coastal Humboldt County and authorities say that his ability to fortify himself in an area so remote it's called the ""lost coast"" makes searchers vulnerable. 'It would be easy to hide out up there,' said local resident Phil Franklin, one of hundreds ordered to lock doors and shelter in place as the manhunt expands. Wanted: Police are searching for Shane Franklyn Miller, 45, who is wanted in connection to the Tuesday killings of his wife, 34, and two young daughters, aged 4 and 8 . Authorities believe the 45-year-old . Miller has taken refuge somewhere in the area around Petrolia since his . truck was found nearby on Wednesday. The bodies of Miller's wife Sandy, 34, . and two daughters, Shasta, 4, and Shelby, 8, were discovered earlier . this week at the family's home in Shingletown. Officials would not . disclose how the victims died. A . sheriff's investigator said Miller's retreat into the mountainous woods . creates a dangerous situation for officers trying to track him. 'It's almost like warfare,' said Lt. Dave Kent of the Shasta County Sheriff's Office, which is handling the investigation. To . imagine the ruggedness of the landscape think 'Jurrasic Park' because . some of the movie was filmed there. Many residents live off the grid on . unmarked back roads often shrouded in a coastal fog. Folks in . this community of 200 miles north of San Francisco have been ordered to . leave a contact number tacked to their front doors if they evacuate so . that so law enforcement can verify their safety. Crime scene: Police are investigating the murder of the mother and two daughters killed at this home on Tuesday night. They are searching for Shane Franklin Miller, named as the main suspect . 'We . assume he's still in the valley, but he could have gotten help from . somebody,' said Franklin who runs the Petrolia Guest House, one of the . few businesses in a town so-named because the first California oil well . was drilled there. 'We're all locked down here. We're supposed to call . 911 if we see anything suspicious.' On Thursday tactical search . teams from Shasta, Humboldt and Mendocino counties asked for assistance . from other agencies, including the swat team from Pelican Bay State . Prison in Crescent City near the Oregon border that is trained in . apprehending escaped prisoners, said Terry Thornton, spokeswoman for the . state prisons. They were instructed to meet at the incident command . post, the Petrolia Volunteer Fire Department, at 6 a.m. Friday, she . said. Authorities say he is familiar with the tree-lined canyons . so steep that only one paved, pot-holed road serves the area. They . suspected he might be heading to a cabin he frequents, but there were no . sightings reported on Thursday. On the lookout: Shasta County Sheriff's deputies investigate the scene of a triple homicide. Authorities are searching for Shane Franklin Miller who is suspected of fatally shooting his wife and two young daughters at their home . Like Franklin, most of the . residents are armed because law enforcement patrols are rare in this . community built on a peninsula that juts into the Pacific. 'The . county is strapped for money so we don't have police protection out . here. We all contact each other if something occurs so we can coordinate . help,' Franklin said. A woman who identified herself as Miller's . mother told the Associated Press on Thursday that she had not . communicated with her son since the shooting and was unaware of problems . in the marriage. Miller is familiar to law enforcement. He once . tried to make a living growing one of the region's biggest cash crops -- . marijuana. In 1996 he was convicted of felony cultivation in a county . known worldwide for the high quality pot grown in the same hard-to-reach . forests authorities now are combing. Fugitive: Shane Franklin Miller, 45, has been on the loose for more than three days now since the killings on Tuesday in Shingletown, Northern California . In 2002, Miller was charged . in San Francisco with making and selling marijuana for distribution, . being a felon in possession of a firearm, possessing a machine gun and . money laundering, according to court records. He pleaded guilty to being . a felon in possession of a gun and was sentenced to three years and 10 . months in prison. He was released in May 2007, according to the federal . Bureau of Prisons. He served 46 months in federal prison for being a felon in possession of a firearm, court records show. He . apparently stayed off the radar of law enforcement until 7:45 p.m. on . Tuesday, when Shasta County Sheriff's deputies received a call from his . house. When they arrived, they found the bodies of Miller's wife, Sandy, . 34, and two daughters, Shelby, 8, and Shasta, 5. All three had been shot multiple times, said Lt. Kent. Kent . said investigators had not determined who placed the call, but he said . it was from one of the victims as the shooting was in progress. Authorities . also have not recovered the gun, or guns, believed to have been used in . the shooting, but Kent said more weapons were found in the house.","Shane Franklin Miller, considered armed and dangerous .

Arms and legs flailing helplessly, this paraglider might have felt like dying of embarrassment...if it hadn’t been for a far more realistic threat to his life. He was dangling from wires carrying 11,000 volts and said later he could feel the current rushing through his body as he came perilously close to being electrocuted. Scroll down for video . Stuck: The paraglider was left dangling from this electric cable (left) but managed to free himself and jump to safety just before this picture was taken . For ten minutes the pilot battled frantically to free himself, all the time fearing he was about to receive a fatal shock. He eventually managed to free himself and leapt to the ground with burns only to his right hand and leg to show for the ordeal...though he also managed to black out local homes for an hour as the power was cut. The 30-year-old businessman, who is so embarrassed by the incident he would give his name only as Daniel, said he feared for his life after misjudging the landing in March, Cambridgeshire. ‘I was coming in to land, following a friend. I came over low and then found the lines in front of me. I just didn’t see them. ‘We had a safety briefing before, and it was totally my fault. ‘My leg got caught on the line, but I managed to release myself and get clear from the lines. By then I was only a few feet from the ground, so I jumped down. It was scary. I feared for my life and I continually thought I was going to be electrocuted.’ Trapped: Dangling precariously, the pilot desperately tries to free himself and jump to safety.

Escape: The wrecked paramotor is left dangling from the electric cable after the pilot managed to free himself and jump four feet to safety . Daniel, who has six years’ experience in power paragliding, spent Sunday night under observation in the burns unit at Chelmsford Hospital in Essex but returned home the following day. Nigel Davies, 45, who runs the Fenland Wind and Airsports Centre, where Daniel was attempting to land, said the crash was a ‘freak accident’. He said: ‘We have been here for seven years, and this is the first accident we have had.’ Brian Dobson, 50, who captured Daniel’s plight on camera, said: ‘He was up there for a good ten minutes. He said he could feel electricity coming through his body. ‘If anyone had touched him they would . have got a shock. He managed to free himself and the emergency services . arrived five minutes later.’ Some 45 homes lost power as a result of . the crash but their supply was restored later the same evening. Despite his ordeal, Daniel plans to return to paragliding soon. He said: ‘I’ve had a setback but I . can’t wait to get back in the air. It is a great sport with great people . and a great community. It really brings people together.’ Approach: Another paramotor pilot comes into land at the airstrip in March, Cambridgeshire.

Astonishing: A survey commissioned by The Ramblers found a quarter of people walk for less than nine minutes a day - and that includes time spent getting to the car, to work and to the shops . Whether it's a stroll in the country or a trot around the block, going for a walk is generally seen as good exercise. But almost half of us are not doing enough of it to stay healthy, researchers suggest. And they claim that, astonishingly, a quarter of us walk for less than nine minutes a day, or under an hour a week on average – and that includes time spent getting to the car, to work and to the shops. That was despite the fact that an overwhelming majority, 93 per cent, of those questioned agreed that walking was a good form of exercise that can keep you healthy. Health guidelines from the Chief Medical Officer recommend that adults do two-and-a-half hours a week of moderate physical activity, such as walking. But 43 per cent of those asked said they walk for two hours or less a week. The survey of 2,000 adults was commissioned by the Ramblers, formerly the Ramblers Association, to mark the start of Get Walking Week. The Ramblers said that the results showed a 'pandemic of inactivity'. It is launching a campaign to get 100,000 more people going for regular strolls as part of their daily lives. Chief executive Benedict Southworth said: 'We want people all over Britain to join . the walking revolution and take their first steps towards a healthier . and happier lifestyle. 'Walking is one of the most accessible . and achievable ways to conquer this inactivity pandemic in Britain, and . we need to get started now.

Walking for Health scheme or Ramblers group during Get Walking Week and . join us as we get Britain moving.' Health spokesperson: Diane Abbott said the figures were 'worrying' Medical experts have warned that life expectancies could fall because of a lack of walking. William Bird, a GP who specialises in . the benefits of exercise, said: 'We're going to find this generation . will die earlier than their parents if they don't start doing basic . movement. 'We all age quicker when we're not . moving and the consequences of that are age-related diseases, such as . diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.' He added: 'A lot of doctors know very . little at all about the importance of physical activity and it's at the . bottom of their list, but if you got everyone walking it would have a . massive effect on the health of the country.' Diane Abbott, Labour's spokesperson for public health, said the figures were a 'worrying' indication of the nation's health. She said: 'If the average person is so inactive then that means that most children aren't seeing adults being active, which will only contribute to the obesity epidemic.' She added: 'We need to plan activity into the way buildings are designed. The first thing you see in a building is often a lift - then you have to look for the stairs.

"PUBLISHED: . 08:04 EST, 4 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:06 EST, 4 June 2012 . Rare illness: Douglas Husband has had to be put on a tightly controlled diet . Meal times are predictable affairs for little Douglas Husband, who lives off a diet of potatoes - as any other food leaves him screaming in pain. The 19-month-old's mother has found her son can tolerate spuds and butternut squash, but meat, fruit and vegetables leave him writhing in agony. Brave Douglas suffers from eosinophilic colitis, a rare condition where too many white blood cells are produced in his intestine. As a result the cells designed to protect his body actually attack it. The youngster had a normal, natural . birth and, even though he arrived into the world with the umbilical cord . wrapped around his neck and needed resuscitating, he made a quick . recovery. He was soon sent home to join mother Beverley Ward, father Tim . Husband and four-year-old sister Edie in Sheffield. At . first when he went home he seemed fine but he was unable to settle . easily to sleep. After a few weeks he developed a cold and started . choking, before going limp and blue in his mother's arms. Concerned . Beverley, 41, a writer, said: 'The day Douglas went blue and limp in my . arms was the most horrendous moment of my life, I thought he was dying. 'I . called 999 and within minutes the paramedics were at the door. He came . round when they arrived and we took him in the ambulance to the . Children’s Hospital in Sheffield.' Fed up with seeing her little boy . screaming in agony whenever he was fed, Beverley decided to film him . feeding and showed it to the hospital. After . a colonoscopy and endoscopy at Sheffield Children’s Hospital under . specialist Mike Thompson, Douglas was finally diagnosed with . eosinophilic colitis when he was 19 months old, which is a result of . stomach acid leaking back into the oesophagus. His mother added: 'Now we are still learning about the condition and what works for Douglas and what doesn’t. Trial and error: Beverley Ward says she has tried feeding her son Douglas about 30 different foods, but so far only potatoes and butternut squash have worked . Little Douglas was initially diagnosed with bronchiolitis, and despite not having the same problems as other babies on the ward he was discharged and Beverley continued to breastfeed him. She said: 'Once home, he continued to . choke at feeds and his breathing always seemed laboured. It turned me . into a nervous wreck. 'He . was generally a happy-go-lucky little chap until I tried to feed him and . he’d sob through his feeds. He seemed to be waking up all night . screaming in pain. It seemed that his bowels were causing him trouble as . well.' 'If he has an allergic reaction to . food he scratches at his face, screams through the night, is . bad-tempered during the day and suffers with severe constipation and . diarrhoea. He can also come out in hives and it makes him quite ill. 'It’s . completely trial and error, we try foods and see what he can tolerate. So far he can only manage to eat two foods, butternut squash and potato. Bland: A typical meal for Douglas consists of squash and potato cut up and cooked in different ways - but his condition means his parents cannot even use oil . 'I try to mix it up through the day, so he has mashed potato for breakfast, baked potatoes for lunch and I’ve recently started cutting the potato up into chunks so it looks like chips - although we can’t use any oil on them. 'We’ve tried him on about 30 foods . including meat, vegetables, fruit and rice, but he just reacts to . everything, so we’re reluctant to try him on much else. 'He can only drink water and a . hypoallergenic formula called Neocate which provides him with all his . nutrients so people are surprised at how healthy he looks. 'It . is really sad that, at a time when we should be excitedly trying our . son on lots of new foods, we are so scared of the reaction he might . have. 'We’ve tried a range . of drugs. Some of them have helped him but some have made his condition . much worse as he reacts to the ingredients in the medicines in the same . way as he reacts to food and can have different allergic reactions to . things like colours and flavourings. 'We . have to watch him closely as he mixes with other children to ensure . that he doesn’t eat anything that will make him ill. It can be . heartbreaking to have to keep saying ""no"" to him. 'He is now on a new drug which seems . to have stabilised him a little but he is still only eating potato and . butternut squash. Like all children he can be faddy, it’s a real worry . when he seems to have gone off one of his foods.' Mike . Thomson, specialist from the Children’s Hospital, Sheffield, said: . 'Children like Douglas often go a long time without being recognised, as . in some ways this is a relatively new set of diseases to general . practice and paediatrics alike. Compliments to the chef: Douglas looks delighted with his plain food but his parents wish they could try giving him more varied meals . 'While it will usually resolve with time it may take many years and other related problems such as eosinophilic oesophagitis - which is likened to eczema of the gullet - can ensue and last into adulthood. 'We are fortunate that a number of parent-led groups are beginning to flag this set of problems up to the wider community, but it is our responsibility as health care teams to recognise these conditions early and act appropriately with a referral to a paediatric gastroenterology department.' Beverley added: 'It has been a long, hard journey to get to where we are but we are determined to learn more about this little known condition and to raise awareness so that children are more easily diagnosed.'","Other foods leave 19-month-old Douglas Husband writhing in agony .

As reforms to legal aid come into force today, people who represent themselves in court have been told not to behave like TV's fast-talking lawyer Ally McBeal (above) As reforms to legal aid come into force today, people who represent themselves in court have been told not to behave like TV's fast-talking lawyer Ally McBeal. The advice forms part of a layman's guide to courtroom etiquette, issued by the Bar Council - and includes handy tips such as: 'You might be tempted to speak like lawyers on TV. Resist the temptation. 'Lawyers do not really speak like that. Some bad lawyers do, but judges hate it.' It comes as legal aid will no longer . be available for whole classes of compensation claims, including those . made over medical negligence, personal injury and employment law. Taxpayer support will also be withdrawn from many family law, education, immigration, debt, housing and benefit disputes. Other advice offered in the booklet, A Guide To Representing Yourself In Court, states: 'Make sure you speak loudly, slowly and clearly,' according to the Independent. The manual, which will be distributed to all MPs in England and Wales, also suggests you dress smartly and turn up early. The 74-page 'idiot's guide', put together by top barristers, adds: 'Make sure you know what you're supposed to be calling the judge and whether you are supposed to stand up every time you speak (ask the usher beforehand if you are unsure). 'If you cannot find the usher, just say ""Sir"" or ""Madam"".' Another vital pointer says: 'Always be completely honest with the judge and with any officials. 'There can be very serious consequences if you deliberately lie or even bend the truth.' The reforms to the Legal Aid, . Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act (Laspo) come into immediate . effect as the Government moves to reduce its £2.2billion legal aid . bill by £350million. Private family law, such as divorce and custody . battles, personal injury cases, some employment and education law, . immigration cases where the person is not detained and some debt, . housing and benefit issues will all be impacted. The Bar Council's guide comes as legal aid will no longer be available for whole classes of compensation claims, including those made over medical negligence, personal injury and employment law. (Above, TV show Kavanagh QC) Some law firms estimate the reforms . will reduce the number of people who qualify for legal aid by 75 per cent, . meaning around 200,000 fewer cases, while barristers have warned the . cuts are the biggest to civil legal aid since the system was introduced . in 1949. And to assist those representing themselves in a civil action, the guide also offers help on how to put together your own case, deal with specific areas of law and defend a claim. The Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, warned that 'people could start taking the law into their own hands as a result of an inability to seek justice following the Government's civil legal aid cuts'. Richard Miller, head of Legal Aid at the Law Society, said: 'We have warned Government consistently that, as well as all the knock-on costs, the social consequences will be damaging to the whole of society, not just the vulnerable who will take the worst hit of all.' The Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, said 'vulnerable people will suffer' as a result of the changes. Maura McGowan QC, chair of the Bar Council, said: 'As a result of Laspo, more people than ever before will find themselves going to court without legal representation. 'It is not just the view of the Bar - the Judiciary, the broader legal profession and legal advice centres are all saying the same thing. 'We are faced with a situation whereby access to justice is no longer being adequately funded and vulnerable people will suffer.' Cases that will continue to receive funding include family law cases involving domestic violence, forced marriage or child abduction issues, mental health cases, asylum and debt and housing matters where someone's home is at immediate risk. The changes have prompted a raft of warnings from law firms across the country. The removal of legal aid for divorce cases will hit the UK's poorest households almost three times harder than people in the richest parts of the country, according to research by family law firm Stephensons. The average cost of a divorce is £1,300 or 9 per cent of the average yearly income in Dwyfor Meirionnydd in North Wales, the UK constituency with the lowest average salary, Stephensons said. By contrast, £1,300 is equal to just 3.3 per cent of the average annual income in Westminster North, which has the UK's highest average salary. Elsewhere, Quality Solicitors warned low-income parents may be left unable to afford necessary legal representation to secure contact rights with their children following divorce. And Hugh James Solicitors argued that the number of individuals taking divorce and children cases to court as 'self representing litigants' as a result of the withdrawal of aid could burden the courts with more 'long-running and poorly organised cases'. A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: 'We need to make sure taxpayers' money is not spent resolving too many disputes in court, when there are quicker, cheaper and less stressful options available. 'At £2 billion a year we have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world, and it's now costing taxpayers too much at time when resources are not limitless. 'We had to make some difficult decisions, and it was not a process we embarked on lightly, but we have safeguarded legal aid to ensure lawyers are there for those who really need them.' 'Taking the law into their own hands' Last month, a senior judge was accused of meddling in politics after saying that legal aid cuts would bring lawlessness. Lord Neuberger, the head of the country’s highest court, warned that stripping half a million Britons of the right to free lawyers would ‘lead to people taking the law into their own hands’. He added that cuts to free legal advice and free courtroom lawyers would ‘start to undermine the rule of law’. Criticising the judge’s remarks, Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘If the system of justice over which his lordship presides was not so inaccessible to my constituents, justice would be even-handed in the first place. ‘But the self-serving legal elite has made justice so expensive that the state has had to subsidise lawyers. Lord Neuberger should concentrate on providing cheaper justice and stop bellyaching.’ Criminologist Dr David Green, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘It is inappropriate for the president of the Supreme Court to make such political comments.' The judge’s remarks were a shot across the bows of Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, who recently announced more legal aid reforms. These will try to reduce the price of taxpayer-funded defence lawyers in criminal cases by making law firms submit competitive tenders for criminal legal aid work, so that solicitors and barristers would be forced to compete on price for work. Tory and Labour governments and now the Coalition have all tried to reform legal aid since the 1980s, during which time taxpayer spending on lawyers’ bills has more than quadrupled to £2.1billion a year. Official figures show that in the financial year to March 2011, six barristers each made more than £500,000 from criminal legal aid cases. Another was paid more than £450,000 for civil legal aid cases.","Legal aid will no longer .

The biggest shake-up of the welfare state in British history comes today as a wide range of cost-cutting austerity measures take effect for the first time. The Coalition is hoping to save billions of pounds by slashing legal aid, limiting benefits handouts and restructuring the NHS. The average family is set to be £5,000 worse-off than at the time of the last election - but Government ministers insist their reforms will make the system 'fairer'. Scroll down for video . Cost-cutting: George Osborne steps up his austerity programme today with wide-ranging benefit cuts . While critics have accused the Coalition of targeting poor families and the disabled while handing millionaires a tax cut, top officials dismiss the claims as 'shrill'. George Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith today said that their welfare changes were not 'the beginning of the end of the world'. They continued: 'In reality, we are just restoring the original principles of the welfare state: that those who can work must work, and a life on benefits must not be more attractive than working.' 'Bedroom tax' comes into effect today . Perhaps the most controversial move is the so-called 'bedroom tax', which will see social housing tenants with spare rooms docked an average of £14 a week in benefits. Around 660,000 people are set to lose some of their housing benefit from the change, which is expected to save the Government £465million a year. The charge is aimed at reducing over-crowding in social housing and directing benefits towards those who are most in need. But Labour has relentless attacked the move, with shadow chancellor Ed Balls denouncing it as 'possibly the worst, most cack-handed and massively unfair piece of policy-making I've ever seen'. Defence: Iain Duncan Smith insists the changes will make the welfare system 'fairer' for claimants and taxpayers . Legal aid cut drastically from today . Financial help in the legal system is set to be restricted to those whose household income is less than £32,000, with means-testing for all but the poorest claimants. Divorce cases, personal injury and immigration appeals will no longer be covered by legal aid, meaning that experts expect a spike in the number of plaintiffs who will represent themselves in court. The aim is to cut the £2.2billion legal aid bill by at least £350million. NHS commissioning changes today . After nearly three years of wrangling, the National Health Service faces its widest-ranging reforms ever today, with commissioning handed over to consortiums of GPs. Private companies will be allowed to compete to provide state-funded services for the first time, which ministers hope will drive down costs in the NHS. The abolition of strategic health authorities and primary care trusts is expected to save £1.4billion in the short term with savings rising to £5billion by the time of the next election in 2015. Council tax benefit cut from today . Council tax refunds for low-income households will today be transferred from the Department of Work and Pensions into the control of local councils. Officials are using the switch as an opportunity to cut the size of the benefit by 10 per cent, saving as much as half a billion pounds a year. In additions, 2.4million families will have their council tax bill raised, despite the Coalition's attempts to keep the cost of the tax down. Out of work: The changes are aimed at forcing the jobless back into employment . 50p tax rate abolished on Saturday . This weekend, high earners will find have the rate of tax charged on earnings over £100,000 cut from 50p to 45p. Mr Osborne announced the move in last year's Budget in a bid to make Britain more business-friendly, claiming the 50p rate had raised £15billion less than expected. However, Labour has denounced it as a millionaires' tax cut, with 13,000 of the super-rich saving £100,000 each. Benefit 'uprating' starts a week on Monday . Next Monday, benefits will see their annual rise - but they will be increased by just one per cent, which is lower than the rate of inflation. The Coalition has limited the rise in benefits for the next three years due to the slow rate of wages growth, claiming it is unfair for the unemployed to see their earnings rise faster than those in work. The measure is supposed to save £505million this year, with further savings for as long as it remains in place. Disability living allowance abolished next Monday . On the same day, disability living allowance will be replaced by personal independence payment. The idea is to correlate benefits payments more closely to the needs of the disabled - so they will no longer be determined by claimants' medical conditions, but by how their disability affects what they can do. But campaigners are concerned that the change will provide an excuse to limit payouts to the disabled in order to save money. Benefit cap begins on April 15 . The centrepiece of the Coalition's welfare reforms is the promise to limit each family's handouts to the average household income. The scheme will be piloted in four London boroughs from April 15, and it is set to take effect throughout the country by the end of September. No household will be entitled to receive more than £26,000 in benefits each year, although working tax credits are not included in the total. Universal credit rolls out on April 28 . Six of the main benefits payments are being integrated into a single system, starting with a trial scheme in Aston-under-Lyne from April 28. The move is supposed to simplify the process of paying and receiving benefits, and make it easier to job-seekers to find work. Criticism: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls described the 'bedroom tax' as 'cack-handed and massively unfair' Changes set to leave families £5,000 poorer overall . Overall, a family earning a total of £34,000 will have lost £4,747 this year compared to three years ago, according to think-tank the Resolution Foundation. Despite a rise in the personal income tax allowance which will save most people around £270 a year, cuts to working tax credit, child benefit and child tax credit will leave most households worse off. The allowance - the amount of money on which no tax is due - will rise from £8,105 to £9,440 in the coming tax year as part of a major Coalition policy inspired by the Liberal Democrats. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Osborne and Mr Duncan Smith said: 'Our changes will ensure that the welfare state offers the right help to those who need it, and is fair to those who pay for it. 'Of course, if you listened to the shrill voices of the Left you'd think that every change to the welfare system, and any attempt to save money, marks the beginning of the end of the world. 'In reality, we are just restoring the original principles of the welfare state: that those who can work must work, and a life on benefits must not be more attractive than working.' Ending what ministers call a 'spare room subsidy' would address the 'scandal' of a million people living in overcrowded conditions and millions more on waiting lists, they added. But shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said: 'This wicked bedroom tax is going to rip neighbour from neighbour, force vulnerable people to food banks and loan sharks, and end up costing Britain more than it saves as tenants are forced to go homeless or move into the expensive private rented sector. 'It is the worst possible blend of cruelty and incompetence. The Government must think again and drop this tax now.' Pensions Minister Steve Webb insisted the highest earners had taken the biggest hit, telling ITV1's Daybreak this morning: 'We are trying to make savings but we're also trying to protect the most vulnerable. 'We're not saying you can't have a spare bedroom, what we are saying is you contribute £2 a day on average if you have that extra bedroom. Some people, yes money's tight, but will say £2 a day for a spare bedroom is worth paying, others will swap with others into smaller accommodation.'

It looks like this man has had the folds of his brain tattooed across his head - but instead this is a rare medical condition. The skull of the 21-year-old Brazilian patient, described this week in the New England Journal of Medicine, looked perfectly normal two years ago. But then his scalp started to change, growing thicker in irregular places, resulting in bizarre folds of thicker skin across his head in a pattern that unintentionally mirrors the shape of the brain. The rare condition 'cutis verticis gyrate' made this 21-year-old Brazilians head look like the surface of his brain . Two Brazilian doctors studied the un-named man's condition - a rare one known as 'cutis verticis gyrata' - and reported no other symptoms affecting the man. While he is described as a 'intellectually impaired', he does not have any psychiatric or neurological conditions and his poor performance at school is not said to be linked to his scalp condition. Instead the condition is benign, if bizarre, and affects him only cosmetically - in fact, the man is said to be quite proud of his condition. Dr. Karen Schons a dermatologist at the Hospital Universitario de Santa . Maria, who studied the patient, said: 'The patient did not have the habit of covering his head ... The condition . did not bother him cosmetically. 'It's a benign and essentially aesthetic condition.' Cutis verticis gyrata occurs more commonly in men, and usually develops shortly after puberty. The cause of the deformation is not known, although sometimes it does seem to correlate with brain-related disorders such as schizophrenia and seizures.

Argentina has unveiled a coin to commemorate the 30th anniversary of its invasion of the Falklands, inscribed with the year it claims Britain seized the islands. The South American nation's Central Bank will put into circulation 4.9 million of the two peso coins, which bear the dates 1833 and 1982-2012. In a statement the bank said that 1833, since when the islands have been under continuous British rule, represented the 'year of the usurpation by Great Britain'. Rewriting history: The Argentine coin commemorates the '30th anniversary of the recovery of the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and South Sandwich' Argentina claims Britain expelled a small Argentine civilian population in that year, but Britain had actually laid claim to the islands as far back as 1765 and Falklanders say it was only an illegal Argentine military garrison that was later expelled. The Central Bank said 1982-2012 was inscribed on the coins to mark the '30th anniversary of the recovery of the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and South Sandwich'. The reverse of the coin also features the crest of Unasur, the Union of South American Nations, over a map of the Falkland Islands with the two dates above and below. On the coin's outer ring, the word 'Malvinas' - the Argentine name for the islands - is written at the head with 'Causa Regional Americana' (American Regional Cause) below. The use of the coin to highlight Argentina's claim to sovereignty over the Falklands and its backing from other South American nations marks a further attempt by the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner to stoke the controversy. Controversial: The release of the coin marks the latest in a series of attempts by the government of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (left) to lay claim to the Falkland Islands. A Royal Marine is shown (right) searching an Argentine soldier after his country's surrender during the 1982 war . On the other side of the coin is a map of Argentina and Antarctica with the 'Malvinas' and other disputed islands in the middle with the words '2 pesos, Republica Argentina' and '2012' inscribed. Two pesos is worth around 25 pence. The coin was unveiled alongside a new 100 pesos note in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the death of Eva Peron, better known as Evita, the second wife of former president Juan Domingo Peron. Argentina's invasion of the Falklands in April 1982 triggered a 74-day war which cost the lives of 255 British servicemen, 649 Argentines and three Falklands citizens. The Falklands is to hold a referendum next year on its status as a British territory in a move designed to send a clear message to Argentina about the population's wishes.","Coin inscribed with dates 1833 - the 'year of the usurpation by Great Britain' - and 1982-2012 .

Tragic: Stuntman Sailendra Nath Roy, pictured on the slide before he died, suffered a heart attack after getting stuck part-way through his feat . Mr Roy, a West Bengal Police home guard, already held the Guinness world record for the farthest distance travelled on a zip wire using his hair. About 1,000 people turned out to see him try and break the record over the Teesta River in Darjeeling, which is almost 10,000ft above sea level, when the freak accident happened. Horror: A crowd of around 1,000 saw Mr Roy die as he attempted his stunt over the Teesta River in Darjeeling . Mr Roy attempted to free himself after his ponytail became caught in the wheeler and then tried to continue the crossing using only his hands. However, local media said he then suffered a massive cardiac arrest. Rescuers brought him down from the Coronation Bridge about 45 minutes later. He was taken to a nearby hospital but was declared dead on arrival. Mr Roy made headlines when he pulled a 42 tonne 'toy train' two and a half metres using only his ponytail . Onlookers said spectators had initially failed to realise Mr Roy was in trouble because of the cheers coming from the crowd. The stuntman had held several Guinness world records for pulling vehicles with his hair. He attracted global attention last year when he dragged a 42-tonne train for 2.5metres. In 2011, he travelled 270ft on a zip wire, which he was attached to by his hair. Siliguri police commissioner K. Jairaman said Roy had not acquired the necessary permission for the stunt, adding that Roy was not on duty at the time of his death.","Sailendra Nath Roy, 50, was trying to cross Teesta River, in Darjeeling .

The Archbishop of York is suffering from an advanced form of prostate cancer, he disclosed yesterday. Dr John Sentamu, 63, said he had undergone surgery, adding: ‘I will be out of action for some time.’ His absence from the ruling councils of the Church of England means the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Justin Welby, will be without the support of the number two in the Church’s hierarchy at a crucial time. The Anglican hierarchy is currently trying to negotiate its way through deep turmoil over same-sex marriage law and its leaders’ efforts to secure the promotion of women bishops. It was not previously known that the archbishop had cancer. In a statement, Dr Sentamu said: ‘I am thankful and grateful for Mr Bill Cross, and his surgical team at St James’s Hospital, Leeds, who today operated on me for a locally-advanced cancer of the prostate. ‘I am also grateful to the nursing staff who are caring from me. I am thankful, too, for all of you who regularly pray for me and support me, especially my staff at Bishopthorpe Palace. ‘I will be out of action for some time and will continue to value your prayers. I look forward to resuming my ministry as soon as possible.’ In 2011 Dr Sentamu spent nearly two weeks in St Thomas’ Hospital in London after suffering complications following an operation to remove his appendix. Ugandan-born Dr Sentamu, who came to Britain after opposing the regime of dictator Idi Amin in his home country, has combined fierce criticism of racism with stern opposition to the influence of left-wing multiculturalism and secular attacks on Christian institutions such as Christmas.

With you there is light, you do not forget me. With you there is hope and patience.

The sleepy Welsh village of Llangynwyd was stunned on Saturday when the woman vying to be the next U.S. First Lady dropped in for a traditional pub lunch. Taking time off from helping husband Mitt get to the White House, Ann Romney called in to 850-year-old pub, the Old House, searching for long-lost relatives and promoting her rags-to-riches story as the granddaughter of a Welsh coalminer. Mrs Romney's grandfather, David Davies, is from the nearby village of Nantyffyllon in Wales and emigrated to America in the 1920s after being crushed in a mining accident. Welsh roots: Ann Romney, pictured at a local cemetery, spent Saturday in the small village of Llangynwyd, Wales, near where her grandfather is from . 'It is very good to be here and see the village that my grandfather would have known so well,' said Ms Romney, who spent the afternoon chatting with villagers and visiting graves at the local churchyard. 'Everyone has been very nice to me. I enjoyed seeing the pub and the church so much.' With her rags-to-riches story as a coalminer's granddaughter, Ann . Romney has been cast in the campaign as the epitome of the American . dream and an inspiration to the U.S. electorate. Both Ann and Mitt regularly refer to Davies' struggles in an effort to connect with voters and dispel claims that the Republican candidate for president is out of touch with ordinary Americans. Welsh pub: Mrs Romney had a traditional Welsh lunch at 850-year-old pub The Old House, pictured . Meeting the locals: Ann Romney, pictured, plays with little Amelia Stephens-David, daughter of the owner of the Old House Pub in Llangynwyd, Richard Stephens-David . Mrs Romney has also treated . campaigners and journalists to Welsh cakes while on the campaign trail, . apparently from her grandmother's recipe. The mother-of-five's trip to explore her British roots was filmed by an NBC camera crew and will be broadcast by TV station soon. Davies worked at Welsh coalmine, Coegnant Colliery, before moving to Detroit to work in the car industry in 1929. He was later joined by his wife, Annie, and his three sons including, Edward, 15, who was Mrs Romney's father. In his new home, Edward Davies went to college, founded a business and working on the Nasa space programme. Founding grandfather: Ann Romney's grandfather David Davies, pictured here with his son Leslie, emigrated to the U.S. from Wales in 1929 after falling on hard times due to an industrial accident . Heritage: Mrs Romney's grandfather came from a village nearby Llangynwyd, pictured . The would-be First Lady was dished up . traditional Welsh fare at the centuries-old pub, which had just a week . to prepare for the visit after being given security clearance by US . officials. She . ate Welsh rarebit, which is essentially grilled cheese, rack of lamb, . wild mushroom and pea risotto and a selection of Welsh cheeses. Mrs . Romney chatted with locals including the village’s oldest resident . Jenny Williams, 79, as she searched for information about her Welsh . heritage. 'She has been . great and was glad to chat with everyone,' said Richard Stephens-David, . landlord of The Old House, whose former patrons include Richard Burton, . Elizabeth Taylor and David Bowie. On the campaign trail: Ann Romney's 'working class' story is seen as the epitome of the American Dream and could help her husband overcome his negative 'elitist' media image . American Dream: Mitt Romney with his family and wife Ann. Her ancestry lies in South Wales and her story is becoming an increasing part of Romney's campaign for a presidential nomination . 'It was a very successful day for us . and the whole valley really. To have someone who could be the most . important woman in the world in eight months time is fantastic.' Mrs . Romney was also shown around St Cynwyd’s Church in the village and laid . flowers on the graves of her relatives before being treated to a . performance from a local male voice choir. 'I . gave her a tour of the church we went out afterwards to three family . graves because she was a Davies before she married,' Vicar at St . Cynwyd’s the Rev Geraldine Blyth said. 'I . managed to find burial records of her three relatives so when she came . into the church she looked at those and I have also found copies of . those entries. She was quite touched to see the graves.'

Going back to her roots: Ann Romney's grandmother, Annie Davies, who is pictured here on a visit to Wales after emigrating to the U.S. at the turn of the 1930s . Ms Blyth added that having a famous face in town had been exciting. 'It’s good to have visitors whoever . they are but sometimes it’s nice to have someone high profile and . someone who appreciates what it is that we have,' she said. Residents were a little shocked at Mrs Romney’s visit - and by the NBC camera crew that descended on the village. 'I think it’s good she has come here,' said retired Llangynwyd man David Griffith-Williams, 73. 'It’s . a good thing for the area and a good thing for America - they could do . with a bit of cultural inspiration. It’s an important link really.' The Welsh connection: Former British Lions rugby player Roddy Evans (circled), pictured here on international duty with Wales, is Mrs Romney's second cousin . Digging for history: Mrs Romney is extremely proud of her Welsh roots, which she has passed on to her five sons who she sent down a mine on a visit to Wales so they could share their grandfather's experience . Neighbour Stuart Evans, 66, said the visit had put the village on the map.'It’s great she visited her distant relatives. It’s put the village on the map but it gives it an extra bit of profile.' While in Wales, Mrs Romney also caught up with relatives including her second cousin, former Wales and British Lions rugby player Roddy Evans. 'We remain very attached to all the family who went to America at the time,' he said. 'I’m very grateful to have them as cousins. They are very lovely people. It’s a privilege to know them and have an association with them.' Mrs Romney has been in the United Kingdom for the London Olympics, which proved a disastrous first official visit for her husband Mitt who was ridiculed by the British press for suggesting the capital was not ready to stage the sporting event. But while his wife is away, Mitt, who returned to the U.S. last week, has had to fend for himself, popping into Hunter's Shop and Save supermarket in Wolfeboro, North Hampshire, to do the grocery shopping today.

A three-year-old British boy has died while on a family holiday after he was found unconscious and floating in a hotel swimming pool. Callum Salmond was rushed to hospital from the five-star Voyage Belek resort in Turkey but was pronounced dead on Tuesday morning after several days in intensive care. The nursery pupil from Kirkcaldy, Fife, was on holiday with his mother, Donna Ness, 31, father, Graeme Salmond, 32 and 9-month-old brother Max. According to reports in the Turkish media, Callum was rescued after a British doctor who spotted him floating unconscious in one of the luxury resort's five swimming pools. The British woman doctor, who was at the poolside when Callum was in the water, rushed to try to save him. In a statement to Turkish police, the woman said she thought at first he was just playing in the water. But after looking more closely she realised the toddler was struggling in the pool. She performed CPR on him before paramedic arrived, and he was taken to hospital. Turkish National Police said Callum's mother, Donna Ness, had been attending to her nine-month-old son Max, who had 'a rash', when the tragedy occurred. Private Kemal Dincer of Belek police station, who took statements from Donna, 31, a marketing manager, and dad Graeme Salmond, 32, a garage service manager, said he was 'very sorry for what has happened'. Callum was on holiday with his parents Donna Ness and Graeme Salmond and little brother Max, when the tragic accident happened . He said: 'The family were staying in . the Voyage Belek, five star hotel and their kid, Callum, he fell in the . water in the big pool. 'A British woman saw him. She was a . doctor. She took him out the pool. She thought he was playing or . swimming but when she carefully looked then she realised he was drowning . in the water. 'She got him out the pool and did first aid, CPR. 'Donna was near the pool when it happened but she had been dealing with the little boy, Max, because he had a rash.' He added: 'Police have taken statements from the mama and papa and some other people who saw what happened. 'I am very sorry for what has happened.' The youngster was resuscitated by . paramedics who rushed him to a private hospital in the nearby town of . Belek on Turkey's south coast.

He . was later transferred to the regional Anadolu Hospital, where he clung . onto life for five days on life support following the tragic accident . last Thursday. An . investigation has now been launched into Callum's death and the exact . circumstances of how Callum had his accident remain unclear. The family had booked their break with Thomas Cook, who confirmed . yesterday that Callum had died following what they termed a 'near . drowning'. A spokeswoman said: 'I can confirm . that Callum was not found dead at the hotel and that he died after . spending several days in intensive care in hospital. He was taken to . hospital after near drowning.' Ulrich Sperl from Thomas Cook UK & . Ireland added: 'We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the . friends and family of the deceased at what must be a truly difficult . time. 'The welfare of our . customers is our top priority, and a health and safety team is . conducting a thorough investigation into the incident in collaboration . with the relevant authorities. 'Our . team in resort continue to offer every support and assistance to the . deceased's loved ones.

Holiday destination: The Voyage Belek resort in Turkey where little Callum was discovered in a pool . The . all-inclusive Voyage Belek has five swimming pools, which include a . shallow children's pool and a larger water park area with flumes and . slides. The resort boasts that it offers 'various activities' to children which are 'under the supervision of expert personnel.' Staying at the resort, for a family of four, costs in the region of £3300 for a fortnight. Parents at Strathallan Primary school in Kirkcaldy, where Callum attended nursery were issued with a letter on Tuesday morning notifying them of his death. In it, headteacher Isabelle McBain said Callum had died after a 'tragic accident'. The letter said: 'Our thoughts are with the family at this time.' One parent said: 'This is every parent's worst nightmare. 'I've no idea what happened but my thoughts are with the wee boy's family just now.' Karen Millar, chairwoman of Strathallan Primary's parent council, said: 'I know the whole school will be devastated at this news. 'Our thoughts are with Callum's family at this terribly sad time.' Michelle Selby, who runs St Brycedale playgroup in Kirkcaldy where Callum used to attend, spoke of parents shock at the death. She said: 'It's beyond a tragedy - it's every parent's worst nightmare. 'The children at the school were given a letter at the school to explain what's happened. 'He was only three, the children don't understand. 'He was a happy little soul - he moved on from playgroup and he seemed to have made friends.'

Mr Wharton has adopted a private members’ bill that has been drawn up by Tory high command because the Lib Dems refused to allow it to be presented as a government Bill. It promises a referendum by the end of 2017 following a renegotiation of Britain’s role in Brussels. Orders: The Prime Minister David Cameron has told Conservative MPs they must back a Bill on an EU referendum . The vote will force Labour and the Lib Dems to decide whether they want to publicly reject a referendum – something the Tories believe will damage them at the next general election. Privately, they believe that a number of Labour MPs who also want a referendum will break ranks with their party and support the Bill. A No 10 source said: ‘It’s difficult but it’s possible, and we’re going to give it our best shot.’ Most MPs leave Parliament on Thursdays to work in their constituencies, so votes held on Fridays are sparsely attended leaving the Bills without much chance of becoming law. But Tory whips will impose a three-line whip on the second reading of Mr Wharton’s Bill on Friday July 5, meaning they must attend. In a letter to all Conservative MPs last night, Foreign Secretary William Hague said: ‘The Party stands fully behind James’ Bill, and we will be deploying every mechanism available to us to ensure we have the best chance of getting this legislation through in the coming session – even in the face of opposition from the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats. Promise: Tory MP James Wharton's private members' bill will enshrine into law a a pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe . ‘This is an issue on which there is considerable cross-party interest, and we hope that MPs from both sides  of the House will want to support that. ‘If they do not support such a measure, then it will be clear at the next election that it is the Conservatives who are committed to giving the people a choice, with Labour and the Liberal Democrats turning their face against it.’ Leading Eurosceptic Douglas Carswell MP said: ‘It shows the party is absolutely serious about trying to get this Bill on the statute book.’ - Boris Johnson is desperate to be prime minister but would rather see David Cameron ‘fail miserably’ at the next election than stab him in the back with a leadership challenge, ex-Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson has said. Writing in GQ magazine, Mr Coulson, who will soon stand trial over allegations related to phone-hacking while editor of The News Of The World, said: ‘Boris desperately wants to be prime minister. Stabbing David in the back would be distinctly off brand – just not very Boris. ‘He would much prefer to see David fail miserably in the election and ride in on his bike to save party and country.’","Unprecedented move by Prime Minister to ensure Bill is voted through .

The global, English-language channel announced the addition to their line-up Wednesday without giving an exact premier date. ‘Politics with Larry King,’ will be the 79-year-old’s return to the television airwaves after stepping down from his 25-year run as host of CNN’s ‘Larry King Live’ in December 2010. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... He's back: Larry King, 79, has a new show set to premier in June on the Russia-based English-language cable channel RT .

Abu Qatada has complained that his taxpayer-funded house isn’t big enough for his wife and their five children. A lawyer for the Al Qaeda hate preacher, who has finally agreed to leave the country, told a court his four-bedroom home in London did not have enough storage space for all the family’s possessions. Yesterday Qatada was denied bail and told he must remain in prison. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission heard he is likely to be on a plane back to Jordan, where he faces terror charges, within weeks. Breakthrough: Abu Qatada, pictured leaving his old house, says the home the taxpayer has rented for him in North London (left) since December, which cannot be fully shown for legal reasons, is too . small . The radical cleric, once described as . Osama Bin Laden’s ‘right-hand man in Europe’, had been hauled back to . prison after a ‘serious’ breach of his bail conditions, when police . found memory sticks containing jihadist propaganda and internet-enabled . mobile phones in the property. Officers also found £5,000 in cash. The Home Office moved the family to the new home a few months ago, and . Qatada’s lawyer sought to blame his failure to keep his bail conditions . on the consequent upheaval. Couple: Abu Qatada shopping with his wife near his home five years ago. His lawyer said today she and his five children will leave Britain with him should he go . The Home Office released this image of Home Secretary Theresa May signing the fair trial guarantees with Jordan that she believes will reassure courts that torture evidence would not be used against Abu Qatada . Still smiling: Labour and Conservative ministers have been trying to deport Qatada for a decade but have failed . September 16 1993 - The Jordanian claims asylum when he arrives on a forged passport. May 1998 - He applies to stay indefinitely . April 1999 - He is convicted in his absence on terror charges in Jordan and sentenced to life imprisonment. February 2001 . - Arrested by police over involvement in a plot to . bomb Strasbourg Christmas market. Officers find him with . £170,000 in cash, including an envelope marked 'For the . mujahedin in Chechnya'. August 2005 - The preacher is arrested under immigration rules as the Government seeks to deport him to Jordan. April 2008 . - The Court of Appeal rules that deporting him would breach his human . rights because evidence used against him in Jordan may have been . obtained through torture. February 18 2009 . - Five Law Lords back the . Government's policy of removing terror suspects from Britain on the . basis of assurances from foreign governments. It is ruled he can be . deported to Jordan.April 18 2012 - Abu Qatada lodges an appeal - potentially delaying his deportation by months.

April 17 2013 - Home Office says it will take its battle to the Supreme Court. April 23 2013 - Court of Appeal rejects government request to appeal. Daniel Friedman QC told the court the breach took place ‘in the context . of the movement at short notice, no proper storage and a family under . siege and exhausted’. He said there was ‘not enough storage space in . what was in effect a three-bedroomed house’. But Mr Friedman argued Qatada should be released on bail so he could . spend time with his family ahead of their departure to Jordan. The . tribunal heard the memory stick belonging to one of Qatada’s sons . contained university coursework as well as videos ‘produced by the media . wing of Al Qaeda’. Robin Tam QC, for the Home Office, said the bail breaches amounted to a . ‘wholesale and wanton disregard by the entire family from top to bottom . of the requirements of SIAC’s order’. Mr Justice Irwin described the breaches as ‘serious’ and rejected the application. He said: ‘This appellant has in the past fled in order to avoid a court order, equipping himself with a false passport. ‘He is highly intelligent, has a range of sympathetic and supportive . contacts, and his risk to national security is undiminished. ‘We reject the submission that he can, even now, be relied on to comply . with his legal obligations and not to attempt to abscond.’ Earlier this month Qatada said he would return home voluntarily when a . treaty signed by Britain and Jordan is ratified. It will ensure evidence . from torture is not used against him at trial. Mr Friedman said the agreement meant Qatada would likely be acquitted over what he described as ‘tainted’ charges. Mr Tam said Jordan’s parliament will approve the treaty within weeks. Once approved, deportation can be signed off by Mrs May in days.","Radical cleric's wife and five children will join him in Jordan .

Four teenage gang members have been jailed for life for killing a 15-year-old . boy who was chased and stabbed to death by a 'hunting posse of boys on bicycles'. Negus McLean was repeatedly stabbed until the blade of a large knife broke away from its handle after being targeted in a 'postcode' feud between rival north London gangs, the Old Bailey heard. Billal Lariba, 18, Brandon Hamilton, 18, . Tershan Edwards, 19, and 16-year-old Travis . Bowman were yesterday found guilty of his murder. Jailed: (Clockwise from top left) Billal Lariba, 18, Brandon Hamilton, 18,  Tershan Edwards, 19, and Travis Bowman, 16 stabbed a 15 year-old schoolboy to death in the street during a 'postcode war' Judge John Bevan told them the 'ghastly' killing was 'cowardly beyond belief'. Negus was said to have been a victim of a postcode rivalry between two teenage gangs which . saw three stabbings in a week in neighbouring areas of north London. The first two victims, involving rivals from the Enfield EN3 Get Money Gang and Edmonton N9's Dem Africans group, survived. Negus McLean, 15, was the victim of a 'postcode' gang war . But Negus, a member of DA, died from his injuries following the attack by members of the GMG on April 10, 2011. The court heard that after the murder Edwards wrote a series of vile rap lyrics glorifying knife attacks which Judge Bevan described as a 'hymn to knife violence.' They included the chilling line: 'Stab a man up and then ask who's next.' Simon Denison, QC, prosecuting, said: 'A group of seven boys from the . GMG gang rode out of EN3 on bicycles, like a hunting posse, south into . N9, in order to carry out that attack.' Negus was riding his bike with some other lads when he was spotted, chased and killed. Mr Denison added: 'Negus came off his bike and he was attacked. He was . knocked to the ground and repeatedly stabbed in the chest and in his . legs. 'A metal knife that was used to stab him was driven down into him with such force that the blade snapped off the handle. 'Negus was left lying on the pavement, blood pouring from his wounds. He . lost a lot of blood very quickly and died that evening in hospital.' Negus's mother Ingrid said in a statement to the court: ""My heart is . broken. Negus died just before his 16th birthday. He did not get to . finish school. There was no prom for him. I was picking out his coffin . on his birthday.' Of her son's killers, she said: 'I am angry and hate what they have . done. It seems these young boys have no respect for life, even their . own. One day, if they become parents they will think about Negus and the . pain they have caused.' Scene: Negus died in daylight in a street of smartly restored Victorian terrace houses . The judge lifted a court order banning the identification of the 16 . year-old as Travis Bowman, from Ashton Road, Enfield, and the 17 . year-old girl Yasmin Latif, who gave Hamilton a false alibi. Bowman, who was only 14 at the time of the murder, came to the UK . because of his family's problems with gang violence in Jamaica, the . court heard. GMG all day brudda that's the set, when you come thru my hood better . show some respect, . Or my little Youngaz will push a blade thru your . neck . Stab a man up and then ask who's next. When I ride out no gun just my samuri, I'll chop him his head until he . f****** dies . they stabbed me up once but they can't stab me f****** . twice . Ima stab him in the back and leave him f****** paralised.' All four were sentenced to detention at Her Majesty's Pleasure. Hamilton . will serve at least 19 years before parole, Lariba 16 and a half years, . Edwards 17 years and Bowman 12 and a half years. Latif was sentenced to 12 months detention and training order. Judge Bevan  said: 'It seems to occur to none of the perpetrators . that an attack by seven or eight armed and masked on one is cowardly . beyond belief. 'You feel able to operate in some sort of parallel universe in which . robbery, theft, drugs and violence are acceptable, unless a member of . you gang is the victim, in which case retaliation is necessary to . preserve status and what is laughably called respect. 'This is all because of loyalty to a postcode. It simply creates a . vicious circle of anger, misery and death. Lack of moral values lie at . the heart of it and the picture painted before the jury over the last . six weeks has been infinitely depressing.' Lariba and Hamilton, both of Enfield, north London, Edwards, of St Albans, Hertfordshire, and . Bowman, of Enfield, shouted as they left the dock to begin their sentence.","Negus McLean was stabbed until the knife blade broke away from its handle .

Animal rights activists are poised to sabotage the controversial cull of thousands of badgers which is set to begin tonight. More than 5,000 badgers will be shot in west Gloucestershire and west Somerset over a six-week period in an attempt stop the spread of TB among cattle. Badgers are blamed for spreading the disease to livestock, devastating herds and costing dairy farmers and the taxpayer millions of pounds a year. Controversial: A cull of thousands of badgers in several UK counties will begin tonight to stop the spread of TB to cows . Cull: Gloucestershire is one of the counties where some 5,000 badgers will be shot over a six week period . Ministers say that unless everything possible is done to control the disease, the bill to the country will top £1billion over the next decade. But critics favour other methods, including vaccination, and say that the science behind the cull is not sound. They warn that many animals will die a slow, painful death, after being maimed, rather than killed outright and say that studies have shown that killing badgers can actually foster the spread of the disease, rather than control it. Rock star Brian May has helped raise the opposition’s profile and will today lead a march against the ‘pointless slaughter’. More extreme groups have pledged to sabotage the cull by using techniques from making noise to scare the badgers away to putting marksmen under citizen’s arrest. Famous opposition: Queen guitarist Brian May will today lead a protest against the cull - he is pictured on a similar protest last autumn . Under the terms of the licenses for the culls, at least 70 per cent of the badgers must be killed during a six-week period between now and the start of February. The culling period is concentrated in this way to try to prevent the disease being spread by infected creatures fleeing into surrounding areas. The animals will be shot in fields by trained marksmen or killed after being caught in baited traps. No advance warning will be given of the start of the cull.  Some speculate it won’t start until crops are harvested and the tourist season is over.  The alternative view is that an early start would stop tension from building further and deprive activists of preparation time. Long-term, the strategy could cut the amount of TB in the area by 16 per cent. The two pilot schemes are designed to show that the widespread shooting of badgers is safe and humane, as well as feasible. Protest: An unknown animal-loving graffiti artist has hand drawn a graphic image of a rotting dead badger on a derelict building in Sidlesham, West Sussex, in protest of the badger culling . If successful, it could be extended to other bovine TB hotpots. A cattle vaccine is a decade away and while a jab for badgers exists, its administration is hugely time-intensive as each animal has to be caught and immunised individually. Taking aim: The animals will be shot in fields by trained marksmen or killed after being caught in baited traps . Farming minister David Heath told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘All the countries that have successfully dealt with this disease have employed a policy similar to ours. ‘What we’re trying to see in these pilot culls is whether it can be done humanely, safely and efficiently. ‘If we have a comprehensive strategy we might be able to deal with this devastating disease.’ The National Farmers’ Unions says that with the number of cases of bovine TB exploding in recent years, a cull is the only option. Shadow environment minister Mary Creagh described the cull as ‘an untested and risky approach’. She added: ‘The policing costs, paid by the taxpayer, will balloon to £4million while bovine TB will increase over the next two years as the shooting displaces badgers.’ Philip Mansbridge, chief executive of the charity Care for the Wild, said: ‘The Government and the NFU are blindly embarking on one of the worst agricultural policies of the last 30 years, which will lead to senseless slaughter, chaos and disruption in the countryside, huge cost to the taxpayer and no meaningful reduction in the spread of bovine TB.’ The Hunt Saboteurs Organisation said it has already surveyed the cull site and has people in the area. More will be brought in as needed. Spokesman Lee Moon said the group will use bright lights and whistles to scare the badgers away but, if necessary, members will ‘stand in front of the guns’. The cull will be discussed in Parliament on Wednesday at a debate called by Labour.","More than 5,000 badgers will be shot over a six week period .
