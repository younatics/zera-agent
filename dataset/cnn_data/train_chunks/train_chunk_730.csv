Julian Fellowes is sure to alarm fans of Downton Abbey as he suggests the latest series may be its final. The screenwriter has been commissioned to create what has been dubbed the American version of of the ITV1 show, but plans have been put on hold. 'It will happen when Downton finishes, because I just couldn't do both at once... I don't know yet if there is a season six, but it's not going to go on forever,' he said. Julian Fellowes can't get started on his latest project while working on Downton Abbey . The period drama made its debut in 2010, telling story of the aristocratic Crawley family. It is set to return to screens later this year for its fifth series. But Fellowes' latest bombshell which hints at Downton's possible demise will not come as good news to ITV1 executives. The show has been one of the channel's biggest hits in recent years. The screenwriter admits there is no way he could continue to write it while working on his next major project, The Gilded Age, for which he was commissioned almost a year ago by American TV network NB . Production is currently being held up by Fellowes's commitment to Downton, he reveals in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal. Downton Abbey will return for a fifth series later this year - but Fellowes has suggested it may be its last . 'I haven't written [The Gilded Age] yet' he confesses. 'But it's about the old aristocracy, the Winthrops and the Stuyvesants and the new money of oil and gas and shipping in the 1870s. It will all be fiction – it won't be real people – but when those families descended on New York, they took over.' Fellowes previously said of The Gilded Age that it will chart 'the dizzying, brilliant ascents and calamitous falls' of New York society in late 19th century. It is being billed by NBC as ‘an epic tale of the princes of the American Renaissance and the vast fortunes made - and spent - in late 19th- century New York’. 'This was a vivid time in America,' said Fellowes. 'There was record-breaking ostentation and savage rivalry, in a time when money was king.' It had been suggested that Fellowes could hand over the main Downton writing responsibilities to others while he embarks on the American show. But in his latest interview he suggests that is out of the question, revealing that he writes alone, bouncing ideas only off his wife. Meanwhile, ITV tell MailOnline: 'No decision has been made on when Downton Abbey will end'.","Lord Fellowes, creator of ITV1 show, may end Downton soon .

'I'd been big for most of my life and planning my wedding was another painful reminder,' said Valerie, an IT manager. 'The fat little cake topper' that prompted Valerie McLean to lose weight . 'The fat little cake topper just summed me up. 'I even grew between picking my wedding dress and picking it up. I was a size 16, but by the time I got the dress I'd become a size 18. 'I just couldn't get into it and burst into tears. I didn't realise I'd let my weight get so bad and thought I would look back on my wedding photographs in shame.'

A stroke survivor is learning to walk again with the help of a revolutionary robotic leg - which predicts her movements. Sue Sandars, 51, lost nearly all the use of her left arm and leg following a blood clot in her brain. But thanks to the new leg - and hours of hard work - she is hoping to get rid of her wheelchair for good. Scroll down for video . Mobile: Sue Sandars lost nearly all the use of her left arm and leg following a blood clot in her brain. She is now learning to walk again with the help of a revolutionary robotic leg which predicts her movements . One of just two in the UK, the thigh-high device is controlled by a super-sensitive insole in her trainer which decodes her intended manoeuvre through tiny initial movements. The £30,000 gadget then instantly moves - as if reading her mind - doing some of the work needed to help the wearer walk or stand up. It helps the mother-of-two build up her muscles and also retrains the parts of her brain which were damaged when she had her stroke. Mrs Sandars, of Blockley, Gloucestershire, said: 'The leg is amazing. There are little electrodes that go in the insole in my trainer and when I start to move just a tiny bit it stimulates the bionic leg to move, taking away some of the effort needed to walk or stand. 'It reacts to what I do, almost calibrating how much effort I am doing myself. I’ve only been using it for two or three months but I can notice the difference already. Unique: Mrs Sandards has one of just two of the devices available in the UK. The thigh-high device is controlled by a super-sensitive insole in her trainer which decodes her intended manoeuvre through tiny initial movements . 'My mantra in life is that I kissed death and now I’m hugging life. If I didn’t have that determination I would never be where I am now.' Unaware she was experiencing tell-tale signs of a stroke, Mrs Sandars had trouble typing on her keyboard the day before her clot fully formed in July 2010. She put it down to a migraine and took painkillers before driving home, making dinner and heading to bed. But when she woke up at 2am to go to the bathroom, she smacked her head off the shower door. Sue said: 'My head was banging against the shower cubicle and my husband woke up and came into see me and realised that my face was dropping. Moving: The £30,000 gadget then instantly moves - as if reading the wearer's mind - doing some of the work needed to help them walk or stand up. It also helps them retrain the parts of the brain which are damaged during the stroke . 'His father had a stroke so he knew what he was looking at. 'He rang 999 and I could hear him saying I was having a stroke. I remember thinking ""that can’t be right - I’m 48, only old people have strokes, how the hell can that be happening to me?’""' Mrs Sandars slipped in and out of consciousness for three days after she was rushed to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Progress: Mrs Sandars is hoping to get rid of her wheelchair soon . She was transferred to a specialist rehabilitation unit in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, after two weeks, where she spent four months regaining some use of her arm and leg. Mrs Sandars - who uses a stick and a wheelchair - has been using the bionic leg at The Gym in Cheltenham for three months. It has been loaned to personal trainer Dan Fivey by U.S. inventors AlterG, who are keen to get UK feedback on their newest invention. Mr Fivey said: 'It helps people walk further, faster and for longer and gives them the confidence and self esteem that they can do it without the bionic leg. 'They can do activities like squatting, cross training and walking, standing up and sitting down, without falling over and without their walking aids. 'When they have been walking for ten to 15 minutes with the leg on, when we take the leg off the muscles as switched on. 'They are ready to go doing that activity again and the brain sort of remembers that muscles needed and how to work without the leg on.' Mrs Sandars, who returned to work in telesales in January, added: 'I can feel the difference already. I’m determined. I’m going to be out of that wheelchair for good sooner or later.'","Sue Sandars lost nearly all the use of her left arm and leg following stroke .

Wanted: Lee Willis, 30, was detained by Greater Manchester Police on New Year's Day after going on the run last year . One of Britain's most-wanted criminals, who was thought to be hiding in Spain, has been arrested in Bolton. Lee Willis, 30, was detained by Greater Manchester Police on New Year's Day, the force said today. He had admitted possessing cocaine and cannabis in March last year but went on the run before he was due to be sentenced in June. Willis also stands accused of dealing the class A drug. Willis, from Ashton-under-Lyne, was highlighted on a list issued by the charity Crimestoppers, the UK's National Crime Agency and Spanish police in Madrid last year as one of 13 of Britain's most-wanted fugitives. The list was published as part of Operation Captura, a scheme to trace criminals who were believed to have fled to Spain. Willis is due to appear in court later this month, Greater Manchester Police said. The fugitives are wanted for crimes including, attempted murder, sexual offences against children and class A drug dealing. The 'unlucky 13,' as they have been dubbed by the National Crime Agency, Crimestoppers, and Spanish police, are thought to view Spain as a 'safe haven'. The full 13 have been named by authorities and include a man who has been convicted of a heroin distribution offence and is still awaiting sentencing. Police say Stephen Blundell, from Liverpool, was 'the principle organiser of his own heroin supply chain', often arranging for the drug to be shipped from Liverpool to Devon. Also from Liverpool is David Hewson, who has been found guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine and despite his absence was sentenced to 11 years in prison. He remains on the run. Michael McCartney, 78, from Hertfordshire, was found guilty of nine counts of indecent assault and another of child sex abuse, namely on three boys over a number of a years. Criminals are thought to view Spain - and in particular the Costa del Sol - as a 'safe haven'. Pictured here is Marbella . Collaboration between UK and Spanish authorities is said to be key in tracing the criminals and both are appealing for diligence in the public to report sightings. Lord Ashcroft, founder of Crimestoppers, said: 'The fact we are able to once again launch Operation Captura is an indication of how successful the last seven years have been since its inception. 'However despite our success so far, there are still a number of dangerous criminals who see Spain as a safe haven to hide from their past, but with the support of the Spanish and UK public, we can hunt them out and bring them to justice.'","Lee Willis detained by Greater Manchester Police on New Year's Day .

Britney Spears and Simon Cowell admit to having had cosmetic surgery to help fight the signs of ageing. And it seems that vain Brits are following their lead, with 2014 set to see a huge surge in treatments. A new survey has analysed what will prove to be the most popular procedures in the coming year and according to the results lipotripsy, chinplants and vaginoplasty look set to take the cosmetic world by storm. Scroll down for video . Hot for 2014: A new study has delved into the cosmetic surgery trends of this year and predicted what will be big news for next year . Women will continue to aspire to capture Hollywood glamour and opt to have chin implants - a procedure recently revealed to have been undertaken by movie starlet, Marilyn Monroe. The procedure, which claims to add definition and balance facial features, has seen enquiries double since 2010 and clinics expect the desire for a striking and defined chin to continue far into 2014. There will also be huge demand for more intimate treatments as the quest for a ‘designer vagina’ intensifies, with labiaplasty and vaginoplasty amongst the UK’s fastest growing cosmetic surgery procedures. Labiaplasty is a surgical procedure to reduce the size of, or reshape, the labia minora (inner vagina lips) either for medical or aesthetic reasons. Vaginoplasty ‘tightens’ the vagina and is a procedure that is particularly popular among women who have given birth. Celebrity inspired: Following on from the likes of Kim Kardashian (L) and Coleen Rooney (R), non-surgical treatments are the ones to watch, claim experts . The clinic reports that enquiries for the procedures have grown from 2,400 in 2010 to over 3,500 in 2013. 'Such . results suggest that more and more women will feel empowered to undergo . a vaginoplasty procedure in the coming year - and this is certainly set . to be the surgery on everyone’s lips in 2014,' said a spokesperson for . Transform Cosmetic Surgery, who carried out the research. While . many people will go under the knife in their quest for ageless skin, . others will opt for non-surgical treatments, which account for 75 per . cent of the cosmetic industry. Following on from the likes of Kim Kardashian, Coleen Rooney and Sharon Osbourne, these treatments are the ones to watch, claim experts. Pain-free: Non surgical face lifts are set to be big news next year as people strive for more radiant skin without the pain and recovery time . Anti-ageing treatments such as dermal fillers, Botox and chemical facial peels are fast becoming a must on beauty-lovers’ lists. Combined, they claim to provide the ideal 'face-lift' that is seen to be taking over the surgical face-lift by restoring the contour of the face without the need for any surgery. Mesotherapy - a treatment of . micro-injections on the mesoderm (the middle layer of the skin) containing collagen-stimulating vitamins to reduce the signs of ageing - will also hit the mainstream, predict experts. Copy cats: Women will continue to aspire to capture Hollywood glamour and opt to have chin implants - a procedure recently revealed to have been undertaken by movie starlet, Marilyn Monroe . As for non-surgical body treatments, Lipotripsy - a non-invasive, pain-fee treatment that works by stimulating the fat breakdown, collagen synthesis and lymphatic drainage - looks set to be big news. Lipotripsy claims to treat the arms, saddlebags, thighs, hips, love handles and abdomen by increasing oxygen levels and improving the skin's elasticity and smoothness. The research also suggests that the . allure of boobs - whether to have them bigger, smaller or more pert - . will continue to be one of the most popular cosmetic procedures in the . UK. A spokesperson for Transform Cosmetic Surgery said: 'There is a growing awareness of the different types of surgery available to people, coupled with the increasing desire to look and feel at your best. 'Patients come to us as they want to feel good about their bodies and surgery can help them, and ultimately improve their self-confidence. 'Whilst surgical procedures are still very popular, it’s the non-surgical procedures that are proving to be a key theme and this trend is set to continue into 2014 and beyond.'","Enquiries for chinplants have doubled since 2010 .

Sophie Ellis-Bextor, pictured at an awards ceremony, says girls are encouraged to flaunt their sexuality .

Speaking to the Telegraph's Seven magazine, she says that while she doesn't feel she should comment on what anyone else are up to, she has noticed a difference in pop stars' attitudes now compared to the 1990s. 'There were as many debates about Madonna . then as there are about Miley Cyrus now. But Madonna always seemed to . be in control of what she was doing... 'For me, the reason things get debated is because the context or intention is not owned in the right way by whoever's doing it...

The signer says there were as many debates about Madonna then as there are about Miley Cyrus now. But Madonna 'seemed to be in control' Sophie admits that getting pregnant within weeks of meeting Richard came as a huge shock, but it was her mother, Blue Peter presenter Janet Ellis, who promised her everything would turn out for the best. 'I don't think you could ever be confident that it would work out OK. But mum said to me, ""It might not be the right time, it might not be the right man, but it's the right baby,"" she said in a recent interview. Not long after giving birth to her first child, Sophie decided to commemorate the huge moment in her life with a large heart tattoo on her arm, which she's been showing off in recent weeks. Sophie, who frequently flaunts her 'Family' tattoo, has three sons under 10 with her husband Richard . The singer admits that she received a lot of Twitter hate over the statement ink though.

A nurse who cared for a reclusive heiress for 20 years before she died leaving $300million is suing her estate for a slice of her fortune. Geraldine Coffey earned $130,000 a year looking after copper heiress Huguette Clark and received £1million in gifts from her over her lifetime. But the night nurse, who says Clark promised to 'provide for her', is now reportedly suing her late boss's estate after receiving nothing in Clark's will. Fortune: Huguette Clark left $300million, which is now being fought over by her former night nurse . Mrs Coffey, who looked after the reclusive Clark until she died aged 104 in 2011, says she was left out of wranglings last autumn over two wills written by the wealthy woman in 2005 when she was 99. Her legacy left millions to former members of staff and philanthropic organisations, rather than her distant family members, many of whom she had never met, but who are battling for a share of the cash. Clark's former employees say they were given gifts by their employer, and last September a deal was agreed between many of them and the heiress' estate and relatives. In the deal, . Clark's lawyer, Wallace Bock, and accountant, Irving Kamsler, were cut . out of $1million gifts in exchange for a promise that they would not be . involved in any future litigation. But Irish immigrant Mrs Coffey says she was left out of negotiations and thus received nothing. Meanwhile lawyers for the estate are accusing night nurse Mrs Coffey of causing Clark 'anxiety and distress' by nagging her to give her a $7.5million apartment, it was reported, and of putting her own needs before her elderly patient's. Life of luxury: Mrs Clark lived in a 42-room apartment in this smart block in Manhattan . John Morken, attorney for Clark's relatives and for the heiress' estate, said Ms Coffey put pressure on Clark to give her money, the New York Post reported. In . court papers he alleges: 'While purportedly caring for Clark, . Geraldine repeatedly pressured her patient to make ""gifts"" to and for . the benefit of her family.' Morken added: 'At the time Mrs Clark was reported in nurse's notes to be ""confused during the night"" and ""delusional"". But Ms Coffey, who is being sued to return gifts said to include $385,000 to buy real estate in New York and $85,000 for school fees for her children, is reportedly refusing to sign off the deal. Wealthy family: Huguette Clark, right, with her father, William, and older sister, Andree, pictured in 1917 . She denies the allegations, claiming that Bock and Kamsler were heavily involved in the allegations that she pressured Clark to hand over some of her fortune. Coffey worked 12-hour days for Mrs Clark, the childless daughter of senator and industrialist William A Clark, who made a fortune in mining and railroads. Mrs Clark lived alone in a 42-room Manhattan apartment with only her extensive collection of dolls and a nurse for company. She was said to only leave her apartment to attend Christian Dior fashion shows in order to find new dresses for her dolls.

It may look like a tranquil walk across a beautiful lake, but for one daredevil climber and sportsman this was no country stroll. In stark contrast to the perfectly clam waters of Green Lake, Austria, extreme sport champion Mich Kemeter struggled to stay focused as he edged along 250m of slackline. But after 35 attempts the Austrian-born adventurer finally made it to the other end, breaking his own world record for 'waterlining'. Scroll down for video . Mich Kemeter, 24, walked 250m - the same distance as three football fields  - across Lake Green in Austria, beating his previous record of 222m . The record attempt took 20 days to complete including one time which saw Mich make it to within just 6 metres of the finish before he lost his balance . To complete the walk Mich had to hold his arms horizontal for up to half and hour at a time, causing him agony as his muscles burned in pain . The challenge he set himself, to walk the length of three football pitches suspended only by a strip of canvas, tested his mental and physical capabilities to the limits. Holding his arms in a horizontal position for half an hour at a time put the athlete in intense pain as his shoulder and bicep muscles started burning. He also had to stay focused on the other end of the line for balance, while knowing that at any second a slight gust of wind could send him tumbling. On one attempt he made it to within 6 meters of the finish before losing his balance and falling into the water. Easy does it: Mich said the biggest problems were wind and weather conditions which had to be perfect to stand a chance of completing the walk . Serene: Mich said that while on the line he felt connected with nature in the fantastic setting in Austria, near to where he grew up . Extreme: Mich (pictured far right) is also a world renowned free solo climber and basejumper who has climbed a 1000ft sheer cliff with no safety harness . But eventually, 20 days after his first attempt and watched along by family and sports enthusiasts, Mich finally reached the other side. He said: 'It is an incredible feeling to break your own record. The . biggest issue is the wind and the weather conditions - you have to wait . to make it as perfect as possible for the actual walk.

What is essentially a glorified sock has helped boost the net income of the world’s largest athletic clothing company by nearly 40per cent. Nike’s Flyknit sneaker, which uses knitted fibers to create a lightweight, durable, and incredibly attractive shoe, is one of the main contributors to the brand’s steady sales increases and progress on the stock market, Bloomberg says. At $160, the Eco-conscious shoe is among one of Nike’s most expensive product offerings in the women’s footwear category. Scroll down for video . Lucrative business: Nike's $160 Flyknit sneaker accounts for a 40per cent increased income for the brand . Thread technology: Flyknits use durable woven threads to create a sock-like experience . The Flyknit’s success represents Nike’s push towards higher-priced shoes, which financial analysts have labeled as an equally successful plot. Additional styles like the woven Inneva ($200) sneaker have helped raise the brand’s aesthetic profile even further. But those designs have not registered the same kind of fanfare as the coveted Flyknit- which is now offered in a large variety of colorways. Nike has even adapted Flyknit technology for its sturdier Flyknit Lunar running shoe, and has used Flyknit threads in a winterized sneaker that will be worn by medal-winning U.S. Olympians on the podium in Sochi. In the athletics division, Nike’s $225 Hypervenom soccer cleats have proven an equal success to the Flyknit's street appeal, Bloomberg says. Decreased raw material costs have helped widen the brand’s profit margins on the already higher-priced merchandise. Reinterpreted: The brand adapted its Flyknit threads for a winterized sneaker that U.S. medal-winning Olympians will wear on the podium in Sochi . Jay Sole, an analyst for Morgan Stanley, . told Bloomberg that ‘the growing global health and wellness trend plus . strong product innovations are driving Nike’s business.’ The shoe's one-piece upper portion is constructed of polyester fibers that are woven more tightly in areas of the foot that require additional support. Research for the Flyknit sneaker began in 2002 when Nike product developers realized that athletes at Stanford University were training barefoot. Nike says that the result is a . lightweight, 'second-skin' experience that creates little-to-none . environmental waste in its production thanks to its specially-designed . knitting machines. Cowen & Co. analyst Faye Landes, chimed in on Nike for MarketWatch saying . that ‘Nike’s cool factor is highest among adults 18-24, and . significantly higher among non-whites than whites, both boding extremely . well for Nike long-term.’ [sic] . The brand reported last week that its quarterly sales had increased by 8per cent to $6.43 billion. Nike stocks recently hit an all-time high of $80 per share – though some analysts appear skeptical of the brand’s capability for further market growth. Nike representatives have attributed the label’s rising success to not only more expensive goods, but its growing foothold in e-commerce as well. Nike’s online sales have risen 33per cent in the last year, they say, and represent at least 15per cent of the company’s overall revenue. For this reason, Nike has rejigged its line of Internet-reliant ‘Fuelbands,’ with a more modern appearance.

Third-grade teacher Jennifer Doan lost seven students in her class the day an EF5 tornado ripped through Moore, Oklahoma last May, completely destroying the storm shelter-less Plaza Heights Elementary School. The 31-year-old was eight months pregnant when she was pulled from the rubble of the destroyed school, and at the time she figured the trauma would cause her to lose her child. But on December 21, Doan and her husband Nyle Rodgers welcomed a new son into the world and chose to name him after one of her students that didn't survive. Namesake: Jennifer Doan (left)  was eight weeks pregnant when she survived a tornado that hit Moore, Oklahoma last May. She gave birth to her son last month and named him after one of the students she lost when the school collapsed - 9-year-old Nicholas McCabe (right) When the tornado got closer, Doan grabbed as many of her students as possible to huddle together. While the other students continued to squirm and talk, 9-year-old Nicholas McCabe became exceptionally still when Doan put her hand on him. 'He was the one closest to me that didn't make it,' she told NewsOK. I had my hand on him. He's been a little hard to let go.' Nicolas was one of seven children who died after being crushed by a water line. Doan and her husband chose to memorialize Nicolas by giving their new son jack the middle name of Nicolas. Nicolas's mother Stacey McCabe was touched by the namesake for her son who loved going to the lake, playing with legos and listening to country music. Rescued: In a now famous image, Doan was rescued from the rubble of Plaza Towers elementary school when she was already eight week pregnant . The old Plaza Towers elementary school was completely destroyed in the tornado and didn't have any storm shelters. It is currently being rebuilt and the new school will have these protections . Eyes of the nation: President Obama speaks outside the rubble of Plaza Towers elementary school following the traumatic tornado . For Doan, she remembers Nicolas' smile the most. New hope: Doan and her husband welcomed baby Jack late last month. She has two other daughters, 6 and 3 . 'He would get in trouble over some little thing and just flash me this big smile to get out of it. He just had one of those smiles,' she said. After the tornado, Doan spent time in the hospital recovering from a broken back and sternum, strained neck, and lacerated tendons in her hand. A psychologist recommended that she not be told which of her students had died for two days, and when she was finally informed her shrieks could be heard down the hallway. She took no pain medication for her injuries since she didn't want to hurt her baby, and wore a back brace for six weeks while pregnant. And she's still recovering from the . emotional injuries. Doan says she sees a psychologist once a week, and . is having a hard time dealing with her survivor's guilt, constantly . asking why she lived when innocent children died. While baby Jack gives her new hope and a reason to go on, he's also a reminder of the trauma of that deadly day. 'Just looking at him, it reminds me of that day, and the ones that I did lose.' But she does want to return to teaching at Plaza Towers, which is currently being rebuilt with storm shelters. 'There's a lot of me in Plaza Towers. I know it's going to be difficult. I'm hoping it will bring some peace and some healing. Doan is also mother to two daughters, Kairi, 6, and Kylie, 3.

Researchers suggest that being close to others with similar personality traits goes back millions of years. They found the phenomenon occurs not only in people but also in chimpanzees. This indicates its origins date to when humans and the apes had a similar evolutionary path before going their separate ways. Good friends: An alpha male chimpanzee and his brother in a tropical forest in western Uganda . The last common ancestor of chimps and humans lived at least six million years ago, indicating the first ‘best friends’ walked the Earth all that time ago, said Austrian and Swiss researchers. They studied colonies of chimpanzees in two Dutch zoos and firstly rated their personality traits. Sociability was measured by physical proximity, for example how often individuals were within 6ft of another chimp. The frequency of grooming, in which the apes remove dirt and parasites from each other, was also crucial as it builds bonds. Then, to work out which chimps were friends, they examined how often one sat or lay in physical contact with another. This could include sitting side by side, back to back or resting a whole leg or arm on another ape – all signs of friendship. Analysis revealed the closest friends had similar characters. The researchers said: ‘Chimps of a feather sit together.’ Jorg Massen, of the University of Vienna, said: ‘The most sociable and bold individuals preferred the company of other highly sociable and bold individuals. The shy and less sociable ones spent time with other similarly aloof and shy chimpanzees.’ In the US journal Evolution of Human Behavior, he added: ‘What draws both chimpanzee and human friends together is similarity in gregariousness and boldness, suggesting that preference for self-like friends dates back to our last common ancestor.’ He added that teaming up with someone of similar character can help build trust, while friendships between daring chimps would help when trying to fight off predators.","Study finds that chimps, like people, form close friendships .

Frog (wrong, dropped back to £50,000) The Scot admitted to Chris Tarrant before the questions started that he was still sore at only winning £32,000 last time. 'I was devastated,' he told Tarrant. 'We looked great at £64k, three lifelines, but we couldn't do it.' He also admitted to being a quiz fan, with the Ferguson family regularly taking part in family quizzes at Christmas. 'It's very competitive. We get one of the grandson's to do the questions.' Ferguson and Holmes had a strong start . rattling through the first few questions to get to £10,000 in no time. However, they did have to burn a lifeline on the fourth question, as . they didn't know what the recent increase in minimum wage for over 21s . had changed to. They asked the audience and went with the 83 per cent majority, who answered correctly, saying £6.31. The . pair ran into a bit more trouble thereafter, however. They confidently . answered that Delia Smith had sold the record amount of cookbooks in the . UK, but on their next two questions they used a further two lifelines. The . £20,000 question asked: 'Margaret Thatcher regularly had a 'Carmen' listed in her daily diary, indicating an appointment with her what?' They had to ring Jon Lawrence, a . journalist at the Daily Telegraph, who said the answer was her . hairdresser, although he 'wasn't sure'. That . was correct and so was the answer to the next question, which asked . what was the most common surname in the UK since records began. Out of Jones, Taylor, Smith and Brown, they beleived it was either Jones or Smith but decided to use their 50/50. Easy: The first question raised a smile from Fergie, and both answered it quickly . Secret fan? Ferguson also knew the answer to question two, about the recent X-Factor show . That's not fair: The pair were even asked a football question . Slightly tougher: Ferguson and Holmes didn't know that the minimum wage had been increased to (B) £6.31 . Delia fan: The former Manchester United boss knew that Delia Smith had sold a record number of books . Phone a friend: The duo had to ask a journalist to give them the answer to the question about Margaret Thatcher . 50/50: Answering this question correctly meant they were guaranteed to win at least £50,000 . No answer: They had to use their switch lifeline to get out of answering this toughie . This didn't help as it brought up the two names they had conferred over. However, they eventually went with Smith, which took them to the total of £50,000, an amount that became their new minimum and added a lifeline, the switch, which allows for a change in question. They had to use it on their next go, not knowing that an Octopus has three hearts. The next question seemed equally tough, asking about December tax laws in Europe. Delight: Their guess of Norway took Ferguson and Holmes up to £75,000 - Chris Tarrant was also delighted . Walking away: Sir Alex and Eamonn Holmes leave the stage after bagging £50,000 . Ferguson and Holmes took a guess that . Norway reduce their tax in December so their citizens have more to spend . at Christmas, which was right, taking their total to £75,000. But they came unstuck on the next one with their big gamble. The question was worth £150,000 if answered correctly but would put them down to £50,000 if answered wrong.

Tiger Woods' half-brother has been arrested after making a bomb threat against the office building where he works in Phoenix, Arizona. Earl Dennison Woods Jr., one of Tiger's two older half-brothers, reportedly called in the bomb threat against the Arizona Department of Economic Security on Thursday. The 58-year-old admitted to building management that he was the one who called in the threat but said that it was a joke.

The Earls: Earl Woods Sr (right) died in 2006 and he was the one to introduce Tiger to golf . The building was evacuated and searched regardless and no harmful materials were found. Police told The Arizona Republic that Woods made the call shortly before 8.30am and said that he was going to blow up the building. Woods later repeated his claims to . police, saying that he was the unidentified caller who threatened the . office earlier that day. He was charged with one count of using an electronic device to threaten, terrify or harass. Released: Woods was released from Maricopa County jail Thursday night .

He was released from Maricopa County jail Thursday evening and stuck to his story when questioned by a local Fox 10 reporter. 'It was a joke, man. I was joking with co-workers,' Woods said to the reporter. While Earl may work in the security field as opposed to sports like his famous younger half-sibling, his daughter is also becoming a well-known name on the golf circuit. His 23-year-old daughter Cheyenne is now a professional golfer after joining the LPGA and qualifying in the 2012 U.S. Women's Open. Earl raised Cheyenne in Arizona, where the warm temperatures allowed for a long playing season, before she went to college at Wake Forest in North Carolina. She got the same start as her famous uncle as it was her grandfather, Earl Woods Sr, who was the first to put a golf club in her hands when she was an infant. She was just 19 months old when her mother, Susan, pushed her around Riviera Country Club in a stroller while uncle Tiger, then 16, made his PGA Tour debut. Woods then started playing competitive at age eight and went on to win more than 30 amateur tournaments, winning the 2011 Atlantic Coast Conference championship title. 'It's something that I always wanted to do since I was five years old and I started playing golf,' she said. 'Watching Tiger play as I grew up, I knew I wanted to get out (on tour) some day.'","Earl Dennison Woods, 58, is the elder half-brother of the golfing star and the father of up-and-comer Cheyenne Woods .

It is built upon the Allegory of the Cave by Greek philosopher Plato, which looked at the effect of education and the lack of it on our nature.

Sight to behold: Hauer rattled officials as the laser swept across their heads, eyewitnesses said . Jerome Hauer was giving a talk at the state police headquarters in Albany on October 24 to foreign officials when he drew out a handgun and used the laser sighting to point to a map of New York, according to the Times Union. In the process, an eyewitness told the paper, he moved the barrel across the heads of three Swedish emergency managers, who were said to be rather shaken by the experience. Two people quickly moved out of the way, another witness said. The briefing was about the stateâ€™s response to Superstorm Sandy.

The aging activists revealed to be behind a 1971 break-in at a Pennsylvania FBI office - . shedding light on a controversial surveillance program - felt compelled . to take part, they said. John Raines, 80, and his wife, Bonnie, were . part of an . eight-member group of anti-Vietnam War protesters that broke into the . offices in Media and left with 1,000 documents that revealed details of a . domestic FBI spying operation known as Cointelpro. 'We did it... because somebody had to do . it,' Mr Raines, a retired professor of religion at Temple . University, told NBC News. Revealed: John and Bonnie Raines have finally come forward after 43 years to admit they were two of the burglars who stole classified documents from the FBI offices in Pennsylvania in 1971 . 'In this case, by . breaking a law - entering, removing files - we exposed a crime that . was going on. When we are denied the information we need to have to . act as citizens, then we have a right to do what we did.' His . wife added: 'I was horrified that our government was lying to us about . what was actually happening in Vietnam. And all the usual things we . always did - picketing, marching, signing petitions - didn't make any . difference whatsoever.' The . case has similarities with that of Edward Snowden, who last year leaked . details of the NSA's controversial surveillance programs. Mr Raines . said he had a message for Snowden. 'From one whistelblower to another whistleblower - Hi!' he said, lifting his arm to wave. The couple and a former Philadelphia cab driver, Keith Forsyth, identified themselves in new book 'The Burglary: The . Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's Secret FBI' written by former Washington . Post reporter Betty Medsger. Medsger was the first reporter to write a story about their findings. Passionate: The couple, left, said they had to . break-in the files because nothing else was working in their battled . against the government. The FBI released this sketch of Bonnie after the . break in . Satellite: The group targeted the FBI's smaller Media branch because they thought there was less risk involved . Scene: The team broke in to the office, pictured, after studying its layout for weeks before . In the book, the group also details . how they pulled it off and managed to stay anonymous when J. Edgar . Hoover dispatched 200 agents to find the culprits. The sting was organized by Haverford College physics professor Bill Davidon who has since died. Instead . of breaking into the FBI's main office, they decided to aim for the . less-guarded Media office at a time when no one would notice: March 8, . the night Muhammed Ali fought Joe Frazier. In . the weeks leading up to the break-in, the group cased the office in . their hippie van and even sent in Bonnie Raines dressed as a college . student to get details on the interior layout of the office. 'I tried to disguise my appearance as much as I could,' Mrs Raines told NBC News.  'I had long, dark, hippie hair at that time and I stuffed it up inside of a winter hat.' She . pretended to interview an FBI official about job prospects for women . for the school paper, and never once took off her gloves the whole time . so she wouldn't leave any finger prints. Tricks: Bonnie, left, posed as a student to . check out the inside of the office and helped break in on the night of . the robbery. Her husband, John, right, stayed outside in a getaway car . as they broke in . Political: John and Bonnie Raines said the change the break-in caused far outweighed breaking the law . On the night of the break-in the group only ran into one roadblock. They were forced to use another entrance to the office since the main door's lock couldn't be picked. A back door ceded easily to a crow . bar however and the group of eight tore through the office's cabinets . looking for incriminating papers. After . the break-in at Media, Pennsylvania in 1941, the team left with more . than 1,000 documents that they looked through and then filtered to the . media. Their central discovery was about COINTELPRO. Short for Counter Intelligence Program, it was originally J. Edgar Hoover's solution to break-up Communist groups. It tracked the activity of domestic political groups it considered subversive. It aimed to discredit those in the group and destroy their public image. It . was later used in plans to bring down the Black Panthers, anti-Vietnam . war movements and other civil rights groups. A Senate group later determined that . legal restrictions had been ignored in creating the program, and asked: . 'What happened to turn a law enforcement agency into a law violator?'

On a dive-boat drifting along the blue waters of the Great Barrier Reef, a cheer of relief erupted as the clouds moved away at the moment of total eclipse, followed by a hush as darkness fell across the water. One scuba diver floated on his back in the sea, watching the phenomenon unfold as he bobbed in the waves. Birds on a nearby island, startled by the sudden lack of light, began to stir. 'It was absolutely amazing.

'We got a full view - absolutely breathtaking.' An eclipse occurs when the moon passes in front of the sun, which darkens the sky and causes temperatures to drop. The eclipse will cast its 150-kilometer . (95-mile) wide shadow starting at dawn in Australia's Northern Territory . and then cross the northeast tip of the country before swooping east . across the South Pacific. The Moon's penumbral shadow produces a partial eclipse visible from a much larger region covering the South Pacific (including Australia and New Zealand), southern South America, and part of Antarctica. Many worried that they would miss a rare chance to view the celestial phenomenon. 'There will be breaks in (the clouds), but it's just a matter of the luck of the draw whether you get a break at the right time,' said Queensland state Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Andrew Mostyn. The eclipse cast its 150-kilometer (95-mile) wide shadow starting at dawn in Australia's Northern Territory and then crossed the northeast tip of the country before swooping east across the South Pacific. No islands are in its direct path, so northern Australia is the only land where the full eclipse could be seen, said Geoff Wyatt, an astronomer with Sydney Observatory. A partial eclipse was expected to be visible from east Indonesia, the eastern half of Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and southern parts of Chile and Argentina. Totality - the darkness that happens at the peak of the eclipse - lasted just over two minutes. Among those sweating out the forecast was U.S. astronomer Jay Pasachoff, who traveled to Australia in hopes of viewing his 56th solar eclipse. Pasachoff, an astronomy professor at Williams College in Massachusetts, and a team of about 50 scientists and students fanned out across the region to improve the odds that at least some of them will see the eclipse.

'Just imagine you were a heart surgeon and someone actually told you you could look inside a human heart only for two minutes, and only if you went halfway around the world, he said. 'You would do it.' Some Queensland hotels have been booked up for more than three years and more than 50,000 people flooded into the region to watch the solar spectacle, said Jeff Gillies, regional director of Queensland Tourism.

Suzette Billington, 71, lives 200 yards from the River Tone on the Somerset Levels and her 150-year-old property used to be flooded nearly every winter. But, after repeatedly bailing out the house, her late husband Douglas - a former Royal Navy lieutenant - encircled his two-acre garden with a floodbank.

Nowadays: The couple were attracted by the romance of the rural wilderness which flowers into a paradise during summer months . How it used to look: Douglas and Suzette Billington's flood-prone home in Stoke St Gregory, near Taunton, pictured in the 1990s before the flood barrier was built . Now, more than a decade later, the defences are still holding and widowed Mrs Billington is dry as the fields around her are submerged under 3ft of water. She said today: ‘The defence was my husband’s idea - he decided the beautiful house did not always need to flood. ‘The land has flooded for the past two years and the defence has still held so I’m very grateful for it. I have lots of moral support now I’m on my own. ‘Friends bring me things and helpfully drive me to my car.’ Mrs Billington and her retired husband bought the flood-prone home in Stoke St Gregory, near Taunton, in 1994.

A pensioner has received a £900,000 tax bill despite living in a small terraced house on a pension and limited savings. Don Yates, 72, said he was stunned when he opened a letter demanding a payment of £576,850.85 - a sum that left his daughter wondering if her father was a secret millionaire. The bill arrived at his £80,000 home in Chorley, Lancashire, just months after another for £384,567.25, which the retired councillor misread as £384 because he had been sick with the flu. Shock: Don Yates received two bills from the Inland Revenue - one for £576,850 and another for £384,567. The demand comes despite 72-year-old living on a pension and savings amounting to £11,000-a-year . Despite his hefty tax bill, Mr Yates lives on a pension and savings amounting to just £11,000 a year and says he would need to pay back the enormous demands at a rate of £1 a week. He added that when he showed the bill to his daughter, she asked if his modest lifestyle had been a front and if he was in fact a secret millionaire. Mr Yates, a former Chorley borough . and Lancashire county councillor, who was chairman of the county council . in 1996-97, said: 'When I opened the first letter I was ill with flu and so I misread it and thought it was for £384.' He added: 'It was only when the second letter came when I realised the bill was far bigger than that.' Adding up: The second demand Don Yates received was for £576,850.85, leaving his daughter wondering if her father was a secret millionaire. He says he would have to pay at a rate of £1 to be able to afford the repayment . Extreme: Don Yates owns a small £80,000 terraced house in Chorley, Lancashire (left). The former county councillor (right) says he would have had to sell his home many times over to pay the HMRC demand . Mr Yates says he was initially distressed to receive the bill, but a discussion with his daughter helped him not to panic. He said: 'I was very shocked but luckily I had my daughter to turn to and talk it through which really helped me stay calm.'

A driver pulling into a fueling station in Massachusetts Monday struck an attendant, knocked over a pump and sparked a blaze after accidentally hitting the accelerator instead of the brake. The fiery incident took place at around 11.30am at the 1A Auto Clinic in Walpole and was caught on a surveillance camera. The footage shows the driver, 83-year-old Ed Grace, smashing his Toyota Avalon into a gas station worker, who was thrown on impact 30 feet in the air, according to police. Scroll down for video . Bad move: The driver of this silver Toyota Avalon was trying to bring the vehicle to a stop in front of a pump at 1A Auto Clinic in Walpole, Massachusetts, but accidentally hit the accelerator . Before and after: A gas station attendant seen left before the crash was struck by the Toyota and thrown 30 feet in the air . The man's vehicle then careens into one of the pumps, which bursts into flames after being knocked off its base. Moments later, another employee at the auto center could be seen rushing over with a fire extinguisher and putting out the blaze before it has a chance to spread to adjacent pumps. The gas station attendant involved in the crash escaped with bruises. The driver was left shaken by the collision but otherwise unharmed.

The filling station employee who was thrown in the air suffered severe bruises . Scary moment: The tossed gas station attendant was able to crawl to the sidewalk while his quick-thinking co-worker extinguished the flames . The octogenarian explained that he was trying to bring his Toyota Avalon to a stop in front of a pump to fuel up, but instead his foot hit the gas pedal. The motorist recounted seeing the injured service station employee crawling from the busy Main Street where he ended up to the sidewalk. Mr Grace has not been charged in the incident, but his car has been impounded as police continued to investigate the crash. The 83-year-old driver said he would consider giving up his license in the wake of the accident. 'Iâ€™m totally shook up,' he told the station. 'Iâ€™m still upset.' The elderly motorist added that he would like to meet with the gas station attendant whom he had struck and apologize to him.

A teenager who vanished after taking out the rubbish was upset because her family’s asylum-seeker status barred her from attending university. Nida Ul-Naseer, 18, of Newport, South Wales, has not been seen since stepping outside her home in Linton Street on December 28. Her family revealed today that their attempt to seek asylum in the UK from Pakistan was turned down a year ago. Scroll down for video . The family of missing teenager Nida Ul Naseer spoke at a Newport press conference where they appealed for her safe return . The family of Nida Ul-Naseer revealed today that their attempt to seek asylum in the UK from Pakistan was turned down a year ago . It meant that academically-gifted Nida opted to retake a business studies course she had already passed. Her sister, Shamyla, 23, told a press conference today that she believed Nida’s disappearance stemmed from being upset because she could not attend university. 'I think that not being able to go to university is the reason for her leaving,' she said, speaking alongside other family members at Newport Central police station. She said her sister had been upset and angry about the situation before she vanished. Nida might also have been barefoot when she disappeared three days after Christmas, it has emerged. Police said it was not known if she had taken anything to put on her feet, although if she had planned to leave it was likely. 18-year-old Nida went missing from the family home on the 28th December. Her sister, Shamyla Naseer, said she believed Nida's disappearance stemmed from being upset because she could not attend university . The teenager suffers from a medical condition and needs medication without which she is likely to become anaemic. Her sister revealed today that Nida had been taking iron supplements and also suffered from heartburn. The teenager had been unhappy for some time about not being able to attend university. Her sister said she had seen friends who did less well in their exams go on to university. She went to college instead but remained unhappy. Before she left she had argued with her family about her inability to go to university and was 'shouting and crying'. Her father, Naseer Tahir, who was also at the press conference, said in broken English that he was happy for his daughter to attend university. He added that he was sad he was not able to provide her with what she wanted. The conference heard that Nida did not have a boyfriend and was described by her family as 'very religious'. Plea: Shamyla Naseer said her sister had been upset and angry . The family have been seeking asylum in the UK for five years. Their passports are held by the Home Office. Sister Shamyla began the interview with a direct appeal to her missing sister, saying: 'Nida, please come back home. We are desperately worried about you. Nida, we need you. Nida, please come back home, we cannot live without you.' The family’s plea to Nida came as the police also made a direct appeal to the teenager during the press conference. Superintendent Mark Warrender said: 'Nida, if you are watching or listening to this please, please get in touch. Your family is desperately worried about you and all they want to know, and we want to know, is that you are safe and well.' He also gave an update on the progress of the investigation, but acknowledged that there had been no sightings of Nida since she left home. Mr Warrender said forensic examination of the teenager’s mobile phone, to which she was addicted, and other electronic devices was ongoing. Officers are also sifting through hundreds of hours of CCTV footage taken from the area to see whether they recorded any of her movements. He said investigators were keeping an open mind with regard to Nida’s disappearance and all and any lines of inquiry would be followed up.

He added: 'It may be that if she planned to leave she may have had something to put on her feet.'","Nida Ul-Naseer, 18, of Newport, South Wales, went missing on December 28 .

Rubber stamped: A senior official approved Paul Flowers job as chief of the Co-Op bank despite knowing that his only experience was as a clerk . The appointment of Reverend Paul Flowers as Co-op Bank chairman came despite the City watchdog knowing his banking experience was limited to four years as a clerk in the 1960s, MPs were told yesterday. Clive Adamson, who was a senior figure at the now-defunct Financial Services Authority, rubber-stamped the appointment after a 90-minute interview in 2010, even though he also knew the disgraced former Methodist minister had been convicted for gross indecency. The senior regulator, now head of supervision at the new Financial Conduct Authority, was hauled to appear before the Treasury Select Committee yesterday. The panel of MPs and peers is investigating the near-collapse of the so-called ‘ethical’ bank, which secured a rescue package last month to plug a £1.5billion black hole in its finances. Flowers quit his £132,000-a-year job last summer after the shortfall was identified. But in November, footage emerged of him allegedly buying crystal meth and crack cocaine. He is now on police bail. He has also been accused of using his work email while a Labour councillor in Bradford to organise drug-fuelled orgies with rent boys. Mr Adamson said he was aware of Reverend Flowers’s spent conviction for gross indecency after he was caught performing a sex act in a public toilet in 1981, but said the nature of the conviction was deemed to be ‘not directly relevant to his ability  to do the job’. MPs also grilled Mr Adamson about why he approved the man now dubbed the ‘Crystal Methodist’ to run a bank despite knowing he lacked relevant skills. Mr Adamson rejected accusations from committee chairman Andrew Tyrie that the appointment was ‘negligent’, saying: ‘I don’t think it was a mistake in terms of the decision I made at the time with the information I had.’ Before revelations over his private life emerged, the suspended minister admitted to the Treasury Committee in November that his only banking experience was four years as a clerk after leaving university in the late 1960s. The Reverend’s lack of knowledge was highlighted when he was asked by MPs to estimate the size of the Co-op Bank’s balance sheet. He said it was £3billion, only to be informed that the real size was £47billion. Mr Adamson said he knew the Reverend lacked banking experience but said he gave more ‘cogent’ answers in the 2010 interview. Instead, he said the Reverend was appointed to bring together an ‘unruly board of 22 indididuals’ at the bank. But Mr Tyrie responded: ‘One of your solutions to taming this unruly board was putting in a financial illiterate as its chair.’ Asked by Mr Tyrie if he would approve of chair of nuclear power station who knew nothing about nuclear energy, Mr Adamson responded: 'It would depend on the circumstances.' Mr Adamson rejected accusations from committee chairman Andrew Tyrie that the appointment was ‘negligent’. He said: . ‘I don’t think it was a mistake in terms of the decision I made at the time with the information I had.’ Asked . about Flowers’ past conviction, he added: ‘We regarded it, but it was . from 1981 and we didn’t think that the nature of that conviction was . directly relevant to his ability to do the job. We had to be very . careful not to draw inferences from people’s private lives into their . professional lives’. Mr Adamson also admitted he was unaware of Flowers’ later conviction for drink driving in 1990.

He has been accused of using his work email to organise drugs fuelled orgies with rent boys.

It sealed a rescue package last month to plug a £1.5billion black hole in its finances. The Co-op Group, the funeral services to supermarkets giant which owned the Co-op Bank, has ceded control of the lender to hedge funds.

Bulgarian immigrant Atanas Miryanov, 38, was tonight beginning a 17-year prison sentence after being convicted of raping a woman in a Sutton bedsit . A Bulgarian immigrant who lured a woman to his flat with the promise of a job before raping her was tonight beginning a 17-year prison sentence. Atanas Miryanov 38. invited the 26-year-old woman to his bedsit in Sutton, Surrey, on the pretext of interviewing her after she . responded to his  online advert seeking women to work at a car-wash. Miryanov, a convicted rapist who had only been the UK for 11 months, raped her, threatened her with a knife and then tried to push her out of a second-floor window, Croydon Crown Court heard. Today he was jailed for 17 years for the attack after a judge branded him a 'dangerous and predatory criminal.' The . jury heard that the woman, who is also Bulgarian, communicated with a . man she believed was called Georgi, after responding to the online . advert placed on Novoto, a Bulgarian, Gumtree-style listings website. On . July 1 last year she went to the bedsit in Sutton Common Road, Sutton, . Surrey and was told that the manager of the car-wash would be arriving . later. The . woman was made to wait for several hours while Miryanov, who pretended his name was 'Georgi', drank alcohol, tried to ply her with alcohol, and became increasingly drunk. When the woman decided to leave, Miryanov threw her on the bed and raped her.  During the ordeal he held a knife to the woman's throat after she feigned an asthma attack. She managed to get to a second floor window in a bid to escape but Miryanov then tried to push her out of it. The victim's screams were heard by several passers-by and other occupants of the property, leading to police being called. Miryanov was arrested, but claimed that the victim had consented to having sex with him. Today he was found guilty of rape and the court was told that he had committed a similar offence in Germany 10 years before. Sentencing, the Recorder of Croydon, . Warwick McKinnon told the the car-wash worker, who sat in the dock in a . grey tracksuit: 'This has had an appalling and devastating effect on the . victim and it will take many, many years for her to recover. How he lured his victim: Miryanov advertised for car-wash workers on Bulgarian language website, Novoto . 'You have a previous conviction in not very different circumstances where a knife is involved for which you were sentenced to eight years. 'I have no doubt in assessing you as dangerous by virtue of the seriousness of the offence and your previous conviction.' 'You have shown no remorse for this dreadful offence. You tricked a woman into your home, you tried to ply her with alcohol without success. 'When she decided the job was not for her and she tried to leave, you stopped her from doing so and carried out an attack of sustained violence.' Prosecutor Kate Blumgart told the court how he manipulated his victim following the attack, telling her that no-one would believe her if she told them what had happened. The court heard how Miryanov had also used a knife in his 2002 attack in Germany, and claimed sex was consensual. Sentencing Miryanov at Croydon Crown Court, the Recorder of Croydon, Warwick McKinnon, told him he was 'dangerous' Detective Sergeant Janet Archibald, of the Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command, said afterwards: 'Miryanov subjected the victim in this case to a terrifying sexual assault. 'The victim said she was prepared to risk her own life in order to escape from him and she did this by climbing semi-naked and precariously onto a high window ledge, and fortunately her cries were heard by members of the public.' A spokesman for the UK Border Agency said efforts would now be made to deport Miryanov. They said the recent lifting of immigration restrictions on Bulgarians to the UK would not affect UK policy to deport EU nationals who are sentenced to 12 months or more for crimes involving drugs or sexual or violent crimes. Implying that nothing of Miryanov's previous conviction was known when he entered the UK, the UKBA spokesman said: 'Where we receive . information that foreign nationals present a genuine threat to society, . we are able to take action to prevent their entry to the UK. 'The onus for flagging any threat lies with the authorities in the individualâ€™s home country. 'The Government is doing everything it can to prevent immigration abuse and, . as the Home Secretary has said, it is right that EU members look to . reform the way free movement rules work in future.' The spokesman said a new information sharing system, to be introduced in October this year, would improve European-wide police information sharing. The second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) will allow British police to access EU law enforcement alerts, which will help prevent criminals entering the UK.","Atanas Miryanov, 38, lured his victim to his Sutton bedsit with fake job ad .

Jailed: Gareth Mason slit his ex-girlfriend's throat and killed her new boyfriend in a night-time ambush at a caravan park in Heysham, Lancashire . A father has been jailed for life after slitting his ex-girlfriend's throat and killing her new boyfriend in a night-time ambush. Gareth Mason, 26, tracked down Katrina Rudrum and her new partner Adam Stirrup to a caravan park in Heysham, Lancashire. He stabbed the mother of his son in the chest and back, before cutting her throat with a kitchen knife. He then killed 28-year-old Mr Stirrup by stabbing him in the chest, neck, face, arms and hands. Miss Rudrum, 26, and her boyfriend had been trying to keep their address a secret from Mason, Preston Crown Court heard. However, the father of one managed to track down the couple to Stud Holme Farm Holiday Park after scouring caravan sites in the area. He then crept around on the roof of their caravan in the early hours of August 4, before forcing his way into the vehicle and launching the frenzied stabbing attack. Louise Blackwell QC, prosecuting, said: 'Miss Rudrum believed she was being punched in the face, but he was stabbing her with a knife. 'She felt the warmth of her own blood and realised she must have been stabbed.' During the assault, Mason pinned his ex-girlfriend's arms behind her back and slit her throat with the knife. Victims: He stabbed Katrina Rudrum (left) in the chest and back, before slitting her throat with a kitchen knife. He then killed her new partner Adam Stirrup (right) by stabbing him in the chest, neck, face, arms and hands . Murder scene: Father-of-one Mason tracked down the couple to Stud Holme Farm Holiday Park (pictured) However, despite her horrific injuries, Miss Rudrum managed to shield Mr . Stirrup's 13-year-old daughter - who was also staying in the caravan - from Mason, before collapsing. Miss Blackwell said that a number of . neighbours had heard 'blood curdling' female screams coming from the caravan - with one witness . hearing a woman say 'no no oh god' followed by a male voice saying 'come back . you silly f***ing bitch'. She said Mason - who has a three-year-old son with Miss Rudrum - had then stabbed Mr Stirrup numerous times, before throwing the knife over a fence and fleeing the scene. Mr Stirrup, a bus driver, was taken to hospital after staggering to a nearby caravan park, but later died from multiple wounds to his lungs and abdomen. Attack: The 26-year-old crept around on the roof of the couple's caravan, before forcing his way into the vehicle . Deadly: He then launched the stabbing attack - killing Mr Stirrup and leaving Miss Rudrum seriously injured . Following the attack, Mason called . his mother in Stoke-on-Trent and told her to immediately collect him . from his home in Morecambe because 'something was badly wrong', the . court heard. His mother then drove him and his three-year-old son . to her home, where he was later found by . police hiding in the toilet. Yesterday, Mason, of Westminster . Road, pleaded guilty to murder and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Miss Blackwell said Mason and Miss Rudrum had been in a violent, 'on-off' relationship before they broke up. In . March 2012, Mason was sentenced to a community order after he admitted . two counts of battery over a series of violent acts against Miss Rudrum, including strangulation, banging her head and dropping furniture on her. Miss Blackwell said: 'Certainly by the summer of the last year Katrina Rudrum wanted . to leave the defendant but it seemed the defendant was incapable of . letting her go.' She said Mason had bombarded his ex-lover with unreturned phone calls and text . messages in the hours leading up to the attack - with his last text reading: 'Are you ignoring me because you are with him?' He had then gone home to collect the knife . before heading to the caravan site where Miss Rudrum and her new . partner lived. When interviewed by police, Mason initially denied he was at the holiday park - however, he later confessed to both stabbings. In memory: Flowers are left at the scene of the horrific attack, which happened in the early hours of August 4 . He . claimed he had collected the knife to slash the caravan's tyres, but had 'lost it' when the couple came outside after . hearing noises. 'I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t go round there to stab him. I just lost it and then that’s it,' he told police. In a victim impact statement, Mr Stirrup’s mother Gail described her son as a 'good, honest and nice guy' who would 'give anything to his family'. 'He always thought of others before himself,' she said. 'We are devastated by our loss.' Although Miss Rudrum has been left with permanent scars following the attack, she has made a 'sterling effort to try and . recover some semblance of her life', said Miss Blackwell. However, she is on anti-depressants, has . lost her job and does not feel safe. Sentencing . Mason to life, with a minimum of 24 years, Judge Stuart Baker told him he had committed 'two dreadful acts'. 'The death of Mr Stirrup at your hands was truly an appalling waste of life,' he added.","Gareth Mason, 26, attacked Katrina Rudrum at caravan park in Heysham .

Police should mount patrols at polling stations in 16 towns and cities to combat vote-rigging, Britain’s elections watchdog warns today. The Electoral Commission has identified a list of areas considered ‘vulnerable’ to voting fraud. The at-risk areas include Britain’s second city Birmingham, the scene of a notorious ballot-rigging case in 2004 which the presiding judge said would ‘disgrace a banana republic’. Election: Police should mount patrols at polling stations in 16 towns and cities to combat vote-rigging, Britain's elections watchdog warns today . Many of the areas identified have large south Asian communities, but the watchdog says it would be a ‘mistake’ to think electoral fraud only takes place within them. It warns, however, there is particular concern at the ‘vulnerability of some South Asian communities, specifically those with roots in parts of Pakistan or Bangladesh, to electoral fraud’. It goes on: ‘The evidence and views we have heard raise significant questions about whether individuals within these communities are able effectively to exercise their right to vote, and whether they are able to participate in elections on the same basis as other electors across the UK.’ The watchdog says it is also commissioning more work into voting fraud within the South Asian community. Concerns include whether men pressure their wives and children to vote in a particular way. The Electoral Commission has identified a list of areas considered 'vulnerable' to voting fraud (file picture) Today’s report calls for increased police involvement in elections in 16 parts of England. As well as Birmingham, they include: Blackburn with Darwen, Bradford, Burnley, Calderdale, Coventry, Derby, Hyndburn, Kirklees, Oldham, Pendle, Peterborough, Slough, Tower Hamlets, Walsall, and Woking. All 16 areas have a history of alleged voting fraud. At one point the Electoral Commission considered a total ban on postal voting in these areas in order to combat fraud. But, following a public consultation, it decided this would unfairly hit many ordinary people who need to vote by post. Instead it has urged the police to mount patrols at polling stations during future elections in the 16 named areas and target more resources at investigating allegations of electoral fraud, which critics complain have been a low priority for the police. Returning officers have also been urged to take ‘sustained action’ to identify suspect patterns of voting and voter registration. The report also calls for voters to be required to show photo ID at polling stations. And it calls for political parties to be banned from handling postal ballots under any circumstances. The watchdog says it will call for a change in the law to ban political activists from handling postal ballots if they refuse to comply with a new code of conduct. Lib Dem MP John Hemming, who has campaigned for action to tackle vote-rigging, welcomed the report but said further action was needed. ‘Greater involvement of the police would be welcome because intimidation is an issue – I am aware of incidents of polling clerks being intimidated into handing over ballot papers to party representatives. ‘The whole issue of what happens in polling stations needs more attention. I would like to see filming inside polling stations, not of how people vote, but of what else goes on.’ Overall, the commission found electoral fraud was ‘not widespread’, but added: ‘Despite this, a significant proportion of the public remain concerned that it is taking place.’","Electoral Commission identified areas considered ‘vulnerable’

A police officer, her lover and his wife stole thousands of road crash victims' details from her force computer and sold them to injury lawyers in a conspiracy that could have been worth £1million, a court heard. Former constable Sugra Hanif, 27, allegedly downloaded the personal files of people involved in accidents before pressurising them into claiming compensation so she could claim £800 referral fees from solicitors. Hanif was having an affair with co-accused Raza Khan, also 27, for eight months of the 11-month scheme - but ended it when they were arrested after an anonymous tip-off, prosecutors claim. Accused: Sugra Hanif, 27, (left) allegedly downloaded unique reference numbers from Thames Valley Police computers. Raza Khan, 27, and his wife Paramjeet Kaur, 26, are also accused of conspiring to get up to £1million in solicitor referral fees. The jury at Winchester Crown Court heard the lovers, with Khan's wife, Paramjeet Kaur, 26, set up three companies in April 2011 before selling a total of 2,456 unique reference numbers for £26,400 to various firms. Peter Asteris, prosecuting, said: 'If all of the data stolen had been converted into referral fees, if they had kept going, the value of those referral fees would have been worth over £1 million. 'Every day, tens of thousands of police officers go out there and perform their duties sometimes at not inconsiderable risk to themselves, and they do so as we would expect them to, with duty, responsibility and integrity. 'Integrity, honesty and duty are really what this case is all about. One of these defendants, Sugra Hanif, was a serving police officer with Thames Valley Police. Denial: Khan and Kaur, here leaving Winchester Crown Court, claim they did not know the illegal source of the information . 'The Crown's case against her is that she doesn't have integrity, she didn't fulfil her duties to us, the public, in the way she ought and she abused her position and she abused it with the assistance of the other two defendants in the dock. 'All three of them have been involved in a conspiracy to obtain confidential police information.' He continued: 'She had accessed, I am going to suggest, a staggering 2,456 URNs, different incidents, on the computer and almost all of them had no connection with her duties, no connection with her responsibilities as an investigating officer. 'The Crown says she was abusing that system and stealing 2,500 people's details from that computer system. She had on almost every case no valid reason for doing so whatsoever. 'We say it was nothing short of a deliberate and cynical abuse of the privilege she had been given by having access to that system in the first place.' All three defendants deny the charges. Mr Asteris said that on March 2011, Khan . registered a company called SR Auto Repairs Limited and the following . month Hanif began to steal the police data. And Hanif told police that the S and the R in the company . referred to the initials of her first name and Khan's, he added. Khan denies this. Mr Asteris said that the group went on to set . up a second company in May 2011, registered under Kaur's name, to handle . the growing number of cases. He said a third company was then set up, again under Kaur, who claims ignorance of the illegal source of the data. The jury heard Hanif claims Khan threatened and blackmailed her to steal the data, while Khan insists he did not know the source was illegal. Mr Asteris said: 'That defence is an absolute nonsense and doesn't stand up to any scrutiny. 'It . is more than a coincidence that these two people, who are lovers, set up . a company with the initials of their first two names. 'They became lovers and it seems that relationship has continued on for most of time we are dealing with in this case. The jury heard Hanif, here leaving court with her solicitor, set up three companies with her co-accused to pressurise victims into claiming compensation . 'The Crown says this conspiracy was planned out in advance, particularly by Mr Khan and Miss Hanif. 'Miss Hanif appears to suggest to police in her interview that her involvement in taking this data illegally was that she had been forced to by Mr Khan. 'She says that in fact she was being blackmailed and threatened and he threatened to disclose things to her family and employer.' He said Khan sent her an email which included the lines 'I will never stop loving you' and 'Thanks for the great sex' and 'At least you blew out my candle on my birthday'. He explained that of the 500 calls from Hanif's mobile phone to Khan during the period of the conspiracy, many were just before and after she accessed information on the police computer. The prosecutor added that Hanif would also contact the accident victims and use 'pressure sales' techniques. He also said that £1,600 in cash was found by police at Khan's house. The trial, which is expected to last a month, continues.","Sugra Hanif, 27, 'downloaded 2,456 unique reference numbers from Thames Valley Police computers and sold them to injury lawyers for £800 fee each'

The introduction of 5p plastic bag charge should be brought forward amid hopes it will drastically cut the number and raise £70million a year for good causes, say MPs. Current Government policy means the 5p charge will not be introduced in England until October 2015 at the earliest. However, MPs on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee (EFRA) say they are ‘disappointed’ at the delay and want a speedier launch. Current Government policy means the 5p charge will not be introduced in England until October 2015 at the earliest . Wales introduced a 5p charge in . October 2011, while Northern Ireland followed suit in April 2013 and . Scotland plans to do so in October this year. However, . David Cameron’s government has dragged its heels on implementing a . charge, while it has also watered down the scheme for England, adding . confusion and complexity. In . the other nations, the 5p charge applies to all single use bags and . across all retailers, regardless of the size of the business and number . of stores. However, the . charge in England will not apply to biodegradable or paper bags, while . small shops employing less than 250 people will be exempt. Wales introduced a 5p charge in October 2011, while Northern Ireland followed suit in April 2013 . Conservation . and anti-litter campaigns have criticised the complex regime for . England, saying it will be less effective in controlling the litter and . waste caused by the bags. The big supermarkets are also . critical, saying it will make their lives more difficult by having . different rules for different parts of the UK. Even . the Association of Convenience Stores, which represents corner shops, . say it would be better if there was a single uniform scheme of bag . charges that also applied to its members. The . EFRA committee is currently carrying out a short inquiry into the . adoption of the 5p bag charge in England, however it has separately . published an annual review saying it should be brought forward. The 11 man all-party committee is chaired by Conservative MP, Anne McIntosh, and includes five other Conservatives. The review states: ‘Plastic bags are a major cause of seaborne pollution, and a serious hazard for marine life. ‘The . Government estimates that in 2012, supermarkets gave out over eight . billion single-use carrier bags across the UK, equating to approximately . 120 bags per person. ‘While . the use of these plastic carrier bags in England has increased since . 2010, usage was cut dramatically by the Republic of Ireland after . charges were introduced in 2002. A similar charge in Northern Ireland has reduced carrier bag usage since April 2013. Supermarkets in Wales reported a drop in use of up to 76per cent after a charging scheme was brought in two years ago.’ They add: ‘We are pleased that the Government has finally agreed to impose a charge for single-use plastic carrier bags in supermarkets and larger food retailers. However, we are disappointed that the charge will not come into effect in England until 2015, despite evidence of its success in reducing plastic carrier bag usage in other parts of the UK and Ireland. ‘Reducing the number of single-use carrier bags which are given away is a quick win: reducing both waste and environmental pollution with little effort. ‘Given the evidence elsewhere, we recommend the early introduction of the charge.’ Environment minister, Dan Rogerson, recently told MPs that the 5p for plastic bags will cut usage by 60-80 per cent and so vastly reduce pollution and litter. The resulting reduction in carbon emissions would be the equivalent of permanently taking up to 2.8million cars off the road, he said. The proceeds from the levy, which comes as victory for the Daily Mail’s Banish the Bags campaign, will be given to good causes. Community organisations and charities will get up to £70million a year to deal with the impact of plastic pollution on wildlife and the environment. Litter policy expert at the Marine Conservation Society, Dr Sue Kinsey, criticised the delay and complexity of the bag charging scheme planned for England. ‘Some totally superfluous and unhelpful exemptions have been brought in, which will cause confusion to retailers and consumers alike,’ she said. She said the exemptions for paper bags and biodegradable bags are not justified, while the decision not to require charges at small stores is ‘very worrying’. ‘This could cause major confusion and headaches for retailers and for customers who won’t recognise what kind of business  they are shopping in. Surely giving a level playing field to all retailers is beneficial,’ said Dr Kinsey. ‘We have a well understood and popular system already bedded in and working well in Wales. Having a different system in England is totally unnecessary and can only cause confusion all round.’","Current Government policy means the 5p charge will not be introduced in England until October 2015 .

Attack: Former Minister Tom Watson has blasted Tony Blair's Labour administration for giving rise to the betting crisis across the UK today . New Labour ‘dropped the ball’ by giving the green light to fixed odds betting terminals dubbed the ‘crack cocaine’ of the High Street, a leading Labour MP said last night. Former Minister Tom Watson said Labour ‘should never have licensed these machines’ as his party prepares today to force a Commons vote on the issue. Liberal Democrats - who want a crackdown on the betting machines - will be challenged to back a Labour motion calling for councils to get the right to ban the terminals if they cause problem gambling and anti-social behaviour. But Mr Watson said fixed odds terminals, which allow punters to lose up to £300 a minute on computer roulette, should never have been licensed in the Gambling of Act of 2005. He told the BBC’s Daily Politics show: ‘There’s a body of evidence that these particular kind of machines create in gambling addicts, and that’s something that Parliament should act on. 'Frankly we [Labour] should never really have licensed these machines in the way we did in 2005 and we should put the matter right as quickly as possible. ‘At the time all MPs let this category of machines go through almost on the nod. Our concern was supercasinos and the machines that go into supercasinos. ‘We basically dropped the ball on this one. We didn’t understand the impact this technology would have on the High Street. Now’s the time to put it right.’ Campaigners say there is academic evidence that the fixed odds machines are more addictive than other forms of gambling and say they are used by criminals to launder their money. But ministers have refused to act until a review into betting machines is completed this autumn - a review that critics complain has been funded by the gambling industry. Mr Watson said waiting for the review is ‘like waiting for the polar ice caps to melt -- we’ve been waiting years for this’. Punters lose up to £300 a minute on computer roulette games in high street betting shops like Coral . There are more than 33,000 FOBTs in Britain, with up to four in each high street betting shop. The so-called B2 machines made bookmakers £1.55billion last year - around half their annual profits -- with up to £1.2 billion of that coming from the fixed odds games. Ed Miliband has announced that a future Labour government would give councils the power to ban high-stakes roulette machines from bookmakers’ shops if they pose problems in their communities. Labour also plan to change the law so the time between plays is doubled from 20 to 40 seconds and put betting shops in a separate planning class so that councils can use planning powers to control the number opening in their area. That last idea was endorsed by the Liberal Democrats at their party conference last September. Shadow Sports Minister Clive Efford challenged the Lib Dems to back Labour’s motion in the Commons today: ‘Across the country, traditional bookies are being turned into mini-casinos, where people can gamble up to £300-a-minute. Saturday's Mail: We went to get a first-hand view of the crippling effects of fixed-odds betting terminals . The next Labour government will give powers to local communities to ban high stakes gambling machines from high streets. ‘Over recent months, we’ve seen the Tories and Lib Dems posturing on fixed odds betting machines, but totally failing to act. ‘If the Tories and Lib Dems refuse to back Labour’s proposals they’ll have to answer why they are standing up for the large betting companies rather than communities across the country.’ But former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy made clear that his party would not back Labour’s motion because they are waiting for the review to conclude. Charles Kennedy: ‘I just think this is pre-emptive and premature. I have every sympathy with Tom’s argument and I hope the review will endorse it up this is putting the cart before the horse. It’s procedural not principled.’ Peter Craske, of the Association of British Bookmakers, said: ‘Gaming machines in betting shops are not new, they have been enjoyed by our customers for over 12 years. ‘This motion is just playing politics with the livelihoods of 40,000 staff and the enjoyment of eight million people. ‘Our new code for responsible gambling introduces new measures that will reduce harm, letting players set their own limits on the time they play or the amount they spend. ‘Banning a product for a political punch line does nothing to help problem gambler.’","Former Minister said body of evidence shows terminals fuel addiction .

Sentenced: Marian McGlinchey, also known as Marian Price (left), leaves Belfast Crown Court today after being spared jail for her part in the 2009 County Antrim bomb attack . Old Bailey bomber Marian McGlinchey has avoided returning to jail for dissident republican terror offences after being handed a suspended sentence. The 59-year-old, who was given a life term in 1973 for her part in the bomb attack on the London court, last year admitted to providing a mobile phone to the Real IRA gang for a 2009 attack that killed two British soldiers. She was caught on CCTV buying the device – which was then used by the terror group in the attack on Massereene Army barracks in 2009. Royal Engineer soldiers Mark Quinsey and Patrick Azimkar were shot dead by gunmen as they stepped outside their compound in Antrim to collect a pizza from two delivery men. Two other soldiers and two civilians were wounded when more than 60 shots were fired from a car at the servicemen, who were wearing desert fatigues and were due to be deployed to Afghanistan the next day. But today, Judge Gordon Kerr QC sentenced McGlinchey, also known as Marian Price, to one year suspended for three years. McGlinchey, who also pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting a masked man who read out pro-violence propaganda in 2011, was released early from her jail term after seven years. A lawyer for the republican, from . Stockmans Avenue in west Belfast, claimed another jail term would . exacerbate her chronic physical and mental health problems. She was sentenced to 12 months for providing the phone in Antrim and nine months, to run concurrently, for hosting a dissident speech promoting attacks on the police at a 2011 rally in Londonderry. Health: A lawyer said another jail term would exacerbate McGlinchey's health problems. Here she is seen with husband Jerry. The republican spent the latter half of her two-year sentence from 2011 in a mental health unit . Part of her sentence includes nine months for aiding a man promoting violence against police in 2011 . Old Bailey: In 1973, Marian Price (right) was jailed for life for the car bomb which hit the Old Bailey (left) In the wake of the incident in 2011, then-Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson revoked her life sentence release licence, which had been imposed when she was freed. In the latter part of that two-year stint in custody she was held in a hospital mental health unit setting before being re-released by Parole Commissioners on health grounds. Judge Kerr said her deteriorating health was one factor he had considered when suspending the sentence, as well his assessment that McGlinchey posed a low risk of re-offending and the fact that she had served a period of custody in respect of the breach of her licence conditions. Caught: The Price sisters, Dolours (left) and Marian, were arrested at Heathrow airport in 1973 . McGlinchey and her sister Dolours Price were arrested at Heathrow hours after they were involved in placing bombs outside the Old Bailey in 1973. One man died of a heart attack and more than 200 people were injured. Later they both went on hunger strike in their battle to be transferred from jail in  England to Northern Ireland.In the 1990s they became fierce critics of Sinn Féin and its president, Gerry Adams, calling his peace strategy a sell-out.","Marian McGlinchey handed one year suspended for three years for assisting County Antrim bombing in 2009 and giving platform to dissident in 2011 .

BT was accused yesterday of introducing ‘immoral’ and ‘money-grabbing’ price rises that will lead to millions of customers being charged for the 1571 messaging service for the first time. The telecoms giant has introduced landline, broadband and service charges that are expected to generate £245million a year. Most controversially, BT’s 10million customers will have to pay an extra £1.75 a month for the previously free 1571 voicemail service, which allows callers to leave a message. BT's 10million customers will have to pay an extra £1.75 a month for the previously free 1571 voicemail service . Individuals must contact the firm to opt out if they do not want to pay for the service. Monthly phone and broadband packages have gone up by 6.5 per cent, with standard line rental up by 44p or an above-inflation 3.5 per cent to £15.99 a month. BT denies the rises are an attempt to recoup its recent £2.4billion investment in sport broadcasting, including Champions League and Premier League football matches. But David Hickson, of the Fair Telecoms Campaign, said charging customers for a previously free 1571 service was ‘money-grabbing nastiness’ and it was ‘obvious’ that ordinary people were now paying for BT Sport. Monthly phone and broadband packages have gone up by 6.5 per cent . ‘BT will deny it but the timing seems unfortunate,’ he added. ‘Dipping into areas which BT previously felt should be free of charge customers suggests they are desperate to recoup cash.’ Paul Green, a spokesman for Saga, said the rises would hit pensioners and the vulnerable, who rely on landlines, hardest. ‘It is immoral for BT to charge customers for the 1571 service they haven’t purposely asked for and have to opt out of,’ he said. ‘Putting up standing charges will hit elderly customers particularly hard. Older, more vulnerable customers perhaps don’t make as many calls, but those they do make are vital to their social interaction or are made in an emergency. For them, having a landline is also a lifeline.’ He said many older people were on fixed monthly incomes from pensions and savings, which have been hit by low interest rates, and even small rises in bills had a big impact on their finances.","The telecoms giant has introduced landline, broadband and service charge .

A Romanian Big Issue seller, who falsely claimed to be homeless, was jailed today for stealing £50 from the purse of a blind pensioner. Razvan Dumitru, 22, who lives in a £250,000 four-bedroom terraced house, has 15 aliases and six bogus dates of birth and has been offending since he arrived in the UK without a visa as an 11-year-old with his father and five siblings. The father-of-two, of Lower Edmonton, north London, was selling the Big Issue outside a Morrisons supermarket in Sutton on November 30, when the theft occurred. He was jailed today for four months. Razvan Dumitru (left) has been jailed for four months after he stole £50 from blind pensioner Jane Phillips (right) after she stopped to give him some money . Under the old EU rules the job gave him self-employed status, a national insurance number and the right to claim benefits. When 66-year-old Jane Phillips, who recognised his voice, stopped to give him some money he reached into her purse and snatched five £10 notes. A mother with her two children saw what was going on and a male witness noticed the pensioner was distressed. Dumitru denied taking the cash and started packing up, but was detained after a struggle with the man, who was assisted by a member of the store's security staff. Police were called and a sergeant was assisted by two passing off-duty police officers. Dumitru had £23 in cash in his pocket and the five £10 notes hidden between copies of the Big Issue in his bag. The Big Issue seller stole from the blind woman outside this branch of Morrisons in Sutton, Surrey (file picture) He pleaded guilty to theft when he appeared at Croydon Magistrates' Court. Police have said the pensioner was 'over the moon' with the help she received from members of the public and the police and thanked them for their support although the incident has shattered her faith in human nature. She told police she would regularly give the vendor £1 while shopping, but never took a copy of the magazine because she cannot read. Dumitru lives in a £250,000 house in Edmonton, north London, (pictured) Dumitru was remanded in custody to Croydon Crown Court for sentencing, where Judge Barbara Cameron told him: 'You have pleaded guilty to a deeply nasty opportunistic theft in the street from a blind woman. 'The offence was committed out of greed when she kindly tendered to you a £1 coin and then felt you touching her purse, exploiting her vulnerability to take £50. 'This was an appalling and reprehensible crime, committed two days after a suspended prison sentence hanging over you ran out.' Dumitru's lawyer Graham Lloyd told the court: 'Looking at his record it is quite appalling. 'Between the ages of 15 and 17 there are a large number of dishonesty offences and he went into custody for the first time aged 17.' The court heard the defendant had never learned English during his 11 years in the UK or held down a steady job, except earning £280-£500 per month selling the Big Issue. Judge Cameron told Dumitru, who has convictions for burglary, theft and attempted theft: 'You exploited your position of trust as a Big Issue seller, wrecking the reputation of those vendors. 'Your income relies on these nasty opportunistic incidents of theft and you have demonstrated little remorse. 'You have failed to understand a blind woman is highly vulnerable in the street and these offences cause enormous distress and effect the confidence of vulnerable people.' Detective Constable Lee Blunden said:  'At this time of festive cheer and goodwill, it's hard to imagine a less charitable act than stealing from a blind person. 'We would like to thank those members of the public who came forward to help this victim.'","Razvan Dumitru jailed for four months after stealing from blind pensioner .

Defence chiefs have spent £440million on school fees for the children of soldiers and civil servants in four years despite making deep cuts to frontline forces. Taxpayers’ money has been sent sending children to some of the country’s most exclusive schools including Harrow, Eton, Millfield, and Winchester. It is the latest evidence of the perks and allowances funded by the state which have been spared the axe in the age of austerity. Taxpayers money has been used to send children to Eton as part of a fund for forces personnel and Ministry of Defence staff posted overseas . Between 2009 and 2013 more than 23,000 staff claimed for school fees under the Continuity of Education Allowance. The fund is used so that children can stay in education in the same school if their parents are forced to move around the globe as part of their work in the forces. Over four years the Ministry of Defence spent £439,629,000 on the allowance. It includes £3.7million of payments through the Boarding School Allowance (BSA), and covering on average 69 children a year. Parents have to contribute at least 10 per cent towards the fees. MoD civil servants can claim the BSA if they are working abroad and their children aged three to 18 in full time education. The remaining £435.9million of payments was made through a Continuity of Education Allowance (CEA), which is available to forces personnel for children aged eight and over. Parents are expected to contribute 10 per cent towards the boarding school fees. The Ministry of Defence insisted it had made changes to the scheme which had so far saved £16million . The number of people claiming BSA has dipped from 6,020 in 2009-10 to 4,950 last year, while the total cost of CEA also fell from £111.3million to £98.8million. The cost of BSA decreased from £972,260 to £903,289 over the same period, with the number of staff claiming the allowance down from 95 to 70. An MOD Spokesperson said: ‘Service personnel should not be disadvantaged because of their duty and the Continuity of Education Allowance (CEA) makes sure Armed Forces children have continuity of education, regardless of where their parents are posted. ‘It is open to all ranks and we are determined that it should go only to those who really need it. ‘We tightened the regulations criteria in 2011 and 2013 which has resulted in savings of £16m.’ Last month it emerged how British taxpayers are forking out millions of pounds each year so that diplomats can continue to live the high life. It included £14.9million on UK boarding school fees for diplomats’ children,  continuing to pay out long after their parents return from their postings overseas. This is 14 per cent higher than at the last election, because every year the maximum fee that Foreign Office staff are allowed to charge rises well in excess of inflation. The 442 staff enjoying the perk received an average of £33,769 each last year on top of their salary, allowing their children to go to top public schools such as Marlborough, Fettes and Roedean. The UK’s embassies and consulates blew £8.8million on hospitality, allowing ambassadors to enjoy fine wines, good food and lavish parties at our expense. This is 12 per cent higher than at the last election – even though the Coalition has demanded cuts across Whitehall.","Taxpayer pays for children to go to Eton, Harrow and Winchester .

Hundreds of convicted rapists, kidnappers, sex attackers and arsonists have escaped jail sentences, despite government pledges to end ‘soft’ sentences. Of almost 200,000 convictions for serious offences, just 52,000 were jailed and of those only 6,715 were sentenced to more than four years behind bars. Half of arsonists, burglars, sex attackers and people convicted of conspiracy to murder, child abduction and sex with under-13s avoided jail. The Ministry of Justice revealed the figures showing how for some serious offences including child abduction, conspiracy to murder and assault more than half of criminals avoided jail . Among those walking free from court in 2012 were 736 arsonists, 69 rapists, 1,177 people convicted of sex assaults, 2,745 fraudsters, 162 who killed by reckless driving and 77 kidnappers. Only 14 per cent of the 4,659 people convicted of common assault were jailed. Almost 450 were found guilty of a threat or conspiracy to murder, but only 216 were imprisoned.

Only 519 of those convicted of having sex with under-16s were jailed. Labour . questioned whether the reluctance of judges to hand down custodial . sentences was fuelled by the need to save money and limit the prison . population. Fewer than a . quarter (23 per cent) of the 615 convicted of cruelty or neglect of . children and 27 per cent of people who caused death by dangerous driving . were given prison sentences. In . 2012, 1,354 people were convicted of arson, of which 618 were given . immediate custodial sentences, including 135 jailed for more than four . years. The coalition has repeatedly claimed to be ensuring tougher sentences are handed down to criminals. In . October Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'This government is on . the side of people who play by the rules and want to get on. We need to . teach criminals a lesson; you will be punished for your crime.' Tonight Sadiq Khan, Labour’s shadow justice, . told MailOnline: ‘The British public will rightly question why some . people found guilty of very serious and violent crimes are avoiding . going to prison. ‘Victims of crime need confidence that those guilty of these serious crimes are properly punished. ‘There is a concern that one of the reasons for so many non-custodial sentences for serious offences is to save money. ‘For . many of the most heinous offences going to prison is the only . appropriate option to both punish and rehabilitate. This government . needs to get a grip on this, and ensure that dangerous and violent . crimes are properly dealt with.’ And Priti Patel, Tory MP for Witham, said: ‘Once again we see . the criminal justice system letting down victims of serious crimes because the . courts are too soft on paedophiles and other horrendous criminals. ‘The nature of these crimes dictates that the number one . priority is the victims of appalling crimes and keeping them safe. We need . strong deterrents and that means tougher sentences.’ Douglas Carswell , Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘The criminal . justice system is run for the convenience of bureaucrats – not in the interests . of justice. ‘If we had a proper Conservative administration we could be . tackling the problem the way Michael Howard tackled soggy thinking at the heart . of government two decades ago. ‘Unfortunately we’ve got a quad at the heart of this . government who seem to veto anything that looks like proper Conservative . policy.’ Latest figures for the last week of 2013 show all but 1,561 of the 85,953 prison places were filled, with many jails are breaking point. Of the 39,836 convicted of possession of . drugs, only 1,161 or three per cent were sent to prison, along with only . 3,344 of 6,851 convicted drug dealers jailed. A third of the 534 convicted of violent disorder avoided jail, along with a quarter of the 335 kidnappers convicted in the courts. Even among those who are jailed, thousands are given sentences of less than six months . While the majority of convicted rapists were jailed, 69 of the 1,145 convicted kept their freedom along with 13 of the 166 convicted of manslaughter. Even among those who are jailed, many are given soft . sentences of less than six months, including 2,629 burglars, 1,057 fraudsters, . 6,838 convicted of assault and 76 robbers. The figures were released by the Ministry of Justice in response to a parliamentary question. Justice Secretary Mr Grayling said: 'Since 2010 those who break the law are more likely to go to prison for longer and we are continuing to overhaul sentencing to ensure that the toughest sentencing measures are available to the courts. 'I'll take no lessons on being tough on crime from a Labour party that let thousands of criminals out of prison early because they hadn't provided enough places, who let thousands  of offenders off with a slap on the wrist caution instead of proper punishment, and who, to add insult to injury, failed to get any money from prisoners' earnings for their victims. 'Under Labour's watch, reoffending rates simply remained the same, and they had no idea what they were going to do about it.  Our reforms will help criminals away from a life of crime - and help them stay away from it.'","Hundreds who kill by reckless driving or plot murder spared prison in 2012 .

A teaching assistant has escaped jail after sending lewd texts and naked photos of herself to a 14-year-old pupil. Shelley Trinder, 30, sent hundreds of sexually explicit messages to the male student at a school where she worked in Telford, Shropshire, a court heard. She also sent him a series of naked photos - including an image of herself using a sex toy. Spared jail: Shelley Trinder, 30, sent hundreds of sexually explicit messages to a teenage pupil, Shrewsbury Crown Court (pictured) heard. She has been handed a 20-month jail sentence, suspended for two years . The mother of two admitted one charge of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity at Shrewsbury Crown Court on Friday. However, she has now been spared jail after a judge handed her a 20-month sentence, suspended for two years. Trinder began sending Facebook messages to children at the school in 2011, before singling out the teenage boy, the court heard. Contact: Trinder sent the student lewd texts every day, saying she was 'horny' and describing what sexual acts she wanted to do to him (file picture) She then gave the pupil her Blackberry pin number and sent him a topless photo of herself - with only her arms covering her breasts. She later messaged the boy a nude image of the lower half of her body, before sending him a photo of herself using a sex toy. Trinder also sent the student lewd texts every day - saying she was 'horny' and describing what sexual acts she wanted to do to him, the court heard. Raj Punia, prosecuting, said the school had spoken to Trinder about her behaviour in July 2011 after discovering she was chatting to pupils on Facebook. 'She was warned she would be putting her job at risk if she continued,' she said. 'In November it was brought to the attention of the authorities that there were inappropriate activities going on. 'She gave him (teenage boy) the pin number for her Blackberry phone so he could text her for free. 'He . sent her a message saying ""hi"" and instead of ignoring the message or . telling him it was inappropriate to text her, she encouraged this . contact. 'One night in August 2011 she sent him a message saying she was out drinking and said she was ""horny"".' Sentencing Trinder, Judge Robin Onions described her as 'totally unsuited' to a career in teaching. 'The school appears to have acted completely properly and warned her and she just ignored the warnings,' he said. Dismissed: Telford and Wrekin Council (pictured), which employed Trinder, said she was fired in March 2012 . 'He was a remarkably vulnerable pupil and she was clearly sexually attracted to him. 'In many ways this is a classic grooming case, but they did meet and didnâ€™t have sexual contact. 'If there had been any contact, she would have gone into custody and it would have been measured in years. 'This young lady is remarkably immature and totally unsuited to a career in teaching. If she does anything like this again it will be prison.' Trinder has been banned from working with children for life and placed under a sexual offences prevention order for seven years. She has also been handed a two-year supervision order with 10-year notification requirements and a three-month curfew. Speaking after the case, Nigel Newman, a spokesman for Telford and Wrekin Council which employed Trinder, said the teaching assistant was fired in March last year. He said: 'The individual was suspended from her employment with the council as a support assistant in February 2012 as soon as we were made aware of the allegation arising from the incident which led to her being charged by police. 'Following this, disciplinary proceedings were held which resulted in her dismissal from her job with the council in March 2013.'","Shelley Trinder sent lewd texts to student at school in Telford, Shropshire .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:25 EST, 12 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:01 EST, 13 August 2012 . Boeing engineers have successfully demonstrated new technology that enables drones to function like a 'swarm of insects' where they can communicate and carry out tasks in mid-air. In June, engineers and researchers from Johns Hopkins University tested their technology on two ScanEagle drones in Oregon, Boeing revealed. The drone development could lead to lower costs and less risk in military welfare, Boeing said in a statement. Swarm: Boeing engineers and researchers from Johns Hopkins University successfully tested their swarm technology on two ScanEagle drones in Oregon. Seen here is a ScanEagle . Using just a military radio and a laptop, an operator on the ground was able to connect with the autonomous drones instructing them to carry out a mission simultaneously. 'This swarm technology may one day enable warfighters in battle to request and receive time-critical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance information directly from airborne (unmanned aerial vehicles) much sooner than they can from ground control stations today,' Gabriel Santander, Boeing’s program director of advanced autonomous networks, said. 'Swarm network technology has the potential to offer more missions at less risk and lower operating costs,' the statement continues. Boeing revealed the 'swarm' technology at the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International trade show, where robot makers gather to show off their wares. The University of Pennsylvania GRASP Lab have also tested drone 'swarm' technology recently, showing off a network of 20 nano quadrotors flying in synchronized formations. The SWARMS goal is to combine swarm technology with bio-inspired drones to operate 'with little or no direct human supervision' in 'dynamic, resource-constrained, adversarial environments,' the university said. Drone developments: The 'swarm' development has the potential to offer more military missions at less risk and lower operating costs; seen here is a ShadowHawk drone with SWAT team members . Indeed, it is most likely the future of hard-to-detect drone surveillance will mimic nature. Research suggests that the mechanics of insects can be reverse-engineered to design midget machines to scout battlefields and search for victims trapped in rubble. Scientists have taken their inspiration from animals which have evolved over millennia to the perfect conditions for flight. Nano-biomimicry MAV design has long been studied by the Department of Defence, and in 2008 the U.S. government's military research agency - DARPA - conducted a symposium discussing 'bugs, bots, borgs and bio-weapons.' The same year, the US Air Force unveiled insect-sized spies 'as tiny as bumblebees' that could not be detected and would be able to fly into buildings to 'photograph, record, and even attack insurgents and terrorists.' Around the same time the Air Force also unveiled what it called 'lethal mini-drones' based on Leonardo da Vinci's blueprints for his Ornithopter flying machine, and claimed they would be ready for roll out by 2015.","Drone development could lead to lower costs and less risk in military warfare .

A German man who masqueraded as an Army general choked his elderly wife to death, searched online for escape plans and claimed to be entitled to part of the socialite's estate even though she had disinherited him, a prosecutor said at the man's murder trial. But Albrecht Muth's lawyer said during opening statements on Tuesday that his client is innocent and that prosecutors have no evidence linking him to the death of the 91-year-old victim. Charged with first-degree murder, Muth could face life in prison if convicted. Victim: German socialite Viola Drath was found beaten and strangled to death . ‘Albrecht Muth didn't kill his wife. The government has their theory but that's all it is - a theory,’ attorney Craig Hickein said. ‘And they can't prove that he did it because he didn't.’ Muth, 49, is standing trial two and a half years after Viola Drath, a German journalist and playwright, was found strangled and fatally beaten in the couple's row home in Washington's posh Georgetown neighborhood. Accused: Muth is charged with first-degree murder and could face life in prison if convicted . The death brought an end to a marriage marred by Muth's angry outbursts, occasional acts of violence and side relationships he had with other men, prosecutor Glenn Kirschner said. Muth pleaded guilty to assaulting Drath in 1992. She alleged in 2006 that he had attacked her during an argument, and a computer repairman recalled seeing him shove her and curse at her during a visit to their home months before the death, Kirschner told the jury. ‘This murder was a very long time coming,’ he told jurors in D.C. Superior Court. The unusual relationship - the couple wed in 1990 - united a socialite well-known in diplomatic and political circles with a fellow expatriate nearly half a century younger. Muth latched onto Drath's social connections, inventing various personas for himself - including false claims of being a brigadier general in the Iraqi army. He was known to stroll the neighborhood in a purchased military-style uniform. Drath's daughter, Fran Drath, testified Tuesday that Muth, curiously, was wearing an eye patch when she met him. Those eccentricities continued even after Muth's arrest. His self-imposed bouts of starvation for what he says are religious reasons have resulted in prolonged hospital stays and his absence from the trial. He also fought unsuccessfully to wear a military-style uniform to court and to subpoena former CIA director David Petraeus as a potential witness. On the morning of August 12, 2011, Muth called police to report having found his wife dead in a third-floor bathroom of their home. There were no signs of forced entry to the home during the overnight hours when Drath is believed to have been killed, and a neighbor reported having heard a faint cry and a man's laugh, Kirschner told the jury. Detectives who examined Muth's laptop computer after Drath's death found Google searches for ‘crossing the Canadian border,’ extradition arrangements with Mexico and flights to Iceland, Kirschner said. Muth was arrested several days later, after detectives identified him as their suspect. Muth alerted Fran Drath to her mother's death in what she described as a staccato, passionless voice, insinuating that she had died after a fall. Chic home: The investigation began after Muth reported finding 91-year-old Viola Drath's beaten and stabbed body in the bathroom of the couple's home in chic Georgetown, where for years they hosted dinner parties for notable Washingtonians . Then he presented her with a type-written amendment to her will - with spaces for both his signature and his wife's - stating that he was entitled to up to $200,000 from her estate upon her death. In reality, Drath had specifically disinherited Muth in a will that had been executed months earlier, prosecutors say. ‘It's clumsy. It's callous. It's calculated. It's motive for murder,’ Kirschner said of the bogus codicil. The prosecutor showed Fran Drath a copy of the document Tuesday and asked her about a signature purported to be from mother on the piece of paper. ‘It doesn't look right,’ she said. But on cross-examination, Dana Page, one of Muth's defense lawyers, suggested that the relationship was far closer than her daughter had said. Page noted that the couple had affectionate nicknames for each other, threw parties with each other and encouraged each other's eccentricities, such as when Muth decided to change his name to Count Albi. ‘They were co-conspirators in all of this,’ Page said. Hickein, Muth's public defender, said there was no DNA link to the killing. He pointed out that Muth called police on his own and agreed to extensive interviews with detectives. ‘Albrecht Muth didn't flee. He didn't hide. He didn't need to,’ Hickein said. Muth, though absent from the trial, is able to follow the proceedings though an electronic hookup in court. He has been fasting intermittently, and doctors say he is too frail to be brought to court. A judge earlier ruled that Muth, who has resisted multiple urgings to resume eating and restore his health, was intentionally making himself unavailable and that the trial could proceed without him.","Albrecht Muth, 49, is accused of murdering Viola Drath in their DC home .

Independent coffee shops in Washington are biting back against the monolithic power of Starbucks by releasing a 'disloyalty card' that encourages people to seek their caffeine fix elsewhere. Purchasers of a a 'DC Disloyal' card are encouraged to visit all six participating shops as part of a 'coffee adventure'. At each outlet they receive a stamp with their coffee - similar to the coffee giant's loyalty cards - and once the card is completed, their rejection of blind routine will earn them a free beverage at the shop they liked the most. Brewing up discontent: Washington independent coffee stores have launched a 'disloyalty card' that encourages coffee drinkers to travel to one of six independent stores . Dawn Shanks, a barista at Peregrine Espresso (centre unit) in Washington, is behind 'DC Disloyal' 'The card is a fun way to get baristas and customers talking with each other,' Dawn Shanks, a Peregrine Espresso barista who devised the program with coworker Christy Pelton, told the Washington Post. The pair worked with five other locally-owned coffee shops and drew inspiration from similar programmes in Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Atlanta. 'It also reflects the connection all the individual shops have with one another - the coffee community is a supportive and close-knit group,' Shanks added. Simmering rebellion: The scheme riffs on multinational chain Starbucks' loyalty card scheme . So far 500 of the cards have been printed, with a second printing planned soon. 'DC Disloyal' is not the first time independent coffee shops have challenged the Starbucks supremacy. In December, a Dallas cafe started accepting Starbucks gift cards to raise awareness. Last month Starbucks released a limited-edition rose gold gift card for $450. So keen were the followers of the multinational corporation to get one they sold out in only six seconds. Some shoppers snapped them up and immediately sold them on eBay for thousands of dollars to desperate Starbucks disciples.","'DC Disloyal' actively encourages coffee drinkers to seek out rival stores .

He may be a student again but Prince William was not going to let his sartorial standards slide as he donned a tailored suit and tie for his first day at Cambridge University. While many students might be content to attend classes in more casual attire, the Prince cut a dashing figure in his navy suit for his 'bespoke' course in agricultural management. Despite picking out his smart apparel, the Duke of Cambridge, 31, showed he has the common touch by travelling to university for his first day by train, arriving back at King's Cross in London yesterday evening. Scroll down for video . Suited and booted: Prince William leaving King's Cross station in his tailored suit and tie after returning on the train from Cambridge this evening . Back in London: The Prince on the concourse outside King's Cross station . Earlier in the day the smiling royal looked unruffled as he arrived to start his 10-week course,  despite criticism from fellow students that he received a 'free pass' place. The Duke was admitted to the prestigious institution for a 'bespoke' course in agricultural management, which will prepare him for when he inherits the Duchy of Cornwall, one of the biggest private estates in the country, from his father. The course is run by Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership, an institution within the university’s School of Technology and has Prince Charles as its patron. The father-of-one commuted by train from King's Cross this morning as began his studies and was met by senior academics and university management. William has faced some anger over the decision to allow him to be admitted with an A, B and C in his A-levels – grades described as mediocre by the university newspaper. Met on arrival: The Duke of Cambridge toured with vice-chancellor Sir Leszek Borysiewicz (left) along with Master of St John's Professor Christopher Dobson (right) and Polly Courtice (centre), director of the Programme for Sustainability Leadership . Fresh start: After a successful spell as a rescue pilot, it appears William is looking to take over his father's Duchy of Cornwall estate . Tour: William was shown the world famous St John's but his learning will take place elsewhere during the 10-week course . Last time around: William on his first day at St Andrews in 2001, where he was dropped off by his father, who is patron of Cambriidge's School of Technology, which his son joined today . Some students claimed William was getting a free pass and said it gave the impression that he was accepted because he was ‘posh and rich’. Cambridge normally requires an A* and two As from would-be undergraduates. But the university pointed out that different admission rules apply for William’s agricultural course, and that he already has a degree, from St Andrews. The Duke is expected to make the 46-minute journey for the course several days a week but will also have access to overnight accommodation in Cambridge. It is understood he travelled to the city in a public carriage, although it was not clear which class of ticket he bought for the journey. William looked relaxed as he toured the college's grounds on a grey and rainy day. The Duke was greeted at St John's College, where some of his tutorials will take place, by vice chancellor Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, along with Master of St John's, Professor Christopher Dobson, and Polly Courtice, director of the Programme for Sustainability Leadership. Student life: These are the lecture rooms for the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership in the city of Cambridge where Prince William is going to be studying agriculture for the next ten weeks . Study time: William will spend his weekdays in these rooms, with executives from firms including BP and Lloyds . William stopped to view a plaque commemorating the Queen's visit to the college in April 2011. The course, which will end in March, has been designed to help him prepare for when he inherits the Duchy of Cornwall estate. The course has been designed specifically for him but will see him study alongside ordinary PhD students in some classes. Professor Ross Anderson, of the . university's Computer Laboratory, told the Cambridge News he and his . colleagues should be free to design courses for those prepared to pay . for it and they should not 'be discriminated against on account of the . circumstances of their birth'.

Prince Charles: B History C French . Prince Harry: B Art D Geography . Prince Edward: C English D History D Politics . Princess Anne: D History E Geography . Prince Andrew took three but results never revealed . He added: 'Whether they have any A-levels at all is no more relevant than the price of tea in China.' During his studies, William will have a . university card allowing him access to shared facilities such as . libraries, bars and refectories. William travelled up to Cambridge in standard class from London. Mr Hardy, chairman of the Young Barristers' Committee of the Bar Council of England & Wales, later added: 'It was certainly a surprise, but he was just like any other passenger. 'It was all very low-key, to be honest. He just seemed to be getting on with his day'. Cambridge University students seemed less excited about the royal arrival. Tim Squirrell, 21, debate editor at the Tab student newspaper, said the reaction from fellow students had been 'mixed at best'. He said: 'Overall I would say students are either mildly aggravated or mildly titillated by the Prince's arrival. 'But ultimately people are starting to see it as a good thing. 'The initial reaction was pretty polarised - some students were excited while others said it was a poor showing for meritocracy in Cambridge. 'But since people have understood that he's not doing an academically selected course, the feeling is much more positive.' Academic record: The Duke started at St Andrews studying Art History before switching to Geography for his BA, during a period where he met his future wife . The Royal will have 20 hours of teaching time . each week, including work in small groups as well as one-to-one tuition . and his own additional reading. He will also go on a series of field trips. He will be taught by academics specialising in geography, land economy and plant sciences. Modules he is expected to study include rural and planning policy, farming and supply chains, site management, agricultural policy and conservation governance. Following the end of his service as an RAF rescue helicopter pilot in Anglesey, William is considering a number of options for public service, Kensington Palace said. Details will be announced when he completes the course.","Prince sported smart suit and burgundy tie for his first day at Cambridge .

Miss Fluker advised her son to go to a hospital last Friday to undergo tests, Bradenton Herald reported. After being unable to reach her son over the weekend, Miss Fluker headed to the Sarasota Suites hotel in Bradenton, where her unwed, childless son called home for the past six years. The 6-foot-5, 330-pound football player was pronounced dead at around 11.15am when Manatee County Sheriff's deputies responded to the inn on North Tamiami Trail.

He . later returned home to Bradenton, got an apartment and went on to play . football at Southeast High School. To support himself, the teen worked . part time at a local grocery store. His . former offensive coach, Dave Marino, recalled how he would bring . Williams home after practice and pay him for mowing his lawn so the teen . could earn some extra money for basic necessities. After . graduating high school, Williams went to Florida State University on a . football scholarship, and he was on the 1999 team that won the national . championship. Sad end: Williams was found dead at the Sarasota Suites hotel in Bradenton, where he had lived for the last six years .

There are 269 low-income areas with no free ATMs inside a 1km (0.6-mile) radius – with half of the most excluded people living in South Wales and the North. Labour MP Frank Field, who advises the Government on combating poverty, said the charges - which  range from 75p to £10 - are ‘a rip-off that makes [payday lender] Wonga look like Santa Claus’. Disproportionately affected: There are 269 low-income areas with no free ATMs within a 1km (0.6-mile) radius - with half of the most excluded people living in South Wales and the North . ‘Getting the poor to pay for the privilege of taking out their own money is a grotesque practice,’ he told The Guardian, which obtained the figures from the Link network, behind Britain's ATMs. Mr Field added that the people who relied on cash machines charging a flat fee were often poor - meaning they were disproportionately affected for taking out small amounts of cash. More than 7million people now rely only on cash for all regular payments - a figure up 500,000 on 2011 - and there are now more than 66,000 cash machines in the UK, reported The Guardian. Britons used cash machines 2.9billion times in 2011 to withdraw a total of more than £190billion. Outraged: Labour MP Frank Field, who advises the Government on combating poverty, said the charges - which range from 75p to £10 - are 'a rip-off that makes Wonga look like Santa Claus' Supermarkets and new companies now process more than half of cash machine transactions - a vastly different picture to the situation a decade ago when banks provided nearly all ATM services.

A spokesman for Link said 900 ATMs had been installed since 2006, when 1,700 low-income areas had no free-use machines within them or within 1km of their centre. The body’s chief executive John Howells told The Guardian:  ‘If lower-income people were forced to use surcharging machines then this would be a clear hardship and not tenable. ‘However, Link's evidence is that this is not the case and most people can access cash on a free basis.’","269 low-income areas with no free ATMs within 1km (0.6-mile) radius .

Quiet time: A prep school leader has claimed that boredom in children is no bad thing and can prepare them for dull moments in adulthood . Boredom in children is no bad thing and can prepare them for dull moments in adulthood, a prep school leader has warned. Cramming children’s schedules with extra-curricular activities could hinder their development and make youngsters manic and anxious. Julie Robinson, the education and training director of the Independent Association of Prep Schools (IAPS), said time should be made for reflection, meditation and calm. ‘It is all too easy for parents to be sucked into a competitive busyness, ensuring that children are constantly occupied and stimulated,’ she told the IAPS magazine. ‘We should not fear boredom however. Quiet, reflective time is just as important as purposeful activity.’ Parents who push their children too hard with extra-curricular activities risk burning them out, but youngsters left to amuse themselves could lose their competitiveness, she added. The former headmistress warned that digital pastimes could not provide children with well-rounded development, and said: ‘Computers are an exciting fact of life now but do bear in mind that human development follows a pattern of phases and stages which has not changed because of the digital revolution. ‘Children need time to develop through tactile play and plenty of movement, developing dexterity. ‘Through making friends and suffering occasional unkindness we develop an understanding of the motives of others and by trial and error we learn effective communication skills. ‘These soft skills are what future employers will look for, and by encouraging explicit analysis of social interaction we will serve today’s children.’ Warning: Former headmistress Julie Robinson warned that digital past-times could not provide children with a well-rounded development . In a message to parents, she concluded: ‘So, above all, try to resist being accidentally drawn into ‘overbearing parenting’ by pre-planning each minute. ‘Children need space and time so that they can develop independence and take risks.’ Justine Roberts, a co-founder of Mumsnet, the parenting website, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Of course there are some tiger mum types who are micromanaging packed improvement schedules for their children, but on Mumsnet, certainly, they are far outweighed by others who share the view that unstructured time is really important. ‘Broadly speaking, our users seem to feel that free playtime gives children room to explore, experiment and learn.’","Prep school leader Julie Robinson said time should be made for calm .

A Florida inmate was executed Tuesday for fatally stabbing a prison guard with a sharpened spoon while on death row for abducting and killing a Miami couple. Askari Abdullah Muhammad, previously known as Thomas Knight, was pronounced dead at 6:45 p.m. Tuesday after a lethal injection at Florida State Prison, the governor's office said. The execution took place in the same prison where Muhammad killed corrections officer Richard Burke in 1980. 'This is where my dad took his last breath,' said the slain guard's daughter, 47-year-old Carolyn Burke Thompson. She was among several family members who witnessed the execution and could be seen crying in the front row as it was carried out. Executed: Askari Abdullah Muhammad was put to death Tuesday for murdering a Florida couple and a prison guard . 'The system finally has worked. I am at peace knowing I don't have to wait any longer. I miss my dad a lot,' she said. Before his execution, Muhammad ate a meal of sweet potato pie, coconut cake, banana nut bread, vanilla ice cream, strawberry-and-butter pecan ice cream and Fritos corn chips — all washed down by a quarter of a bottle of Sprite, according to the website Death Penalty News. Muhammad, 62, was initially condemned to die for the 1974 abduction and killings of Sydney and Lillian Gans of Miami. Tuesday's execution was specifically for Burke's killing. Muhammad was visited by his four sisters Monday and earlier Tuesday by a friend. He declined to make any statement before the sentence was carried out. A small group opposed to the death penalty protested outside the prison. His execution was delayed for so long by numerous appeals and rulings, including a 1987 federal appeals court tossing out his original death sentence because he hadn't been allowed to put character and background witnesses on the stand during the penalty phase. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear his final appeals, but Justice Stephen Breyer said in a dissent he would have granted a stay to hear Muhammad's claims that it may be unconstitutional to execute an inmate after such a long time on death row. Justice: In October 1980, Muhammad thrust a sharpened spoon into the chest of corrections officer Richard Burke, 48 (pictured), because the prison would not let him see his mother . Court documents show that Muhammad fatally stabbed Burke as he was being escorted to the prison shower. The inmate had become upset, the documents say, because he was told he couldn't see a visitor unless he shaved his full beard. The documents added he had been overheard by guards to remark that 'it looks like I'll have to start sticking people.' In the earlier slayings, Muhammad had worked for Gans at a paper bag company before abducting him in the business parking lot with a rifle. He ordered Gans to drive home, pick up his wife and then head to a bank to withdraw $50,000. Inside the bank, Gans asked a manager to alert authorities. Both the FBI and police were able to follow the car for a while, including use of aircraft, but lost track of it for a short time in a rural area of Miami-Dade County. Trial testimony showed that's when Muhammad shot the couple and tried to hide by burying himself, the rifle and the money in mud and weeds. Muhammad was found soon after and arrested. While awaiting trial, he and 10 other inmates escaped from jail, leading to a nationwide manhunt including a top 10 fugitives listing by the FBI. Authorities say Muhammad was involved after his escape in the fatal October 1974 shooting of a liquor store clerk during an armed robbery in Cordele, Ga., that wounded a second clerk. He was never tried in that case. The FBI finally arrested Muhammad on New Year's Eve in 1974 in Florida. Muhammad converted to Islam in prison, changing his name from Knight. During his 1996 resentencing, he cursed at the judge and lawyers and yelled 'Allahu Akbar!' - 'God is great' in Arabic.","Askari Abdullah Muhammad murdered a Florida couple and a prison guard .

A Kansas City woman has pleaded guilty in a long-running case of child abuse involving her 10-year-old daughter, who was found emaciated and locked in a closet in 2012. Jacole Prince, 30, entered the please in Jackson County Circuit Court on Tuesday, the Kansas City Star reported. She has been charged with child abuse, child endangerment and assault and will be sentenced on April 25. Her daughter, identified only as LP, was pulled from a dingy urine-soaked utility closet in June 2012 in a story that shocked the community. Guilty: Jacole Prince, the Kansas City woman whose emaciated 10-year-old daughter was rescued from a locked closet in 2012, has pleaded guilty to felony child abuse, child endangerment and assault charges . According to the probable cause statement, Jacole Prince said she locked her daughter in the closet because she was malnourished and was worried she would get in trouble if someone noticed . Police had responded to a call made to  a child abuse hotline. Officers made their way into the apartment and found a portable crib up against a closet, which it was tied to. They asked if anyone were inside and a child's voice answered 'yes'. The girl weighed just 32 pounds. She told authorities that she hadn't been allowed to eat for days and hadn't attended school since kindergarten. The girl was transported to a Children's Mercy Hospital, where she was diagnosed with multiple skin injuries and malnourishment, according to NBC News. Hospital staff said she had gained just six pounds since she last was at the hospital six years earlier. The girl had been in hospital for 'failing to thrive' in 2006 and it wasn't clear why she had fallen through social services checks. This NBC footage was reportedly taken inside Jacole Prince's Kansas City apartment after her 10-year-old daughter was found locked in a closet in 2012 . Scene: The victim was found inside this Kansas City apartment block . The girl told detectives who interviewed her at the hospital that that she 'does not want to go back home anymore' and she said she gets in trouble 'because she keeps peeing on herself,' according to the probable cause statement. Neighbors said the girl's half-sisters, who were two and eight, were well cared for, but that they hadn't seen the 10-year-old. Other neighbors said they didn't know there was a third child. All three girls were placed in protective custody. The eight-year-old said in an interview she never told anyone that she has another sister and that her mother told her she would get in trouble if she did. According to the probably cause statement, Prince told police she didn't let the girl leave the house because the child is malnourished and she would 'get in trouble if someone saw her'. Prince's former boyfriend, Marcus Benson, was arrested some time after Prince, after authorities found him hiding in the attic of a home in the Kansas City suburb of Independence. Marcus Benson (left), boyfriend of Jacole Prince (right), was arrested a few days after the discovery of Prince's 10-year-old on June 22, 2012. He was found in the attic of a home in the Kansas City suburb of Independence . During an interview with police before he was released, Benson said he didn't live in the apartment. He said he often visited to see the two younger girls, but hadn't seen their half-sister in about a year, according to the probable cause statement. Benson said that when he asked the mother about the 10-year-old, she told him she was with her aunt or in her room because she was in trouble. He said he never knew the mother put the girl in the closet or 'he would have done something about it,' the probable cause statement said. But neighbors said he had been living there for sometime. The 10-year-old victim said her mother and Benson would fight about keeping the girl in the closet because Benson didn't want her there. Benson pleaded guilty to child endangerment and initially was sentenced to five years of probation. Prince, who initially pleaded not guilty, told the judge that she was pleading guilty to the assault and child abuse charges because the strength of the stateâ€™s case was so strong a jury would convict her anyway.","Jacole Prince, 30, has pleaded guilty to charges of child abuse relating to the discovery of her emaciated 10-year-old daughter in June 2012 .

A business tycoon who bills himself as China's No. 1 philanthropist told reporters in New York on Tuesday that he has brought two women to the U.S. to undergo surgery for disfiguring burns they suffered when they set themselves on fire during a protest in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 2001. Chen Guangbiao, who made his fortune in recycling and renewable resources, introduced the two women to U.S. and Chinese reporters at an unorthodox and sometimes tense news conference at a hotel near Central Park. Inside a hotel ballroom, Chen began by singing a song he wrote himself, which included the soaring lyric, 'The whole world will witness my Chinese dream!' 'Chinese dream': Billionaire Chen Guangbiao is paying for two women to undergo surgery to fix injuries inflicted when they set themselves on fire . Billionaire: Guangbiao calls himself China's number one philanthropist after making billions in the renewable energy business . Then he talked of having a plan to buy The New York Times. He has said the paper, which has published investigations into the enormous wealth amassed by the relatives of Chinese leaders, should be more 'more authentic and objective' in its coverage of China. He also warned Americans not to trust the government of Japan, which is involved in a territorial dispute with China over several remote islands. Finally, Chen had the two women display their horrific burns, which seared off their hands and left their faces masks of scarred flesh. Protest: Hao Huijun and her daughter Chen Guo, set themselves on fire to protest the Chinese government¿s brutal crackdown on Falun Gong practitioners . Outside in the cold, dozens of practitioners of the Falun Gong spiritual movement picketed the event, saying the two burn victims were propaganda tools of the Chinese government. The women, Hao Huijun and her daughter Chen Guo, were among a group of people who set themselves on fire in the square to protest the Chinese government's brutal crackdown on Falun Gong practitioners. One woman and her 12-year-old daughter died. Months later, the survivors were later paraded before reporters by Chinese authorities to denounce Falun Gong as a cult and say they had been deceived into the suicide attempt. In brief remarks to reporters in New York, Hao and Chen condemned Falun Gong again as a cult. 'Cult': The Chinese government has labeled the Falun Gong religion a cult that coaxed its members into a suicide pact . Some reporters for U.S.-based Chinese media asked the women whether they were actually government plants, who staged the immolations to discredit the movement. 'The self-immolation was our own fault,' Chen said, through a translator. 'We acted on our own behavior.' Guangbiao said he planned to spend more than $2 million on medical care for the women and brought them to New York because doctors here had said they could restore the women to 80 percent of their former appearance.","The two women, Hao Huijun and Chen Guo set themselves on fire to protest government crackdown of practitioners of Falun Gong .

Jerry Sandusky described his career and retirement from Penn State by video link as testimony began on Tuesday in a hearing into whether he can get back the retirement benefits he lost after being convicted of child molestation. The proceeding at the headquarters of the State Employees' Retirement System in Harrisburg involves the pension he earned while working for decades as a Penn State assistant football coach. From a prison in southwestern Pennsylvania, Sandusky began by describing his career at Penn State and talks with school administrators about a possible continuing role with the university around the time of his 1999 retirement. Scroll down for video . Face of evil: Convicted pedophile Jerry Sandusky is seen on video link today as he fights to get his retirement benefits . Sandusky, dressed in a prison jumpsuit, spoke from jail in southwestern Pennsylvania about his career at Penn State . His wife, Dottie, was in the hearing room for a proceeding that could last several days. Sandusky said he decided to retire in 1999 because of an early retirement incentive that would boost his pension. 'It was an opportunity financially to be in a more secure position by retiring at that time,' Sandusky testified. He lost a $4,900-a-month pension in October 2012, the day he was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison for 45 counts of child sexual abuse. The decision also precluded Dottie Sandusky from collecting benefits. The State Employees' Retirement System (SERS) ruled that his convictions for involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and indecent assault fell under Pennsylvania's Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act. Sandusky had opted to participate in the state-sponsored retirement system while at Penn State, which is a 'state-related' university, but he was not a state employee. At the heart of the dispute is whether Sandusky's ties to the university after his retirement, including some payments, made him a 'de facto' Penn State employee while committing the crimes in question. His lawyer has argued he was not and that his employment contract was not renewed after the forfeiture law took effect in 1978 so its terms do not apply to him. Sandusky attorney Charles Benjamin has said Penn State made only six payments to Sandusky between 2000 and 2008, and three of them involved travel costs. The other three were speaking fees of $100, $300 and $1,500. Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, walks with his wife Dottie into court in 2012. She attended the hearing over his pension benefits today . In a December 9 filing, Benjamin also argued that Sandusky did not fit the definition of 'school employee' under the forfeiture law. 'No reported case in the history of Pennsylvania jurisprudence has ever applied a ''de facto'' employee analysis to deny someone his retirement earnings, and SERS should not bow to political pressure and 'mob rule' to deny claimant his retirement earnings,' Benjamin wrote. In recent weeks, there was a dispute over the SERS witness list, which included two former Penn State administrators facing allegations of a criminal cover-up about Sandusky, former athletic director Tim Curley and former vice president Gary Schultz. A SERS lawyer said at the start of the hearing that both men asserted their Fifth Amendment rights not to testify. There is currently no trial date set for Curley and Schultz, who are being prosecuted in the Dauphin County Courthouse, about two blocks from the SERS headquarters. It likely will be several months before the hearing examiner, Michael Bangs, produces his written recommendation to the retirement system board. If the board rules against Sandusky, he may appeal to Commonwealth Court.","From a prison in southwestern Pennsylvania, Sandusky described his career at Penn State .

A woman has been stabbed to death in the street by her drug dealer fiance after telling him she didn't want to get married, police said. Jessica Broussard, 26, who had also struggled with drugs, was close to getting her life back on track when she was stabbed multiple times by Noah Scott, 29, outside his parents' home in Metairie, Louisiana on Saturday as horrified neighbors watched. After the brutal attack, Scott ran back to his parents' home. When police confronted him minutes later, they said he continued to brandish the knife at officers, who shot him dead. Now Broussard's family is trying to come to terms with losing their beloved sister and daughter just as they were finally getting her back after four years of drug problems. Happier times: Jessica Broussard was stabbed to death by her boyfriend, Noah Scott (both pictured), on Saturday night in the street outside his parents' home. When police arrived, they shot him dead . The petite 26-year-old had struggled with heroin and prescription drugs, but after an overdose and another health scare in 2013, she decided to get clean, The Times-Picayune reported. She was hoping to return to her career as a dental assistant. She had previously worked in the field for six years until she developed her addition. But despite her amazing progress, she was still going out with convicted drug dealer, Noah Scott. They had been dating on and off for around a year-and-a-half, her father said. 'She wanted to leave him,' Broussard's best friend, Cassandra Catalanotto, told The Times-Picayune. 'He was very controlling and crazy.' Struggle: Broussard was just getting her life back on track after battling drug addiction for four years, her family said. Scott was a convicted drug dealer who friends described as controlling . Doubts: The couple got engaged on New Year's Eve but on Saturday before he stabbed her to death, Broussard told Scott that she no longer wanted to get married . Broussard's family were not fans of Scott, who had pleaded guilty in July to drug possession with the intent to distribute after authorities found him with half a pound of marijuana. Catalanotto also said she believes Scott was abusing her friend, who sometimes had black eyes. So when Scott proposed to her on New Year's Eve, she felt pressured into accepting, the Times-Picayune reported. But when she returned home, she realized she couldn't go ahead with marrying him. She told him her decision on Saturday, family said, but they still agreed to watch the Saints game together that night. After the game, witnesses saw her running from the house, yelling: 'He's trying to stab me! He's trying to stab me!' Col. John Fortunato, a sheriff’s spokesman, told the New Orleans Advocate. Neighbor Mindy Durr told Fox8: 'The girl . was screaming, ""he's stabbing me"", and ended up on my front lawn and he . was over her, continuing to stab her.' Scene: Police swarm the Louisiana street where Scott stabbed her to death in front of neighbors . Killed: Police went to his parents' home, where they say he brandished a knife at officers, who shot him . Durr took her two young . children and ran inside, explaining: 'We . have no idea if he was around the corner, we just didn't know.' In fact, Scott had run back to his parents' house, where he lived. No one else was home at the time of the attack. Another witness said he saw Scott glaring at him through the window and told police officers he was armed. Fortunato said that when deputies arrived at the house, Scott refused to drop the weapon and became aggressive towards officers. 'That's when they fired, but he was told repeatedly to put the knife down,' Fortunato said. Scott was pronounced dead at the scene. See below for video .

Princess Cristina, the daughter of Spain's King Juan Carlos, has been ordered to appear in court to answer questions over alleged tax fraud and money laundering in the latest blow to the royal . family's reputation. Palma de Mallorca court judge Jose Castro subpoenaed the 48-year-old princess to appear on March 8 for questioning . about her partnership with her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, in a firm . called Aizoon.

Suspect: Andrew Scott Boguslawski, 43, was charged with illegally making or possessing an explosive device after four guns and nearly 50 bombs were found in his vehicle during a traffic stop Monday . A man stopped for speeding in central Ohio was charged with illegally making or possessing an explosive device after nearly 50 bombs and four guns were discovered in his vehicle. Andrew Scott Boguslawski, 43, was arrested late New Year's Day on Interstate 70 west of Columbus. Investigators found two pistols, two rifles, 48 explosive devices and tools and materials to make additional explosives. Also inside was a remote detonating device, Assistant Madison County Prosecutor Nick Adkins said. Officials are trying to determine why the man had the cache of weapons and bombs. He is being held on $1million bond pending a court hearing Friday in Madison County. According to the state trooper who stopped him for going 85mph in a 70mph zone, Boguslawski said he had no weapons. However, the officer returned with a ticket and saw the handle of a gun between the man's knees. ‘At that point, he drew his service weapon, held the man there and called for backup,’ said Adkins.Boguslawski told authorities he has an attorney, but none was listed on the court docket. Adkins said a $1million bond set for the defendant reflected the possible risk to the public. Boguslawski was stopped on I-70 in Madison County just before midnight on New Year's Day for going about 15mph over the speed limit. Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper William Davis asked the driver if he had any weapons in his vehicle after spotting a bumper sticker on Boguslawski's car that read: 'If you can read this, you’re in range,' The London Madison-Press reported. The 43-year-old man lied that he was unarmed, but when the trooper returned with his ticket, Boguslawski was clutching a gun with his knees. Tell-tale sign: An Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper asked Boguslawski if he had any weapons on him after spotting a bumper sticker on his car that read: 'If you can read this, you're in range' After additional officers arrived on the scene, Boguslawski's car was searched, yielding an arsenal of two pistols, two rifles, 48 explosives and bomb-making paraphernalia. 'Most concerning to me was that they found a remote detonating device,' said Adkins. According to Adkins, Boguslawski works at a training facility for Navy SEALS in Indiana. At the time of his arrest, the suspect was carrying blueprints for buildings that are part of his workplace. The prosecutor said investigators are trying to determine if Boguslawski has ties to any known terrorist organizations.","Andrew Scott Boguslawski, 43, was arrested New Year's Day on Interstate 70 west of Columbus, Ohio .

Victim: Timothy 'Asti' Davison was shot dead in a highway altercation that investigators now believe was a random act of road rage . Authorities in Pennsylvania on Tuesday warned that the suspect in the road-rage murder of a 28-year-old Maine man over the weekend could strike again if he's not brought to justice soon. Timothy 'Asti' Davison was driving up the East Coast from Florida to Maine when he was fatally shot by a motorist who drove him off the highway early Saturday. Authorities are yet to identify a suspect. 'The acts committed against Mr. Davison were random only to the point of his initial encounter with his assailant,' the Pennsylvania State Police said in a statement Tuesday. 'Beyond that, the acts against him were very deliberate, calculated and violent. With that said, the potential for additional incidents of similar nature is anticipated due to the violent nature of this incident.' When Davison called 911 in Northern Maryland to report the rage-filled motorist, he was being shot at by a trailing vehicle. Davison called from Interstate 81 near Maryland early Saturday to say someone in a pickup truck was firing on him. The call was dropped and he called again, this time having crossed over the border into Pennsylvania. According to police, Davison was forced into a median, disabling his vehicle, before the assailant approached and fired several rounds at him. Scroll down for video . Road rage: Timothy Davison called from Interstate 81 near Maryland early Saturday to say someone in a pickup truck was firing on him just moments before he was forced off the road (pictured) and shot dead . 'I think we can call it a road rage incident,' Pennsylvania state trooper Rob Hicks told The Portland Press Herald. 'At this point we haven’t found anything that would connect the two men.' Police . are not releasing the recordings of the calls, but Mr Hicks said that . Davison indicated that a driving issue- like one person cutting another . off or braking suddenly- may have sparked the problem. The . only clues that the investigators- who have been joined by FBI teams- . are basing their investigation off of are the grainy surveillance . footage and bullet remnants. State police are searching for a Ford . Ranger-style pickup. They say the vehicle may be blue and may have . damage to the driver's side. They say Davison, who was from Poland, Maine, died at a York hospital following the 2.10am attack. Police say the attack occurred on northbound I-81 in Antrim Township, about 10 miles north of Hagerstown, Maryland. According to police reports, Davison . called 911 in Maryland shortly before 2am to report that he was being . pursued by another motorist, but his call was dropped when he crossed . into Pennsylvania. Davison, . by then under fire, reached emergency dispatchers in Franklin County on . the phone, but moments later was forced off the road and shot. The circumstances of the fatal altercation are strikingly similar to those of a shooting that took place just three days earlier in Monaghan Township, Pennsylvania that is just 30 miles away from the scene of Davison's death. Crime scene: the attack occurred on northbound I-81 in Antrim Township, about 10 miles north of Hagerstown, Maryland, as Davison was driving home to Maine after visiting family in Florida . 'I just hope this doesn’t happen to . anyone else. This wasn’t just road rage. This person is obviously . crazy,' the victim's mother Theresa Alloca told The Kennebec Journal. According to Bangor Daily News, . Davison had worked for five years as a pipefitter and foreman at a . Maine-based company co-owned by his father, also name Timothy Davison. The elder Mr Davison told Portland Press Herald that . his son was returning home Saturday after traveling to Florida to visit . relatives for the holidays. He apparently chose Interstate 81 to avoid . traffic. 'He was a great kid,' Mr Davison said of his slain son.

The original controversy started on Harris-Perry's show during what was supposed to be a fun review of the year. Panelists were giving comic captions on photos from key moments of the year when the Romney family photo came up, complete with Mitt holding his baby grandson Kieran. Comedian Dean Obeidallah had said: 'It really sums up the diversity of the . Republican party, the RNC. At the convention, they find the one black . person.' Kieran, pictured with his mother Andelyne, has been adopted by Mitt Romney's son Ben . And actress Pia Glenn added: 'One of these things is not like the others, one of these things just isn't the same.' Although Harris-Perry, who is African-American, did not directly ridicule the baby, she said during her apology on MSNBC that the idea behind the segment was the result of 'poor judgment'. 'Given my own family history I identified with that picture and I intended to say positive and celebratory things,' she said. 'But whatever the intent was, the reality was the segment proceeded in a way that was offensive.' She added: 'My intention was not malicious but I broke the ground rule that families are off limits.' Forrmer Republican governor Sarah . Palin was among those who criticized the show, saying  MSNBC . should be ashamed of itself for allowing the segment to go to air. 'Leftist media hounds are not . expressing an opinion with this attack; they are expressing a prejudice . that would never be accepted if it came from anyone else but the . lib[eral] media,' Palin wrote on her Facebook page in a post . accompanying the photo of the Romney family.

She said: 'I am deeply sorry that we suggested that inter-racial families are in anyway funny or deserving of ridicule.' Harris-Perry responded to her critics, saying she was 'genuinely appreciative of everyone who offered criticisms' and adding: 'I am reminded that our fiercest critics can sometimes be our best teachers.' 'Poor judgment': Harris-Perry apologized for asking guests to comment on the Romney family portrait . Obeidallah has also sought to defend himself in an article on the Daily Beast. He said he had received scores of nasty tweets from people calling him a 'baby-bullying bigot.' 'You may think [my joke was]funny, unfunny, clichÃ©, idiotic, etc. Comedy is subjective,' he wrote. 'But say what you will about my quip, I didn't criticize the Romney family for adopting the baby nor did I mock baby Kieran in any way. Nor would I.

In one disturbing video released by police - for which The Mail Online advises viewer discretion - Michael David Parker, of Hawthorne in Southern California, can be seen backing up his Nissan Maxima before driving straight over his helpless pooch, named Cow Cow, and zooming off. The incident, which occurred about noon on December 28, happened in an alleyway that wasn't at all connected to Parker's home, the Daily Breeze reported. 'He purposefully did it': Police allege Michael David Parker, 45, intentionally ran over and killed his pet dog Cow Cow. The incident was caught on camera and he has been charged with animal cruelty . Evidence: The video first shows Michael David Parker removing something from his trunk, which is suspected to be dog Cow Cow, who then runs out in front of the vehicle . The Nissan sedan then reverses down the alley . Shocking: This moment was captured moments before a defenseless dog was run over, allegedly by its owner . The footage shows Parker pulling up and getting out of his car to retrieve something from his trunk, suspected to be his dog, who was five and a half years old. The dog then runs out into the alley and in front of the car. Park reverses somewhat, before gunning the car straight for Cow Cow, who seems to try and avoid the vehicle before being hit. Parker keeps driving as Cow Cow is left convulsing on the road. A resident found the pint-sized dog lying bloodied and lifeless in the alleyway. Police began investigating but only recently found the camera footage, using it to trace the cars plates. Parker was then arrested on Friday. 'It's shocking,' Hawthorne Police Lt. Scott Swain told the New York Daily News. 'You never expect to see a little animal like that run over and left there to die without the driver even looking back. Surveillance cameras set up on houses in the alley where the dead dog was found had footage of the incident. Here you can see Michael David Parker's car approaching 'Cow Cow', seconds before hitting making impact . This still, taken by surveillance cameras in Hawthorne, show the moment Michael David Parker allegedly ran over his dog Cow Cow . 'It wasn't an accident. 'He purposefully did it.' Parker recently split from his wife, Olga. The dog had been staying with a neutral third party while the couple organized the split. Olga told KTLA that she believes Cow Cow was killed because she refused to give Parker money from their retirement fund. 'If someone would do that to a dog .. what would he do to my kids,' she told the TV network. Police say Parker admits to be in the alley that afternoon but denies intentionally harming the defenseless dog. Parker posted $20,000 bail and was ordered back to court for arraignment on March 25.","Michael David Parker, 45, of Hawthorne, Southern California, was arrested Friday and charged with willful animal cruelty .

Stiff spliff: Barbara Stiff, 79, sold cannabis obtained by her dying daughter and used as 'pain relief' A great-grandmother had been sentenced for drug dealing after Sydney police found 67 grams of cannabis in her suburban home. Barbara Stiff, 79, claimed the drugs had been bought by her dying daughter as pain relief while she lived with her before her passing. Ms Stiff admitted to police she had intended to sell the drugs as she had no use for them after her daughter’s death. Ms Stiff was given a four-month suspended jail sentence when she appeared in Waverley Local Court on Wednesday after pleading guilty to drug supply and dealing with the suspected proceeds of crime. Barrister William Barber told the court that Ms Stiff had allowed her unwell daughter to smoke cannabis in her home when she had lived with her. ‘She was in a great deal of pain and was using cannabis for pain relief,’ he said. According to Ms Stiff, her daughter, who died last year, would obtain cannabis in bulk with other people in a ‘similar position’ in the public housing where they lived, Mr Barber said. Police raided Ms Stiff's unit on June 27 last year and found 67 grams of cannabis in multiple locations around the home. Mr Barber said the drugs had been there for a very long time and Stiff no longer had any use for the cannabis after her daughter's death. During the raid, Sydney police found $295 in Ms Stiff’s wallet, which she admitted was from selling cannabis to six people. Police also found $100 cash in a tin with cannabis split up into five bags, which Ms Stiff admitted that she planned to sell. Cannabis was also found in a bag in a bedroom and another kitchen tin. Magistrate Robbie Williams told the court that while it was not a sophisticated system, there was a clear system of supply. Not-so-menacing dealer: Ms Stiff, from Sydney, said she had no use for the cannabis after her daughter's death so she was selling it on . He said police also found a ‘drug ledger’ at Stiff's house, with names and amounts of money listed. The court was told that Wednesday marked nine months since Stiff's daughter had died. Mr Barber said his client was embarrassed by the case, which had attracted wide media coverage, and that the housing commission was trying to remove her from her unit where she had been for more than 30 years. Stiff received a four-month suspended jail sentence and a four-month good behaviour bond. Outside court, Mr Barber said Stiff had been through a very difficult 12 months and was relieved that the case was over.","Barbara Stiff, 79, admitted to dealing drugs and intending to supply .

Senate Democrats won a squeaker of a victory in a procedural vote aimed at extending unemployment benefits for millions of Americans on Tuesday, as President Barack Obama was preparing to complain that Republicans in the House of Representatives plan to block the measure. The legislative proposal would continue federal jobless benefits for an extra three months, at a cost of $6.4 billion. The 60-37 Senate vote was an unexpected victory for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who managed to attract the support of six Republicans. He hopes to pass the measure by the end of the week. Democrats needed 60 'aye' votes to end debate and authorize a final vote. Tuesday's preliminary roll call was delayed a day to allow a dozen senators to return to Washington amid nationwide air traffic chaos caused by an historic cold weather snap. White House National Economic Council Chairman Gene Sperling told reporters on Monday that the nation faces a 'long-term unemployment crisis' that requires 'emergency' action. That plea came just 17 days after . Obama told reporters in an end-of-year press conference that his administration has done a . remarkably good job putting jobless Americans back to work.

Obama argued for 'common sense' congressional action on Tuesday, a plea aimed at House Republicans who are insisting that $6.4 billion in new unemployment checks should be paid for with budget cuts elsewhere .

Job fairs and hiring events are often mob scenes in the U.S., as a slow economic recovery and economic uncertainty related to Obamacare have hampered hiring nationwide . House .

Obama insisted Tuesday that giving . unemployed Americans three extra months of benefits 'should be the first . order of business in 2014.' 'We need the House of Representatives to be able to vote on it as well,' he said. He was introduced by Katherine Hackett, an unemployed Connecticut woman whose benefit checks, the a White House official said, cover her mortgage payment and health care, leaving little to pay for the rest of her expenses. 'Job loss is devastating, and I am working hard every day to find a position,' she said Tuesday at the White House. 'In the interim, unemployment benefits have been absolutely essential to cover my bare necessities.' Neither the White House nor Hackett identified her profession, but she insisted that she has applied for every opportunity for which she qualifies. Obama argued that at least 1.3 million Americans are waiting for immediate help, and a total of 14 million stand to lose benefits this year. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (L) demanded the end of Obamacare's individual mandate as the price of extending jobless benefits, while Minority Whip John Cornyn (R) called Democrats' test vote a meaningless, symbolic gesture .

'This insurance helps keep food on the table while Dad is sending out resumes,' he said, and 'we know that ""there but for the grace of God go I.""' Senate Republicans who opposed Tuesday's test vote said that without support in the House, Tuesday's initial salvo was merely symbolic. 'It is transparent that this is a political exercise, not a real effort to try to fix the problem,' said Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn. Another Republican, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, hinted in a floor speech that a final vote could face opposition over the Affordable Care Act. He insisted Tuesday that the price of more Republican support would be the elimination of Obamacare's so-called 'individual mandate,' an ultimatum that Democrats rejected as hard-hearted and senseless.

District Judge Todd Baugh said on Tuesday his decision had nothing to do . with criticism over his courtroom assertion that the 14-year-old rape . victim appeared 'older than her chronological age'. Baugh later apologized for that and other remarks he made in the . case. He also sought unsuccessfully to impose a longer sentence that the . one-month term he originally handed down. Montana District Judge Todd Baugh: The controversial judge ordered a man who beat his girlfriend to write 'boys do not hit girls' 5,000 times as punishment . The 72-year-old judge is the son of former Washington Redskins . quarterback Sammy Baugh. He says his 30 years on the bench were . rewarding, and he looks forward to spending more time with his five . grandchildren. His retirement plans were first disclosed by Billings television station KTVQ. Baugh set off a public furor in August when he said 14-year-old rape victim Cherice Morales appeared 'older than her chronological age'. Baugh . ordered rapist Stacey Rambold to spend a month in jail because the . teacher had 'suffered enough' and his victim was 'in control'. Teacher Rambold admitted to raping Morales when she was a troubled high school freshman at Billings Senior High School in 2008. She later killed herself weeks before her 17th birthday. Her mother said the attack by Rambold was 'a major factor' in her suicide. While Baugh apologized for his comments, he maintained his sentence was appropriate. He said in August: 'I don't know what I was thinking or trying to say. It was just stupid and wrong. 'What I said is demeaning of all women, not what I believe and irrelevant to the sentencing. My apologies to all my fellow citizens.' Following the judge's ruling, outraged Montanans organized protests outside the courthouse in Billings. The Montana National Organization for Women asked the state to investigate whether Rambold's sentence could be made longer.

Deaths from cancer in U.S. have declined continually over the last 20 years, mostly thanks to adults quitting smoking, earlier diagnosis and better treatment, according new research. The American Cancer Society's annual report, published on Tuesday, show the death rate from the disease fell 20 percent between 1991 to 2010, the latest year for which data is available. But the research also projects that a total of 1,665,540 new cancer cases and 585,720 deaths from the disease will occur in the U.S. this year. That's around 1,604 deaths per day. Quitting pays off: 'A big part of this decrease in mortality is certainly linked to the decrease in cigarette smoking,' said Dr William Oh of New York's Mount Sinai hospital . Dr William Oh, chief of medical oncology at New York's Mount Sinai hospital, explained to AFP that the decline in smoking is a major factor for the lower cancer death rates. 'A big part of this decrease in . mortality is certainly linked to the decrease in cigarette smoking . because we know that lung cancer is such a lethal disease that once you . have it, very often you will die of it,' Oh told AFP. Lung cancer rates began falling in the mid-1980s in men and in the late 1990s in women. According to the report, these 'differences reflect historical patterns in tobacco use, where women began smoking in large numbers about 20 years later than men.' The research confirms that lung . cancer is a lethal killer - more than one out of every four cancer . deaths is due to that disease. Combined . with lung cancer, colon, prostate, and breast cancers are responsible . for almost half of all the deaths for both men and women. Terror: Human breast cancer cells dividing. Even by itself breast cancer is projected to be 29% of the new cancer cases in women in 2014 . Dr Oh said that patients are being diagnosed sooner and cancer treatments are getting better. But the disease continues to survive medical attempts to completely wipe it out. 'One of the key issues around cancer is it is not just one disease. It is truly multiple diseases,' Dr Oh told AFP. 'It . makes it hard to find one drug that will treat every single person with . lung cancer, or one treatment that will work in every single person . with breast cancer.' The American Cancer Society's report analyzes how many deaths have been avoided by the declining cancer mortality rates - around 1.3 million deaths between 1991 to 2010. The research concludes that in men, prostate, lung, and colon cancer will account for about half . of all newly diagnosed cancers in 2014. Prostate cancer alone will account for around one in four male cancer cases. Threat: A colored x-ray of the chest of a 52-year-old female patient with secondary lung cancer. This research confirms that lung cancer is a lethal killer - more than one out of every four cancer deaths is due to that disease . And the report states that in women, the three most common . cancers this year will be breast, lung, and colon. Even by itself breast cancer is projected to be 29 percent of the new cancer cases in women. The most impressive drop in cancer rates is among African-American men between 40 and 49. In this group there was a 55 percent decline in cancer deaths between 1991 and 2010. John Seffrin, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society, said: 'The halving of the risk of cancer death among middle aged black men in just two decades is extraordinary.' Then Seffrin urged caution in analyzing this hopeful figure: 'But it is immediately tempered by the knowledge that death rates are still higher among black men than white men for nearly every major cancer and for all cancers combined.'","Cancer mortality rates have declined continually for the last two decades .

The flamboyant Hall of Famer arrived in the North Korean capital from Beijing with a squad of a dozen former basketball stars including Vin Baker and Cliff Robinson in what Rodman calls ‘basketball diplomacy,’ although U.S. officials have criticized his efforts. ‘It's about trying to connect two countries together in the world, to let people know that: Do you know what?

When everyone one comes together in the Olympics, there's no problems. That's what I'm doing.

The Met Office said heavy showers, some with hail and thunder, would continue to lash parts of Britain today – as statistics showed some of us saw our wettest December in more than half a century. About 6.5 inches (165.1 mm) of rain fell in the South East last month – the most since 1959. Scotland endured its wettest month since records began in 1910, with 11.7 inches (296.1mm).

From more than a mile away you could easily see the tower of St Peter and St Paul church, and even through the driving rain, the ancient stone houses were visible all around it. If only you could get to them. But yesterday, surrounded by flood water up to 10ft deep, this little Somerset village was facing its fourth day as a reluctant island community. On one side of the torrent, spectators gathered at a shoreline that shouldn’t have been a shoreline, gazing in wonder. On the other, it transpired, bored, stranded residents paced the streets, went to each other’s houses for tea or simply sat and waited for help from the mainland. And waited, and waited. Waders on: Paul Harris in the village of Muchelney on the Somerset levels which was cut off by flooding . Yesterday I paddled a canoe to the newly formed Isle of Muchelney (population, 210), which has been virtually cut off from the outside world and is angry that it has had to endure its second Biblical-style flood in a year after nine disaster-free centuries. A small white hatchback was just visible beneath the waves; some ducks landed beside the top of two 30mph signs poking up from what used to be a main road into Muchelney. Not that many homes here are actually underwater. It is lapping at the doorsteps of a few and seeping up through the flagstones, and even yesterday, when the sun came out after a torrential downpour, it revealed that the water level was still creeping up. But the name of the village derives from the Saxon for ‘great island’ – and that’s exactly what Muchelney has become. ‘You just can’t get anywhere,’ said 66-year-old Mervyn Slade, pedalling his bike around the new shoreline. I’ve done a whole circuit and I’ve only covered about a mile and a half. I reckon it will be two weeks before you’ll be able to drive a car out of here.’ Improvised transport: The community was surrounded by flood water up to 10ft deep . Concerns: The water levels in the village are said to be creeping up, despite the fact the sun was out yesterday . Behind him as he spoke, the Saxon and 15th century church was opening its doors as a centre for dropping off free food and provisions. One man arrived by tractor to collect a few supplies; a woman left with some cans of dog food and two bottles of water. ‘Everything we’ve done here we’ve done on our own,’ said Louise, 29, walking two Yorkshire terriers with husband Paul and mother Angela. ‘We’ve been left to fend for ourselves. Apart from the people who dropped off sandbags, we haven’t seen one official here.’ There is widespread criticism locally of the Environment Agency’s flood prevention and water management strategies. Paul told me: ‘When this place was built, monks from the abbey dug the ditches by hand and kept them clear so the water was channelled away. Since then the rivers have become silted up – they haven’t been dredged properly for about 20 years.’ Warning: The sign altering residents to flooding seems to have done little to prevent the disruption . Enclosed: Stone walls surrounding fields and farmland managed to contain the flow of rain water . Nearby, but across a vast swathe of water, Ian and Jane Birrell were among the unlucky ones. Their house was ‘tanked’ after the December  flood – waterproofed on the ground floor – but the wet stuff was still finding a way in yesterday. A baby grand piano that Ian spent £7,000 refurbishing was raised on axle stands in what used to be the lounge. Meanwhile the only music was the sound of electric motors struggling to pump out water as about 2ft of it slopped against stone walls and sandbagged doors. Jane, 60, somehow gave the appearance of chirpiness amid all the chaos, but admitted she had ‘done a lot of crying’ these last few days.What was the name of their house, I asked? She looked briefly out of the window. ‘Watersmeet,’ she said, and smiled. Struggle: Villagers have been left to fend for themselves with most of the surrounding main roads being blocked by rain water . Strong winds: The storm conditions which battered the UK damaged a Victorian shelter in Aberystwyth, Wales . Caution: Around 360 flood warnings or alerts have been put in place for England, Wales and Scotland, with three severe warnings in Dorset .","Muchelney on the Somerset Levels was rendered inaccessible after torrential rain fell onto surrounding fields .

The 85-year-old’s condition sharply deteriorated last week, with doctors reporting a life-threatening collapse of vital organs. Rotstein said Sharon’s two sons remained at his bedside in the Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv. One of Israel’s most famous generals, Sharon left his mark on the region through military invasion, Jewish settlement building on captured land and a shock, unilateral decision to pull Israeli troops and settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005. Sharon was one of Israel's most iconic and controversial figures and his career stretched across Israel's 65-year history. Speaking to reporters yesterday at the hospital, Rotstein said Sharon's life remains in danger and that 'there is a slow and gradual deterioration' in his condition along with 'multi-organ failure'. Test results show Sharon also has a blood infection, Rotstein said. The director refused to provide a prognosis but when asked if Sharon will recover, 'looking at the trend of deterioration, it doesn't give us good signs for the future'. Sharon's family was by his bedside, Rotstein said. Referring to Sharon by his nickname 'Arik,' Rotstein said Sharon 'is fighting like a real fighter, as he did all his life.' As one of Israel's most famous generals, Sharon was known for bold tactics and an occasional refusal to obey orders. Sharon is credited with helping turn . the tide of the 1973 Mideast war when Arab armies launched a surprise . attack on Israel on the solemn fasting day of Yom Kippur, causing large . Israeli casualties. He led an Israeli force across the Suez Canal, trapping part of the Egyptian army and turning the war in Israel's favor. As . a politician, he became known as 'the bulldozer' - a man contemptuous . of his critics while also capable of getting things done. He was elected . prime minister in 2001. In . mid-2005, he directed a unilateral withdrawal of Israeli troops and . settlers from the Gaza Strip, ending a 38-year military control of the . territory. Impact: Mr Sharon, pictured with former US President George W. Bush shortly before his stroke, is one of Israel's most iconic and controversial political figures . It was a shocking turnaround for a man who had been a leading player in building Jewish settlements in captured territories. He . later bolted from his hard-line Likud Party and established the . centrist Kadima Party. It seemed he was on his way to an easy . re-election when he suffered the stroke in January 2006. After . spending months in the Jerusalem hospital where he was initially . treated, Sharon was transferred to the long-term care facility at Tel . Hashomer hospital. He was taken home briefly at one point but was returned several days later to the hospital, where he has been since.","Mr Sharon, 85, has been in a coma for eight years after a stroke in 2006 .

The world's largest maker of computer processors, says its products are now free of minerals from mines held by armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Intel Corporation has become the first major U.S. technology company to make such a claim about its products. The declaration is the fruit of four years of work by the company to determine the sources of four crucial metals widely used in electronics manufacturing: tantalum, tungsten, tin and gold. Computer giant Intel has announced its products are now free of . minerals from mines held by armed groups in the Democratic Republic of . the Congo . Just like blood diamonds - jewels mined in conflict zones and sold to finance a wars and atrocities - there are fears that profits from the processor trade are falling into wrong hands. Eastern Congo is rich in minerals, and economic activity other than mining has been disrupted by nearly two decades of fighting between the government, rogue soldiers and different ethnic groups. There's been widespread concern that foreign purchases of minerals from mines held by armed groups are fueling the conflict, though many experts say the minerals are not the root cause of the fighting. Hell on earth: A Congolese fighter controls workers at a gold mine in Iga Barriere, Ituri region, northeast of Democratic Republic of Congo . Intel CEO Brian Krzanich made the . announcement Monday in a keynote speech ahead of the opening of the . International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. A U.S. law passed in 2010 requires U.S. public companies to report whether their products contain minerals from rebel-held mines in Congo. Compliance is difficult for many electronics manufacturers, since a single product like a cellphone can contain components from hundreds or thousands of suppliers. Intel relies on relatively few suppliers for its chips. Vital resource: Metals such as tantalum, tungsten, tin and gold are widely used in the manufacture of computer chips . There's been concern that the law has amounted to a de facto embargo on minerals exports from an area with millions of people living at a subsistence level. Carolyn Duran, manager of Intel's 'conflict minerals' program said that Intel still buys minerals from the region, as long as it's comfortable the mines are in good hands. 'We are not intending to leave the region behind,' Duran said.","U.S. firm's products free of minerals from mines held by militias in Congo .

An ex-Marine in Southern California jailed in 2012 for smuggling a chrome-plated Iraqi AK-47 into the US and saw his conviction overturned last month has been released. Joel Cleve Miller, 42, won an appeal that said he should have been allowed to present testimony supporting his claim he'd been framed by another Marine. Miller claims fellow soldier Christopher Bruce was having an affair with his former wife Melissa Miller and, when Miller threatened to reveal the adultery, Bruce concocted a scheme to blackmail him. Gaudy gun: Prosecutors at Joel Cleve Miller's trial got the former Marine a two-year jail sentence after claiming he smuggled this chrome-plated AK47 they say belonged to Saddam Hussein's royal guard out of Iraq in 2005 . Freed: Now the 42-year-old Hemmet, California man has been released following an appeals court decision that he should have been allowed to present evidence that he'd been framed . During Miller's four day trial, prosecutors claimed the Marine smuggled the illegal machine gun out of Iraq in 2005 after a two-year tour in the country. Miller testified that the gun actually belonged to Bruce, a married fellow Marine. Miller said that Bruce and his ex-wife were involved and in the military such adultery is considered a crime. But when called to testify, both Melissa Miller and Bruce declined to appear in court, citing their Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate themselves, according to the Press-Enterprise. 'The district court abused its discretion by precluding Miller from calling two witnesses to testify about their alleged extramarital affair,' the appeals court's opinion read. Troubled history? Miller was dishonorably discharged in 2011 for reasons unrelated to the machine gun. He also may have been part of the controversial scout sniper unit that posed in front of a flag that looked similar to the Nazi SS flag . Hot potato: Miller (pictured) claimed his ex-wife was having an affair with a fellow Marine. Miller claimed the gun was actually smuggled by former fellow soldier Christopher Bruce . 'Their testimony about the affair would have corroborated Millerâ€™s testimony and bolstered his defense that he was framed in retaliation for threatening to report the alleged affair to military authorities.' As of Tuesday, there was no word from prosecutors as to whether they would be seeking a retrial. During Miller's original trial, the prosecution claimed that not only was the gun Miller's but that he'd bragged about owning it and even took pictures of himself holding it. According to Miller, it was just one gun among others that Bruce had given to him to hold during some marital issues he was having. The firearm was seized by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives after a 2007 call Melissa Miller made to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service to report her impending divorce from the Marine. She told them she wanted the guns taken away from her home and children. Miller was discharged from the Marines in 2011 for 'bad conduct' unrelated to the firearm. The Marine Corps accused him of making thousands in fraudulent travel claims to a medical facility. He also may have been part of a controversial scout sniper unit that posed in front of a flag that looked similar to the Nazi SS flag . Miller had spent over 20 years in the service.","Joel Cleve Miller of Hemet, California had served nine months of a 2-year sentence when an appeals court ruled to throw out his 2012 conviction last month .

A senior police chief has been removed from his post while claims of his 'inappropriate behaviour' are investigated. Chief Superintendent Darren Williams, Merton Borough Commander in south west London, was suspended yesterday after complaints were brought against him by colleagues. The 47-year-old father of two, a keen boxer, has served with the police force for 26 years and been based in Merton since February 2012. Merton Borough Commander Darren Williams, 47, right, with boxer Tim Witherspoon, has been suspended from his position after colleagues complained of his 'inappropriate behaviour' A Scotland Yard spokesman said today: 'We can confirm that the borough commander of Merton Borough has been suspended from duty on January 7 2014 following the receipt of complaints relating to his conduct. 'This conduct is now under investigation by the directorate of professional standards. The matters were raised by MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) employees, and relate to inappropriate behaviour.' The spokesman said they would not say anything further that might identify the members of police staff who made the complaints. While Ch Supt Williams is suspended, Superintendent David Palmer will act as the borough commander for Merton until the investigation is concluded. The Met spokesman added: 'The MPS expects all officers and staff to maintain the highest standards of conduct. Where they fall short of this standard we will take the most appropriate action.' Ch Supt Williams, who was in the Army before joining the police, writes a weekly letter to the people of his borough in which he tells residents about fitness challenges he does for cancer and servicemen's charities.

A pack of needles – one of which appeared to have been used – was also in the room at the Padang Bay Resort, in East Bali. Ms Bischoff, a nurse, and her 14-year-old daughter fell seriously ill hours after dining at The Buddha Bar and Restaurant on Friday night. The 54-year-old, from Queensland, died while being taken by ambulance to Bali International Medical Clinic in Denpasar. Her daughter passed away at the clinic without knowing her mother was dead. On Tuesday, the family of the Bischoffs won a battle with the Indonesian authorities for the pair’s autopsies to take place in Australia. Relatives believe that both died as a result of fish poisoning, a claim which the Buddha Bar’s management has vehemently denied. The discovery of the medications has thrown fresh doubts over the cause of the deaths, but Richard Day, Professor of Clinical Pharmacology at St Vincent’s Hospital, says the drugs found were common among overseas travellers, describing them as 'standard medicines'. 'There would be a mixture of being cautious and being a health professional, more cautious, in addition to having pre-existing conditions of asthma and migraines,' he said. Arrangements were being made to fly the bodies home at the earliest opportunity, but it could take some time to determine the causes of death, due to the discovery of the medications. 'There are lots of samples from the vomit, the medicines and the drink,' head of Denpasar Police Forensic Laboratory, Agus Budiartha, said. 'Since they're all abroad medicines, from the country where they're from, we might have some difficulties because it's not what's usually used in Indonesia.' It is understood that at 1.15am on Saturday the daughter begged for help from hotel security, saying she and her mother were ill . They dined at The Buddha Bar and Restaurant attached to the resort on Friday night after checking in that afternoon . Indonesian authorities have suggested the mother and daughter died from an allergy and not poisoning, but the family insists the pair did not suffer from allergies. 'We've been told it is fish they've eaten,' Mrs Bischoff's brother-in-law, Kevin Bowe said to the ABC. 'We are sticking to that at the moment. That was the report from DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade).' The resort's hotel manager, Giovanni Bareato, has denied this. 'It's a big fish so we would have eaten the same one,' Mr Bareato told The Australian. 'We haven't fallen ill and I know of no one else who has fallen ill from the food.' The bill for the meal shows the mother and daughter had juices, lemon tea, chicken, pizza and fish . The resort's hotel manager Giovanni Bareato denied the claim of food poisoning . The family is aware that results from overseas autopsies may not be recognised by Indonesia's legal system, but say they aren’t looking for a criminal conviction. 'We want the truth,' Keryn Bischoff, Nolene's sister-in-law, said. 'We want to know if it was an accident, or if it wasn't an accident. Were they poisoned, or was it something else?'

More than half of the witnesses to a brawl outside a nightclub that has been closed down following the fight had criminal records. Essence club in Kingston-upon-Thames, south west London, was forced to close on Monday after a licensing committee meeting said it attracted 'the lowest of the low'. The 11-hour hearing also heard how, when a 30-man brawl took place outside the club in December, over a hundred witnesses to the crime had previous convictions - including murder and sexual assault. The council ordered the club to be shut down immediately - but its owner has 21 days to appeal. Brawl: A club where a violent 30-man brawl took place (pictured) has been forced to close after police found over a hundred witnesses to the fight had criminal records . The fight broke out last year after two groups of party-goers left the venue. During the fight, which was caught on camera by a doorman, some revellers picked up scaffolding poles before using them as weapons. Two men were left with serious head wounds and were in need of hospital treatment. When police rounded up club-goers as witnesses, they found of the 210 they spoke to ‘more than half had criminal convictions.’ Attack: Revellers from two different groups attacked one another with scaffolding (pictured) in the fight which left two in hospital . The hearing was also told it ‘attracts the lowest of the low’. The witnesses' convictions included manslaughter, attempted murder, possession of firearms and ammunition, sexual assault, robbery, burglary, drug dealing, and assault on police. The owner of the club, Franco Lumba, was represented at the meeting by Michael Bromley-Martin QC, who told the hearing the music was to blame for ‘attracting persons involved in gang affiliations’. He said the club could be turned round and that the situation could be fixed if the licence was not revoked, local media reported today. Councillor Stephen Brister, who chaired the meeting of the licensing sub-committee, told Mr Lumba: 'As the licence holder you are responsible for achieving the licensing objectives.' Chief Inspector Gary Taylor of Kingston police said of the brawl in December: 'It’s the biggest act of civil disobedience I’ve ever seen in Kingston. Location: The owner of the Kingston Club (pictured) has 21 days to appeal the decision of the licensing committee . Speaking after the licence was revoked, he said: 'We only take premises to expedited review in extreme circumstances. The right decision was reached.” Kingston police borough commander Glenn Tunstall said 'I am pleased that Kingston’s licensing sub committee recognised the gravity of the disorder that my officers faced at Essence nightclub on the night in question. 'The situation faced by my officers on the early hours of Saturday morning was totally unacceptable and both the residents of Kingston and those who visit our night-time economy have a right to expect better.' According to the club’s website it is Kingston’s 'most exclusive venue...which has single-handedly transformed the nightlife in the town'. It states that tables can be booked providing you guarantee to spend £350 or more. A 75cl bottle of Dom Perignon cost £200, a magnum of Grey Goose vodka cost £265 and a 70cl bottle of Jack Daniels would set you back £120.","Essence nightclub in Kingston-upon-Thames closed down on Monday .

"By . Harry Mount . PUBLISHED: . 19:43 EST, 7 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:33 EST, 8 January 2014 . Daily Mail feature writer Harry Mount emulates P.G.Wodehouse by throwing letters out of his window in the hope that passers-by would drop them in the post box . To find the most trustworthy people in Britain, head for Cornwall and Wales. So I’ve discovered, after carrying out an experiment invented by P.G. Wodehouse a century ago. I left 20 stamped envelopes addressed to my North London flat across the country — on pub tables, in cathedrals and beneath town hall porches — to see if anyone would post them. The results varied enormously according to region. As a born-and-bred Londoner, I’m ashamed to say only two out of the seven letters I left in prominent places in the capital — from the Houses of Parliament to the British Museum — made it home. Neither of the letters I left in Bristol, including one in Bristol Cathedral, were posted. But two out of three of the letters left in Cornwall completed the trip. And only one region had a 100 per cent success record . . . Wales. The further you get from the booming capital — with its soaring house prices, low unemployment and, it seems, a distracted population — the more likely the locals are to walk a few hundred yards to the nearest postbox on behalf of a stranger. Wodehouse cooked up the idea when he was staying with his parents in their house in Royal Crescent, Cheltenham, where they lived from 1902 until 1921. It was while watching the cricket at Cheltenham in 1913 that he was taken by the name of a Warwickshire bowler called Percy Jeeves, and the comic writer’s greatest creations, Jeeves and Wooster, were born. It was also while staying in Cheltenham that Wodehouse came up with another brilliant comic invention. He was so convinced by the good character of the British people that he never bothered posting his letters. Instead, he stamped and addressed them, and simply flung them out of the window of the house, in the heart of the pretty Gloucestershire spa town. ‘Someone always picks it up,’ Wodehouse said. ‘And it saves me going down four flights of stairs every time I want to mail a letter.’ Harry left 20 stamped envelopes addressed to my North London flat across the country - on pub tables, in cathedrals and beneath town hall porches - to see if anyone would post them . Last month, a local Cheltenham paper, the Gloucestershire Echo, revived Wodehouse’s theory to see whether it had passed the test of time. He would have been delighted to see how honest Cheltenham’s residents remain. Of the 18 letters left — in phone boxes, on window ledges and bins, in bus stops and on benches, cafe and pub tables — 15 were posted and delivered to the newspaper. That’s a success rate of 83 per cent. Extending the Wodehouse experiment around the country, I have to report more disappointing results. Of the 20 letters I left, nine were returned — or 45 per cent of the total, with that percentage soaring the closer that you got to Britain’s western extremities. I began in London, on Millbank, in the shadow of the Houses of Parliament. I left the letter on the window ledge of a building next to the hallowed home of British democracy. It is no ordinary building — it is home to the political studios of Sky News and the BBC. Every day,  dozens of journalists, MPs and peers whizz through its revolving doors to broadcast their views to the nation. Who could poss-ibly be more trustworthy than politicians and the BBC? Yes, of course, that’s a rhetorical question. Letter number one never arrived. Thank God — literally — for the fate of letter number two. I left this one outside Westminster Abbey’s Great West Door, in the shadow of the Abbey’s gift shop. As good as gold, a saintly Dean of Westminster or passing tourist popped it in the nearest letterbox. Another letter, left by a friend outside a bakery in North London’s Brent Cross shopping centre, also made the short trip to my house. Otherwise, I’m afraid, my native London behaved in a less than ideal way. The results varied enormously according to region. Only two out of the seven letters I left in prominent places in the capital ¿ from the Houses of Parliament to the British Museum ¿ made it home . The letter left on a table outside the Museum Tavern, the pub opposite the world-renowned  British Museum? It never arrived. Neither did the one left beneath  Admiralty Arch, at the other end of the Mall from Buckingham Palace. Nor did the one left in the shelter  of the porch of St Martin-in- the-Fields, the stately church  overlooking Trafalgar Square. On New Year’s Day, my nephew left me a letter in the cafe in the Upper Tier of the East Stand at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium during their 2-0 win over Cardiff. A great day for Arsenal fans — not such a great one for the trust-worthiness of the British people. It hasn’t made the two-mile journey to my Kentish Town flat. I headed out of London, away from the frantic, dog-eat-dog world of the capital. First, I left a letter outside the gates of the Senate House in Cambridge, where degree ceremonies are held for the university’s students. It turns out Cambridge isn’t just one of Britain’s cleverest cities — it’s also one of the friendliest. The letter came through  my letterbox a few days later, with  a nice inscription on its back  in capital letters: ‘FOUND ON  CAMBRIDGE STREET!’ Extending the Wodehouse experiment around the country, Harry reported more disappointing results. Of 20 letters left, nine were returned ¿ or 45 per cent of the total, with that percentage soaring the closer that you got to Britain's western extremities . Taking the train a little further north, I didn’t fare so well in the enchanting cathedral city of Ely. I left my letter there in the southern porch of the cathedral, by the remains of the old cloisters. Nothing came back. However, moving north into Lincolnshire, I had another positive result. I left my letter on the outside shelf of the bookshop on Steep Hill, the enchanting ancient street leading up to Lincoln Cathedral. It arrived at my home on January 6. In nearby Newark, things were better still. Here I experienced the quickest of all my deliveries. At midday, I left my letter leaning against a Doric pillar in Newark’s charming 18th-century town hall. By 4.01pm, it had been postmarked by the Royal Mail, and was speeding on its way down south to the mat in my front hall. Cheltenham, home to Wodehouse’s original experiment, didn’t fare too well. I left a letter in the porch of the  town hall — a short stroll from Wodehouse’s parents’ house in Royal Crescent, and an even shorter stroll from the nearest postbox. Nothing came back. P.G. Wodehouse was so convinced by the good character of British people he never bothered posting his letters. Instead, he simply flung them out of the window . Perhaps the residents have grown tired of posting each other’s letters. The two letters I left in Bristol weren’t winners either. I placed one on a monk’s stone seat in the  historical 12th-century chapter house of the cathedral. As far as I know, it’s still there today. The same goes for the letter I left in a phone box overlooking Brunel’s Clifton Suspension Bridge. I know people depend on their mobiles these days but, surely, they still nip into the odd phone box to make the occasional emergency call — if not to post a letter. Then came the staggering, heartening results that restored my faith in the Great British Public. My mother left a letter on the street in Pembroke, just outside Wisebuys grocers. Back it whizzed to my letterbox. A hundred per cent for Wales! Friends of mine travelling through Cornwall over New Year were equipped with letters that must have been impregnated with magic pixie dust. First, they left a letter propped up between the condiments jars on the dining table of the Weavers’ Arms in Bodmin. That came flying back to my house. Another, left on the floor of the old Bodmin Jail, now a tourist site, didn’t make it — perhaps the ghosts of the jail’s former inhabitants nicked it. That stray letter apart, my friends had an excellent record. Another letter left on the streets of Saltash, Cornwall, also came back. Driving home, they dropped a  letter in the car park of an M5  service station in Somerset. That one not only returned, but a kind motorist had also written on  the back: ‘Found this letter  dropped at Sedgemoor Services (M5). Merry Christmas!’ By this stage, my friends were so enriched with goodwill that, when they tried to leave a letter at the Barge Inn in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, where they had been staying, they didn’t stand a chance. The huge-hearted landlady rang them up to ask whether they’d left a letter behind, hidden under some cushions on a sofa. The British Good Samaritan is alive and well, then. But, if you want to find him — or her — go west.","Harry Mount left 20 envelopes addressed to his flat across country .

A parish council has wasted £14,000 of taxpayers' money after barricading a retired couple in their own back garden with a 6ft fence, blocking their route to a public park. Village hall officials erected the wooden barricade in front of the Pearse's garden gate, blocking their access to a nearby piece of public land. But the authority was forced to tear down the wooden fence after losing a three-year legal battle, branded a 'tragic waste of public money' by Mr Pearse. When the couple replaced an old hedge with a fence and gate three years ago, Queen Thorne Parish Council argued the couple had no right to an easement - a right of passage. Michael and Lesley Pearse were forced to take legal action after their local parish council erected a fence in front of their garden gate . Queen Thorne Parish Council in Dorset were forced to remove the fence after the three-year legal battle was settled on the eve of the matter going to court. The Pearses can now access the public park, as they had done for 16 years before the saga began three years ago . But the couple insisted the right of way was written into the deeds of their five-bedroom property, which they bought for £400,000 in 1993. The Dorset council refused to remove the obstruction forcing the Pearses to take legal action. The ensuing three-year battle has cost the council £14,121 in taxpayers' money - nearly twice the authority's annual budget. The matter was finally settled in favour of the couple on the eve of the case going to court. The 6ft by 7ft wooden fence has been removed from the bottom of the Pearse’s garden, giving the couple their access back. The three-year dispute has cost the parish council £14,000 of taxpayers' money, nearly twice its annual budget . Mr Pearse, a 65-year-old retired management consultant, revealed the outcome of the squabble in a message enclosed in Christmas cards sent to his family and friends. He said: 'We are delighted to confirm that Queen Thorne Parish Council have, after imposing nearly three years of painful struggle on us, removed their barricade and returned us to the position we enjoyed before they took their unexplained action. 'In total, they have spent £14,121 on legal fees trying to justify and defend their actions and this would seem to be a tragic waste of public funds especially when realising that the status quo is restored and we are returned to the position we enjoyed before they erected their barricade. 'We believe we are all entitled to ask the parish council why they spent an enormous sum of public money on a pointless exercise and why our annual precept has risen from £8,000 to £20,446 over a two year period, a rise of 256 per cent at a time when the total precept of all the parishes in West Dorset has risen by just 2.7 per cent.' The saga began in 2011 when Mr Pearse, from Nether Compton, near Sherborne, set about replacing a scruffy hedge and gate with a new wooden fence and entrance. The boundary backs on to a public park with a play area that the couple’s grandchildren enjoyed when they visit. He wrote out of courtesy to the parish council to let them know what he was doing, prompting them to order him to close the access point altogether. The couple had used their access to the park for years, since buying their five-bedroom home in Dorset in 1993. Mr Pearse said: 'This would seem to be a tragic waste of public funds especially when realising that the status quo is restored and we are returned to the position we enjoyed before they erected their barricade' They then sent two workmen to erect the barricade which has prevented the Pearses from using the gate. Mr Pearse said: 'We replaced a hedge and field gate with a fence and a small pedestrian gate. 'For some unexplained reason, the council told us we could not have a gate. 'As long ago as July 19, 2012, they wrote to us and admitted we have an easement, that it is still in operation and that it is accessed across our boundary. 'Sadly, they refused to include this unambiguous acceptance in a settlement, instead insisted the easement, explicitly identified in our conveyance, was in their gift. 'The case was prolonged as a result of the council’s refusal to recognise in a settlement the easement granted in the 1968 conveyance.' Roger Dodd, vice chairman of Queen Thorne Parish Council, insisted the officials had acted in the best interests of the parish. He said: 'We are pleased a satisfactory agreement has been reached in relation to the dispute. 'The gateway was erected in a provocative manner and after that negotiations between the two parties failed. 'We never brought the case but having been placed in a difficult position the parish council is pleased to be able to draw a line under the matter without added expense.' Despite physical, photographic and documented evidence to the contrary, Mr Dodd insisted that no barricade had been put up by the council.","Saga began three years ago when Michael and Lesley Pearse replaced an old hedge with a fence and garden gate .

Three police officers in New Hampshire have been placed on paid administrative leave after video emerged which shows one of them slamming a suspect against a wall. Seabrook town manager, Bill Manzi confirmed the men had been suspended and that an investigation had been launched by police chief Lee Bitomske. 'On behalf of the Board of Selectmen and the chief of police in response to the video in question, the town of Seabrook will conduct a comprehensive investigation into the incident,' Manzi said. Scroll Down for Video: . Escorted: The unidentified police Seabrook police and suspect make their way down the hallway of the police station . The video which dates from 2009 surfaced on YouTube on Monday and was apparently posted by the man thrown against the wall. He claims that he has brain injuries from the impact, a permanent lump on the back of his head, chipped teeth and is speaking to a lawyer. The video appears to have come from police cameras inside the station and is dated Nov. 11, 2009. The 3.46 second footage begins with the officers escorting a man not wearing a shirt down the station hallway. Watch the Video Here: . Smash: The shirtless suspect is battered against the wall with brute force by one of the officers as two others look on . Unconscious: The suspect lies on the floor as one of the police officers battles to lift him up and steady him on his feet . Suddenly and without warning, one of the officers rams the suspect into the wall which clearly causes him to lose consciousness. The officer drags the man to his feet and then pulls him out of sight of the camera - but not before one of the other officers pepper sprays the suspect. The names of the officers involved will not be released by Seabrook police and it is unknown why it has taken over 4 years for this footage to be made public. 'I know there will be a lot of folks who will rightfully have opinions about it,' Manzi said of the video to the Union Leader. 'My position is, we need to give the chief adequate time to get to the bottom of it and conduct a fair, thorough and impartial investigation and then at that point we'll be able to say a little bit more.' The YouTube video is entitled 'police brutality in Seabrook Police station' and was posted Monday night by a person using the screen-name of Mike Berg. Get up: The man is so unsteady on his feet that he fails to plant his legs on the ground and stand on his own . What is so funny: One of the officers smiles as the suspect presumably lies on the ground . It quickly received thousands of views and has been shared on various social media Web sites. The identity of the person slammed into the wall in the video has not been confirmed - but is thought to be the poster of the footage. The description of the video is explained as: 'I was taken out and brought in the booking room to call for a ride. 'After calling a ride I was told I could take my phone that I called from and my wallet. 'As soon as I grabbed my wallet from the table the officer with the glasses came at me saying he never told me I could take my stuff and choked me against the wall then tried to grab the wallet from my pocket. Once he got the wallet and my phone this is what happened.' Manzi confirmed the officers in the video are from Seabrook and it was footage from the station. 'In terms of how and why the 2009 video is just coming to light now, I don't have an answer for you,' Manzi said. In addition, the description of the video says that the footage was in the possession of an attorney who disappeared for two years, before the man who posted the video, 'was able to track him down.'

Almost 11 million TV and radio programmes were watched and listened to on the BBC’s iPlayer on New Year’s Day, the highest ever daily viewing figures for the online service. Yesterday, the BBC described 2013 as ‘the year of the tablet’ after its popularity as a Christmas present saw viewing of the iPlayer service on the devices overtake computers for the first time. On Boxing Day there were 2.2m iPlayer requests from tablets, compared to 2.1m from computers. Fees: The BBC may be bringing in £5 charges to use iPlayer to rival Netflix and iTunes . By New Year’s Eve, tablet requests had dropped back to 1.93m, just a fraction behind computer requests at 1.95m. The huge figures for tablet viewing of the iPlayer service on New Year’s Day is a jump of 35 percent on New Year’s Day 2013, when 8.1m used the devices. During the festive period of 2012 tablet usage was typically less than half that of computer viewing on the iPlayer. At present, viewers are not required to pay the £145.50 television licence if they use the iPlayer solely as a catch-up service to see programmes after they have been broadcast. If customers stream programmes live through their computers on iPlayer, they are still required to pay the full fee, regardless of whether or not they have a television. One TV licence per family is required. Last month it was suggested that the BBC is planning to charge up to £5 for its hit programmes as part of an ambitious revamp to challenge online services such as Netflix and iTunes. The BBC said there were 941,000 downloads of the iPlayer mobile and tablet apps over the festive period, from 21 December to New Year’s Day. The Christmas Day edition of Doctor Who was the most popular BBC show on the iPlayer over the festive period, with 1.96m viewing requests. 'Year of the tablet': On Boxing Day there were 2.2m iPlayer requests from tablets, compared to 2.1m from computers . Gangsta Granny, a comedy based on David Walliams’ children’s book, had almost double the number of requests on tablets compared to computers – indicating the popularity of the devices with families. Dan Taylor, head of the BBC iPlayer, said: ‘With new gadgets being at the top of many Christmas wishlists, we see a lot of new devices accessing BBC iPlayer over the holiday period. ‘2013 truly proved to be the year of the tablet and after they were all unwrapped, Boxing Day saw tablet viewing overtake computer viewing for the first time in iPlayer history.’ He added: ‘BBC iPlayer has an important role as a complementary platform for BBC broadcast programmes, especially on Boxing Day and New Year’s Day, when requests on iPlayer really start to peak and you have time to catch-up on the must-watch Christmas programmes.’ The UK has the largest market for tablet sales in Europe, with more than 2.6m devices shipped between July and September 2013, more than the combined total of laptops and desktop PCs. Tablets have grown in popularity since the launch of the first Apple iPad in 2010. Experts believe more people are turning to mobile devices because they are cheaper and lighter. It also allows more people to watch television programmes whilst they are commuting or on holiday.","Yesterday, the BBC described 2013 as ‘the year of the tablet’

Wearing a knitted V-neck jumper, her grey hair arranged in neat curls, she is hardly the likeliest of university students. Yet this bespectacled 58-year-old is Maeve Weber, a student at The School of Oriental and African Studies. And yesterday she became the surprise star of University Challenge after appearing on the BBC2 programme on Monday night and helped turn the show into the most watched programme on the channel. Starter for ten: SOAS student Maeve Weber helped her team to a victorious 240 points versus Reading's 90 . Taking part in the quiz show, which is hosted by Jeremy Paxman, Mrs Weber helped her four-strong team secure a place in the quarter final by answering general and specific knowledge questions. Admittedly she did not get quite as many correct as some of her fellow team members. But that detail appeared not to matter to many of the programme’s 3.13million, who instead fixated by her appearance. Fans of the show celebrated having a ‘granny’ on the programme - despite Mrs Weber having no grandchildren, while  marvelling at her hair. And one wrote on Twitter: ‘Is Weber the sweetest old lady of all time on University Challenge?’ Another posted: ‘Utterly in awe of Weber’s hair,’ while a third appeared to gleefully state: ‘there is actually a granny on University Challenge.’ Mrs Weber, who lives in Hertfordshire with her husband of 35 years, Andrew, 66, has two children - Eleanor and Robin - both of whom have grown up and left home. And no doubt her empty nest will have played some part in Mrs Weber’s decision to enrol at SOAS, where she is reading for a Bachelor of Arts degree in Ancient Near Eastern Studies. To anyone watching University Challenger, which was aired at 8pm on Monday night, it will have been clear that Mrs Weber was the eldest - as well as the only female - on her team. Success: The episode, presented as ever by Jeremy Paxman, was the most watched BBC2 show on Monday . Yet the other contestants were also older than might be expected of university students and the SOAS team had an average age of 34. Their rivals, from Reading University, had an average age of 26. Reading scored 90 points, while SOAS won 240, securing themselves a place in the quarter final. Last night a spokesperson for BBC2 said the channel was unable to comment on the ages of University Challenge contestants due to data protection guidelines. She added that the episode was the most watched programme on the channel for Monday.","Maeve Weber is studying Ancient Near Eastern Studies at SOAS in London .

A surge in the popularity of wood burners is being blamed for spiralling thefts of timber from nature reserves. Managers have been forced to put up signs warning off the householders, who are pinching logs as fuel to heat their homes. Phil Dykes, East Lancashire reserves officer for the Wildlife Trust, said the signs at the reserve in Colne, Lancashire, warned that the areas were being patrolled by police. A surge in the popularity of wood burners is being blamed for spiralling thefts of timber from nature reserves . He said: 'It is a problem. 'At one of the East Lancashire sites, I gathered up wood before Christmas ready to move and we were going to get a donation for it, but when I returned a lot of it had been taken. 'We've also had one incident where a tree was felled and somebody has gone in with a chainsaw and cut bits of it up. Signs have been put up at one reserve, in Colne, Lancashire, warning of police patrols to prevent further thefts . 'Wood burners are popular and also people are looking to save money because of the economic situation, so if they can take wood and save on fuel they will do.' Carol Riley, chairman of the Alkincoats Woodland Nature Reserve Group in Colne, said: 'It's a problem that comes and goes but it is an issue at the moment and we have put signs in place. 'We did wonder whether it was people who thought the wood was there to be taken, but some of the signs have already been ripped down. 'The wood is usually left from when trees are cut down. It helps with the bio-diversity and has environmental benefits, it helps new trees, insects, birds and fungi. 'We think it is probably being stolen by people for use in fires and wood burners, as they are very popular at the moment.' Marcus Whitehead, who owns M Whitehead, a fireplace business in Ribchester, said over the past five years, there had been a shift towards more people having wood burners installed. He said: 'People have been looking to make the switch because they see it as a cheaper resource. 'People like having them because they give off a homely vibe. 'I would say there has definitely been a shift towards them.

Global problem: Kent Police  arrested 2,000 criminal suspects from 100 different countries in just 12 months . The figures show that 13 per cent of those arrested and charged last year were born abroad. And six per cent of the total arrested were from Eastern Europe, including 230 Lithuanians, 213 Poles, 208 Romanians, 162 Slovaks and 79 Czechs. Polish nationals have been the largest non-UK community in Kent for many years, with the latest census, carried out in 2011, revealing there were 10,357 Polish people in the county. Influx: It has been predicted that as many as 50,000 people from Romania and Bulgaria will head to the UK every year to live and work after restrictions were lifted earlier this month.

French authorities are investigating whether the safety release on Michael Schumacher's ski bindings failed causing the horrific crash that has left the Formula 1 star fighting for his life. Schumacher, 45, has shown 'slight improvement' according to medics treating him in hospital in Grenoble, France, but remains in a critical but stable condition. The seven times world champion driver has been in an induced coma since suffering critical injuries after hitting his head on a rock while skiing with his son in the Alps last Sunday week. Mechanical failure? Investigators are probing the theory that the bindings attaching Micaheal Schumacher's boots to his skis may have failed causing him to crash and hit his head on a rock . Investigators are now probing the theory that the safety release mechanism on Schumacher's bindings, which attach the skis to the boots, may have failed. The bindings are designed with a mechanism that automatically releases the boots from the skis in the event of a crash in order to prevent a skier's legs being twisted by the skis as they tumble down a slope. Critical: If Schumacher's bindings failed it could have meant his skis were release unnecessarily causing him to crash . If the safety release failed it could have meant Schumacher's skis were released uneccesarily, causing him to lose control and hit a rock. Prosecutors are also focusing on Schumacher's speed when he fell on a small off-piste section between two relatively gentle ski runs. Earlier this week Schumacher’s agent Sabine Kehm  denied reports her client had been speeding after allegations were made that he was doing at least 37mph. She . said: 'I think after having spoken with several people who have been . with Michael at this moment, Michael and the group have been skiing on . slopes that were normal slopes. 'Then there is a blue slope and a red slope, and in between there was a part which was deep snow, and Michael went into that.' They are also investigating whether the limits of the ski runs next to the accident site were correctly marked. There have been concerns that the rock was lying close enough to the piste to require some kind of protection or signage. Scene: The Formula 1 ace crashed, hitting his head on a rock on this small off-pise section between the 'Biche' and 'Chamois' ski runs in the French resort of Meribel . Last Friday former F1 driver Philippe . Strieff suggested that Schumacher was out of danger, but this has been . denied by his family and management team. But in a statement on Saturday morning, Ms Kehm said: ‘Michael’s condition remains critical but stable.’ It . comes as French judicial authorities prepare to release their initial . findings into the horror accident, which took place close to the . upmarket resort of Meribel. Patrick Quincy, the Albertville prosecutor, said his team were trying to obtain smartphone footage shot by another skier. A . flight attendant from Essen was filming his girlfriend on the slopes . when he happened to catch what he believes was Schumacher’s fall in the . background. Dangers: Seven time F1 champion Michael Schumacher was more concerned about possible mishaps off the track than dangers on the circuit, he told an interview in 2010 . Concern: Michael Schumacher's wife, Corinna, arrives at the Grenoble hospital where her husband is being treated after sustaining a head injury during a ski accident in French Alps . Vigil: Michael Schumacher's father Rolf, left, and brother Ralf arrive at Grenoble Hospital, French Alps, on Sunday where the former seven-time Formula One champion is being treated after sustaining a head injury . The 35-year-old witness has claimed he is ready to hand the footage over to the authorities, Der Spiegel reported. An . official spokesman for the Grenoble hospital said last night: ‘We will . not be providing condition details for privacy reasons.’ Yesterday . it emerged that Schumacher made a will to distribute his £750 million . cash, cars and property empire among his wife and two children just . three years before the ski accident which has brought him to the brink . of death. Prosecution: French prosecutors may be preparing to charge the operators of the ski area in Meribel where Michael Schumacher was seriously injured, pictured, after hitting his head on a rock . Back in 2010 he . admitted that he had made a will for the first time, telling a German . magazine: 'Yes, I have made my testament because I am a family man. Michael Schumacher was travelling at 12mph when he crashed, a witness claimed . 'But it is less about Formula One but because of the things that can happen in everyday life.' On Sunday his father Rold and . brother Ralf were among the close family visitors at his bedside in . Grenoble's University Hospital. German media reported that a brain scan on Friday troubled his medical team but he had a quiet weekend. Speculation . is mounting that French prosecutors may be preparing charges against . the operators of the piste where the accident happened. A press conference will be held on . Wednesday at 10am (GMT) in the Alpine town of Albertville, local . prosecutor Patrick Quincy said. Attorney . Maurice Bodecher -  a specialist in the field of ski and criminal law . and formerly Chief Judge of the French of Ski Federation until 2010 - . has been retained by the piste management. If any charges are laid they could pave the way for a multi-million pound lawsuit from the Schumacher family. The . main question, according to German media, is whether the scene of the . accident - full of rocks of the type that Schumacher collided with - was . properly marked. The new focus of the investigation comes as more evidence emerges to suggest speed was not a primary factor in the accident. Schumacher was apparently skiing at just 12mph when he hit a rock under the snow.","Ski bindings may have released unnecessarily causing Schumacher to crash .

From new trainers to gym membership, Britons will spend £2.8billion fighting the flab this January according to new research. More than four in five Brits (82 per cent) will start a health kick this year with two fifths (42 per cent) revealing they'll be focusing on their fitness, according to a study carried out by VoucherCodes.co.uk. Aspiring gym bunnies will splash out £56 on clothing to ensure they look the part while sweating out Christmas excesses on the treadmill. High price to keep fit: Brits will spend a £2.8billion fighting the flab this January . The average gym goer will also spend £76.50 on additional fitness equipment - that's a total of £132.50 per person for getting fit in 2014 on average. More than half of the 2000 Brits surveyed admitted they'll start their health kick by concentrating on their food and alcohol intake. 'Dry January' is set to be bigger than ever with more than a third of Brits (39 per cent) vowing to give up drinking in 2014 - a 28 per cent increase on last year. Not only will this could good for their livers, it will also fatten up their wallet as less money will be spent in the pub and on bottles of wine. Meanwhile, two fifths (45 per cent) will take on a detox plan and a third (31 per cent) will splash out an average of £28.30 on kitchen equipment such as steamers and juicers to help them fulfil their health goals. Willpower: Men are more likely to stick to a health kick according to a study . However, the good intentions don't always last long - just three per cent of Brits will manage to make a permanent change to their lifestyle and nearly a quarter of Brits (23 per cent) will have given up on their new regime by 1st February. Men are more determined about sticking with a healthy plan - 54 per cent of those who take up a fitness regime or diet will still be following it by 1st April - ten per cent more than their female counterparts. Anita Naik, consumer editor of Vouchercodes.co.uk, said there are ways people can get fit without over spending. She advised: 'Whether you're planning to join a gym, sign up to a new class or start a diet it's worth investigating whether you can try before you buy. Nationwide gyms sometimes offer short term passes of 1-5 days so you can see whether a longer membership will work for you. 'Similarly diet providers will often offer introductory discounts so you can see whether a new eating plan fits with your lifestyle. There are even savings to be made on new equipment if you’re planning to work out at home so make sure you check sites like VoucherCodes.co.uk to find out the best deals to suit your resolution.' AVOID EXPENSIVE GYM CONTRACTS Many people will join a gym in January with the best intentions and sign up for a year paying £50+ per month. But what if you find once you join that the gym isn't for you or a change of circumstances affects how often you can go? Avoid getting locked into an expensive contract you don't need by seeing if you can do a free trial first. Also, opt for council-run and basic gyms over their luxurious counterparts where your membership may be spent on decadent decor and wash products. Many gyms today offer pay-as-you-go classes that are also a cheaper and more flexible alternative. BUY BUDGET BRANDS You don't have to spend a fortune on clothing and trainers, especially if you are someone who will give up on your health kick by February. Try websites like eBay and check discount websites for offer codes for sports shops. Supermarkets such as Aldi and Sainbury's also now offer sports gear.

"PUBLISHED: . 06:59 EST, 7 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 08:04 EST, 7 January 2014 . Recipes, cures and handy hints from a Victorian housewife have been given a new lease of life on the internet. Over the years, Sarah Matthews, born in 1893, noted down all her recipes for cakes, cures, medicines, furniture polishes and handy hints from days gone by in elegantly-written Victorian handwriting. And she left this treasure trove of handy hints to her granddaughter-in-law Patricia Matthews when she died in 1970. Mrs Matthews used the book (which she's holding in the picture) handed down to her from her husband's grandmother to make cakes for her children and grandchildren - but in 2007 decided she wanted to share Grandma Sarah's legacy with others and publish it - the result was Grandma's Antique Recipes . Among the recipes is her improbable 'cake determined by weight of the egg'. Weigh an egg, then take equal quantities of sugar, butter, rice flour, and vanilla essence, mix and bake. A tablespoon of boiling water added to sponge mix makes lighter sponge cakes. To help green vegetables keep their colour boil in the pan without the lid. The best way of making curdled custard smooth is to stand it in a pan of cold water and beat with an egg whisk until smooth. To prevent skin forming on boiled milk, cover the pan with a plate or saucer, thus saving all the goodness. When making oatmeal porridge or cooking rice, if the pot is greased with lard or butter first it is much easier to clean. Mrs Matthews has since used the book to make cakes for her children and grandchildren - but in 2007 decided she wanted to share Grandma Sarah's legacy with others and make it into a book - Grandma's Antique Recipes. In May a publisher got in touch with her and said they would take the book on. It's currently available on Amazon as a Kindle download. A donation from every book sold is going to The Christie Hospital in Manchester. Grandma Sarah's recipes are all in original imperial measurements, and rely on basic equipment and elbow grease. Favourites include Tennis Cake, Potato Pie, jams and preserves, Simnel Cake, lemonade and ginger wine. Mrs . Matthews said: 'She was the only girl and was born in Salford in 1893 . but moved to Bolton after her mum died. Over the years, while baking and . cooking for her family, she documented all her tips and tricks in her . little recipe book. In May a publisher got in touch with Sarah Matthews and said they would take the book on and it's currently available on Amazon as a Kindle download . Patricia Matthews with the old (right) and new (left) version of Grandma's Antique Recipes . 'When my husband Ronnie and I started courting we would go round to her house and it would always smell of baking. She was a God-fearing, straight-laced person who wouldn't stand for any messing - but she had a wicked sense of humour. 'We will never see the like of this kind of woman ever again.

The summit of Mauna Kea on the Island of Hawaii hosts the world's largest astronomical observatory. The telescopes in the area are operated by astronomers from eleven countries. Their combined light-gathering power is fifteen times greater than that of the Palomar telescope in California. It is also sixty times greater than that of the Hubble Space Telescope. Mauna Kea is unique as an astronomical observing site.  The atmosphere above the mountain is extremely dry -- which is important in measuring infrared and submillimeter radiation from celestial sources. The proportion of clear nights in the area is among the highest in the world. ‘Just as waves of heat coming off . pavement blur out the detail in faraway objects, winds in the atmosphere . blur out fine detail in the stars, galaxies and whatever is being . observed,’ explained Mr Goebel. ‘The . laser is used to track this atmospheric turbulence, and one of the . mirrors in the telescope bends hundreds of times per second in order to . cancel out the blurring.’ Mr Goebel set up his cameras on nights when the weather was clear, the moon was small and when he knew the telescopes would be running the lasers. Astronomers are currently using the lasers to observe the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. The proportion of clear nights in this region is among some of the highest in the world. Using a Canon 5D Mk. II and Rebel XT Mr Goebel took 300 one minute exposures, with an average scene taking about five hours to film.

Mr Goebel set up his cameras on nights when the weather was clear, the moon was small and when he knew the telescopes would be running the lasers . The conditions meant that Mr Goebel often suffered from altitude sickness during filming. ‘I've had my vision fade out, have lost my balance, and have needed to stop to catch my breath while hiking around at night,’ he said. To create motion in the scenes, the student used a home-built rotary table and later edited the images to create the video. Mr Goebel has made several other time-lapse videos in the past, including of Yosemite and Death Valley in California- but this one has proved particuarly popular. 'Time lapse of the night skies is awesome. Telescopes are awesome, too. Throw in some 1-ft-wide lasers, and then it's even better,' he said.

Two women pulled each others hair, scratched and drew blood during a fight outside a court in Belfast. The violent altercation began after the unidentified pair, who are thought to have known each other, clashed outside Laganside Court in the Northern Irish capital.

The older woman then ran over, grabbed her younger opponent and began to pull her hair. She then managed to draw blood before a security guard was forced to drag the pair apart.

Dennis Rodman has lashed out at a CNN anchor after being asked to explain his motivations for his second trip to North Korea. The former NBA star started screaming at New Day anchor Chris Cuomo after the host pressed him about whether or not he would advocate on behalf of imprisoned American Kenneth Bae. While he maintains that the trip is not a political one, Rodman went on to imply that Bae, a missionary, was at fault for his 15-year prison sentence even though the North Korean government has yet to announce the charges against him. Scroll down for video . Angry: Dennis Rodman started yelling during a CNN interview Tuesday morning when pressed about why he felt it was appropriate to go to North Korea in spite of the regime's dictatorship . Looking for answers: CNN anchor Chris Cuomo asked if Rodman was going to advocate on behalf of imprisoned missionary Kenneth Bae and the former basketball player snapped . 'The one thing about politics, Kenneth Bae did one thing. If you understand — if you understand what Kenneth Bae did. Do you understand what he did? In this country?' Rodman said to Cuomo. 'What did he do? You tell me,' Cuomo said. 'You tell me. You tell me. Why is he held captive?' Rodman said, growing visibly agitated. Cuomo and Rodman began speaking over each other and fellow basketball player Chris Smith tried to calm Rodman down but he waved him off, saying 'I would love to speak on this' before deflecting and focusing on the team of former NBA players who traveled to the rogue nation to participate in what they see as a diplomatic sports trip. At one point during the interview, Rodman yelled out at Cuomo, saying: 'I don't give a rats ass what you think!' Group effort: The whole team of nine Americans were seated for the CNN interview but only two spoke . Support: Rodman praised the players that joined him, calling them the 'sole survivors' after others dropped out . 'It's amazing how we strive on negativity. This guy this leader, do [sic] anyone know this guy is only 31 years old?' The eccentric Chicago Bulls star went from praising 'my friend' Kim Jong Un to praising the sacrifices that his fellow Americans have made by traveling with him- 'We've got ten guys here who left their families... do you understand that?' he said at one point. He started off by explaining that the trip is 'not a good idea, the one thing that we're doing- it's a great idea for the world- for the world. People always come down on things I do and it's weird, it's like ""Wow, really?"" You got Michael Jordan, you got LeBron James and they can do all the cool things in the world but me its like why North Korea?' After listing off some of his better-known former NBA stars that traveled with him, Rodman praised the men for being 'the last sole survivors' who agreed to go with him. 'I've had a lot of guys pull out,' he said. Dennis Rodman coaches from court side as North Korean and US basketball players practice in Pyongyang .

Former Knicks star Chris Smith was far calmer during his talking points, saying that the group just saw the trip as another opportunity to use basketball to connect people. 'We're apologetic. We did not know it was going to take this type of negative spin,' Smith said, though at another point he said that 'you'd have to live under a rock not to know the press that was coming'. Rodman's squad - featuring ex-All Stars Kenny Anderson, Cliff Robinson and Vin Baker - will play against a team of North Koreans on Wednesday, which is believed to be Kim's birthday. Upon their Monday arrival in Pyongyang, Rodman told The Associated Press he was glad to be in North Korea for the game, though he said he has gotten death threats for his repeated visits.

I want these guys here to show the world, and speak about North Korea in a great light,’ he said. ‘I hope people will have a different view about North Korea.’ NBA Commissioner David Stern issued a statement Monday night. ‘The NBA is not involved with Mr Rodman's North Korea trip and would not participate or support such a venture without the approval of the U.S. State Department,’ Stern said. ‘Although sports in many instances can be helpful in bridging cultural divides, this is not one of them.’ Rodman is the highest-profile American . to meet Kim since the leader inherited power after his father, Kim Jong .

John Hemstalk, 62, and his first love Cathy Orton, 61, were reunited by Facebook in thesame way as the golden oldies in the hit romantic drama. John was a 14-year-old schoolboy when he first fell head over heels for classmate Cathy. Childhood sweethearts: Cathy Orton and John Hemstalk who fell in love in the school playground almost 50 years ago have finally married after finding each other on Facebook . Cathy was also 14 when she doodled John's name over her school pencil case back in the 1960s. But their puppy love didn't last and a year later she fell for another boy. The couple left school but stayed good friends and John was a guest when local beauty queen Cathy got married in 1972. When John was wed in his twenties the pair lost touch and decided to get on with their lives. But they met again through Facebook 40 years later and have finally tied the knot. Their story echoes the hit comedy drama Last Tango in Halifax starring Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid who play pensioners who meet up through the social networking site after being childhood sweethearts. Love's young dream: The pair, pictured here age 16 and 14, fell in love at school but their puppy love didn't last long . John told how he turned to Facebook three years ago after going through a divorce. He said: 'My daughter told me to get a life - she was a bit worried about me. 'So I joined Facebook hoping to connect with some old pals and two weeks later a message popped up on his screen. ""Is that the John Hemstalk from all those years ago?"" 'My heart stopped.

'I used to doodle his name all over my pencil case in class. But we were only kids and I broke off our romance but he was always in the back of my mind. 'When we met up for the first time in 38 years I knew him straightaway. It was a moment frozen in time. We just looked at each other and hugged and kissed. 'From that meeting I knew I wanted to be with him. Getting married to John after all these years apart is just wonderful - we've come full circle. 'Of course I think: ""What if?""

Gerald Abrahams has been hitting the streets with a sign featuring the words 'Hot brunette wanted for 2014!' in a bid to find romance . He told the Evening Standard: 'I just needed to do something different for 2014. I’ve had enough of internet dating and thought this would be something light-hearted that people might find amusing and bring a smile to their face.' He said his perfect woman would be a brunette with brown eyes and she 'must like dogs and landscapers'. Last week MailOnline reported how, according to research, a 25-year-old Catholic woman who owns a dog, describes herself as thin and drinks alcohol three times a week is more likely to receive the largest number of messages than any other woman on online dating. Her last relationship would have lasted between three and eight years, according to the analysis. Likewise, a single Christian, athletic man with brown hair, who publicly states that he wants children, drinks socially and makes between £60,000-£90,000 a year will receive the most number of messages from women. He would have a masters, law or doctorate degree, and have brown hair.

Tiny diamonds thought to be 4.3billion years old were actually remnants of polishing grit, left when zircon crystals were being prepared for laboratory testing, scientists have found. The gemstones, found in cracks inside the crystals, were believed to have been the oldest known diamonds found in terrestrial rocks when they were first reported on in journal Nature in 2007. However, it has now emerged that the miniscule stones were in fact a paste which had been rubbed into tiny cracks in the zircons, found in Jack Hills, western Australia, when they were cleaned for tests. Tiny diamonds thought to be 4.3billion years old were actually synthetic diamond polishing grit, scientists have found. This image shows the difference between synthetic diamonds and natural diamonds, and a close-up of polishing debris found in ancient zircons from the Jack Hills in Western Australia . Scientists at the University of California, Riverside, realised the error when they used a powerful emission electron microscope to photograph the 'diamonds', according to a study published in the February edition of the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters. They noticed that instead of the rough-edges associated with real diamonds, these were in fact sharp-edged synthetic diamonds found in polishing paste. Authors of the 2007 study, who provided their samples for testing, have agreed with the findings by lead author Larissa Dobrzhinetskaya and UCR research geophysicist Harry Green, according to Live Science. Zircon crystals as old as 4.4billion years were discovered inside 3billion old sedimentary rocks at Jack Hills in the 1980s, which showed evidence of Earth's early continents as the older zircons must have washed into the rock. In 2007 the international team, headed by geochemist Martina Menneken from Germany, reported that diamonds, most of which were only just wider than a human hair and aged between 4.3billion and 3.1billion years, had been found inside the crystals from Jack Hills. The existence of the gemstones was thought to be evidence that a thick continental crust had already formed during the Earth's early years, as the surface would have to be cool enough for diamonds to form. The presence of the diamonds backed up theories surrounding early continental drift, as plate tectonics, which also cause volcanoes, would have created enough pressure for the diamonds to form . Their presence also backed up theories surrounding early continental drift, as plate tectonics would have created enough pressure for the diamonds to form. However, some scientists were suspicious of the findings due to the fact that the zircons had been cleaned using diamond paste, and found it difficult to believe that diamonds with an age range of more than one billion years could have been found within individual zircons. After receiving permission to test the zircons, Professor Dobrzhinetskaya and her team found that the diamonds were more similar to angular synthetic diamonds, rather than a natural form. The crystals were also surrounded by minerals which made up the polishing compound and resin used to clean the zircons. Co-author of the 2007 study, Thorsten Geisler-Wierwille, accepts that polishing paste had found its way into the zircons, but maintains that there could be diamonds embedded in the core of the crystals. However, Professor Green disagrees. 'They can go back to their cache of Jack Hill zircons and make new specimens,' he told Live Science. 'If you're a betting person, I'll make you a bet that they won't find it. There have been an enormous amount of (Jack Hills) zircons analyzed in a bunch of different ways, and no one has ever found diamonds.'","Tiny gemstones were found in cracks inside zircon crystals .

Once the laminated book of dreams, the Argos catalogue has been every child's Christmas companion since it first emerged in the 1970s. A treasure trove of cutting-edge gadgets and must-have toys, it was the bible of the day's popular culture. People would eagerly flick through the synthetic pages with a pen compiling a detailed list of product codes for Father Christmas to reference. Throwback: This 1973 edition of the iconic catalogue is a telling glimpse into the fads of the day, and the nation's tastes. A secure family unit was a key marketing feature . In 2013, the front cover is cleared of smiling children and loving parents to make way for glitzy gadgets and bright colours with an advert for where to do your shopping . 70s prices: Back then, a rowing machine would only set you back £13.95, compared to prices nearing £200 today. The models look like they're having a playful time . Now, exercise is a solitary activity, and the model looks strained; pushed to the limit. Compared to the basic stock in 1976, there are pages of equipment to choose from now . Three decades ago, the toys pages were void of beaming children and shiny colours to inspire their young shoppers. The pictures and toys are simple . Now, children want their own miniature versions of real-life cars like Mini Coopers that they can drive around with a remote control . Nostalgia: Vintage collector Anthony Voz was amazed by the reactions from nostalgic shoppers when he shared the images of this dull-coloured 1976 edition online . 1976 Index: For shoppers desperate to flick straight to bread bins, dress forms, eternity rings, valet stands and typewriters, here are the pages . Children would sift through the wad of cutting-edge toys to note down product codes for Father Christmas. The news that the catalogues are ending was met with uproar . Sign of the times: The Six Million Dollar Man was one of the nation's favourite imports from America, and the figurine was essential for young boys. Ricochet Racers were loved but faulty . When store directors this year announced plans to go digital in the near future, millions of nostalgic shoppers were dismayed. But today, in a wistful tribute to the institution, a collector has unveiled one of the store's first catalogues before the marketing revolution disappears into history. And they offer an incredible glimpse into the ever-changing tastes of British shoppers. In the booklet, found in a carboot sale by vintage collector Anthony Voz, models with Farah Fawcett-flicked locks and glossed lips and men with helmet hair and Adidas tracksuits posed with the 1976 must-haves, from instamatic Kodak cameras to metal typewriters and gas coal-effect fires. Just three decades on, typewriters are vintage collectors items that can cost hundreds. These are as little as £29.95. And a box advertises £1 gift vouchers for a wedding present . Writers today need a laptop, which can cost £399.99 if you're lucky. The curved edges and soft, pastel colours of typewriters have been replaced with harsh edges and sleek black . No house was complete without a record player. The catalogue puts a great deal of emphasis on on manual control of the sound on there £25 machines . Before the advent of iPods and mp3 players, a portable radio was the must-have accessory for young things walking around Britain. The chunky devices were considered lightweight . Dramatic change: With technological advances, stereos can now be all shapes and sizes - usually enormous and dwarfing the sleek little iPhone nestled inside it . The whole booklet is a vision of orange and brown, featuring homes brimming with Ercol furniture and patio sun loungers, complete with bronzed men in blinding white exercise gear. Customers are invited to by state-of-the-art twin turntables on which to play all those early Elton John LPs, listened to through wooden speakers (brown, of course). It was the year of bell-bottom jeans, Rod Stewart, ABBA, and disco. Cassette tapes took off, and people without a walkman strapped to their pocket simply weren't worth the time of day. Alternative and herbal medicines such as acupuncture started moving into Britain and from China as the nation embraced spirituality. Glass eating and star wars action figures also made their debut. 'Super' was the word on the street, where the trendy young things wore jackets inspired by The Fonz from Happy Days. Watches are glistening gold and opulent - compared to today's practical, sleek, black gadgets. Typewriters, adding machines, cassette players and ashtrays are just some of the things that either no longer appear or have a minimal amount of space now dedicated to them. But it is not only gadgets which have changed, as the pictures also show how far the nation's obsession with body image and personal grooming has developed since the 1970s. Whereas the 70s version shows a happy family gathered around the catalogue, the cover of the 2013 edition shows a tablet PC displaying the Argos website and a range of online purchasing options. The contents pages of the old catalogue list just one page of 'Keep Fit equipment', whereas the 2011 version has a staggering 40 pages of various sports gear. And while today's man looks for an electric razor which moisturises his skin as he shaves, a sideburn trimming feature was the USP which attracted the rugged 70s bloke. When it was launched in 1973, Argos revolutionised the way we shopped. Back then — before the computer age, and when there was only one commercial TV channel on which to advertise — the catalogue was a quick and inspiring way to reach customers at home. The original allure of the catalogue was in its aspirational products and fantasy homes — all of which was in your grasp, with a little help from Argos. While browsing the pages at home, you could compare these fabulous homes and the happy families in them with your own living room and life, which suddenly seemed somewhat lacking. Having scanned and uploaded every single page, Mr Voz has shared the images which shed light on the way we used to live. And he was overwhelmed by the response from people who had fond childhood memories of the products featured within. He said: 'The images act as a way to connect with people to discover their stories, their past and their memories. 'For example, people see teddy bears that they owned, or games consoles that they longed to own as a teenager and the catalogues also shed light into how it was to live back then. 'Looking at the catalogues makes people remember parts of their life that they had forgotten. 'It is sad that the catalogues are being phased out but I guess it is a sign of the times. 'In many ways catalogue shopping was a radical approach back in the day and it has slowly been replaced by the web. Vintage collectors now clamour for items like the Halina camera, top right, which went for £3.95 in 1976 and with film would be more than 20 times the price today . Shiny: Glittering colours, swirling patterns and optical zooms are the order of the day today and the page design crams far more information in around the cut-out images . The Highriser bike was at its height of popularity for teenagers to cruise around the streets, advertised by cyclist Hugh Porter, sporting some timely sideburns . Now: Style has been shunned for substance as customers are now given close-up views of the bike's suspension and details of the gear type . Gold: Accessories were glamourous in 1976, and there was never such a thing as too much gold. The layout is reminiscent of a jeweller's store, with simple boxed photos . Multi-purpose: Now, gold is gone. Watches are a practical device that can tell you the date, time, your location, and hydration levels. They resist water and have in-built alarms . The Man-Styler, which sold for £11.95, was a heavy-duty hairdressing kit for those bouffant manes that ABBA and Elton John inspired in the 1970s . Edgy: Grooming has now lost its soft, feathered edge in favour of lasers, bright lights and photoshopped graphics - and prices rocketing past £200 . Playthings: The must-have toys of the day were air hostess dolls and Brownie dolls. There is also the first sign of 'tiny tears' dolls which drink, cry and wet their nappies . The tiny tears toys are still a favourite today, but marketed with an adorable young girl, and a tumult of extra accessories . 'It is all about technology making things even more convenient and easy for the customer now. 'Let's see if it works out as great as the catalogues.' Earlier this year Argos revealed plans to launch six 'digital only' stores which would do away with the traditional catalogue seen at its other 732 outlets in the UK and Ireland. This month the stores attracted controversy after customers reserved items online for instore pick-up, only to find them closed when they arrived.","Vintage collector Anthony Voz today unearthed 1976 catalogue which advertises a 'Man Styler' hair-feathering kit .

And across the UK, it adds up to £500million a year in putting them right, the study by vehicle database HPI found. Four in five used cars are bought with at least one hidden defect, and each fault costs an average of £225 to fix. Second-hand car buyers spend an average £200 on fixing hidden faults within weeks of owning their motor, new figures reveal. (Above, George Cole as dodgy car salesman Arthur Daley in TV's minder) With 2.7million second-hand vehicles sold in a typical year, it means the annual repair bill for faults unknown when a car was bought comes to £486million. The research found one in nine cars with faults costing more than £1,000 to repair. And buyers are invariably bearing the burden when it comes to repairing faults on used cars. Shane Teskey, head of consumer services at HPI, said: 'Last year, 2.7million used cars were sold privately in the UK and Northern Ireland, which could equate to more than £480million spent on faulty cars being repaired. 'Too many used-car buyers are falling foul of dodgy cars from shifty sellers and losing cash on a clunker. 'They should beware of being hoodwinked into parting with their cash without conducting rigorous checks. 'People rarely buy a house without having a survey, so why would they happily buy a car without having it inspected?' The study by vehicle database HPI said: 'Straightforward jobs such as replacing worn tyres could cost £320 on a Ford Focus or similar car and up to £1,800 for a 4X4 BMW X5 or similar' HPI’s research reveals that one in five cars need a repair costing £550 to keep them on the road, leaving buyers significantly out of pocket. The report said: 'Straightforward jobs such as replacing worn tyres could cost £320 on a Ford Focus or similar car and up to £1,800 for a 4X4 BMW X5 or similar. 'All of which goes to show the value of having an independent vehicle inspection conducted before purchase. Mr Teskey said: 'Most people think it’s the older cars that are more prone to having faults, but one in five cars fail their first MOT test at three years old.' Used-cars buyers are advised to avoid viewing a vehicle in the dark and beware cars that look too clean or whose warm engine may be disguising a starting problem. They should also look out for replacement tyres which may be hiding steering or suspension problems and to check the registration and MOT documents for discrepancies.","Many buyers find the faults within weeks of purchasing car .

A British man wanted in connection with a murder in Cambodia is said to have been arrested. Stuart Green, from Eccles, Manchester, is accused of slashing the throat for a local woman at a Phnom Penh hotel. The news of his arrest was reported on an online expatriate forum, which gave details of where 47-year-old Green is said to have been staying after checking out of the hotel where the body of a woman, known locally as Nari, was found. According to a writer using the pseudonym JimmyChina, Stuart was arrested in a guest house located behind an establishment called the Lone Brothers Bikers Bar, used as the headquarters of an expatriate motor cycle club. In broken English, JimmyChina wrote: ‘He will stay long time in prison - not think he will live long inside that place of prison. (sic)' ‘Now you can be happy your fellow countryman found. (sic)' he added . British expatriates writing on the forum made it clear they did not want to be associated with Green, responding that he was no fellow countrymen of theirs. Green had checked into the £12-a-night Bolyna Palace Hotel in Phnom Penh with a Cambodian woman on Christmas Day. A photo, posted on an expatriate forum by a writer using the name Ross, said the woman was named Nari and was 'a nice girl'. Police have so far refused to formally identify the dead woman. He went to the reception desk at around 11pm on December 28, asking for his passport to be returned so he could go to a bank and get money to pay for his room. Even though banks are not open at that time, the passport was returned, Green walked out - and did not come back. The following day a cleaner found the naked body of the young woman under the bed, her throat slashed and a number of other knife wounds in her neck. Expatriates on the online forum has been speculating that Green might have been able to cross a 'loosely-guarded' border into a neighbouring country - most likely Thailand. Others have suggested he is hiding out in a remote 'flophouse' or a village where locals do not know that police are looking for him. Cambodian police said a woman aged about 20 had been found in a room at the Bolyna Palace Hotel . A cleaner found the blood-covered  body of the woman under a bed inside the Cambodian hotel . If the dead woman is indeed Nari, she appears to have been liked by a number of expatriates. One writer commented: 'I didn't know her and I wish she'd had a different lifestyle and life opportunities, but I do hope they capture the bastard who killed her.' A correspondent using the name Chicorytip wrote: 'Yes, that's the girl. She was a bit crazy in a sweet and funny way. She was a good person. 'I remember her bringing her pet rabbit to the White Cobra bar. RIP.' Despite demands from expatriates, Phnom Penh police have still failed to issue a photo of Green.","Stuart Green, from Eccles, Manchester, said to have been arrested .

Bob Crow, the head of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union is believed to pay half the market rate for his taxpayer-subsidised house despite being paid a substantial salary . Well-off council house tenants are to be targeted in the next round of welfare cuts, as official figures show that up to 100,000 have household incomes in excess of £40,000. Ministers said it was 'blatantly unfair' that so many people enjoy taxpayer-subsidised housing despite earning more than enough to rent in the private sector or buy their home. Chancellor George Osborne yesterday identified them as a top target among £12billion of new social security savings that he said were needed after the 2015 general election. Just weeks ago one well-off tenant, transport union boss Bob Crow, insisted he had 'no moral duty' to move out of his taxpayer-subsidised home – despite his £145,000 pay and expenses package. Mr Osborne also suggested the under-25s should be stripped of the right to claim housing benefit so that they have to live with their parents – as many starting out in jobs are forced to. A total of 350,000 people under 25 claim around £1.9billion in housing benefit, though many have children of their own, making cuts controversial. 'I would look at housing benefit for the under-25s when there are many people who can't afford to move out of their home,' Mr Osborne said. Ministers are drawing up plans to introduce means testing so that those on higher incomes are hit with much higher rents if they insist on staying in council homes. Official figures suggest that around 86,000 families live in social housing despite having a gross annual household income of between £40,000 and £50,000, while up to 21,000 have incomes of more than £60,000 a year. Mr Crow, the leader of the RMT union, lives with his family in taxpayer-subsidised social housing in North London. But he recently claimed he was being victimised and denied there was any ethical obligation for him to use his £145,000 package to buy or rent a property in the private sector. 'I have no moral duty at all,' he said. 'I was born in a council house – as far as I'm concerned I will die in one.' RMT Union boss Bob Crow's home in Woodford Green . Housing minister Kris Hopkins said: 'For too long, those on council waiting lists have watched helplessly as very high-earning social tenants continue to live in taxpayer-subsidised homes. 'We want to call time on this  blatant unfairness. If the tenants want to continue using this precious national resource, they will pay for  the privilege.'","Ministers said subsidised housing for the rich was 'blatantly unfair'

Dr Backardjiev had also delivered Coats' daughter's baby just one month . prior so she was familiar with him even before Ms Melancon went into . delivery on December 28. From the beginning both she and . Melancon told him they wanted to do a c-section because of the mother's . petite frame and the baby's large size, but he insisted on trying a . natural birth because a c-section would leave a scar, ABC News reported. As each . hour passed of her 18 hour labor, the family continued to ask for a . c-section but Dr Backardjiev kept pushing it off just a little while . longer. Devastating: Baby Olivia was kept on life support for five days before she finally died . Heartbroken: Allen Coats and Rachel Melancon with baby Olivia whose skull was crushed during an attempted forceps delivery . In a forceps delivery a metal instrument, shaped like salad tongs, is clamped around the baby's head. They are used to either guide the baby out the birth canal or, if the baby is facing the wrong way, to rotate the baby. The . mother is generally given an episiotomy - an incision from the vagina . to the anus - as there is an increased likelihood of tearing. It . is considered a risky delivery, with the Mayo Clinic reminding . expectant mothers that generally when a forceps delivery is recommended a . C-Section is also an option. In the mother, forceps can cause long-term urinary or fecal incontinence; genital tears; and damage to the uterus or bladder. For babies, forceps can cause fractures, bleeding within the skull and facial injuries. That's . when he attempted to position the baby for delivery with . forceps. 'He was pulling and twisting,' Ms Coats said. 'We kept telling him the baby isn't going to . come out - itâ€™s too big. She wasn't turned the right way. He was trying to pull her out and turn her. 'And you can't stop him in the middle because you think the doctor knows what he's doing.' But as he continued to pull, the family heard the pop, she said. 'When . he touched the top and side of the skull, we heard a pop, like clay . cracking in pottery and I heard her skull crush,' she said. 'It was awful - I was holding her leg and I was crying.' At . that moment, Dr Backardjiev turned to Ms Coats and said: 'It's the same . situation as your daughter, just her pelvis was bigger', she said. When he led the delivery on Ms Coats' daughter a month before, Dr Backardjiev . used forceps as well but the baby came out. This time though, the baby . wasn't going to fit. Ms Melancon was taken into the operating . room for a c-section and as soon as her baby was born, she was taken to . another hospital for special treatment for the fractured skull and . severed spinal cord she sustained in birth. Tribute: At the funeral held on Saturday, mourners celebrated baby Olivia's short life by releasing hundreds of balloons into the overcast sky . Hope: Rachel had experienced a healthy pregnancy and the couple were looking forward to their baby's arrival . While Ms Coats and . her son traveled to Houston with the baby, Ms Melancon had to stay . behind and rest. Dr Backardjiev came into her room after the procedure . and was told by a family friend there that they wanted a new doctor. According . to Ms Coats, Dr Backardjiev has not issued an apology to the family . though a member of his staff told 12 News that he is 'distraught' over . Olivia's death. Dr Backardjiev did not return MailOnline's call for comment. What's most upsetting for the family is that the situation was out of their hands. Hard Day: Rachel Melancon and Allen Coats buried their five-day-old daughter today, who died after suffering injuries during birth caused by forceps . Letting go: Olivia's parents, who kept a vigil at her bedside, donated her heart valve to save another baby . 'We . didn't have a choice of forceps or a c-section,' Ms Coats said. 'We never had an option . to say no or even explain, ""Hey this is what can happen when you use . forceps"". We never got that option.' While . the parents are . planning on suing the obstetrician, they're more interested in raising . awareness of the dangers of forceps so that other healthy babies don't . suffer the same fate as Olivia. They have set up a Facebook group to spread the word. While this has been a . heartbreaking period in their lives, the two still plan to get married . and buy a home together. They're going to wait a year for Ms Melancon to . heal and then try for more children. Olivia Marie was both . of the parents first child.","Dr George Backardjiev used forceps to try to deliver baby Olivia Maria Coats, but the baby would not fit down the birth canal .

As the nation struggles to function in spite of the plunging temperatures caused by a 'polar vortex' that has led to the coldest morning in decades, heavy ships that can break chunks of ice are working around the clock to clear major shipping routes and ensure freighters don't get stuck in the thick ice. The ice cutters make clear paths through St. Mary’s River and the Soo Locks as blocks of ice forms in the Great Lakes, where ice can form up to a foot thick in the waterways.

Huge chunks of ice have formed between the U.S. and Canada because of the polar vortex . Four of the gigantic vessels have been working around the clock to keep the shipping lanes open for freighters that connect the river paths to deliver goods between the Midwest and the East Coast, ABC reported. The turbulent weather conditions have been caused by a 'polar vortex' of frigid arctic air, which is predicted to bring record-breaking cold temperatures to the East and Northeast today. Forecasters predict that some 187 million people have now felt the effects of the ‘vortex’, with much of the country suffering a historic freeze that closed schools and businesses on Monday. But more than 70 daily record lows are predicted to fall by the wayside today from the Deep South to the Northeast and Midwest, reports Weather.com. Big chill: The polar vortex has wreaked havoc across the nation and grounded flights, blocked roads and even frozen up the shipping channels . Today's morning lows will  plummet into the 20s below zero over much of the Upper Mississippi Valley, teens below zero in much of the western Great Lakes and Ohio Valley, and below zero as far south as the southern Appalachians. Particularly notable will be the cold in the Ohio Valley on Tuesday morning. For example, Toledo, Ohio may have its coldest morning in almost 20 years (Jan. 18-19, 1994), and may be within five degrees of its all-time record of -20 set on Jan. 21, 1984.

Chicago has suffered plunging temperatures and seen much of its infrastructure suspended because of the freezing conditions . 'The cold is the real killer here,'Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard says in asking schools and businesses to close for a second straight day. The shipping lanes weren't the only form of transportation disrupted by the historic freeze. There also were widespread delays and cancellations in ground transportation - including Amtrak, buses and commuter trains. Officials with Chicago's commuter rail, Metra, said there were multiple accidents, including one in which 14 passengers reported injuries - and six were taken to the hospital with minor injuries - after a train hit a 'bumping post' at a downtown station.

Keith Vidal had a screwdriver and was threatening to fight his mother, police had already subdued when the killing occurred, the parents said during a Monday afternoon press conference. Mentally ill: Keith Vidal suffered from schizophrenia and was having an episode when his family called 911 . Devastated: Keith Vidal's grieving family gathered Monday for a press conference outside the office of the District Attorney . ‘See this kid? This is my son,’ said mother Mary Vidal . while struggling to hold up a picture of the boy hugging a GUMBY mascot, according to WWAY. ‘This . is my flesh and blood that they murdered.’ Officials said during the press conference that . officers from three separate agencies responded following the lunchtime 911 . call. ‘We called 911 and asked for assistance to help us . get him to the emergency room so that he could get proper treatment without . hurting himself,’ Mary Vidal added, according to Port City Daily.

It's a symbol of one of history's greatest explorations - when humans first traveled to another world and, when looking back, saw their home planet. Now the iconic photo of the 1968 Apollo 8 mission, the first manned spacecraft to leave Earth orbit and reach the moon, has been transformed into a video recreating the monumental event now known as 'Earthrise'. The visualization was made using NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft, which has been circling the moon since 2009, coupled with audio records from the mission itself and the dialogue between astronauts Frank Borman, James Lovell and William Anders and is a celebration of the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 8 flight. The image was captured on Christmas Eve 1968. Scroll down for video . NASA has recreated the iconic Apollo 8 'Earthrise' mission as a video simulation 45 years after the journey took place . The moment: Apollo 8 spacecraft is seen hovering over the moon just as Earth begins to rise up, much to the delight of astronauts Frank Borman, James Lovell and William Anders . We're back: Astronauts Frank Borman, James Lovell and William Anders, the first men to leave Earth orbit, returned to a heroic reception . 'This new simulation allows anyone to virtually ride with the astronauts and experience the awe they felt at the vista in front of them,' NASA said, according to NBC. The visualization draws on numerous historical sources, including the actual cloud pattern on Earth from the ESSA-7 satellite and dozens of photographs taken by Apollo 8, and it reveals new, historically significant information about the Earthrise photographs. It has not been widely known that the spacecraft was rolling when the photos were taken, and that it was this roll that brought the Earth into view. The visualization establishes the precise timing of the roll and, for the first time ever, identifies which window each photograph was taken from. It was December 24 1968 and the first lunar voyagers in all of history were emerging from behind the moon for the fourth time. The video was created using NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft, which has been circling the moon since 2009 and has been map the surface of the moon in stunning detail . The first Earthrise shot was taken in black and white as the astronauts scrambled to find color film. It was 1968 after all . It was then that Anders first spotted it, the Earth, peeking over the horizon. 'Oh my God! Look at that picture over there!' exclaimed Anders. 'There's the Earth comin' up. Wow, is that pretty!' What followed was an impromptu photo opportunity, first in black and white and then after quickly locating the proper film cartridge, in stunning full color. 'In lunar orbit, it occurred to me that, here we are, all the way up there at the moon, and we're studying this thing, and it's really the Earth as seen from the moon that's the most interesting aspect of this flight,' Anders told author Andrew Chaikin for the 2009 book Voices from the Moon. Apollo 8 in 1968 was the year before Apollo 13, when man walked on the moon . Anders' color photo of the gibbous Earth hanging over the lunar surface was declared one of the 'great images of the 20th century' and among '100 photographs that changed the world' as selected by the editors of TIME and LIFE magazines. Five months after the Apollo 8 crew returned to Earth, the U.S. Postal Service issued a postage stamp depicting Anders' Earthrise. But as well known as the photograph became, the details regarding its creation were limited for four decades to the astronauts' anecdotes. Then Ernie Wright, the project lead with the Scientific Visualization Studio at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, began reassembling the Apollo 8 crew's experience using data returned by LRO. Friday's video release addressed those issues. 'It just proves what I have long realized - there's always more to discover about Apollo!' Chaikin said.","The Apollo 8 mission took place on December 24, 1968 and was the first time humans left Earth orbit and reached the moon .

This scene outside the Old Bailey yesterday could be the most elite picket line in the history of British industrial relations. The group of lawyers – clearly in a light-hearted mood – walked out in a nationwide barristers’ protest against legal aid cuts. They insist the reductions in fees paid by the taxpayer will stop bright legal brains becoming criminal lawyers. Scroll down for video . Privileged: Barrister Charlotte Hole (front row, second left) clutches a £1,100 Mulberry bag during yesterday's action. She was among thousands of barristers across the UK to stage a protest against legal aid cuts . Some junior barristers earn as little as £13,000 a year, their leaders said. But perhaps it was a mistake for one protester to have her exclusive Mulberry Bayswater handbag on show. The accessory – list price £1,100 – belongs to Charlotte Hole, 31, who would have struggled to buy it on such a salary. However, Oxford-educated Miss Hole later claimed the handbag was a gift from her mother and says on her Twitter account that defence barristers usually earn £50 a day before deductions. She was among thousands of lawyers to protest against Justice Secretary Chris Grayling's plans to slash a further . £200million from the annual £2.1billion legal aid bill by 2018/19. Having fun: Females barristers (left to right) Rebecca Saillet, Charlotte Hole and Aska Fujita enjoy a joke outside the Old Bailey yesterday . Action: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling plans to slash £200million from the annual £2.1billion legal aid bill by 2018/19. But barristers insist the reductions in fees will stop bright legal brains becoming criminal lawyers . The cuts target the fees paid to barristers defending criminals. Yesterday . Nigel Lithman QC, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA), warned of . the effects. ‘You are going to see cases collapsing, as has already . started,’ he said. ‘Without people coming into the system, there will . be nobody of ability to prosecute serious cases.’ He also accused Mr Grayling of 'manipulating' official figures to falsely portray lawyers doing criminal aid work as high-earning 'fat cats'. He added that the average barrister involved in the work earned around £36,000. The Ministry of Justice has said it was . vital to scale back the most expensive legal aid scheme in the world and . insisted it will remain 'very generous' even after the changes. Walk out: Barristers outside Birmingham Crown Court join in with the protest against cuts to legal aid budget . Placards: Lawyers walked out of Southwark Crown Court in London yesterday in protest against the cuts . In arms: Barristers and solicitors not in their wigs outside Westminster Magistrates Court yesterday morning . The . department-highlighted figures showing that 1,200 barristers judged to . be working full-time on taxpayer-funded criminal work received £100,000 . each in fee income last year. Six barristers picked up more than . £500,000 each, it said. The . Bar Standards Board has warned that any barristers who stay away from . court will almost certainly be in breach of their professional code of . conduct with 'very serious consequences'. It . urged the CBA to call off the action which it said could harm the . interests of clients, others involved in a case and public confidence in . the administration of justice. The reforms also include limits on . prisoners' access to legal aid, a household disposable income threshold . for criminal legal aid and reductions in the cost of fees for . representation. Lawyers have not called action today a 'strike' over their obligations to the Legal Aid Agency. Cuts: The government say they must 'scale back' the legal aid system - which is the most expensive in the world. Lawyers at Sheffield Crown Court (pictured) were among those to walk out in protest . Yesterday at the Old Bailey, two brothers who allegedly plotted to . travel abroad for terrorist training appeared without . the assistance of their solicitors. Jurors . in the case of Muhammed Saeed Ahmed and Muhammed Naeem Ahmed were . reminded by Old Bailey judge Gerald Gordon that the 'lonely' courtroom . was a result of the strikes taking place. It was one of a number of cases to suffer setbacks as a result of the action. Around . 70 barristers gathered outside Birmingham Crown Court to back the . walk-out and hear Mark Wall QC read out a statement condemning the . Government's proposals. And . around 150 protesters gathered outside the entrance to London's . Southwark Crown Court where some pre-trial hearings were being held . without all barristers present. Demonstration: Lawyers demonstrate at the Old Bailey. Many cases were heard without legal representation . Warning: The Bar Standards agency warned those who walked out - like these lawyers in Sheffield - could face serious consequences . Many . outside were dressed in their wigs and robes with some holding placards . with the words 'Save British Justice' and 'No legal aid cuts'. Bristol Crown Court dealt only with cases involving vulnerable children and adults this morning because of the walk-out. Earlier, Mr Lithman told the BBC: 'You are going to see cases collapsing, as they have already started. There are cases of murders, murder trials, that have collapsed because of them being inadequately prosecuted - that leads to enormous concerns for the victim's family. 'Secondly, the barristers will not work, they have made that quite clear, at rates that take them, as one person was telling me of his earnings today, to around £13,000 as a taxable income. 'That is a somebody with a law degree and a masters in public international law - why would they work at those rates? The MOJ stood by its proposals today - saying lawyers, pictured at Southwark Crown Court, would still be well paid under the proposals . 'This is how the public will see it as . far as prosecution is concerned - without people coming into the system . there will simply be nobody of ability to prosecute serious cases. 'Where will paedophiles and rapists be living? Not doing the 100-year terms of which the Government speaks but, I am afraid, next door to the public.' But Mr Lithman, whose own case was moved to the afternoon, said the same official statistics showed that - after allowing for VAT and other expenses - the average barrister involved in the work earned around £36,000. The Bar Council calculated that it was lower still - around the £27,000 national average, he said, meaning the cuts would push people away from the vital work. 'There are simply going to be no people of any ability prepared to do criminal legal aid work,' Mr Lithman said. Accusation: The Chair of the Criminal Bar Association accused Justice Secretary Chris Grayling of 'manipulating' official figures. Above, barristers protest outside Birmingham Crown Court . In a dig at the release of the . earnings figures, he said he had been contacted by one barrister who was . earning £13,680 in her second year of practice. 'You . can put out the earnings of five to 10 people, but you can't run the . justice system on the efforts of five to 10 people,' he said. Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, said: 'No-one wants to see disruption in our courts but this unprecedented action shows how relations between the legal profession and David Cameron's Government have collapsed as a result of policies which could restrict access to our courts to only those who can afford it. 'The Lord Chancellor swears an oath to uphold the law of the land, so for Chris Grayling to have lost the confidence of the legal community he relies on to deliver on this oath is extremely worrying.' Frances Cook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, addressed a protest outside Westminster Magistrates' Court. After speaking, she said: 'Abolition of legal aid for prisoners, including teenagers and mothers separated from their babies, is politically motivated and not based on hard financial sense. 'It will mean people spend months, or even years, longer in jail unnecessarily because will no longer get legal support to get the courses they need in prison and to move through the prison maze.' An Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'We entirely agree lawyers should be paid fairly for their work, and believe our proposals do just that. 'We also agree legal aid is a vital part of our justice system - that's why we have to find efficiencies to ensure it remains sustainable and available to those most in need of a lawyer. 'Agencies involved in the criminal justice system will take steps to minimise any upset court disruption could cause for victims and witnesses involved in trials.'","Thousands of barristers walked out today in first ever criminal bar protest .

Attack: The mocked up newspaper which opened Sunday's episode of Sherlock featured a story, headlined 'Thames to become watery motorway' which took a swipe at the London Mayor . The BBC’s raison d’etre to spend the licence fee attacking Conservative politicians, Boris Johnson claimed today after a newspaper in hit show Sherlock branded him ‘dithering, incoherent and self-interested’. The mocked up page did not name Mr Johnson directly, but referred to the ‘current mayor’ and a ‘hair-brained’ (sic) plan to turn the River Thames into a motorway. It said it came after ‘recently-mocked concept of putting an airport in the middle of the estuary’ which Mr Johnson has championed as an alternative to expanding Heathrow. The BBC tried to claim that that the newspaper and mayor featured in Sunday night’s episode were ‘entirely fictional’. But the reference to the Boris Island airport plan and a quote from the ‘mayor’ saying ‘huzzah’ left little doubt who it referred to. Mr Johnson accused the BBC of political bias, but suggested it was in the Corporation’s nature to criticse the Tories. ‘Whatever the BBC may say, they are entitled to spend taxpayers money attacking Conservative politicians, that’s what they do, that’s their raison d’etre,’ he told LBC 97.3. ‘If people can’t make fun of politicians what has gone wrong with the BBC. ‘It is unbelievable, unbelievable… I think it’s perfectly legitimate for people to satirise politicians and there you go.’ His criticism of the BBC comes after he told The Times: ‘It is elementary my dear Watson, I deduce a simple case of BBC bias.’ Sunday’s episode of Sherlock, entitled The Sign of Three, opened with a series of robberies by a gang which police repeatedly failed to catch. Scroll down for video . Bias: Boris Johnson hit back at the political criticism in the newspaper seen in BBC show Sherlock starring Benedict Cumberbatch (right) Bizarre: The newspaper had nothing to do with the main storyline of the episode, which saw Dr John Watson marry his partner Mary Morstan, with Sherlock as best man . Boris Johnson appeared to compare Nick Clegg to a condom this morning in his latest attack on the Deputy Prime Minister. The Mayor of London said the Liberal Democrat leader was 'there to fulfil a very important . ceremonial function as David Cameron's lapdog come prophylactic . protection device for all the difficult things that David Cameron has to . do that cheese off' the public. The two men, who both take part in regular phone-in shows on LBC 97.3 have repeatedly taken potshots at one another in the past, with Mr Clegg branding the mayor a ""slacker"" for only hosting a monthly call-in on the station while Mr Johnson claimed the DPM was an 'idle bum'. In the opening seconds of the programme a newspaper page spun into view, with the headline ‘Bank gang leave cops clueless’. But underneath it had a story headlined: Thames to become watery motorway. The story, which could only be read by pausing the programme, said: ‘A new plan by the current Mayor of London to turn the Thames into a bustling water-bound version of the M25 has hit rush-hour traffic as reaction has been damper than a dip in the rat-infested drink.’ It went on to detail the ‘hair-brained scheme’ to create boats out of the iconic Routemaster bus, which Mr Johnson pledged to bring back to London’s streets. When asked to explain the plan at an event, the ‘mayor’ in the story ‘was found to be dithering, incoherent, and self-interested’. The story added that the plan comes . after ‘the recently-mocked concept of putting an airport in the middle . of the estuary’ which Mr Johnson has championed. The . newspaper had nothing to do with the main storyline of the episode, . which saw Dr John Watson marry his partner Mary Morstan, with Sherlock . as best man. But the . real-life London mayor joked that the real target of the story might . have been his predecessor, Labour’s Ken Livingstone. He . told LBC: ‘I don’t rule out the possibility by the way that this is an . attack on the previous Mayor who after all  himself spent large sums of . public  money on investigating whether there should be a Thames estuary . airport and used to drivel on about putting people on the river. ‘But unlike the previous mayor I actually expanded river transport. Mr Johnson added: ‘We doubled the number of passengers on the river and we are actually getting somewhere at last in sorting our aviation capacity problems. ‘So whatever the BBC may say, they are entitled to spend taxpayers money attacking Conservative politicians, that’s what they do, that’s their raison d’etre. I don’t in any way want to discourage them.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘Sherlock is a fictional drama series, both the newspaper and mayor featured in the episode were entirely fictional and were not named or politically affiliated.’ A new plan by the current Mayor of London to turn the Thames into a bustling water-bound version of the M25 has hit rush-hour traffic as reaction has been damper than a dip in the rat-infested drink. The hair-brained (sic) scheme involved chartering disused boats, paying for their conversion into a version of London's famous bus, the Routemaster, but this plan has already foundered after pilot schemes revealed that customers were walking straight off the boat and into the icy currents of the Thames. When asked to explain how the system might move forward, or even be profitable, or perhaps even to explain the point, the Mayor, who was at a self-promotion event, was found to be dithering, incoherent, and self-interested. He said, ""Well the fact of the matter is that Londoners need to recognise our great naval history, rather than naval gazing, and this will get the traffic moving while invoking memories of Nelson and the like. Huzzar! The plan joins a long list of bizarre concepts including the recently-mocked concept of putting an airport in the middle of the estuary.","London Mayor hits back at the thinly-veiled attack in hit BBC show .

Former Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe accused Priefer of repeatedly making homophobic comments including telling him he would 'burn in hell with the gays', in an article published last Thursday. Priefer has refuted the allegations, but on Monday Kluwe told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that he stood by his original comments and denied that his actions were caused by bitterness that his playing career has ended.

Hillary Clinton has said that she will make a decision about her presidential run next year, explaining that she hadn’t made up her mind yet. ‘It's such a difficult decision and it's one that I am not going to rush into,’ she said during an interview with ABC's Barbara Walters, who selected the former Secretary of State as her most fascinating person of the year. ‘I haven't made up my mind- really have not. I'll look carefully at what I think I can do and make that decision sometime next year.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The smirk that hides it all: Hillary Clinton said that she needs to seriously think about running because it is a big decision, but one that she will not make until next year . Clinton is roundly considered the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in 2016 and while she has repeatedly tried to temper expectations and dodge the question at every speaking engagement she has hosted since leaving public office in January, that has done little to quiet her supporters. One such supporter is her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who she said may have to have a new title if she ever does end up in the White House again. ‘I have no idea- First Mate? I don't know,’ she said of what her husband would be called if she becomes President. ‘He is very respectful... He wants me to do what I think is right.’ Rounding back: This was not the first year that Barbara Walters picked Mrs Clinton as her 'most fascinating' person of the year as she was also selected back in 1993 when she was the First Lady . While she clearly tried to avoid . making any commitments, the one thing she seemed certain of was the fact . that there should be a female president, even though she doesn’t ‘know . the exact timing of it or who that might be’. ‘It . matters because we have half the population that has given so much to . building this country, to making it work and, of course, I want to see . women in the White House,’ she said. ‘If I look at my friends and former colleagues, who are now in the Senate, it was the women senators, on both sides of the aisle, who finally broke the fever over the government shutdown and the debt limit debate. They have been working across party lines, and we need more of that.’ Clinton may be clearly avoiding and commitment to the 2016 race, but the voters aren’t as a Quinnipaic poll that came out on Tuesday revealed that the majority of voters in the pivotal primary state of Iowa think she would make a good chief executive. Remaining positive: Clinton said that she doesn't know who it should be or when it should happen but a woman should become president of the United States . Walters asked what time over the past few decades when she has interviewed Clinton did she think was the roughest period for her- with a not-so subtle allusion to her husband’s affair and ensuing impeachment- but Clinton avoided any mention of those scandalous months. ‘The worst times really for me are the personal times- you know, losing my father, losing my mother. Those are the hard times for me,’ she said. ‘When you're in the political public arena, you know you're going to get credit you probably don't deserve and blame you probably don't deserve and you have to chart your own course.

NHS hospitals are recruiting Spanish and Portuguese nurses in record numbers while British applicants are being refused because places on training courses have been slashed  to cut costs. Managers are spending tens of thousands of pounds employing foreign recruitment agencies to find the nurses – who do not have to be checked to ensure they can speak English. Bosses say there are not enough British-trained nurses  to meet demand, even though nursing has never been a more popular career choice. Replaced: A record number of Spanish and Portuguese nurses now work for the NHS - while British trainee nursing places are axed (file photo) More than 5,000 student nurse places – which cost the NHS £70,000 each – have been axed since the General Election. In 2007, just 75 nurses from Spain and Portugal registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council to work here. In 2012, that had risen 14-fold to 1,060. Last night the Royal College of Nursing said hospital managers had cut student nurse places too hard and too fast. Chief executive Peter Carter said: ‘To save money, they’ve shut off the supply of nurses. It’s so short-sighted.’ Since 2009, one in four nursing training places in England has vanished. They have dropped by 5,325, from 23,121 to 17,796 in 2013. Yet 200,000 people apply to study nursing annually. Rise: In five years the number of nurses from Spain and Portugal registered to work here rose from 75 to 1,060 . The NHS’s ‘yo-yo recruitment’ was ‘stacking up problems for the future’, Dr Carter said. ‘Unless we get a grip on this now, the problem with lack of nurses is going to get worse and we are going to have to go to all points of the compass to fill places.’ And while nurses from  non-EU countries have to undergo strict language tests,  an EU directive means the  NHS cannot insist on English checks for those from Europe. Health Minister Anna Soubry said there was ‘no shortage of nurse training places’. She added: ‘Nurses from abroad make a very valuable contribution. But their clinical skills are no help to patients unless their language skills are up to scratch. ‘Employers must make sure that their staff have the right language skills to do the job.’","Nurses from Spain and Portugal rose from 75 to 1,060 in five years .

Immigrants from Romania and Bulgaria could contribute more to Britain than ‘natives’, a Home Office minister has suggested. Tory Earl Attlee backed claims in the House of Lords that ‘hard-working Romanians and Bulgarians’ would pay more in tax than they claim in benefits and public services, as earlier EU migrants had done. And he added that the government is ‘very happy’ about the free movement of people across the EU after work restrictions were lifted on January 1. Tory Home Office minister Earl Attlee (left) backed claims from Labour's Lord Davies that Romanians and Bulgarians would bring net benefits to Britain . Amid rising public anxiety before Christmas, Mr Cameron announced EU migrants will have to wait for at least three months before they can claim any out-of-work benefits under emergency regulations which took effect from January 1. EU migrants had been able to start claiming jobseeker’s allowance and other benefits within weeks of arriving – prompting concern that some people are arriving, signing on and only then looking for work. But Labour peer Lord Davies, who was a . defence minister in Gordon Brown’s government, pointed to a study which . suggested immigrants brought a net benefit to the UK. In the Lords yesterday, he asked Earl . Attlee: ‘Amid all the unpleasantness in parts of the media over the past . few weeks about Romanians and Bulgarians, has the noble Earl had the . time to see the study recently published by a team from University . College London, which shows that immigrants from the EU over the past 10 . years have contributed far more in taxes and national insurance . contributions than they have consumed in public services and in . benefits, unlike the position of the native population? ‘In . other words, they have supplied us with a substantial financial and . fiscal surplus, to the benefit of every taxpayer in this country. ‘Is there not every probability that hard-working Romanians and Bulgarians will follow in the same footsteps?’ People prepare to board a bus to London via Germany and Franceat the central bus station in Sofia .

'In terms of immigration, in terms of people coming to settle, I would . suggest that for up to a five-year period we don’t have people coming to . settle until we sort out the mess.' Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable 'Setting an arbitrary cap is not helpful, it almost certainly won’t . achieve the below 100,000 level the Conservatives have set, so let’s be . practical about it.’ Tory Prime Minister David Cameron ‘There are other European countries who . like me think it’s wrong that someone from Poland who comes here, who . works hard - and I am absolutely all in favour of that - but I don’t . think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in . Poland.' Poland's foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski ‘If Britain gets our taxpayers, shouldn’t . it also pay their benefits? Why should Polish taxpayers subsidise . British taxpayers’ children?’ According to the UCL study, those from the European Economic Area . (EEA) – the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein – made 'a particularly positive contribution in the decade up to . 2011, contributing 34 per cent more in taxes than they received in . benefits'. Immigrants from outside the area, meanwhile, were reported as . having contributed 2 per cent more in taxes than they received in the . same period. However Mervyn Stone, Emeritus Professor of Statistics . at UCL, and statistician Nigel Williams of the Right-leaning think-tank . Civitas have suggested it was a 'fatally flawed' piece of work. They criticism relate to the methodology used to work out the impact migrants are having on housing and the transport network. Earl Attlee said he agreed with the idea that Romanians and Bulgarians would bring net economic benefits to Britain. He later added that all three main political parties including the Tories had agreed to the work restrictions being lifted after a seven-year transition period. ‘That is why we are very happy with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU, and with the free movement of those peoples, from  January 1.’ However, Ukip leader Nigel Farage sparked controversy when he suggested no new immigrants should be allowed into Britain for five years. He said: 'In terms of immigration, in terms of people coming to settle, I would suggest that for up to a five-year period we don’t have people coming to settle until we sort out the mess.' London Mayor Boris Johnson also increased pressure on Mr Cameron when he called for immigrants to be banned from claiming benefits in Britain for two years, in a direct challenge to government policy. Weeks after minsters rushed through new laws to extend the ban to three months, Mr Johnson said a much longer limit was needed to stop Britain being seen as a 'magnet' for people from poor parts of Europe. He said: ‘If you want to come and work here, you can do that, but there should be a period before which you can claim all benefits and it seems entirely reasonable to me, that they should extend that to two years.'","Earl Attlee backed claims migrants pay more tax and use fewer services .

Abuse: Children's Commissioner Maggie Atkinson says under current smacking laws, adults and pets have better protection than children . Parents should be banned from smacking their children, according to the Children’s Commissioner for England. Unless it is outlawed, pets and adults continue to receive better protection from the law, said Maggie Atkinson. Parents are currently allowed to hit their child if it does not leave a serious mark and is seen as ‘reasonable chastisement’. But Dr Atkinson claims physical chastisement is ‘abuse’ and wants parents to face criminal action for dishing it out. The former teacher said: ‘Personally, having been a teacher, and never having had an issue where I’d need to use physical punishment, I believe we should move to ban it. ‘In law you are forbidden from striking another adult, and from physically chastising your pets, but somehow there is a loophole around the fact that you can physically chastise your child. It’s counter-evidential.’ Dr Atkinson, who has two adult step-children, said she hopes to be a ‘measured’ voice on the emotive issue. She told the Independent: ‘It’s a moral issue. The morals are that, taken to its extreme, physical chastisement is actually physical abuse and I have never understood where you can draw the line between one and the other. ‘Better that it were not permitted. I don’t know if we’d speak out on smacking because there are a lot of other things in the queue,’ she said. London Labour MP David Lammy last year said legislation surrounding smacking needed to be relaxed so working-class parents could instil discipline without fearing prosecution. He also claimed that Labour’s 2004 decision to tighten up the smacking law was partly to blame for last summer’s riots, which erupted in his north London constituency.

More than 1 million Americans faced a post-Christmas jolt this morning as extended federal unemployment benefits came to a halt, with potentially significant implications for the recovering U.S. economy. A tense political battle likely looms when Congress reconvenes in the new, midterm election year. Nudging Congress along, a vacationing President Barack Obama called two senators who are proposing an extension to offer his support. From Hawaii, Obama pledged Friday to push Congress to move quickly next year to address the 'urgent economic priority,' the White House said. For families dependent on cash assistance, the end of the federal government's 'emergency unemployment compensation' will mean some difficult belt-tightening as enrollees lose their average monthly stipend of $1,166. Scroll down for video . Expired: 1.3million Americans lost federal unemployment benefits today. Above, the unemployed attend a job fair in Miami Lakes, Florida last August . Jobless rates could drop, but analysts say the economy may suffer with less money for consumers to spend on everything from clothes to cars. Having let the 'emergency' program expire as part of a budget deal, it's unclear if Congress has the appetite to start it anew. An estimated 1.3million people will be cut off when the federally funded unemployment payments end Saturday. Some 214,000 Californians will lose their payments, a figure expected to rise to more than a half-million by June, the Labor Department said. In the last 12 months, Californians received $4.5billion in federal jobless benefits, much if plowed back into the local economy. Presidential support: While on vacation in Hawaii on Friday, President Obama called up two senators proposing an extension on the benefits to voice his support. Above, Mr Obama and his wife address a group of Marines gathered at a base in Kaneohe Bay on Christmas Day . More than 127,000 New Yorkers also will be cut off this weekend. In New Jersey, 11th among states in population, 90,000 people will immediately lose out. Started under President George W. Bush, the benefits were designed as a cushion for the millions of U.S. citizens who lost their jobs in a recession and failed to find new ones while receiving state jobless benefits, which in most states expire after six months. Another 1.9million people across the country are expected to exhaust their state benefits before the end of June. But Obama has no quick fix. He hailed this month's two-year budget agreement as a breakthrough of bipartisan cooperation while his administration works with Democratic allies in the House and Senate to revive an extension of jobless benefits for those unemployed more than six months. The Obama administration says those payments have kept 11.4 million people out of poverty and benefited almost 17 million children. The cost of them since 2008 has totaled $225billion. At the depth of the recession, laid off workers could qualify for up to 99 weeks of benefits, including the initial 26 weeks provided by states. The most recent extension allowed a total of up to 73 weeks, depending on the state. Restoring up to 47 extra weeks of benefits through 2014 would cost $19billion, according to the Congressional Budget office. House Democrats led by Reps. Sander Levin of Michigan and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland sought to include an extension through March by offsetting the costs with potential farm bill savings. They were rebuffed. Senate Democrats and some Republicans plan another push in 2014. Sens. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, and Dean Heller, R-Nevada, have introduced a bill offering a similar three-month extension, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, has promised to bring it up. But as with much in Congress, an extension is no sure thing. In phone calls on Friday, Obama told Reed and Heller he was glad they were working together to address the problem. 'It defies economic sense, precedent and our values,' Obama economic adviser Gene Sperling said in a statement. A good thing? Some say that the end of federal benefits will cause the long-term unemployed to leave the labor force, resulting in a lower unemployment rate. Above, a job-seeker in Philadelphia fills out an application at a fair last September . House Speaker John Boehner spoke with Obama about an extension earlier this month. Boehner said his caucus would consider the possibility 'as long as it's paid for and as long as there are other efforts that will help get our economy moving once again.' He said the White House has yet to introduce a plan that meets his standards. For other Republicans, the bar is higher. Many of them look at signs of economic growth and an unemployment rate now down to 7 per cent and expected to drop further as evidence the additional weeks of benefits are no longer necessary. The effect of jobless benefits on the unemployment rates has been fiercely debated for decades. To qualify, people have to be seeking work. Tea partiers such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky argue that the payments aggravate rather than relieve unemployment. The benefits allow some jobseekers to hold out for higher wages. Without the benefits, they might accept lower-paying jobs, reducing the unemployment rate. Others may be looking for work only to keep the benefits flowing and will drop out of the job market entirely once the checks stop. In theory, that also would push the unemployment rate lower. The flip side is that the benefits â€” in addition to alleviating suffering â€” get spent on consumer goods, stimulating the economy and creating jobs. No more spending: The end of federal benefits could have a noticeable impact on the economy since the unemployed will not longer have their monthly stipends to spend, which stimulates the economy.

Extended unemployment insurance 'is really a lifeline to help pay the bills, put food on the table, and put gas in the tank so people can look for work,' argued Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director at the left-leaning National Employment Law Project. Michael Feroli, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase, said ending the extended benefits will lower the unemployment rate by half a percentage point as the long-term unemployed leave the labor force. While that statistical change may look good on the surface, Feroli cautioned the drop could be accompanied by a similar decrease in consumer spending. That would also hurt clothing retailers, car dealers and other Main Street businesses. Extending the program, on the other hand, would boost GDP growth by some 0.2 per cent and increase full-time employment by 200,000 next year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated, but at the price of increasing the government's debt. Advocates of extended benefits say communities hardest hit by the recession will feel the sudden loss of cash in circulation the most. They cite a set of their own troublesome figures: three jobseekers still competing for each opening; some 4million people in the ranks of long-term unemployed; unemployment lasting on average 37 weeks, two months longer than most states provide insurance.","Millions of Americans lost their federal unemployment benefits on Saturday following a new budget deal passed by Congress .

Colorado senator Ted Harvey has renewed calls for teachers to be armed in the wake of the shooting at Arapahoe High School where his son was on the debating team with the gunman . A Colorado senator whose son was on the school debating team with the Arapahoe High gunman says the shooting 'validated' the need for teachers to be armed. Karl Pierson, 18, shot Claire Davis at point-blank range with a shotgun on December 13 in a rampage that officials said lasted just 80 seconds. Two members of staff - one of whom was armed - have been hailed as heroes for preventing further fatalities after the shooter took his own life as they closed in on him. But Republican state senator Ted Harvey, whose wife teaches in the Denver suburb of Highlands Ranch, believes weapons-trained staff may have been able to respond even faster. He told FoxNews.com: . 'It (the shooting) validated why I think an armed person in the school . is a good thing. 'I don't want my wife and kids to be sitting ducks.'

He was already in a bit of a hole over fracking but, as he tried to make amends, George Osborne's father-in-law only managed to dig himself in even deeper. Having by his own admission caused a 'great furore' by declaring that shale gas exploration should take place in the 'desolate' North East, Lord Howell corrected himself. He said he meant the North West - sparking a fresh round of derision. Controversy: Lord Howell of Guildford said fracking could go ahead in the North East because it was inhabitable, but now insists he meant the North West . The Tory peer had told the House of Lords that 'beautiful rural areas' of the South should be spared from the controversial drilling. Instead there were 'large, uninhabited and desolate areas' of the North East where there was 'plenty of room for fracking'. His comments in the House of Lords drew gasps of astonishment – and immediate condemnation. Archbishop . of Canterbury Justin Welby tweeted: ‘North east England very beautiful, . rugged, welcoming, inspiring, historic, advancing, not “desolate” as . was said in House of Lords today.’ But the former Energy Secretary now insists that what was on his mind when he made the incendiary remark was 'drilling going on off the Lancashire coast' - in the North West. 'It came out of my mouth as the North East, which you can blame me for rightly,' he told the Daily Telegraph. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg urged Lord Howell to keep quiet. 'I . have a simple bit of advice for Lord Howell, which is when you are in a . hole, stop fracking,' he said on his weekly LBC 97.3 phone-in. Labour's shadow attorney general . Emily Thornberry lambasted the peer for implying it just wanted fracking . to happen 'somewhere a long way from Surrey'. Journalist Mark Ferguson tweeted a picture of Lancashire, adding: 'OI! Lord Howell. This is Lancashire. It’s not #desolate! But it’s all “up there” to some people eh?' Cuadrilla has drilled exploratory wells in Lancashire which is thought to be plentiful in natural gas - but the activity has been blamed for two small earthquakes in the area. Lord Howell, father of the Chancellor's wife Frances, said he had made a 'stupid error' by mentioning any location, because fracking needed to be 'far away from residences in unloved places that are not environmentally sensitive' - unlike wind farms which he blamed for 'terrible desecration' of the landscape. However he added: 'It's odd that they've decided to do this exploring in sensitive places down in Sussex.' Downing Street distanced itself from Lord Howell on Tuesday when the row erupted. Michael Fallon, the Tory energy minister, said there was 'exciting' potential for shale gas in the 'north, south, east and west'. Ministers said that the South could become 'the second biggest area of shale in Britain'. But Mr Clegg suggested that Tories include Mr Osborne and David Cameron were getting 'overexcited' about its potential benefits. He warned it would be 'difficult' to persuade local communities to accept fracking near their homes. Mr Clegg added: 'At the moment we are in a very early stage of all of this. My own hunch is that people are getting a little bit overexcited about how much gas is going to be yielded in a short period of time through fracking.' Yesterday the daughter of singer Chrissie Hynde was arrested at anti-fracking protests. Environmental activist Natalie Hynde, 30, had 'superglued' herself to the entrance of a rural drilling site earmarked for potential fracking in West Sussex. The site in Balcombe has become a focal point for communities concerned about the process. But yesterday Energy Minister Michael Fallon said that 'towns, villages and countryside' could all be targeted for drilling if gas were discovered, no matter their location or beauty. Determined: Natalie Hynde superglued herself to Simon 'Sitting Bull' Medhurst to create a 'human lock' by the gate to the proposed drilling entrance . Removed: Ms Hynde and her partner Mr Medhurst were arrested following the stunt at a protest against fracking planned for a site in Balcombe, West Sussex . So far, 25 protesters have been held by police in Balcombe. Arrested alongside Miss Hynde - the daughter of the Kinks' Ray Davies and the Pretenders star - was her boyfriend, eco-warrior Simon 'Sitting Bull' Medhurst, 55. They had glued their hands together in a 'human lock' by the gate to the proposed drilling entrance at around 8.30am. A row of police officers acted as a human shield to hold back protesters while negotiating with the pair for more than two hours. They were eventually freed using glue thinner and were still in custody last night. They had set up camp opposite the main entrance to the gate. Fracking involves pumping liquid at high pressure deep underground to split shale rock and release gas for use as fuel. Mr Fallon warned the village would not be the only site in the South that could see drilling, if the country is to benefit from a gas bonanza. He added the South could become 'the second biggest area of shale in Britain' and communities could benefit financially. In June, a British Geological Survey claimed there may be more than 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas under the North of England alone. Industry experts claim even if 10 per cent is recovered - more than all of the gas produced from the North Sea - it will be enough to power Britain for 50 years.","Lord Howell branded 'foolish and ill-informed' for attack on the North East .

David Cameron is preparing to defy calls from within the Tory party to cut pensioner benefits. The Prime Minister is understood to be 'minded' to protect the winter fuel allowance, free bus passes and TV licences for the over-75s after the 2015 election. Chancellor George Osborne today signalled that the flagship pledge from 2010 could be repeated, insisting 'pensioner benefits is not the place that I would first turn to' when looking for cuts. Labour and the Lib Dems have already said the perks for over-65s should not be off limits from future welfare savings. Mr Cameron yesterday appeared to leave the door open for cuts to pensioner benefits after the next election, insisting his priority was to guarantee rises in income for people who have retired. However No10 moved to stress that the Prime Minister remained personally committed to the policy despite major opposition within his Cabinet. ‘He is minded to repeat the pledge,’ a Downing Street source said. Mr Osborne went further today, insisting the promise to protect pensioner benefits was based on a 'set of values' to the elderly which had not changed. The Chancellor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'If you were going to be looking for savings in welfare, pensioner benefits is not the place that I would first turn to. 'I would look at housing benefit for the under-25s when there are many people listening to this programme who can’t afford to move out of their home but if you’re on benefits you can get housing benefit under the age of 25; there are people, for example, on incomes of £60,000 or £70,000 living in council homes – I’d look at that. 'I’m not writing the Conservative manifesto today. The commitment we made to pensioners was made on a set of values: a belief in the security, dignity of old age. That’s not going to change.' However he will use a speech today to warn of a ‘year of hard choices’ and of the danger of letting the next generation pay the bill for Britain’s economic problems. The Chancellor and Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, accept Mr Cameron must stick to his pledge not to bring in means-testing this Parliament. Chancellor George Osborne . But they had been thought to want the guarantee dropped for next year’s election, arguing it is unfair to help better-off pensioners when younger people are losing benefits. Mr Cameron now faces a battle to persuade his ministers the pledge should be kept in 2015. Speaking on the BBC yesterday, Mr Cameron had refused three times to say whether he would retain pensioner benefits for the wealthy – a key issue at the last election. Healso refused to say if and when tax cuts could move on to the agenda for the middle class: ‘We will set out our plans for the next election in our manifesto.’ He would insist only that – as with the vow to raise foreign aid – it was important to keep ‘very clear public promises’. The row came as Mr Cameron said the ‘triple lock’, which guarantees the value of the £113-a-week basic state pension, would be kept in place until at least 2020 if he won the 2015 election. The lock, introduced by the Coalition, means the payment automatically rises by the level of inflation, or average wages, or 2.5 per cent – whichever is higher. Mr Cameron now faces a battle to persuade ministers the pledge should be kept in 2015 . Mr Cameron told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show it was right to continue it. ‘It’s a choice based on my values, which is that I want people, when they reach retirement, to know that they can have dignity and security in their old age,’ he said. ‘People who’ve worked hard, who’ve done the right thing, who provided for their families. 'They . should then know they’re going to get a decent state pension and they . don’t have to worry about it lagging behind prices or earnings and I . think it’s the right choice for the country.’ Iain Duncan Smith has argued fiercely for the phasing out of pensioner benefits for the better off . Later on, a Number 10 source said Mr Cameron was still ‘attracted’ to the idea of retaining his pledge to better-off pensioners beyond 2015. The source said he avoided commenting in detail on the issue yesterday because he did not want to deflect attention away from the £12billion promise to maintain the triple lock. Behind the scenes, Mr Duncan Smith has argued fiercely for the phasing out of pensioner benefits for the better off. He argues that the perk is also out of step with the wider policy of reducing benefits to the wealthy, such as the controversial scrapping of all child benefit for higher earners. Last year he said it was an anomaly that all pensioners receive the perks regardless of how wealthy they are. Mr Duncan Smith also appeared to suggest the better off should hand the money back. The Liberal Democrats have refused to countenance any further welfare reform unless Mr Cameron agrees to axe the £2billion in benefits to the better off, including the winter fuel allowance, free bus passes and free TV licences. Even Labour has said it will stop winter fuel payments to 600,000 pensioners on higher and top-rate tax. Private polling for Number 10 has revealed that while there is public support for scrapping the benefits for the better off, a significant majority would view it as a personal betrayal by the Prime Minister. Research shows that older people are much more likely to vote than the young, leading to accusations that pensioners have been spared the worst of the cuts because of fears of a backlash at the polls. Mr Cameron yesterday acknowledged that the Government needed to do more to help younger people. The Prime Minister also hinted the next area of spending to be targeted will be the £20billion housing benefit bill, which he said was now ‘far too high’. The benefit will be included in a new welfare cap to be outlined by Mr Osborne. Retired people will be able to switch annuities under government plans. Steve Webb, the pensions minister, pictured right, said too many were trapped until death in poor-value schemes. ‘When you take out a mortgage, in a few years if rates change you can switch your mortgage. But when you take out an annuity, that’s it – for life,’ he said. ‘This could easily be for a quarter of a century. Why shouldn’t you be able to change your annuity provider so a few years later somebody else could offer you a bigger pension?’ Annuity providers have been attacked for profiting from the confusion their products cause among customers. Outlining a number of reforms, Mr Webb said the ‘murky practices’ included hidden extra charges and more transparency was needed. Annuity rates are at an historic low and can differ by up 20 per cent, depending on the provider.","David Cameron appeared to ditch pledge that winter fuel allowance and free bus passes for the over-75s would continue for the better off .

Pressure: Marc Bolland is expected to reveal general sales fell by 1.5 per cent despite 30 per cent discounts . Marks & Spencer boss Marc Bolland will come under mounting pressure this week following another dismal Christmas for the high street giant. The company is expected to reveal that sales of general merchandise including clothes fell 1.5per cent in the crucial festive period despite discounts of up to 30 per cent. That is far worse than the 0.5 per cent slide analysts had predicted and will trigger renewed speculation over Mr Bolland’s future as chief executive. The results, due to be published on Thursday, will confirm that M&S was one of the big losers on the high street for a third Christmas in a row. Clive Black, a retail analyst at stock broker Shore Capital, said: ‘There was a cautious expectation they were about to turn the corner but it doesn’t look like they have turned much if at all.’ Debenhams issued a severe profits warning on New Year’s Eve as it became the first high profile casualty of the festive season. Tesco and Sainsbury are also expected to release disappointing figures this week. But other retailers have fared far better including John Lewis, Next and House of Fraser. The success of rival stores - and particularly Next where sales jumped 11.9 per cent between November 1 and December 24 - will only serve to highlight just how badly M&S is doing. Annual profits at Next this year are set to beat those at M&S for the first time. The expected 1.5 per cent fall in clothing sales at M&S in the 13 weeks to December 28 is even worse than the 1.3 per cent decline suffered in the previous three months. Food sales are thought to have risen 2 per cent but overall total sales look set to be flat at best. The much-lauded autumn/winter clothing ranges, marketed by a major poster campaign featuring Helen Mirren, have failed to revive the company’s fortunes. Experts thought the high street chain was on the brink of changed fortunes but the new figures disprove that . M&S was forced into heavy discounting in an attempt to win back shoppers including its much-heralded ‘Mega Day’ on the Saturday before Christmas when the price of clothing lines was slashed by up to 30 per cent. Sales of general merchandise have already declined for nine quarters in a row. But Mr Bolland, who has been chief executive since 2010, has denied that the success of the latest autumn/winter ranges, the first from a new clothing team, will make or break his stewardship of the company. He has insisted that the company is on the right track now that decades of under-investment are being addressed and it is thought that investors are willing to give Mr Bolland more time for his turn-around to bear fruit. City commentator David Buik, of stock broker Panmure Gordon, said Mr Bolland’s position as chief executive ‘must be vulnerable’. He said: ‘The problems are with the fashion, which remains dowdy and without flair. The shops are still poorly laid out. Fund managers will run out of patience but will give him another three months.’ He said: ‘The problems are with the fashion, which remains dowdy and without flair.

England's drawn-out humiliation at the hands of a resurgent Australia is finally over, mercifully drawing an end one of England’s worst Test series defeats. Australia obliterated England's batting in a shade over 31 overs to claim a thumping 281-run fifth test victory with more than two days to spare and seal only the third 5-0 sweep in the long history of Ashes series on Sunday. The triumph at a sun-baked Sydney Cricket Ground completed a remarkable turnaround for Australia, who were in disarray after being swept themselves in India and going down 3-0 in England to lose a third successive Ashes series last year. England embarrassed! Australia celebrate winning the Ashes 5-0 in Sydney by raising the urn . Elation: The moment finally comes for Australia as they celebrate their historic victory . Winning feeling: Peter Siddle and Michael Clarke kiss the urn at the awards ceremony . All smiles: Shane Watson high-fives Australian fans as he comes off the pitch . Where did it go wrong? Alastair Cook looks dejected as he tries to contemplate England's dire performance . A big clue to how Australia managed that . turnaround came when paceman Mitchell Johnson was awarded the . Compton-Miller medal as Man of the Series after taking 37 wickets at a . shade under 14 apiece over the five tests. Johnson's ferocious pace again played an integral part in Australia's victory in Sydney but it was no one man show and his fellow quick Ryan Harris won Man of the Match honours after taking five for 25 as England were skittled for 166 on Sunday. 'It's very special after the roller-coaster ride, the ups and downs of 2013,' said Australia captain Michael Clarke, who also played in the 2006-7 sweep but clearly not that of 1920-21. 'It's been a lot of work to get us where we are today. I said to the bowlers at the start of the series that I thought they were the best attack in the world and I think they've shown that in five test matches.' Johnson's revival was even more remarkable than that achieved by Australia, turning him from a figure of ridicule for England's travelling Barmy Army into a bowler who struck fear into the touring batsmen. It was his intervention after tea on Sunday that turned what had been a stately progression to victory into another humiliating rout for the tourists. After finally dismissing Chris Rogers for 119 and bowling Australia out for 276, England stumbled to the break on 87 for three chasing a highly improbable 448 for victory. All changed now: Nathan Lyon replicates England's famous sprinkler celebration . First man down: Mitchell Johnson celebrates taking the wicket of Alastair Cook . Old head frazzled: Ian Bell has to walk off the field after being removed by Ryan Harris for just 16 . Unstoppable: Johnson's ball they kept low and nipped back to dismiss Gary Ballance . One-handed grab: George Bailey takes a stunning catch to dismiss Kevin Pietersen at short leg . Well played: Chris Rogers pulls a ball to the boundary on his way to getting a century . A fifth thumping victory had always looked on the cards after Australia's pace attack tore through England's top order in the first hour of day two. A more spectacular collapse in 11 balls after the second interval on day three made it certain with Johnson dismissing opener Michael Carberry for 43 and Gary Ballance three balls later in the first over. 'Mitchell's bowled a couple of spells in this series that are without doubt as good a spells as I've seen in my career,' said Clarke. 'And I've been lucky enough to play with Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie, Brett Lee and Shane Warne.' Spinner Nathan Lyon took over for the next over and he dismissed Jonny Bairstow for a duck and Scott Borthwick for four to reduce the tourists to 95-7 in a matter of minutes. With England's top order having failed yet again, Ben Stokes (32) and Stuart Broad (42) provided their country's stiffest resistance down the order but they could only delay the inevitable. Agility: Michael Clarke gets down low to take the catch dismissing Scott Borthwick . That's out! Ben Stokes drags Ryan Harris onto his own stumps in the second innings . Spinning master: Nathan Lyon gets several pat on the backs for his efforts . Complete shock: Michael Carberry's bat snaps in half after a ball from Harris . Harris bowled them both before performing the coup de grace on debutant Boyd Rankin and the SCG, bathed in pink in honour of Glenn McGrath's breast cancer charity, rose to hail the Australia team. 'I think today's batting was a culmination of being under the kosh for four and a half games,' said England captain Alastair Cook. 'Credit to Australia, I can't even count on how many sessions we won in the series. That's a pretty daunting stat to take but a very realistic statistic.' Australia had already reclaimed the coveted urn after winning the Brisbane test by 381 runs, the Adelaide match by 218 runs, in Perth by 150 runs and taking an eight-wicket triumph in Melbourne. For a dispirited England, their triumphs in India in 2012 and in Australia in 2010-11 will appear a distant memory and they face an immediate future of recrimination and rebuilding. Raising money: Pink day at the SCG with all supporters showing their support for breast cancer . Problems: Alastair Cook stares into the crowd as he walks off after getting out to Johnson . Bouncers: Boyd Rankin's pitch map shows how short he bowled during Australia's second innings . Aside from criticisms of his . captaincy, Cook's miserable series was a reflection of that of a vaunted . batting line-up which simply failed to fire in the face of sustained . pressure from the Australians. The . England skipper's seven runs on Sunday gave him 246 at an average of . 24.6 for the series, a paltry return compared to the 766 runs at 127 he . accumulated on his last trip to Australia in 2010-11 when he returned . home a 3-1 winner. England's . other top batsmen did not fair much better with Jonathan Trott . returning home after the defeat in the opening test to deal with . stress-related issues and Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen failing to live . up to their billing. The . England bowlers have little more to crow about and one of the many . statistics being bandied about to illustrate Australia's supremacy in . the series will embarrass them. While .

Record breaker: British Adventurer Maria Leijerstam, 35, has become the first in the world to cycle 500 miles across the Antarctic to the South Pole . A British woman today became the first person to ever cycle 500 miles across Antarctica to the South Pole after beating two men to the finish line. Adventurer Maria Leijerstam, 35, pedalled 500 miles across the icy wilderness of Antarctica to win her gruelling record attempt after four years of training. She managed the bike ride to the South Pole in just 10 days - 12 days ahead of schedule despite 'vicious conditions' across the frozen continent. Her three-wheel bicycle and daring route gave her the edge over her two male competitors, American Daniel Burton and Spaniard Juan Menendez Granados. Ms Leijerstam, from the tiny village of Llantrithyd in the the Vale of Glamorgan, set off from the Novo Russian air force base on December 16. It was so cold that at one point even the sweat on the inside of her boots froze. For 10 days she heated her freeze-dried food by melting snow on a small stove inside her wind blasted tent. Her team revealed how snow drifts, complete white outs and crevasses, marred her journey too. But she still incredibly pedalled her way into the record books on a customised recumbent bike PolarCycle. Her mother Adrianne said her daughter's success was due to 'meticulous planning, super fitness and pure determination'. 'From the time she was 12 years old and announced she wanted to be an astronaut, Maria has always been an adventurer,' she said. 'We are thrilled she has made it in such good time.' Norwegian Roald Amundsen was the first person to reach the South Pole in 1911 using two-metre long skis. He was five weeks ahead of the tragic expedition party led by Briton Robert Falcon Scott.

The route: Ms Leijerstam set off from the Amundsen coast across Antarctica to the South Pole. She is now heading back towards the Novo Russian air force base where she can fly back to the UK . Amundsen and his team returned safely to their base, and later learned that Scott and his four companions had died on their return journey. Ms Leijerstam chose a steeper but shorter route than her opponents - and even set off two days later. She also has a vastly different bike from those of Burton and Menendez Granados. While the men chose upright two-wheel machines, she went for a three-wheel recumbent cycle. Her 45kg (100lbs) of food and equipment are stored over the extra wide rear driving wheels to add additional purchase in icy conditions - while the front wheels can be switched for skis to help negotiate snowdrifts. Jumping for joy: Ms Leijerstam beat American Daniel Burton and Spaniard Juan Menendez Granados . No time to rest: Ms Leijerstam spent both Christmas Day and Boxing Day cycling across Antarctica . Ms Leijerstam cycled for up to 18 hours a day - only stopping for three-hour long power naps . Ms Leijerstam rode for up to 18 hours a day, followed by just two-to-three-hour power naps. She was hoping to reach the South Pole by 7 January - but her team say it now may be much sooner and even within a couple of days if all goes well. Before she left Ms Leijerstam said: 'The first five days will be tough but I am well prepared. My sole focus now is to cycle the whole way to the South Pole.' Roald Amundsen's Norwegian expedition first conquered the South Pole in 1911 to beat Captain Scott. Since then the journey has been completed with dog sleds, snowmobiles and four-wheel-drives - but never by bicycle. Wrapped up warm: Ms Leijerstam faced incredibly harsh conditions during snow drifts, white outs and huge crevasses on her trip .

When Paul Lombard quit his job teaching English in South Korea, he could have hopped on a flight and been back home in Cheltenham the next day. Instead the 29-year-old decided to cycle the 6,000 miles back despite never owning a bike before. Mr Lombard set off on March 26 but only arrived home on Sunday after 265 days on the road pedalling across China, the Middle East, and Europe. Paul Lombard, 29, has spent the last 265 days cycling 6,000 miles home from South Korea to Cheltenham . Half way round the world: Mr Lombard cycled from Seoul to Cheltenham via Asia, the Middle East, and Europe . On his trip Mr Lombard tackled temperatures of 50C (122F) in Uzbekistan, dodged bombs in Iraq, and suffered through snow in Germany. He said: 'It was a very exhausting last leg. It was colder and darker and rainier and that pushed me on to get it finished. 'Germany was beautiful, the scenery was nice and there was some snow, but I am glad to be finished. I will probably never experience anything like that again. I've met so many interesting people. Mr Lombard's journey took him 3,000 miles across the width of China. He is pictured here between the central city of Xi'an and the North West province ofLanzhou . For much of the route Mr Lombard followed the G30 Expressway which connects East and West China . 'I wanted to find a more interesting way . of travelling back from South Korea. I wanted a challenge. I just . started looking at different blogs of ways people had got back and saw . that. 'I wasn't much of a . cyclist and didn't know much about bikes, I sort of learned along the . way. I'm really glad I chose to go home that way, it was a great way to . travel.' Paul added that . he had received an early Christmas present on his return, meeting his . seven-month-old nephew Arthur, who was born while he was away. After tackling the sandy deserts of Western China Mr Lombard crossed the border into Kyrgyzstan . The teacher says he often relied on the kindness of locals - including these people from Uzbekistan - who gave him a place to sleep and wash while often struggling to support themselves . Mr Lombard says he had to wait two months before being allowed into Iran and almost cancelled the trip . Once he was allowed in Mr Lombard continued his journey across the country, stopping to visit Tehran . Paul's trip saw him ride 3,000 miles . across China, cross over into Kyrgyzstan, then travel through Tajikistan . and Uzbekistan before heading on to Iran. He . said: 'It was very hot in that region. In Uzbekistan in particular, . where it was 50 degrees, even the local people were saying it was . unnaturally hot. 'It was too hot to cycle in the day, so I would find somewhere cool to rest and continued with my journey at night.' The temperatures in Iran (pictured) were high, but not as high as Uzbekistan where they reached 50C . From Iran Mr Lombard made his way into Iraq where he captured this stunning sunset . While crossing Iraq Mr Lombard had to make a detour after five bombs which off in Iraqi-Kurdistan capital Irbil . Along the way punctured tyres were a constant problem for Mr Lombard, who is an amateur cyclist . Just 192 days into his cycle, in Iraq, Paul was forced to make a last-minute change to his plans when five bombs exploded in the usually safe Iraqi-Kurdistan capital of Irbil.

A 72-year-old amateur gardener has spent three years and £20,000 building Britain's biggest water-powered cuckoo clock - which is the size of a house. Richard Pim designed and built the 25ft tall clock, complete with a 3ft wooden cuckoo which pops out every hour and chimes with a huge pipe organ. It is powered by a complex system of cantilevers, counterweights and pulleys which convert energy from a passing stream. Mr Pim, who is a retired hydrogeologist used his experience to design and . build the wooden structure at his water gardens in Herefordshire. Giant achievement: It took a total of three years and about £20,000 to complete the unique clock . Proud owner: 72-year-old Richard Pim masterminded the project, and built most of the 25-ft tall clock by himself . Wake-up call: This 3ft painted cuckoo is a scaled-up version of the birds that were designed for the original cuckoo clocks made in Germany's Black Forest . He said: 'I think it's quite fun and rather beautiful. I wanted to make something that made people laugh. 'It took a while to build, but I did almost all the work myself. 'I had a local carpenter and local machinists help me with some of the frame and the metalworking though."" Mr Pim's knowledge of complex water-powered structures comes from a long career spent bringing water to arid farmlands in Saudi Arabia and Nepal. He drafted in an organ-maker to help build the complicated mechanism that makes the bird cuckoo. The house uses pipes and bellows to create compressed air to pump through a music box, tuned to mimic the call of the bird. He said: 'It's gaining a few minutes every day at the moment. 'The warmer weather causes the wood to warp slightly and makes the water flow differently through the system of pipes and tanks. Picturesque: At almost 7m tall the cuckoo clock should be an eyesore. But the structure's quaint design and floral surroundings look like a fairytale scene . No need for a watch: Richard Pim and his wife Sally will only have to glance out of the window to see the time in their back garden . Sweet sounds: The organ pipes and music box used to generate the distinctive cuckoo call every hour. Mr Pim had help from a specialist organ-maker to build the clock's mechanism . 'But no-one's setting their watches by it.' The . clock is one of the attractions at . Westonbury Mill Water Gardens, a three-and-a-half acre visitor garden. Mr Pim owns a granite tower with gargoyles modelled after his own head, and an igloo built out of glass bottles. His wife Sally said: 'Three years to build the clock is . astonishing. I think it's amazing what Richard does, astonishing.' Mr Pim . said: 'I'm going to keep on making them until I can't any more, I . think. It's something I enjoy very much and it keeps me very busy, and . happy. 'A garden needs some action. It's a great thing for kids to come and see the mechanism - to see how engineering really works.' Hard graft: Mr Pim had some help from local carpenters to complete his mammoth project, but did most of the work himself .

Biden thanked the group for wanting to visit the United States and added that he hoped their visit would teach them that ‘innovation can only occur where you can breathe free.’ ‘I hope you observe it when you're there,’ The Vice President added. ‘From the beginning of our country, it's a constant stream of new immigrants, new cultures, new ideas, new religions, brand new people continuing to reinvigorate the spirit of America.’ Addressing the future:  Joe Biden and the US Ambassador to China, Gary Locke, meet visa applicants at the U.S. Embassy Consular Section . Learning curve: The Vice President  thanked visa applicants for wanting to visit the United States and added that he hoped their visit would teach them that 'innovation can only occur where you can breathe free' Although he held the American system high, he praised China's education. Yesterday, results from a global exam showed the American students are once again lagging behind many of their Asian and European peers. Students in Shanghai, China's largest city, had the top scores in all subjects on that exam. ‘Even though some countries' educational systems are better than America's - particularly in grade school - there is one thing that's stamped in the DNA of every American, whether they are naturalized citizens or natural-born,’ Mr Biden said. ‘It's an inherent rejection of orthodoxy.’ This is not the first time Mr Biden has made controversial comments on China and its totalitarian rule. Earlier this year he told students at the University of Pennsylvania that you can't think differently in a nation where you can't breathe free. Visiting Chinese students at the university said they were offended and requested an apology. Greetings: The Vice President waves as he walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter Finnegan Biden and son Hunter Biden upon touching ground in Beijing earlier today . Later in the afternoon, the Vice President said that US-China relations depend on trust and a positive notion of each other's motives. Neither leader made public mention of a major clash over disputed airspace that's pitted China against the U.S. and its Asian allies. Mr Biden said the relationship between the two major powers will significantly affect the course of the 21st century. If the US and China can get that relationship right, the possibilities are limitless, he added. 'Complex relationships require sustained, high-level engagement, and that's why I'm here,', Mr Biden said emerging from a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Absent from the Vice President's comments was any discussion of US concerns over China's new air defense zone. In Tokyo a day earlier, Biden pledged to raise those concerns 'with great specificity' with Xi and other Chinese leaders, adding that China's move was deeply concerning. 'This action has raised regional tensions and increased the risk of accidents and miscalculation,' Biden said Tuesday after meeting with Japanese President Shinzo Abe, whose government has been on edge for the past two weeks since China unilaterally asserted its authority over airspace above tiny islands that China and Japan both claim.","Joe Biden told Chinese students to challenge their nation's authority .

Influenza activity has been recorded in all parts of the United States, with half of the country reporting widespread outbreaks attributed to H1N1, the virus that caused a worldwide pandemic in 2009-2010 and resulted in an estimated 284,000 people died. Thousands of people die every year from the flu, which peaks in the United States between October and March, hitting the hardest in January and February. Texas has been the most affected so far, with at least 25 people dying this season from the flu, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, while North Carolina has already reported 13 deaths, according to the state's Department of Health and Human Services, and two people have died in Salt Lake City. Nationally six children have died, the latest report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Widespread: Influenza activity has been recorded across the country, with the south, particularly Texas, the hardest hit so far. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not record adult deaths from the flu, dozens have been reported across different states . According to flu.gov, between 5 percent and 20 percent of people living in the U.S. get the flu each year. Symptoms can be mild or severe and include fever, a cough, sore throat, weakness, headache and aches and pains in the joints and muscles around the eyes. Serious complications include bacterial pneumonia, ear or sinus infections, dehydration or worsening of chronic health conditions. The CDC has documented 1,583 laboratory-confirmed cases of the flu since Oct. 1, 2013. 'The spectrum of illness observed thus far in the 2013-14 season has ranged from mild to severe and is consistent with that of other influenza seasons,' the CDC said. At risk: While children are commonly the most susceptible to influenza and the older population the most likely to die from it, the CDC has this year warned that young people could be among the most infected . Protect yourself: While there is no vaccine for the current outbreak of H1N1, health experts have said getting an annual flu shot is a first line of defense against the virus . 'We are seeing a big uptick in disease in the past couple of weeks,' said Dr. Joe Bresee, chief of Epidemiology and Prevention in the CDC's Influenza Division. - Up to 20 percent of the population contract it each year . - About 23,000 people die during flu season . - In 2012, the flu vaccination reduced 6 million cases . - It also prevented 79,000 hospitalizations . - Flu season runs from October until April . - It peaks in January and February . - Everyone over 6 months should get vaccinated, including pregnant women . 'The virus is all around the United States right now.' In 2009-2010 outbreak, the H1N1 virus - also known as swine flu and commonly associated with hitting children the hardest - spread from Central Mexico to 74 other countries. With H1N1 the main strain again this year, health officials are expecting a different age group to also be widely affected. 'Based on what we're seeing so far, this year will be a very different picture than last year,' said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. 'We fully expect to see many more cases in younger children and middle-aged adults. 'Mark my word, by the end of next week we'll probably see some fear and panic as it starts to hit kids.' This year's flu vaccine contains the H1N1 strain and should offer good protection. A CDC graph, released as part of a new report on Friday, shows the national increase in people who tested positive to influenza . There's still time to get vaccinated and protect yourself and your family, Bresee said. 'It's too early to tell how severe it's going to be but we're still on the up slope of the flu season, so what we can expect is more flu, more intense disease and more deaths over the next few weeks,' Bresee said. 'There is still a lot of season to come,' Bresee said. 'If folks haven't been vaccinated, we recommend they do it now. The Texas Department of State Health Services issued an ""influenza health alert"" on Dec. 20, advising clinicians to consider antiviral treatment, even if an initial rapid-flu test comes back negative. 'The flu is considered widespread in Texas,' Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the state's health department, said.","Influenza cases no recorded in all parts of the U.S. and spreading, with Texas, South Carolina and Utah so far the most affected .

A new mother nearly died after her C-section wound became infected with MRSA - leaving her with a 10-inch hole across her stomach. Gemma Wilby, 30, gave birth to her son Alfie in September 2012 in a south London hospital but soon became aware she had  contracted an infection. Despite undergoing life-saving surgery, . having maggots placed on the wound to eat away the dead flesh and taking a cocktail of daily drugs, the MRSA could . not be brought under control and she was warned she could die. Lucky to be alive: Gemma Wilby, 30, gave birth to her son Alfie in September 2012 but her C-section wound became infected with MRSA. She believes the only reason she is alive today is due to copper-infused pyjamas which fought the bug, developed by family friend Amber McCleary (left) She believes the only reason she is here today is because she wore copper-infused pyjamas which killed the infection. When she arrived at hospital in labour, she was rushed into theatre as she was suffering from compilcations. Ms Wilby said: 'They told me I would need an emergency C-section but I don’t . remember much of it as I was drifting in and out of consciousness.' Several . hours later her son Alfie arrived, weighing 7.6lbs. ‘I . was dizzy and exhausted after giving birth,’ said Ms Wilby. 'My C-section scar spread 10 inches from hip to hip and I was in . excruciating pain. 'It . hurt too much to hold Alfie but nurses gently placed him on me a few . hours later. But I didn’t feel great, and I was kept in because my blood . counts were abnormally high.' But it soon became clear that Ms Wilby, who lives . with her long-term partner Mark Minick, 31, a chef , had also contracted an infection. Despite this, 'the hospital has never . confirmed where the infection came from and has said there isn’t enough . evidence to be sure,' she said. Lifesaver: Despite undergoing life-saving surgery, having maggots placed on the wound to eat away the dead flesh and taking a cocktail of daily drugs, the MRSA could not be brought under control and Ms Wilby was warned she could die. She believes the only reason she is here today is because she wore copper-infused pyjamas (pictured) which killed the infection . 'They told me my scar wasn’t healing properly and I had an open . wound, but they didn’t show me it when they changed dressings. 'I had no . idea quite how bad things had got - although the overpowering stench of . rotting flesh made me realise something was terribly wrong after a few . days. ‘I felt really . embarrassed and didn’t want my partner coming near me. On top of this, . because I was on a cocktail of antibiotics I wasn’t allowed to . breastfeed Alfie and I could barely hold him for longer than a few . seconds because of the pain. It was horrible.’ On . 25 September, 20 days after giving birth, Ms Wilby was discharged . from hospital with Alfie. At this point, she still didn’t know what the . infection was. But a day later, a district nurse visiting her was so . concerned she sent her back to her GP, who told her she needed urgent . treatment. Ms Wilby said: 'By now, none of the antibiotics were working and the wound had doubled in . size. My GP said to go straight back to the hospital as an emergency as . it had all the signs of MRSA. ‘You could smell me from 10 feet away. We knew in our hearts that this wasn’t just an infection, it was more sinister.’ MRSA: At its worst, the infection left Ms Wilby with a 10-inch gaping hole. She was only discharged once it got to this stage . Too . scared to return to the original hospital she’d been a patient at, she underwent life-saving treatment at East Surrey Hospital on October 6, 2012. After the surgery, she was kept in . hospital for five days while doctors monitored her recovery. She was even given maggot therapy - where live maggots were placed . in the open wound to eat away the dead flesh - but the infection was so . severe the maggots died. By this time, a family friend had heard about Ms Wilby's condition and said copper might be able to help. Amber McCleary, 18, had spent 18 months researching . antimicrobial fabric testing and had carried out various lab tests which . proved bacteria couldn’t survive on copper. With this in mind, she . approached UK inventor Paula Ward and the pair produced a pair of copper-infused pyjamas for her friend. Ms Wilby said: ‘Amber brought me copper PJs, . bedding, socks and a hospital gown - and all had been lab . proven to be anti MRSA. 'At first I was sceptical about the copper-infused PJs, but within a  a . couple days I felt much better and noticed the open wound was . decreasing in size. ‘It was incredible. The nurses took swabs from my stomach daily and they always came . back infected with MRSA, but a few days after wearing the . copper-infused clothing, they came back negative. 'They couldn’t believe . it and thought there had been a mistake. They took another one just to . be double check. To our amazement, it was negative! The infection was . gone and the open wound was shrinking. We were lost for words. It was at . that point I knew I wasn’t going to die.’ ‘You . wouldn’t think something so simple could make such a huge difference . but I could feel the difference in my skin almost overnight. Instead of . feeling lethargic I felt brighter, more alert and healthier. More . importantly, I was healing. It was a miracle.’ In . the days and weeks that followed, she ontinued to ‘live in’ her . copper pyjamas and nurses commented on how quickly she was healing and were . positive the nightwear was behind her speedy recovery. Surgery: Ms Wilby underwent life-saving surgery at a different hospital, East Surrey, as doctors battled to fight the superbug ravaging her body . ‘I cherished them after that,’ says Ms Wilby. ‘I wouldn’t take them off. Medics said it would take me a year to . recover but by Christmas, less than two months later, I was back on my . feet and feeling normal again. Copper is known for its healing powers . and it really accelerated the process for me.’ As part of their research, Copper . Clothing (the company formed by Ms Ward and Ms McCleary) collected a 1cm square sample of Ms Wilby's NHS gown and another . from the copper infused material. Both were washed at 65 degrees and . sent away to be tested under stringent 'MRSA protocol' in a laboratory. After . 24 hours, over 400 million superbug bacteria were picked up on the NHS . fabric whereas the copper-infused material had no superbug bacteria. Over the years, copper oxide has become . an increasingly popular component in health products because of its . natural anti-microbial and healing properties. Already, in countries . such as Japan, hospital staff and patients wear copper-infused clothing . as a matter of course. Now, one year on, Croydon University Hospital is clinically . trialling the pioneering clothing after hearing Ms Wilby's success story - . believing it could revolutionise the NHS, who are fighting an ongoing . battle against increasingly antibiotic resistant superbugs such as MRSA. Pioneering: Amber Cleary spent 18 months researching antimicrobial fabric testing and had carried out various lab tests which proved bacteria couldn¿t survive on copper . Mr Abdul Sultan, Consultant Obstetrician . and Gynaecologist at Croydon University Hospital, said: 'This clothing . may have the potential to make a real difference to the way in which we . treat ulcers and infection in patients, based on the research I have . seen which was available on the subject. 'We believe that the . laboratory-based research looked very promising and there is now a need . for controlled clinical trials. We are in the process of setting up a . clinical trial to establish the medical medical benefits of this clothing.' Ms Wilby said: ‘Hospitals up and down the country should make copper-infused clothing and bedding mandatory for all staff and patients. 'I . was so terrified I was going to die I couldn’t bond with my newborn . baby. Every time I looked at him, I wondered if he’d soon be motherless. It was a horrific time and I honestly believe that I owe my life to the . PJs. ‘If it hadn’t . have been for them, I don’t think I’d be here today. I had maggots . placed into my stomach to eat away the rotting flesh and surgery to cut . away at it, but it only really improved when I started wearing the PJS. I . wouldn’t take them off after that.’ Ms Wilby is now back working as a barmaid . and is enjoying motherhood. ‘I don’t take anything for granted now,’ she says, ‘I appreciate every second with my partner and son and don’t . worry about the small things anymore. I don’t want anybody to go through . what I did and that’s why I’ve chosen to speak out.'","Gemma Wilby, 30, gave birth to her son Alfie in September 2012 .

Speaking about her drastic new hair style, Amber said: 'I've just dyed half of my blonde streaks pink and red. 'I did it myself and know it looks shocking but I agree with Mum that a girl shouldn't get stuck in a rut and a time warp with hairstyles - like so many women do. 'Even I was shocked when Mum lopped off so much of her lovely hair, but she told me she really needed a radical change as a sort of mental stimulus!' But, says Amber, 23,: 'Maybe I'm more cautious than Mum because I've only dyed half of my head- and it will wash out after a few months!' Amber Le Bon previously had chocolate brown locks .

It can be much more bold so it's important to communicate with your stylist and colourist to perfect the look. Dark hair needs to be bleached first before applying the colour so this is not a look if you suffer from very dry hair. The look can be maintained as you care for it at home â€“ this is vital step for ensuring longevity of the colour â€“ Iâ€™d personally recommend a Wella colour saver to keep that colour in top condition.",Amber stepped out with bright pink and blue hair on catwalk at Fashion Night Out Westfield .

Overall, humans are becoming increasingly carnivorous, but there are decreases in meat consumption in certain countries, the study said . Across the globe, humans are eating increasing quantities of meat. The change to an increasingly carnivorous diet is driven by the fast-growing economics of China and India, scientists have said. French researchers have discovered ‘significant’ links between the World Bank’s development indicators and the food humans eat in different countries, to draw relationships between socio-economic, environmental and health conditions and changing dietary patterns. Overall, humans might be becoming increasingly carnivorous, but the study also found we cannot be considered apex predators. The research, which was published in PNAS, examines what people eat in different countries and claims to be the first study to calculate the trophic level of humans – a measurement in ecology that reveals our place in the food chain. Plants and algae are at trophic level one, as they create their own food, while herbivores are level two and animals which eat herbivores are at level three. Carnivores that eat smaller carnivores are at trophic level four, while carnivores with few predators, such as polar bears or lions, occupy level five. Sylvain Bonhommeau, a fisheries scientist at the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea in Sète, who led the research, said humanity’s median trophic level was approximately 2.21 in 2009. She told Nature: ‘We are closer to herbivore than carnivore. It changes the perception of being top predator.’ In the study, the scientists used the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation's data on 102 different foods to calculate humans' trophic levels for 176 countries each year from the 1961 to 2009 . One - Plants and algae, which create their own food. Two - Herbivores such as rabbits...and humans, which the study said have an average trophic level of 2.21 in 2009. Three - Animals that eat herbivores, including foxes. Four - Carnivores . that eat smaller carnivores, such as cod that eat fish. Five - Carnivores . with few predators, such as polar bears or lions. As well as determining the trophic level of humanity, the study examines how people’s eating habits have change. To do this, the scientists used the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation’s data on 102 different foods to calculate humans’ trophic levels for 176 countries each year from the 1961 to 2009. They discovered that over the 50 year period, humans increased their consumption of fat and meat to move higher up the food chain, by 3 per cent or 0.06. While this might seem like a small change, an environmental scientist commenting on the study believes it is deceptively large. Thomas Kastner of Alpen-Adria University in Vienna told the publication that because a creature’s trophic level is calculated by the sum of the trophic levels of food it consumes, a change of 0.1 means a predator near the top of the food chain – including humans – are actually consuming considerably more meat. People in China and India, who have traditionally eaten a lot of rice-based dishes, are becoming gradually wealthier as their countries have enjoyed a period of economic growth and have therefore seen 'marked increases' in their trophic levels as they eat more meat. Meat kebabs on sale at a stall in Old Delhi are pictured . However, people in different countries are becoming more or less carnivorous. The scientists said: ‘We show that, although countries have diverse diets, there are just five major groups of countries with similar dietary trends.’ People in China and India, who have traditionally eaten a lot of rice-based dishes, are becoming gradually wealthier as their countries have enjoyed a period of economic growth and have therefore seen ‘marked increases’ in their trophic levels as they eat more meat. However, in places including Iceland and Mongolia, where people have traditionally eaten a diet heavy on meat, fish and dairy, other food groups are now easier to obtain and the people living there are eating slightly less meat than before. The researchers believe their study will help scientists better understand the human impact on resource and energy consumption, which is especially important as the impact of producing meat is much larger than that of growing vegetables. Dr Bonhommeau warned that if humans increase our trophic level, we will ‘start to have a bigger impact on ecosystems'. Sylvain Bonhommeau, a fisheries scientist at the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea in Sète, said humanity's median trophic level was approximately 2.21 in 2009, putting it closer to the trophic level of herbivores like rabbits, than carnivores. 'It changes the perception of being top predator,' she said .","French researchers have discovered .

The winter fuel allowance and free bus passes are only protected until 2015, David Cameron said today as he promised future rises in the state pension. Mr Cameron appeared to leave the door open for cuts to pensioner benefits after the next election, insisting his priority was to guarantee rises in income for people who have retired. The Prime Minister has come under increasing pressure to ditch his promise to protect welfare handouts for wealthy over-65s at a time when the benefits bill is continuing to rise. David Cameron (pictured with Andrew Marr today) has left the door open for cuts to pensioner benefits . Mr Cameron today insisted the pledge . made in the run-up to the 2010 general election not to cut the winter . fuel allowance, free bus passes and free TV licences for the over-75s . would be honoured for this parliament. But pressed on whether he . would protect them after 2015, he told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘We will . set out our plans in our manifesto.’ Labour and the Lib Dems have already said the pensioner benefits should not be off limits from future welfare cuts. Mr . Cameron made clear that he wants to ensure the state pension continues . to rise, pledging that all pensioners will get a bumper £1,000-a-year . rise if the Tories win the election. This photograph shows Mr Cameron leaving the Andrew Marr Show this morning . The Prime Minister said he would . guarantee that Britain’s 12 million elderly get a minimum extra 2.5 per . cent every year on their state pension from 2015 to 2020 – and more if . prices or wages rise faster. The offer, which equates to an increase . of around £20 a week on the basic state pension, will add about . £12  billion a year to the pensions bill. It means that by 2020, the . state pension could rise to £160 a week. The move is an attempt to win . the crucial ‘grey vote’. An estimated one in three people who vote in elections are over the official retirement age, both due to longer life expectancy and a significantly higher turnout rate compared with the under-40s. The new package comes after the Prime Minister vowed to maintain the so-called ‘triple lock’ on pension rises. Introduced in 2010, it ensures that the state pension rises each year in line with whichever is highest among average wages, inflation, or 2.5 per cent. It means that though wages rose by only 0.7 per cent last year, the state pension will go up in April by 2.7 per cent – in line with prices. It will take the basic pension, before contribution-related elements, to £113.10 a week. An estimated one in three people who vote in elections are over the official retirement age . Experts say that keeping the ‘triple . lock’ in place until the end of the next Parliament will be worth a bare . minimum of £900 a year to pensioners compared with their current income . - and potentially much more if wages or inflation race ahead. Mr . Cameron has already vowed to introduce a flat-rate pension of £144 a . week in 2016. If it rises by 2.5 per cent a year from then until 2020, . the weekly pension could be up to £160. Campaigners were quick to point out last night that much of the increase will be swallowed up by rising bills for energy, food and other essential items. Mr Cameron said: ‘I am determined to give people who have worked hard and done the right thing security and peace of mind in retirement. 'We are only able do this because we are taking the difficult decisions to tackle the deficit and put our economy back on the right path.’ The basic state pension now represents a higher share of average earnings than at any time over the past 20 years.","Door left open for winter fuel allowance and free bus passes to be cut .

David Cameron today hit back at critics of government-backed mortgages, insisting he was helping people without wealthy parents to 'realise their dreams' of owning their own home. More than 100 people every working day are buying new homes under the Government's Help to Buy scheme, new figures show. The Prime Minister announced that 6,000 applicants have applied for a mortgage using the scheme at a rate of 500 a week in the three months since Chancellor George Osborne unveiled the plans. Life-changing: David Cameron has a cup of tea with Sharon Ray and her daughter Maisie, 2, during a visit to her home in Southampton, Hampshire which she has bought through the government's Help to Buy scheme . Dream: Mr Cameron said the government wanted to help more people to buy their own homes . Officials say that will mean a total of . £910million in extra lending to those trying to get on the housing . ladder or trade up to a larger property. The Prime Minister hailed the scheme as . evidence that the Government has been able to help those who can afford . a mortgage but did not previously have the money to put down a deposit. And he hit back at critics like Business Secretary Vince Cable who warn that Help to Buy is . contributing to another house price boom. Speaking on a visit to Southampton, Mr Cameron said: 'Where we are today, house prices are still way below the . peak they reached in 2007. 'Forecasters do not think they will get back to the . level before the crash even in 2019. So there is no evidence of a problem. 'This is about helping people to achieve the . security and stability they want of owning a flat or a home of their own. 'We are not helping people to buy flats or homes . they cannot afford. We are helping people who do not have wealthy . parents, who cannot get a big deposit together, and helping them to realise . their dreams.' Bubble: On a visit to a new housing development in Southampton, the Prime Minister brushed aside fears that the Help to Buy Scheme was fuelling a new property price boom . Experts are already predicting . house price rises of between 8 and 10 per cent next year, pushing . property further out of reach for millions. Mr Cable said last month that the Government should ‘look . again’ at the Help to Buy scheme, which he blames for a ‘raging housing . boom’ in London and the South East. He . warned that if the Bank of England does not raise interest rates it . might ‘get out of control’ and mean that ‘the only people who can live . in large parts of London are foreigners and bankers. We don’t want . that’. Under the scheme, . people with a deposit of 5 per cent can get mortgages that are usually . only available to those with a deposit of 20 per cent, because the . Government underwrites the risk to the mortgage lenders. But Downing Street insisted that Help to Buy supports ‘responsible lending’. Three . quarters of Help to Buy mortgage applications came from outside London . and the South East and eight out of ten were from first time buyers. On average households are looking to buy homes worth £160,000, below the UK average house price of £247,000. Split: Chancellor George Osborne unveiled the Help to Buy scheme three months ago but Business Secretary Vince Cable has warned it risks fuelling a new house price bubble . No . 10 said applicants will face average monthly repayments of around £900 . and have an annual household income of around £45,000, making their . mortgage payments 23 per cent of their gross income. Mr . Cameron added: ‘The New Year is often a time when people look to make . those big life-changing decisions like moving home or taking that first . step on the housing ladder. ‘But . too many people have found themselves frozen out of the market in . recent years as a result of the size of the deposit required. ‘That . is why as part of our long-term economic plan we introduced the Help to . Buy scheme, so hardworking people with sufficient earnings can get on, . fulfil their aspirations and enjoy the security of owning their own . home. ‘In less than three . months, the scheme has already helped thousands of people. I want to see . that continue in 2014 and for Help to Buy to help thousands more . realise their dream of home ownership.’ In . just 12 weeks since the scheme launched, nearly 750 homeowners have . completed their purchases and hundreds were able to spend Christmas in . their new homes. Jade Green, . her partner Ian and her six year old son Rhys, declared Help to Buy ‘a . miracle’ after she was able to buy her dream home. ‘After . a hard few years saving, our dream property came onto the market, we . viewed it, fell in love with it, then had to come to terms with the fact . that we couldn’t raise enough money for a deposit on a mortgage,’ she . said. ‘Just when we had . given up hope, Help to Buy became available, which was a miracle for us, . it made it possible for us to afford the mortgage deposit. Only one . week after our first viewing, we put in an offer, which was accepted and . 5 weeks later we moved in.’ Six thousand applicants have applied for a mortgage using the Help to Buy scheme at a rate of 500 a week in the three months since Chancellor George Osborne unveiled the plans . Daniel . Fuller, a father of twins aged one and his partner moved into their new home in Sheffield at the start of December. He . said: ‘The help to buy scheme has given us the opportunity to get onto . the property ladder. Without this we would have still been renting and . buying wouldn’t have been possible, due to the large deposits. It was . great to enjoy Christmas as a family in our own home.’ Barclays . and Santander will introduce their own Help to Buy products onto the . market this month, joining Lloyds, RBS, HSBC, Virgin Money and Aldermore . who have all launched products over the last three months. An . additional 20,000 households have also been supported by separate . equity loan scheme, also called Help to Buy, in which the Government . provides an interest-free loan to support the purchase of a newly built . home. Liberal Democrat sources confirmed that Mr Cable remains ‘sceptical’ about the scheme. Emma Reynolds, Labour's shadow housing ninister, said: 'Any help for first time buyers struggling to get on the property ladder is to be welcomed. 'But rising demand for housing must be matched with rising supply if this scheme is to bring the cost of housing within the reach of low and middle income earners. 'You can't deal with the cost-of-living crisis without building more homes.'","David Cameron reveals 6,000 people have applied in just three months .

Tragic: Chris Ogden, who was found dead at a recycling plant in Leeds after he fell asleep in a skip in Huddersfield and was crushed to death . A father-of-one was crushed to death in a bin lorry after climbing into a skip to keep warm and sleep after getting drunk and high on cannabis on a night out, an inquest heard. Chris Ogden, 23, had got high before going out clubbing and getting drunk in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. Seeking shelter on his way home, he clambered into a large skip. An hour later the bin lorry arrived to collect the skip outside a bus station and Mr Ogden, who had probably fallen asleep, was crushed to death by the vehicle’s mechanical compressor, Bradford Coroner’s Court heard. Coroner Dominic Bell recorded a verdict of accidental death related to alcohol and drug use. But the family of Mr Ogden, who had a son, Alfie, aged two, angrily stormed out of court as the verdict was given. Outside they said the verdict made Mr Ogden look like a 'drug addict' and during the hearing questioned whether the binmen had first checked the skip for rough-sleepers before it was emptied. Earlier the inquest heard Mr Ogden, from Halifax, had smoked four spliffs with his best friend Dean Biddlecombe before they went out for 'Student night' in Huddersfield on January 24 last year. There they downed Jaeger bombs in a pub and went to a club where Mr Ogden proudly showed people photos on his phone of his young son before he fell asleep, rowed with bouncers and was eventually thrown out. He hung around the town’s bus station for an hour but it was closed and he was captured on CCTV staggering around and falling asleep standing up leaning against doors. At 4.47am CCTV captured him climbing on top of the skip, before one hour and one minute later the bin lorry arrived to collect the skip with the contents then compressed by the mechanical crusher on the vehicle. Later that day the the lorry load was emptied at Leeds Paper Recycling, where the waste was dumped onto a conveyor belt and shocked workers spotted Mr Ogden’s body. Pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd, who carried out a post mortem investigation on Mr Ogden, said there were extensive signs typical of asphyxia on his face and body. There were also 29 minor injuries on his upper body, mainly grazes and bruises. He gave the cause of death as traumatic asphyxia due to the lorry’s mechanical waste compression crushing his chest. Toxicology reports showed both alcohol and cannabis in Mr Ogden’s body, which may have had a 'detrimental effect on his motor and cognitive function' - but these were also described as 'minimal' though it may have delayed his response to what was happening when the skip was collected by the bin lorry, Dr Shepherd said. Grim discovery: Later that day the the lorry load was emptied at Leeds Paper Recycling, pictured, where the waste was dumped onto a conveyor belt and horrified workers spotted Mr Ogden's lifeless body . Detective Constable Mark Willetts, from West Yorkshire Police said police had found no evidence of criminal action or neglect by either the bus station, recycling firm or bin lorry drivers. The case of Chris Ogden is a tragic repeat of that of a Canadian student who got drunk on his first night in the UK and was crushed to death in the back of a bin lorry after falling asleep in a giant wheelie bin. Garrett Elsey, 22, drank a dozen drinks with a British medical student friend he met on a rugby tour just hours after enrolling at the University of Bristol, an inquest heard. But the following day bin men discovered the body of the masters student when they emptied their lorry at a plant in the outskirts of the city. It is thought the student - who was only wearing shorts and a jumper - may have climbed into the large bin outside flats in Clifton to escape the cold. A post-mortem investigation found he may have been suffering hypothermia - made worse by the alcohol he consumed that night. But Mr Ogden’s family questioned whether a visual check of whether anyone was in the skip had taken place. His older brother, Philip Ogden told the inquest: 'I have worked for a bin company, and the rules was if it was a town centre and the early hours in the morning we had to check them because of homeless people. 'Every time we came to a bin we had to check.' Anthony Flynn, the bin lorry driver, said he did carry out a visual check of the skip before it was emptied - but it was only possible to see what was on top - not what was within the 8ft long, six feet high skip. Mr Bell, Assistant Coroner for West Yorkshire, gave the inquest verdict as death caused by traumatic asphyxia with alcohol and cannabis intoxication as contributory factors. 'I’m accepting the evidence derived from CCTV that at approximately 4.47am Christopher Ogden entered a skip, seeking shelter and a place to sleep,' he said. 'Christopher was, in essence, the architect of his own misfortune on that particular day. The conclusion I will be formally recording will be one of accidental death, alcohol and drug related.' He said he would be writing to the local council to 'explore the possibility of remedial measures' for binmen to check skips and bins, especially in winter, for people sleeping inside before they are emptied.","Chris Ogden had smoked cannabis before going drinking in Huddersfield .

The policeman blinded by Raoul Moat threatened to hang himself during a video call while his wife was watching, an inquest heard today. But the police family liaison officer who was told about his 'bizarre' threat said she did not believe PC David Rathband would go through with it. DC Alison Brown, who wept as she gave evidence, told the coroner's court how she had been concerned about the wounded policeman in the weeks before he was found dead. The 44-year-old had been left blind and fighting for his life after gunman Raoul Moat shot him twice while he was on the run in July 2010. Threat: PC David Rathband said he would kill himself on FaceTime in front of his wife Kath an inquest heard . He went on to win national praise for . the way he tackled his new disability, creating the Blue Lamp Foundation . to help emergency workers injured at work. But . in February 2012 he was found hanged at the three-storey townhouse in . Blyth, Northumberland, which he had moved into following a domestic . incident with his wife. Giving evidence DC Brown, who worked with the Rathband family after he was shot, said he made the threat to kill himself to his estranged wife Kath. The liaison officer, who said her professional relationship with the family eventually developed into a personal one, said she never thought he would actually kill himself. Mr Rathband threatened to kill himself while on FaceTime - which is Apple's video calling facility, the inquest in Moot Hall, Newcastle, heard. Testimony: DC Alison Brown told the court about PC Rathband's 'bizarre' threat to take his own life . 'She (Kath) said he was thinking of hanging himself and would put his phone onto FaceTime so she could see him doing it,' she said. 'I thought it was such a bizarre thing to say. Saying you're going to hang yourself and do it on FaceTime is bizarre. 'David had never said to me personally . that he had any suicidal thoughts. I knew there was these Twitter posts . and what he said to Kath but he never said anything to me. 'For someone to say that, I just thought it was an awful thing to say. 'I was concerned for his well-being and his mental state but I did not think he would kill himself.' DC Brown contacted PC Rathband while he was in Australia staying with his brother because she was concerned about him. She became worried about some 'random' Tweets the officer sent. DC . Brown said: 'I sent an email to Inspector John Heckles saying I was . concerned about David and he rang me. He planned to pick David up from . the airport when he returned. 'The random tweets were contradictory to the happy family photos that were being posted on Facebook by David’s brother.' While . David was in Australia DC Brown spoke to a friend of David’s, Tony . Horn, and told him something needed to be done to help David but . 'whether he would accept it would be another matter'. Couple: David Rathband with wife Kath Rathband at a charity event in October 2010, before they broke up. The inquest heard he had an affair . Relationship: PC Rathband and 7/7 bombing survivor Lisa French met on Twitter and had an affair, which led to the break-up of his 20-year marriage, the inquest has heard . On the day of David’s death DC Brown was on duty at the Etal Lane police station in Newbiggin Hall, Newcastle. At . around 6.25pm she received a personal message on Facebook from Debbie . Essery, David’s sister, expressing concern after Kath Rathband told her . about David’s state. In the message Mrs Essery told DC Brown that David was 'slowly killing himself.' DC Brown rang Kath Rathband who told her she had found David in his pajamas, looking 'awful'. DC . Brown said: 'At this point I was not concerned for his immediate . safety but I was concerned about his well being and mental state. I . didn’t think that David would hang himself. 'The . fact David did not answer his telephone did not concern me as this had . been typical of his behaviour since moving back to Blyth.' Estranged: Kath Rathband, left, the estranged wife of David Rathband and Lisa French, right, who the officer apparently had an affair with . DCI Nicola Musgrove was informed about the situation in a phone call from CD Brown at 8.04pm, but did not dispatch an officer to David's address until 8.24pm. DCI Musgrove told the court she was 'extremely concerned' for David's welfare despite waiting nearly half an hour to send a police officer to his address. She said she discussed with Superintendent James Napier who would be best to send to David's address to check on his welfare. She said: 'There was a need to check the information first rather than have that information third hand.  Action wasn't put on hold, there was gathering of information. Police activity was going on. 'He had to check that he was ok. We couldn't ignore it but we had to balance it against other information about threats he made in the past. We couldn't guess what the outcome was going to be at that time.' Superintendent James Napier said: 'It was reported by an off duty police officer and friend of the family - that negated the immediacy. Gunman: Raoul Moat shot PC David Rathband while on the run in July 2010 . 'For me there was no immediacy around this situation. This is because Mrs Rathband did not know if these threats were real and the information was incomplete. 'I wanted a swift response, not an immediate response. I wasn't prepared to wait an hour as I knew there would be travelling time and difficulties getting to his house but I wasn't prepared to send an immediate response. 'I wanted more information about what was getting reported and it was getting reported to me that the police were not to be involved. As it was we were involved.' Inspector David Guthrie was sent to David Rathband's house and met with Sgt Patterson and David's welfare officer John Heckles. They gained access at 9.25pm. As he entered the property he heard music playing before seeing 'material hanging down with a dark shape'. Inspector Guthrie said: 'There was a slight delay as I had to call for the enforcer team. I can confirm we forced entry at 9.25pm. 'When we gained entry the three of us identified ourselves and then went upstairs to the first floor. 'I heard music but I was not sure where it was coming from. Then I saw material hanging down with a dark shape. Inspector Heckles ran forward to support his body and I cut the ligature. 'The two paramedics joined us to carry out CPR. Inspector Heckles received a call on his mobile telephone, it was Mrs Rathband that was calling and he left the address. I saw no sign if breathing from David. He appeared lifeless.'

Tragic: Peter Bane, 48, tried calling mental health services three times in the 11 days before his death . The family of a man who threw himself in front of a train after making at least three unanswered calls to the mental health service have been awarded compensation by the NHS. Father-of-three Peter Bane, 48, was being treated for occasional bouts of depression. Two weeks before his death, Mr Bane, a road safety engineer, rang his GP's surgery three times to say he was considering taking his own life. But his calls for help went unanswered as each time receptionists failed to pass the message on to the mental health services. Nearly four years after his death at Witham station in Essex in February 2010, his family have received an undisclosed payout from Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust. The trust accepted that had Mr Bane been . admitted to a psychiatric hospital and given appropriate treatment when . he asked for it, his suicide 11 days later would probably have been . avoided. His widow Angela, 48, from Happisburgh in Norfolk, said: 'Peter was let down when he needed professional help most. 'We continue to be amazed that the Trust had such a poor referral practice in place given the severity of the types of cases receptionists were expected to handle. 'As we hear more and more news about cuts to mental health services and budget restraints, what happened to Peter only goes to show what a poor state many mental health services in the UK are in. 'As a family who lost a loving husband and father because of inadequate procedures that jeopardised the safety of vulnerable people is both infuriating and heartbreaking.' Mrs Bane said she hopes the ruling will change attitudes towards mental health in the NHS: 'We are pleased to hear that the Trust has implemented new procedures to try and prevent any other errors being made but we hope that this will now be rolled out across the UK to ensure no other patient’s safety is compromised in a similar way.' Dr Hadrian Ball, medical director of the trust, said: 'Services have been improved substantially since Mr Bane’s death to reduce the chance of anything similar happening again.

Multi-millionaire Robert Ekaireb, 39, was found guilty last month of killing his wife, Lihau Cao - following a row about her previous work in a lap-dancing club, in October 2006. But it has never been discovered exactly how the 27-year-old died, and police have never found her remains. Ekaireb (left) met Li Hua when she was working as a lap dancer, but became obsessed by her past.   Ekaireb, 39, was found guilty last month of killing his wife, Lihau Cao - following a row about her previous work in a lap-dancing club, in October 2006, and has now been jailed for life . Old Bailey judge Nicholas Cooke described property entrepreneur Ekaireb, of Hendon in north London, as 'a callous, manipulative and selfish hypocrite'. Ekaireb will serve 22 years - minus the 209 days he spent in custody - before being considered for release. The trial had heard Ekaireb lived in Hampstead with his wife who worked as a waitress and dancer in London's Chinatown. The couple had met while Miss Cao, who took the name Lisa, was living in Dublin and working as a lap dancer - a career that defence counsel Michael Skelley said 'tormented' Ekaireb. After a whirlwind romance, the couple married in 2006 - three months before she was killed, the trial heard. But members of the victim's family in her native China became suspicious when they did not hear from her and they reported her missing in February 2007. A jury found Ekaireb guilty of murder last month. Sentencing today, Judge Cooke recalled evidence that the victim was 19 weeks pregnant at the time she was killed. He said: 'This was the murder of a pregnant wife - in that sense you ended two lives. 'I accept that this is a case of no evidence of pre-meditation. It was also a case of extreme domestic violence. Pavilion Court in Hampstead, where the couple shared a one-bedroom flat. The Old Bailey heard Ekarieb had the flat completely re-carpeted and redecorated in the months after his pregnant wife disappeared . 'The evidence is this case exposed you as a callous, manipulative and selfish hypocrite.' Met Police Detective Inspector Andy Manning, who worked on the international investigation, said Ekaireb 'lost control' and killed his wife, before disposing of the body, clearing up and attempting to carry on with his life. He said: 'We will never know how Lihau died or what happened to her body which is a tragedy for her family and her unborn child. Ekaireb will serve 22 years - minus the 209 days he spent in custody - before being considered for release . 'Despite this, the jury has found overwhelming evidence that Ekaireb killed his wife and it is satisfying seven years after her disappearance to reach this conviction today and provide some answers to Lihau's family. 'Lihau clearly wasn't happy in her marriage - Ekaireb was controlling, restricted her access to money despite his immense wealth and often lost his temper. She had spoken to friends and family about leaving him and there is evidence she was preparing to do so for good. 'Detectives continued to work tirelessly to piece together the key events of the last few months of Lihau's life to provide indisputable evidence that Ekaireb had killed her.' The victim's brother, Li Bin Cao, was in court for the verdict but declined to comment after sentencing. In his witness statement, on behalf of his family, he told the court of the anguish which had overcome them since learning of his sister's disappearance. He said: 'It was very hard to grasp and we are struggling to accept the fact that our beloved Lihau is gone forever. 'We will never understand why he (Ekaireb) killed Lihau. She was a social, loving, warm person. 'We will never see her alive again, and even in her death she is missing. 'We don't know how to move on with our lives with no Lihau to bury.' The court heard that the death had had a particularly profound effect on the victim's mother in China, while the family were so fearful of what the news would do to the health of her grandfather that he is yet to be told. The judge said: 'When there is no body, the bereaved will suffer agonies of false hope. 'They are left, potentially permanently, without the ability to grieve in the way the family of those with the body returned to them can grieve.' Mr Skelley said Ekaireb had a long-term partner, a two-year-old child with another baby on the way, and described the death as a double tragedy. The defendant, described by the judge as being of 'considerable wealth', was told to pay costs of Â£120,815.05.","Robert Ekaireb, 39, was found guilty last month of killing his wife, Lihau Cao .

A temporary headteacher billed his school £450 a day and installed CCTV cameras without consulting staff, according to a report. Auditors from Manchester City Council also found five iPhones had been bought at the school without evidence of any business case when they were called in after a whistleblower raised concerns over potential financial irregularities. An interim investigation report highlights a list of ‘significant breaches’ of the school's financial regulations after Paul Jackson was hired as interim headteacher at St Kentigern's Primary School, in Fallowfield, on a consultancy basis in September 2011. The report found Mr Jackson was paid £124,000 for 2011/12 at a rate of £450 a day, including payments for some weekends and school holidays which were not specified in his contract. It also found the relationship between Mr Jackson and school business manager Kathleen Inniss, who had bought two Cheshire houses together worth £474,000, was not declared. The investigators have said more than £4,000 was also paid to Core Communications, co-founded by Mr Jackson's brother Will, for training sessions with no procurement process. Meanwhile, Mrs Inniss bought a 'covert pen camera' using school funds and 15 high-spec ‘inward focused’ CCTV cameras were installed, without any apparent staff consultation. The investigation also found five iPhones paid for by the school at a cost of £2,400-a-year had been allocated to Mr Jackson, Mrs Inniss, her daughter Licia, the school’s inclusion manager and chair of governors Father Tom Connolly, without evidence of any business case. The report states that financial controls at the school were ‘significantly inadequate’ and records incomplete, leaving it open to the ‘risk of error, omission and fraud’, according to the Manchester Evening News. An interim investigation report highlights a list of 'significant breaches' of the school's financial regulations after Paul Jackson was hired as interim headteacher at St Kentigern's Primary School, in Fallowfield, on a consultancy basis in September 2011 . It said: 'In our view the numerous weaknesses in financial controls and governors not being informed of a financial relationship between the headteacher and school business manager left the school vulnerable to the risk of irregularity and allegations of failure to demonstrate or achieve value for money, making poor or perceivably favourable decisions and financial mismanagement.' Mr Jackson, 67, had been the school’s headteacher for more than a decade before retiring in 2010. After being re-hired, auditors found he was paid via his company Paul Jackson Consultancy Ltd and in a number of cases was able to sign-off cheques for payment from the school. The report also states invoices on behalf of the company were often prepared by Mrs Inniss using school computers. Auditors raised concerns that governors had not been made aware of the scale of payments. Investigators were called in on June 21 last year when a number of concerns regarding the voluntary-aided Catholic school were raised to the town hall. Mr Jackson retired for a second time on June 24 along with Fr Connolly, who stepped down from his role as chair of governors. Mrs Inniss agreed to take ‘time off’ on the same day and Ms Inniss, 36, had already left on maternity leave. Both left their roles after being suspended several weeks later. Investigators found Mrs Inniss made three unreported and unauthorised visits to the school on June 23, 24, and 25 outside of school hours - and was joined by Mr Jackson on the 23 and Ms Inniss on the 24. It was later discovered Mr Jackson and Mrs Inniss’s email accounts had large gaps in them and further investigation found the messages were deleted on June 23 and 24. Links between Mr Jackson and London-based training company Core Communications are also being probed. The council investigation found the headteacher did not declare the co-founder of the company was his brother, Will, and there was no evidence of a procurement process. Paul Jackson even appears on the ‘About Us’ section of the company’s website, although it is not clear if he held a position with the firm at the time any contracts were awarded. A final report will be published later this year after information has been provided from third parties, including grant providers and suppliers. Mr Jackson could not be reached for comment and Core Communications failed to respond to calls. A member of Kathleen and Alicia Inniss’s family said the pair did not wish to respond to the findings of the report. Fr Connolly denied any wrongdoing and said he had no knowledge of an iPhone being allocated to him by the school. He said: 'The council has never forgiven us for when we decided to become grant-maintained many years ago and I think this investigation is their revenge for that.' Manchester council said it would not comment on the investigation until the final report is completed.","Paul Jackson hired as interim headteacher at school in September 2011 .

Theresa May has replaced Boris Johnson as favourite to become the next Tory leader, according to a poll of party members. The survey by influential grassroots website ConservativeHome reveals the Home Secretary has beaten the London Mayor into pole position for the first time, after a series of tough interventions on immigration. Of the 800 Tory members polled last month, 22.7 per cent said Mrs May should be the party’s next leader, just ahead of Mr Johnson on 22.6 per cent. After a series of interventions on immigration, Theresa May (left) has beaten the London Mayor for the first time . Other contenders include the Education Secretary Michael Gove, who has repeatedly ruled himself out, on 17 per cent and former leadership contender David Davis on 11 per cent. Despite the economic recovery, just 7 per cent of Tories believe Chancellor George Osborne should succeed David Cameron. But the most startling finding in the poll, one of a regular series by the website, is the growing support for Mrs May whose proportion of the vote has never previously risen above the mid-teens. Paul Goodman, a former Tory MP who edits ConservativeHome, said the results were ‘rather surprising’, given the Government’s problems over immigration. He added: ‘The best explanation is that May’s reputation as an effective, focused and no-nonsense minister continues to grow among party members.’ The Prime Minister's satisfaction rating remains at 21 per cent . Mrs May is regarded as having had a good year, culminating in the deportation of hate preacher Abu Qatada in July last year. She has also flaunted her Right-wing credentials with a number of toughly worded interventions on immigration and human rights. The Home Secretary has refused to rule out standing for leadership in the future, while stressing that she remains loyal to the Prime Minister. The emergence of Mrs May as a serious challenger is a significant setback for Mr Johnson, who has spent years courting party activists. It follows controversy in November when he suggested that attempts to tackle inequality were ‘futile’ because some people were simply not bright enough to ever get ahead in life. Delivering the annual Margaret Thatcher lecture in London, Mr Johnson also hailed the ‘spirit of envy’ – comments which drew widespread criticism. The survey of party members also revealed that Mr Gove and the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith remain the most popular Cabinet ministers, with net satisfaction ratings of 83 per cent and 76 per cent. Satisfaction with Mr Osborne rose dramatically last year as the economy recovered – up to 58 compared to a rating of minus one 12 months ago. But the Prime Minister’s  satisfaction rating remains at just 21 per cent. Mr Goodman said: ‘While Cameron takes the flak for what members see as the leadership’s errors – Romanian and Bulgarian entry, onshore wind farms, same-sex marriage, the growth of UKIP, compromises with the Liberal Democrats – Osborne takes the credit for the recovering economy.’","Survey by ConservativeHome shows Home Secretary has beaten London Mayor for the first time - with 22.7% support ahead of his 22.6% .

The woman, now 39, has tearfully told for the first time how the disgraced It's A Knockout presenter abused her and 'put his tongue in my mouth'. Speaking about reading him excerpts from the book, called the 'gourmet guide to lovemaking', she said as an innocent 12-year-old she began to blush and became very upset because it was so sexually graphic. Shame: Stuart Hall, 83, who was jailed for 15 months, asked a 12-year-old victim to read him the Joy of Sex in his BBC dressing room, the woman involved said today . It came as yesterday Hall, 83, was told he would serve barely two weeks in prison for each of the young girls he sexually abused. The sentence prompted a wave of . outrage and fury, with victims saying it made a mockery of . their horrific ordeal and politicians and campaigners condemning it as . 'incredibly lenient'. He was jailed for 15 months after admitting that he indecently assaulted 13 girls between . 1967 and 1986. His youngest victim was nine. Hall targeted the new victim who spoke out today how she was invited to the BBC Manchester studios with a friend after he approached them at a petrol station. At the time he presented North West Tonight and told staff the girls were his 'nieces' and he was giving them elocution lessons - a way he managed to target children and young girls over several decades. Two years after he had forced her read him the graphic sex manual, Hall targeted her again on the set of Children in Need,  when she was 14, and began feeding her champagne. 'Then he kissed me on the lips and put his tongue in my mouth. It was gross. I felt sick afterwards,' she told The Sun. Jailed: A court sketch showing Hall in the dock as he was sentenced to 15 months in prison .

'We . were going to turn 16 and he kept telling us to come and see him when . we did. Obviously we didn't. Looking back it was all part of the . grooming process.' The BBC said yesterday it was 'appalled that . some of Stuart Hall's crimes took place in connection with his work at . the BBC and offers an unreserved apology to the people he abused'. Under sentencing rules Hall will be . released automatically after serving just half the term and the Attorney . General has already been forced to agree to review the sentence after . being inundated with complaints. He was last night examining whether it was 'unduly lenient' and should be referred back to the Court of Appeal. Guilty: The former It's A Knockout presenter initially denied the charges and told police his victims were lying before pleading guilty . Politicians . and child protection charities were among those who condemned the . former BBC presenter's sentence, saying it sent the wrong message to . victims of historic sex abuse following the Jimmy Savile scandal. When . Hall was first arrested last December, he told police his victims were . all lying as part of a 'vendetta going on against people in the public . eye'. But the publicity . led to more women coming forward, and in April the married father of two . finally admitted 14 counts of indecent assault. The pleas could only be . revealed last month, after reporting restrictions were lifted. Last . night two of the women who helped bring the predator to justice led the . condemnation of his sentence. The pair waived their legal right to . anonymity in the Daily Mail last month. Susan .

'I feel that the sentence should have been higher especially taking into account the age of some of his victims.' The mother of one added: 'His lenient . sentence will not act as deterrent to others who go on to sexually abuse . youngsters. I am pretty shocked by it and feel that he has almost . walked free and it has made a mockery of what the victims have been . through. 'This is after all his denials and . calling us all liars and the claims spurious, callous and cruel – he has . never personally apologised for what he has done and he is not . remorseful.'

It seems Farrah Abraham has learned the hard way that getting on the wrong side of Charlie Sheen is not a good idea. The angry Anger Management actor has slammed the Teen Mom star in a rather humiliating open letter. Farrah shared text messages between the pair which showed them planning a date, and Charlie is furious at her for leaking the conversation. A bit embarrassing: Charlie Sheen has slammed Farrah Abraham in an open letter published on TMZ.com . The 47-year-old branded the 22-year-old a ‘desperate guzzler of stagnant douche agua’ in a note published on TMZ.com. Charlie told the former reality star: 'I truly do not recall giving you permission to globally reveal any communication between us. congrats on surviving your lobotomy and an even bigger congratz on the recent attempt at porn.' He went on to tell her ‘your daughter must be so proud’ and expressed very sternly that he never wants to hear from her again. ‘Please send my number to middle earth and if allowed, eagerly follow it into said abyss and slam the door behind you,’ he wrote. Furious: Charlie is annoyed at Farrah, pictured on Wednesday, for sharing text messages exchanged between them . 'The world will collectively sigh as the pungent memory of you vanishes into the pedestrian troposphere of lame-suck and zero-life. Oh and I'm sure they'll wave the cover charge when they see your tranny-boobs and five o'clock shadow.' It came after Farrah reached out to the actor in May saying she would like to meet him and score a role on his show Anger Management. Farrah sent the star a longwinded and frankly embarrassing series of text messages, one of which said; ‘Just wanted to say I was excited to meet you if anger management ever ends up booking me, but idk if that will happen … . ‘So I just felt like saying your super funny and would love to meet you at some point & I’m in town alot & hopefully soon will move to the area and maybe we can meet up for a play date with our children or if your cool just for coffee and relaxing let me know. [sic]’ Not happy: Charlie told the Teen Mom star to 'send his number to middle earth' and added that she should 'follow it' Farrah added: ‘This week I’m doing appearances & other work and could only meet later so – All the best & hope your having a great week.’ Charlie seemed keen on the idea at the time, and wrote back: ‘You sound fabulous! Coffee is for amateurs and grandma… would love to get together!!’ The redheaded sex tape star followed up a few days later, asking Charlie if he wanted to come with her to a party with some ‘porn star ppl’ if he felt ‘comfortable’. While Charlie may have been open to the idea of meeting Farrah a month ago, the former Two And A Half Men star has done a complete 180. And his colourfully worded letter has in turn irritated Farrah, who responded to Charlie via a letter on Radar Online.

David Cameron has indicated he is ‘perfectly happy’ for him and his family to eat genetically modified foods that have been deemed safe by watchdogs. Sources close to the Prime Minister said he took the same view as Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who said this week that he had eaten GM foods and would happily feed his children a genetically modified tomato. As the Government launched a push to end an effective ban on GM products in British supermarkets, Downing Street repeatedly declined to say whether Mr Cameron would eat them or give them to his family. But yesterday a source close to the Prime Minister told the Mail: ‘Of course he would happily eat GM products that have been through proper procedures. ‘Anyone who has ever eaten a meal in the United States has almost certainly eaten GM, since almost all the soya produced there has been genetically modified for many years. ‘The point is we can’t carry on damning an entire technology as “Frankenstein foods”. Surely the sensible thing is to judge each product on its merits or demerits.’ Mr Paterson prompted a row with critics of GM foods this week when he insisted that they are safer than those produced using conventional farming methods. He blamed European resistance to the technology for depriving the Third World of products such as ‘golden rice’, which is engineered to contain high levels of vitamin A to help prevent blindness. Grub's up: David Cameron, pictured eating a pie at Borough Market, seems not to be worried about GM produce . Controversy: Environment secretary Owen Paterson viewing a genetically modified crop trial in Hertfordshire . Ministers claim British farmers and scientists are being forced to work with ‘one hand tied behind their backs’ because of an effective moratorium on GM products, which has been in place since they became the focus of controversy in the 1990s. Mr Paterson insisted there was ‘no scientific evidence associating GMOs [genetically modified organisms] with higher risks’ for the environment or human health. He said studies showed that the use of ‘more precise technology and the greater regulatory scrutiny probably makes GMOs even safer than conventional plants and food’. Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, said it was ‘hard to take lessons on science’ from Mr Paterson and added that biotechnology not using genetic modification was already making a ‘real difference’.","Government pushing to end effective ban on GM products in supermarkets .

Postmen are poised to boycott delivery of half the country’s letters, leaving Britain’s mail system on the brink of chaos. An overwhelming majority voted for the measure, which raises the prospect of urgent mail such as debit cards, gas bills and bank statements being abandoned at Royal Mail delivery offices. One in two letters delivered each day are handled by one of Royal Mail’s rivals, TNT Post and UK Mail, which print their insignia on the envelope. Fury: A union ballot of Royal Mail staff has displayed their anger at plans to privatise the company. Workers could also refuse to work with competitor mail firms . Royal Mail is responsible only for the ‘final mile’ of the delivery –  that is, putting the letter through  your letterbox. In a consultative ballot, the . Communication Workers’ Union asked its members if they supported ‘the . boycott of competitors’ mail’. Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, says the message from Royal Staff to the Government is 'loud and clear' The results, published yesterday, were . clear. Of the 112,414 ballot papers which were sent out, 75,662 came . back with a ‘yes’, equal to a vote of 67 per cent. Just 6,996 said ‘no’. Yesterday the CWU did not name a date . for the boycott to begin, but warned it could last indefinitely. Its . impact could be devastating. Many of Britain’s biggest companies . use the services of Royal Mail’s rivals, including Santander, Barclays, . Lloyds Banking Group, Tesco, Npower, Sky, E.On, Thames Water and . TalkTalk. Royal Mail delivers around 58million . letters every day. The workers’ boycott would be unlawful if it went ahead in the next week - thanks to a High Court ruling. But if it eventually goes ahead, mountains of mail could . pile up in delivery offices around the country. CWU members were also . overwhelmingly against the privatisation of Royal Mail, with 70 per cent . of those balloted saying they were ‘opposed’. Ministers are planning to float the . business on the stock market, a move which even Margaret Thatcher . opposed. She said she was ‘not prepared to have the Queen’s head . privatised’. They have pledged to give 10 per cent . of Royal Mail shares to its workers, but the CWU yesterday dismissed the . prospect of free, or discounted, shares. Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of . the CWU, said: ‘Postal workers are not going to sacrifice their souls . for a so-called 10 per cent stake when they know their jobs, pensions . and conditions are once again under threat.’ Until January 2006, Royal Mail had a . monopoly on all mail in this country. Since this was axed, it has . rapidly lost its key business customers. A statement from Royal Mail said any industrial action could not only hurt the company financially but are also unlawful . At present, ‘around half of the daily . post bag’ is made up of mail which has been handled by a rival, . according to Royal Mail. Last year, TNT handled 3.8billion letters, . compared with 1.1billion in 2006. UK Mail said it handled around . 2.7billion. 'Postal workers are not going to sacrifice their souls for a so-called 10 per cent stake when they know their jobs, pensions and conditions are once again under threat' Dave Ward, Communication Workers' Union . Royal Mail is obliged to deliver every piece of mail to every address in the country, however remote. But its rivals can simply cherry  pick . the best contracts, such as a high-street banking giant, without ever . having to worry about getting a second-class postcard from Cornwall to . Carlisle, for example. Many people already use the internet . to access their mobile phone and bank accounts. And yesterday a Royal . Mail spokesman warned the boycott would further encourage the public to . ditch letters in favour of emails. He said: ‘Any action against letters . [handled by rivals] and parcels would adversely impact on large numbers . of the general public and the postal industry as a whole by increasing . e-substitution. It would also severely impact on our business, our . reputation and that of our employees.’ Fears: The union says workers' jobs, pensions and conditions would be under threat if the privatisation plans went ahead .

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 02:41 EST, 20 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:16 EST, 20 June 2013 . Claim: Jeremiah Adebolajo says he was approached in Saudi Arabia after his brother Michael had been arrested in Kenya (pictured) trying to get to Somalia to fight for rebels . British spies approached the brother of Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo more than ten times to convince him to work for the security services, it emerged today. Jeremiah Adebolajo said MI5 and MI6 'harassed' him and tried to press him for details about his family before putting him on a 'no-fly list' when he refused. The 26-year-old was first approached in 2011 when he moved to Saudi Arabia to teach English at the University of Ha'il, in NeJd. He held 11 meetings with both MI5 and MI6, both in the Gulf and also in the UK, including on one occasion where he was intercepted as he got off a flight at Heathrow. As well as asking questions about his brother Michael, 28, spies had also pressed him on  his brother-in-law, James Thompson, who had converted to Islam and married his sister. They also asked him to identify other men who had gone to the Yemen and may have been plotting to attack Britain, but he said he didn't know them. Previously it had been alleged that Jeremiah was paid thousands of pounds by MI6 as part of spying operations in the Middle East, and was allowed to fly first-class and stay in five-star hotels. This was revealed in a document allegedly written by Jeremiah’s sister, Blessing Adebolajo, 32, which was seen earlier this month. It was also alleged he was also asked to help ‘turn’ his brother, Michael, to work for MI5, who were already aware of Michael’s close links to extremist groups after he was arrested on his way to Somalia to join terror group Al-Shabaab. Workplace: Jeremiah Adeboljao was working at the University of Ha'il in Saudi Arabia when he was approached by MI6 . Complaint: A redacted copy of the allegations made by the Adebolajo family about the approaches made by the security services. Jeremiah said this account as untrue . 'That’s not true in any way.  I mean it’s completely false.  I can . understand what it’s based on, them approaching me while I was in Saudi . Arabia, but the claim I worked for them helped them or co-operated with . them in any way is false,' Jeremiah Adebolajo told ITV News. 'I felt harassed. I felt there was no choice but to meet them whenever . they wanted to meet me to speak to them whenever they wanted to speak to . me...Their claim was that I had been in contact with, spoken with, met . in my time in England with people who they were interested in.' Government sources have already confirmed that Michael Adebolajo was known to MI5. It was alleged that he rebuffed efforts by the security service to recruit him as a spy. Older sister: Blessing Adebolajo had allegedly said her brother Jeremiah was approached by MI6 and asked to become an informant . Jeremiah may have been seen as the ideal way to change his mind and said last night that they tried hard to influence him. 'I would say that their approach wasn’t so much aggressive as it was threatening. I mean there were implicit threats made towards my welfare towards my time in Saudi Arabia, whether I would be able to retain my job, um, so in short I’d say their approach was worrying somewhat,' he said. Speaking about how often they met, both in the UK and Saudi Arabia, he said: 'I’d say they were about at the beginning, they were you know, at least once a month and over the two years they lessened somewhat, but they would be at unexpected times and I would say once every two to three months, yeah.' When asked about the execution of Lee Rigby and the alleged link to his brother Michael and Michael Adebowale, 22, he said: 'Legally I can’t speak about it.'","Jeremiah Adebolajo claims spies wanted information on his family .

An Orlando police sergeant is claiming gender, age and disability discrimination after she says she was fired because breast implants she'd received while recovering from breast cancer prevented her from wearing a bulletproof vest. Master Sergeant Rhonda Huckelberry, a 25-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, has filed a lawsuit against the department after it fired her for failing to wear the vest, despite Huckelberry's being allowed to work without a vest on doctor's orders for the last 17 years. Following her dismissal, Huckelberry was brought back for light duty. Orlando Sergeant Rhonda Huckelberry claims she is the victim of age, gender and disability discrimination . Until three years ago, Huckelberry was a supervisor on the department's tactical crime unit, according to WFTV in Orlando. However, after a controversial officer-involved shooting, she was kicked out of the unit following a bad review from a supervisor. In 2010, the tactical crime unit - which normally investigates violent crimes - was ordered by Huckelberry to arrest a man in a Target parking lot. According to a federal lawsuit first obtained by WFTV, Huckelberry suspected one of the men of stealing her husband's credit card, which is why she ordered the TCU to arrest him. Leadership problems: Huckelberry blames Orlando Police Chief Paul Rooney's poor leadership as the reason for her firing . During the bust, however, suspect Rogelio Cortes tried to flee in a truck and was shot four times by officers. Authorities later claimed that he tried to ram them with the truck, but video surveillance footage of the incident showed that Cortes' truck was rammed by an Orlando Police Department patrol car, which pushed him towards the officers, which prompted them to open fire. After the shooting, Cortes was charged with theft and attempted murder of an officer - charges that were later dropped. Huckelberry was cleared of all wrongdoing in the shooting, and Orlando Police Chief Paul Rooney said the officers had a right to shoot because it appeared the suspect was trying to flee. Since Huckelberry's poor review following the shooting, she claims that every assignment she's requested has been given to a younger, male officer. Huckelberry blames Rooney's poor leadership for the alleged discrimination.","Orlando Sergeant Rhonda Huckelberry claims she is the victim of age, gender and disability discrimination .

Heart-healthy: Using vegetable oil instead of animal fats could slow down the spread of prostate cancer . Swapping to vegetable oils and nuts may increase a man’s chances of surviving prostate cancer. A study found that those diagnosed with the disease early had a lower risk of the cancer spreading if they replaced animal fats found in processed foods – such as cake and pastries – with healthy vegetable fats. One serving of oil-based salad dressing a day, equivalent to one tablespoon, was linked with a 29 per cent lower risk of potentially lethal prostate cancer and a 13 per cent lower chance of dying from any cause. The US authors stressed the research involving 4,577 prostate cancer patients had revealed an association and could not necessarily prove a diet rich in oils and nuts was the cause. In an online paper published by the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, they wrote: ‘Overall, our findings support counselling men with prostate cancer to follow a heart-healthy diet in which carbohydrate calories are replaced with unsaturated oils and nuts to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality.’ Of the men with prostate cancer enrolled into the study, around a fifth died from the disease over a period of about eight years. Another 31 per cent died from heart disease and almost 21 per cent from other cancers. At the time they were recruited, all the men had non-metastatic prostate cancer, meaning the disease had not yet spread. Information about the patients’ dietary habits was collected from questionnaires. Swapping animal fats and carbohydrates for healthy vegetable fats, including olive and canola oil as well as oils from nuts, seeds and avocados, was found to have a significant impact on disease progression and death. The study found oils from nuts, seeds and avocados were found to have a significant impact on disease progression and death . Men who replaced 10 per cent of their daily carbohydrate consumption with vegetable fats had a 29 per cent lower risk of developing deadly prostate cancer and a 26 per cent reduced risk of dying from any cause. The study also showed that eating an ounce of nuts a day led to an 18 per cent lower risk of lethal prostate cancer and an 11 per cent lower risk of death. Dr Erin Richman, from the University of California at San Francisco, said: ‘Consumption of healthy oils and nuts increases plasma (blood) antioxidants and reduces insulin and inflammation, which may deter prostate cancer progression.’","Study finds lower risk of cancer spreading if processed foods are replaced .

Police were called out to Ariel Castro's block more than 1,000 times during the period he is alleged to have held young women captive at his house . Police visited Ariel Castro's block more than 1,000 during the period he allegedly held young women captive - and his house was one of the quietest in a chaotic neighborhood. From August 2002 to May this year, when the women emerged from the Cleveland, Ohio house, police were called out to the block roughly once every three days. Most calls were to report crimes, according to police records. Castro's house, 2207 Seymour Avenue, was one of the quietest, reports NBC News, with officers attending his home only twice during the time Michelle Knight, Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry were missing. The first police visit was in January 2004, when police interviewed Castro about a complaint that he left a young boy on the school bus he drove while he ate at a branch of Wendy's. The second, in July 2009, was when Castro reported a fight on the street. There is no suggestion that police missed crucial signs that could have led them to the missing women. Some neighbors claimed they had told police that women were naked and chained-up in the back yard during the period Knight, DeJesus and Berry were missing. But police say they have no records of these reports while the women themselves said they only went outside twice, wearing wigs and sunglasses. One house on Seymour Avenue, which has 16 houses and two apartment blocks, was visited 68 times by police while numbers 2115 and 2003 racked up 37 and 35 visit respectively. Crime reports included calls about domestic abuse, flashers and vandalism. Today: Attorney Craig Weintraub addressed the death penalty issue after his client, 52-year-old Ariel Castro, pleaded not guilty to hundreds of charges including rape and kidnapping . One 2006 fight involved 20 people armed with baseball bats, which led to the hospitalization of a pregnant woman. Community organiser Khalid Samad . described the neighborhood on the night the women emerged from the . Castro house as an example of the day-to-day life on the area. He told NBC: 'Not an hour after they're out, I'm standing on the street near the Castro house and a fight broke out a few doors down because a guy who was out there saw a guy who he recognized as having shot him on the street. 'Dude took off running, and they're wrestling down in front of the church. That's the kind of thing that would go on there.' Last week Castro pleaded not guilty to 329 . counts, including 139 counts of rape, 177 counts of kidnapping, seven . counts of gross sexual imposition, three counts of felonious assault and . one count of possession of criminal tools. Investigators are checking new . evidence found in the house where he allegedly kept three women chained . up for more than ten years, to determine if there were other victims. Ohio . investigators have been searching for evidence of other girls kept at . the house or signs of aborted fetuses since Amanda Berry's escape from Castro in May. The . nature and source of the evidence has not yet been released but . Attorney General Mike DeWine said it was normal in a case like this for . additional evidence to be gathered. Shackled and dressed in an orange prison uniform, Cleveland 'House of Horrors' suspect Ariel Castro pleaded not guilty today and the defense hinted that a trial can be avoided with a plea if he escapes the death penalty . Flanked: Ariel Castro, center, stands before a judge with his defense attorney's, Jaye Schlachet, left, and Craig Weintraub during his arraignment on Wednesday, June 12 . 'We are well on our way. We've . processed a lot of the evidence already. We have a ways to go, but we're . making very good progress with it,' he said. The 52-year-old's charges cover August . 2002, when he is said to have kidnapped his first victim, Michelle . Knight, to February 2007. More charges could be added to his file, as police investigate the kidnap of Miss Berry, Miss Knight, and Gina DeJesus, who was 14 when she was snatched on her way home from school. The indictment alleges the former school bus driver held the women chained to a pole in a basement, or to a bedroom heater or inside a van. It says that when one of the women tried to escape Castro, who is being held on $8billion bail, assaulted her by wrapping a vacuum cord around her neck. As well as fathering a child with Miss Berry, Castro allegedly impregnated Miss Knight on five occasions but would punch her in the stomach until she had a miscarriage. Held captive: Amanda Berry, left, and Gina DeJesus, right, were found living in appalling conditions . Tragic: Michelle Knight was allegedly brutalized by Ariel Castro and beaten so badly that she needs facial reconstruction surgery . Locked up: Ariel Castro, pictured on May 9, will plead not guilty today after been indicted on 329 charges including murder, plus multiple counts of rape, gross sexual imposition and felonious assault . At his arraignment on Wednesday, the grand jury charged Castro with two counts of aggravated murder related to one act, saying he purposely caused the unlawful termination of one of the women's pregnancies. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty has said that he would seek the death penalty for Castro. One of the former bus driver's attorneys, Craig Weintraub, said however that Castro would be willing to plead guilty to some of the charges and forgo a trial in exchange for a deal that would spare him a death sentence, the Ohio Plain Dealer reported. Scene: Deputies sit outside the Cleveland home where Castro allegedly kept the women for years . A statement issued on behalf of the women said days like Castro's arraignment 'are not easy' and added: 'We are hopeful for a just and prompt resolution.

Forensic experts say it is common for DNA samples to be crosschecked to see if there are other victims or people involved in a crime, according to CNN.","Castro's house, 2207 Seymour Avenue, was only visited twice by police .

Deen has become an . internationally-renowned chef, thanks to her numerous Food Network TV . shows, including 'Paula's Home Cooking' and 'Paula's Party'. She has . become known for her charm and quick-witted Southern banter. The . lawsuit alleges Deen hired Jackson to plan her brother's wedding and . then told her: 'What I would really like is a bunch of little n******s . to wear long-sleeve white shirts, black shorts and black bow ties. Now, . that would be a true Southern wedding wouldn't it?' Deen denied that she has used in the N-word in that context - or any time in the last several years. However, she admitted she loved the idea of having only older black men dressed in Civil War-era house-slave garb serve guests. She got the idea from a restaurant that she and her husband ate at in North Carolina or Tennessee. 'The whole entire wait staff was middle-aged black men, and they had on beautiful white jackets and a black bow tie. I mean it was really impressive,' she said. 'And I remember saying I would love to have servers like that, but I would be afraid somebody would misinterpret.' By 'somebody,' Deen meant the media, which was covering the lavish wedding. 'It just wasn't worth it,' she said. Family: Bubba, left, allegedly made repeated sexual jokes in front of co-workers . Despite allegations that she had used . the N-word on several occasions in front of Jackson, Deen denied that . she used racial slurs. She also denied harboring any racial bias or telling racist jokes. 'Things . have changed since the 60s in the South. My children and my brother . object to that word being used in any cruel or mean behavior,' she said. However, she later admitted, she wouldn't necessarily object if someone told a racist joke in her home. 'It's just what they are, they're jokes,' she said. '... They usually target a group. Gays, straights, black, redneck, you knew. I just can't myself determine what offends another person. She also dismissed men looking at pornography on work computers or on their phones as 'just men being men'. When asked whether she had used the N-word herself, she said 'of course' she had. She recalled one time after a black man robbed the bank where she was working as a teller and held a gun to her head in the 1980s. She said she referred to the man by the N-word when she recounted the story to her husband later that night. She also said she had used the word when she was recounting a conversation between two black people. Inspiration: . Paula's husband Mr Groover (pictured in 2011) apparently visited the . restaurant that gave his wife the idea of hosting 'a plantation wedding' Deen also admitted to referring to a teenage girl who worked for her by crude slang. She said she had just fired a manager who was having sex with the girl and told him: 'If you think I've worked this hard to lose everything because of a piece of p****, you better think again.' She doesn't regret using the word. 'I said it that day and I would say it again today, it it applied,' she said . Deen also admitted to knowing that her brother had been admitted to rehab for substance abuse 25 years ago. She said her brother 'liked to drink,' but denied he had trouble with drugs or alcohol. She also denied knowing about a cocaine use that was alleged against Bubba. Bubba is accused of showing women he worked with pornography and openly viewing it at the restaurant. The 5'6'' matriarch recently made the headlines by ditching her calorie-laden favorites and opting for healthier foods.","Paula Deen under fire earlier this week when a lawsuit revealed she used racial slurs and wanted a 'plantation-style' wedding .

"By . Professor Iain Stewart . PUBLISHED: . 07:14 EST, 22 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:20 EST, 22 June 2013 . Today we are familiar with our . continents being scattered across the globe, but 250 million years ago . they were part of one 'supercontinent'. Here TV geologist Professor Iain . Stewart tells how the history of the 'supercontinent' is responsible . for koalas being native only to Australia and llamas to only South . America, but also, most importantly, how the 'supercontinent' brought . about the invention of sex... We geologists are an odd bunch. We travel through lands that don't exist. The gateway to these imagined lands are the rocks underfoot. They are portals to the past. No need for a Tardis or fancy time machine - just a hand lens and a hammer can teleport us back to ancient geological times. The ancestral Earths we geologists inspect are very different from the familiar geography of the present. Today, our great land masses are scattered across the globe, but repeatedly in our planet's history they have clumped together as vast agglomerations - supercontinents. Supercontinents come together every 500 million years or so, as armadas of land assemble, weld, founder and disperse. The most recent great continental union occurred 250 million years ago. Scroll down for video . Professor Iain Stewart (pictured at Salar de Uyuni - the world's largest salt flat which is in Bolivia) is presenting a TV series on plate tectonics - Rise Of The Continents - which is showing on BBC2 at 9pm on Sundays. Salar de Uyuni holds 50 per cent of the world's lithium which was created by the uplift of the Andes . Geologists give it the name Pangaea, meaning 'all Earth', but it lasted only 100 million years. Its break-up would give us the scattered continents of today. But more than that, the rise and fall of Pangaea would shape our modern world in the most surprising ways. For a start, the continental couplings that first gave birth to Pangaea played a critical role in one of the most important evolutionary developments in the story of life - the invention of sexual intercourse. The evidence is preserved in the walls of one of the planet's geological wonders, the Grand Canyon. The strata in this gorge span more than a billion years of time, but it is the uppermost rock layers that track the slow death of an ancient ocean as continents coalesced. The grey muds of shallow seas, then coastal deltas pass up into the distinctive red sands of continental Pangaea. Among the windblown ripples are footprints which showed that some critters thrived in this new arid wasteland. Not amphibians, which up until this point had been the dominant animals on the planet. But reptiles. Professor Iain Stewart crosses the Kali Gandaki river in Nepal, one of Eurasia's great rivers and a place where you can find clues to how the Himalayan mountain range was formed . A clue to why the ancestors of . alligators and crocodiles quickly adapted to the vast Pangaean desert . lies in the way they have sex. Now, gator sex is pretty much like human . sex; a tad more brutish and noisy perhaps, but with the same style of . copulation - internal fertilisation. For amphibians, fertilisation is a . messy and haphazard business involving eggs being released in rivers and . ponds. In reptiles, the sperm is delivered inside the female direct to . the ova. The embryos grow within protective shells filled with . life-sustaining amniotic juices. Young reptiles didn't need external . water to develop. The hard, impermeable egg was the revolution. It was the great Pangaean desert that kick-started an evolutionary chain reaction that would lead, eventually, to us. The Grand Canyon reveals that 300 million years ago the U.S. was the western edge of a vast desert. The image shows 1.2 billion years of history at the Grand Canyon being unveiled in the morning sun . Mammals would evolve to take those . life-supporting fluids inside their bodies and supply nutrition through a . placenta, but we're still children of that first amniotic reptile. Pangaea, or rather its demise, is . responsible for the survival one of our favourite animals, the koala, in . an extremely fortunate way. Two hundred and one million years ago - the date is now quite specific - Pangaea began to break up. Huge splits tore at its centre, and its mosaic of land masses began to unravel and separate. First, South America eased away from Africa. Later, giant splits set loose the combined bulk of Antarctica and Australia. Iain Stewart gets up close and personal with a living link to Pangaean times. Alligators are the closest living relative to the reptiles that roamed the land 300 million years ago. These­ reptiles thrived because of an evolutionary advance we have all inherited ­- internal fertilisation . Professor Iain Stewart with a koalla at Cleland Wildlife Park, Adelaide. He discovers the kaola isn't a bear at all - it's bear like face is a direct consequence of the movement of the Australian continent . Released from Pangaea, the conjoined twins of Antarctica and Australia were a single southern expanse of lush forest - an ark of biodiversity adrift in the southern ocean. But their union lasted only until around 90 million years ago, when the first tensions appeared. The divorce, when it finally happened, saw a rift send Australia north into ever drier environments, while Antarctica was left to languish in polar isolation. Life aboard these two giant crustal rafts was destined for very different fates. While cold and ice gradually claimed the flourishing forests of Antarctica, fire and drought devastated Australia's rich cargo of life. But for one unlikely animal, Australia's climatic transformation was salvation. The koala has a remarkably small brain, which perhaps explains why early on in its evolution it made a dumb decision, striking an exclusive partnership with one type of tree. Eucalyptus trees have leaves that are almost devoid of nourishment, which is why koalas are basically cuddly chewing machines, constantly consuming eucalyptus leaves to survive. Professor Stewart with a baby llama, in Bolivia. Llamas are a clue to the final act in the geological story of the Americas ­- they originated in North America and only came south when the two landmasses joined three million years ago . Iain Stewart in the Himalayas -  mountains that were formed as India collided with the rest of the continent. This was a key step in the formation of Eurasia . The eucalyptus tree turned out to be perfectly suited to the parched, flammable conditions that crept over Australia. And so rather than being an evolutionary dead-end, the koala thrived. Conservationists may argue just how well koalas are doing today but, compared to the other creatures they shared the southern Pangaean forests with, they are sitting pretty. Llamas are other cuddly animals who have benefited from continental drift in a surprising way.Since Inca times the llama has been the heart of Andean culture - the animal's wool, meat, even blood all highly prized. These animals are magnificently adapted to the thin air of the high Andean mountains, with supersized hearts and lungs, and arteries packed with oxygen-enriched blood. But there is something surprising about this iconic South America animal. Llamas aren't from this continent at all. They evolved in the low plains of North America. Iain Stewart with an ammonite fossil he found in the Kali Gandaki river in Nepal. This is evidence that the Himalayas, the highest mountains in the world, once formed the bottom of an ocean . At the summit of the volcanic island of Stromboli Iain Stewart reveals the process that built Eurasia and will one bring all the Earth's contents together to form one vast 'supercontinent' Three million years ago, when the decoupled halves of the Americas finally fused, a great exchange of animal life crossed the narrow land bridge of Panama. Along with the llamas, nearly half of South America's animals emigrated from the north. Geologists call it the Great American Interchange, but it was a rather one-side swapsie. Few of the South America species - heavily adapted to Amazonian rainforest - fancied the harsher, colder conditions that awaited them north of Mexico. The rejoining of the Americas was the final major installment in the coming together of the familiar world we know today. Populating that world would begin with a bunch of homo sapiens leaving Africa just 150,000 years ago. As modern humans spread across the globe, civilisation took root in each of the far-flung land masses. Today, a great global economy binds all the disparate continents together. In essence we've created a new Pangaea - a Pangaea of our own making.

You’re not alone – and it could be thanks to low vitamin D levels after our run of gloomy weather, according to research. Scientists found the ‘sunshine vitamin’ charges up our mitochondria – the batteries of the cells. An estimated 60 per cent of the population suffer from vitamin D deficiency. But a spell of sunshine lets us produce the vitamin, which helps our muscles work more efficiently. Benefits: A spell in the sun can top up your batteries and leave you feeling more energetic . Scientists say about 90 per cent of our vitamin D intake comes from sunlight. And a team of researchers saw exhausted patients report a dramatic rise in energy levels when they started taking vitamin D supplements. Dr Akash Sinha, who led the study, said: ‘We have proved for the first time a link between vitamin D and mitochondria function. ‘Of the patients I see, around 60 per cent are vitamin D deficient. Lacklustre: Working indoors all day with little chance of seeing sunshine can create muscle fatigue . Rich source: Vitamin D can also be found in egg yolks, fish and supplements . 'Most people living north of Manchester will struggle to process enough vitamin D from sunlight alone. ‘However a simple vitamin D tablet could help to boost your energy levels - from within the cells.’ While it has a well-established association with helping in bone formation and a deficiency can lead to rickets, its role in other health issues is just emerging.

Record-breaker: Unlike the cartoon sailor, 'the real-life Popeye' Moustafa Ismail is actually allergic to spinach . Weakness: The muscleman said the iron-rich plant is to him what kryptonite is to Superman . International recognition: Big Mo's incredible physique has earned him dozens of trips around the world . Mr Ismail, who entered the Guinness World Book of Records last year as the man with the world's largest biceps, added: 'I like chicken and beef - anything but spinach.' The bodybuilder is the toast of his hometown Alexandria, which he left to move to America in 2007 to find better gym equipment. He said he was fat as a child growing up in the Middle East but had returned home as 'the Hulk'.

One is a black soul singer known on this side of the Atlantic for little more than a  one-off hit in the early 1980s. The other plots the course of the British economy as Chancellor of the Exchequer and, as far as we know, restricts his singing to the shower. Still, when you are the leader of the free world, it is easy to get mixed up on small details. Barack Obama repeatedly referred to George Osborne as ‘Jeffrey’ during G8 meetings this week in an embarrassing blow for the Chancellor. Scroll down for videos . Spot the difference: George Osborne (right) was repeatedly referred to as 'Jeffrey' by US President Barack Obama, who confused him with favourite R&B singer Jeffrey Osborne (left) Confused: US President Obama later apologised to the Chancellor for getting in a muddle about his name . Singer: The Chancellor ruled out a duet, with colleagues confirming his talents lie elsewhere . The US President mixed Mr Osborne up . with his favourite soul singer Jeffrey Osborne, who today offered to . duet with the top Tory. But George Osborne responded today on Twitter, writing: ' Jeff you wouldn't suggest a duet if you'd heard me sing.' Mr Osborne jetted into the second day of the G8 summit in Northern Ireland, determined to impress the world’s most powerful leaders with his plan to get tough with global tax dodgers. But his pride suffered a major setback when the leader of the free world got him confused with R&B star Jeffrey Osborne – who most famously sang the 1980s hit One The Wings Of Love. Mr Obama called him ‘Jeffrey’ three times, to the visible embarrassment of the Chancellor. ‘It was obvious Osborne didn’t  like being called “Jeffrey”,’ said a government source. ‘Why would he? His name is George.’ In fact the Chancellor’s real name is Gideon Oliver Osborne but switched to George aged 13 as a ‘small act of rebellion’. Today the soul singer said he was delighted to get a namecheck at the G8 summit. And in a bizarre twist suggested singing a duet up with the Chancellor. Jeffrey Osborne told Sky News: 'I was really delighted, actually. I was really not aware that he was that much of a fan that he would call the Chancellor Jeffrey Osborne. 'Tell the Chancellor when I come over I will have to hook up with him and we will do a duet of On The Wings Of Love, or something.' Jeffrey Osborne's entry in online encyclopaedia Wikipedia was edited by a mischievous user to reflect Mr Obama's inadvertent appointment of the singer to the Treasury. After being tampered with, the entry read: 'Jeffrey Linton Osborne (born March 9, 1948) is an American funk and R&B musician, songwriter, lyricist, former lead singer of the band, L.T.D., and as of June 2013, is the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Second Lord of the Treasury of the United Kingdom.' The bogus information remained online for under an hour before being erased. Unattractive: David Cameron welcomed the US President to Lough Erne, but Mr Obama joked that Nick Clegg was the better=looking half of the coalition . Joke: Mr Osborne failed the see the funny side of the President's slip-up, which has become the talk of Westminster . The name gaffe by Mr Obama comes despite Mr Osborne boasting of his close links with the White House. After delivering a 90-minute presentation on global data-sharing plans to stop companies and individual’s hiding their profits in tax havens, Mr Osborne was left deflated when Mr Obama responded: ‘Thanks for that, Jeffrey.’ Handsome: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg could not hide his delight at being described as better looking than the PM by President Obama . But the two men could not be more . different. The Chancellor is the son of Sir Peter Osborne, 17th baronet . of Ballintaylor and Ballylemon. By contrast the father of singer-songwriter Jeffrey Osborne  was Clarence ""Legs"" Osborne, a trumpet player who played with Duke Ellington and Count Basie. He had a total of 12 children but died when Jeffrey was just 13. In an attempt to make amends, Mr Obama insisted that he did know Mr Osborne’s name really. ‘I’m sorry, man. I must have confused you with my favourite R&B singer,’ he said. Mr Osborne was not the only UK minister to be left put out by the President. When Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg arrived in Lough Erne, Mr Obama greeted him with a swipe at David Cameron, The Sun reported. ‘It's good to see the better looking half of the Coalition,’ he said. Today Mr Clegg could barely contain his delight at the compliment. He told his LBC 97.3 radio phone-in: 'These things happen. Any observer looking at the three of us would conclude that the people who looks the coolest is Obama.' The Lib Dem leader suggested Mr Cameron had not heard the jibe: 'It was quit a scrum as we were going towards a lunch.'","US President called the Chancellor 'Jeffrey' throughout a meeting at the G8 .

Warren Buffett, the 82-year-old who in 2012 was named the world's third wealthiest person, has a right-hand woman: a 28-year-old Harvard graduate who some say is being groomed to take over from Buffett when he retires. Tracy Britt began working for Buffett in 2009 as a financial assistant, and in four short years has become a trusted confidante of the billionaire and chairwoman of four of his companies, which bring in $4 billion combined annually. In 2007, in a letter to shareholders, Buffett announced that he was looking for a younger successor, or perhaps successors, to run his investment business. Speculation is mounting that Britt is that successor. Climbing the ladder: Many insiders are speculating that 28-year-old Tracy Britt will succeed 82-year-old Warren Buffett when he retires . Like other Buffett lieutenants, Britt was plucked from relative obscurity to rise through the ranks of Berkshire Hathaway, the company of which Buffett is chairman, CEO and primary shareholder. Britt grew up in Manhattan. Manhattan, Kansas that is, where her parents ran Britt's Garden Acres, growing fruit, vegetables and flowers. It wasn't Wall Street, but this is where Britt honed her business skills and developed her work ethic. 'Every minute that I had to work on the farm, I hated it,' she told Harvard Magazine in 2007, describing being stuck on the phone with distributors during summer holidays. 'But it actually shaped my dedication, my work ethic, and the way I follow through on the commitments I have made,' she said. Britt went to Harvard and then on to Harvard Business School, against the advice of many around her. 'I . had to drown out a great deal of unsolicited advice saying that I . absolutely must work before going to business school. I was told again . and again that I didn’t have sufficient experience, I wasn’t prepared, . and I was downright crazy to think that anyone would hire me in the . investing field straight from business school,' wrote Britt on Lean In. Mentor: Since he hired Britt in 2009, Warren Buffett has gradually added responsibilities to her role, and now she 'takes care of all kinds of things that come up' Buffett told college students in Omaha last month . 'During one of my classes, we were assigned to write a hypothetical personal reflection for our 10-year reunion. Mine... included this sentence: My goal is to work with a great investor, who even more importantly is a wonderful teacher and mentor. After reading my thoughts, one of my classmates – an individual who worked for large investment firms for several years before business school – told me that I was naïve and as a direct admit, I wasn’t aware of what the real world was like and that after I worked a few years, I’d realize just how unrealistic my personal reflection was,' she continued. But Britt received the 'wonderful teacher and mentor' of her dreams, and according to the Washington Post, has an office next door to her boss's. She also helps with financial research and accompanies Buffett to meetings. In March after Berkshire and Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital announced they would buy ketchup maker H.J. Heinz & Co. for $23 billion, Buffett sent Britt to Brazil. According to the Washington Post, he wanted Britt to be familiar with 3G's operations. Over the rainbow: Kansas native Tracy Britt grew up working her parents farm before going to Harvard where she was president of Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business and founded the not-for-profit Smart Women Securities . 'She's got this wealth of information about what's going on at the Berkshire portfolio companies,' Sam Taylor, chief executive of Oriental Trading Co. told the Washington Post. 'She knows exactly what's going on and where Warren's head is at.' Buffett first met Britt when she and a fellow graduate founded Smart Woman Securities, a not-for-profit organization focused on investment education for undergraduate women in 2006. She contacted Buffett asking if he would meet with her members at his company's headquarters in Omaha, and amazingly, he agreed. Buffett has written about his belief that there should be more women in business, and has said that he believes women are key to America's prosperity. Off to see the wizard: Kansan Tracy Britt first met Warren Buffett when she contacted him to ask if she could bring a group of young women interested in investments to speak with him - and her audacious request paid off . 'The moment I emerged from my . mother's womb... my possibilities dwarfed those of my siblings, for I . was a boy! And my brainy, personable, and good-looking siblings were . not,' he wrote in Fortune magazine. 'So . my floor became my sisters' ceiling - and nobody thought much about . ripping up that pattern until a few decades ago. Now, thank heavens, the . structural barriers for women are falling.' During her undergraduate studies Britt served as president of Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business and continued to work on her parents' farm during summers. As a junior, she interned at 85 Broads in New York City, a global women's networking organization. There, she was taken under the wing of a woman who worked in the hedge-fund industry. Farm girl: Britt's formative years were spent working her parents' farm outside of Manhattan, Kansas, where she dealt with distributors on the phone during the summers . 'She provided me with the guidance necessary to navigate the industry, . as well as the insight and confidence to be successful in finance,' said . Britt in Harvard Magazine. 'In an industry dominated by males, it is hard to break in if . you don’t know somebody or aren’t the type of person to get out there . and push in.' The organization was impressed with Britt, too: Janet Hanson, the founder of 85 Broads, remembers Ms. Britt from her internship. 'She had some sort of internal guiding system that was propelling her forward,' Ms. Hanson told the Washington Post. 'She was on rocket fuel... this was a gal who was going to get what she wanted.' Business-minded: Britt says she always knew she wanted to be involved in investments and got a taste for business dealing with distributors on her parents' farm . Britt's next . meeting with Buffett was when she was fresh out of business school in 2009, when she . brought a bushel of sweet corn and fresh tomatoes from her parents' farm . to her meeting with the businessman. Following this meeting, she was made Buffett's financial . assistant and has gone from strength to strength. 'I intend to hire a younger . man or woman with the potential to manage a very large portfolio, who we . hope will succeed me as Berkshire's chief investment officer when the . need for someone to do that arises,' Buffett wrote in a letter to . shareholders in 2007. 'As part of the selection process, we may in fact take on several candidates.' In May, Buffett announced at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting that he knows who his successor is, but he declined to name the person or persons. But one thing is for sure: Tracy Britt is destined for great things - especially with a mentor like Buffett. 'Fellow males, get on board. The . closer that America comes to fully employing the talents of all its . citizens, the greater its output of goods and services will be,' he . wrote in Fortune magazine. 'We've . seen what can be accomplished when we use 50 per cent of our human . capacity. If you visualize what 100 per cent can do, you'll join me as . an unbridled optimist about America's future.'","Tracy Britt, 28, is currently Warren Buffett's go-to girl with an office next to his, and chairwoman of four of his companies which bring in a combined $4 billion annually .

In 2008, he was jailed for two years after stabbing an Albuquerque business owner in the groin, KRQE said. The businessman had confronted Senn after neighbors told him a man was smashing his restaurant windows. And, in a case that has yet to go to court, Senn allegedly tried to punch a nurse at an Albuquerque hospital last year. The stepfather of the boy injured in the most recent attack said he had to be held back by bystanders after Senn launched his attack, the Huffington Post said. Assault: Clayton Senn's young victim, right, who has not been named, needed surgery for a skull fracture . Vicious: Clayton Senn allegedly swung a hammer at children in Smith's grocery store on Monday afternoon . The boy's skull was fractured in the attack, but he is expected to make a full recovery. Witnesses said Senn swung his hammer at other children but missed. The mother of the child had turned her back for only a moment in the cereal aisle when she heard a crack, as the hammer hit her son's head, detective Brian Crafton said. He told Koat7: '[Senn] wouldn't even make eye contact with me.' The 36-year-old, who is refusing to . talk to investigators, made headlines last year after being trapped in . mud in Rio Grande for three days, before students found him. At the time, he was known to police, . who believe he may have been trying to hide out when he became trapped . on the mud banks in January. Rescue: Clayton Senn lost both feet to frostbite after getting trapped in mud for three days in January last year . 'It is possible that he was trying to stay under the radar and stay off the main streets and avoid being arrested by police, but all he would tell officers is that he was trying to get away from the city and hike and he found himself stuck,' Albuquerque police spokesman Tasia Martinez told Koat7 at the time. He suffered frostbite during the ordeal and had to have his feet amputated. At his hearing on Tuesday, Senn's defense attorney declined to ask for a mental evaluation for his client.","Child needed skull surgery after attack in Albuquerque .

Claims: Fox New president Roger Ailes allegedly offered to pay a female TV producer an extra $100 a week if she had sex with him whenever he wanted, according to a new biography . Fox News chairman Roger Ailes once offered to pay a female TV producer $100 extra a week for sex, a damning new book alleges. While negotiating her salary at NBC in the 1980s, Randi Harrison claims Mr Ailes offered her the raise 'if you agree to have sex with me whenever I want.' Fox News has denied the allegations. In another anecdote, it was claimed that Mr Ailes was so dismissive of even his best talent that he referred to star host Bill O'Reilly as 'a book salesman with a TV show'. The claims have been made in a biography called The Loudest Voice In The Room by Gabriel Sherman, a contributing editor at New York magazine who has charted the 73-year-old's life from his childhood in Ohio to one of the most powerful positions in television. Under his leadership at Fox News Channel, the network now regularly pulls in more viewers than MSNBC and CNN combined, according to the New York Times which has been given prior access to the book. However, today, Mr Aisles hit back, telling The Hollywood Reporter that publishers Random House had failed to fact-check the contents of the book with him or Fox representatives. The news chief had refused to co-operate with the book and said: 'Bette Davis said, I think it was Bette Davis, ‘What other people think of me is none of my business.’ 'Attacking me and Fox News is nothing new – it’s a cottage industry. What’s new is that Random House refused to fact check the content with me or Fox News -- that tells you everything you need to know about this book and its agenda. Despite this, author Sherman retorted in a statement to Politico: 'During two and a half years of reporting, I made a dozen requests both in writing and in person to speak with Roger Ailes about every aspect of my book, The Loudest Voice In The Room. 'A team of two fact-checkers spent more than 2,000 hours vetting the manuscript before publication. Roger Ailes declined every request to discuss the reporting with me.' Fox News has also become the most profitable division of 21st Century Fox with annual earnings of around $1billion. Allegations: Mr Ailes (left) was so dismissive of even his best talent that he referred to star host Bill O'Reilly (right) as 'a book salesman with a TV show' As such, the book claims that Mr Ailes . was so eager to influence national politics that in the run-up to the . 2012 presidential election he told fellow Fox News executives that he . wanted to 'elect the next president'. Mr . Sherman says that, despite being unsatisfied with many of the . Republican candidates, Mr Ailes nevertheless sought to promote Mitt . Romney on his programs. The 560-page biography also points to a four-minute video criticising Barack Obama which incited outrage from the left. At the time, the network publicly stated that Mr Ailes was not involved in the broadcast, aired on Fox and Friends. But the book claims it was actually his 'brainchild'. According to the book's website, Mr Sherman 'chronicles the rise of Ailes, a sickly kid from an Ohio factory town who, through sheer willpower, the flair of a showman, fierce corporate politicking, and a profound understanding of the priorities of middle America, built the most influential television news empire of our time'. Controversial: The claims have been made in a new biography by New York magazine contributing editor Gabriel Sherman (left) called The Loudest Voice In The Room (right) which has been criticised by Fox staff . Some Fox employees are already dismissing . the book, with prime time host Sean Hannity describing Mr Sherman as a . 'phony journalist' on Twitter. Mr Ailes even chose a journalist to write his biography after Mr Sherman had started his. A Fox News spokeswoman said: 'While we have not read the book, the only reality here is that Gabe was not provided any direct access to Roger Ailes and the book was never fact-checked with Fox News.' The book is due out on January 21.","Roger Ailes 'made offer during talks with Randi Harrison at NBC in 1980s'

Though best known for her role as Sex And The City's vivacious, hyper-sexual Samantha, 56-year-old actress Kim Catrrall has revealed she has less in common with her most famous character than most people think. Speaking to Woman & Home magazine, Cattrall, 56, said she likes to 'step outside of what people's idea of me might be', adding that the men in her life see her as the person she is, rather than the characters she has played. In the interview the actress also discussed staying in shape, admitting that she has 'been on a diet since 1974', and that as she gets older she has to work harder to stay in shape. Kim Cattrall gives an open interview to Women & Home, explaining that she isn't really looking for a man, but the qualities she values in men are intelligence, humour and compatibility . The blonde star said: 'I . take care of myself, which includes dieting, exercising and minimising . stress. I joke that I've been on a diet since 1974, which is basically . true. 'I like to eat, and my body type is not naturally this thin, . especially at this age. So I do watch what I eat and drink but I'm not . obsessive - it's just a way of life. 'So I don't have dessert after every . meal - I just can't do it.

'And I'm always aware - from gaining and . losing weight for parts - that the time in the gym trying to lose extra weight is really hard work! I always have that in my mind.' Cattrall explained that she works out every other day and does cardiovascular exercise three or four times a week: 'I've had injuries in the past, so I also do ""physio yoga"" - a . combination of physio and yoga, so I'm constantly trying to rehabilitate . my body. 'The older I get, the less jarring I want my exercise to be, . and I find that a long walk is equally as helpful and satisfying as a . three-mile jog.' She said: 'And I'm always aware - from gaining and . losing weight for parts - that the time in the gym trying to lose extra . weight is really hard work! I always have that in my mind' Speaking about her relationships with men, Cattrall - who has been married three times and gone through two divorces and one annulment - said: and divorced three times, said: 'I . don't know if men are intimidated by me - you'll have to ask men! 'If my . accomplishments frighten someone, it's nothing to do with me - that's . to do with them. But the men who are in my life see me as a person - as a . woman - not as a character I've played. 'My male friends don't seem to . have any feelings of intimidation that I'm a 100-watt sex bomb  standing . next to them; they are able to distinguish between the Kim that is . their friend, and the characters I have played.' She added: 'I'm . not really looking for a man. But the qualities I value in a man are . intelligence, humour and compatibility - someone who has a temperament . that works with mine. I'm not volatile. My professional life has a lot of ups and downs but in my personal life, I'm pretty easy-going.' From left, Kristin Davis, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kim Cattrall in a still from the Sex And The City film in 2008 .

She said: 'My . mother and my two aunts were a huge influence. I come from a family of . four children, and three of them, including me, are women. 'Most of my . teachers and mentors have been women - it's what I was exposed to. My . father travelled a lot when I was young and my mother was always there - . so that was where I got my consistency and my values from, more than from my father's side. But . I was very close to my father. They say that children need their . mother, but I think that children need their mother and their father - . particularly later in life. When I started to go away to school and . jobs, that was when I needed my father. 'My . father, who died last year, had dementia. You don't ever get over that. When you lose someone you love, you never get over it. You celebrate . your memories of them. You never let it go.'

A spy plane equipped with a thermal imaging camera has flushed out hundreds of migrants living illegally in sheds and garages. Slough borough council spent £24,000 on flights to build up a  precise 3D map of every building in the Berkshire town. The plane criss-crossed streets, picking up heat signals from outbuildings which could signify they are being used as ‘sheds with beds’. An analysis of a small part of the two-hour flyover identified 210  suspicious dwellings. Example: This thermogram image shows the sort of data a thermal imaging camera will capture by flying over Slough . Illegal: Slough Council hopes to crackdown on rogue landlords turning sheds into illegal living accommodation, such as this conversion, pictured . The council now estimates that between 300 and 3,000 people are living illegally in the town. Anyone caught living illegally in . outbuildings faces eviction and their landlords hefty fines. Many . tenants pay as much as £100 a week to live in primitive conditions with . no water or heating. The council commissioned geographic imaging company Bluesky International to produce a thermal map of the town, which officers will use to pin-point warm areas in outbuildings. An analysis of a small part of the two-hour flyover identified 210 suspected illegal dwellings. Over the next few weeks officials . will issue penalty notices, similar to parking tickets, to landlords . with so-called beds in sheds, levying fines of £200 for each day that . tenants remain. In extreme cases the sheds will be demolished.

The plane criss-crossed streets, picking up heat signals from outbuildings . Ray Haslam, head of environmental . services and resilience for Slough Borough Council, said: 'Our primary . concern is making sure people aren’t living in unsafe conditions, with . little or no heating, or in places that do not comply with building or . fire safety regulations. 'Aerial photography is one of a range of tactics we’re using to crack down on this problem and we hope evidence of heat in outbuildings will help us build a true picture of how many sheds are being lived in and where they are. 'Some of these buildings are perfectly . habitable but others are not compliant and we will take action to amend . their use or have them removed.' Cllr James Swindlehurst . 'We will be able to cross-check and see whether they have valid Energy Performance Certificates which are required by law for places where people live. 'If they don’t, we will be speaking to landlords and offering some advice and guidance, and enforcing the law if we need to. 'One option is to repeatedly fine a landlord for not having an EPC. The fine is £200 a day, making it very expensive for people to continue using the outbuilding.' Cllr James Swindlehurst, deputy leader and commissioner for neighbourhoods and renewal, said: 'The people living in them generate waste, they use council services and they have a cost to the council that isn’t being paid for by taxation. Growing problem: Slough Council estimates there are up to 3,000 'beds in sheds' in the Berkshire town. It has been granted extra Government funding to help improve the condition of houses in multiple occupancy . Cut backs: Slough Council says people living in these illegal conversions use council services but do not contribute any council tax towards them . Some of the buildings uncovered may be allowed to remain a dwelling but others will be demolished . 'It causes pressure on parking and driveways and we get neighbourhood complaints about densely built gardens. 'Some of these buildings are perfectly habitable but others are not compliant and we will take action to amend their use or have them removed.' Slough Borough Council is one of a handful of local authorities who have been granted extra money from the Government to help improve conditions in houses of multi occupancy and reduce the number of sheds being used as accommodation without permission. The occupants of sheds in Slough are believed to be mostly single adults or childless couples with low incomes. Long-term, it is hoped, the thermal imaging data will also used to improve energy efficiency in homes across the borough. Last August it was announced that .

Council binmen failed to empty food recycling bins on an entire street for two whole months - because they couldn't find the road with their new GPS mapping system. In total, 28 sets of food recycling bins on Blackhorse Avenue in the village of Blackrod, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, were left to rot for weeks on end despite the road being listed in the  local A-Z and other local maps. Council refuse collectors claimed they found the street, built 50 years ago and situated just a few yards from the village's main road, 'difficult to . locate' after being issued with new specialist mapping technology. Angry: Mother-of-three Joanne Roberts, pictured outside her home on Blackhorse Avenue, Blackrod, Bolton, Greater Manchester, said refuse collectors failed to empty food recycling bins on her street for eight weeks despite numerous complaints to Bolton Council . The oversight continued for eight weeks despite locals repeatedly complaining refuse collectors had failed to show for their fortnightly collections four times - leaving overflowing bins crawling with maggots and swarming with flies. Binmen spotted by residents collecting from neighbouring streets on behalf of Bolton Council also refused to empty the food recycling bins on Blackhorse Avenue, saying: 'Sorry, it's not on my shift love.' Residents claim the stench from the bins became so bad they didn't want to walk outside their homes. Mother of three Joanne Roberts, 44, a doctors receptionist, said: 'We are a family of five so you can imagine how much food recycling we had accumulated. 'Everything goes in there. This has been a load of rubbish, quite literally. The flies were ridiculous and I had to leave the bin away from my house on the main road which I think I could have been fined for but I couldn't leave it near my house, the stench was disgusting. 'I don't know what a dead body smells like but I imagine it to be like my bin. I couldn't even walk past it.' Mrs Roberts added: 'When they didn't pick it up the first week I thought it was because they were still getting used to it so I didn't worry, but when the second fortnightly round didn't get collected we rang the council. We'd never had a problem before but they said it was because it was a new crew - I do not think that is a good enough excuse.' Ongoing: Binmen failed to show up for their fortnightly collections of food recycling bins on Blackhorse Avenue in Blackrod, Bolton, at least four times . The mother-of-three claimed she could see binmen collecting rubbish from nearby streets and it would have been impossible for them not to see Blackhorse Avenue. She said: 'I could see the binmen on their collections so how could they not see our street? It is literally just off the main road so there's no excuse whatsoever. They said that they didn't know where the street was but the streets just yards away were being emptied. 'Four out of the five of us in my family work and all pay our taxes, yet we are not getting the services we pay for. 'Plus, a lot of the people in the street are quite elderly and they were dragging their bins out each fortnight only for them not to be collected. It is not fair. It makes me really angry.' Mrs Roberts said that she phoned the council numerous times and had been told that there would be an assisted collection to pick up the bins in the next two days. But, she claims, they never showed up. She continued: 'They just didn't show up . and so I kept phoning. Every time I called they said it hadn't been . listed. Although it was a local number I am still forking out my own . money ringing. Joanne Roberts claims that binmen approached by Blackhorse Avenue residents as they collected rubbish from other streets refused to help . 'When I called back the second time they said my initial call hadn't been registered but that they'd do an assisted pick up yet that never happened either. I phoned numerous times over the period of eight weeks and phoned again every time it wasn't collected. 'When the binmen came to do an assisted collection for someone else an elderly lady came out and asked if they could take away hers but they told her, ""sorry, it's not on my shift love"". 'They are just jobsworths, the least they could do while they were there is to give us a hand. These bins were full and I expect that there are rats close by, I don't want to think about it. 'It got to the point where it was defeating the object because I just couldn't recycle any more because my bin was that full. It had to go in the grey bin which by rights I could have been fined for as it's breaking the law. 'After that we got the manager of recycling out to do a home visit and all the green bins were lined up. The smell was sheer disgusting, it was vile. In fact the smell is still there and I suggested that they pay for the bins to be professionally cleaned, I'm even too disgusted to put my rubbish back in after the amount of maggots and flies and sludge in there.' Another neighbour said the excuse that binmen couldn't find the street - which was built in 1963 - was ridiculous. Resident David Brandwood,59, said: 'Our green bin hadn't been emptied for about eight weeks - there was rotting food and garden waste in there for ages. 'It was really smelly and horrible. I rang the council three times but nothing happened. I don't buy the idea that they couldn't find us - this street has been here since 1963.' Bolton Council said it has now emptied the bins. A spokesman added: 'Recently introduced changes to the collection service meant that new crews were still learning new collection rounds. Unfortunately Blackhorse Avenue was missed by the crew as it was difficult to locate from their maps. 'We would like to apologise to residents for any inconvenience. The issue has been highlighted to the new crews to ensure it is not missed on future collections.'","Blackhorse Avenue in the village of Blackrod, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, was built in 1963 and is featured in local A-Z maps .

For one group of willing adventurers, their expedition instead involved sailing through the rough seas of the North Pacific Ocean amid tons of debris from the Japanese Tsunami. Marcus Eriksen and his 11 companions have spent the last month documenting the rubbish making its way towards North America to determine its effects on marine life and help track its transit since the disaster. Scroll down for video . Rubbish cruise: Marcus Eriksen and other crew members sail from Japan to Hawaii to collect and analyse debris from the Japanese tsunami . One for the collection: Members of the expedition with some of the debris they hauled in from the Pacific Ocean using fishing nets . Around 4.8million tonnes - including parts of houses, factories, cars and ships - were pulled into the ocean when the earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck Japan in March last year. While heavy items sank, at least 1.5million tonnes of lighter material such as buoys, oil drums and furniture were carried off by tides and the wind on a 4,500-mile journey to North America. Mr Eriksen, whose non-profit group the 5 Gyres Institute has been working to reduce plastics polluting the oceans, and his team sailed 4,000 miles across the Pacific before making it into Hawaii this week. 'While we were doing this, we were very much aware of the tragedy,' Eriksen told ABCNews. 'We are in the middle of nowhere and we are seeing one piece of trash every three and a half minutes.' All sorts at sea: The crew's biggest find was this fishing boat, which was originally about 16ft long before it broke in half . What a mess: A diver gets to grips with some of the North Pacific garbage. The team have been trying to analyse the effects of tsunami pollution on marine life . Doing his head in: Some of the trash found during the month-long 'cruise' across the north Pacific . Their biggest find was half a fishing boat, which Eriksen believes was originally about 16 feet long. Around 50 or 60 fish were found living inside. 'What's now a wreck of a boat has become a floating reef system for this crowd,' Eriksen wrote in his blog chronicling the journey. Mr Eriksen, who has spent 12 years studying plastic trash in the world's oceans, says the Pacific is 'one giant garbage patch'. He will be relaying his data back to a marine research institute, which will analyse the garbage as part of its mapping of the tsunami debris. Last month, the biggest item to wash up on U.S. shores - a 70ft-long Japanese dock - was found on a beach in Oregon. Trash talk: The dock washed up on Agate Beach in Oregon last month after floating for nearly 15 months across the Pacific Ocean from Japan . Devastation: The earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck Japan in March last year washed nearly five million tonnes of debris, including boats, cars and part of houses and factories into the Pacific . On fast tides: The latest computer models predict that thousands of tonnes of debris, shown here in a graphic interpretation of a NASA satellite image, from the Japanese tsunami will hit North American shores far sooner than expected . The State Department of Parks and . Recreation said the Japanese consulate in Portland, Oregon, traced the . seven-feet-tall concrete and steel floating dock washed up on the beach . to a manufacturer in Japan. The dock carried a metal placard . naming the manufacturer as Zeniya Ocean Service Engineering Ltd, which . builds docks and floating marine structures and is dated June 2008. The latest computer models estimate . that thousands of tonnes of the debris, which now stretches 4,000 . nautical miles across the north Pacific, will start washing up this . October and continue to do so into late 2013. Projections made earlier this year by the . International Pacific Research Centre (IPRC), in Honolulu, Hawaii, . suggested most of the detritus would begin arriving between March 2013 . and March 2014. But predictions from the Japanese . government and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . (NOAA) has now pushed that date forward to October this year, according . to a report in The Guardian. Indeed, many lighter objects began reaching land as early as last November. U.S. coastal states, already suffering from severe budget cuts in the wake of the financial crisis, are having their finances strained further by the need to fund the clean-up of their beaches, which could cost up to $200million. Bizarre find: This Harley-Davidson was found on a remote beach on the west coast of British Columbia last week after being swept away by the tsunami last year . Poignant: Items from the disaster have also been recovered in Alaska, like this sandal . Debris: Toothbrushes are among thousands of items making their way to shore after crossing the Pacific . Earlier . this year, a Japanese teenager who lost his home in last year's . devastating tsunami spoke of his delight after his football washed up on . a remote Alaskan beach 3,500 miles from Japan. Misaki . Murakami, 16, came forward to reveal that he was the owner of the ball . discovered by American radar technician David Baxter on Middleton . Island. Mr Baxter, who also . found a volleyball while out beachcombing, now plans to travel with his . wife Yumi across the Pacific to return the ball. And in May, the Japanese owner of a . Harley-Davidson motorcycle said its discovery on a remote beach on the . West Coast of British Columbia last week was a miracle. The . owner, Ikuo Yokoyama, a 29-year-old resident of the town of Yamamoto, . in Miyagi Prefecture, was tracked down by a Harley-Davidson . representative in Japan who saw the story, first reported by CBC News, . the broadcaster reported today.
