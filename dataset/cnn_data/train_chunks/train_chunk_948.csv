"By . Daily Mail Reporters . A married gym teacher accused of raping her 16-year-old student sent lovesick text messages about him to a second teen she also allegedly assaulted. Joy Morsi's alleged affair with the first underage student was exposed this week when she flipped out over his decision to take a classmate to the prom. 'I can’t believe [name deleted] is going to the prom with [name deleted],' the 39-year-old texted to the second boy, a source told New York Post. The source said the pair exchanged texts which led to an alleged weekend rendezvous in a basement office at Grover Cleveland HS in Queens, New York. In the texts, Morsi and the boy arranged to meet on Saturday, two days before the teacher was arrested for the alleged sex with the first student. Charged: Joy Morsi, center, a 39-year-old teacher at Grover Cleveland High School in Queens, New York, was taken into custody on Wednesday morning on the latest charge just hours after she had pleaded not guilty to raping a student when he was 16 . Students told the Post the boy's prom date told her mother about the illicit affair, who then reported Morsi to authorities. Morsi was taken into custody on Wednesday morning on the latest charge . just hours after she had pleaded not guilty to raping a student when he . was 16. 'Two weeks . after the alleged relationship with that student ended, she enticed a . student and engaged in sexual activity with this 16-year-old again on . school property just over this past weekend,' prosecutor Melissa . Kelly said. Prosecutors cited text messages as evidence of the sexual encounter. Morsi was charged with two-counts of third-degree criminal sexual act and one-count of endangering the welfare of a child. She was ordered held on an additional $25,000 bail and must return to court on June 23, reports ABC7. 'These are serious accusations in which a school teacher - who should serve as a role model to students - is instead accused of using her position to gain access to children for her own gratification,' Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said. Humiliating: Joy Morsi's husband, Hany Morsi (pictured) is a science teacher at the same school as his wife, Grover Cleveland High School in Queens, New York . Morsi cannot be . fired or stripped of her pay without due process, officials said. On Tuesday, Morsi had been charged with . third-degree rape and third-degree criminal sex act after being accused . of raping a 16-year-old student wrestler. Morsi is alleged to have sent the wrestler raunchy selfies and emails. Their affair was only exposed after she flew into a jealous rage because he was taking another girl to prom. The Long Island mother, whose husband Hany Morsi, also teaches at the school, was first arrested on Monday. The illegal relationship with the wrestler began last June when Morsi offered to help the student lose weight, prosecutors said in court. On June 5, Morsi allegedly lured the unidentified student into a 'secluded closet' where she exposed herself to him. Scene: Joy Morsi, 39, a gym teacher at Grover Cleveland High School in Ridgewood, Queens (pictured) is accused of raping two underage students . She also allegedly sent the student emails asking if he was a virgin, along with saucy text messages. The . court heard the pair had sex all over the school from June to July last . year, and continued to meet for sex outside of school. In court on Tuesday, Morsi pleaded not guilty to numerous counts of third-degree rape, a criminal sexual act in the third degree and one count of endangering the welfare of a child. The stone-faced teacher did not comment after being ordered held on $25,000 bail. As the student turned 17 during the nearly year-long dalliance, subsequent alleged encounters are considered legal. Morsi, described by some students as 'a hard-working teacher', did not comment as she left court. City Department of Education officials said Morsi was 'immediately removed' from the classroom when she was reported. Charged: Joy Morsi (seated) has been suspended with full pay from her tenured teaching position at Grover Cleveland High School in Queens, New York. Her husband Hany Morsi (pictured) is a science teacher at the same school . 'We find these claims disturbing and reprehensible and she will remain reassigned - far from any student and the school - pending a criminal investigation,' deputy press secretary Marcus Liem said. 'We will work closely with the school to ensure they are given any needed support.' Morsi, who has four children, had nothing to say as she left court on Tuesday, but attorney, Virginia Lopreto, signaled she would fight the case. 'My client’s ties to the community have been verified,' Lopreto said. 'Her husband is here. She has a family and children. She’s very likely to see this through.' Morsi started working as a gym teacher in 1999, has a clean discipline record and earns $79,531 a year, according to records. Meanwhile students at the school said rumors had long circulated about the alleged affair. 'We had a feeling that something was going on,' ninth-grader Josie Gonzalez told New York Daily News. 'They would always be together around the school.' If convicted, Morsi faces eight years in prison.","Joy Morsi, 39, is a tenured gym teacher at Grover Cleveland High School in Queens, New York .

"By . Ryan Lipman . A five-year-old girl has received a confidential multi-million dollar payout from pharmaceutical manufacturer CSL Ltd and the state of Western Australia after becoming severely disabled from a flu vaccination. Saba Button got the vaccination under a government-promoted scheme in April 2010 when a GP injected a 0.25ml dose of CSL 2010 Fluvax into her left arm. As a consequence of the vaccination, she suffered hypoxic brain injury and severe disabilities. Mick and Kirsten Button, pictured with daughter Saba, have reached a multimillion dollar settlement a pharmaceutical manufacturer and the state of Western Australia . Her life expectancy has been significant shortened and she will require constant care for the rest of her life. Days after she was vaccinated and dozens of other adverse reactions in children were reported, the state government suspended its seasonal flu vaccination program. The Buttons said the settlement - which media reports suggest was in the order of several million dollars - was a huge relief. 'No one wants to really go through court ... to settle it through mediation is a great relief for us,' father Mick Button told reporters. He said Saba inspires him every day, and the settlement would provide the family with financial security to meet her needs. 'You can't buy your health but it is a good outcome,' mother Kirsten said. 'Amazingly strong': The Buttons are focusing their attention on their daughter's treatment and are happy to put the settlement behind them . Saba was a toddler when she received a flu shot, which left her with severe disabilities requiring constant life-long care . CSL denied any liability and claiming that the State of Western Australia and the state's health minister were responsible for any compensation due. CSL also cross-claimed against the state and the minister for a contribution in the event its defence were to fail. The state and the minister filed a defence to the cross claim denying any liability in the matter. The claim and cross claim were privately mediated, resulting in all of the parties reaching a settlement. On Friday, Federal Court of Australia Justice Michael Barker approved the agreement. Fluvax is now banned in children aged under five years and hundreds of other adverse reactions were experienced by children days after Saba was vaccinated .","A WA family has reached a settlement in vaccination case .

"By . Julian Robinson . The wife of the man who led Britain into the First World War dismissed Winston Churchill as a ‘dangerous maniac’ in her hard-hitting diaries, a new book has revealed. Margot Asquith was the wife of Herbert Henry Asquith, the Liberal Prime Minister who was ousted from Downing Street during the Great War. From her vantage point she created a ‘compelling’ record of her husband’s fall from grace – and revealed her disdain for a number of leading figures of the day. Herbert Asquith, pictured left, was ousted from Downing Street during the First World War. His wife Margot, right, his fall from grace in her diaries and did not hold back in her views of some of leading political figures . Winston Churchill, pictured centre with General De Gaulle in Paris in 1944, came in for particular criticism in Margot Asquith's 1915 diary entries . At one point, writing in 1915, she says Churchill’s ‘vanity is septic. He would die of blood poisoning if it were not for a great deal of red blood which circulates freely through his heart and stomach.’ She goes on to describe him as a ‘dangerous maniac, so poor in character and judgment, so insolent and childish, I hardly even think him a danger’, the Observer reports. Her views are revealed in ‘Margot Asquith’s Great War Diary’ by Michael and Eleanor Brock, released later this month. Lord Kitchener, Secretary of State for War, also came in for criticism from Margot Asquith, the wife of Herbert Asquith . David Lloyd George, British Prime Minister 1922, was another leading politician to come in for withering scorn in Margot Asquith's diaries . And it is not just Second World War great Winston Churchill who incurs her wrath in the diaries, which stretch from 1914 to 1916. The man who took over at Downing Street during the Great War, David Lloyd George, comes in for particular criticism when she writes: ‘All he undertakes drops in chaos and confusion on a floor littered with covered tracks.’ Margot Asquith's Great War Diary 1914 - 1916: The View from Downing Street, is available later this month . Lady Asquith, who once described herself as ‘a sort of political clairvoyant’ also turns her attentions on the secretary of state for war, Lord Kitchener who she slammed as ‘slow and cumbersome in mind’ and 'a man brutal by nature and by pose'. The diaries chart some of the political battles that lay behind the warfare on the Western Front and charts her own views on the conflict. 'This is the 84th day of the war' she wrote in October 1914, 'and speaking for myself I have never felt the same person since. I don't mean to say I have improved! On the contrary...'. But she reserved praise for her husband, who was replaced as Prime Minister during the war following a series of military and political crises. She lovingly describes him as 'by far the ablest, wisest, calmest and cleverest man in England'. Margot Asquith was born Alice Margaret Tennant in Peeblesshire, Tweeddale in 1864 and would go on to become a well known socialite, author and wit. She was married to Herbert Henry Asquith from 1894 until he died in 1928. She bore five children, only two of whom survived infancy, Elizabeth, who married Antoine Bibesco of Romania in 1919 and became a writer and Anthony, who became a leading film director. Margot Asquith's Great War Diary 1914 - 1916, by Michael and Eleanor Brock, is available from June 26, published by Oxford University Press.","Margot Asquith's diaries covered 1914 to 1916 during First World War .

"By . Sally Lee . The chairman of Defence Abuse Response Taskforce, Len Roberts-Smith, said he thought the issue of abuse was bigger than it has been publicly acknowledged . Four former female cadets from the Australian Defence Force Academy have revealed fresh allegations of rape and sexual assault by their male superiors. ABC's Four Corners aired its investigation on Monday night, on which female cadets recounted the horrors the endured while at the academy in the 1990s. The program also claimed that nothing was done about many of the allegations, with complaints from cadets often locked away in a filing cabinet known as the 'chamber of horrors', never to be seen again. Some alleged that the perpetrators are currently serving military officers, or are still working for the department. One former cadet, who went by the fake name 'Susan', said a superior came into her bedroom during the 1990s and proceeded to indecently assault her. 'He was a third year. He was much bigger than me. I just froze and pretended to be dead really, and wished I was,' she said. Scroll down for video . ABC's Four Corners aired their investigation on Monday night, where these cadets recounted their horror stories whilst at the academy from the 1990s . Her complaint was one of many that was placed in the filing cabinet known internally as the 'chamber of horrors'. She said the cabinet was full of envelopes - each of them containing a complaint lodged by ADFA cadets alleging sexual harassment or assault. Susan said she witnessed the process herself, and said that was the last she heard of the incident, believing it was never properly dealt with or investigated. A still-serving officer, who went by the made-up name 'Jane' and was played by an actress on the program to protect her identity, said she was raped as a cadet during the 1990s. Even after the assault, Jane decided to stay with the army - but she said she had to watch her attacker move up the ranks, unpunished for his crime. The report also revealed that many complaints by cadets were unresolved and put away in a filing cabinet dubbed the 'chamber of horrors' The cabinet was full of envelopes, each of them containing a complaint lodged by cadets at the ADFA alleging sexual harassment or assault. 'To walk around the corner and literally bump into him again was awful. I didn't know how to react. I felt frightened, I felt powerless ... to still have him standing there, laughing and joking with his mates and knowing he's still part of the organisation that I'm in,' she said. Following a notorious 2011 incident, where two ADFA cadets used Skype to secretly film a female colleague having sex, an external review of sexual and other abuse in the Department of Defence was announced by then-Defence Minister Stephen Smith. The Defence Abuse Response Taskforce (DART) which has since assessed more than 2,400 complaints of abuse, paid $28 million in compensation and referred 63 matters to police. But Len Roberts-Smith, the chairman of DART, told the program that he believed the problem of abuse within the military is bigger than it has been publicly acknowledged.","The investigation, which aired on the ABC's Four Corners, uncovered allegations which took place from the 1990s .

"By . Sally Lee . A transgender teenager who wore a dress to her Melbourne high school for the first time after 16 years as a boy says she finally feels like she exists after she 'felt like dying'. Mia Pike, 17, was raised as a boy named Brendan but realised just over a year ago she was born the wrong gender. Her mother was so concerned by the troubled teen's mental state before the transition she revealed: 'I don't think Brendan would have made it to year 12'. She wore a dress to Carrum Downs Secondary College, south-east of Melbourne, for the first time on Monday and officially changed her name at the school last week. Mia Pike, 17, was raised as a boy named Brendan but realised just over a year ago she was born the wrong gender . 'I think it's more like I wasn't living before I started being myself,' Mia told MailOnline. 'I feel like I actually exist now and I'm definitely a lot happier.' But the decision to identify as a girl six months ago wasn't easy and Mia admits she 'felt like dying' after she realised she was transgender. '(I) just felt like I couldn't do it because no one would accept me,' Mia said. 'I was unhappy with myself when I realised. I thought I wouldn't ever be able to be myself. 'It was okay before I knew. But I felt depressed after that. 'The hard bit was telling everyone then having to explain it all.' Mia wore a dress to Carrum Downs Secondary College, south east of Melbourne, for the first time on Monday and officially changed her name last week . Her mother, Donna Pike, was unaware of the pain Mia was going through at the time and spent six months fearing for her child's life. Ms Pike told The Project she wasn't sure if Mia would have coped had it not been for the school's support of her decision. 'I don't think Brendan would have made it to year 12. I don't think Brendan would have become Mia and there's a very big chance Brendan wouldn't be here,' Ms Pike told the program. Thoughts of suicide are not uncommon amongst transgender Australians - recent figures from the National LGBTI Health Alliance show 20 percent have considered suicide and 50 percent have attempted to take their life at least once. Mia spent 16 years as Brendan and said the decision to identify as a girl wasn't easy. She admits she 'felt like dying' after realising she was transgender . The 17-year-old said she doesn't have any plans to go back to her life as Brendan and she hopes other teenagers can find inspiration in her story . Her school, Carrum Downs Secondary College, has implemented a number of practices to make Mia's transition easier including education for students and staff, according to principal Sherrallin Smith. 'We also built a group of students around her who support her in the school yard,' Ms Smith told The Project. The 17-year-old said she 'didn't know about transgender people' until she attended Peninsula Pride meeting in May last year - a support group run by Queer Straight Alliance. Since then, her support network has only grown. Her sister Meliza, 14, came out as a lesbian around the same time Mia revealed was actually a girl. 'Of course I'm so proud of my sister,' Meliza said.

"By . Sara Malm . The elderly alpha male of the only brown bear colony in the Pyrenees is facing castration after officials discover he has been breeding with his own offspring for the past two decades. Pyros the bear's 'sexual domination' of the colony of 30-odd bears living near Val d'Aran, Spain, has seen him end up the father, grandfather and great-grandfather to every cub born in the colony for the past 20 years. Spanish officials are now facing the difficult decision of either castrating or capturing 26-year-old Pyros in order to stop the dangerous level of inbreeding which is risking the species' survival in the European mountain range. Still going strong: Pyros the alpha is risking castration after officials discover he has fathered all the cubs born in the Pyrenean brown bear colony in the past 20 years (file photo) The bear’s sexual dominance came to light after Spanish officials discovered that Pyros was both father and grandfather to a recent cub. At 26, Pyros’ ‘vigour’ should have slowed down in his late teens, however, Pyros remains as active as ever, resulting in dangerous levels of inbreeding in the colony. The colony of 30-odd bears include four other males, but only one is not an offspring of Pyros’ and none of them have fathered any cubs, officials found. As a result, Spanish officials say they have to choose between castrating Pyros and segregating him from the group in order to secure the species’ survival in the Pyrenees. Inbreeding: Pyros' sexual appetite and dominance in the group has to be stopped as the limited gene pool is risking the survival of the bear population of the Pyrenees . ‘If he keeps up this sexual vigour and dominant attitude for a few more years, the other males in the mountains have no chance of mating with any of the females,’ Val d’Aran environmental councillor José Enrique Arró, told La Vanguardia, according to The Guardian. If Pyros is not castrated he would have to be moved, however, due to his old age, sedating and moving him to a new area – wild or in captivity – could cause fatal stress and other risks to his health. A representative from the Catalan regional government told the paper that even if Pyros is sterilised and left with the colony, his dominant sexual behaviour could continue, making it difficult for the other males to mate with the females of the group. Mr Arró said he hopes that the introduction of a new bear to the colony could help, but it is also possible that Pyros’ family jewels can be saved if his biological clock finally begins to tick and he starts to act his age. Local authorities have long fought to save the brown bear population of the Pyrenees by transferring brown bears over from Slovenia. The last indigenous female brown bear in the mountain range, which forms the natural border between France and Spain, was shot by a hunter in 2004.","Pyros the alpha bear may have to be castrated to save the species .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Port Augusta police had to use their coaxing skills to try and entice a goat called Sandra down from the roof of a house on Saturday afternoon. Known for their climbing skills, Sandra was right at home as she frolicked about on the roof of the single storey home in Crichton Drive in Port Augusta, South Australia. The adventurous animal also climbed onto the flat roof of an adjoining covered area without any concern. Stuck: Police attended a home in Port Augusta, South Australia to get Sandra the goat off the roof . Police had to get creative with their coaxing methods as the Sandra refused to come down . 'On the early hours of Saturday afternoon at about 1.10pm, police were called by neighbours to the house following reports of a goat on a roof,' Inspector Ian Humby told MailOnline. Insp Humby said because the backyard was raised, the goat was able to jump onto the roof. 'It was feasible that she jumped from the backyard onto the roof,' he said. As residents of the property were not home at the time police were called, Insp Humby said it was hard to determine how long Sandra had been on the roof for, but he does not believe it was a long time. With the goat refusing to budge, the police tried using two different types of grass to entice her back down, as reported on the South Australia Police News Facebook page. Inspt Humby said the officers used hay to bring Sandra down temporarily before she got back onto the roof. The police tried using two types of grass to encourage Sandra to come down off the roof to no avail . Getting creative, the police used an old clothes line as a lasso and a makeshift ramp to bring down the adventurous animal . At this point the people living in the home returned and explained to officers they were only looking after the goat for a few days. They also said it was not the first time Sandra had got onto the roof. 'I guess its true when they say goats like heights,' Insp Humby said. But with the animal back on the roof and refusing to come down, the police improvised by using a makeshift ramp and a lasso made from and old clothes line to bring Sandra back down. Sandra suffered no injuries and was safely returned to her owner's yard. Despite her excellent climbing skills, Sandra was brought back down off the roof .

Chinese officials threatened to sabotage an important diplomatic trip to Britain by the Communist country's prime minister unless he could meet the Queen, it has been reported. Chinese officials allegedly told their British counterparts that Li Keqiang - a key player in China's economy - would pull out of next week's visit if a meeting with the monarch was not scheduled. But if China did take a hard line on the visit, it was successful. Mr Li is set to meet the Queen and David Cameron during the three-day trip. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman refused to comment on the matter. Number 10 also declined to comment on the reports. However, a government source noted that it is not unprecedented for non-heads of state to meet the Queen, such as when German chancellor Angela Merkel did so in February. A source, speaking to The Times, said: 'The Chinese are hard negotiators.' They added that Chinese officials had also pressed British diplomats to find out minutiae of the meetings, such as what style of dress Samantha Cameron will wear when Mr Li and his wife meet the Camerons. Prime . Minister David Cameron is forced to walk a tightrope when it comes to . negotiating with the People's Republic, balancing the trade benefits of friendly . relations with a growing economic superpower with also keeping them at . arm's length because of the nation's reported human rights abuses. In January Xinhua, China's state press agency, reported that China-UK bilateral trade reached a record high in 2013, surpassing £41billion. Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming said: 'UK's export to China increased by 13.8 percent, much higher than China's other EU trade partners. 'Our relations have come to a fresh start. We face great opportunities that have never been seen before,' said Liu, disclosing that Chinese investment in the UK over the past two years reached nearly £8billion, exceeding the total of the previous three decades. British Prime Minister David Cameron shakes hands with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing in December 2013. There is a vast and still-growing amount of trade between China and the UK . Meanwhile Amnesty International claims human rights violations are widespread in China. An estimated 500,000 people are currently being detained without charge or trial. The human rights organisation added that harassment, surveillance, house arrest, and imprisonment of human rights defenders are on the rise, while censorship has grown. Although Chinese authorities treat official execution statistics as a state secret, Amnesty International estimates thousands are killed every year - more than the rest of the world combined. The Queen visited China in 1986. Here she is seen talking to former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in Beijing . Earlier this month there was a string of detentions of artists, lawyers, scholars and journalists ahead of the Tiananmen Square Massacre anniversary amid intense government efforts to deter coverage by foreign media of its remembrance. China allows no public discussion of the events of June 3-4, 1989, when soldiers backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers fought their way into the heart of Beijing, killing hundreds of unarmed pro-democracy protesters and onlookers. The government has never issued a complete, formal accounting of the crackdown or the number of casualties.","Li Keqiang's visit in jeopardy unless meeting was arranged, it was reported .

"By . Wills Robinson . Francis Matthews, the voice of the iconic 1960s sci-fi hero Captain Scarlet, has died at the age of 86 following a short illness. Anderson Entertainment, the company behind the extra-terrestrial puppet show, said it was 'sad' to announce the passing of the actor, who brought the Mysteron-battling character to life in Gerry Anderson’s production between 1967 and 1968. Matthews’ voice for the Spectrum agent was based on the Transatlantic accent of Hollywood star Cary Grant, and became well known to generations of children thanks to countless re-runs over the years. Scroll down for video . Icon of children's television: Franics Matthews, (left), the voice of Mysteron-battling Captain Scarlet (right) in the 1960s, has died at the age of 86 following a short illness . Matthews also became known for playing Francis Durbridge’s amateur detective, Paul Temple, in the BBC TV drama series and appeared in several Hammer Horror films. In a statement on www.gerryanderson.co.uk, the company said: 'We are very sorry to report that Francis Matthews, best known to Gerry Anderson fans as the voice of the indestructible puppet hero Captain Scarlet, has died aged 86. 'Having previously had a policy of using American accents in their shows to aid sales to America, Gerry and Sylvia relaxed their casting requirements for Captain Scarlet as it was felt that British accents were now more acceptable Stateside than had previously been the case. Spectrum: Captain Scarlet, Captain Brown and Captain Blue were part of a team that tried to thwart a martian invasion of Earth . 'After hearing Matthews’ uncanny impression of Cary Grant, a voice that would have been familiar to all on both sides of the Atlantic, he was cast in 1966.' Matthews’s wife, the actress Angela Browne, died in 2001, Anderson Entertainment said. He is survived by his sons Damien, Paul and Dominic. He also appeared alongside Morecambe and Wise in the films The Intelligence Men (1965) and That Riviera Touch (1966), leading to a close friendship with Eric Morecambe. He also appeared throughout the 1960s and 1970s in a variety of TV comedy roles, including Eric & Ernie's Christmas Show, 1977. Extra-terrestrial: Captain Scarlet took on the martians from Mars, known as the Mysterons alongside Lieutenant Green and Captain Blue . Partners: Captain Scarlet, who was cloned by the Mysterons, sits alongside Captain Blue and Captain Black. After the duplication process, Scarlet became indestructible . Planning: The Spectrum team sit in a conference surrounding Colonel White . Career: Matthews (right) also starred in a number of horror films, including The Revenge of Frankenstein in 1948 . Team: Each of the members of Spectrum are named after their colours - Captain Blue (left) and Captain Scarlet . The show was set in the year 2068, and began with an attack on a city in Mars by the human race. The red planet was, at the time, inhabited by aliens known as the Mysterons, who had set up a colony there 3,500 years ago. In response, the martians declared a 'war or nerves' on Earth, targeting world leaders and military installations in a bid to take over the planet. They controlled the battle from space and used clones of humans they had killed to carry out terrorist attacks and threaten the globe's population. Their first act of revenge however was to execute the World President. The initial part of their plan was to kill Captain Scarlet, Spectrum's foremost weapon. He is involved in a car accident, orchestrated by the Mysterons, and is quickly replaced in the organisation by an evil clone. However, the duplicate is shot dead by one of Scarlet's comrades, Captain Blue, and comes back to life free from alien control and virtually indestructible. The trait, known as retro-metabolism, means when he was killed or injured, he was restored almost immediately to full health. As a result, he went on painstaking suicide missions in the face of the enemy, knowing he would return without any physical damage. Throughout the 1960s series, the martians carried on making terrorist threats and tried to follow through with their ability to create hoards of obedient clones. Together with partners, Captain Blue, Lieutenant Green and The Angels, the immortal Captain Scarlet continued to thwart the extra-terrestrial threats. He became Spectrum's most lethal agent and the key figure in defending the world, developing an ability to sense if a Mysteron was nearby. The martians stepped up their effort by building another complex on the Moon, but Spectrum countered it by developing state-of-the-art weapons known as the Mysteron Gun and Mysteron Detector. The show was first broadcast on ATV Midlands in September 1967 and lasted until May 1968. Since then, the programme has been transmitted in more than 40 other countries, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. The BBC then purchased the programme in 1993 and the episodes have since been re-run a number of times, making Francis Matthews and the puppet an integral part of children's television.","Francis Matthews brought the martian-battling sci-fi hero to life in 1967 .

"By . Ian Gallagher In Rio De Janeiro . Alarm: The BBC has issued a security warning after a TV worker was attacked by a gang outside the hotel where Gary Lineker (pictured) is staying . The BBC has issued an urgent security warning to its World Cup staff in Rio de Janeiro after four youths tried to mug a TV worker outside the hotel where Gary Lineker is staying. The victim, described as a ‘consultant’, was surrounded by the gang three minutes after leaving the ITV studios on Copacabana Beach, but bravely fought them off after a scuffle. It happened as he passed the gates of Girl From Ipanema park, named after the famous song, at 7pm last Sunday. Then, on the opening night of the tournament on Thursday, the ITV studios were pelted with rocks during a protest. Two demonstrators arrested were reportedly carrying explosive devices. The incidents have prompted the BBC and ITV to take extra measures to ensure safety of staff. Both broadcasters are understood to have hired private security firms. Lineker posted a photograph on Twitter of riot police lined up outside the BBC studios, writing: ‘Best defence on show this evening, right outside.’ Lineker, who is anchoring the Corporation’s coverage in Brazil, broadcasts from the studio above ITV’s and, along with the rest of his team, was told about the mugging when he arrived in Rio the day after it happened. Scroll down for video... Strong defence: Lineker posted this picture of police surrounding the ITV studios on Saturday . The BBC is concerned because the . attack happened just yards from the four-star Arpoador Inn, where the . pundit and former England captain is staying along with the rest of his . broadcast team. In an email . to staff, the BBC said: ‘Youths attempted to steal the bag of  a . consultant working for ITV this evening. He was surrounded by four young . males who attempted to grab his bag from his back. ‘They were unsuccessful and quickly fled the scene.’ Accompanying the email was a map ‘showing the Arpoador’s location in relation to the park’. The email warns: ‘After dark, staff should avoid walking back to the hotel alone, especially if carrying kit.X . ‘As mentioned previously, don’t wear or carry anything on your person that isn’t essential to your work/tasks for the day. Pundits (from left to right): Lee Dixon, Fabio Cannavaro, Patrick Vieira and Adrian Chiles in the ITV studio - which was pelted by rocks during the opening night of the tournament . Action: Protesters gathered outside the ITV studio on Thurday with banners that read 'Fifa go home' While World Cup players have been  trying to acclimatise to the sweltering temperatures in Brazil, a group of  Miss Belgium contestants found a  novel way to deal with the heat in  their own country – by playing a  match in their bras. The French speakers took on those who  speak Flemish in a match  in the town  of Waregem. 'Walking through the park at any time . should be avoided if carrying kit/valuables, and staff should consider . it off-limits after dark.’ The park leads to Copacabana beach and is  popular with tourists, who are regularly targeted by criminals. It is close to the spot where the real Girl From Ipanema was spotted by Brazilian songwriter Antonio Carlos Jobim and poet Vinicius de Moraes as they sat outside the Veloso cafe in 1962. The song they wrote about the girl, 19-year-old Heloisa Eneida Menezes Paes Pinto, became a worldwide hit. With protests by Brazilians angered by the cost of hosting the World Cup continuing across the country, security is becoming a major issue. The government is spending £509  million on policing. As well as 150,000 troops and police officers on duty, more than 2,000 private security companies are protecting officials, VIPs and media organisations.","Victim attacked outside Rio de Janeiro hotel where Gary Lineker is staying .

"By . Tara Brady . A musician who was hypnotised sang as a tumour was removed from her throat so surgeons could make sure they didn't damage her vocal cords. Alama Kante, a married mother-of-one, had the operation while listening to a hypnotist at the Henri Mondor hospital in Creteil near Paris. Gilles Dhonneur, head of anaesthesia and intensive care departments, carried out the delicate operation in April. One small slip of his scalpel could have destroyed Miss Kante's voice forever. Scroll down for video . Professional singer Alama Kante, a married mother-of-one, sang as a tumour was removed from her throat so surgeons didn't damage her vocal cords . Ms Kante, originally from Guinea, was first given a local anesthetic and then hypnotised by Asmaa Khaled. She then went into a trance and imagined she had travelled to Africa while surgeons removed the tumour . Alama Kante had the operation while listening to a hypnotist at the Henri Mondor hospital in Creteil near Paris . Ms Kante had a parathyroid gland tumour but feared having it removed in case she lost her voice. According to Mr Dhonneur, the only way of knowing if her vocal chords had been protected was to get Miss Kante to sing during the procedure. She sang two songs from her album Generation Sabbar which is about modern African society and To-long which means 'fight and get what you want'. Ms Kante, originally from Guinea, was first given a local anesthetic and then hypnotised by Asmaa Khaled. She then went into a trance and imagined she had travelled to Africa. 'Because she was singing during the crictical moments, we could be sure that the operation was going well', said Professor Dhonneur. Ms Kante had a parathyroid gland tumour but feared having it removed in case she lost her voice . Ms Kante, who now lives on the outskirts of Paris, said the experience is difficult to explain. She said: 'There was a woman next to me who said, don't worry everything will be fine. 'She asked me to go on a journey and I said okay and she said I was going to Senegal. 'It's as though I was not in the operating theatre at all, I was far away in Senegal.' Despite the hypnosis, Ms Kante said she did feel pain at one point during the operation but when the hypnotist told her it would go, it did. According to The Times, Ms Kante has now made a full recovery and hopes to produce a record in UK. The parathyroid glands are four tiny glands, located in the neck, that control the body's calcium levels. Each gland is about the size of a grain of rice. Normal parathyroid glands work like the thermostat in your home to keep blood calcium levels in a very tightly controlled range. When the blood calcium level is too low, PTH is released to bring the calcium level back up to normal. When the calcium level is normal or gets a little too high, normal parathyroids will stop releasing PTH. Proper calcium balance is crucial to the normal functioning of the heart, nervous system, kidneys, and bones. However, the area where they are found at the base of the neck is tricky to operate on because they are close to blood vessels and nerves. One slip and the vocal cord can be permanently paralysed leaving the patient with a husky voice.","Alama Kante was operated on at the Henri Mondor hospital near Paris .

"By . Sally Lee . and Lillian Radulova . John Gasovski, 48, was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head on Sunday morning . The Sydney father-of-four whose body was found at the Jamberoo Mountain Lookout with a gunshot wound to the head may have been involved in organised crime, say police. The body of John Gasovski, 48, was found on Sunday morning dumped in bushland. A coroner's report said the Arncliffe man was killed by a single gunshot wound to the head in an 'execution-style' killing. Police believe he had become involved with organised crime figures who had links to drugs. 'Police are examining any possible links between Mr Gasovski and organised crime. Drugs are one line of inquiry,' a police spokesperson told MailOnline. 'He involved himself in some way with criminal identities and we are trying to identify who those individual are.' Police also revealed that they did not think Mr Gasovski's body had been lying in the bush for long before it was found, though they are waiting for forensic results to confirm the time frame. Police are also investigating Mr Gasovski's whereabouts in the days preceding his death, saying they were not confident he even went to Canberra as he told his family, or remained in the Lake Illawarra/Wollongong area. Mr Gasovski advised his family that he was going on a business trip to Canberra on Monday June 9 and that he would return the following day. After no sign of him, his family contacted police to report him missing by June 12.Jackie Gasovski, the wife of the deceased, told the Mail Online that she is 'wracked with grief'. 'My husband was a good man and a good husband and he loved his children and his friends,' Jackie Gasovski said. 'He will be missed by everyone.' Police Strike Force Berek, comprising of detectives from Lake Illawarra, St George and State Crime Command's Homicide Squad, are investigating the movements of Mr Gasovski's, leading up to his death.

"By . Wills Robinson . 'Exceptional officer': Captain James Townley, 29, was found dead in a toilet cubicle just a week after being deployed at a base in the Nad-e Ali district . An army officer who was found dead in a toilet block in Afghanistan with gunshot wounds to his head, placed himself under a lot of pressure to succeed, an inquest has heard. Captain James Townley, 29, from Glastonbury, Somerset, had a first class degree and was described as an 'exceptional officer' who was 'unbelievably clever'. But an inquest in Wells heard that Oxford Graduate Cpt Townley was like a 'coiled spring' who put himself under immense strain. He was found dead the day before his 30th birthday and only a week into his deployment at the Shawqat base in the Nad-e Ali district. Three empty bullet cartridges were found on the floor of the the cubicle next to a pistol. Colleagues said it was unlikely his death was an accident or that enemy action was involved. His room mate, Captain Christopher Finbow, said Cpt Townley got up unusually early and left their tent at around 6.30am on 21 September 2012. Cpt Finbow did not hear gunshots but entered the toilet and shower block one minute and 56 seconds later to find blood coming from inside the third cubicle. He told the inquest: 'At the time I made the assumption that someone had shot themselves or had suffered a nasty accident. 'There was blood on the floor which was coming from inside the cubicle. I hadn’t heard anything to concern me - I definitely hadn’t heard gunfire.' Colleagues used a knife to unlock the door and found Cpt Townley sitting on the toilet but slumped to the floor with gunshot wounds to the head. He was found with a Sig Sauer 9mm pistol - a weapon which soldiers would carry with them at all times. Up to three empty bullet cases were on the floor of the cubicle and there was a bullet hole in the wall, the inquest heard. Just three minutes and 18 seconds after Townley had entered the block he was on a stretcher, en route to the base’s medical centre. Medics battled to save the officer’s life but he was later pronounced dead at Camp Bastion, Helmand Province. Cpt Townley’s colleagues told the inquest that they did not know him well as he had only recently been posted to Shawqat operating base. Treatment: Captain Townley was pronounced dead at Camp Bastion. Doctors tried desperately to save him but he died a short time later . However, there was nothing to suggest an underlying issue. Regiment Sergeant Major Andrew Faupel of the Corps of Royal Engineers said: “He came across as quiet and reserved. 'From what I could see James put himself under a lot of pressure to do a good job. 'He was trying to do a good job, and do the job to the best of his ability. He was a coiled spring. 'But I don’t know much about him and I’m not sure whether that behaviour was normal.' His colleagues told the court it was unlikely his death would have been an accident. Lieutenant Timothy Barker said: 'You need a conscious, positive thought to discharge the weapon, it is not something that could be done by accident. 'I believe it was a self-inflicted gun-shot wound. I did not think it was a green on blue threat, which is where rogue members of Afghan security take out British troops.' 'Unbelievably clever': The Oxford graduate, who also worked as a tax associate at Pricewaterhouse Cooper, had only been at the base for a week . Captain Duncan Fraser added: 'At the evening briefing James was asked questions by the commander. 'He appeared to be hesitant and he was swallowing a lot more than you would usually expect a person to.' Cpt Townley, of 28 Engineer Regiment, had a first class degree in engineering and computer science from Oxford University . He worked as a tax associate for Pricewaterhouse Coopers before attending the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. The five-day inquest continues.

"By . Ryan Lipman . An experiment in tapping into the student psyche through one of the most popular television series of the moment has has worked spectacularly for staff in at University of Sydney. Student marketing and communications team manager David Als and his staff had a timely idea to provide students with some light relief during the exam period, which also coincided with the final episode of this season's Game of Thrones episode on Monday night. 'The video is a simple and fun way to show that we have similar interests to students,' Mr Als told Daily Mail Australia. 'We've created a bit of light relief and acknowledged that even though exams are looming, we are all here for the same thing - to grow, learn and in the students' case, to graduate.'

A drone shot aerial footage of the university's towers and quadrangles to give it a Game of Thrones feel . Popular culture: Student marketing and communications team manager David Als said the video had tapped into the student psyche and spoke to them in a language they converse in. Pictured are characters Tyrion Lannister, left and Joffrey Baratheon . The university’s organist and carillonist Amy Johansen plays the theme song to rolling Game of Throne-style text in the video. 'Winter is coming. Winter is here. Semester gathers, and now my studies begin. I am the watcher on the Wentworth Building, I am the keeper of the quad,' it reads. 'For exams are dark and full of terrors, I pledge my mind and slumber to graduation, for this semester and all semesters to come.' The video was shot about three to four weeks ago using a drone to show off the university's sandstone towers and buildings, quadrangles and lawns and aerial shots of the areas surrounding the campus, including Newtown. Also featured in the video is Ms Johansen playing the theme song. The video took about 10 hours to put together including some special effects .

'We've put more work in this time, to make this more relevant,' he said. With his team looking after student relations internally and marketing for prospective students, Mr Als said the video was put together in less than 10 hours, including special effects to give it a winter feel. But with it quickly going viral, Mr Als said he and his team were 'astonished' at the reaction and he considered it a 'great return on investment.'

"By . Damien Gayle . Former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon has admitted he contemplated suicide when he realised he was getting dementia, which he blames on the punishment he sucked up during this football career. He said he would leave home and forget how to get back and spend weeks at a time in a darkened room because the pain in his head was so bad. In his darkest moments, he said, he thought of ending his life. Scroll down for video . Former NFL football quarterback Jim McMahon speaks during a news conference in Chicago where he told reporters of his ongoing battle with dementia that he believe is related the punishment of pro football . 'I am glad I don't have any weapons in my house or else I am pretty sure I wouldn't be here,' he said. 'It got to be that bad.' McMahon is one of several players in a federal lawsuit filed last month in California that accuses teams of dishing out powerful drugs to keep players on the field despite injuries. He is also part of a class-action lawsuit which the NFL has agreed to settle for $765million without admitting it hid the risk of concussion from players. McMahon, 54, spoke about his struggles with dementia and depression with a small group of reporters, including Associated Press sports writer Andrew Seligman, yesterday. He was clear that he believes his health problems were brought on by the beating he suffered as a professional footballer. McMahon playing with the Chicago Bears in 1983. He said he had three to five diagnosed concussions and, he believes, many more that went undiagnosed . McMahon said he had three to five diagnosed concussions and who knows how many more that went undiagnosed, reported the Associated Press. He also suffered injuries to his kidney, broken ribs, an addiction to painkillers and even a broken neck he claims that team doctors never told him about. It was only five years ago, after X-rays and an MRI, that doctors told him he had broken his neck at some point. McMahon believes it happened while he was playing with the Minnesota Vikings in 1993, when he got sandwiched by two Giants defenders in a playoff game at New York - and was left unable to move his legs. Eventually he made it off the field but, after just 10 minutes, 'like an idiot' decided to get back on the pitch. Another slight graze to his head and his legs went numb again, forcing him out of the game. McMahon told the reporters that despite the match-ending injury, a doctor only asked him how he felt and did not examine him. He said there's 'no doubt about it', the team knew his neck was broken, AP reports. The news agency asked the Vikings for comment, but had received no reply by the time its writer Mr Seligman published his story. McMahon's dementia diagnosis came at about the same time he learned of his broken neck. He had begun having trouble remembering names of people he'd met, and even people he knew for years. Then he started getting lost after leaving his house, suffering mood swings, and holing up in his bedroom in the dark for weeks on end, leaving only if he had an appearance to make. 'I can see how some of these guys have ended their lives, because of the pain,' AP quoted McMahon as saying. The more than 4,800 former players who are party to the concussion lawsuit had alleged the NFL misled players about the long-term dangers the brain injuries posed. The lawsuit doesn't specify which medical problems are suffered by the retired players. But it says they have included headaches, dizziness, loss of memory, dementia, depression, impulse control, impulsivity to anger, physical disability, embarrassment, and a 'loss of the pleasures of life'. And it is similar in wording to several previous lawsuits, accusing the NFL of 'carelessness, negligence, intentional misconduct and concealment of information' directly connected with the players' injuries. McMahon messages his head and neck after game against the New England Patriots in Chicago. He also suffered injuries to his kidney, broken ribs, a painkillers addiction and even a broken neck he says he wasn't told about . The 18-page document, seen by MailOnline, says the plaintiffs are seeking damages to be decided by a jury for long-term or chronic injuries, along with funds for medical treatment. 'For over 40 years [the NFL] have continuously and fervently denied that it knew, should have known or believed there to be any relationship between NFL players suffering concussions while playing, the NFL policies concerning tackling methodology,' the complaint says. It adds that evidence showing concussion causes the brain condition amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been readily available 'for more than 100 years'. The complaint notes that the most dangerous tackles - where players used their heads as a 'weapon' - were outlawed in the late 1970s. But it adds that the laws were not well-enforced, saying: 'The NFL wanted to keep its fan base excited by the visual exhilaration witnessing such hazardous techniques. 'Despite the NFL’s knowledge of such dangerous practices and the increased risk of head injury to the players, the NFL turned a blind eye for decades.' McMahon is bitter about the way the NFL has treated former players. 'The NFL continues to make billions and billions of dollars every year, and some of these guys are homeless,' he was quoted as saying. 'They don't know who they are, and they were the ones who built this brand to where it's at.'","52-year-old suffers from memory loss - even forgetting his way home .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A science . teacher who pretended she had cancer and even . swabbed colleagues for DNA to see if they could save her life by . donating tissue has been struck off today. Samantha Scrine, 26, from Swansea, was banned from the classroom after claiming she was dying from a rare form of stomach cancer. Miss Scrine took DNA swabs from her workmates pretending she needed to find out if they could donate bone marrow in a last bid save her life. Tribunal: Samantha Scrine, 26, pretended she had a rare stomach cancer. She was struck off the teaching register today despite telling the panel 'stress' had made her think she was dying of the terminal illness . She claimed she was undergoing . radiotherapy and was too ill to teach - and her school then arranged for . cover at a cost of £5,500. She even gave her school a funeral pack with a CD of songs she wanted to be played at her funeral. But when staff at Gowerton Comprehensive School in . Swansea, South Wales, approached her family, they revealed she was was not ill but she was suffering from depression. She was then sacked from work in June last year before appearing at a disciplinary panel. There Miss Scrine claimed she had 'lost her head' and stress had made her believe she was terminally ill. The panel decided she had acted dishonestly for around nine months - and removed her from the teaching register. She appealed to save her career by not . being struck off. But the disciplinary panel of the General Teaching . Council for Wales feared she may do it again. Fantasy: Miss Scrine convinced colleagues at Gowerton Comprehensive School in Swansea, South Wales, that she had cancer for eight months. She even took DNA swabs to see if they were bone marrow matches . Panel chairman Peter Williams said: 'Miss Scrine’s behaviour was dishonest, preplanned and persistent. 'This . was a very serious case of unacceptable professional conduct. The . conduct was deliberate. A number of her actions must have involved . significant preplanning. 'It was a serious abuse of colleagues which impacted on them professionally, emotionally and in their private lives.' Mr Williams said: 'We accept she may at some point have had a mistaken belief she had cancer. 'But her behaviour was dishonest. The extensive preplanning and embellishment of her condition was deliberate. 'She poses a significant risk of repeating her dishonest behaviour. 'This behaviour is fundamentally incompatible with Miss Scrine remaining a registered teacher.' Claims: The science teacher gave her school a 'funeral pack' with songs she wanted played at her funeral . Presenting . officer Louise Price said: 'Miss Scrine’s behaviour impacted on the . school and the students by denying them continuous, uninterrupted . education. 'But . it had the biggest effect on her colleagues, who were tearful and upset . as well as feeling shameful and struggling to trust each other.' Miss Scrine backed up her story by sending thousands of text messages pretending to be her own mother. She claimed she was suffering from the effects of gallstones which led her to believe she had cancer. Miss Scrine claimed she would go to hospital waiting rooms and take pain medication to cope with her symptoms. She . invented stories about her fellow hospital patients, claiming she had . befriended a 10-year-old girl who had later died of cancer. She admited making false statements, . obtaining DNA swabs under false pretences and falsifying documents from . Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board. Earlier in the hearing, presenting officer Louise Price told the tribunal: 'She told the school she had been diagnosed with inoperable cancer. 'She . said she had found a lump in her stomach but there was no treatment due . to its location and she wasn't sure how much time she had to live. 'Miss Scrine said she had arranged radiotherapy for outside class time but she started to miss school due to illness. 'She claimed . the cancer had spread to her hip and texted fellow teachers asking for a . DNA samples to be taken to see if they were a match. 'She . took swabs from a number of teachers and members of their family. Some . of them received a letter from the hospital thanking them for their . swabs.' The hearing in Cardiff was told how teachers at the school claim they will never trust each other again. In a statement one unnamed colleague said they couldn't believe they had been taken in by her 'attention seeking lies'.","Samantha Scrine, 26, pretended she had a rare form of stomach cancer .

"By . Wills Robinson . Demanding a correction: Albert Gifford, 15, from Shepton Mallet, Somerset, has taken on BMW over the use of a slogan used in a recent advert . A schoolboy who forced Tesco to change the wording on its orange juice cartons because of a grammatical error has now taken on BMW to challenge a slogan used in an advert. Albert Gifford, 15, from Shepton Mallet, Somerset, has been engaged in a month-long . email exchange with the motoring firm in a bid to alter a phrase in the new clip promoting the BMW 2 Series . Coupe. The advert, which was shown during a recent trip to the cinema with his family, ends with the slogan: 'it bites as bad as it barks'. BMW staff say it is a play on . words but the schoolboy insists the slogan should be corrected - because . bad is not an adverb. It follows a complaint he made to the supermarket giants in March. He sparked a major rebrand after questioning their use of the phrase ‘most tastiest’, rather than ‘tastiest’ or ‘most tasty' on the packaging of Tesco-brand juice. On May 19 Albert sent his first complaint to BMW via their website. A customer service executive from the company responded two weeks later, saying they appreciated feedback and promised they would look into the matter. The email also stated that the firm 'understood' Albert's frustration 'especially as it distracted his cinematic experience.' Albert, who has now been informed the advert will not be changed despite his plea, told Mail Online: 'I . can understand that they want to use short and snappy slogans in their . campaigns, but a company like BMW should at least come up with something . that is accurate. 'I was at the . cinema with my family a few weeks ago to watch Godzilla and I noticed . the trailer for the new 2 Series. 'I was frustrated because ""bad"" is not an adverb - as any semi-literate eight year old could tell you. 'A couple of weeks after I contacted them, I got fed up of waiting for them, so I emailed them again.' 'I also tried to get in contact with someone in the advertising department - but all they said was they had logged my complaint.' Scroll down for video . Bad grammar? The slogan in question is used during a clip promoting the new BMW 2 Series Coupe . Wording: The schoolboy noticed the slogan at the end of the advert and told the multi-national company it spoiled the film for him . Ashley Parker, the BMW Customer Service Executive dealing with the complaint, said: 'It has been logged in our system and we have contacted our advertising department, but the advert is not going to change. 'This is the first time I have seen or heard of anything like this on the site.' Albert is currently studying for his GCSEs and is preparing for his last exam on Friday - Further Maths. The timing is frustrating for the schoolboy because the crucial test is the day after his school prom. Spotting the mistake: Albert, pictured when he challenged Tesco over the use of a phrase on a juice carton, said his strict attitude towards grammar comes from his parents . Next year he is starting at a sixth form college and has his sights on a career in medicine. He added: 'I would like to go to a top university. Obviously I would love to go somewhere like Oxford or Cambridge, but have not decided yet. 'I have had about 20 exams so far and am predicted to an get A* in almost all of them.' Albert . believes his stringent attitude towards grammar comes from his parents. He even flags up mistakes in his classmates' work. 'My friends sometimes get frustrated when I look at their work, but some of them find it funny,' he said. Standing firm: A customer services representative from BMW said they had logged Albert's complaint, but were not going to change the wording used in the advert . Albert's battle with BMW over their use of bad grammar follows a clash with Tesco over the wording on their juice cartons . The email exchange between Albert Gifford and Ashley Parker, a Customer Service Executive, began on May 19. May 19 (written in query box on the BMW website) Albert: 'I was at the cinema recently, watching Godzilla, when I saw an advert for the new BMW 2 Series Coupé. But the whole advert was ruined by the slogan “it bites as bad as it barks”. This is grammatically incorrect, as ‘bad’ is not an adverb, so cannot be used in this context. 'The word “badly” would be acceptable or even more exciting alternatives like 'fiercely'. It would also be correct to say “its bite is as bad as its bark”. I was distracted with it throughout Godzilla, and didn’t enjoy it fully.' May 22 (email in reply) Dear Mr Gifford . Thank you for your online enquiry dated May 19, 2014. I am sorry to learn of your disappointment in relation to the phrasing which featured in the advertisement for the BMW 2 Series Coupé.

Please feel free to contact me, should you require any further assistance. Yours sincerely . BMW UK . Ashley Parker . Customer Service Executive . June 3 (email from Albert) Hello, . I would like to point out that a response was promised to me regarding my grammar issue, and it has been a few days, under any definition of the phrase 'a few', as the email was sent on the 22nd of May and it is now the 3rd of June. The reference number for my comments is 1-18618938273 if that helps quicken the process. June 5 (second response justifying the use of the phrase) Dear Mr Gifford . Thank you for your further email dated June 3, 2014. I am sorry to learn of your continued disappointment in relation to the phrasing which featured in the advertisement for the BMW 2 Series Coupé. The advertisement for the BMW 2 Series Coupe is supported by the strap line, 'Bites as bad as it barks'. The way that this line is presented is deliberate as it draws its intelligence from playing on the well known phrase and duality of this being a BMW with an edge. During the advertisement you will hear the bark and so the ‘promise’ is what you would expect from such a bark which is the bite. I thank you once again for providing us with your feedback. I trust that the information provided, clarifies our decision on the advertisement. Yours sincerely . BMW UK . Ashley Parker . June 5 . Dear Mr Parker, . Thank you for your response. It did indeed clarify why you chose the slogan, but I had already decoded the very intelligent reference to a well-known phrase. I would, however, like to point out that it is still grammatically incorrect. The phrase you are referring to is 'its bark is worse than its bite', or 'it barks worse than it bites' in a few cases. I have never heard the word 'bad' used in this particular saying, but if it were, it would look something like 'its bark is more bad than its bark' or 'it barks more badly than it bites' (as you can see, these are hardly correct.) In no well-known saying is 'bad' used as an adverb. You can look it up in a dictionary if you like, and it will describe it as an ADJECTIVE (and maybe even a noun), which it is. If the strap line draws its intelligence from the incorrect grammar using 'bad' as an adverb, in a 'promise' to viewers regarding the literacy rates at the BMW marketing department, I would of course have no quarrel with anything. My kindest regards, . Albert Gifford . June 9 . Dear Mr Gifford . Thank you for your further email dated June 5, 2014. Once again, I am sorry to learn that the phrasing which featured in the advertisement for the BMW 2 Series Coupé, has caused you continued disappointment.

My colleagues in our Advertising department have also been made fully aware of your correspondence.

Yours sincerely . BMW UK . Ashley Parker . June 9 . Dear Mr Parker, . By 'researched' I hope you mean that you have realised that the phrase is incorrect and it is imperative that it is changed.

"By . Lydia Warren . The father of a five-year-old girl who was killed in Nebraska's tornadoes on Monday is heading to the state to plan her funeral - while her mother remains in a coma unaware of her child's death. Elijah Dixon, who lives in Athens, Alabama, learned about the death of his daughter, Calista Dixon, while he was bartending at an Applebee's in Madison on Monday, his manager told AL.com. 'This is the most . heartbreaking thing I have ever been through,' he in a Facebook post on Tuesday. His other daughter, four-year-old Robin, and her brother, 21-year-old Cody Murphree, were unhurt when the rare dual tornadoes barreled through their mobile home in Pilger. Torn apart: Calista Dixon, bottom left, was killed in the tornadoes in Pilger, Nebraska on Monday, while her mother, Kandi Murphee, is in a coma. Her sister Robin and brother Cody, both pictured, survived . But their sister and mother, 42-year-old . Kandi Murphree, were found surrounded by debris and lying in a road . nearby and rushed to hospital. Murphree sustained a brain and leg injury when the twister . struck and has been put in a medically-induced coma, meaning she does not know her daughter has passed away. The tragedy comes just four months after she moved her family to Pilger from Huntsville, . Alabama when her elderly parents asked if she would help them. Her mother Kay Labenz, 69, told the Omaha World-Herald that she had asked her daughter to move to help her as she underwent surgery and her father, Les, who has a muscular problem. After . initially staying with her parents, Murphree moved her children into . their own home and found a job as a cashier and was grateful for her . parents' help looking after her brood, the World-Herald reported. On Monday, . Murphree finished her shift at Prime Stop in Wayne, picked up her girls . from her mother's home and took them to their place down the street.

Destruction: An aerial photographs shows the wreckage strewn throughout Pilger on Tuesday . Her son, Cody, was at work installing shingles when he got the news that tornadoes were heading towards his new hometown. He called his mother and told her to seek shelter immediately. After the tornado hit, Labenz frantically . tried to contact her daughter and sent Cody to Faith Regional Medical . Center in Norfolk, where most victims had been sent. There he found that his little sister Calista had passed away. 'From . what I hear, they were trying to make it to across the street to either . the bank or the gas station, but by that time it was just too late and . everything hit,' Murphree said. After calling other Omaha hospitals, . the family learned that Murphree was at Creighton University Medical . Center in critical condition. Cody added that his sister was a beautiful girl who dreamed of becoming a doctor when she grew up. The . twister destroyed scores of homes as it barreled through Pilger, . killing Calista and 74-year-old David A. Herout. At least 19 others were . taken to hospitals with injuries. Killed: 74-year-old David A. Herout, pictured, also lost his life in the Nebraska tornadoes on Monday . Mr Herout, of Clarkson, was killed after his vehicle left a county road east of Pilger, and he was ejected from the car. Up to 75 per cent of the buildings in Pilger were heavily damaged or destroyed. The tornado crushed much of the small downtown, leaving piles of bricks that had been storefronts in the street. Between 45 and 50 homes in Pilger were demolished, about a dozen others were damaged beyond repair in Dixon County. Cody . Murphee's coworkers have established a fund to help temporarily feed and . clothe him and Robin, who lost their belongings in the storm.

"By . Sarah Michael . The idea to quit their jobs and buy a school bus started off as a joke. But for six Australian friends the idea took hold, and five months later they are in the middle of an epic road trip around the United States in a bus they gutted and renovated themselves. The young professionals - including a lawyer, a financial advisor and an engineer – started in Canada and have since driven through 18 states from the West Coast to the East Coast of the US. Scroll down for video . Friends (from left) Chris Crawford, Gerard Martin, Charlie Green, Olivia Murdoch, Lindsay Crawford and Matt McIver quit their jobs to travel across Canada and the US . The friends bought an old school bus, gutted it, renovated it and nicknamed it the 'Spruce Moose'. Here it is pictured in Montana . Charlie Green, 24, who worked in Sydney as a financial advisor before deciding to quit his job and join his friends in Canada, said the group got the idea off another guy's website after he converted a bus into a recreational vehicle. 'It was pretty much one of those situations where [friend] Matt [McIver] brought it up one day - hankboughtabus.com - and we just thought that was really cool,' Mr Green told MailOnline. At the beginning of the year Mr McIver, also 24, had just finished his university degree in Brisbane and was on a working holiday in Banff, Canada. He persuaded his friends Lindsay Crawford, 24, Gerard Martin, 24, Chris Crawford, 22, Olivia Murdoch, 21, and Mr Green to quit their various jobs and come join him to work as ski lift operators in Banff. The journey has seen them travel from Canada through US states including Montana, Idaho, Utah (pictured), Nevada, Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania . The young professionals - including a lawyer, a financial advisor and an engineer - said the idea to buy a bus 'started off as a joke'. The group is pictured in Idaho . After searching online and finding a bus resale company, the group found themselves in Calgary, purchasing a school bus. 'It kind of started as a joke, like ""How funny would it be if we did this"",' Mr McIver said. 'Then it escalated to Gerard and I looking for buses, then we found a bus, then we bought a bus. 'It kind of just went from one of those crazy ideas to ""We are actually doing this"".' Their journey has seen them meet some interesting characters – including some elderly people in Arizona who were preparing for an apocalypse – and they even ran into former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard on the street in Washington DC. When they bought the vehicle in Calgary, Canada, it was an iconic yellow school bus but they stripped it and painted it white . None of the friends had renovated a bus before but Mr Martin, a mechanical engineer, did most of the carpentry and Chris Crawford did the digital design . 'We were drinking beers and walking along and she was walking towards us as we crossed the street,' Mr McIver said. 'I was just like ""Hey Jules!"" and she was on the phone but she stopped and excused herself and shook our hands. 'It was hilarious.' The group – most of who went to school together in Toowoomba, Queensland - purchased the bus at the end of January. It took two and a half months to renovate, during breaks in between skiing in Banff, Canada, and they worked in temperatures as cold as minus 30 degrees . The bus is nicknamed the Spruce Moose, because the friends lived on Moose St and they are Simpsons fans . It took two and a half months to renovate in temperatures as cold as minus 30 degrees. 'We did it on our days off while we weren't skiing,' Mr McIver said. 'Gerard is a pretty handy guy, he's a mechanical engineer, and he did most of the carpentry. 'Chris has finished an architecture degree so he did the digital design.' It was a yellow school bus when they bought it but they stripped everything out. After gutting the bus they covered the inside with plywood and insulated it before putting timber floor panels down . 'Getting rid of the seats was probably the hardest part, it was ridiculously cold because we had to go under the bus to undo the bolts because they were fixed to the bottom.' They then covered the inside with plywood and insulated it before putting timber floor panels down. The bus is nicknamed the Spruce Moose, because the friends lived on Moose St and they are Simpsons fans. On April 13 they left Canada to drive to Coachella Music Festival in California, and they finished painting it white the day before they left. The group of friends - most of who know each other from high school in Toowoomba - say the best part of their trip has been the people they have met along the way . The friends pictured at an Elvis Presley museum in Memphis, Tennessee . To get to California they drove through Montana, Idaho, Utah, Nevada and Arizona. After the festival they drove through Arizona again, then New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania. Along the way they've been documenting their journey on their Project Moose Facebook Page. They park their bus in RV parks and sleep in it on the beds they customised themselves. 'We try to meet all the families and older people staying in the RV parks,' Mr McIver said. 'Everyone has been really nice and looked after us. 'The best part of the trip has been all the people that we've met.' Two of the boys ran into former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard on the street in Washington DC while they were drinking beers . The group only has three weeks left on their US visas, so from Pennsylvania they will travel to New York and Boston. After that they will split up, with some going back to Canada and others returning to jobs in Australia. Mr McIver said the friends wouldn't have done anything differently – except for 'maybe buying a bus that had air conditioning'. 'I would say I guess there was a certain amount of risk, people think ""That would be a cool idea to do"" but a lot of people wouldn't have the perseverance or commitment to stick it out. 'We have a saying – ""Everything comes up moose"" – because for us there's always a solution. 'If something seems bad it always works out in the best possible way.'

"By . Chris Pleasance . One of the most prolific serial killers in LA's history, who is already on death row for killing ten women in the Eighties and Nineties, was convicted of four more murders yesterday. Chester Turner, 47, was found guilty of strangling the women in South Los Angeles between 1987 and 1997. Prosecutors said DNA evidence linked him to the killings. Jurors deliberated less than a day before finding the former Domino's pizza deliveryman guilty of first-degree murder with special allegations that make him eligible for the death penalty again, according to a statement from the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. Chester Turner, 47, dubbed one of LA's most prolific serial killers by prosecutors, has been found guilty of four more murders. He is already on death row, convicted of ten other killings in the Eighties and Nineties . Turner (pictured in a police mugshot and during his first trial) was one of at least three serial killers who murdered women in Los Angeles in the 1980s and 1990s - dubbed the Southside Slayings . Turner had already been convicted and sentenced to death in 2007 for killing 10 women, including one who was six months pregnant. Turner was jailed for ten years to life for the murder of the unborn baby, known as 'Baby Washington' after his mother, Regina Washington. Authorities say Turner was one of at least three serial killers who stalked the Los Angeles-area during a crack cocaine epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s that led some women into prostitution to support their drug habits. The attacks were dubbed the 'Southside Slayer' killings before authorities concluded more than one attacker was involved. Turner moved to LA when he was five years old with his mother after his parents separated. He dropped out of high school, then moved into homeless missions as a young man when his mother moved back to Utah. During that time he attacked women, usually raping them before strangling them to death. He was jailed seven times between 1995 and 2002, mostly for minor crimes. Turner raped and strangled his victims in the area around Figueroa Street (pictured) in a corridor that ran from 108th Street to East Gage Avenue . His connection to the murders was only established after he was jailed for raping a woman in 2002 and was forced to give a DNA sample, which was matched to other samples taken from his victims. During the investigation officers began to look at other similar cases in the area where Turner was operating, and reopened the case of homeless drug addict David Allen Jones. Jones was convicted of three murders, but DNA evidence linked Turner to two of them. Police cannot prove, but strongly suspect, that Turner is also responsible for the third. Following the revelations, Jones was released from jail having served 11 years behind bars, and sued the state for $720,000. Two years ago, Michael Hughes was sentenced to death for strangling a 15-year-old girl and two women. He previously got life for four more killings. Former mechanic Lonnie Franklin Jr. has pleaded not guilty to 10 so-called 'Grim Sleeper' killings and the attempted murder of another woman that took place between 1985 and 2007. The victims were strangled or shot and dumped in alleys near his South Los Angeles home.","Chester Turner jailed in 2007 for the murders of ten women in Los Angeles .

Baby wombats have very long care periods with their mothers – usually 12-18 months – and at his age it would be too distressing for Ringo to stay in the zoo overnight. So for the next two months he will be staying with the 25-year-old, who lives in a share house with her partner and three other housemates. 'He wakes up and he calls for me,' Ms Costelloe told MailOnline. 'They make these weird noises, it's like a ""tss tss"" and I give him cuddle. 'Basically he just needs to know that mum's there.' He spends his days at the zoo in the exhibit but he needs to be monitored by a keeper at all times. 'He comes basically everywhere I go,' she said. He's hungry! Ringo gets a feed from his adopted 25-year-old mother, munching down on a carrot . When Ringo is 12 months old he will undergo a 'soft release' in order to familiarise him the zoo at night . The 10-month-old wombat likes to snuggle in bed with Ms Costelloe's partner Alvin while she dresses for work . Ms Costelloe said taking care of Ringo was very tiring, but also very rewarding. 'I've got a puppy that's 11 months old, and when I get up at 3am and have to give Ringo a cuddle the puppy's jumping around like a toddler and he's sooking like baby. 'It's reminded me I don't want to have kids for a long time.' Ms Costelloe said her housemates are 'very tolerant and accepting' and they have agreed to let her use a second bathroom in the house as a temporary wombat enclosure. Her housemates also babysit Ringo if she has to go out at night. Her partner Alvin, who she shares a room with, lets Ringo cuddle in bed every morning as Ms Costelloe dresses for work. 'I retrieve him and give him to my partner and he just keeps on sleeping and lets the wombat hang out on the bed while I get ready,' she said. Ringo needs to be fed a bottle every eight hours and Ms Costelloe and her partner often have to wake up in the middle of the night to feed him . Ms Costelloe, who lives in a share house with four other people, said her housemates were 'very tolerant' The tiny marsupial has become good friends with the zookeeper's dog Elke and they often play together . Ringo has also become good friends with Ms Costelloe's dog Elke, and they often play outside together or lie next to each other in Elke's dog bed. When Ringo is 12 months old he will undergo a 'soft release' in order to familiarise him with staying at the zoo overnight. 'We will start him staying over one night a week, then back to my place, so it's not too much of a drastic change.' Ringo was rescued from his mother's pouch after she was hit by a car and killed on the side of the road in Nowra on the South Coast of NSW. 'This happens to a lot of wombats, a lot of wombats dies in this way,' Ms Costelloe said. 'We are trying to get the message out to people that if they see a dead wombat on the side of the road, if it's a female there's a good chance there's a young in the pouch. The Sydney Zoo are trying to spread the message that people should look for babies hidden in the pouches of dead wombats by the side of the road . Ringo made his debut at WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo on Thursday and will become a feature of the Outback Adventure Show . Ringo was rescued from his mother's pouch after she was hit by a car and killed on the side of the road in Nowra on the South Coast of NSW . 'They may end up starving to death but they can live up to two days.' When Ringo was rescued he weighed just 950 grams. He currently weighs about 6.5kg but could grow to be up to 30kg. Ringo made his public debut on Thursday, and he will be a regular feature in the Outback Adventure Show. Ms Costelloe said adding Ringo to the show would help raise awareness for the critically endangered northern hairy-nosed wombat. 'There are fewer than 200 individuals left in the world, it's possible that they'll go instinct in our lifetime,' she said. 'While Ringo is what we call a common wombat he's an ambassador for all wombats, it's important for him to come out in the shows.' Ringo's species, the northern hairy-nosed wombat, is extremely rare - there are fewer than 200 left in the world . Three young animal enthusiasts from WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo’s Junior Conservationist program were there to witness Ringo's debut. From left: Darcy Needham, seven, Varsha Kumar, 12, and Harry Lawson, seven . How could you say no to this face? Ringo has become a huge hit with the public and is considered by the zoo to be a wombat ambassador'","Baby wombat's mother was killed by a car so he lives with his zookeeper .

So its no wonder that these special-edition Prudence condoms, available only in Brazil, have been branded the unofficial contraceptive of the World Cup. Coloured yellow and green like the national team's strip, they are flavoured to taste like Brazil's signature cocktail, the Caipirinha, which is made with limes, sugar and cachaça, a kind of white rum. The 'official' condom of the World Cup: Prudence branded prophylactics sport the colours of the Brazilian flag and are flavoured, appropriately, like the nation's favourite cocktail . The Wall Street Journal reports that 700,000 packs of the 3.15 reais (83p) condoms have been sold at supermarkets and pharmacies in Brazil since hitting the stores in February. They are made by Malaysian firm Karex, the world's largest condom maker, which has just delivered a further 864,000 packs of the capirinha condoms to Brazil this week. The design and marketing of the condoms is handled by DKT International, a global family planning and HIV-prevention non-profit. DKT's Brazil director, Daniel Marun, told WSJ: 'Major sports or cultural events attract a great number of people and garner much attention, providing a good opportunity to spread a pleasurable and fun safe-sex message.' Brazil's World Cup has already been lauded as the 'sexiest tournament ever', with the sun and samba set to lead to plenty of something else, apparently. 'Sexiest World Cup ever': Brazil fans kiss after watching the Brazil-Mexico match at the World Cup on Tuesday . However, it has also reportedly led to an explosion of prostitution, prompting fears of the spread of AIDS. The efforts of DKT have been bolstered by those of UN HIV-prevention organisation UNAIDS, whose 'Protect The Goal' programme has has been handing out free condoms and HIV tests in World Cup cities. Brazil usually conducts HIV and AIDS prevention campaigns during the Carnival holiday, including widespread advertising and condom distribution. Aggressive HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention efforts in the South American country have been held up as a model for the developing world for more than a decade.",Hundreds of thousands have sold in Brazil since their launch in February .

"By . Stephen Wright . A poignant letter written by a dying woman to her two daughters explaining why she had left half her estate to her toyboy lover was revealed yesterday. Elizabeth Walker reminded  the pair they had previously received ‘substantial sums’ and that she had given up an inheritance from her own mother, urging her to leave her estate to them instead. She also begged her daughters to ‘understand and respect my decisions’ and hailed her younger lover  as a ‘faithful partner’ who ‘will need this support’. Jennifer Rowan (left) and Alison Walker (right) argue that her mother was irrational when she changed the will shortly before her death. Today a letter from their mother was revealed explaining her decision . Heartbreaking explanation: Sisters Alison and Jennifer had fought to keep the letter secret, but today it was revealed to the High Court . IT analyst Michael Badmin, 35, is . fighting Alison ‘Ally’ Walker, 31, and Jennifer Rowan, 32, for a share . of their mother’s £1.2 million farm set in 90 acres in Garlinge Green, . near Canterbury, Kent. Mrs . Walker died aged 53 in February 2010 from a brain tumour, barely a month . after creating her will, which left half of her estate to Mr Badmin, . with the other half split between her daughters. The . daughters claim their mother was in a ‘delusional and irrational’ state . when she signed the will and have asked a judge to tear it up. Mr . Badmin, from Sittingbourne, Kent, insists he should receive the money. He was in his early 20s when he met Mrs Walker and their relationship . ‘began in earnest’ over Christmas 2005, the High Court in London was . told. The couple kept their relationship quiet until Mrs Walker . separated from her husband John, a property developer now aged 67. She . was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2009, apparently cutting her . daughters out of their expected inheritance just months later. In . her letter to her family, explaining her decision to give a huge chunk . of her fortune to her lover, Mrs Walker said she hoped the ‘division’ of . her estate was ‘adequate’, as ‘I want you all to be content’. ‘I . wanted to provide a benefit that would not only support Michael, but . one which would then go to help my family, so I hope you all understand . and feel that this is reasonable,’ she wrote. ‘I . feel I have done my best to provide for Ally and Jenny throughout my . life, and that you have both received substantial sums in terms of . inheritance over the years, which has given you both a good start to . your adult lives. I forwent my inheritance from my mother, requesting . her to leave it to both [of] you instead of taking it myself – so I hope . you appreciate that I have tried to do my best for you as I care for . you very much. ‘Your father . has not helped throughout the divorce process and sadly decided not to . agree to what I feel I should have been entitled to by law, using my low . life expectancy against me over the course of the mediation process. ‘It . was hard for him to come to an agreement, which I feel he should have . made more effort to come to under the circumstances, especially given my . prognosis. ‘As you know I . have decided to split my remaining estate between you all, giving 25 per . cent to Jenny, 25 per cent to Ally, with Michael receiving 50 per cent . as he has been my faithful partner for several years and I feel he will . need this support.’ Mrs Walker also said she had cut her husband John out of her will, because of his ‘obstructiveness’ in finalising their divorce. She . went on: ‘For Jenny and Ally, I feel your father should be able to help . you as the divorce settlement looks ultimately to be in his favour and . that I have given you the best I could in terms of bringing you up and . being a mother. I have always tried to give you both the best of . everything I have been able to, and I will always love you and your . children dearly.’ Miss . Walker and Mrs Rowan claim their mother ‘failed utterly to engage in the . process’ of making a will and relied on Mr Badmin to help draft it. Deputy High Court Judge Nicholas Strauss QC released the letter written by Mrs Walker, despite her daughters’ objections. The dispute centres on Mrs Walker’s mental capacity at the time the will was created. The case continues. Dear All, . As you will know I have left you all a division of my estate. I hope you feel that it is adequate given the circumstances as I want you all to be content. As you will now know, Michael has a lifetime interest in any property that I own, which will then pass on to Jenny and Ally. I would like to ask that [daughters] Jenny and Ally both make a Will to ensure that this may pass on to Phoebe and Owen, so that they may one day benefit from this, as is my intention. I wanted to provide a benefit that would not only support Michael, but one which would then go to help my family, so I hope you all understand and feel that this is reasonable. I feel I have done my best to provide for Ally and Jenny throughout my life, and that you have both received substantial sums in terms of inheritance over the years, which has given you both a good start to your adult lives. I forwent my inheritance from my Mother, requesting her to leave it to both [of] you instead of taking it myself - so I hope you appreciate that I have tried to do my best for you as I care for you very much. Your father has not helped throughout the divorce process and sadly decided not to agree to what I feel I should have been entitled to by law, using my low life expectancy against me over the course of the mediation process. It was hard for him to come to an agreement, which I feel he should have made more effort to come to under the circumstances, especially give my prognosis. As you know I have decided to split my remaining estate between you all, giving 25% to Jenny, 25% to Ally, with Michael receiving 50% as he has been my faithful partner for several years and I feel he will need this support. Due to John’s obstructiveness in finalising the divorce, we were unsure as to how much money would be left after our pressing expenses and the care I most likely will require throughout my illness. I hope there is enough to to help you in some way. John was uninterested in any of the above which saddened me greatly and I only hope he someday realises his unsympathetic view to my situation. John Vincent Walker has been excluded from my Will for this reason. Considering the possible future and writing this Will has been very hard for me, but the most important thing is that I wish the best for you all and my grandchildren in the future. I do hope you all understand and respect my decisions. For Jenny and Ally, I feel your father should be able to help you as the divorce settlement looks ultimately to be in his favour and that I have given you the best I could in terms of bringing you up and being a mother. I have always tried to give you both the best of everything I have been able to, and I will always love you and your children dearly. I love you all, . Best wishes, . Mum/Liz .

"It's the no-frills cash-and-carry chain popular with corner shopkeepers and restaurant owners. But it seems there is more to Costco than meets the eye. For the warehouse wholesaler has beaten leading high street chains in a customer satisfaction survey to find the best optician. The warehouse wholesaler Costco has beaten leading high street chains in a customer satisfaction survey to find the best optician . Customers were asked about their experience of buying glasses or lenses and having their eyes tested over the last three years. Costco came a very close second behind the ‘local independent optician’, and easily beat well-known brands such as Specsavers, Boots, Dollond & Aitchison and Tesco. The survey of 5,409 Which? members revealed Costco – usually associated with bulk food and drink purchases – provided value for money and a good service despite budget surroundings. The wholesaler scored 86 per cent (with local independents at 88 per cent) and Asda was third at 77 per cent. Specsavers was given a 72 per cent rating, slightly ahead of Boots and Dollond & Aitchison on 69 per cent. Tesco won a 65 per cent rating and Optical Express was bottom of the pile on 59 per cent. The survey of 5,409 Which? members revealed Costco - usually associated with bulk food and drink purchases - provided value for money and a good service despite budget surroundings . ‘The top-scoring stores are all about convenient appointments, punctuality, great products and value for money,’ said Which?, adding that Costco showed ‘great opticians don’t always need a glitzy shop front’. One customer who took part in the survey concluded: ‘I found Costco offers very high quality lenses and a wide selection of frames at much cheaper prices than the high street.’ An undercover Which? researcher who went to Costco was taken to a consulting room in a portable building for an eye test by a ‘friendly guy in jeans’. He said there was ‘no hard sell’ and that he did not mind the ‘budget feel and relatively limited choice’ – concluding that he would come again. Overall, the customers surveyed put a higher emphasis on good service rather than cheap special deals. Summarising the feedback, the report stated: ‘You felt that independents were poor for special offers and only average for price, but they offered good value for money overall.’ One customer of an independent said: ‘Good-quality eye care is more important than a special offer.’","Store has beaten leading chains in optician customer satisfaction survey .

"By . Peter Rugg . A photo of a child strapped to his napping mat at a Texas daycare has sparked a state investigation into the school's practices. The image of an unidentified child at Heart2Heart Montessori Academy in Willow Park showed the boy secured to the mat with two strips of duct tape over his blanket, with one at the feet and the other over his shoulders. The picture was taken by a now-former employee of the school. This image of a child strapped down at his daycare has sparked an investigation by Texas child services officials . Parent Lorrie Almquist said the image led to a confrontation with academy co-owner Pam Decker on Wednesday. Decker then admitted to her that she'd resorted to similar tactics with Almquist's son, 3, on the same day the picture was taken. 'I was honestly in such shock, I had no words to say to her,' Almquist told KHOU. 'I was immediately angry. Upset.' She immediately removed her son from the school. 'She was very apologetic, and told me it was something that probably shouldn't have been done,' she said. Concerned parents are already taking their children out of the Heart2Heart school after a former employee captured the disturbing image . An e-mail from academy director Ashlea Pena attempted to quash panic among parents. 'Mrs. Decker is devastated by a very foolish decision she made,' she wrote before adding that the child in the image was 'in no way harmed or caused any distress.' Child Protective Services is investigating a complaint of prohibitive punishment naming the school. The academy self-reported the incident. An April CPS inspection found no deficiencies at the academy. A Thursday night meeting to discuss the situation drew several worried parents. 'Obviously, I'm concerned,' said one mom, 'but the meeting went well.' The school immediately self-reported the incident and is cooperating with state investigators . She said despite the image she would let her child stay enrolled. The owner, who has not been named. is allegedly no longer allowed in the school. 'The school has an exemplary performance history, and will work with childcare licensing authorities,' the academy said in a prepared statement.","Child is restrained at the shoulders and feet .

"By . Sally Lee . Lucan Battison was suspended from a New Zealand Catholic school after he refused to cut his long curly hair but he can keep his hairstyle after winning his fight in the high court today . A long-haired New Zealand teenager has landed himself in court after refusing to abide by his school's rules and cut his curly locks. St John's College student Lucan Battison was subsequently suspended by principal Paul Melloy last month. However the suspension was cleared on the basis that the 16-year-old returned with shorter hair. The matter has since been taken to the High Court at Wellington for a judicial review sought after by his father Troy Battison and Lucan has not returned to school. The teenager's lawyer Jol Bates said the year 12 student stood up for his rights and followed the example of humanitarian activist Martin Luther King Jr, the court heard on Monday. Mr Bates added that Lucan isn't comfortable with cutting his curly hair as it would become 'boofy and turned into an afro', reported the New Zealand Herald. Mr Bates said Lucan had been sporting the same hairstyle since he became a student at the Catholic college three years ago. The court was also told that his hair does not pose any health and safety concerns nor was it a distraction to other pupils. After St John's College student (right) was suspended by principal Paul Melloy the matter was taken to the High Court at Wellington for a judicial review. The teenager is pictured with his lawyer Jol Bates (left) on Monday . Lucan, who had his hair tied back at during the hearing, listened to the school's lawyer Richard Harrison as he said a teacher had sent the teenager to Mr Melloy's office as his hair had overgrown its acceptable length. When asked to cut his hair, Lucan refused and asked the principal to contact his father. Mr Harrison described this as 'continual disobedience' and further said this could be 'harmful and dangerous' as this may influence on other pupils who look up to Lucan. Justice David Collins asked Mr Melloy why had not considered other disciplinary action and Mr Harrison said the principal ruled out other measures when Lucan chose to go against the school's policy in the presence of his parents. The case continues. Mr Bates said his client was standing up for his basic human rights, challenging authority and following in the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Casey Kasem's widow has accused his children of making a desperate grab for his life insurance following the DJ's death. Jean Kasem, Casey's second wife, has accused his daughter Kerri of calling his funeral home to ask how quickly a death certificate could be issued so his sizeable policy could be cashed out. However, Kerri has hit back, saying that Jean hasn't had Casey body flown out to L.A. for burial yet because she is trying to deflect attention from an imminent investigation into elderly abuse. Scroll down for video . Battle: Casey's widow Jean (left) has accused his children (daughter Kerri, right) of trying to get their hands on the former DJ's life insurance following his death a week ago . Passed away: Casey died on June 15 - Father's Day - after relatives had already started arguing over his care . Casey died on June 15 - Father's Day -  aged 82 from Parkinson's disease, dementia and sepsis. However Kerri claims Jean took him out of his rest home and moved him around the US at the end of his life to keep him away from family. During the trip he developed a bedsore which contributed to his death. Jean is now arguing that the whole saga is a ploy by his children to get their hands on his money. According to TMZ, Jean said: 'Their impatience for Casey to die was obvious... and now their impatience to collect on the life insurance is even more telling.' Casey's children held a memorial service for him on Saturday, attended by 200 people including his brother, but excluding Jean and her daughter Liberty, who she had with Casey. Last week, Jean put Casey's Beverly Hills mansion, complete with eight bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, tennis courts, and a piece of the Brooklyn bridge, on the market for $42million. According to reports, . Jean will be handling funeral arrangements for the late DJ after his . daughter Kerri agreed to her request to hand over his remains. Kerri . Kasem had been granted custody last month over her father’s medical . care, but that role expired when her father died Father's Day morning. An attorney for Kerri told TMZ that Jean's attorney had reached out to request the body be released to her. The pair didn’t speak directly. According to a recent filing of Casey's health directive he wanted a burial. Jean Casem will act as the executor of Casey's will. Broadcast legend Kasey Casem died aged 82 after a long battle with Parkinson's disease and dementia, his wife Jean (pictured with him at the Emmy Awards in 1988) will now bury him as he had requested . Star: Kasem, pictured next to wife Jean Kasem, received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1981 . His death was announced on social media by his children, Mike, Kerri and Julie Kasem. The message didn't include the name of . his second wife, Jean Kasem, who had been fighting them in in an ugly . court battle over his medical treatment. 'Early this Father’s Day morning, our dad Casey Kasem passed away surrounded by family and friends,' the message read. 'Even though we know he is in a better place and no longer suffering, we are heartbroken. 'Thank you for all your love, support and prayers. The world will miss Casey Kasem, an incredible talent and humanitarian; we will miss our Dad. With love, Kerri, Mike and Julie.' Kasem died in a Washington hospital at 3.23am, spokesman Danny Deraney said in a statement. In 2013, Kasem's children filed a legal petition to gain control of his health care, alleging that Kasem was suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease and that his wife was isolating him from friends and family members. Kasem also suffered from Lewy Body Disease, a form of dementia. Jean has put Casey's Beverly Hills mansion, which features a heart-shaped pool, tennis courts and a golf course, on the market for $42million . Kasey Kasem's widow put his Beverly Hills mansion up for sale for $12million. The 12,000 square foot mansion also has eight bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, and a piece of the Brooklyn bridge . A judge in May temporarily stripped his wife of her caretaker role after she moved him from a medical facility in Los Angeles to a friend's home in Washington state. Jean Kasem said she moved her husband to protect his privacy and to consult with doctors. Casey Kasem developed a severe bedsore while in Washington and was in critical condition by the time he was hospitalized in early June. Kasem's transportation to Washington posed serious risks. 'She disconnected his G-tube, which provided his only source to nutrition and hydration,' Dr. Paul Leitner said in documents obtained by the paper. 'She was informed of the risks of doing so and was told she was placing Mr. Kasem in great bodily harm or possible demise.' Jean Kasem had objected to a Wednesday ruling in a Los Angeles Superior Court that stopped her husband from being given food and drink over concerns it might be painful for him. 'Right now, Casey Kasem's health is declining and (he) won't be with us much longer,' Danny Deraney said in a June 6 statement. Casey hosted American Top 40 radio show, and voiced cartoon characters such as Shaggy from Scooby Doo . Casey Kasem is seen with wife Jean Kasem and his children (from left) Kerri Kasem, Michael Kasem and Julie Kasem . During . temporary conservator Kerri Kasem's visit to see her father on June 1 in . Washington state, Jean Kasem threw meat at her as he was preparing for a . trip to the hospital. 'In . the name of King David, I threw a piece of raw meat into the street in . exchange for my husband to the wild rabid dogs,' she told NBC News. Kasem became famous as the voice of American Top 40, and his career there began on July 4, 1970, in Los Angeles, when the No. 1 song was Three Dog Night's cover of Randy Newman's Mama Told Me Not to Come. The show expanded to hundreds of stations, including Armed Forces Radio, and continued in varying forms - and for varying syndicators - into the 21st century. He stepped down from American Top 40 in 2004 and retired altogether in 2009, completing his musical journey with Shinedown's 'Second Chance.' While many DJs convulsed their listeners with stunts and 'morning zoo' snarkiness, Kasem would read 'long distance dedications' of songs sent in by readers and introduce countdown records with sympathetic background anecdotes about the singers. Early days: Kasem is seen in the DJ booth at WJBK station in Detroit in 1957 . 'The idea . from the beginning was to do the type of thing on radio that Ed Sullivan . did on television, good, honest stories with human interest,' he told . the Los Angeles Times in 1975. Kasem's . legacy reached well beyond music. His voice was heard in TV cartoons . such as 'Scooby-Doo' as the voice of Shaggy and in numerous commercials. 'They . are going to be playing Shaggy and Scooby-Doo for eons and eons,' Kasem . told The New York Times in 2004. 'And they're going to forget Casey . Kasem - unless they happen to step on his star on the Hollywood Walk of . Fame. I'll be one of those guys people say ""Who's that?"" about. And . someone else will say, ""He's just some guy who used to be on the . radio.''' Succeeding Kasem at the main American Top 40 show in 2004 was multi-platform star Ryan Seacrest, who has said he had been a fan of Kasem since boyhood and would imitate him in pretend countdown broadcasts at age 9.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Unions planning a summer of strikes pose a threat to the economy, the Tories warned today as the government prepared for a stand-off over public sector pay. Unison, which has 1.3 million members, voted in favour of industrial action on July 10, boasting it could be the biggest walkout since the 1926 General Strike. A number of trade unions are seeking to mobilise their members to cause disruption this summer, with teachers, firefighters, tax officials, civil servants, railway workers and midwives considering industrial action. Public sector workers say their pay has been unfairly squeezed by spending cuts, but the government insists difficult decisions were needed to tackle the nation's debts . Unison today announced that its local government members backed action by 58 per cent in protest at a pay offer worth 1 per cent for most workers. General secretary Dave Prentis, said: ‘We expect to be joined in that action by other unions in local government and will be campaigning amongst our members for maximum support on that day. ‘Many of our members are low paid women earning barely above the minimum wage, who care for our children, our elderly and our vulnerable and they deserve better treatment than they have had at the hands of this government. ‘The employers must get back into talks immediately to avoid a damaging dispute.’ Unison said local government workers have been 'condemned' to three consecutive years of pay freezes, followed by below-inflation rises in 2013 and 2014, leaving their pay reduced by almost 20 per cent since the coalition came to power. But Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps told MailOnline: 'This strike is wrong. It will hurt hardworking people and families right across the country. 'The Government has had to take difficult decisions following Labour’s Great Recession. 'But now that we are starting to see those sacrifices pay off, with a real and steady economic recovery, it is galling that trade union bosses want to put that at risk. 'We haven’t heard a peep from Ed Miliband, of course. Ed Miliband is simply too weak to stand up to the trade union bosses who hold Labour’s purse strings – and too weak to represent the British people.' The Local Government Association also condemned the move, adding: 'It is disappointing that Unison will be proceeding with strike action. ‘Local government staff have worked wonders while councils have been tackling the biggest funding cuts in living memory and we have no doubt that many will still be at work on the day of strike action.’ Unison is the first major union to announce strike action this week, with more expected within days. The GMB and Unite will announce voting results over the next week, while the Public and Commercial Services union is also balloting its members for a strike in a long-running dispute over cuts in the civil service, with the result also due by the end of the month. Members of the National Union of Teachers will also take industrial action on July 10, while firefighters in England and Wales have staged a series of walkouts over pensions over the past year and have not ruled out further stoppages. Unison General Secretary Dave Prentis predicts walkouts on July 10 will be the biggest since the 1926 General Strike, but Tory party chairman Grant Shapps condemned the action for threatening the economic recovery . Midwives in England could soon be balloted for industrial action in protest at the Government's controversial decision not to accept a recommended 1 per cent across the board pay rise for NHS staff. Thousands of midwives and maternity support staff are currently being consulted on whether they want a formal ballot for action. Jon Skewes, director of policy and employment relations at the Royal College of Midwives, said: ‘Midwives are really angry that the Government said to them they'd get a 1% pay rise but now only staff at the top of their pay scales will get that rise, and it's not consolidated into their pay. 'Jeremy Hunt (the Health Secretary) has picked out health workers for harsher treatment on pay than anyone else in the public sector. 'This is the time for midwives to take a stand because the Government is intent on assaulting their pay and conditions.' Other health unions are warning of ballots for industrial action, which could see a second wave of public sector strikes in in the autumn. Civil servants at the Ministry of Justice and tax workers are also expected to take industrial action in the coming days in separate disputes over jobs and privatisation. The Public and Commercial Services union said tens of thousands of HM Revenue and Customs staff across the UK will hold rolling strikes this week, including in Scotland and the North East today, Yorkshire and Humberside and Eastern England tomorrow, London, the South East and South West on Wednesday, Midlands and Northern Ireland on Thursday and North West England and Wales on Friday. Mick Cash, acting general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, also warned of a strike ballot among Network Rail workers in a row over spending cuts. He told the union's annual conference in Bristol: 'We are talking about a ballot across the whole of Network Rail if cuts aren't stopped, a ballot that would include signallers, operations and the maintenance works on the infrastructure. 'We are being driven down that road by cash-led cuts, imposed by the Government, which threaten life and limb at a time of surging rail demand and while the private train companies are robbing the railways blind.’","58% of Unison's local government members back strike action on July 10 .

"By . Corey Charlton . The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance has released a comprehensive tax bulletin defining the everyday sandwich in order to clarify what is subject to sales tax. It includes a broad definition of the sandwich, as well as types of common, and less common, bread-based snacks which it defines as sandwiches. The department released the bulletin to explain what is considered a sandwich in a 'simplified language on a topic of interest to taxpayers'. Bad news for lovers of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches - the snack is subject to sales tax in New York . For those unaware, a sandwich is: 'cold and hot sandwiches of every . kind that are prepared and ready to be eaten, whether made on bread, on . bagels, on rolls, in pitas, in wraps, or otherwise, and regardless of . the filling or number of layers'. 'A sandwich can be as simple as a buttered bagel or roll, or as elaborate as a six-foot, toasted submarine sandwich.' The bulletin reads almost like a shop menu - breaking out into a list of everyday 'common' sandwiches that include the BLT, club sandwiches, and cold cut and grilled cheese sandwiches. And . those hoping to circumvent the tax will be disappointed to hear the . bulletin doesn't dodge sandwiches of the much-loved peanut butter and . jelly variety. It then details a number of other sandwiches that are listed outside of those deemed 'common'. They include bagels, burritos, croissants, flatbread and breakfast sandwiches, and - one which is sure to rankle with the sandwich purists - hamburgers and hotdogs. Sandwiches . are generally subject to sales tax. This bulletin explains what is . considered a sandwich for sales tax purposes.

"By . Sarah Michael . A young boy engulfed and killed when snow fell off the roof of an apartment his family was holidaying in, was building a snowman just minutes before his death. Police told 3AW radio the seven-year-old boy, from Roxburgh Park in north Melbourne, was on holiday with his parents and two siblings and was playing outside with his family when he went missing at about 5pm on Wednesday. While his parents searched desperately to find him, the young boy was later found still in an upright position after he reportedly walked away for a few seconds when snow from the two-storey building fell and covered him, reported The Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . A seven-year-old was found unconscious by emergency services near a ski chalet on Mt Buller after he disappeared earlier on Wednesday afternoon . His family searched for him for 20 minutes before calling police and the boy was found by ski patrol at about 6.30pm, less than 50m from the lodge where he was staying. Last night, family friend Atif Mirza posted a message online to express his hurt at the loss. He said the young boy named 'Haadi' 'will be missed forever' and remembered for his 'gentle personality'. 'Family is totally devastated, specially mother is going through such a pain which is hard to describe,' he posted, according to The Telegraph. He also said the young boy was not on the roof when the accident happened and called it a 'tragic accident and n one's fault'. 'RIP Haadi, we will moss you forever.' Senior Constable Melissa Seach said the boy was found on The Avenue in Mt Buller. 'He was found unconscious covered in snow,' she told MailOnline. The boy died after reportedly suffocating when a large amount of snow fell from a roof onto him. Pictured is Mount Buller . The local Country Fire Authority, resort staff, ski patrollers and up to 20 police spent 90 minutes looking for the buried boy before finding him unconscious. Ambulance Victoria spokesman Paul Bentley said the boy was treated by paramedics and staff at Mt Buller Medical Centre. 'He was treated for over an hour but couldn't be revived,' Mr Bentley said. After being taken to the centre, the young boy fell into cardiac arrest and later died despite doctors' attempts to revive him for more than an hour, The Telegraph reported. Acting Segeant Matt Bennett said he believed the young boy had been playing in the snow near the apartment for about 10 minutes. 'He's become separated frin his two siblings at some point, and they were unaware if him wandering off, or his location. (The parents) were very distraught,' he said. Police used a line search with snow probes, similar to how they would after an avalanche, to locate the boy's body. Mt Buller Resort has urged visitors to take care and will review its safety operation and procedures. The boy's disappearance is not believed to be suspicious and police are not investigating foul play. Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Peter Blake said Mt Buller had very poor conditions at the time the boy went missing. 'It was hard to see anything, it was almost white out conditions,' Mr Blake said. 'Temperatures were sitting around the zero degree mark… and it would feel a lot colder than that as well.' Victoria Police will prepare a report for the coroner.","Child was found unconscious around 6.30pm near a ski chalet on Mt Buller .

"By . Wills Robinson . Serial rapist: Christopher Hubbart, 63, will be moving in next to Sharon Duvernay after being released from a psychiatric . A woman who was snatched from her garden and raped by her neighbour when she was just three years old has been left 'terrified' by news a sex offender will be moving in next door. Nearly 60 years after the terrifying attack, retired school teacher Sharon Duvernay, now 62, will be living in the same neighbourhood as the 'Pillowcase Rapist,' - a vile criminal responsible for at least 40 attacks in the 1970s and 1980s. Christopher Hubbart, 63, will be released from a psychiatric facility in California before moving to a home in the rural, isolated community of Lake Los Angeles, according to Fox News. He will live in a small, one-story house and will be the closest resident to Mrs Duvernay, who lives on five acres of land. Fearing she could become the victim of another traumatic attack, she said she is going to buy guard dogs and upgrade her security system. Her other neighbours are also considering putting up barbed-wire fences and better lights. While the local police department have pledged to do all they can to ensure safety, residents are daunted by the rapist's imminent. Hubbart earned his grim nickname for the vile method of his crimes. He would bind victims' hands before pulling pillowcases over their heads to silence their screams. The move has brought back memories to Mrs Duvernay of when she was raped in 1955 outside her New Orleans family home. She said: 'The pain never goes away. I don't think about it everyday but certainly with him coming I do...I'm terrified. 'It's just so ironic. His patterns are exactly like the guy who attacked me. We tried to do everything within the law to keep him from moving here. 'We collected more than 12,000 letters to the judge.' Mrs Duvernay also believes her daily routine will become more difficult, as she will need to be on high alert while carrying out chores, such as taking out the trash. Hubbart has been in a mental health facility since 1996. Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey petitioned the state Supreme Court in July 2013 to block his release, but the court denied her request, prompting widespread protests from residents.

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Consumer groups and an MP are demanding a police inquiry into Wonga after evidence emerged it sent bullying letters from fake law firms to threaten customers who were behind on repayments. Britain’s biggest payday lender was yesterday named and shamed by a City watchdog, which ordered it to pay more than £2.6million in compensation to 45,000 customers who received the bogus letters. But consumer groups say there is clear evidence of a criminal deception and insist the police should be brought in. Wonga has been slammed for pressurising indebted to customers  by sending letters from fake law firms . Wonga could be investigated for a string of criminal offences, from fraud to falsely impersonating a solicitor and even blackmail, says lawyer Dan Bunting. It is a crime under the Fraud Act to dishonestly make a false representation, intending to make a gain or cause a loss to another, when you know it is false and misleading. The Solicitors Act of 1974 makes it an offence for someone to falsely claim to be a solicitor –  although there is usually a six month time limit from the date of this particular offence. Wonga could also be charged with blackmail under section 21 of the Theft Act 1968 – as a threat to take people to court could be regarded as ‘an unwarranted demand with menaces’. Mr Bunting said: ‘So, whilst “blackmail” conjures up connotations of masked men making a ransom demand after a kidnapping, this may well be close.’ Shadow consumer affairs minister Stella . Creasy called for a police investigation of Wonga saying: ‘Aside from . potential fraud, harassment of a debtor is a criminal offence.’ The MP pointed out that it is also an offence to pretend to be a lawyer under the 1974 Solicitors Act. She . added: ‘News that Wonga was sending fake solicitor letters to . cash-strapped customers who couldn’t afford their fees to frighten them – . and charging them for these – is further proof of the need for Britain . to rid itself of these legal loan sharks.’ While the company . presents itself as the ethical face of the payday loans industry with . its friendly TV ad puppets, an investigation by the Financial Conduct . Authority found extensive evidence of ‘thuggish’ behaviour. Among . Wonga’s victims threatened by the fake legal team was a woman who missed . repayments because she was in hospital recovering from a miscarriage. The . FCA said Wonga sent letters to customers in arrears from what appeared . to be two law firms, called ‘Chainey, D’Amato & Shannon’ and ‘Barker . and Lowe Legal Recoveries’ – but these two companies were invented by . Wonga to put pressure on customers. In some cases extra charges were added to the outstanding debt to cover the cost of sending these threatening letters. Despite . the damning evidence, the watchdog added that £2.6million is the . biggest compensation order it can impose on Wonga – because the . wrongdoing occurred before tougher laws were implemented last year. Consumer . Action Group founder Marc Gander said: ‘It seems to me that this was a . criminal deception. Wonga was inventing lawyers and making demands for . charges. I am amazed that there is no substantial fine or criminal . investigation. ‘I don’t think the FCA needs to look very far to find . evidence of laws that have been broken, the real problem is that they do . not seem to have the will or the courage.’ Clive Adamson, director . of supervision at the FCA, said: ‘Wonga’s misconduct was very serious . because it had the effect of exacerbating an already difficult situation . for customers in arrears. ‘The FCA expects firms to pay particular . attention to fair treatment of those who have difficulty in meeting . their loan repayments.’ The £2.6million of redress covers a flat . compensation payout of £50 for each of the 45,000 customers who were . targeted between 2008 and 2010. Some will also get refunds of charges . that were unfairly applied. Payday loan adverts are mostly aired on day-time TV, raising fears that the unemployed are being targeted . Payday firms boomed during the recession, as desperate families turned to high-interest loans to get by . However, this represents a tiny figure in . the context of the company’s profits, which are estimated at more than . £100million a year on the back of making more than four million loans a . year to more than one million customers. One of the company’s two . founders, Errol Damelin, who was chief executive at the time the . threatening letters were being sent, stepped down from his post as . chairman just two weeks ago in what appears to have been a damage . limitation exercise. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com . joined in the attack: ‘This just shows that while Wonga hires expensive . marketing, PR and public affairs consultants to try to position itself . as the good guys in a bad industry, it’s all a sham. ‘Using lawyers . as fake as its puppets, then having the stomach to charge people for it . is a thuggish tactic, aimed at scaring and intimidating people already . struggling.’ The firm’s interim chief executive, Tim Weller, said: . ‘We would like to apologise unreservedly to anyone affected by the . historical debt collection activity and for any distress caused as a . result. 'The practice was unacceptable and we voluntarily ceased it . nearly four years ago.’ An order to pay £2.6million in compensation is little more than pocket money to Wonga and its multi-millionaire founders. Errol Damelin and Jonty Hurwitz set up what is now Britain’s biggest payday loan company in 2007 and within two years had raised £14million from City investors. Today, the two enjoy luxury homes and lifestyles with Mr Damelin’s personal fortune estimated at more than £34million, while Mr Hurwitz is said to be over £25million. Their wealth has been built on the back of families who have struggled for cash during a six-year cost-of-living squeeze, during which time the firm has also attracted many critics. Split: Errol Damelin and his ex-wife Julie, pictured left, and software designer Jonty Hurwitz, right . Mr Damelin, 44, originally from South Africa, started his first company in Israel and became an investment banker on arrival in the UK. He was already a wealthy man when his family set up home in a six-bedroom house in Hampstead, North London, in 2002. The house was bought for some £580,000 and is worth at least four times that figure today. As the business grew, Mr Damelin reportedly paid himself more than £1million a year while cosying up to City investors who have ploughed a total of £100million into the loans colossus. While Wonga has been happy to send threatening letters to customers, the businessman has claimed the loans it provides are force for good. He said in 2012: ‘Credit in consumer society is absolutely critical. Without it, you have no social mobility...wealthy people will stay wealthy.’ Despite his financial successes, Mr Damelin has suffered failure in his personal life and it emerged last year that he was splitting from his wife Julie, the mother of their three children, after 15 years of marriage. Like his partner, Jonty Hurwitz, 44, also originates from South Africa. His background was in technology and he is credited with developing the software that assesses customers on the Wonga site, but now he has stepped back from managing Wonga and likes to see himself as an artist and web entrepreneur. He married Chloe Lander, a 41-year-old violinist, in 2001 and five years later bought a £950,000 home on the border of  Surrey and West Sussex in order to pursue a leisurely life as a sculptor. Writing about Wonga, he boasted of having been the ‘thinker, the designer, the visionary’ in the ‘glorious moment’ when the company began trading. His art, he says, is a way to ‘allow my ego to feel fantastic’.","City watchdog slams underhand tactics of Britain's top payday loan firm .

"By . Damien Gayle . A woman is suing her former bosses for not letting her start work later and leave earlier to avoid the rush hour. Andrea DeGerolamo has brought the lawsuit against Fulton Financial alleging it violated New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination by forcing her to drive to work in heavy traffic. The lawsuit claims busy roads worsen her anxiety and depression and that bosses at Fulton failed to meet a request for a reasonable accommodation of her disability. Stressful: Trucks and cars drive down the New Jersey Turnpike. A woman is who is suing her former employer after bosses failed to accommodate her request to start later and leave earlier to avoid the heavy traffic . It puts Camden County's federal court in the bizarre position of having to decide whether traffic jams are not just an inconvenience, but a trigger for mental health problems. The Courier-Post reports that the lawsuit also accuses Fulton Financial of firing Ms DeGerolamo in May 2013 in retaliation for her complaints about its alleged failure to meet her medical needs. Ms DeGerolamo took medical leave from the company in August 2012, court documents say, when she was diagnosed with anxiety and depression aggravated by 'crowded roadways'. So acute was her traffic-induced anxiety, the lawsuit says it 'qualified her as being disabled' and, after her return to work three months later, she asked for a change to her working hours so she could 'come in after morning rush hour and leave prior to evening rush hour'. Andrea DeGerolamo has brought the lawsuit against Fulton Financial alleging it violated New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination by forcing her to drive to work in heavy traffic, which 'aggravated her depression' It is alleged that Fulton Financial only accommodated the request for a short period and then changed her job, downgrading her responsibilities. Ms DeGerolamo was fired in May 2013, shortly after she complained about to the company's ethics review board about her alleged treatment. Attorneys for Fulton Financial have not yet made any comment on the case.","Andrea DeGerolamo says busy roads aggravate her anxiety and depression .

"By . Wills Robinson . A father-of-three who survived the first case of bubonic plague in New York for more than 100 years has died. John Tull, 65, from Santa Fe, New Mexico, was diagnosed with a rare cancer last month and passed away on Wednesday. His wife Lucinda Marker, confirmed his death was not connected to the deadly bacterial infection he contracted 12 years ago. In November 2002, the couple were on vacation in the Big Apple when both came down with flu-like symptoms, including a fever and swollen lymph nodes. Couple: John Tull, who nearly lost his life to the bubonic plague last year, has died at the age of 65 in Santa Fe, New Mexico. His wife Lucinda Marker (pictured) said his death was not related to the plague . They were diagnosed with the plague, a disease that wiped out a third of the European population in the 14th century, an outbreak better known as the Black Death. It was considered New York's first plague case in more than a century, but doctors said Tull and Marker had likely become infected back home in Santa Fe, where dozens of cases have been reported in the last 50 years. While Marker recovered within days, Tull was hospitalised for more than two months. He fell into a coma and both of his feet were amputated. With the case coming in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks, there was speculation that it was the result of bioterrorists or criminals. Marker said she was questioned for days by a 'parade of people' from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FBI and New York City health officials. Dr. Ronald Primas, the New York physician who diagnosed and treated them, remembers the media frenzy surrounding their cases. 'I did like 40 interviews in two days,' he said. Primas said everyone wanted to know if there was evidence the plague was caused by bioterrorist activity or if it would spread. 'Had (John) waited another day, had he gone out into the public with the cough he had, theoretically he could have spread it,' Primas said. About seven plague cases are reported across the U.S. each year, and the disease can be treated with antibiotics, according to the CDC. Worldwide, between 1,000 and 2,000 cases are reported to the World Health Organization, the CDC says. Suffering: Mr Tull is wheeled out of a hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico, 12 years ago after receiving treatment for the bubonic plague. Both of his legs were amputated as a result . Fleas that feed on infected rodents or other mammals typically transmit the plague bacteria. Researchers have said the case of Tull and Marker was pivotal in helping them understand why plague persisted in Santa Fe County, where the couple lived. The plague is endemic in the area, with dozens of cases being reported since 1949. Last year, three people, including an 11-year-old girl and 15-year-old boy were diagnosed with the plague in New Mexico. Despite his hardships, Tull faced everything with humor and a cheerful attitude, Marker said. 'He never stopped loving life — even after he woke up and had his legs amputated,' Marker said. According to the Santa Fe New Mexican, which first reported Tull's death, the couple was writing a book about their experiences. Marker intends to finish it. She said Tull would always advise people to be diligent and not let an illness or the recovery process wear them down. 'He would say, 'You've got to work as hard as you can when you are sick. When they tell you to do something, do it twice as hard,' Marker said. Tull is survived by three children from two previous marriages. Research suggests that the bubonic plague, which used to be associated with squalor, is on the increase in affluent communities in the U.S. As more people move to natural environments where ground squirrels and woodrats live, infection increases. The disease, associated with the medieval period and made famous by historic etchings, similar to the one below of a London town crier in 1665 calling for plague victims to be brought forward, is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis that is spread through flea bites. Wiped out: A town crier is depicted calling 'bring out your dead' in this London street in 1665 . Symptoms usually appear between two and five days after exposure to the bacteria. They include gangrene of the extremities such as toes, fingers, lips and tip of the nose; fever; muscle cramps; seizures; lymph gland swelling. Other potential symptoms include heavy breathing, continuous vomiting of blood, aching limbs and extreme pain, usually caused by the decay of the skin while the person is still alive. Without treatment the plague kills around two thirds of infected humans within four days . About 11 cases of plague a year have occured in the U.S. since 1976. Most of them have been recorded in New Mexico. The most recent major outbreak was in Surat, India in 1994. It resulted in 52 deaths and a large internal migration of about 300,000 residents, .","John Tull, 65, died in Santa Fe, New Mexico, a month after cancer diagnosis .

"By . Wills Robinson . A female manatee was left stranded on a beach in Florida after a mating session tired it out. The animal was discovered on Disappearing Island in Ponce Inlet, Florida, after a herd went back to sea and abandoned her. Rescue teams waited for the manatee to make its own way back into the sea, but it was too exhausted. After a group of tourists gathered to help, it was eventually released back out into the water using a canvas stretcher, around six hours after it washed onto the sand. Exhausted: The manatee was discovered on Disappearing Island in Ponce Inlet, Florida, after it was abandoned by a herd. It took rescuers and tourists six hours to get it back into the sea . Jim Yurecka, the man who found the beached animal, told ABC News he saw a group of manatees in shallow waters on Wednesday morning. After a while, the group went back to the ocean, leaving the female behind. He said: 'I was trying to see if it would go back itself. But it wasn't moving. 'If it was left on shore on low tide at night, it might not make it until the next morning.' FWC spokesman Brandon Basino told the station it took them two hours to reach the scene from their closest office in Jacksonville. They waited for the female manatee to move back to the ocean by itself, Basino said, but it appeared that it was too exhausted to move. Assistance: Tourists gathered to help the animal which was too tired to make its own way back into the water . 'It is quite natural for female manatees to swim to shallow water during mating season,' Georgia Zern, manager at the Marine Science Center told ABC. 'The manatee was only about 30 feet away from the water,' Zern said. 'It just appeared that the female manatee was too tired to go back by itself.' 'The Disappearing Island is a popular spot for tourists, so there were a lot of people nearby, Zern added. 'In the end, about 20 people used a canvas stretcher and lifted it back into the water.'","Large animal was discovered on Disappearing Island in Ponce Inlet, Florida .

The property tycoon's fair locks blew in every direction as the 68-year-old's namesake chopper's propeller sent a huge gust of wind his way. Trump was visiting Turnberry in Ayreshire, one of the world's most iconic golf resorts that he purchased last month and quickly renamed 'Trump Turnberry.' He said he added his name to the resort not for his 'ego' but to make the course 'more successful.' Windy: Donald Trump had some hair trouble as he arrived by helicopter to the his newly acquired Scotland gold course on Wednesday . No toupee: His swirled dyed-blonde mop of hair remained on his head, putting paid to rumors he sports a toupee .

The cost of the purchase has not been revealed but the tycoon said the hotel is debt-free and there is no mortgage on the property. At a press conference in the Turnberry hotel today, Mr Trump said he discussed the name change with 'important people' in Scotland and the world of golf and said he would not have changed it if he thought it would have a negative impact.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Not stable: Doctors have ruled Morgan Geyser, 12 (pictured) incompetent to stand trial in the attempted murder case of a classmate last May . Doctors have found one of two pre-teen girls accused of stabbing a classmate to please a fictional online horror character mentally incompetent to stand trial, attorneys said Wednesday. In reports not made public, a doctor for the state of Wisconsin and another hired by the defense agree that 12-year-old Morgan Geyser is not mentally competent. The results were discussed during a brief court hearing Wednesday, while Geyser sat emotionless, braiding her hair. Geyser and the other stabbing suspect Anissa Weier, also 12, entered the court room separately on Wednesday, both cuffed and wearing blue scrubs. Weier was also composed, hiding her face behind her dark hair, the Journal Sentinel reported. During the proceedings the court also granted the defense's request to test Geyser for mental disease or defect, which could result in a potential insanity plea. A hearing on her mental competency will be held on August 1. Authorities say Geyser and Weier plotted for months to kill their unidentified friend to curry favor with Slender Man, a character in horror stories they read online. They told investigators they believed Slender Man had a mansion in a Wisconsin forest and they planned to go live with him after the slaying. Scroll down for video .

"By . Amanda Williams . Tennis star Serena Williams has posted a photograph of herself curled up under a blanket after being forced to drop out of Wimbledon with a 'virus illness'. The tournament was host to dramatic scenes yesterday as the 32-year-old broke down on court and was forced to withdraw in the middle of her doubles match alongside sister Venus. After emergency court-side medical checks delayed the match by more than 10 minutes, Miss Williams was given the go-ahead to play, but was forced to stop a short time later after serving four consecutive double faults. Thankfully the women's world number one appears to taking things much easier today, posting a photograph on both Twitter and Instagram showing her sleeping on a sofa under a pink blanket.

Court officials talk to Serena Williams of the U.S as she and Venus Williams retire after 3 games from their women's doubles match against Kristina Barrois of Germany and Stefanie Voegele of Switzerland . In scenes that were uncomfortable to watch on Court One, Serena was plainly not herself and her vision looked to be the root of the trouble as she wiped at her eyes . Serena wipes her face as she sits talking to the doctor on court after being taken ill . According to the Guardian, Miss Williams' coach and boyfriend Partrick Mouratoglou said he had not spoken to the 17 times Grand Slam champion 'for a couple of days'. However as she left the grounds of the All England Club last night he was said to be by her side. During the match the younger Williams sister looked dazed, and playing as if she had never before picked up a racket. Her . following serves were all double-faulted – variously sent into the net . and long – and at 0-40 to opponents Kristina Barrois and Stefanie . Voegele umpire Kader Nouni came down off his chair to check on the . 32-year-old’s fitness. During the delay, one of the Williams' other sisters, along with Serena's agent and her hitting partner, left . their seats in the stands. Serena . and Venus walked to the sideline holding hands, and Nouni announced to . the crowd at No. 1 Court: 'Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, Miss . Williams has to retire.'

'You might hit four . double faults in a row but you'd make contact.' Shriver questioned: 'Is this a drama? Is this an act? If you're not well, you need to get help.' At 3-0 behind the Williams sisters, who have won the Wimbledon doubles title five times, decided against taking the match any further. In an emailed statement, Serena said: 'I really wanted to compete, but this bug just got the best of me.' Williams added that she looks forward 'to returning to Wimbledon next year.'

'I'm really proud of her for trying, because we just love playing doubles together.' In . her service game, the star was struggling to bounce the ball and keep . it under any semblance of control, and the first two double faults at . the beginning of her first service game highlighted the difficulties she . was experiencing. She was unable to clear the net at that point. The crowd cheered 'Come on Serena' but a third double followed and, although the 32-year-old had managed to get the ball into the opposite half of the court, her direction was all off.

"By . Richard Spillett . and Chris Greenwood, Crime Reporter . Pc Carol Howard, 34, who was in Diplomatic Protection Group, was subjected to a year of bullying in the Metropolitan Police, who then deleted sections of an internal report on her case, a tribunal found . Deleting internal records of sex and race discrimination was a 'policy' at the Met Police, according to the lawyer of a black firearms officer who was bullied for a year. Pc Carol Howard, 35, was intimidated by a senior officer who spied on her through Facebook after she called in sick, an employment tribunal found this week. The case revealed that a detective sergeant looking into her complaint was told to delete references to discrimination and harassment from an internal report. Ms Howard's lawyer, Kiran Daurka, has now claimed that deleting findings of discrimination . was 'a policy' within the Met Police so that they could avoid having to . investigate their officers. She told the BBC: 'We anticipate that wherever there's findings of discrimination they are being instructed to delete them.' Mayor of London Boris Johnson today said he is . 'dismayed' by the tribunal's findings and has agreed to review previous . complaints within the Met police to see if other reports were altered. Pc Howard was thrust into the spotlight in 2012 when the Met chose her to . be a poster girl for a magazine feature on the 10,000 men and women on . duty during the Olympics. But . a tribunal ruled the elite Diplomatic Protection Group officer was . unfairly treated by her inspector who singled her out from colleagues. When . the Met found out she had brought an employment tribunal, all . references to discrimination and harassment were removed from the . document. The . tribunal found this was done 'not because they were not supported by . evidence in the report, but because the claimant had brought a complaint . of race and sex discrimination in the tribunal'. Ms Daurka,  of law firm Slater & Gordon, called for a . full public inquiry into how the Met handles race discrimination claims. Miss Howard featured in a magazine article on the 10,000 men and women on duty during the 2012 London Olympics but she was the victim of intimidation and spying by a senior office, a tribunal has now found . She branded the judgment a 'damning indictment' of the Met and said its conduct has been 'deplorable'. 'My client was subjected to discriminatory treatment because she is black and because she is a woman,' she said. 'Fifteen . years after the Met was branded ""institutionally racist"" they have . failed in addressing discrimination which pervades the system. The . tribunal ruled that Miss Howard's supervisor, Acting Inspector Dave . Kelly, showed a 'personal hostility or antipathy' towards her and worked . to 'undermine, discredit and belittle her'. It . found that within weeks of becoming her boss he formed the view that . she was 'dishonest' and not up to the standard of her colleagues . 'without any sound basis.' And his 'negative perception' was linked to her race and gender and 'no credible explanation' was provided for singling her out. In . one incident, a police car was sent to her home after she reported in . sick for one day and her Facebook was monitored to check the reason for . her absence. And a request by Pc Howard to move away from the unit to escape her bullying inspector was blocked by him. At . the hearing the Met agreed that the inspector behaved 'unreasonably' but said his actions were down to a lack of experience and his 'robust . and overzealous management style'. 'This case . shows that there needs to be a complete re-write of the Met's equality . procedures and an independent investigation into existing measures . purporting to deal with discrimination complaints. 'That's the only way to protect officers facing similar discrimination in the future.' Pc . Howard is now line for substantial compensation and costs after an . employment tribunal upheld her claims of racial and sexual . discrimination. It said . she was intimidated by the 'aggressive' inspector who 'scolded' her in . front of other senior officers. He repeatedly picked on her as he . monitored her Facebook account, where she posted images of herself in a . bikini. The tribunal also found that the senior officer did not face any misconduct . proceedings even after an internal inquiry found he did discriminate . against Pc Howard. Commenting . on the case, Daphne Romney QC said: 'What is particularly . shocking is the deliberate attempt to cover up internal findings of . discrimination. 'The . outcome of the internal grievance investigation led PC Howard to . believe that the investigating officer did not accept that there had . been either race or sex discrimination, when clearly this was not the . case.' Pc . Howard, who continues to serve with the Met, is one of just two black . women among 700 officers in Diplomatic Protection Group. In its judgment, the tribunal found: 'She was treated the way she was because she was black and because she was a woman.' A . 'remedy' hearing will take place this month to decide what compensation . Miss Howard, who was backed by the Police Federation, should receive. The Met Police have said they are 'disappointed' by the tribunal's findings, which they are now examining . Last night, a Met spokesman said: 'We are disappointed at the tribunal's finding in favour of Pc Howard. 'The . tribunal's decision will now to be given full and careful . consideration. We will review the findings, take legal advice and take . forward any learning or actions as appropriate.' The officer responsible for the bullying and 'detrimental' course of conduct was Acting Inspector Dave Kelly. The . tribunal found he and the Met 'directly discriminated' against Miss . Howard 'on the grounds of sex and race' between January 31 and October . 29, 2012. It . said a number of her complaints of 'victimisation' were 'well-founded.' Miss Howard, of Purley, Surrey, is now seeking compensation for injury . to feelings and aggravated damages. John . Tully, of the Met Police Federation, said: 'While we are pleased that . this judgment recognises that racist and sexist behaviour is . unacceptable and is capable of being challenged, it is of concern that . such issues are still prevalent in the Met, despite the many measures . introduced to address the problem. 'Discrimination . of any kind at any level is not acceptable in the police service and we . must all work together to eradicate this.'","Firearms officer was bullied 'because she is a black woman', tribunal finds .

"By . Leon Watson . A paramedic has dodged a disciplinary hearing after he left a heart attack victim to die in the back of an ambulance when his shift was over. Senior clinician Andrew Orme abandoned ailing pensioner Norma Davies, 63, in May last year. A hearing heard he failed to take adequate observations before leaving and left the pensioner with a technician and a driver who were ill-equipped to help her. She died en route to the hospital. It was the Merseyside paramedic's second major blunder, after he had failed to notice two-year-old Lewis Urmson-Brown had been badly injured in a playground accident in 2008. Senior clinician Andrew Orme (left) left heart attack victim Norma Davies (right), 63, to die in the back the back of an ambulance because his shift was over, the Health Professions Council was told . After just a 15-minute assessment, Orme said the young boy did not need urgent hospital treatment and offered his worried parents little advice. The toddler lost consciousness during the night and died with a blood clot weighing 56 grams. Orme was hauled before the Health Professions Council for misconduct in 2010, but was given just a four-year caution and freed to continue treating patients. However, after the latest incident, Orme has now quit as a paramedic. Orme avoided a second disciplinary hearing this week, choosing instead to remove himself from the register of approved medical professionals and effectively end his own career. HCPC panel chair Helen Carter said a full hearing was not in the public interest, and would risk upsetting relatives of Mrs Davies. 'The balance falls in favour of permitting the voluntary removal, particularly as there is an unequivocal admission of the allegations and it will be known that Mr Orme will no longer be on the paramedic part of the HCPC register and will no longer be able to practise as a paramedic', she said. Ms Carter also noted that parts of the hearing would have been restricted to discuss Orme's health problems. (File picture) Orme failed to take adequate observations before leaving and left the pensioner with a technician and an ambulance driver . The paramedic first landed in trouble six years ago, when two-year-old Lewis Urmson-Brown died after banging his head in a playground in Runcorn, Cheshire. Parents Michelle Urmson and Chris Brown were both arrested on suspicion of murder, but when the injuries were investigated, the attention swung on to Orme. Ms Urmson had noticed a small cut on her son's head and dialled 999 for help, telling the operator Lewis had 'gone floppy'. Orme saw the boy for just 15 minutes at their Runcorn home but missed the injury and failed to advice the couple to check on their son at regular intervals during the night. The disciplinary hearing in 2010 was told by Orme's representative, Ray Carrick, that he was 'a very very valuable asset to the community'. 'This is a good paramedic sitting next to me,' Mr Carrick claimed. Melinka Berridge, for the HPC, had said: 'There's overwhelming evidence that Mr Orme had the competence to perform the task but simply chose not to do so.' The Merseyside paramedic was given a four-year caution to mark the 'serious' failings, but was allowed to continue working without restrictions with the North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust. He admitted a string of failings prior to the latest hearing and wrote to the panel asking to be struck off the register. He admitted failing to provide adequate care to Ms Davies, including failing to perform an ECG, failing to enquire about her past medical history and leaving her with junior staff despite her critical condition. He further admitted leaving the scene before the ambulance had gone to hospital, failing to travel with the patient to hospital and failing to provide an adequate handover to the attending crew. Orme has agreed not to apply to be readmitted to the HCPC register following the voluntary removal of his name from it.","Andrew Orme abandoned Norma Davies, 63, in May last year .

"By . Steve Hopkins . A springer spaniel survived after leaping 50 feet from an infamous ‘dog suicide’ bridge - with no broken bones. Owner Alice Trevorrow, 50, was walking Cassie across Overtoun Bridge, near Dumbarton, when her pet suddenly jumped over a parapet onto the stony ground below. Mrs Trevorrow and her son Thomas, 24, peered over the bridge fearing the worst but were shocked to see three-year-old Cassie struggle to her feet. This is the spot where Cassie the springer spaniel jumped from the 50ft high Overtoun Bridge, near Dumbarton, which has been dubbed the 'dog suicide bridge' Mrs Trevorrow, a staff nurse, said: 'I will never forget the awful whine she made as she leapt. 'My heart just dropped. I have no idea how she survived, the bridge is so high. I was almost certain that she had died. Mrs Trevorrow said Cassie raced over to the bridge as soon she got out of their car and looked left as though she had seen something. Cassie then jumped off, something Mrs Trevorrow said was 'so uncharacteristic, she has never done anything like that before'. Alice Trevorrow said she will never forget the 'awful whine' Cassie made after leaping off the bridge . Cassie only suffered a pulled muscle in her leg, something Mrs Trevorrow said was a 'complete miracle' She added: 'My son looked down and all he could see was a dot. She managed to get herself up and met my son, collapsing when she saw him. 'Luckily she didn’t have any serious injuries, just a pulled muscle in one of her back legs. It is a complete miracle.' Only one other dog has been known to survive falling from the 19th century bridge which is higher than a four-storey building. The landmark has been dubbed the 'dog suicide bridge' as it is believed between 50 and 100 dogs have jumped to their deaths from it in the last five decades. Mrs Trevorrow was unaware of the bridge's eerie history before she walked Cassie there and is now campaigning for warning signs to be put up to warn other dog owners . The unexplained phenomenon has prompting the Scottish SPCA to send an animal habitat expert to investigate why dogs are jumping off. It is believed that the odour from male minks could be luring the dogs to their deaths. While some simply believe the bridge is haunted. Professor Peter Neville from the department of animal sciences at Ohio University said it was 'highly unlikely' that the dogs were deliberately jumping to their deaths. He said dogs live in the present, so 'are unable to contemplate the future and how they will be feeling', and make plans accordingly. Professor Neville said: 'Of course dogs do get depressed, but this would not lead them to taking their own life.' Mrs Trevorrow said she was not aware of the bridge's history, and had no concerns when she walked Cassie three three weeks ago. 'I had never heard of this happening before even though I’ve lived here for 25 years. But now I know all about the stories. I’m quite a spiritual person and I believe that Cassie was protected that day. 'How else do you explain how she escaped with no broken bones, not even a fracture. She should have a shattered pelvis after falling from that height.' The Dumbarton mum-of-two is now campaigning to have a sign erected to warn other dog walkers. She has contacted MSP Jackie Baillie who intends to lobby the council. Ms Baillie said: 'This is not the first time this has happened. I have heard many heart-breaking stories about dog owners who have lost their pets due to this unexplained phenomenon.' In the last 50 years it between 50-100 dogs have lept to their deaths from the bridge seen below . Only two dogs are believed to have survived the four-storey fall. During one six month period in 2005, five dogs jumped to their deaths. All of the deaths occurred at the same spot on the bridge. Almost all have occurred on clear, sunny days. The dogs involved were all long-nosed breeds: Labradors, collies and retrievers. It has long been thought the bridge, and nearby Overtoun House are haunted. In Celtic mythology, Overtoun is known as 'the thin place' - an area in which heaven and earth are reputed to be close. In 1994, local man Kevin Moy threw his baby son to his death from the bridge. Shortly after he unsuccessfully tried to end his own life by jumping from it. Professor Peter Neville said it was 'highly unlikely' the dogs were trying to kill themselves. Dorren Graham, of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, calls the dog jumping phenomenon a 'heartbreaking mystery'. It is thought odour from male minks could be luring the dogs to their deaths.

"By . Helen Pow . The parents of an 11-year-old autistic boy have been arrested after the child was found living in a cage in the family's California home. Anaheim child protective services and police were dispatched Tuesday night to the home in the 1300 block of Garrett Street after receiving a tip that a boy was being kept in a large dog kennel, police Lt. Bob Dunn said. When officers went inside, they found the cage with a mattress and bedding in it. The boy's severe autism means he cannot communicate and often has violent outbursts, which have grown more violent over the years, Dunn said. It is . believed the parents, Loi Vu, 40, and Tracy Le, 35, kept him in the cage . to protect themselves and their two younger children. Scroll down for video . Arrested: The parents, Loi Vu, 40, left, and Tracy Le, 35, right, of an 11-year-old autistic boy have been arrested after the child was found living in a cage in the family's California home . Cage: Crime scene investigator and a detective carry a cage from a residence in Anaheim. An 11-year-old autistic boy who police suspect was kept in a cage has been removed from the home, and his parents have been arrested . The . cage was big enough that the boy was not forced into an 'unnatural . position,' Dunn said, adding that there were no other signs of potential . abuse. The boy was well nourished and had no visible injuries, he said. Regardless, the child was taken to a local hospital for a check up. The parents have been booked on suspicion of felony child endangerment and false imprisonment. Their son and his siblings are now in CPS custody. Investigators will interview other . relatives who live in the home, and a second family that rents a . bedroom. They will also speak to neighbors. The parents are of Vietnamese decent and do not speak English, so police will need to use a translator to interview them. Scene: Anaheim child protective services and police were dispatched Tuesday night to the home in the 1300 block of Garrett Street after receiving a tip that a boy was being kept in a large dog kennel, police Lt. Bob Dunn said . The discovery comes after a father whose wife allegedly tried to kill their autistic daughter called for more support for families with children who have the condition. Matt Stapleton, from Elberta, Michigan, said that raising their 15-year-old, Issy, is hard and has brought their family to 'cracking point,' primarily because of her violent attacks. 'We need more research, more support and more therapies to help families manage both the challenges of autism and their own stress,' he told People magazine's latest issue. However, he condemned his wife Kelli Stapleton's attempt to kill the girl and herself. 'Kelli did something unspeakable,' he said. 'I still love her but I'll never forgive her.' Mrs Stapleton told police that after years of physical abuse from Issy directed at her and her other children, she 'thought this would be the best solution... if Issy and her went to heaven.' 'This is not an okay act for any parent of an autistic child,' Mr Stapleton told People. Kelli Stapleton faces a maximum life sentence for attempted murder, with her trial beginning July 16.","Child protective services and police in Anaheim, California, were dispatched Tuesday night to the boy's home after receiving a tip that he was being kept in a large dog kennel .

"By . Sally Lee . Stunning images have emerged of a rare sight at Uluru, one of Australia's most iconic natural wonders in the southern part of the Northern Territory, when it was covered with innumerable streams of water. The large sandstone formation, also known as Ayers Rock which is located in the heart of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, is one of the most recognisable ancient landmarks of the country and stands 348 meters-high, spans 3.6km and is 1.9km wide. The World Heritage listed site experiences heavy rains between November and March. A spokeswoman for Parks Australia, who manage the Aboriginal heritage, said they received about 300mm of rainfall a year. She said the last rainfall was on May 26. It is estimated that about 1 per cent of visitors to Uluru get the chance to see waterfalls cascading off the rock. Innumerable streams of water covered Uluru in Alice Springs, the southern part of Australia's Northern Territory, after some heavy rainfall . A spokeswoman for Parks Australia, who manage the site, said it's estimated that only one per cent of visitors to Uluru in Alice Springs get the chance to witness waterfalls flowing from the rock . Uluru is one of Australia's most recognisable natural landmarks. It stands about 348m high, spans 3.6km and is 1.9km wide . The World Heritage listed landscape is one of Australia's most iconic symbols of the outback. It is located in the heart of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park in Australia's Red Centre . The large sandstone rock formation was named Ayers Rock in 1873 in honour of the then Chief Secretary of South Australia, Sir Henry Ayers . In 1993, a dual naming policy was adopted that allowed official names that consist of both the traditional Aboriginal name and the English name. It was then renamed Ayers Rock/Uluru and became the first official dual-named feature in the Northern Territory . The order of the dual names was officially reversed to Uluru/Ayers Rock in November 2002 after a request from the Regional Tourism Association in Alice Springs . The Uluru Base Walk is a 10km walk on a flat marked dirt path and can be completed in around 3.5 hours . Anangu own all of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. The site is leased to Parks Australia and is jointly managed as a national park. This arrangement first came into place in October 1985 . Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park is one of the few properties in the world to be dual-listed by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) for its outstanding natural  and cultural values . The Australian government returned ownership of Uluru to the local Pitjantjatjara Aborigine on October 1985 . The traditional owners of Uluru-Kata Tjuta are the Anangu Aboriginal people . Rock art can be found in the caves.

"By . Steph Cockroft . The husband of an elderly stroke patient says he plans to take legal action as far as the European Court of Human Rights so that he can care for his wife, instead of her being sent to a care home. Edith McDermott, 77, has been treated at the Royal Blackburn Hospital since suffering a stroke last September, when she lost the use of her left arm and leg. Her husband Richard, to whom she has been married for 58 years, has been determined to nurse his wife at their home in Blackburn, Lancashire. Richard McDermott, 82, says he will take legal action to stop his 77-year-old wife Edith being moved to a care home, instead of being looked after by him at their home in Blackburn, Lancashire . Until last week, he believed she would be returning home and he even went on a course to ensure he had the correct qualifications to care for his wife. But the 82-year-old has been told by medical staff that Mrs McDermott - who can no longer sit up on her own and has to be fed through a tube - needs 24-hour care by qualified staff at a care home. Now Mr McDermott says he plans to fight the case 'tooth and nail' so he can care for his wife - even if it ends up at the highest European court. The former airman and BAE engineer said: 'I will fight to the end. If I have to go to the European Court of Human Rights, I will do it. 'I will fight tooth and nail. I will go to Strasbourg, I’m not worried.' Mrs McDermott, who has three sons with her husband, was in good health until she fell ill last year. She started suffering pins and needles in her arm while shopping at Asda and was taken to hospital for a scan. She later suffered a stroke. Mr McDermott said: 'She has not moved out of that ward since she went in there. If anything, she is deteriorating. 'It’s pathetic to stand by the bed and look at her. I have had to take her rings off in case they are stolen and she has no dentures in. 'She looks a first class mess and I’m not too big to say so. She has been lying in a bed staring at a ceiling for ten months.' Mrs McDermott, pictured here with her husband, has been hospitalised . since suffering a stroke in September last year. Medics now say she . needs to move to a care home to have 24-hour care by qualified staff . Mr McDermott said he has held several meetings with nurses, consultants and social services at the hospital about his wife's future care. He said: 'The tone of the meetings seemed to change from her going home to her going in a nursing home. 'I made it clear every time they brought it up that it’s my wife’s wish to go home. This went on until six weeks ago. 'I went for another meeting and the district nurse came down. She arranged to see me at the house and said we will have her home for the Wednesday. 'I was over the moon. Things were going right at last. Then I get a call the day before asking if I would go for a meeting at the hospital. 'I will fight to the end. If I have to go to the European Court of Human Rights, I will do it' Richard McDermott . 'The family doctor was there, insisting she goes to a nursing home. Now they say they want fully qualified nurses and she needs 24 hour care. They are trying to say she does not have the mental capacity to make that decision herself.' Mr McDermott said medical equipment, such as a specialist bed, had been delivered to his home and set up in the corner alongside a television, ready for his wife’s arrival. He also said he had been on a training course to use the PEG Feeding System his wife uses, and said she is no longer ‘being treated for anything to do with the stroke’ in hospital. He added: 'The physios say she is unsafe in a wheelchair. I don’t believe them. I want a second opinion. The ward nurse said she will be in that condition until the day she passes.' Mr McDermott met his wife when he was in a Manchester bar in the 1950s. He said: 'This young whippersnapper came up to me and said, ‘do you not speak to anybody?' We got talking, and now we’ve been married for 58 years. We are two complete opposites, and that’s a good thing.' Chris Pearson, chief nurse at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'We are unable to comment on Mr and Mrs McDermott’s current situation. 'Whilst we deeply sympathise with Mr McDermott, we are keeping him informed every step of the way.' A spokeswoman for Blackburn with Darwen Council said social services had not been involved in the dispute, and declined to comment.","Edith McDermott has been hospitalised since having a stroke in September .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A South Carolina couple is suing the hotel where they say their wedding was ruined by a depraved man who stood above the ceremony flashing his genitalia. Anna Rogers Murphy, along with her parents Clay and Carol, want City Market Hotels to pay up for the ruined nuptials at a Charleston DoubleTree Inn. Not named as a defendant in the suit is Samuel James Dengal, the young Pennsylvania man who authorities say pressed his genitals against his hotel window after waving to guests and the bride and groom. Ruined wedding: Anna Rogers Murphy (right) says her March 2013 wedding was ruined by a man who flashed the guests his genitals from a hotel window. Now she and her parents want the hotel to pay . Flasher: Samuel James Dengel was arrested for indecent exposure after the lewd act at a DoubleTree hotel in Charleston, South Carolina. He is not named as a defendant . 'Before the agreement was signed, defendant LLC assured plaintiffs that the courtyard would be an appropriate location for the wedding ceremony,' reads the complaint obtained by Courthouse News. According to the complaint, the bride-to-be and her parents were concerned about intrusive hotel guests from the start. They were assured by management 'that the ceremony would not be disrupted by hotel guests not in attendance,' court documents claim. The family then paid the hotel $15,000, reassured that the event would be safe from any unwanted guests. It was anything but. The mother-of-the-bride would later tell officers that she saw a naked man in the window of a hotel room overlooking the courtyard at the DoubleTree where the wedding party had gathered. Officers said when they went to Dengel's hotel room, he answered the door wearing only a towel. He was in the room with a woman whose identity was not revealed. He has a large tattoo, which he appeared to have been showing off to guests, when he flashed them during the celebration. According to philly.com, it reads: 'By the Power of Truth, I, while living, have Conquered the Universe.' According to the suit, Dengel's act 'was so extreme and outrageous as to exceed all possible bounds of decency and must be regarded as utterly atrocious and intolerable in a civilized community.' The plaintiffs and her parents are seeking actual and punitive damages for negligence and emotional distress. Scene of the crime: Rogers Murphy, seen here at the actual ceremony, is suing City Market Hotel Associates for actual and punitive damages for negligence and emotional distress along with her father Clay (pictured) and mother Carol .

"By . Sara Nathan . Robert F Kennedy Junior is set to be deposed by the estranged husband of his alleged mistress Chelsea Kirwan - just days before he marries actress Cheryl Hines. The twice-married, father-of-two, will marry the Curbed Your Enthusiasm star over the weekend of July 25, sources say. However, just days before, he may be called to court in Connecticut on July 22 by plastic surgeon Laurence Kirwan, who is embroiled in a bitter divorce battle with his wife - and is trying to negotiate more time to see his three children with her. A source told MailOnline; 'Chelsea has learned that Laurence's lawyers are serious about calling Bobby to court later this month. She fears they want to discredit her as a wife and a mom.

Chelsea. MailOnline last week revealed that Cheryl, 48, plans to marry Bobby, 60, despite allegations that he cheated on her for two years with mom-of-four Chelsea, 42. Sources confirm the wedding is 'imminent' and that the ceremony will be held at the Kennedys compound on Hyannis Port, Mass. Close friends and family, including Bobby's mother Ethel Kennedy, 86, will be in attendance.

And she is believed to have accompanied him around the country. Estranged: Surgeon to the stars Laurence Kirwan and his soon to be ex wife Chelsea at a party. Sources close to Prof Kirwan claimed the mother of three of his children had an 'inappropriate' relationship with Robert F Kennedy Jr . A source close to Prof Kirwan, 62, told MailOnline last week that the high-profile surgeon knew of her close friendship with Bobby, saying: ‘He was well aware that his wife and Bobby had a friendship before their split and that they have had ongoing telephone calls.’ It is believed a friendship started well before the Kirwans separated on July 4, 2012 - and a source reveals how Chelsea’s cell phone records show she was speaking to RFK Jr five times a day in August 2012. RFK . Jr began dating Cheryl in 2012, months before . his estranged wife, Mary Richardson, tragically committed suicide in May . 2012 at their Mount Kisco, New York home aged just 52.

"By . Ryan Lipman . A service station attendant has been left shaken after an axe-wielding armed robber held up the same premises twice in five days. When the bandit, dressed in a hoodie and black cap, returned with the weapon for a second time on Wednesday, the worker had only just returned behind the counter after the first robbery. Manager Anne Roa said his employee had been 'quite surprised because the guy came back' to the United Service petrol station on Les Darcy Drive, South Maitland, northwest of Newcastle so soon. Scroll down for video . A man armed with an axed robbed the same service station, located in South Maitland, twice . The employee at the service station was surprised to see the man return for a second robbery . The first hold up happened on Friday, June 27 about 3.30am and the second on Wednesday, July 2 about 2.15am. CCTV footage of the first raid showed the man approach the attendant before pulling the axe from beneath his jumper and lunging at the attendant. He took the drawer of the till before walking out of the store. For the second robbery, the man wore shorts, jumper and a beanie as he waited to be let into the shop. Once inside, he again pulls out his axe and starts waving it at the attendant. He again takes the whole drawer and walks off, before running back at the attendant, who had pressed a button to lock the doors. He then allowed the man to flee. Police have released some images of the offender to help with investigations . The first hold up happened on Friday, June 27 about 3.30am, with the second hold, pictured, taking place on Wednesday July 2 about 2.15am . 'About a year ago, a man tried to hold up the store, but was unable to. He came with a mask so when the staff realised he was a robbery, he didn't get through because they didn't let him into the store,' Ms Rao said. 'This time the man came in as a normal customer. He (the current attendant) didn't see a weapon and the man didn't pull out the axe until he was in the store. 'The second time he didn't recognise him because he was wearing different clothing. Again he came in as a normal customer and pulled out the axe.' The man is of Caucasian appearance, aged in his early 20s, of thin build and wearing dark clothing and a beanie. In the second robbery, the man wears the beanie and the CCTV footage shows him waiting to be let into the the petrol station shop and walking casually to the counter . The offender entered United Service petrol station on Les Darcy Drive in the suburb north west of Newcastle . Central Hunter acting crime manager Mitch Dubojski said while robberies are sometimes committed in the same area in a short period of time, this one was different. 'To have them come back in such a short period of time is very rare - it is very unusual for them to return to the same location and also disturbing,' he said. He said although not injured, the attendant was shaken. 'He was just doing his job and trying ti do the right thing and serve people when he was attacked in his workplace,' he said. Police have urged the public to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 with any information. Despite being left shaken, the service station worker was not injured and has already returned to work .

"By . Kate Lyons . A man who installed CCTV at his best mate's pawnbrokers shop has been sentenced to 12 months in prison after he was caught stealing from the shop - by the same cameras. Robert James Wroe, 39, was sentenced in Maryborough Magistrates Court in Queensland on Monday for breaking into Loans Star Trading Post and stealing $6,300 worth of cash and jewellery on November 17 last year. Wroe installed seven security cameras at the store six years ago for his friend Wayne McKellar, meaning he had the ability to turn them off remotely using his phone. Scroll down for video . Robert Wroe was caught stealing from his mate's pawnbrokers shop on CCTV cameras he installed himself . Last November, while Mr McKellar and his wife Narelle were on holiday in Bali, Wroe turned off the camera that covered the main section of the store and broke into the shop. He opened the front door using the keypad he had installed and then stole $6,300 in cash and jewellery, thinking he was out of view of the security system. He then left the store and put a business card on the screen door, to make it appear on the cameras that were still functioning that he had just arrived at the store, found it locked and decided to leave a business card. Other cameras which didn't cover the main area of the shop were left. When Mr and Mrs McKellar returned to Australia, Mrs McKellar combed through footage in an effort to solve the case. 'My wife went through the cameras for days and days, and bang, she saw something,' Mr McKellar told MailOnline. One of the cameras showed a side door opening minutes before Wroe was captured leaving his business card at the front door. In another shot, Mrs McKellar saw a guitar stand move which was placed near where the jewellery and cash was kept. Robert Wroe turned off some of the cameras inside the store and pretended he was just there to drop off a business card, all while holding $6,300 worth of stolen goods behind his back . Wayne and Narelle McKeller (right and second from right) were robbed by Robert Wroe (right), who was such good friends with the couple that he named his daughter after Narelle . Narelle McKellar (right) spent days combing through CCTV footage to find out what happened on the day of the robbery . Police arrested Wroe after Mr McKellar spotted a blue plastic container from the store on the front seat of Wroe's car. 'The worst thing about it, he's been a great friend and we've been great mates for years, we socialise together, we've done things together,' Mr McKellar said. 'He had a little girl recently and he named his daughter Narelle after my wife. If he had a boy he was going to call it Wayne after me. 'That's what really hurts me more, how such a good friend could do that to you. Wroe has been ordered to pay $6,300 in compensation and will be remanded in jail until November this year. 'I'm going back to the old-fashioned lock and key,' Mr McKeller said.","Robert James Wroe, 39, was sentenced to 12 months after robbing a store .

"By . Chris Pleasance . From concentration camps to starvation and public executions, life inside North Korea is often thought of as a harsh and brutal existence. But as this set of pictures shows, the closed off country can also be picturesque and even beautiful despite the dictatorial regime of leader Kim Jong-Un. The images were taken by Danish photographer Ulrik Pedersen, who spent two weeks travelling around the one-party state last month. Welcome to North Korea: Photographer Ulrik Pedersen has captured the softer side of the isolated nation, including air hostesses from state-owned Air Koryo that met him before his flight in . Just married: This newlywed couple  couple are photographed sitting on the grass near a fountain in Pyongyang, North Korea, just after their big day . The picture project captured the softer side of North Korea, including this couple heading to get married in the capital Pyongyang (left) and these family pictures hanging on the wall of a house in Chilbosan in the country's north . Among the snaps were idyllic-looking shots of farmland and countryside taken as Pedersen passed above it in a plane while on his travels . The series includes shots of flight attendants from Air Koryo, North Korea's national airline, young women relaxing in the Kaeson Youth Park, and a marriage ceremony with the bride in an ornate pink gown. The trip included a chartered plane flight to the north of the country, allowing Pedersen to capture aerial images showcasing the country's natural beauty. But while these pictures may appear to show a softer side to the country, the New York-based photographer is well aware that he was shielded from the true harshness of life under the regime. Despite the tranquil experience, Pedersen said the journey left him convinced that North Korea is actually worse than most people think because they are hiding so much . Pedersen said that, while he was allowed to take more pictures than he originally thought, his travel was extremely restricted and carried out to a set itinerary . Big news: Kim Jong-Un covered the front pages state-owned newspaper The Pyongyang Times after winning an election in which every single vote went to him . One for the photo album: While Pedersen said he was amazed at first at what normal lives the North Koreans were living, he quickly realised it was all a show . Danish photographer Pedersen said he didn't believe any of the stories the tour guides told him, and noticed that fake buildings had been set up to trick him (pictured, jets on a runway in Chilbosan) Pedersen said: 'I was there two weeks, so I went from feeling like going to a zoo - looking at the people and being amazed they have normal lives and go to work - to reaching a point where I wouldn't believe guide's stories about simple things like the number of lakes. 'With the stories, itineraries and fake buildings - built to justify the stories - the only thing you can rely on is just the book you read about the country. 'There is so much which is hidden for foreigners that I actually think the situation is worse that I thought. When you hide that much there must be a lot to hide. 'When you look at the standard itinerary you have to choose it is very very boring: statues, cooperative farms and museums. So the interest is the different layers from what you see to the political and stories you read the country. At first Pedersen was amazed to see people living normal lives - such as these women in a 'youth park' in Pyongyang - but he quickly realised he was being deceived . As well as tranquil countryside Pedersen was allowed to photograph some of the more gritty, urban landscape around the capital Pyongyang . Mist hangs low over blocks of apartment buildings in this shot Pedersen took in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang while being given a guided tour of the country . Ad fad: There are no adverts in North Korea, instead billboards are covered with propaganda posters such as this one urging people to work harder for their country . Not the Shard: This building could almost be mistaken for the Shard in London, but it is in fact the Pyramid Hotel in Pyongyang, North Korea . 'Traveling around North Korea is like if Jesus was still on earth. You go to a place and there is a list of times the leaders have visited, including a small museum with the chair he was sitting on.' The Democratic People's Republic of Korea describes itself as a socialist state but it is widely viewed by the international community as a totalitarian dictatorship, with an elaborate cult of personality operating around the ruling Kim family. Although elections are held every five years, supreme leader Kim Jong-Un was elected to the highest legislative body in March without receiving a single vote against him - and with no-one else on the ballot. Pedersen was required to travel around the country with the mandatory two guides and a driver - and the occasional government official checking up on them. Get to work: Commuters in Pyongyang wait in a long line in order to catch the bus to and from work in the city centre on the country's poor public transport system . On the move: A female train guard waits for a train on North Korea's metro system in front of a mural painted on the far wall . Hard at work: The regime in Pyongyang have previously banned photographers for taking images of people relaxing, but are keen to promote snaps of people at work to promote the country . Working hard or hardly working? A woman in Hamhung's fertiliser factory answers a telephone (left) while yellow smoke billows from the factory chimney (right) He added: 'I was there to take photos but also to try to understand the different lives people have under different regimes and political situations. 'Most people foreigners meet are used to having their pictures taken and are somehow okay with it. 'It is difficult to get in contact with other people so when you do it is mostly how you approach them. With a smile they seem to be interested in communicating with foreigners but guides will often try to stop any contact. 'I was often told not to take photos but talking nicely to the guides and sometimes pushing them a bit I was allowed to take more photos than I expected. 'I was allowed to go on several walks, both in Pyongyang and other cities in North Korea.' Isolated: Pedersen said that with a smile most people in the sparsely populated country are willing to talk, but guides will often stop them from speaking . Glorious leader: This square in Pyongyang is named after the founder of the Kim dynasty, Kim Il-Sung, which was inherited by Kim Jong-Il before being passed to Kim Jong-Un . Seen from above: While Pedersen's photography was restricted while he was on the ground, in the air he was able to capture shots from the window of his plane . Guarded: Pedersen said he was forced to travel around the country with two guides and a driver - and the occasional government official keeping tabs on where he was .","Ulrik Pedersen travelled around North Korea accompanied by two guides, a driver and government officials .

"By . Associated Press . and James Rush . Police have released the frantic 911 call made from the soccer match where referee John Bieniewicz was knocked unconscious after he was punched in the head by a player. The 44-year-old died at a Detroit hospital on Tuesday following the attack on Sunday at a park in Livonia. 'The referee is knocked out. He's not waking up,' a woman who witnessed the attack can be heard telling officers during the emergency call. John Bieniewicz (pictured, right, with his family) died at a Detroit hospital on Tuesday after he was punched while refereeing an adult-league soccer match over the weekend . Mr Bieniewicz (pictured with his family), a dialysis technician at Mott Children's Hospital, lived in the Detroit suburb of Westland with his wife and two sons, ages 13 and 9 . After the assault, the woman says, the assailant and another man ran to a black Jeep Wrangler featuring 'a huge Brazil flag.' 'Oh God. They're peeling out,' the woman tells the dispatcher. Police said the attack at the Mies Park game came after Mr Bieniewicz announced his intention to send the man off during the match. Prosecutors have charged 36-year-old Baseel Abdul-Amir Saad, of Dearborn, with assault with intent to do great bodily harm. Referee Mr Bieniewicz, in yellow, was punched in the head after he indicated he planned to send a player off during Sunday's game . The Wayne County prosecutor's office . said the charges would be reviewed and possibly amended when it had the . necessary documentation. No new charges had been brought as of Wednesday, said Maria Miller, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office. Prosecutors have charged 36-year-old Baseel Abdul-Amir Saad, of Dearborn, with assault with intent to do great bodily harm . County medical examiner's spokeswoman Mary Mazur said an autopsy would take place today at the earliest. Defense lawyer Brian Berry said Saad, an auto mechanic who has been playing soccer for 16 years in the area, is not guilty of the charges and 'wishes to extend his deepest sympathy to the family and friends of John Bieniewicz.' Mr Berry said Saad has two children and supports two stepchildren. 'Just yesterday, when I visited Mr Saad at the Wayne County jail, he stated: ""I just want to go home and hug and kiss my kids,""' Mr Berry said yesterday. Mr Bieniewicz, a dialysis technician at Mott Children's Hospital, lived in the Detroit suburb of Westland with his wife and two sons, ages 13 and 9. He was a soccer enthusiast who refereed games for two decades. Two funds have been set up to help with funeral expenses and for Mr Bieniewicz's family. One, set up by friends, had raised $50,000 as of Wednesday afternoon. The other is through Huntington Bank. Earlier this week Jim Acho, a longtime friend of Mr Bieniewicz, said: 'I speak for all his friends when I say . we are devastated. Crushed. Just a senseless way for a great guy to go . out. He deserved better.' 'His friends love him. He lives life to the fullest. Never has a bad day. Ever,' Mr Acho said. Mr Bieniewicz was doing what he loved on Sunday when he was attacked at Mies Park, Mr Acho said.

"By . Darren Boyle . A young male barista gave a young mother a free coffee after a middle-aged woman complained about her breast feeding in Starbucks. Julia Wykes was out in Ottawa, Canada when she popped into the multi-national coffee shop for a break. When her five-month old son started whinging, she fed him at the counter. As the temperature was 39c, Ms Wykes said she had no intention of covering her young son while feeding him. 'I am not going to suffocate my child to save you from the potential glimpse of side-boob.' Julia Wykes was with her five-month-old son in Starbucks in Ottowa, Canada,  when the middle-aged woman complained that breast feeding in public was 'disgusting' (picture posed by models) As she was feeding her son, a middle-aged woman asked the young man behind the counter to 'deal with' the situation. Since sharing her story with a local parenting group, the story has gone viral on the internet. Speaking to the PhD in Parenting group on Facebook, Ms Wykes said: 'If you're . ever at Starbucks in Trainyards (Ottawa), give them a good tip! This . morning I was nursing my son in Starbucks and a woman very loudly . complained (so she knew I could hear) to the baristas that they should . get me to stop doing that in public as it was disgusting. 'The barista . smiled at her and said he would handle it. I was gearing up for a fight, . but he came over with a free drink for me and said loudly ""And here's a . voucher for a free drink next time you're in here, I am so sorry that . you had to deal with such unpleasantness today."" Coming from an at most . 19- year-old guy!' The young male barista apologised for the woman's offensive comments before giving her a refill and a voucher for a free coffee on a later visit . Ms Wykes later wrote about her experiences on Huffington Post: 'I went to Starbucks with my 5-month-old to grab a coffee. He started to fuss, I sat down to nurse him to calm him, and a middle-aged woman asked a teenage barista to get me to stop breastfeeding, loudly calling it ""disgusting"". 'He took care of it -- by offering me a free refill, a voucher and an apology for the unpleasant experience as the complainer fled the scene. Yes, I'm the woman who shared this positive breastfeeding story with my local parenting group. It went viral in 24 hours.' Ms Wykes said she was astounded by the level of interest her story has attracted. Some of the comments she has received have been supportive, but many, including some from women, have been abusive. She said: 'What shocked me most in all of this is how many of these negative voices came from women.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Three years after a Florida jury found Casey Anthony not guilty of murdering her two-year-old daughter, she has become a prisoner in her own home. During the two-month trial into the death of her daughter, Caylee, whose skeletal remains were found in woodland five months after she disappeared, Anthony became America's most hated woman. In an exclusive interview with lawyer Cheney Mason, who worked on her case, CNN has revealed how despite being cleared of wrongdoing, Anthony is too scared to go outside. Scroll down for video . Bond: Florida lawyer Cheney Mason sits with Casey Anthony during her trial over the death of her two-year-old daughter Caylee . Outrage: Although she was aquitted Anthony rarely leaves her house because of the hatred towards her . Mason, a top Florida lawyer, became involved with Anthony's case in response to local media of her attorney, Jose Baez. During the trial, Mason befriended Anthony and he and the legal team have since become the closest the young woman has to family. Since the trial, Anthony has had no contact with her father, George, who was accused by the defense team of abusing her as a child, and she speaks infrequently with her mother, Cindy. She 'does not have any blood family anymore,' said Mason, who has written a book, Justice in America. His wife, Shirley, said: 'I'm a cross between a friend, a mother, . but not a mother - only someone who is older who has had experience in . the world she has not had.' Tragic: Caylee was reported missing one month after Anthony last claimed to have seen her in 2008 . Gone: Caylee's remains were discovered in woodland close to the family home several months after the little girl went missing . Acquitted: Anthony, pictured in court with Mason, left, was cleared of murder and neglect . On the opening day of her trial, her defense attorney Baez opened his statement by accusing Anthony's father of molesting her. Mr Anthony denied the accusation, which shocked everyone in the courtroom, including Mason. June 15, 2008 Casey Anthony claims this was the last day she saw her two-year-old daughter, Caylee. July 15, 2008 Anthony's mother, Cindy, calls 911 to say she has found out her grandchild has been been missing for one month. In one of three 911 calls, Cindy Anthony said: 'I found my daughter's car today and it smelled like there's been a dead body in the damn car.' July 16, 2008 Anthony claims she had left her child with a babysitter. July 22, 2008 Forensic detectives find a strand of Caylee's hair in the boot of the car, and cadaver dogs indicate a body had been in it. By this point Anthony had been declared a person of interest. October 14, 2008 Anthony is charged with  first-degree murder. Casey was also charged with aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter and providing false information to law enforcement. December 11, 2008 Skeletal remains are found in woodland close to the family home. DNA tests later confirm that it is Caylee. An autopsy could not determine the cause of death, but showed the toddler's head had been wrapped in duct tape from the chin to the nose. May 25, 2011 The trial begins, with a statement from Anthony's defense team that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family pool, and she and her father had panicked and tried to cover it up. July 5, 2011 Anthony is found not guilty of murdering her daughter. Anthony was acquitted by a jury of murder, child abuse and manslaughter of a child. She was convicted for four minor charges relating to giving false information to police. But despite being cleared of killing her child, Anthony is unable to live like a free woman.' 'She has to live constantly on guard. She can't go out in public,' Mason told CNN. 'She hasn't . been freed from her incarceration yet cause she can't go out. She can't . go to a beauty parlor, she can't go shopping to a department store, she . can't go to a restaurant, she can't even go to McDonald's. She can't do . anything,' he said. Anthony is living at an undisclosed location because of continued threats made her against her, and the level of public hatred for the woman. Mason said the trial, which he worked at pro bono, had cost him more than a million dollars in unpaid hours. He had agreed to help with the case after meeting Anthony in police cells, and seeing how scared and frail she was. He praised the young woman's strength later on in the trial, which could have carried the death penalty, when she refused to take part in a plea deal. 'Casey got . very angry about that. She got very angry to hear talk about it. She . didn't want to hear it. 'Casey would fight it 'til her last . breath. She didn't kill her daughter,' he said. Mason said that since the trial Anthony was working hard to have a normal life, and is still upset at losing her daughter. 'I know . she has very strong feelings for what has happened to her. 'I also know . she's very saddened by her loss and she will never forget her daughter . Caylee, ever,' he said.

"By . Rob Waugh . Updated: . 11:52 EST, 1 March 2012 . It is a make-or-break moment for Microsoft that will either propel it back to the forefront of personal computing or see it lag further behind its arch rival Apple. The world's largest software company gave reviewers and the public their first taste of its revolutionary new operating system Windows 8 yesterday. And, no doubt to chairman Bill Gates' enormous relief, the most radical reinvention of Windows since its 1985 launch has been met with glowing reviews. One impressed tech writer gushed: 'This is . the future of computing.' Scroll down for video . Windows 8 features blocks or 'tiles' that can be moved around the screen or tapped to go straight into an application.  The tiles update in real time, so you can see if you have emails, voice messages or Facebook notifications at a glance . Windows' new lock screen, showing numbers of emails and messages: A free trial of the operating system will be available today after an official launch event. There is no official release date yet for the new tablet-friendly operating system . Windows 8 will run on tablets as well . as desktops and laptops - and is a sea-change for Windows that is seen . as a make-or-break opportunity for Microsoft. Tablets and cloud computing have made . Mr Gates' vision of ‘a computer on every desk and in every home’ seem . quaint - Windows 8 aims to adapt the iconic operating system for life in . the mobile world of tablets. Windows 8 will come in two variations . - one that works on desktops and laptops, and a new version for the ARM . microprocessors in tablets, smartphones and other portable devices. There is no set release date, but . it's widely expected to be available in autumn - offering Microsoft . Office free on tablets, which could be a 'killer app' that puts Windows 8 . machines ahead of Apple devices. In both versions, Windows 8 features a . completely new interface, borrowed from what Microsoft calls the . ‘Metro’ style of the current Windows Phone software. The free trial version is available to download here. As with other 'beta' tests, the software will cease to be available when the test period ends, and people will have to pay for the new Windows. Early reactions have been highly positive. Boy Genius Report said, ''We are now entering the post-post-PC . era, and its focus is the PC. A new, smarter, more versatile PC. This is . the future of computing.' Touchscreen compatible - the new operating system will work with tablets and portable devices. There will also be a version for PCs. Fewer windows - instead of 'stacks' of windows, as in previous versions, the OS is built around clean 'tiles' that deliver information to the home screen. Free versions of Word, Excel and Powerpoint - Windows 8 will offer Office free to tablet users. Business-friendly tablets - Windows 8 will work smoothly with Microsoft Exchange email systems, so could be highly popular with business. Apps shared with phones - apps in Windows 8 will be built to work smoothly with phones (such as Nokia's) running Microsoft's Windows Phone OS. Easier passwords - users will be able to unlock PCs with a PIN, or by circling details in a picture. No Start button - instead, users will access a menu from a 'hot corner' in the bottom left of the screen. The version on test is a 'consumer preview' so will be tweaked and polished before release, so reviewers were cautious about making judgements. Wired said, 'Your desktop is dead. The next few years of computing are going to be very interesting to watch unfold. But one thing's for sure: Microsoft is at least one step ahead of Apple in putting the desktop interface to rest.' Tech site Mashable was impressed, but overwhelmed by the sheer number of ways to control the new software, 'In the end, Microsoft isn’t just asking you to get used to a different interface for Windows. It’s asking you to get used to multiple  within the same OS. I’m not sure how many people have the patience for that. Still, Metro is gorgeous enough to keep me looking forward to Windows 8′s final act.' Boy Genius Report was more effusive, 'We are now entering the post-post-PC era, and its focus is the PC. A new, smarter, more versatile PC. This is the future of computing. 'That is not to say Windows 8 is an 'iPad killer' or that media tablets are going away.While their functionality may overlap in a number of areas, light-duty tablets and full-fledged PCs will continue to coexist for some time.' It features blocks or 'tiles' that can be moved around the screen or tapped to go straight into an application. The tiles update in real time, so you can see if you have emails, voice messages or Facebook notifications at a glance. If PC and laptop users do not like the new format, they can revert to the old style with a click of the mouse. The Windows 8 release has to be good, and soon, say industry experts. More . than 90 per cent of the world's PCs still run Windows, but while . Microsoft remains profitable thanks to divisions such as Xbox, sales of . Windows have slowed. Rival . Apple, with its command of the tablet market, has gained. Microsoft's . market capitalisation is now $267 billion, less than half Apple's $535 . billion. ‘Now that the tablet market is being . defined by the iPad and the (Amazon) Kindle, if they come out with a . buggy first version, they won't get a second chance,’ said Michael . Cherry, a former Microsoft engineer who now works at independent . research firm Directions on Microsoft. ‘They can't afford to disappoint . customers.’ The new Windows 8 Consumer Preview is displayed during a presentation at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain . President of Windows and Windows Live Division Steven Sinofsky demonstrates new features of Windows 8 in Barcelona . Microsoft . has not put a timetable on the final release, but Windows unit head . Steven Sinofsky has said new versions of Windows should be no more than . three years apart, which would put a Windows 8 debut around October . 2012. Everybody will be able to download a . test version of Windows 8 that will run on PCs and laptops based on . Intel chips. But they won't get to try out Windows 8 on an ARM tablet . until later this year. A Windows tablet that works . seamlessly with Microsoft's Exchange email system and Office . applications would be a godsend for corporate technology managers, who . have been bending over backward to put their CEO's iPads - ‘executive . jewelry,’ as one analyst puts it - onto their company's email and . security systems. Microsoft's killer punch is Office. After months of silence, Sinofsky . confirmed earlier this month that the world's most popular suite of work . applications, including the newest versions of Word, Excel and . PowerPoint, will come installed on tablets running the ARM version of . Windows. Microsoft will launch an online 'Windows Store' selling apps, in a similar vein to Apple's App Store . The 'tile' interface, where a set of panels bring up 'live' information - showing, for instance, whether there are emails to read, or bring up Facebook posts - is similar to the one found in Windows Phone, and apps will work smoothly across the two . Microsoft executives in Barcelona showed off how users can use their fingertips to swipe in and out of applications, and tilt upright computer screens to a flat position so they can be used as two-person gaming boards or big drawing tablets. A slim laptop had a hinge allowing it to be turned inside out so it could be used as a tablet instead. 'It's beautiful, it's modern, it's fast, it's fluid, said Steven Sinofsky, president of Microsoft's Windows division. 'Windows 8 is a generational change in the windows operating system.' Microsoft is also opening an Internet 'Windows Store' where users can download applications for the operating system. Applications are free for those testing out the beta version, but would include both free and paid versions after the operating system is released. The test version was downloaded by people from more than 70 countries as Microsoft gave its presentation about Windows 8, but the company didn't immediately disclose the number of downloads.","Touchscreen operating system available free to test .

"By . Rob Waugh . It looks like a giant cocktail glass floating through the sky - but this might actually be the future of how we collect solar energy. Nasa has allocated funds for preliminary research into the huge solar panel that would soak up the sun’s rays from high above Earth. The energy would be beamed down to our planet where power stations would pick it up and farm it out to customers. It looks like a cocktail glass floating in space, but the SPS-ALPHA machine might be might actually be the future of how we collect solar energy . Nasa is taking the idea so seriously it has asked one of its former engineers to provide a proof of concept study. John Mankins, who runs California based firm Artemis Innovation Management Solutions, said the SPS-ALPHA, or Solar Power Satellite via Arbitrarily Large PHased Array, could become a reality one day. He claims that it would be much cheaper than some alternatives like a single array that could go around Earth. It would be made up of thousands of thin, curved mirror-like pieces which could move around to ensure that they picked up as much sun as possible. The inside of the SPS-ALPHA would also be lined with photovaltic panels which convert the sun’s energy into microwaves. The system would be made up of thousands of thin, curved mirror-like pieces which could move around to ensure that they picked up as much sun as possible . These microwaves would then be beamed down to Earth out of the bottom end of the ‘cocktail glass’. On the NASA website Mr Mankins writes the project is a ‘a novel, bio-mimetic approach to the challenge of space solar power’. He says: ‘If successful, this project will make possible the construction of huge platforms from tens of thousands of small elements that can deliver remotely and affordably 10s to 1000s of megawatts using wireless power transmission to markets on Earth and missions in space.’ The technology could make it more likely that mankind could build a Dyson sphere. The spherical solar panel would go around the Sun and give us more energy than we ever need, but it is not clear how it could be brought back the 93 million miles to Earth. Turning the solar energy into microwaves and beaming them across space could now provide the answer. NASA’s announcement comes after regulators in California approved a contract with US firm Solaren Corp to supply space based solar power to a company in the US state as early as 2016. A group of Japanese companies and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency also plans to launch a solar space station in 20 years’ time.","Solar energy harvester will beam energy to Earth in form of microwaves .

"By . Steve Doughty . Adopted: Harrow council told the mother than no Muslim adopters were available . A lesbian  couple’s adoption of a Muslim child was put on hold yesterday following demonstrations outside a town hall. The protests and a series of complaints last week  persuaded social services to ‘review’ whether the three-year-old girl should join her new parents. She is at the centre of a public row between the north-west London Somali community of her birth family, who argue that her adoptive parents should share their religious and cultural values, and council chiefs who said the girl ‘isn’t helped if this process drags on’. Education Secretary Michael Gove is currently pressing for adoptions to be carried out more quickly and for racial or cultural barriers – often used to block the process – to be swept aside. However, Tony Blair’s 2002 Adoption Act, which opened the system to same-sex couples, has sometimes led to complaints from the biological relatives of adopted children. The birth mother of the Somali girl in Harrow suffers from mental health problems and is considered unfit to raise her. The girl’s father is believed to be absent from the home and her two older sisters have been taken into state care. Her mother was told that adoptive parents had been chosen and that she could have a final meeting with the three-year-old last Wednesday. But the family and Somali community members objected and 50 people staged a demonstration outside Harrow Civic Centre. Supporters of the mother contacted the Victoria Climbie Foundation, a pressure group set up by the parents of the eight-year-old girl murdered by an aunt and her boyfriend in Haringey in 2000. Mor Dioum, of the organisation, told the Sunday Times: ‘The family wish that their  religious and cultural values are taken into consideration when making such an important decision. They are saying that this is in the best welfare of the child. The family’s issue in this case is not about the  sexual orientation of these  two individuals.’ He added: ‘The Somali community have for the first time come out because they believe this case has a wider importance. We don’t believe any community is beyond reach.’ Protest: Fifty people gathered outside Harrow civic centre (pictured) as a result of the council's decision . A member of the family said that four relatives of the mother were willing to adopt the girl, but that social workers had told the mother that no Muslims had come forward as possible new parents. The adoption was halted after the town hall demonstration and the family have until the end of the week to put forward names of potential adopters among relatives of the girl. Susan Hall, leader of Harrow’s Tory council, said: ‘Clearly there is always an ideal that a child could be matched with parents from a similar background and heritage. But the reality is the  ultimate choice is governed by the kind of adoptive parents who are available. ‘The most important thing is that the child goes to a loving and supportive home and to people we believe … are best suited to look after them.’ Mrs Hall said the need for adoptive parents from different ethnic backgrounds was ‘only going to intensify’, adding: ‘The careful search for the right adoptive parents also has to be matched against the fact that the child isn’t helped if this process drags on.’ In 2012 a couple belonging to Ukip had three foster children taken away. Rotherham council said they had concerns over the party’s immigration policy as the children were not white British. Figures show the number of children adopted from care rose to a 20-year high of almost 4,000 last year. A 28 per cent increase in such adoptions over a two-year period followed the abolition of rules that stated new families must be the same race, religion and culture as the child’s birth parents.

"By . Andrew Levy . With buttons, levers and flashing lights, this looks like a computer control room. It is, however, just the computer. The Harwell Dekatron weighs 2.5 tons, contains 10,000 moving parts and can work without a break for 80 hours a week. So what does it do? It churns out lots  of sums very quickly. In other words, it’s  a calculator. Scroll down for video . The 61-year-old Harwell Dekatron (or the WITCH) computer has clattered back into action after gathering dust for 20 years . Weighing an incredible 2.5 tonnes, it was once voted the world's most durable computer . So called 'hand computers' or human workers who logged information by hand are recorded to have raced against the WITCH, but had to retire after half an hour, exhausted and defeated, while the computer ploughed on . The WITCH (left) weighs as much as around 15,000 iPad minis (right) and had a multiplication time of between five and ten seconds. Modern day computers work in less than a second . When it was built in 1951, this . computer was a marvel of technology. Yet only a couple of decades later, . the same processing power was available in something a little smaller. Pocket-sized, to be accurate. But for its time, the Harwell Dekatron was highly impressive. Capable of calculating sums with great . accuracy 24 hours a day, it was based at the Atomic Energy Research . Establishment in Harwell, Oxfordshire, where it was used for . mathematical modelling.

It was so advanced, it replaced a . highly trained member of staff who had previously been number crunching . on a clunking mechanical hand calculator. The Harwell used dekatrons – . gas-filled counting tubes containing ten cathodes – for memory, similar . to the RAM in modern computers. Paper tape was used for input and . programme storage, and results were fed to a teleprinter or a paper tape . punch. It was a highly industrious addition to the staff – averaging an 80-hour week during one nine-month period from May 1952. It was later given to a college for . training purposes before it was consigned to a museum and eventually . dismantled and put into storage. The Harwell is being  switched on . again today for the first time in a quarter of a century at the National . Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire. And once powered up, it will become the oldest original functioning electronic stored programme computer in the world. The machine has been rebuilt by a team . of volunteers led by museum trustee Kevin Murrell. ‘I first saw the . Harwell Dekatron when I was a teenager in the 1970s,’ he said. ‘It was . on display in the Birmingham Museum of Science and Industry and I was . very fond of it. ‘When that museum closed, it disappeared from public view. ‘But four years ago, quite by chance, I . was looking at some  photos of items in a storage centre and in the . background I noticed the computer’s control panel.’  The Harwell, which . was by then housed at Birmingham Museum’s Collection Centre, had been . dismantled into 50 pieces. But Mr Murrell was determined. He . managed to locate around 99 per cent of the computer, which has 828 . dekatron tubes, 480 relays, 199 lamps and three miles of wire. He and his volunteers spent  three years reconstructing the machine, using original circuit diagrams and photos. The original designers were also tracked down for advice. ‘It is terrific to see it working . again as I remember it so vividly from my teenage years and it is . probably what inspired me to go into a career in computing,’ said Mr . Murrell. ‘To see it in action is to watch the . inner workings of a computer, something that is impossible on the . machines of today. We hope it will now enthuse another generation of . children.’ The computer was built and used at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Harwell, Oxfordshire, from components more commonly found in a British Telephone exchange .

The computer was built and used at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Harwell, Oxfordshire, from components more commonly found in a British Telephone exchange. Experts started building the machine in 1949, and it was in use by April 1951. It used dekatrons for volatile memory, similar to RAM in a modern computer, and paper tape for input and program storage. It was by no means a 'fast computer'. It had a multiplication time of between 5 and 10 seconds, very slow for an electronic computer, even at the time. But the design was noted for its reliability. In the period from May 1952 until February 1953 it averaged 80 hours per week running time. Dr Jack Howlett, Director of the Computer Laboratory at Harwell between 1948 and 1961, said it 'could be left unattended for long periods.' 'I think the record was over one Christmas-New Year holiday when it was all by itself, with miles of input data on punched tape to keep it happy, for at least ten days and was still ticking away when we came back.'

"By . Jennifer Newton . The Argentinian football team has posed with a banner proclaiming the Falkland Islands belong to Argentina before a World Cup warm-up match. Prior to their game against Slovenia in Buenos Aires which they won 2-0, the banner, bearing the slogan 'Las Malvinas son Argentinas', translated into English as 'The Malvinas are Argentinian' was unfurled. The Malvinas is the Spanish name for the South Atlantic territory, which has had British sovereignty since 1833. Scroll down for video . Message: Argentina players held up a banner saying 'The Falklands are Argentine' before their 2-0 friendly win over Slovenia on Saturday . The conflict over the disputed archipelago came to a head in 1982 with the Falklands War, which saw a British taskforce sent to islands after an Argentinian invasion. The war led to the deaths of 255 British military personnel as well as 649 Argentinians. Argentina has long laid claim to sovereignty of the islands and the message displayed by the team seems to show support for the country's claims. Since President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner took power in 2007, there have been repeated diplomatic clashes with Britain over the territory. Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who said earlier this year that her nation was 'forcibly stripped' of the Falklands . Earlier this year, she insisted that her nation was ‘forcibly stripped’ of the Falklands in a ‘blatant exercise of 19th century colonialism.’ In April, Argentina also accused Britain of provocative behaviour by planning to carry out military exercises in the Falkland Islands. Mrs de Kirchner was quoted as saying: 'History shows that colonial enclaves are always recovered.' But despite the claims, people on the islands voted by 1,513 to three in favour of remaining British in a referendum last year, which Prime Minister David Cameron said 'could not have sent a clearer message'. A British taskforce was sent to the Falklands in 1982 after Argentina invaded the British territory . The banner was unfurled before Argentina recorded a 2-0 victory against Slovenia in Buenos Aires . The World Cup kicks off in Brazil on Thursday with Argentina's opening match of the tournament coming against Bosnia and Herzegovina on Sunday. Earlier this month it was revealed that at the height of the Falklands crisis, the British government agonised over whether to demand British teams withdraw from the 1982 World Cup in Spain, amid fears they might have had to play Argentina. England, Scotland and Northern Ireland all qualified for the tournament and papers released by the National Archives at Kew, west London showed that prior to the competition, the government were concerned that playing Argentina would be unacceptable. Spain's Juan Mata who could receive an almost £600,000 bonus if his country lift the World Cup in Brazil . Spanish politicians have reacted with anger after it was revealed the country's national team will receive an almost £600,000 bonus if they win the World Cup in Brazil. Captain Iker Casillas and vice-captain Xavi Hernandez signed the deal with Spain's football federation last week on behalf of the 23 players, which will see them receive 720,000 euros (£585,365) if they lift the trophy. It marks an increase from the 600,000 euros (£487,804) each player received when their country won the 2010 tournament in South Africa. MPs Pablo Martin Pere and Susana Ros of the opposition Socialist party criticised the premium as 'disproportionate' and 'an insult to citizens' given the recent economic crisis. Spain's economy began to crumble in 2008 with the collapse of its bloated property sector and unemployment soared to 26.1% at the close of 2013. MP Laia Ortiz said she would raise the matter of the squad's premium in parliament and lambasted football for being 'another world' where 'there is no crisis'. Each member will receive a payment of 360,000 euros (£292,682) if the team reach the final, and 180,000 euros (£146,341) if they make the semi-finals. But Manchester United and Spain midfielder Juan Mata said such payments were 'sometimes used against us', but that he would be playing 'with the same enthusiasm I had as a child, in a bid to try and win another World Cup, without thinking about all the rest.' The 2014 World Cup winner will be awarded £20.8 million by Fifa, football's governing body, but many say the money should go towards programmes that promote the game at all levels.","Banner unfurled before warm-up match against Slovenia in Buenos Aires .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . In just two days, it will play host to 198 professional cyclists and millions of spectators. But now, a German cyclist has warned Yorkshire's roads could be too narrow for the Tour de France. Marcel Kittel, 26, claimed the winding streets, enclosed by dry stone walls, were 'risky' for riders taking part in the 118-mile first stage of the event. Scroll down for video . Warning: Marcel Kittel, of Germany, has warned Yorkshire's roads could be too narrow for the Tour de France . Narrow: The German favourite claimed the winding streets, enclosed by dry stone walls, were 'risky' for competitors. Above, a particularly 'dangerous' part of the course is Buttertubs Pass in the Yorkshire Dales . He said the roads will likely be made even more dangerous as more than four million spectators line the walls, narrowing the path and potentially leading to accidents. 'There will be lots of spectators... where can they go if there are stone walls? I’m curious as to what is going to happen,' the favourite told Cycling News. 'It’s a fact we’ll be using some very narrow roads. I’m sure for riders’ safety it would be better if they were wider.' Kittel, who made his Tour de France debut in 2012, is one of British cyclist Mark Cavendish's main rivals in the opening stage, with both of them vying to win the green jersey as the fastest sprinter. The opening stage of the Tour de France starts in Leeds on the morning of 5 July and ends in Harrogate (pictured). The sheep will record the footage as the cyclists travel between Ripon and Ripley . Cavendish, from the Isle of Man, has won . 25 Tour stages as the race's most prominent sprinter, but last year, Kittel claimed four wins to the Manxman's two. Cavendish is said to be particularly desperate . to win this year's first stage because it ends with a sprint finish in his . mother's hometown of Harrogate, and would give him the chance to wear the coveted yellow jersey for the first time. Kittel warned parts of the route from Leeds to Harrogate were 'very dangerous' for the peloton, who will be waved off by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry on Saturday. One particularly tricky area in Buttertubs Pass, a high road in the Yorkshire Dales that winds north from Sinstone, near Hawes, towards Thwaite and Muker.

Cavendish has won 25 Tour stages as a sprinter, but last year, Kittel claimed four wins . Here, cyclists could reach up to 60mph, . before turning sharply into a narrow stretch of road enclosed by stone . walls. 'On the descents when you ride through the more lonely roads in the . middle of nowhere they are very narrow and very small with stone walls . on both sides, so [when] a very nervous Tour de France peloton fighting for the . yellow jersey passes by, there can be a very dangerous situation,' said Kittel. Organisers describe the area as featuring 'winding roads' with a 'challenging climb past 20-metre deep limestone potholes called the Buttertubs'. German entrant Marcel Kittel, 26, warned Yorkshire's roads could be too narrow for the Tour de France. He said the winding streets, enclosed by dry stone walls, were 'risky' for riders taking part in the opening stages. The peloton is pictured riding between Aix-en-Provence and Montpellier during last year's event . The stretch is also reportedly Top Gear's Jeremy Clarkson's favourite road in Yorkshire. The opening stage of the Tour de France . begins in Leeds on Saturday, before the second stage commences from York . to Sheffield Sunday. The prestigious event, won last year by Britain's Chris Froome, often includes technically challenging routes, including mountain climbs, narrow streets and cobbled surfaces. Today, a spokesman for Yorkshire's Grand Départ defended the region's roads as testing, but suitable, for the world's best riders. Finish: Cavendish is said to be desperate to win the first stage because it ends with a sprint finish in his mother's hometown of Harrogate (pictured). The second stage commences from York to Sheffield on July 6 . 'They have been designed by the race . organisers to provide a technical challenge as befits the best cycle . race in the world,' he said. The third stage of the event, from Cambridge to London, will take place on Monday. MailOnline has contacted the organisers for comment.","Marcel Kittel, 26, says Yorkshire's roads are too narrow for Tour de France .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press . A group of Stanford University scientists have found a way to make mouse brains completely transparent. The advance was reported online . Wednesday in the journal Nature by Dr. Karl Deisseroth and co-workers at . Stanford. Some other labs are already working to apply the technique . outside the brain, such as in breast cancer biopsies, Deisseroth said. Scroll down for video . Crystal clear: This image provided by Karl Deisseroth's lab shows a combination of photos of an intact adult mouse brain before and after the two-day clarity process . Anatomy: Other labs are already working to apply the technique outside the brain, such as in breast cancer biopsies . Mouse brains are a mainstay of neuroscience research. To create transparent mouse brains, the Deisseroth team had to remove the fat that provides structure but also blocks light. The . first step was to soak the brain in chemicals that would get inside and . form a mesh. Once that mesh was in place to support the tissue, the . scientists washed out the fat. The result: a see-through brain. Specialized . stains can then make selected structures like brain cells visible and . also reveal important chemical data, like the location of particular . proteins. Advancement: The findings were reported online in the journal Nature by Dr Karl Deisseroth and co-workers at Stanford . The stains . can show details of brain circuits and the connections between different . areas, as well as details of individual cells. 'If . the entire mouse brain is transparent, that makes a very large fraction . of neuroscience research much easier,' which in turn makes more . experiments feasible, said Dr R. Clay Reid of the Allen Institute for . Brain Science in Seattle. Dr Reid added: 'This will make a lot of neuroscientists happy.' That's not just a parlor trick. It allows scientists see both anatomical and chemical details in their natural, three-dimensional setting. 'What these guys have done is just stupendous,' said Dr Bernardo Sabatini of Harvard Medical School. 'You can just peer into the brain' and get 'incredible' images, he said. Dr Sabatini said he was eager to try it himself, and so did Arthur Toga at the University of California, Los Angeles, who called it 'extraordinary ... a great advance.' 'It's exactly the technique everyone's been waiting for,' said Terry Sejnowski of the Salk Institute, who reckoned it will speed up brain anatomy research by 10 to 100 times. Deisseroth's team also showed the technique can work on small pieces of human brain tissue that had been stored for years after being removed from the cadaver of a person with autism. They are now trying the technique on a complete human brain. The technique is a basic tool that should apply to a variety of brain research. Watch video here . Progress: Although the new approach can't be used in living animals, it provides more anatomical detail than brain scans like an MRI . It's too soon to know if it might lead to discoveries that could have a benefit for treating diseases like Alzheimer's or schizophrenia. Deisseroth said the goal was to supplement rather than to replace current methods of studying brain anatomy. Although the new approach can't be used in living animals, it provides more anatomical detail than brain scans like an MRI. Scientists can get fine detail by cutting the brain into very thin slices and studying each one, but experts said it's difficult to reconstruct a three-dimensional understanding of anatomy that way. Even a mouse brain, small enough to fit on a coin, takes hundreds of slices to get through. Scientists have been able to make brain tissue transparent before, but experts called the new technique much more useful.","Stanford University study makes rodent's brain completely transparent using various chemicals .

Daniel Butler, 18, and his friend Ryan Stomsnes, 16, were walking along the water in the town of Mulberry when they saw Matthew Pope attacking an alligator in the water. The teens say Pope told them he was wrestling the alligator in an act of vengeance for his dog, which he said had recently been eaten by one of the reptiles. Shocking sight: Daniel Butler, 18, (right) and his friend Ryan Stomsnes, 16, (left) were walking along the water in the town of Mulberry when they saw Matthew Pope attacking an alligator (background) in the water . 'I don't know what was going through his head because I would never even attempt a thing like that,' Butler told WTVT. 'I just can't believe he actually tried to wrestle a gator.' Butler said Pope tried to grab the gator by the snout before it broke free and attacked Pope. 'The gator dragged him under and he was gone for a few seconds. He came up screaming,' Butler said. Even faced with the horrific scene, Stromsnes leaped into action. 'I was just freaking out and jumped in and then grabbed it by its tail, that’s the first thing I saw,' he told WTVT. Heroes: Pope was taken under the water in the waterway pictured before Butler and Stromsnes leaped into action and helped drive the reptile away. They later learned Pope likely had no dog . Butler soon jumped in to help Pope as well. When he touched the alligator's belly, he said it 'freaked out' and swam away. In it's wake, Pope was left with a mangled arm. '[We] called 911. I used this belt as a tourniquet to help stop the bleeding and things like that,' Stromsnes said. As if Pope's reason for attacking the gator weren't strange enough, the teens say it wasn't even true. 'We heard later he probably didn't have a dog. He was just trying to get the gator,' Stromsnes said.","Daniel Butler, 18, and Ryan Stromsnes, 16, stumbled upon 29-year-old Matthew Pope as he wrestled a gator in Mulberry, Florida .

"By . Sara Malm . The core of the Earth is nearly 1,000 degrees hotter than previously thought, making it as fiery as the surface of the sun. Following new experiments, scientists have established that the core temperature is 6,000 C,  much higher than the previous estimate of 5,000. Using X-rays to probe into the behaviour of iron crystals, putting samples of iron under extreme pressure, researchers were able to examine how iron crystals melt and form. Hot stuff: The inner core of the Earth, previously thought to be 5,000 degrees Celsius is in fact 6,000 . Earth's inner-core is a ball of solid iron, about the size of the moon, surrounded by a highly dynamic outer-core consisting mostly of a liquid iron-nickel alloy. Experiments from the early Nineties, measuring the ‘melting curves’ of iron, suggested that the core had a temperature of 5,000. The new tests, using one of the world's most intense sources of X-rays located at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, the research team were able to re-create the same pressure at the core. In order to do this the team used a device called a diamond anvil cell - essentially a tiny sample held between the points of two precision-machined synthetic diamonds. Scorcher: The new estimate puts the core of the Earth at the same temperature as the surface of the sun . Then the scientists used X-ray beams to bounce X-rays off of the nuclei of the iron atoms, also known as ‘diffraction’, to see how the iron crystals behaved. ‘Other people made other measurements and calculations with computers and nothing was in agreement. It was not good for our field that we didn't agree with each other,’ Agnes Dewaele of the French research agency CEA and a co-author of the new research, told BBC News. 'We have to give answers to geophysicists, seismologists, geodynamicists - they need some data to feed their computer models,’ Dr Dewaele said.","New experiment put temperature of Earth's core at 6,000 degrees Celsius .

"By . Steve Nolan . Ancient forest: Logs and stumps can be seen underneath the thawing 37 square mile Mendenhall Glacier in Alaska, with some of the trees still bearing roots and bark . An ancient forest which is thought to have been hidden for at least 1,000 years has been discovered beneath a melting glacier. Logs and stumps can be seen underneath the thawing 37 square mile Mendenhall Glacier in Alaska, with some of the trees still bearing roots and bark. Remnants of the forest have been protruding from the river of ice, which flows into a lake near the city of Juneau for around five decades. But scientists from the nearby University of Alaska Southeast have noticed more tree stumps popping up in the past year. The researchers are particularly excited about the discovery because most of the trees are so well preserved with some still in their upright position. The forest is said to have been shielded from the ice by a tomb of gravel which most likely encased the forest as Initial carbon dating tests suggest that the gravel tomb, which is around 5ft high, may have been formed at least 1,000 years ago. As glaciers develop they often emit summer meltwater streams which produce aprons of gravel. Cathy Connor, a professor at the university, told LiveScience: 'There are a lot of them, and being in a growth position is exciting because we can see the outermost part of the tree and count back to see how old the tree was. 'Mostly, people find chunks of wood helter-skelter, but to see these intact upright is kind of cool.' The trees are thought to be either spruce or hemlock, based on the size of the trunks and existing vegetation in the area. But while the find has excited scientists, locals are concerned about the prospect of glacial melting. They are worried about the threat of rising sea levels and the loss of freshwater sources relied upon for drinking water.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . An Italian geologist has claimed that sightings of Nessie in the dark waters of Loch Ness are the simply result of bubbles caused by geological forces. Dr Luigi Piccardi believes that there is no shy and ancient monster residing in Scotland's most famous Loch. Popular opinion is divided about whether a surviving plesiosaur lives in Loch Ness or whether the modern myth of the monster is the result of a string of elaborate hoaxes. The geologist, from the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche in Florence, said that historical descriptions of the monster often include details of the earth shaking. Dr Piccardi said that historical descriptions of the monster often include details of the earth shaking. He claims that sightings of the monster are linked to bubbles rising from the bottom of the loch caused by seismic activity along the Great Glen fault system, which runs beneath . He claims that sightings of the monster . are linked to bubbles rising from the bottom of the Loch caused by . seismic activity along the Great Glen fault system, which runs beneath. Although people may not associate Scotland with earthquakes, Luigi said that the fault line is 'very large and very active'. The geologist told Italian newspaper, La Repubblica: 'There are various effects on the surface of the water that can be related to the activity of the fault.' Dr Piccardi points to an old biography about Saint Columba, written by Adamnan, that says the monster appeared and disappeared when the earth shook. Written in 690AD, the text describes a story about the saint crossing the River Ness when his disciple is attacked by a monster and is saved when he asks for the protection of god. Many people have noted that the description is very vague and mentions an 'unknown beast' with a loud roar. It does not support any scientific explanation as there are no bubbles or mention of an ancient monster dwelling in the loch itself. One theory about Nessie is that the monster is a surviving plesiosaur. The long-necked reptiles were found all over the world during the Jurassic period. There are believed to have become extinct in the Cretaceous period . The description also does not make any reference to any previous monster sightings, but it is the mention of the earth shaking that interests Dr Piccardi. He said that there were a number of reported sightings of Nessie in the 1930s that coincided with seismic activity along the Great Glen fault line. 'I think it’s an obvious description of what really happened...with increased activity of the fault, in reality people have seen the effects of the earthquakes on the water,' he said. He believes that his theory can be applied to over 3,500 Nessie sightings. Geologists said that there have been earthquakes in the Loch Ness area measuring between 3 and 4 on the Richter scale. The largest earthquakes were recorded in 1816, 1888, 1890 and 1901. Unlike Dr Piccardi, some geologists have said that earthquakes did not coincide with the explosion of Nessie sightings in the1930s. They have also claimed that Scotland's most violent earthquakes were too weak to cause noticeable ripples of the surface of the loch. The Italian geologist has been careful to point out that he believes the value of his hypothesis lies in making geologists aware of the geological origin of some popular myths. He has also claimed that the mystery of the Oracle of Delphi is caused by sulphur gas. There are many theories about the existence of a Loch Ness monster, which have spawned famous images such as the one pictured. One of the most accepted explanations is that the monster is in fact a giant sturgeon, which can grow up to 12 feet long .","Italian geologist Dr Luigi Piccardi says monster sightings often include details such as the earth shaking .

Using a microphone in a mobile, scientists were able to record the hum and whirs made by a computer’s central processing unit (CPU) as secure information was being decrypted. By then identifying the certain parts of information that each of these unique sounds related to, they were able to extract the content of private emails. Using a mobile phone, left, scientists were able to record the hum and whirs made by a computer's CPU, right, as secure information was being decrypted. By identifying the certain parts of information that each of these unique sounds related to, researchers were able to extract the content of private emails . When data is sent over a secure server using what’s called an RSA algorithm, the CPUs . make unique and distinctive sounds known as loops. RSA . algorithms are used to send data over web browsers and emails, for . example, and involves a public key being used with a private key to . package up and send information securely.

The microphone records these subtle loop sounds to build a picture of what the RSA key looks like.

This method could, in theory, also be used to steal passwords, logins or any other secure information entered into a web page. This is because when data is entered into a website and sent over a secure server using what’s called an RSA algorithm, the CPUs make unique and distinctive sounds known as loops.

Once it knows each part of the 4096-bit encryption key, it uses a method called a 'key extraction attack' to reveal the information. This whole process can be carried out in less than an hour, according to the researchers, by low-quality microphones placed near the PC, to high-quality microphones placed up to 13ft away. When data is sent over a secure server and decrypted, using what's called an RSA algorithm, CPUs make unique and distinctive sounds known as loops. The microphone records these subtle loop sounds to build a picture of what the RSA key looks like. Different PCs make different sounds, as shown in these recordings . Early this month, German computer scientists . proved that malware can travel between machines using sound waves that are inaudible to . unsuspecting humans. Using built-in microphones and speakers in . laptops, the researchers managed to transmit passwords and small amounts . of data between machines 65ft away from each other. They came up with a hack using sound to steal data from . protected machines and suggested that noise could be used to pass data . between target computers and the ‘hacker’ machine. The . researchers chose to use sounds that are too high pitched for humans to . hear and harnessed the microphone and speakers in a Lenovo T400 computer . to transmit keystrokes from one computer to another. The researchers said this distance could also be increased using a laser microphone or vibrometer. However, in order to hack the emails in the study, the researchers did have to send thousands of encrypted emails. The email client had to then decrypt them all automatically, without opening individual emails. Plus the noises made during decryption had to be clear enough to recognise and were made using a specific software called GnuPG. It is unclear how effective the process would be if any of these variables changed. As the researchers explained in their paper RSA Key Extraction via Low-Bandwidth Acoustic Cryptanalysis: ‘We describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack, applicable to GnuPG’s current implementation of RSA. The attack can extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. ‘We experimentally demonstrate that such attacks can be carried out, using either a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more sensitive microphone placed 4 meters away.’ The developers of GnuPG have also now developed a patch for this vulnerability, included in version 1.4.16 of GnuPG.","Scientists have found a way to hack PCs based on the noises they make .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . An underwater turtle that is designed to help archaeologists investigate shipwrecks, has gone on show in the UK for the first time. U-CAT was created by engineers in Estonia to dive to inaccessible places too dangerous or deep for humans. It is part of the Science Museum’s Robot Safari exhibition that runs over the weekend and showcases 13 machines inspired by nature, including a flying bat, glowing fish and even a tumbleweed. Scroll down for video . The robot was designed with fins instead of propellers so it can still be driven in all directions without disturbing water and beating up silt from the bottom, which would decrease visibility inside the shipwreck . The U-CAT turtle can operate independently, inspecting wrecks for hours before resurfacing, and has not been shown in the UK before. The creators of the prototype, from Tallinn University of Technology, Centre for Biorobotics, Estonia, designed it especially to explore shipwrecks and made it cheap enough for smaller companies to invest in. The robot has four independently driven flippers to make it highly manoeuvrable and it is able to swim backwards as well as forwards, travel upwards and even turn in tight spaces. Here, the U-Cat robotic turtle explores a simulation of a wreck in a demonstration. It has a camera onboard and can record what it sees so video footage can later be used to reconstruct a site underwater . Tallinn University of Technology, Centre for Biorobotics, Estonia, has created 'Arrows' - an archaeology robot designed to dive to dangerous depths. The robotic turtle can operate independently, inspecting wrecks for hours before resurfacing, and has not been shown in the UK before . It has a camera onboard and can record what it sees so video footage can later be used to reconstruct a site underwater. Traditionally, propellers have been used to create small underwater exploration vehicles, but they can stir up sediment, obscuring the view from a camera. Taavi Salumäe, the designer of the U-CAT concept and researcher at the university, told Live Science: ‘Fin propulsors of U-CAT can drive the robot in all directions without disturbing water and beating up silt from the bottom, which would decrease visibility inside the shipwreck.’ U-CAT, pictured here out of water, has been designed to be smaller and cheaper than underwater exploration vehicles used in the gas, oil and defense industries . Professor Maarja Kruusmaa, head of the university’s Centre for Robotics, said: ‘The so called biomimetic robots - robots based on animals and plants - are an increasing trend in robotics where we try to overcome the technological bottlenecks by looking at alternative technical solutions provided by nature.’ While a number of underwater exploration robots are available and are frequently used in the oil, gas and defence industries, they are mostly too large and expensive to be used by people exploring shipwrecks. The robot has four independently driven flippers to make it highly manoeuvrable and it is able to swim backwards as well as forwards, travel upwards and even turn in tight spaces . This is why U-CAT has been invented as an affordable alternative to putting human divers in potentially dangerous situations. The device is part of the Arrows project, which is an EU-funded project to make underwater archaeology easier. The various innovations, will be tested in . the Mediterranean and the Baltic seas where devices like the underwater . turtle will assist larger underwater robots to identify interesting . underwater sites. Jessiko is a luminous robotic fish. In a shoal it shows how robots can work together and may be useful for studying the behaviour of real fish. Jessiko, which was created by Robotswim SARL, France, will go on show for the first time in the UK . An extra-small version of the turtle joins other robtiic animals at the exhibition, including a robotic cheetah-cub, a shoal of luminous robotic fish . and the unveiling of Pleurobot, a mechanical salamander at the Science Museum's Robot Safari. Visitors to the exhibition, which runs for a long weekend until December 1, can trek through the unnatural habitats of robots inspired by nature, interacting with creatures that swim, flap, and crawl, in a ‘unique’ safari experience. Roboticists will demonstrate their robots from helping visitors interact with the fish to stretching the bat's wings, while explaining the latest developments in biomimetic robotics. Pleurobot replicates salamander movements recorded from X-ray films and will aid reserach into motor skills, while Salamandra Robotica II is an amphibious robot that can both swim in water and walk . on land. The robot was created to better understand how neural circuits . inside a salamander’s spinal cord enable movement . There are also lessons to help people programme, build and race their own simple robots. Nicola Burghall, Content Developer for Robot Safari at the museum, said: ‘Visitors to Robot Safari will see not just how nature can inspire innovative robotic designs, but also how these biomimetic robots are actually advancing our understanding of the animals and plants they mimic.’ The cheetah robot, may not look that much like its furry inspiration, but it mimics the cat’s legs so it can walk and trot. Cheetah-cub - École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland . Cheetah-cub is the fastest sub-30kg quadruped robot in the world, reaching 1.42m/s. Lightweight, compact and self-stabilising, the robot mimics a cat's legs and is currently being used to investigate the mechanics of cat locomotion . Lightweight and self-stabilising, the next-generation cat is not just a novelty item, but is a research tool that has the potential to be used by scientists to explore rough terrains. The robot, which is built by the robotics laboratory at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland, the cub is the fastest four-legged robot that weighs under 30kg, in the world and can run at 1.42 metres per second. The researchers are also debuting their robotic salamander – the Pleurobot – for the first time. Bat-Bot uses extremely light artificial muscles to move. Its wings change shape during flight to efficiently manoeuvre. It was created by the Centre for Automatic and Robotics of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Spain and will go on show for the first time in the UK . Professor Auke Ijspeert of EPFL, said: ‘Cheetah-cub mimics much of cat morphology – featuring significant simplifications and better performance than traditional quadruped robots – while the salamander-like Pleurobot represents the next stage in our quest to understand how the nervous system controls rich movement. ‘We aim to use Pleurobot for paleontology and robotics research, as we attempt to bring early tetrapods to life.’ The Bat-Bot uses extremely light . artificial muscles to move and its wings change shape during flight, . while Robo Spyder moves like the real thing and can negotiate obstacles . as well as react to sound.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It has remained a secret for thousands of years, but now a huge pink tomb of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh has identified approximately one year after it was discovered. The vast 3,800-year-old quartzite sarcophagus belongs to a little-known 13th Dynasty king called Sobekhotep I, according to the Egyptian government. It was discovered by a team of U.S. and Egyptian archaeologists at the Abydos site near Sohag in Egypt and could shed light on a little known period of history. Last week it was announced that a vast 3,800-year-old quartzite sarcophagus belongs to a little-known 13th dynasty king, Sobekhotep I. It was discovered by an international team of researchers who deciphered inscriptions to link it to its owner . Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep (now believed to be Sobekhotep I) was an Egyptian pharaoh of the 13th Dynasty during the Second Intermediate Period who reigned for at least 3 years. His chronological position is much debated as he could either have been the founder of the dynasty, or its 20th ruler, in which case he is called Sobekhotep II. His tomb was discovered in Abydos in 2013 but has only just been identified. The king is mentioned in the Kahun papyrus IV - a type of census - a fragment on a chapel and door knocker from Medmud, as well as some small artefacts. Based on his name, it is thought that Sobekhotep was a son of the penultimate pharaoh of the 12th Dynasty, king Amenemhat IV. Along with the vast sarcophagus, archaeologists found parts of canopic jars, funerary objects and some gold objects belonging to the king, at the site of his burial. It is thought that his tomb was topped with a pyramid, although none of the structure has been found. Egypt’s State Minister of Antiquities, Mohamed Ibrahim confirmed the identification of the sarcophagus, which weighs almost 60 tonnes. Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and Egypt’s Antiquities Ministry deciphered stone pieces inscribed with the pharaoh’s name, which also show him sitting on a throne, to link the tomb to its owner. ‘He is likely the first who ruled Egypt at the start of the 13th Dynasty during the second intermediate period,’ the minister said. King Sobekhotep I is thought to have ruled the 13th Dynasty but little is known about him and his kingdom or even when the dynasty began exactly, which makes the discovery particularly important. Historians believe that it began sometime between 1803BC and 1781BC but they are keen to establish a precise date. He is thought to have ruled for almost five years, which was ‘the longest rule at this time’ according to ministry official Ayman El-Damarani. The tomb was discovered at the Abydos site (pictured) near Sohag in Egypt and could lead to more royal tombs being unearthed. Last week it was announced that the same archaeological team had uncovered the Tomb of pharaoh Sobekhotep I . The sacred city of Abydos is located west of the Nile and was once a cemetery for Egyptian royalty as well as a popular pilgrimage site where people journeyed to worship the god Osiris, according to The Huffington Post. Temples, royal boat pits and the tombs of kings have previously been unearthed by University of Pennsylvania archaeologists who have been excavating the site over three decades. The team has already found fragments of canopic vases in the tomb, which were used to preserve internal body organs, TimesLive reported. Gold objects thought to be owned by the king were also discovered and it is hoped that the site will reveal more details about the king’s life.

"By . Ben Spencer . Scientists have discovered the first new river dolphin species in almost 100 years. They have named the new breed, which is only the fifth river dolphin species in the world, ‘Araguaia’, after the Brazilian river where it was found. Writing in the journal Plos One, the researchers say the new species, the first discovered since 1918, diverged from other South American river species more than two million years ago. Scientists have named the breed, which is only the fifth river dolphin species in the world, ¿Araguaia¿, (pictured) after the Brazilian river where it was found. It is the first new species of river dolphin discovered since 1918 . They estimate there are 1,000 of the creatures living in the Araguaia river basin. River dolphins are incredibly rare. Out of the five species, three are on the critically endangered Red List, and the scientists believe the Araguaia dolphins should join them. They tend to have long beaks which let them hunt for fish in the mud at the bottom of rivers, unlike the short-nosed sea dolphins. Dr Tomas Hrbek, from the Federal University of Amazonas, said: ‘It was something that was very unexpected, it is an area where people see them all the time, they are a large mammal, the thing is nobody really looked. It is very exciting.’ River dolphins are incredibly rare. Out of the five species, three are on the critically endangered Red List, and the scientists believe the Araguaia dolphins (skulls pictured) should join them. They tend to have long beaks which let them hunt for fish in the mud at the bottom of rivers . The closest relation to the new breed, the Amazon or pink river dolphin, is said to be the most intelligent of all the river species. The scientists say there are some differences in the number of teeth and they suspect the Araguaia river species is smaller, but most of the clues to the difference were found in their genes. Dr Hrbek said the dolphins are at risk because they clash with local fishermen. ‘The dolphins are at the top of the line, they eat a lot of fish,’ he said. ‘They rob fishing nets so the fishermen tend to not like them, people shoot them.’","Scientists have named the new breed, which is .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The 100-year-old mystery surrounding how four-legged animals developed the ability to breathe air has finally been solved. Scientists claim the ability was passed down by ancient Gogonasus -  a group of fish widely regarded by scientists as the ancestors from which the first land animals evolved. They believe Gogonasus originally developed their breathing abilities using tiny holes in the top of their heads called ‘spiracles’. Gogonasus originally developed their breathing abilities using tiny holes in the top of their heads called spiracles (right). The same ability can be seen in Polypterus, the most primitive bony fish alive today (left) The same ability can be seen in Polypterus, the most primitive bony fish alive today. In Polypterus, a small valve opens a lid over these spiracles to allow air to be sucked in and pumped out each time the fish surfaces. These same holes in Gogonasus were also transformed through evolution to become Eustachian tubes, which allow humans to hear. ‘Until now we’ve only had theories about the origins of breathing in the evolution of fish to land animals,’ said Flinders University palaeontologist Professor John Long. Air-breathing fish, such as Polypterus palmas, revealed how four-legged animals developed the ability to breathe . Research into Polypterus dates back to Napoleon’s defeat by the British at Alexandria in 1801. One of his appointed naturalists, Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, had a specimen of a strange fish with fleshy limbs caught from the Nile River. Writing in The Conversation, Professor Long notes that this was the Polypyterus, meaning 'many fins'. Also called the reedfish or birchir, it is widely regarded as the most primitive living member of the true bony fish. This group includes some 30,000 living species, including many of the fishes like snapper and salmon. Further expeditions set out in the late 1890s to find more specimens of this strange fish. Scientists thought that understanding its life history would reveal how fishes might have evolved into land animals. ‘Some early 19th Century scientists had these wacky ideas that fish just jumped onto the land and started gasping for breath and developing limbs,’ he said. ‘But our research shows that the transformation actually started happening within the fish themselves while they were still in water.’ Breathing through the spiracle gives the fish an evolutionary advantage as they can surface to breathe while keeping their eyes under water for predators. As part of the study, a team based at the Scripps Research Institute observed species of Polypterus for 360 hours and measured the amount of oxygen it was taking in. Professor Long said the findings on Polypterus is the ‘smoking gun’ that points to fossils such as Gogonasus as being capable of breathing in air through their spiracles. ‘Other lobed-finned fish fossils of that age show large spiracles on top of their heads and the earliest known tetrapod fossils also have large open spiracles on their heads. ‘All this points to the ability of these fishes to take in air from their spiracles as the first type of breathing, which ultimately helped them leave the water and invade the land.’ Professor Long said once the four-legged descendants of the lobed-finned fish abandoned the water, the ability to breathe through their spiracles declined as they switched to breathing using their mouths and nostrils, as humans do today. ‘The spiracles eventually became the hearing canal in which tetrapods transmitted sound to the brain via tiny inner ear bones, and this has remained throughout the evolution of fish right through to humans,’ he said. ‘If not for the bold evolutionary experiments of these prehistoric fish breathing in air through the top of their heads, we might not have evolved such a keen sense of hearing.’ Professor Long said the findings on Polypterus is the 'smoking gun' that points to fossils such as Gogonasus (pictured) as being capable of breathing in air through their spiracles .","Gogonasus, fish ancestors of land animals, breathed through 'spiracle' holes .

"By . Mark Prigg . China has restored communications with its space programme's Jade Rabbit moon rover, but engineers are still working to fix its mechanical problems, state media said. The official Xinhua News Agency cited Pei Zhaoyu, the lunar probe programme's spokesman, as saying the rover had survived the frigid cold of the lunar night that began on 25 Jan. The Jade Rabbit rover is designed to roam the lunar surface for three months while surveying for natural resources and sending back data. After five months stranded on the moon, China's Jade Rabbit lunar rover is still alive and functional. Chinese state media said on yesterday that technical problems and bitterly cold lunar nights have 'weakened considerably' the buggy's ability to operate . But it ran into problems as it was shutting down in preparation for the lunar night, which lasts two weeks. The problems were a rare setback for China, which in recent years has conducted space walks and placed a space station in orbit. Yesterday China's Jade Rabbit Moon rover was . declared dead on the Moon's surface in a major setback for the country's . ambitious space programme. The potential to extract the moon's resources has been touted as a key reason behind Beijing's space programme. The . moon is believed to hold uranium, titanium, and other mineral . resources, as well as offering the possibility of solar power . generation. 'China wants to . go to the moon for geostrategic reasons and domestic legitimacy,' said . China space expert Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor of national security . affairs at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. 'With . the U.S. exploration moribund at best, that opens a window for China to . be perceived as the global technology leader - though the U.S. still . has more, and more advanced, assets in space. 'The landing was a . key step forward in Beijing's ambitious military-run space programme, . which include plans for a permanent orbiting station by 2020 and . eventually sending a human to the moon. But Pei said the rover had 'come back to life' despite space experts' earlier concerns that it might not survive the extremely low temperatures of the lunar night, when the temperature drops to -180ºC (-292°F). 'The rover stands a chance of being saved now that it is still alive,' Pei was quoted as saying. He said it was still unclear what caused the problem. The mission is proving a popular success for China's military-backed space programme. Updates about the rover's progress have been posted on an unofficial Chinese microblog account written with Jade Rabbit's 'voice', attracting tens of thousands of comments by Chinese Internet users. The Jade Rabbit, or Yutu in Chinese, was deployed on the moon on December 15 and was a huge source of pride in China, which is only the third country to complete a lunar rover mission after the United States and the former Soviet Union. The silver rover experienced a 'mechanical control abnormality' late January due to 'the complicated lunar surface environment', according to the official Xinhua news agency, and has been unable to function since then. Condolences poured in on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service, where Internet users mourned the demise of the rover, according to China News Service's report titled 'Loss of lunar rover'. The Jade Rabbit rover had previously sent back its first pictures from the moon and officials lauded the first lunar soft landing in nearly four decades as a step forward for 'mankind as a whole'. A photo from 99m above the moon. China's space programme has made steady progress since the country launched its first manned spacecraft in 2003 . 'Exploration of outer space is an unremitting pursuit of mankind,' China's space agency, the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence (SASTIND) said after the rover was deployed on the moon. The mission reflects 'the new glory of China to scale the peaks in world science and technology areas,' it said, adding it was committed to exploring and using space 'for peaceful purposes'. The lunar mission, which comes a decade after China first sent an astronaut into space, is seen as a symbol of the country's rising global stature and technological advancement, as well as the Communist Party's success in reversing the fortunes of the once-impoverished nation. Beijing plans to establish a permanent space station by 2020 and eventually send a human to the moon. The sky over the moon appears inky black in this picture showing the Jade Rabbit rover trundling across the lunar surface taken from the Chang'e 3 lander . The potential to extract the moon's resources has been touted as a key reason behind Beijing's space programme, as the moon believed to hold uranium, titanium, and other mineral resources, as well as offering the possibility of solar power generation. The six-wheeled Yutu vehicle began operating last month after making the first soft landing on the moon by a space probe in 37 years. It is designed to roam the lunar surface for three months while surveying for natural resources and sending back data, along with its stationary lander, Chang'e 3. A digitally-combined panoramic photo shows the moonscape around the Yutu - Jade Rabbit - moon rover . Over 150,000 people follow the rover's progress on its microblog, which posted on Saturday that repairs were underway and that all hope was not lost. ‘Sorry to make you all sad. The engineers and I haven't given up yet,’ the post said. News of the rover's troubles were splashed across Chinese newspapers on Monday and even featured at the Foreign Ministry's daily briefing. The problems appeared to be related to the solar-powered probe's process for shutting down for the lunar night, which lasts more than two weeks. The probe had survived its first shutdown, during which it was unable to generate energy from its solar panels and relies on a radioactive power source to keep its delicate sensors and other equipment intact. The rover was traversing a relatively flat part of the moon known as Sinus Iridum, or the Bay of Rainbows, at a speed of 200 yards per hour. The landing vehicle, which has already shut down for the lunar night, is designed to conduct scientific examinations for one year. Online speculation focused on the possibility of lunar dust having blocked one of the solar panels from folding inward, leaving equipment exposed to the dangerously low temperatures. It will not be known if the probe is able to function again until after the two-week break. Chinese scientists test the moon rover ahead of its launch.

"By . Mark Prigg . It is certainly a unique sight, and one that could, it is claimed, save thousands of lives. A bicycle with a giant set of light up cat's whiskers if the latest gadget aiming to make cyclist's lives safer. They can be used to warn other road users a cyclist is approaching, let drivers know exactly how much space is needed, and even twitch to indicate a turn. Scroll down for video . The life-saving whiskers: The strands of smart material can extend to mark space, and twitch when the user wants to turn . The four whiskers can change their configuration, allowing the cyclists to signal their intentions. Controlled by a button on the handlebars, the four long whiskers on the Vibrasee can flick fully outward, discouraging a car from squeezing by. Reflective stripes make each whisker stand out even more. When a cyclist wants to turn, they can flick the whiskers on one side in the right direction and flash lights inside as a signal. Called VibriSee, the whiskers were invented by students at California State University-Long Beach. 'When you’re in the middle of the street with cars, what tends to happen is drivers see the space around you and they’ll attempt to pass,' Channing Shattuck, who worked on the design for the Vibrasee with five fellow students, told Fastco. 'It’s dangerous for the cyclist, and dangerous for the car if there’s oncoming traffic. But what if we could expand the bike to look bigger, so cars don't try to go around?'

Reflective stripes make each whisker stand out even more. When a cyclist wants to turn, they can flick the whiskers on one side in the right direction and flash lights inside as a signal. The whiskers can glow at night, and when they are needed to act as turn indicators . 'Cycling as a form of transportation is a growing alternative to fossil-fuel powered vehicles, but as cycling grows more popular each year, cities like Long Beach are implementing initiatives to develop their infrastructure in order to accommodate this exploding demographic,' the students wrote. 'By interviewing various members of the Long Beach bicycle community, we were able to determine three main concerns: communication of a bicyclist’s intentions, increased visibility both day & night, and proper allocation of space when sharing the road.' The team then spent time at zoos and animal parks to look at how nature approached the problem. 'By visiting various biomes within our city and with the help of university biologists, we identified several animals that have evolved attributes with the potential to solve these concerns - namely peacocks, ctenophores, and rodents. 'Using their unique traits, we designed VibriSee, a mountable bicycle accessory that sports flexible, illuminated whiskers. 'These luminescent tendrils provide the user with several opportunities,' the researchers say. 'First, they exponentially increase visibility of the cyclists both day and night through a combination of both fluorescent bands and stripes of emitted light. 'Second, these four whiskers can change their configuration, allowing the cyclists to signal their intentions. 'Finally, VibriSee empowers the cyclist with the ability to indicate their spatial zone by flaring their whiskers and flashing warning colors.' The project was part of the Biomimicry Student Design Challenge, which asked design students to take inspiration from local ecology to tackle a transportation issue.","Controlled by a button on the handlebars, whiskers contain lights .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The tedious search to find a parking space in a busy city will soon be a thing of the past – in Pisa, Italy, at least. Testing of an intelligent parking system is under way in the home of the Leaning Tower, which helps drivers find a suitable space to park their car and pay for the space quickly. It combines sensors on the floors of spaces, boards across the city and smart street lighting to help drivers find parking spots at the touch of a button. Testing of an intelligent parking system (pictured) is under way Pisa, which helps drivers find a suitable space to park their car quickly and allows them to pay for the parking on their smartphone . The pilot scheme was created as a partnership between Deutsche Telekom and Kiunsys. The new smart city service has been installed on Piazza Carrara, which is located directly on the banks of the river Arno. Sensors on the floor of each parking spot detect whether they are free or occupied, while several data units collect the information and send it over the mobile network to the city's server infrastructure. The information is then displayed on indication panels, which guide drivers to a free space. Drivers can choose to pay for their parking using Pisa’s existing Tap&Park app – which integrates with the new system. ‘The new parking system integrates seamlessly into our intelligent transport system (ITS),’ the mayor of Pisa, Marco Filippeschi, said. ‘It eases the flow of traffic and helps to cut CO2 emissions.’ The new smart city service has been installed on Piazza Carrara (pictured), which is located directly on the banks of the river Arno . Drivers can choose to pay for their parking using Pisa’s existing Tap&Park app – which integrates with the new system (pictured left). They can also see the location of free parking spaces in the new app (right) as well as on display panels in the city . For years, Pisa has been working on a smart mobility policy as part of its Sustainable Energy Action Plan. Mayor Filippeschi said: ‘The pilot project is a big stride for Pisa towards improving its traffic situation over the long term. ‘Indeed, drivers looking for a parking space make up some 30 percent of inner-city traffic. So the easier it is for them to find a spot, the less traffic there will be.’ Around 90,000 motorists take to the city’s roads every day as Pisa is not only a tourist destination, but is home to three universities, a high profile hospital and the main airport of Tuscany. Pisa has been using Kiunsys’ Tap&Park app for mobile paymet for years, as well as 30,000 RFID ‘Pisa Pass’ parking badges and its INeS Cloud management software.

Drivers looking for a parking space in Pisa (pictured) make up 30 per cent of inner-city traffic, so the parking trial is expected to decrease traffic congestion across the bustling Italian city . Pisa has already been using a range of modules from Deutsche Telekom's partner company Kiunsys for several years. These include the Tap&Park app for mobile payment of parking charges, 30,000 RFID parking badges – known as 'PisaPass' – and INeS Cloud management. Tiziano Di Sciullo, Sales Manager at Kiunsys, said: ‘The modular solution can digitally map all processes relating to parking facility management and traffic in the city.’ As a result, Pisa has already been collecting traffic-related data over the past few years, which will now be analysed as part of the pilot project. The partners hope to gain a deeper insight into how the traffic infrastructure is used, which will benefit traffic planning in future. A robot named 'Ray' (pictured) has been developed to help spatially-challenged drivers fit into tight spaces by automatically parking their car for them. The technology, currently being used at Düsseldorf International Airport, claims to be able to park 60 per cent more vehicles in one area compared with a human driver .

The technology, currently being used at Düsseldorf International Airport, claims to be able to park 60 per cent more vehicles in one area compared to a human driver. A driver leaves their car at a Vehicle Transfer Station (VTS), which uses laser scanners to measure the precise height and width of the vehicle. The system then calculates the position of the vehicle’s wheels and measures other key parts such as the wing mirrors and the bumper. Once this is done, the driver is issued with a ticket from a terminal where they can leave their vehicle in Ray’s mechanical 'hands'. Ray has four wheels that can turn a full 360-degrees, allowing it to manoeuvre into extremely tight spaces. Approaching from the side, Ray picks up the car by sliding one set of its forks each under its front and rear wheels. The car is then transported to the parking spot selected by the system’s software. When a driver wants their car back, they pay the ticket and their vehicle will be brought to a nearby VTS.","The intelligent parking system is on trial in Piazza Carrara in Pisa, Italy .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . The combination of a thin atmosphere and lack of oxygen makes the chances of finding life on the surface of Mars slim. However, it has long been theorised that life could survive underground – but getting there has posed a problem. One solution though might be Exolance, a proposal from a team of scientists to launch missiles into the surface of the red planet packed with probes rather than explosives. A team of scientists from the non-profit group Explore Mars have come up with a proposal that they say could find life beneath the surface of the red planet. Called Exolance, the mission would fire missiles at the surface and bury experiments underground . The proposal comes from the non-profit group Explore Mars, based in Beverly, Massachusetts. Amongst its team includes Gilbert Levin, who previously led an experiment on one of Nasa’s 1976 Viking Mars landers that he was certain found evidence of life, although Nasa disagreed. Now he and the rest of the team are hoping to prove once and for all that the red planet is habitable with their ambitious proposal. ‘Exolance incorporates a delivery system that was originally designed for military purposes,’ the team writes on their website. The mission would use a series of small lightweight penetrator probes called ‘Arrows’ that would take life detection equipment underground. They would do this by impacting the surface at high speeds after being released from a carrier spacecraft. A series of Arrows the company calls a ‘Quiver’ would be integrated into a lander and released as it made its way to the surface. Within each impactor would be experiments at the tip and communications equipment at the back so it could relay information to an orbiting spacecraft and then back to Earth. The Arrows would also have a drilling capability allowing them to dig down to a total of 16.5 ft (five metres). Each missile, known as an Arrow, has a hardened penetrator on the front end and has a set of fins on the back end. The middle of the probe is a cylinder that splits into two pieces when the arrow impacts the surface. The first piece stays with the penetrator and burrows into the Martian surface to a depth of up to 6.5 feet (two metres) This piece contains the life detection experiment in a small cylinder behind the penetrator. This ‘metabolic test’ could distinguish between non-living chemistry and living microorganisms. The team says if it detects life the experiment could determine if it is related to Earth life or is a new strain. The second piece stays on the surface, where the fins act as stops to prevent it from going down into the hole. This piece houses the radio equipment that sends the signals back to an orbiting relay on one of the existing Mars orbiters. Once successfully deployed, the life detection experiment begins. By deploying multiple probes, data sampling is expanded to multiple sites, which improves the science and reliability. Having multiple probes allows for individual probe failures without losing the entire mission. This . concept borrows from several engineering designs already in practice. The penetrator design is based on military ‘bunker buster’ technology. The split segments concept was pioneered by NASA in the late 1990’s on the Deep Space 2 mission. Exolance would be carrier to Mars by another spacecraft. The mission could comprise several penetrator probes, known as 'Arrows', that would be held in a 'Quiver' on the carrier vehicle, which would safely transport them through the atmosphere (artist's illustration shown) Once through the atmosphere the lander carrying the Quiver would deploy its parachute and begin its gradual descent to the surface, at which point the Arrows would be released to various locations . The team hopes to begin testing the concept in the Mojave Desert later this year. This location, they say, features Mars-like characteristics that will allow the concept to be tested to an adequate degree. ‘We will be able to test both the delivery system (from an aircraft) as well as the ground penetrating arrows,’ they write. ‘These tests will verify the average depth of penetration and the life detection experiment within the arrows.’ This will be phase 1 of the tests – phase 2 will be to test the microbial life detection experiments. The team says that a number of upcoming Mars missions, including Nasa’s 2016 Insight mission and Esa’s 2018 ExoMars mission, could carry Exolance. ‘Once the concept is sufficiently tested and we have proven the viability of the mission concept,’ the team writes. ‘We will urge Nasa, other space agencies, and potential commercial providers to carry Exolance on one or more future Mars missions.’ The Arrows would bury initially to about 6.5 feet (two metres). Using a drill, however, they could bury to a total depth of 16.5 feet (five metres) where life detection equipment would be deployed . Nasa's Curiosity rover (artist's illustration shown) is currently on Mars trying to ascertain if the red planet was or still is habitable. The Exolance team hope that their mission can be incorporated on a future Mars mission such as Nasa's Insight in 2016 or Esa's Exomars in 2018.","A team of scientists has come up with a novel proposal to find life on Mars .

"By . Ben Spencer . Apple iPhone users will soon be able to have their blood pressure, temperature and pulse monitored by their mobile – and the results sent direct to their GP. The company has unveiled an app called HealthKit which offers the ability to send data to your family doctor. It will rely on additional equipment, such as a wrist-strap  heart monitor that connects wirelessly to the iPhone. Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks about iOS 8 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco yesterday . But Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, said a key feature of the app was its ability to send an automatic alert to a doctor if vital signs approach dangerous levels. And it wasn’t the only development revealed by the firm yesterday. Parents will also be able to receive an alert if their children try to buy music or games online. Company boss Tim Cook announced that the new ‘Family Sharing’ feature will allow up to six members of a family to share apps, photos and music on their iPhones, iPads and Apple Mac computers. The functions, part of Apple’s new iOS 8 software, means parents can save money because they will not have to buy an app for themselves and each of their children. Apple's senior vice-president of software engineering Craig Federighi spoke about an app that could send information to your family doctor . Calendars, books and films will also be shared across computers and mobile phones. But parents concerned about their children racking up huge bills through online games will be most interested in the new payment controls. Family Sharing will allow apps to be purchased with only one credit card. It means a parent will receive a notification on their mobile phone if a child wants to make a purchase, with permission needed before the transaction can go ahead. The firm also launched HomeKit, a system to allow users to control appliances by turning their iPhone into a remote. As reported in the Daily Mail last week, Apple has been working with appliance manufacturers to allow iPhones to control heating systems, security alarms and ovens from a distance. The software, officially launched last night at Apple’s annual conference in San Francisco, will also allow iPhones to open doors, control lights – even carry out commands such as ‘get ready for bed’, which would dim lights and lock all doors. Another new feature is the Apple CarPlay system, announced earlier this year, which links an iPhone to a car’s sound system. It allows a driver to access the phone’s Siri voice recognition software via a vehicle’s radio to make hands-free calls and listen to voicemail. Mr Cook will hope the updates return Apple to the levels of popularity last seen under co-founder Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. With iPhone and iPad sales no longer as high as they once were, Mr Cook has been under immense pressure to come up with technology to take on rivals such as Samsung. He told the 5,000-strong audience the firm’s software had been completely redesigned to work ‘seamlessly’. ‘Together our devices provide an integrated and continuous experience across all of them,’ he said. ‘Apple engineers platforms, devices and services together. We do this so we can create a seamless experience for our users that is unparalleled in the industry. This is something only Apple can do.’","New Apple HealthKit app offers ability to send data to family doctor .

"By . Kate Lyons . A gel that was found to reduce the rate of HIV infection among monkeys when administered after sex could possibly work on humans too, researchers have found. Scientists have found that monkeys can be protected against HIV infection with a vaginal gel, even when it is administered three hours after sex. The research, which was published in Science Translational Medicine on Wednesday, tested a  new microbicidal vaginal gel on macaque monkeys. Macaque monkeys were treated with the new gel and five out of the six monkeys were protected from infection . 12 monkeys were given vaginal washes of simian HIV to mimic sex with an infected monkey. Three hours later, six of these monkeys were treated with the newly-developed gel and the other six were given a placebo gel. Of the six macaques given the new gel, only one was infected with HIV, compared to all six of the monkeys who were treated with the placebo. If the gel works in humans, it could represent a breakthrough for preventing HIV infection, particularly for women who have been raped. Sharon L. Hillier, a professor of obstetrics at the University of Pittsburgh, told the New York Times that if the gel worked in humans, ‘it could be used for HIV prevention like Plan B or the morning-after pill for contraception’. The gel contains raltegravri, antiretroviral drug already in use for HIV treatment, and some HIV-prevention gels do exist, but they usually require a pre-exposure dose. Success in monkeys does not always predict success among humans, and testing such drugs on humans is complicated and raises serious ethical considerations. However, the results are encouraging and add to a sense of optimism in the field of HIV research. Two separate trials last week showed that monkeys who received injections of slow-release HIV drugs were protected from infection for weeks. In other research, two babies in the U.S. who were born infected with HIV appear to have been cured by large doses of drugs administered soon after birth. The study adds to other encouraging findings in the field of AIDS research in the last few weeks .","Research published this week found that a gel reduced rate of HIV-infection .

Whether you like to admit it or not, it's difficult to resist tapping your foot to a solid bassline such as Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love - and now researchers have discovered why. Psychologists from Canada tracked brain activity of volunteers as they listened to piano tones of different pitches. The study found that our ears have developed to easily identify changes in lower tones, and this skill develops at a young age. To find out why lower tones dominate musical rhythms, researchers at the McMaster University in Canada asked 35 volunteers to listen to different pitch piano tones. When the lower tone occurred 50 milliseconds too early, the brain recognised it faster than when the higher tone was mistimed (stock image pictured) To test their theory, researchers at the McMaster University in Canada asked 35 volunteers to listen to two simultaneous streams of computer-synthesized piano tones, each of a different pitch. Chimpanzees like to listen to music - but have very specific tastes, researchers have found. While preferring silence to music from the West, chimpanzees like to listen to the different rhythms of music from Africa and India, researchers found. The research is the first to discover primates have a preference for music, according to the American Psychological Association, which published the study. Previous research has found that some nonhuman primates prefer slower tempos, but the current findings may be the first to show that they display a preference for particular rhythmic patterns, according to the study. A tenth of the time, the lower tone occurred 50 milliseconds too early; another tenth of a time, the higher tone occurred 50 milliseconds too early. Psychologist Laurel Trainor and her colleagues used electroencephalography (EEG) sensors placed on the scalp to track the brain signals of the volunteers as they listened to these tracks. They were looking to see activity that proved when the volunteer had noticed the tones had dropped too soon. This detection is typically depicted as a spike of electrical activity, known as a mismatch negativity (MMN). MMN is produced by the brain's auditory cortex from between 120 and 250 milliseconds after an unexpected sound reachee the ear. This reaction is typically used to sense when the brain detects something is out of place, for example. Researchers used EEG sensors, (pictured on McMaster University student Kristin Tonus) to track brain signals of the volunteers. They were looking for spikes of activity when the tones were mistimed, and this typically occurs 120 to 250 milliseconds after the deviant sound reaches the ear . The researchers discovered that the MMN signals were consistently larger when the lower note was mistimed, compared to the higher notes. They also measured the participants’ ability to adjust their finger-tapping to the variable timings to discover this was more accurate for the lower notes. During a second experiment, the research team used a computer model to study how the ear responds to test sounds. They found that the signal from the auditory nerve connected to the cochlea, part of the inner ear involved with hearing, was also better at detecting timings of low-pitched notes. The researchers discovered that the signals were consistently larger when the lower note was mistimed, compared to the higher notes (pictured). They also measured the participants' ability to adjust their finger-tapping to the variable timings to discover this was more accurate for the lower notes, too . This suggests that the differences develop at an early stage of cognitive processing, and humans may have evolved to make these distinctions. Ms Trainor claimed that her findings explain why the music of many cultures use rhythms created by low-pitched instruments, while the melody tends to be taken by higher pitched instruments. The findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.","Researchers asked 35 volunteers to listen to tones of different pitches .

"By . David Kent . Former Chelsea and England striker Chris Sutton has been declared bankrupt after being caught in a spread betting foreign currency scam. The 41-year-old, who began his career at Norwich City, went bust last week and blamed his problems on bad financial advice. It was revealed last year that Sutton lost £50,000 after being mislead in a multi-million-pound fraud by his former financial adviser Simon Grint. Sutton's wife Samantha also lost the same amount. Bust: Chris Sutton, pictured here managing Lincoln in 2010, has been declared bankrupt . Glory days: Sutton won the Premier League in 1995 with Blackburn strike partner Alan Shearer (left) Flop: Sutton struggled to make an impact during a one-season spell with Chelsea . In a statement released on Saturday night, the ex-Celtic forward said: 'During the investment period, I was led to believe that I was making a . profit on the investment. However, I now realise that I was not.' He also told the Daily Record: 'I’ve been given bad financial advice.' Sutton believed he would make a 'good return' on his investment, but Grint was jailed for his role in the scheme last year. Sutton, who won the Premier League title with Blackburn in 1995, was forced to retire from football in 2007 after suffering an eye injury while playing for Aston Villa. The news comes just two days after former England goalkeeper David James was declared bankrupt despite earning around £20million in his career. The 43-year-old, who now works as a pundit for BT Sport, is believed to have been stung by a costly divorce from wife Tanya in 2005.

"By . Francesca Chambers . The White House spent $2,952,278 in flight expenses this year for two trips President Barack Obama took on which he spent a large chunk of his time playing golf. Obama billed both trips as official business, but he spent more time golfing than he did participating in government meetings, government oversight organization Judicial Watch reports. President Barack Obama boards Marine One helicopter before his departure from Key Largo, Florida on Sunday, March 9. Taxpayers paid $885,683 in Air Force One flight costs alone for Obama's trip . The conservative organization obtained the cost of Obama's Air Force 1 trips through Freedom of Information Act requests. The cost per flying hour of the president's plane is $210,877, the Department of the Air Force told Judicial Watch. The cost per flying hour includes fuel, food consumed on the flight and . maintenance to the plane, the Department of the Air Force said in its . response. It does not include the cost of the cargo plane that . accompanies the president, as The White House Dossier points out. The two trips in question occurred in February and March of this year when the president flew to Palm Springs, California, and Key Largo, Florida, respectively. The first trip took place over President's Day weekend from February 17- 20. The total flight cost for this trip was $2,066,594.60, Judicial Watch reports. On the first day of the trip, President Obama arrived in Fresno, California, at 2.30 pm local time. There he met with community leaders at a water facility before touring a local farm and making public remarks on the state's water crisis. 'It can’t just be a matter of there’s going to be less and less water so . I’m going to grab more and more of a shrinking share of water,' Obama . said at the event. 'Instead what we have to do is all come . together and figure out how we all are going to make sure that . agricultural needs, urban needs, industrial needs, environmental and . conservation concerns are all addressed.' Obama then flew to Palm Springs, where he he met with King Abdullah II of Jordan. The two had a working dinner that begin at 7.50 pm local time. The president's public schedule does not say when their meeting ended nor does it say how he spent Saturday, Sunday or the first half of Monday, a federal holiday, before he left Palm Springs at 2 pm local time. Room with a view: This photo taken from inside the Sunnylands Center & Gardens at Rancho Mirage, California, where President Barack Obama played golf two times over President's Day weekend while he was on a trip billed as official White House business . President Barack Obama played golf with friends during his trip to Palm Spring, California at luxury course Porcupine Creek. This exclusive golf course is not open to the public . Time Magazine reports that Obama spent those three days golfing with friends at two of the area's exclusive golf clubs -  Sunnylands and Porcupine Creek. Neither are open to the public. Obama's outings drew ire immediately afterward because the area's golf clubs are a contributing factor to the region's water crisis. Each golf course Obama visited uses an average of one million gallons of water a day to keep the grass green. The courses use three to four times more water per day than normal American golf courses because of the area's hot, dry climate, Time reports. The second trip, which occurred less than a month later, from March 7-9, cost $885,683.40 in flight expenses, the watchdog group said. For that trip, the First Family joined the president. The Obama's arrived in Homestead, Florida, on Friday at 1.40 pm eastern time. The President and the First Lady spoke at a high school at 2.25 pm. There are no public events on the president's schedule after that until Monday morning, when he is listed as having received his daily briefing at the White House at 10 am. The White House said Obama had 'a bit of down time in the warm weather with his wife and daughters' that weekend. The Obama's stayed at the Ocean Reef Club, where the president played two rounds of golf with friends. The First Family was accompanied on that trip by 50 secret service agents and five government helicopters, the Washington Times reports. 'Only President Obama . would deliver a brief speech about education and then have the nerve to . jet over to the posh Ocean Reef Clubs — an exclusive members-only . resort for the wealthy — for a quick vacation,' said Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, in March of the trip. Other costs for the trips such as food and lodging are unknown, but Judicial Watch says the President, Vice President and their immediate families have spent upward of $40 million since 2009 on taxpayer funded trips. The Obama's most expensive trips were in 2013 when they went to Africa and Honolulu, Hawaii, the reports says. Obama billed both trips as official business, but he spent more time golfing than he did participating in government meetings.

"By . John Mcgarry . John Collins last night declared himself entirely at ease with the prospect of being reunited with Scott Brown at Celtic. Collins’ tenure as Hibernian boss ended in 2007 shortly after a dressing room containing the midfielder allegedly took their misgivings about their manager’s approach to chairman Rod Petrie’s door. Last week, however, Brown attempted to defuse any potential problem in a transatlantic call to manager Ronny Deila in which he told the Norwegian he fully endorsed Collins’ impending appointment as his No 2. New man: Collins has put any old disagreements behind him as he prepares to get started at Celtic . And yesterday Collins also declared there was no issue by detailing the ringing endorsement he gave Brown when Gordon Strachan inquired about him shortly before his £4.4million move to Celtic Park. ‘It’s important we nail that,’ Collins stated. ‘I never had any problems with Scott when I was Hibs manager. ‘He was brilliant for me and that’s why he got his big move to Celtic. Accepted: Collins and Brown are ready to work together again, this time with Celtic under Delia . ‘I actually played a little part in him coming here as Gordon asked me: ‘What’s the boy Brown like? 'I gave Gordon a glowing reference and told him to make sure he didn’t miss out on him. To pay what it would take to get him as he was a top player. He’s my type of player. He trains properly and has developed into a leader and captain of Celtic. ‘Ronny asked me if there were any problems between myself and Scott and I told him there were no problems whatsoever.’ Finally unveiled as Deila’s assistant yesterday, Collins revealed he had rejected several advances to return to the front-line since leaving his role as Livingston’s director of football a year ago. The chance to return to Celtic Park 18 years after his departure for Monaco proved just too tempting though. Captain's orders: Brown gave Collins' appointment at Celtic his blessing after a phone call from Delia . ‘You always hope as a player when you leave such a big club, and great club, that one day you’ll come back,’ the  46-year-old added. ‘So, I’m delighted to be here. It’s a great opportunity. Coming to Celtic now is a different feeling than it was when I signed as a player. As a player, you are only thinking about yourself. ‘As a coach, you are thinking of everything. You are thinking about all of the players and the staff, about different training sessions. ‘I have had offers to come back in but it’s never been right.’ Meanwhile, Deila’s first game in charge of Celtic will come against Russian outfit FK Krasnodar on July 3 after the club confirmed details of their Austria tour. That friendly in Bad Wimbsbach will be followed by a visit to old foes Rapid Vienna three days later. They face Lask Linz on July 8 before completing their Austria stay with a July 11 game against Czech side Dukla Prague in Freistadt.

United’s pride in developing great young players for their first-team has been dented in recent years by the departure for different reasons of Gerard Pique, Giuseppe Rossi and Paul Pogba, who have all gone on to enjoy great success elsewhere.

To address the problem, Giggs has been told that one of his major jobs as assistant-manager to the incoming Louis van Gaal is to be a liason between the under-21 development squad and the first-team. He will be expected to recommend to the Dutchman which players are ready to step up to train with the senior squad and who has the potential to play alongside the likes of Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney in competitive games. The first beneficiary could be young midfielder Andreas Pereira who is currently out in China with the Brazilian under-20 team. He has just a year left on his contract at Old Trafford and the club don’t want him to feel unwanted in a possible repeat of the Pogba situation that saw the Frenchman leave for Juventus. Having graduated through United’s ranks himself, Giggs has always maintained a healthy interest in the next generation of players at the club and gave teenagers James Wilson and Tom Lawrence their debuts against Hull City at the end of last season when he was in interim charge.

Last night, Campbell Ogilvie, president of Scottish football’s governing body, paid warm tribute. ‘On behalf of his friends and former colleagues at the SFA, and throughout Scottish football in general, I would like to express our profound sadness at the tragic news of David’s death,’ said Ogilvie. ‘I would also wish to send our deepest condolences to his wife Cathy, and their children  James and Alan, at this  dreadful time. ‘David was a solicitor to trade but it was his love of Scottish football and, in particular, the Scotland national team that stirred his passion during his tenure as chief executive. ‘He was great company, had an astute business mind and a forward-thinking approach to the game that, allied to his patriotism as a member of the Scotland Supporters Club, helped take the SFA forward administratively. Meeting of minds: UEFA president Michel Platini (R) chats with UEFA secretary-general David Taylor in 2009 . Dearly missed: SFA President Campbell Ogilvie was one of many to pay tribute to his former colleague . ‘It was no surprise to any of us who witnessed his work at close hand when UEFA came calling for his services as general secretary in 2007. ‘He has remained a friend and  supporter of the SFA and the game in general in this country and he will be dearly missed by all of us.’ In September, 2011, he collapsed while participating in a football match between UEFA and FIFA. It was reported at the time Taylor stopped breathing for a period before medics managed to revive him with a defibrillator machine. The match was abandoned and the 57-year-old Taylor was rushed to a nearby hospital in Zurich, where he spent several days in intensive care. More tributes were paid from across Scottish football last night, with current SFA chief executive Stewart Regan Tweeting: ‘So sorry to hear that my predecessor, David Taylor, has died today aged 60. ‘A top bloke. Really feel for Cathy, James and Alan. RIP David.’ Great contribution:  Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell extended his condolences on behalf of the club . Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell added: ‘This is devastating news and our thoughts and prayers are with David’s wife, Cathy, and their children, James and Alan. ‘David was a fine man, a personal friend of mine and someone who made a great contribution to the game of football, both in Scotland and across Europe. ‘He will be very sadly missed by everyone who knew him. ‘On behalf of everyone at Celtic Football Club, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to David’s family and friends at this very sad time.’","Former Scottish FA chief executive David Taylor, 60, died through illness .

With Andy Murray KO'd from Wimbledon at the quarter-final stage, Roy Hodgson's sorry Three Lions sent home from the World Cup after just two games, and England's rugby team whitewashed in New Zealand, there hasn't been much for British sporting fans to get excited about this summer. So, it's hardly surprising to see the bookies already backing Formula One star Lewis Hamilton to claim his first Sports Personality of the Year award later this year. A runner-up to boxer Joe Calzaghe in 2007 and then Olympic hero Sir Chris Hoy in 2008, Hamilton is now the 15/8 favourite to claim the coveted gong. Ready for action: Lewis Hamilton is preparing to take part in the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on Sunday . All smiles: Hamilton poses with executive director of Mercedes Paddy Lowe in the paddock at Silverstone . Favourite: Some bookmakers are already tipping Hamilton to be named the BBC's Sports Personality . And the 29-year-old will be given centre stage to stake his claim for votes when over 120,000 fans descend on Northamptonshire, and many more tune in on TV for this weekend's British Grand Prix; the 50th to be held at Silverstone. Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg are expected to pick up their season-long battle with the home crowd largely rooting for the Stevenage-born racer, who last won in front of his home crowd six years ago. Hamilton was victorious in torrid conditions - a masterful drive, where he finished an epic 67 seconds ahead of his nearest challenger. In contrast, Hamilton's former team-mate Jenson Button, reckons he needs somewhat of a 'miracle' to stand on the top step of the rostrum on Sunday. Button, who is in the midst of another disappointing campaign with McLaren, is a whopping 122 points behind Rosberg in the drivers' championship. 'Lewis has got a good chance of . winning,' he told Sportsmail. 'Being British I really hope he does.

Leading the way: Rosberg is currently top of the drivers' world championship standings ahead of Hamilton . Button will be taking part in his first race at Silverstone since the passing of his father, John, who died earlier this year. The .

'I . have made sure I have not pushed it too much, but it is amazing how . many people have got in touch saying they would love to wear pink,' he . said.

"By . Ian Laybourn, Press Association . Joel Tomkins has taken a pay cut to return to rugby league, the dual-code international has revealed. The 27-year-old centre or second rower cut short his stay in rugby union by signing a four-and-a-half year contract with his old club Wigan, who have paid an undisclosed transfer fee to Saracens. 'Obviously the salary cap in rugby union is bigger so the wages are bigger but my motivation in moving to rugby union was never financial,' Tomkins said. Change: Joel Tomkins has taken a pay cut to return to rugby league, the dual-code international has revealed . 'I wanted to try something different and I'm glad I did it. I've had some good experiences.' The Wigan-born Tomkins made three appearances for England during his three seasons in the 15-man code but admits he jumped at the chance to return to his roots, especially under his old mentor Shaun Wane. 'I left the club on really good terms,' he said. 'Me and (chairman) Ian (Lenagan) always said, if the time is right, there would be an opportunity to come back and the time feels right now. 'The top and bottom of it is that I feel I am a better rugby league player than I am a rugby union player. I enjoy playing rugby league more than rugby union. 'I'm 27 now and I feel I have a lot more to give still to the game and to this club. It's about repaying the club now for the confidence they've shown in me. 'It's the best rugby club in the world. One of my main regrets when I left was that I never got to play under Shaun in the first team. I've been with Shaun since I was 13 and it will be nice to work with him in the first team. 'All the family are really chuffed. We've got our first baby on the way so it's quite an exciting time for us off the field as well as on. I'm just looking forward to getting back it.' Wigan rolled out the red carpet, literally, to welcome Tomkins back to the fold at half-time in their 48-4 win over Widnes on Wednesday night that took them to the top of the First Utility Super League. Delighted: Wigan head coach Shaun Wane was pleased to welcome back Tomkins from a stint in rugby union . He came through the club's youth system to make 117 appearances for the senior team from 2005 up to his transfer in 2011, scoring 40 tries including a spectacular long-range effort in the Warriors' Challenge cup final win over Leeds three years ago. Wane said: 'I can't tell you how pleased I am I've got Joel back. He's a special friend and part of the family here. He's going to be a great asset to us and it's a shot in the arm for English rugby league as well.' Tomkins returns to Wigan with both younger brothers currently plying their trade elsewhere but it is conceivable that all three could be reunited at the DW Stadium. Logan, 21, is currently on loan at Salford but is expected to return to Wigan next season and Lenagan has not given up hope of welcoming back England full-back Sam from the NRL when his commitments are complete with New Zealand Warriors. 'I said when we announced Sam and Lee Mossop going that we expected Wigan players would go to the NRL or to rugby union and that two out of three of them would come back,' Lenagan said. 'It's great to see the first one back already and I think there will be a number of those who will do precisely the same when it is right for them and when they've been successful where they've been.' Tomkins, who is set to revert to the back row after turning out in the centre in rugby union, could be set to renew his rugby league international career, with England playing the Four Nations Series in New Zealand and Australia at the end of the season. His last appearance was alongside Sam in England's defeat by Australia in the 2010 Four Nations final at Elland Road. 'I think it will be in the back of the mind of every player who is eligible to play for England but my priority is to get back fit,"" added Tomkins, who is currently recovering from a bulging disc in his back. 'I've got four to six weeks rehab programme and then I'll work my way into this team. The young lads that have come in have played really well so there's a lot of competition for places. My goal is to get into this team before I start to think about the internationals.'","Head coach Shaun Wane is delighted to welcome him back to DW Stadium .

"By . Dominic King . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . Phil Jagielka has admitted England are expecting no favours from Italy after Luis Suarez plunged them to the brink of World Cup elimination. The Liverpool striker underwent knee surgery 28 days ago but he returned from injury to score twice, capitalising on defensive errors as Uruguay won 2-1 in Sao Paulo and leave Roy Hodgson needing a minor miracle for England to continue in the tournament. England can still qualify for the knockout stages if Italy beat Costa Rica tomorrow and then follow up with victory against Uruguay next Tuesday; England would then need to beat Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte to save themselves. VIDEO - Scroll down to see England fans left distraught after Uruguay defeat . Dejected: Jagielka leaves the field at full time after England fell to a late Suarez winner in Sao Paulo . Left standing: Jagielka can only watch on as Luis Suarez scores Uruguay's opener in the Arena Corinthians . But judging by the reaction of Jagielka and the rest of England’s players as they trudged off following a defeat that former manager Glenn Hoddle - speaking as a pundit on ITV - insisted was avoidable, it seems they have already accepted their fate. Jagielka said: ‘It’s gutting, I think. We played so well again in spells but unfortunately if a little bit of luck had gone our way... if Steve (Gerrard) hadn’t ended up flicking the ball on, Suarez wouldn’t have been on side. You just hope that he miss-hits it but he finds the target and they win the game.’ When asked if Suarez was the difference, Jagielka replied: ‘The pass for the first goal was pretty decent. It was a similar story to the other night. We played pretty well at times but in the end we were not good enough. Up against the best: Jagielka wins this battle with Suarez but England's defence twice conceded to him . Heads, you lose: Suarez comes out on the losing side of this aerial duel with the Everton centre back . ‘It’s very disappointing. The last thing you want to see as a defender is a punt down the pitch and then a flick on and a goal. We are absolutely devastated in there. We had them on the back foot. We just couldn’t get the second goal. ‘There is a small chance I suppose (of Italy winning their next two games) but we are not exactly expecting anything like that to happen. We have got to go out there, put a good performance in and make sure we get something against Costa Rica.’ Double trouble: It wasn't just Suarez the England defence had to worry about, Edinson Cavani was there too .","England centre back believes Roy Hodgson's side played well in spells .

"By . Dominic King . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . They are the dark horses for World Cup glory, a country that is blessed with strength in depth and will pose a threat to all. So deep is the talent in Belgium’s 23-man party that it has prompted Roberto Martinez, Everton’s studious manager, to go as far as saying they have the best all-round squad of the 32 nations that have travelled to Brazil this summer. Having limbered up for the World Cup with three comfortable victories against Luxembourg, Sweden and Tunisia, it would take a brave man to bet against the Group H favourites but Kevin Mirallas insists Belgium’s best days will be in front of them, regardless of what happens over the next month. VIDEO Scroll down to see Hazard and Lukaku in their downtime with the Belgium squad . Addressing the press: Kevin Mirallas answers questions during a press conference on Thursday . If conquering the world proves beyond Marc Wilmots’ progressive squad, dominating the continent is firmly on the agenda. The European Championships, which will be staged in France two years from now, and Mirallas has warned that is when Belgium will be at their peak. ‘Everyone is thinking that we are going to have an absolutely magical experience in Brazil and for us as players it is going to be special but we remain very focused on our goal,’ said Mirallas, who will provide stealth from the flank when Belgium begin their campaign against Algeria in Belo Horizonte. ‘The one thing we can definitely say is that we will be stronger for Euro 2016. We will be better for this experience of the World Cup. But there is a huge amount of expectation on us for Brazil and with that comes pressure. ‘We lost two recent friendlies at home  after we had qualified for the World Cup (0-2 v Columbia, 2-3 v Japan) and received loads of criticism afterwards. That doesn't sit well with you. We will be better for the World Cup experience though and we’ll be stronger again for the European Championships.’ Tuning up: Mirallas plays for Belgium in the final warm-up match against Tunisia in Brussels last Saturday . There is a reason so much is expected of Belgium. The collective value of their squad would run beyond £200million and many of their key figures, such as Eden Hazard, Adnan Januzaj, Vincent Kompany and Romelu Lukaku, have been thriving in the Barclays Premier League. Wilmots has such faith in a pool dubbed ‘The Golden Generation’ he recently extended his contract until 2018. With expectation, however, comes pressure and Mirallas believes a lack of tournament experience could prove crucial – this is the first time Belgium have played at a World Cup since underwhelming in 2002 and only veteran defender Daniel van Buyten remains from that squad. All set: Coach Marc Wilmots watches Adnan Januzaj in Belgium's final training session in Brussels last Sunday . ‘A lot of the talk back home is that we've got an easy group and we'll easily progress but we are keeping our feet very much on the ground,’ said Mirallas, who is now fully fit after missing the end of Everton’s season because of a groin problem. ‘All we are concentrating on at the moment is getting out of the group because it won't be easy. You have to consider we are a young group and only van Buyten has played in a World Cup.  You have to be honest and say that experience is important in these tournaments. We can't get carried away.’ Team shot: Belgium's players line up for a squad photograph ahead of the World Cup in Brazil this summer .","Belgium are considered as one of the dark horses for World Cup glory .

"By . Rafael Benitez . Napoli and former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez, a Sportsmail World Cup columnist, gives his take on the key players as England prepare to take on Italy in their Group D opener in Manaus. ITALY . GIANLUIGI BUFFON . This may be his fifth World Cup but you can see he still has excellent quality with his hands and feet. He keeps his defence calm and his experience wins Italy games. A great character and good example for everyone  to follow. Shot stopper: Gianluigi Buffon is a fine example to follow, at the age of 36, he organises the defence well . MARCO VERRATTI . He may be small but don’t be fooled he is strong. A dynamic midfielder with great intelligence, Italians have questioned if he can play in the same team as Pirlo and a slight injury may prompt Prandelli to favour Claudio Marchisio. Stylish: But Marco Verratti may not get in the same team as charismatic playmaker Andrea Pirlo . ANTONIO CASSANO . Very clever player who can make the difference in tight games. May come on from the bench but understands the game well and gets into positions to cause danger. Has lost weight after cutting back on focaccia but still strong. Key sub? Antonio Cassano can make an impact off the bench in crucial games . MARIO BALOTELLI . Not had the best season but it’s always the same with him; he has great qualities and if he concentrates on his football he can be excellent.  May be used by Prandelli as a target man to help give Italy’s midfield the control. Not the best season: But Mario Ballotelli can turn any game on its head . CIRO IMMOBILE . Has just moved to Dortmund for £15m. A confident character and real worker who will chase lost causes and won’t let any defence rest. Scored 22 goals last season and could play as a lone striker or in partnership with Balotelli. Poacher: Serie A top scorer and new Dortmund striker Ciro Immobile could link up with Balotelli . ENGLAND . GARY CAHILL . We could see his potential at Chelsea. Has a great attitude, is willing to listen and has good feet. Champions League experience will give him confidence and he can be an aerial threat. Potential fulfilled: Gary Cahill is a fine listener and has two great feet at the back . ROSS BARKLEY . His movement is very good. The main thing is how players like him grow; how they manage the expectation from fans and press talking about how great they are. He finds good positions but has to be careful in possession. No fear: Ross Barkley's movement in behind the striker could mean an influential impact . RAHEEM STERLING . I remember Liverpool’s academy director Frank McParland came to me and said ‘we MUST sign this kid he has great potential’. Normally you pay around £200,000 for teenage players but we had to pay more. He has grown with games. Confidence, ability and pace are his main attributes and when you have confidence you do the right things. Has the ability to start but could be very influential off the bench against a tired defence. Teen at the time: But Benitez signed Raheem Sterling at Liverpool for a hefty fee . ADAM LALLANA . You can see he has a lot of talent. He has improved a lot and looks comfortable on the international stage. His quality on the ball and invention give England something different and his movement can keep Italy thinking. Improvement: Southampton midfielder Adam Lallana has relished the step up in class with England . DANIEL STURRIDGE . People in Italy know Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard but this season they have taken notice of Sturridge and what he has done alongside Luis Suarez. He has confidence, belief and pace — that is a vital combination for a striker. Worth a watch: Italy has noted Daniel Sturridge's performances for Liverpool this season .","Gianluigi Buffon is an outstanding communicator from the back .

As the roads of the north-east coastal city ran two feet deep in water after overnight rain, journalists on a media bus battling through the torrents to reach the Arena Pernambuco took photographs and shot video of the chaos. It was only after a few moments that it became clear that some of the townsfolk – clinging to lamp posts and traffic islands to keep dry – were taking photos right back. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Adidas customise World Cup footballs ahead of quarter finals . Spectacle: The atmosphere at the stadia in Brazil has been impressive . To many – probably most – Brazilians, this World Cup is a curiosity, something that has simply been going on around them. There are not many local black faces in the stadia on match day. World Cup 2014 has out priced vast swathes of its host nation but we shouldn't be surprised and it is not alone. This is the way in modern sport.  Go on to a council estate in London and ask people how many of them have tickets for the next Six Nations and you will get my point. It was the same in South Africa in 2010 and will be the same in Russia in 2018. The World Cup has long since been an event for tourists and televisions. If you own a hotel or restaurant in Brazil then you will have won over the last three weeks. If you live in one of the scruffy narrow streets that branch off the new four lane highway that runs up to the Estadio Castelao  in Fortaleza then forget it. This World Cup – like all the others – has been nothing more than a procession passing by your window. Eye-catching: There has been 154 goals scored at the World Cup so far . As a model for social equality, then, this World Cup has achieved little. As a sporting event, however, it has passed its test comfortably and – thanks to the beauty of the football – spectacularly. This, remember, was supposed to be the World Cup that wouldn't work. It was to be the tournament where stadia weren't ready, where the infrastructure wouldn't cope and where visiting football fans would lose their wallets and mobile 'phones. They said all this before South Africa, of course, and, just as it didn't happen then, it hasn't happened here. There is a firmly held belief here in Brazil that things are better when left to the last minute. It's reflected in the haphazard nature of the service industry. If you want your bar meal by full-time, then you are really better off ordering it before kick-off. Certainly, that has been reflected in the way that the stadia, airports and hotels dragged themselves in to shape just in time. Those who visited Brazil in April returned with horror stories of unfinished airport terminals, half-completed roads and stadia without roofs on. But while it hasn't been perfect, it has certainly worked. Success: Sepp Blatter has been kept in the background by events on the pitch . While you wouldn't wish to get to the airport in Natal in a hurry – the shiny new road from the terminal gives way to cobbles and potholes after about a mile – or reach the stadium in Recife in time for a pre-match sandwich, these have been the exceptions. The airports here would certainly shame Heathrow in Manchester and while some hotels haven't been places in which you wish to linger for post-dinner drink it must be remembered that Brazil remains, in essence, an extremely poor country. Those who have followed their teams across this vast landscape will have returned home exhausted, penniless and with more air miles than Richard Branson. Brazil doesn't do trains. That, however, is FIFA's issue and, happily, it is one they seem set to address in time for Russia 2018 where we will return to the old system of basing each group in one city. That way, supporters won't get to see as much of Russia but will also mean a World Cup holiday won't require a second mortgage. FIFA, of course, will make a fortune out of this tournament.  Ticket prices are far too high and some FIFA-recommended hotels profit from the uncertainty of the knockout stages by charging last-minute visitors rates to make the eyes water. More than £800 for two nights at the Fortaleza Holiday Inn, anyone? It is indicative, though, of a successful tournament that FIFA president Sepp Blatter has hardly been mentioned since this one started. When the football is good, and the World Cup ticks along without undue drama, all the rest just becomes a sideshow. My World Cup so far totals twelve matches, 16 flights and – most importantly – 36 goals. That's a spectacular return in keeping with the overall figure of 154 goals so far. The atmosphere in the stadia has far outstripped that of South Africa, thanks largely to vastly increased numbers of visiting fans from competing nations. And the really good news? There are still eight games to go.","World Cup 2014 has out priced vast swathes of its host nation .

"By . John Drayton . Georgios Samaras spoke of his pride after scoring the dramatic late penalty that sent Greece into the last 16 of the World Cup in Brazil. The former Celtic striker coolly converted from the spot in injury time in Fortaleza to hand his side a 2-1 win over Ivory Coast and second place in Group C. The Africans had looked like going through to the knockout stage after Swansea’s Wilfried Bony cancelled out an Andreas Samaris strike, but Greece - who hit the woodwork three times - earned late reward for a positive display. VIDEO Greece shock Ivory Coast to reach last 16 . On his knees: Georgios Samaras rejoices after firing Greece into the round of 16 . Mobbed: Greece players run to Samaras after the striker fired the side into the knockout stages for the first time . Samaras, released by Celtic at the end of last season, was tripped by Giovanni Sio in the area in the closing moments and got up to apply the finishing touch. Samaras, whose goal was his first at international level for two years, told BBC Sport: 'I think we controlled the game most of the time. I don’t think Ivory Coast created a lot of chances. From our side I think we scored a goal, hit the post three times and at the end we scored a goal. 'We tried the last 15-20 minutes to win because we knew if we won we would be in the next round. 'We gave everything we had and in the end the gods and the luck were on our side. We are really proud of our achievement. I am really proud of the result and our team. I hope we gave a smile back to the people in our country.'","Andreas Samaris hit the Greeks ahead before Wilfried Bony equalised .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Romanian crime syndicates are flooding London with hundreds of pickpockets, prostitutes and beggars ahead of the Olympics. Coachloads of penniless migrants are arriving in the capital every day, many already armed with maps directing them to the best patches, which they have been ordered to defend from rivals. Council workers are already having to clear around 60 Romanian nationals sleeping rough on the streets around Marble Arch and Oxford Street every night and they fear the situation is getting worse. Influx: A group of Romanians is pictured near Marble Arch earlier this . month. Dozens more are arriving by the day as criminal gangs seek to . cash in on the London Olympics . Police recently discovered 50 women believed to have been trafficked into the area to work as prostitutes and arrested four female beggars using babies as young as three weeks old. Westminster crime reduction officer Claire Hardy said the foreign crooks were being allocated patches prior to leaving their country. She told the Daily Express: 'We suspect that we may be witnessing the first pro-active entrepreneurial endeavours by organised criminal enterprise ahead of the Olympics.' Police have seen a steady increase in the activity of Romanian criminal syndicates since the country joined the EU in 2007. The tightly knit gangs are believed to be behind nine in ten cashpoint robberies in the capital netting over £30million a year. Much of the money is funneled back into Romania where gangsters can live a life of luxury on their criminal profits. Organised crime: Police recently arrested four female beggars using babies as young as three weeks old (file picture) Nickie Aiken, Westminster Council’s cabinet member for community protection, said officials were struggling to cope with the increasing numbers of migrants arriving by the day. She told the paper: 'We have always had an issue with eastern Europeans coming here. But the last three weeks have seen them coming in an intensity we have never witnessed before. 'We haven’t got the resources to deal with this. We give them tickets back to Romania but it’s like a revolving door. 'They have the right to enter the country. They could stop in Germany or France but they come here because we have the reputation of providing benefits and accommodation.

"Donkey attacks: Tourists have been approached by animals looking for food during their holidays . Tourists have been warned not to feed donkeys in the New . Forest after after a young girl was bitten a day after a nurse was chased and attacked by one. Holidaymakers visiting a beauty spot in the Hampshire forest have reported being pestered by the animals looking for food. A 12-year-old girl was nipped as she ran past a man who was being pestered for food by two donkeys at Hatchet Pond near Beaulieu. Bystanders said the girl screamed and told her father she was bitten by donkeys but was not seriously hurt. A . day earlier nurse Jenny Caine was another unfortunate victim and . dropped her five-year-old daughter Isabelle after being bitten on her . back and knocked to the ground. The pair were visiting the same area when they were surrounded by five donkeys as they fed bread to ducks. Miss Caine, 38, of New Milton, Hampshire, ran away when she was attacked by throwing the bread in the other direction. She said: ‘We hadn't even got to the water's edge when two donkeys came over and started being a bit of nuisance. ‘Then three others appeared and made a circle around us. I tried to shoo the donkeys away, but . they kept getting close - nudging me and almost physically moving me . away from my vehicle.’ Hungry donkeys: Holidaymakers visiting Hatchet Pond near Beaulieu were attacked while feeding the ducks . She added: ‘Isabelle was getting hysterical, crying and screaming. ‘I . got up and called for help. I wasn't expecting anyone to put themselves . at risk but they could have distracted the donkeys or tried to shoo . them away. ‘I was really angry that no-one did anything. Eventually someone got out of their car and told me to throw my bag of bread in her direction, which I did. ‘The donkeys dispersed and I made a run for it. I was terrified.’ The . Verderers, the organisation in charge of Forest stock, said people . feeding ponies and donkeys could result in them becoming aggressive and . ‘demanding’ food. Random attacks: Donkeys may look sweet but be warned they do have a nasty bite . Be careful: Roaming donkeys have been approaching tourists in the New Forest area . They have urged people to refrain from feeding the animals and have asked the Forestry Commission rangers to assist them in enforcing the rule at Hatchet Pond. Spokeswoman Sue Westwood said: ‘As far as I'm aware we have had two incidents now and they are very close together, which is unfortunate. ‘I can't recall any previous incident involving someone in that sort of situation being knocked over by a pony or a donkey. ‘The woman involved was very unlucky.’","Youngster nipped while visiting Hatchet Pond near Beaulieu .

UK holidaymakers don’t even make the top 10 when it comes to looking for value-for-money trips, with just two fifths searching for seasonal deals prior to booking an escape. Data compiled by travel firm Expedia indicates it is the Asian nations and Mexicans who are leading the deal-hunting pack. Brits abroad: But UK holidaymakers are missing out on the best offers to Asian and Latin America deal hunters . Just 43 per cent of Brits look for flight deals, in comparison to 49 per cent in Spain, 45 per cent in Austria, 53 per cent in Norway, 47 per cent in Denmark, 65 per cent in Ireland and 44 per cent in Italy. Similarly, when booking all inclusive hotels with meal plans, only 30 per cent of Brits do, compared to 38 per cent of Germans, 41 per cent of Italians, 32 per cent of French, 37 per cent of Spaniards and 40 per cent of Austrians. On the plus side, this means Brits have a host of money saving options to wise up to in the future.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . The Hotel Carter famously won TripAdvisor's 'dirtiest hotel in America' award three times in a year, but now there are buyers bidding to snap up the New York accommodation with the price expected to reach $180million (£107million). The 600-room hotel, just off Times Square on West 43rd Street, has had bug infestations, was the site of a murder in 2007 and has violated 15 building codes from uncharged fire extinguishers and exit signs that don't light up to lifts that were overdue for inspection. Lawrence Wolfe, who has been handling the sale, told NBC News: 'It's the dirtiest, and best located hotel in New York City. It was under-managed and neglected.' Key location: The Hotel Carter is expected to sell for £107million, despite its questionable reputation for cleanliness . In need of an upgrade: The bathrooms were pictured with stains and mould when the Hotel Carter won the 'Dirtiest hotel in America' title for the third time in 2009 . First opened in the 1930s as the Hotel Dixie, it was famed as an affordable New York location, but in recent years the two-star accommodation had insect infestations, bed bugs and even used discarded hospital linens for its bedding. In 2007, a woman in her 20s was found dead in room 608, with her head and legs wrapped in plastic bags. She had been strangled. Tran Dinh Truong owned the hotel from 1977 but died in 2012, which prompted a temporary administrator to step in while it was decided what to do with the property. John J. Cruz, from GF Management, took over with 15 building code violations in various stages of being addressed, rooms cost $99 (£59) a night with the bizarre tag-line 'You Wanted in Time Square & Less' Room for the night: The Hotel Carter has more than 600 rooms of varying quality . Prime position: The hotel will sell for £107million for its location in New York, but will need a £75million upgrade . A total of 25 bidders were interested in the hotel, but it has now been narrowed to a final few and the property is expected to sell for around $180million (£107million), with the buyer committing to a full renovation at a cost of $100-125million (£60-75million). Mr Wolfe has confirmed the hotel will remain independent. The hotel last scooped the 'dirtiest' award from TripAdvisor in 2009, but the awards were scrapped altogether in 2012. However, customers have left mixed comments on the review website, with more than one thousands rating it as 'terrible'. Ahmed M left the comment: 'The hotel is less than 5 minutes away from Times Square. So I don't think anyone could complain about its location. The rooms however were somewhat filthy. I've stayed in a lot of motels throughout the US, with much higher hygiene levels. The floors were dirty and the bathtub stained.' Connoramy described the hotel as: 'Absolutely vile! Unsafe, nasty and falling down!' However, over the past year the reviews have been improving, with many stating that although the hotel was out of date, for the location and price they couldn't complain.","Located in key position just off Times Square in New York .

"By . Camilla Canocchi . Long awaited summer holidays are here and they might not just bring relaxation and sun – they might bring you long-term love, too. And if it doesn’t turn out to be the love of your life, don’t despair - there are high chances for some romantic fun. More than one in four Britons (26 per cent) said they had a holiday romance or flirtatious experience with a stranger at least once during their life while on holiday, according to new statistics. Love is in the air: More than one in four Britons said they had a holiday romance or flirtatious experience with a stranger at least once while on holiday . And some 11 per cent of them ended up getting married with that stranger, and still are, while four per cent said they met their former spouse on vacation, travel search site momondo has found. Unsurprisingly, the majority of Britons (64 per cent) feel happier and more positive when they are not working and lying on a beach somewhere and 24 per cent become more social too, upping their chances of meeting someone. Increased sociability even translates to the bedroom for some, with many Brits stating they have an increased desire for sex on holiday. And this goes for 19 per cent of men and 14 per cent of women. ‘When people go off on their holidays they often turn off “work mode” and start enjoying life – smiling more, being more adventurous and generally feeling happy. When people are happy on the inside, they project this outwardly and, in return people are attracted to them. Not just a flirt: Some 11 per cent of those who had a holiday romance ended up married - and still are - momondo said . 'It’s no wonder more and more people are finding romance on holiday – it’s when we are at our best and projecting the very best image of ourselves,’ says romance expert Tiffany Wright. Romance or not, meeting new people while travelling is the essential ingredient for a good holiday for 23 per cent of Brits, the survey of 1,000 people has found. ‘Many single people who head on holiday do so in the hope they might have their ""Shirley Valentine"" moment and find the love of their lives.  Perhaps they start to dress more attractively? After all, everyone knows how romantic and exciting a holiday romance can be? And what better place to find love than in paradise?’ says Wright. And after months of hard work, nearly half of Britons say they feel a holiday is good for their health. Spokesperson at momondo, Julie Pedersen, said it is important for many Brits to relax whilst away, and as a result meeting new people can play a significant role. ‘When we book a trip to another country, we automatically open our minds to new experiences. These may come by visiting different places, or indeed via meeting new people, within these places. ‘Free from the humdrum of life back home, we take more time to savour the moment on holiday, drinking in the destination, and chatting to fellow travellers or locals alike. It fits then, that romantic encounters may follow if both parties are in the mood! These can form great holiday memories or even for some long-term partnerships.’","26% of Britons have a holiday romance at least once in their life .

"By . Sarah Gordon . A disability charity is taking Disneyland to court, accusing it of 'intolerable acts against people with learning difficulties.' The National Union of Charities for Parents with Disabled Children (UNAPEI), has lodged a legal complaint, accusing Disneyland of 'institutional discrimination'. The French organisaton accused Disneyland Paris of using controversial practices, equivalent to racial profiling, to identify visitors with learning difficulties. Discrimination: The charity says Mickey Mouse is treating people with learning difficulties like they are crazy . The charity says those visitors are forced to identify themselves as 'disabled visitors' and are denied access to certain attractions, sometimes being pulled out of queues by workers in front of other tourists. Christel Prado, president of Unapei, told Le Parisien newspaper: 'It’s humiliating. Mickey Mouse treats us like we are crazy'. As well as labelling the visitors as 'disabled', the park also bans them from using rides together, making their guardian take one person on the ride at a time, meaning they have to queue multiple times when travelling as a group. 'Intolerable': The French charity says Disneyland employs methods similar to racial profiling . Defence: The park claims it takes the necessary precautions to keep all visitors safe in the event of a problem . The 'priority pass' issued to tourists with learning difficulties means they have to follow a different set of rules- something with Unapei argues doesn't happen in other parks. However the park, which trades on being a place 'where dreams come true', has launched a robust defence of its policies, saying it welcomes 60,000 customers with disabilities every year. A statement from Disneyland Paris said: 'We are very attentive on this subject. We have to above all ensure their safety. If the ride is blocked in the dark, if there is panic, then the rescuers need to know straight away where they are.' When asked about forcing visitors with learning difficulties to identify themselves as 'disabled', the park responded to Le Parisien: 'It is for their own good. Although we have noticed that more and more disabled people do not want to signal this.'","French charity accuses Disneyland Paris of similar practices to racial profiling .

"By . Beci Wood . Visitors to France face travel chaos this week as air traffic controllers stage a nationwide strike starting from tomorrow - just days after industrial action by railway workers across the country. SNCTA and Unsa-ICNA, the two biggest air traffic control unions, have warned passengers of 'heavy disruption' just as the holiday season gets into swing. However they will have to wait until the 11th hour to find out whether they are definitely affected. Braced for chaos: Airline passengers travelling to and from France this week might have their flights cancelled or delayed . Airlines have offered preliminary advice to passengers but with less than 24 hours to go they are unable to confirm which flights are cancelled. Estimates have put the number of expected cancellations this week as high as 50 per cent, but there are claims that even this is a conservative estimate. There will also be massive delays at all French airports, as the entire air system is affected by the walk-outs, which will last from Tuesday until Sunday, June 29. Around 350 direct flights are currently scheduled between the UK and France during the planned strike period. British . budget carrier easyJet, which operates from 14 airports in France, said they expect 50 per cent of its flights will be cancelled. A spokeswoman for the airline said: 'EasyJet . is disappointed at this unnecessary strike action which has the . potential to cause considerable disruption and cancellations for . passengers and airlines across Europe. 'Despite . the fact that this disruption is beyond easyJet’s control we will do . everything possible to minimise the inconvenience to our customers. 'As . the scale of the disruption becomes clearer we will proactively provide . advice for our passengers through our website, text messages and flight . tracker tool.' Air France said it hopes its long-haul flights run as normal but is not able to provide information about short and medium-haul journeys until later today. EasyJet: Budget British airline has told passengers that approximately 50 per cent of flights will be cancelled . British . Airways hopes to reduce the backlog by switching to larger aircraft on . some routes but said it could not finalise plans until the number of . cancellations ordered by France’s Directorate General for Civil Aviation . (DGAC) was clear. BA, . which operates 30 return flights a day between Britain and France, . said: 'The level of disruption is likely to fluctuate in different parts . of France at different parts of each day. 'Unfortunately . this industrial action is also highly likely to lead to delays on other . short-haul services which have to overfly France.' Ryanair is expected to make decisions about routes later today. French travel turmoil: Air traffic controllers join rail workers in a nationwide strike . A spokesman added: 'We are assessing the situation and are not yet certain of the level of disruption expected, but will advise our customers once we have further information.' The action has been timed ahead of a deadline on June 30 for France to present its five-year budget plans for aviation to Brussels. More than 60 per cent of France's 4,000 air traffic controllers have voted in favour of the protest against government aviation cuts. They said that the controversial measures, which will be implemented between 2015 and 2019, will lead to a cheaper, less efficient system, and threaten 'modernisation'. In turn, Mr Hollande's government insists that the cuts simply comply with European Commission plans to reduce air navigation costs. Bigger jets: British Airways are considering using larger aircraft to ease travel nightmare . The Commission wants to divide the continent's airspace into functional blocks according to traffic flows, rather than national borders. An estimated 17.1 million Brits travel to France each year, mostly during the summer months. French retail workers are also set to strike, meaning that famous Paris department stores including Galeries Lafayette and Printemps will be shut down to those who do make it across the Channel. This industrial action is in protest at Foreign Minister Larent Fabius's decision to introduce Sunday opening hours to boost tourism - a measure the CLIC-P union argues will have 'no economic benefit' and will instead destroy an established day of rest. Developments in France come at the same time as the UK Passport Office fiasco, which has led to Home Secretary Theresa May promising a free fast-track service to people with an 'urgent' need to travel.","Passengers warned of 'heavy disruption to all flights'

"By . Lisa Sewards . My knees ache, my legs are in a tangle, and every inch of my untoned body feels as if it has been put through a vigorous exercise routine. I am a shadow of my usual self — which for the past hour is literally what I have been. I have been practising with the shadow dancers from Attraction, the troupe whose stunningly clever silhouettes have made them the bookies’ favourite at odds of 11/10 to win this year’s Britain’s Got Talent. Thirteen million viewers watched them storm through their audition on the first night of the current series and many were left, like Amanda Holden, in tears at their poignant act. Scroll down for video . Casting shadows: Lisa (left) recreates the mother and baby scene against a London backdrop . Set against a backdrop of familiar British landmarks — created by the carefully contorted bodies of the shadow dancers — it began with a couple meeting, marrying and having a baby, all seen on a screen lit from behind. But the tale turned darker than its shadows when the soldier husband is killed in Afghanistan and the dancers turned themselves into a camel, palm trees, an enemy sniper and, finally, a cemetery. It’s all down to firmly shaped bodies and exact positioning, explains Attraction’s founder and choreographer Zoltan Szucs. He uses a simple back light to project shadows of the dancers’ bodies on to the screen to form seemingly impossible images and scenery in an emotional storyboard set to music. The performance stunned the judges and brought the panel and entire theatre audience to its feet. In the past month, Attraction’s audition has captured a further 17 million hits on YouTube. Which is why I find myself firmly contained in an unforgiving Lycra unitard, nervously waiting to rehearse with the now world-famous Hungarian troupe who have flown into London early so I can join them for a practice session before their appearance in this week’s live semi-finals, and see exactly how it’s done. ‘A mere millimetre out of place can change an entire shape. It’s all down to the distance between the light and the screen, which can shrink or magnify a body,’ says Zoltan. About 13million people tuned to watch them in their first audition on Britain's Got Talent . I soon discover what he means as I watch the team re-enact the story that has captured the nation. Then I am asked to recreate the scenes taking the part of the young wife and mother who is widowed after her husband flies to Afghanistan. We start at Tower Bridge — created by three rows of dancers — and I am linked with dancer Csba to create the shadow of the couple holding hands. My arms have to remain still and twisted otherwise they create a grotesque Beauty and the Beast image, with me as the Beast. Creating the shadow is all about precision and aligning with the beam of light from the projector, which is important when I portray the bride in the London taxi scene, passing the Gherkin and the London Eye. I have to kneel while stretching and straining both forwards and upwards to have any hope of getting my shadow anywhere near that of my taller bridegroom Csba. But although my knees are feeling the pain, I have to keep still and smile to create the harmony between music, visual performance and body control. ‘I choose the song first and after I create the dance,’ says Zoltan. In this case the song chosen is Emeli Sande’s Read All About It and before I know it it’s time for me to start a family, and  I am gently handed a doll while other dancers twist themselves to create the image of a pram standing in front of Big Ben. Creating the shadow, seen here on the show, is all about precision and aligning the beam of light . ‘This is Sam,’ says Zoltan. ‘Treat him tenderly. Look and smile at him and hold him like a real baby, supporting his neck.’ Rocking Sam up and down, while tucking in his toes to keep the line of the shadow smooth, lifting his hand with my fingers and smiling at him to show real emotion is hard when all I can think is one false move against the projector will make me look like a still-expectant mother. Sam and I are the only ones allowed to sport free-flowing hair, while the other dancers must wear swimming caps to keep their shadow lines smooth. As I look down there is one dancer on the floor below me who is creating the pram hood shadow, curving her arm around her head while balancing on the backs of two men who form the wheels. My strength is failing as I wobble while trying to balance Sam and hold the position. My husband leaves for Afghanistan, and I go from dutiful wife and mother to acting out the local scenery. Zoltan bends me into the palm tree position, angling my arms to create the arched branch. And with one twist of the head, my arm is magnified from a branch to a chunky tree trunk, while my fingers morph from delicate palm leaf fronds to fat lily pads. There is laughter from the camel and from the other dancers viewing the shadow in front of the screen. Zoltan bends me back into shape, lifting my arm high to resemble a spout while pushing my nose into my armpit. All the shapes such as this palm tree and camel are creating by contorting the bodies of the dancers . Holding the pose is agony and I can feel my head slowly drooping towards the floor. ‘Keep your head up — it is supposed to represent a coconut,’ says Zoltan. No body part can be allowed to stray, otherwise the entire shadow collapses. This is why the eight dancers have to train 11 hours nearly every day, perfecting their flexibility as well as concentration. ‘This is very hard work — you need physical and mental stamina and that’s why we practice long hours to achieve it,’ warns Zoltan. ‘Accidents can easily happen when we’re standing on each others’ backs. We have daily physiotherapy and sports massages to prevent injuries.’ Shadow dancing has its origins in China, some 300 years ago. Zoltan, 40, an award-winning breakdancer, founded Attraction in 2004 as part of Hungary’s Black Lights Theatre group. He runs it with his wife Eva, who is the troupe’s manager — as well as mother to the couple’s two sons. The key to keeping the shapes is down to team work, says  Eva, 39. ‘We tell our dancers there is no room for  ego because the connection to others is vital. This group has been together for three years. But if we bring in someone new, everyone has to decide if they fit in. If not, they’re told to go.’ Attraction tackle poignant subject matter in their shadow act . Eva, whose sons are aged ten and seven, takes care of all the dancers’ needs. ‘This is our second family. I am like a mother to the dancers who are mostly in their teens and early 20s.’ They had taken part in the Hungarian and German shows based on Britain’s Got Talent doing their normal Black Lights Theatre act — where the illusions required a completely dark theatre, ultraviolet lighting and fluorescent costumes. At one moment, performers were invisible; in the next, they appeared to be floating in the air — but made little impact. So Zoltan changed tack with shadow dancing, debuting as guest performers on Hungary’s Dancing With The Stars in 2008. When they learned Britain’s Got Talent was open to European acts they sent a video of their performance to the show’s producers and were invited to audition in Birmingham. It proved to be the international breakthrough they were waiting for — and the troupe are determined to capitalise on it. In their rehearsal studio, Attraction usually create their shadows with just one lamp and no projector. Zoltan says: ‘It keeps costs down, but for Britain’s Got Talent we have rented a projector. Every time we use a projector, we have to customise all the shapes and distances as each one creates a different effect. So we have to spend time working out the perfect position to ensure it throws all the shadows precisely.’ When the troupe learned the show was open to European acts they sent an audition tape to the UK . Thousands of tiny fluorescent stickers are dotted over the soft dance mat, each colour representing the foot and hand positioning for each shadow for every dancer. Although all the performers are a mix of ballet, modern, hip-hop and street dancers, Zoltan says the moves are easy for the troupe to master. ‘The real work is having the core strength to hold the shapes and also to work with the projector with precision,’ he says. The hardest shadow for the troupe is their ‘big face’. Everyone is needed for this shape but I am spared the indignity of piggybacking and bending into someone’s bottom to create a chin. Instead, I wiggle my fingers to create fluttering eyelashes. Zoltan says: ‘We can create bigger shapes with more people but we are only eight and have no reserves, so we have to be very careful no one gets injured, because having got this far on Britain’s Got Talent, it would be a huge disappointment if our performance was spoiled.’ There have been complaints on Twitter that European artists are being allowed to compete in a British show. But they have Simon Cowell’s support. He says: ‘We are part of Europe; it’s flattering they fly all this way to enter the show. It means our Brits have got to step up.’ Attraction’s ultimate dream is to win and perform for The Queen. ‘We hope we are popular and would like to go through to the final as we want to thank the British people. But we are also realistic. The most important thing to us is that we feel we’ve already won because Britain’s Got Talent has put Attraction on the worldwide map,’ says Eva.","Shadow dance troupe Attraction are 11/10 favourites to win the competition .

"By . Chris Hastings . A descendant of Charles Dickens has welcomed a new film laying bare the secrets of novelist’s affair with a young actress who gave birth to his secret son. The Invisible Woman portrays the breakdown of Dickens’s marriage to wife Catherine and his obsession with actress Ellen Ternan, whom many believe inspired Estella in Great Expectations. Dickens, played by Ralph Fiennes, was 45 at the start of the affair and Ternan, who is played by Felicity Jones, was just 18. The pair are said to have had a son who died at birth. Secret affair: Charles Dickens, left, played by Ralph Fiennes, is shown in a passionate meeting with actress Ellen Ternan, played by Felicity Jones . Lucinda Hawksley, a historian who is a great-great-great granddaughter of Dickens, said: ‘I think a lot of what is depicted in the film is based on fact. ‘I absolutely do believe Ellen gave birth to Dickens’s child, though  I know some academics have disputed this. I really liked the film.’ In scenes likely to shock fans, the author taunts his wife about the affair. Later he forces his wife, played by Joanna Scanlan, to deliver a  piece of jewellery to his mistress after it has been sent to her by mistake. The film is based on a biography of the same name by Claire Tomalin, who advised on the making of the film. She said Fiennes was ‘born to play Dickens’. Obsession: Ms Hawksley said she 'absolutely' believes that Miss Ternan, shown above in the film, bore Dickens's illegitimate child .","The Invisible Woman will detail author's affair with actress Ellen Ternan .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . Theft: The leather bag belonged to Lucy Watson, pictured, who was distracted at the time by lovelorn suitor Jamie Laing . For once, the young and privileged stars of Made in Chelsea have something more serious to think about than gossip and back stabbing. In a twist as melodramatic as any of the reality show’s plots, police are investigating the theft of cash from a Prada bag belonging to one of the rich socialites. Bizarrely, a pink thong was also taken, along with a driving licence. Police were called in after the theft, which occurred in a supposedly secure area of the set. In classic whodunnit style, officers now want to speak to cast members to find out if they saw anything  suspicious during the filming of a champagne-soaked Christmas special at a country mansion. The grey leather bag in question belonged to Lucy Watson, who was distracted at the time of the theft by lovelorn suitor Jamie Laing as he attempted to sweep her off her feet in a horse-drawn carriage. Most of the show’s stars are said to have been gathered on the steps of Botleys Mansion in Chertsey, Surrey, for the grand gesture at the time of the theft. Programme maker Channel 4 is investigating the incident on the show, which follows a group of wealthy friends. In scenes filmed days earlier in London’s Chelsea, Miss Watson had a spat with designer Victoria Baker-Harber in which they called each other ‘prostitutes’. The row continued at the country house, with Miss Baker-Harber, 25, launching a foul-mouthed tirade at Miss Watson, 22. Awkward silence fell – until Miss Watson was called away to meet Mr Laing, the 25-year-old heir to the McVitie’s biscuit fortune. Surprise: Lucy Watson was surprised by her lovelorn suitor Jamie Laing (right) when he pulled up in a horse-drawn carriage at Botleys Mansion in Chertsey, Surrey during the dramatic Christmas special . Hooray: The rest of the cast applauded as the two were led away after a string of insults were traded . Feast: The whole team had a Christmas banquet but the episode ended with a handbag being stolen . A friend of Miss Watson said she noticed things missing soon afterwards as her bag’s zip was left open. The source said: ‘Lucy was furious. For her money and her driving licence to go missing was bad enough, but she felt absolutely violated that her thong was taken as well. ‘She doesn’t know who stole the items, but she reported it to the police the next day. It’s a closed set so obviously there are not going to be many people about other than cast and crew. If you told me this had happened on The Only Way is Essex I would have believed it more than Made in Chelsea.’ It is thought police will speak to Miss Baker-Harber and her friend Sophie Hermann, who did not join the cast for the carriage scene. Grinch: Victoria Baker-Harber laid into co-star Cheska Hull at dinner, calling her a f***ing fat turkey . Angry: Cheska, left, sat dumbfounded while she was insulted at the Christmas dinner - but the episode's filming ended with a worse outcome than just gossip after Lucy Watson's handbag, cash and thong were stolen . Meanwhile, it appears Mr Laing’s . last-ditch attempt to win Miss Watson over has failed. She split with . him shortly after filming the show, broadcast on Monday. A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘The Made In Chelsea production team take on-set security seriously.’ A Surrey police spokesman said: ‘We are investigating an allegation of theft at an address off Stonehill Road in Chertsey.’","Items including grey leather bag belonged to 22-year-old Lucy Watson .

"By . Hayley Coyle . He was once named one of the world’s sexiest vegetarians. However it is an accolade that is no longer true for Coldplay’s Chris Martin. He revealed yesterday that having ‘consciously uncoupled’ from his marriage to Hollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow he has also relinquished the vegetarian lifestyle that came with it and is now once again a carnivore. The 37 year-old British star let slip about his change in diet during an interview with Steve Wright on Radio 2 yesterday. Scroll down for video . Meat feast: The 37 year-old British star let slip about his change in diet during an interview yesterday . ‘I am not really vegetarian. I eat meat. I was vegetarian for a long time but for various reasons I changed. 'My daughter [Apple, 10] has been a vegetarian since she was born. I keep getting tempted to go back but I don’t eat too much meat.’ Warming to his theme he then bizarrely said: ‘The honest answer why I changed is because I thought you can only eat something that you should be able to kill. 'I don’t why I am talking about this. I have got to stop as there will be some sort of headline. I mean “Could you kill a fish?” I would not like it but I probably could eat the fish...or a giraffe... I have been called the world’s sexiest vegetarian. I don’t think I am the world’s sexiest singer. I think I came about 17th.’ Miss Paltrow’s enthusiasm for following a vegetarian diet is well-documented and she has written a cookbook and blogged about the health benefits of following a diet rich in plants and seeds. The perfect split? Gwyneth and Chris have remained close since their split and are even still living together . And so stringent is her approach to diet she once admitted that her whole family can at times feel hungry because she will not allow them to eat carbohydrates like bread, pasta or white rice. The Iron Man star announced on her Goop lifestyle website in March that she and Martin were ‘consciously uncoupling’ after 10 years. The break up between Miss Paltrow, 41, and the Exeter-born singer, appears to be amicable and the pair have even been spotted out together since looking close and comfortable in each other’s company.’ Miss Paltrow wrote on her website at the time of the announcement that she and Mr Martin had tried in vain to save their marriage for over a year but that they would always be a family and their main concern was the welfare of their children. They also have a son, eight-year-old Moses. When asked how he deals with such a major personal upheaval while performing Mr Martin replied: ‘My job is so uplifting and that naturally is an endorphin. ‘I am very lucky I have some good teachers and good people who have written some great things that make you able to alchemise.’ He also said that music has helped him through other tough times in the past and described his craft as his ‘friend’. Mr Martin said: ‘Music, especially over the last couple of years has been very alchemising. I mean if you are going through something difficult in life or whatever and music for me is always a friend and something that helps me figure things out. ‘At the end of the day that is what I am always doing in the middle of the night. I need my time on my own with it and also like playing.’ Both Mr Martin and Miss Paltrow are involved in charity work and the singer said that for him it stems from his mother always encouraging him to give a portion of his money away. He added: ‘When I first got pocket money as a kid my mum told me I should give 10 per cent away.‘So we just keep doing it. ‘I don’t think that is corny at all. I think it would be amazing if more companies did that. ‘We always work with Kids Company in London and that is mainly what we do behind the scenes. ‘We are a tiny bit involved in Prince Harry’s Invictus charity.

"By . Sara Nathan . Israeli supermodel Bar Refaeli has split with her boyfriend Adi Ezra in a blazing row over Rolling Stones frontman Sir Mick Jagger - ruining her 29th birthday. Bar recently admitted she was serious about Ezra and the couple were pictured on an intimate vacation in Thailand in March. However, Israeli publications reported the couple split after Ezra accused the blonde of dancing too close to notorious womanizer Jagger, 70, with one claiming that he was so furious he grabbed Bar and pulled her off the dance floor at an exclusive Stones party. Scroll down for video . Flirt: Mick Jagger with Israeli supermodel Bar Refaeli in 2013. They met up again last week . Suddenly single? The X Factor Israel host reportedly split with her boyfriend Adi Ezra after he accused Refaeli of dancing too close to Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger at Yarkon Park in Tel Aviv . The couple were then heard having an argument and left the bash separately - and have not spoken since. Bar - who was pictured partying with Jagger last year - and Ezra attended the Stones gig at Yarkon Park in Tel Aviv last Wednesday, celebrating the model's birthday. The pair later joined the band at an exclusive after party at a restaurant called Mr. & Mrs. Lee. But Bar's birthday celebrations soon soured, allegedly fueled by Ezra's jealousy. The Sports Illustrated beauty flew to Los Angeles at the weekend accompanied by her father Rafael, and her youngest brother, On, and the trio were pictured at the Jewish Life Foundation Salute to Hollywood Gala on Sunday. Asked about the split, her mother Zipi Refaeli refused to comment, while Ezra said he did not comment on his personal life. However, Bar - who dated A list star Leonard DiCaprio for four years before their split in May 2011 - made it clear she was serious about Ezra as she posed in wedding dresses for Hello! magazine in May and admitted she could hear wedding bells, saying: 'The wedding of my dreams is very simple, not a lot of people, not in a big place, maybe outdoors, barefoot. 'I'm in a relationship, there's a special guy in my life, we're not talking marriage yet. ''[I . am] a romantic person, but a very solid romantic person.I like basic . things - when somebody tells me he loves me, or when I say, 'I love . you'. I really mean it, I don't just say it, so that's romantic to me. 'I . don't need to go to the beach and have a picnic with wine in a basket . to feel romantic. I feel romantic when I look into my boyfriend's eyes - . that's enough for me.' Meanwhile, . Rocker Jagger has caused his own furore by seeming to be back to his . womanizing ways just 11 weeks after the tragic suicide of his longtime . love, fashion designer L'Wren Scott. Physical: Adi Ezra shows off bruises from a boxing fight as he is joined by Bar in Tel Aviv earlier this year . Serious: Bar Refaeli said she could hear wedding bells for her and Adi Ezra - however, their romance soured on her 29th birthday last Wednesday when Ezra is believed to have dragged her off the dance floor at an exclusive Rolling Stones party following their Tel Aviv gig - accusing her of getting too close to Mick Jagger . Beaming and looking relaxed, he threw his arm around Israeli model Noa Tishby following the Stones Tel Aviv gig. Today, a pal of the singer conceded to the Daily Mail the pair have a flirtatious friendship, but added: ‘They got to know each other in Mustique but they are not  having sex, that one just likes the publicity.’ Fuelling rumours over their friendship, the brunette shared the image of the pair together with her 49,000 Instagram followers last week, writing: 'There's no way to post a picture like this without . feeling a little douchy. 'However in the world of self aware name dropping, this may be the best one yet. So here goes. 'Thank you @mickjagger for amazing few days in Israel. 'Thank you for showing us all how to rock it like a legend. Thank you for being so generous with your energy, time, music. 'To say you're inspirational would be the understatement of the century.' Her . post came just days after Jagger was pictured with a dazzling young . brunette on his hotel balcony in Zurich, Switzerland, whom he is . believed to have picked up in a Zurich nightclub. Moving on: The star has also been pictured posing with model Noa Tishby in Israel after he performed in Tel Aviv on Wednesday . On stage: Sir Mick met the model after his performance at Hayarkon Park in Tel Aviv (pictured) Wearing what appears to be one of his shirts, the singer’s companion was seen leaning in behind him and a friend said today:  ‘He has been up to his old tricks with women since the tour started a couple of weeks ago. There have been several already. Everybody is really pleased about it, delighted actually. It’s good to see him back in the saddle. 'The woman in Zurich, he picked up in a nightclub. It was just a passing fling and is over now and he has moved onto the next one. 'To Jagger, having sex is like taking a beer out of the fridge.' As to the identity of the brunette, in some quarters she has been identified as a Russian ballerina, though there has been no corroboration of that suggestion. In any case, Jagger’s camp are quite sure the woman in question is, in their words, ‘a goner’, and has been discarded by the priapic frontman. The source added: ‘I don’t think he will start another serious relationship for a long time because that would feel like a betrayal of L’Wren, but this sort of a fling does not. ‘He didn’t leak the Zurich girl on purpose, but the Stones camp and Mick are really quite glad that it’s out. Mick doesn’t want to be seen as some sort of broken old bloke who is on the look-out for his  next wife.’ But for the sister of L’Wren Scott, it is too much too soon. Partner: L'Wren Scott was found dead in her Manhattan apartment in March. The couple had been together for 13 years and the rock legend was said to be 'devastated and distraught' at her death . Jan Shane attacked the Stones frontman, saying: ‘And people wonder why L’Wren was so depressed.’ Speaking . from her Utah home, the  53-year-old, who was estranged from her . sister, added: ‘These pictures make me really wonder what Mick is . thinking  and feeling. ‘His . daughter says that he is still heartbroken and so devastated about . losing my sister. And then you see these  photos – he will never . change.’ 'Too much too soon': L'Wren's sister Jan Shane attacked the Stones frontman for the balcony pictures, saying: 'And people wonder why L'Wren was so depressed¿ . Miss Scott, 49, killed herself in March . in her Manhattan apartment. There was no suicide note, but business . records showed her design company, LS Fashion, had racked up millions of . pounds of debt – a burden thought by friends to have caused her a level . of distress that she kept private. Miss . Scott and Jagger were together for 13 years and the fashion designer . was widely regarded as having tamed his roving eye. Following her death, . Jagger was said to be distraught. In a statement, he said he could not . understand  how his ‘lover and best friend could end her life in this . tragic way.’ The Stones were . forced to cancel the Australian leg of their tour  after the tragedy . and resumed their concert dates only last month.","Leo DiCaprio's ex was celebrating her 29th birthday at Rolling Stones Tel Aviv gig last Wednesday .

"By . Emma Reynolds . A mother of six who has had 12 operations to give her L-cup breasts says she will not stop having cosmetic surgery until they are the biggest in the world. Lacey Wildd's children say they are embarrassed by their mother's obsession, but the 44-year-old from Miami, Florida, is already planning her next visit to the surgeon to go up to a Triple-M. Four of her children Tori, 17, Michael, . 15, Brendon, 10, and Jenaveve, five, still live at home, and Tori has . faced teasing at school because of her mother's appearance. Embarrassing mum: Lacey Wildd's children - from left Brandan, 10, Michael, 15, Jenaveve, 5 and Tori, 17 - desperately want her to stop having surgery . Then and now: Lacey Wildd in 1990 after her first operation, left, and today as an L-cup . But despite her children's concerns, . Ms Wildd, real name Paula Simonds, is determined to have the procedure - . which will make her one of the top five biggest breasted models in the . world. 'If I have triple M implants it will take me into the top 5 big breasted models in the world,' said Ms Wildd. 'There is a top 5 and then everybody else is below that. 'It will increase my fame and earning power considerably. I want to make the most of this opportunity, to give my kids a good lifestyle.' Ms Wildd's . children, including 27-year-old Ivy and 24-year-old Silas, who no . longer live at home, say her huge breasts are embarrassing and want her . to stop risking her health. They are worried the MMM . implants will cause terrible side-effects such as stretching, tearing, . or even an infection that might kill her. Tori said: 'I don't want my mom to have her boobs made any bigger. Career boost: Ms Wildd, left after surgery in 2001 and right today, says having bigger breasts will help her support her family . 'I think she isn't really thinking about our opinions. What if she dies? Is she taking that into consideration? 'Does she really care that her kids could be left alone?' Cosmetic surgery carries the same general risks as all operations, including infection and blood clots. There's also a risk of bleeding and scarring. Problems that can occur immediately after breast reconstruction surgery include infection, fluid under the wound and pain and discomfort. If the area around the breast implant becomes repeatedly infected or fluid keeps building up, the implant may need to be removed. Sometimes, the flap of tissue that is used to make a new breast can die and will need to be surgically removed. Long-term problems that can develop after breast reconstruction surgery include the implant hardening and changing shape, fluid leaks from the implant making lymph glands swell and unequal-sized breasts due to changes in weight. But the surgery-addicted model, who recently split from long-term boyfriend Manny, insists she will be careful. She said she is preparing her skin for the larger . implants to avoid the risks of rupturing, and will take every care to . avoid dangerous staph infections. 'I've stopped wearing a bra, so my skin has time to stretch,' she said. 'I'm also trying to lose weight, and I went on a diet of liquid, vitamin B12 shots and apples for a while.' Ms Wildd wears a corset to sculpt her . waist, and has also had two tummy tucks, four full body . liposuctions, abs sculpting, bottom implants and two bottom lifts. 'I know that the surgery is going to be dangerous,' she said. 'I went into this knowing that there are going to be very big risks involved. But I'm ready to take that chance.' If she goes ahead, her new MMM implants . will propel her into the top echelons of big breasted models, which is . headed by 164XXX Chelsea Charms. Cosmetic and reconstructive surgeon . Dr Alberto Gallerani, based in Miami, warned that Ms Wildd may be suffering from body dysmorphic disorder and should not have further breast implants. 'The skin around her breasts is already extremely thin, and it would be too dangerous for her to undergo more surgery,' he said. Addicted: The glamour model has had 12 breast enlargements as well as tummy tucks, bottom implants and silcone implants in her lips . Family love: The 44-year-old with and her daughter Tori, 17, who says she is mocked at school because of her mother . 'I would advise she reconsider and seek help for her surgery obsession.' But Ms Wildd believes there are surgeons willing to carry out larger breast . implants, and is considering going abroad for an op. She admitted she worries about the effects of her fame in her children, especially Tori and Michael, who are in high school. 'I know Tori probably gets teased at school about me. All the boys she knows want to be my friends on Facebook,' she said. 'But whenever the kids bring friends home, they see I'm really cool, like a normal mom. 'I dress normally at home, play with the kids and make nice meals for my family. 'When I'm not acting or modelling, I'm just like anyone else.' Now she appears in films, TV shows, and advertisements, and has thousands of online fans. The mother, who also has silicone . lip implants, is often mobbed by fans at the beach or the mall while . dressed up for modelling assignments. But whenever she is out with her youngest children she says she is very protective so they have space together as a family. Ms Wildd added: 'I was one of six children, and my mom was so poor we couldn't afford a place with electricity or running water. 'I want to provide for my kids and pay for a college education, so they have opportunities I didn't have.' The model was a showgirl in Vegas when she was younger and says she 'loved the limelight'. After marrying in her 20s and having children, she decided to focus on her family and became a stay-at-home mother. But she added: 'Now I need to support us, so I went back to my career as a big breasted model.' 'I'm 44 now, so I want to do this now while I still can. 'I'm more determined than ever to have this surgery, and make my dreams a reality.'","Glamour model Lacey Wildd, 44, is about to go from an L-cup to a MMM .

"By . Jonathan Petre . Children are so badly taught in religious education lessons that they don’t know why Jesus is a key figure in Christianity, the Government’s education watchdog has found. Too many leave school with little idea of what Jesus did and what he stood for – or how Christianity and other religions have shaped the world, say Ofsted inspectors. A damning report published today finds RE is weak in six in ten schools and pupils are given only a superficial knowledge of faith. Ofted inspectors have found RE is weak in six in ten schools and pupils are given only a superficial knowledge of faith (file picture) Inspectors said teachers lacked the confidence  and knowledge to  ‘stretch’ children. The Church of England said the report ‘places the blame for poor standards squarely on Government policy – in particular the removal of support and the squeeze on places for training RE teachers is a scandal’. The Rev Michael Nazir-Ali, former Bishop of Rochester, said: ‘There is a whole generation of children who have only a superficial knowledge of Christianity.’ The 48-page report, which was based on evidence from more than 200 schools, found low standards, weak teaching and poor leadership. It said a key area of concern was that too many pupils were leaving school with ‘a very limited understanding’ of Christianity.

"By . James Chapman . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling says the taxpayer should not longer fund the system . One firm of solicitors was paid almost £15million in taxpayer-funded legal aid in a year, while 20 individual barristers each raked in more than £300,000, startling official figures reveal. In a graphic illustration of the legal aid gravy train, the Ministry of Justice released a breakdown of payments to lawyers. Among them was that to London-based firm Duncan Lewis, which deals with immigration and asylum cases and topped the payout list for 2011/12. Only established in 1998, Duncan Lewis, which has become one of the country’s fastest growing firms of solicitors, billed taxpayers for a total of £14.63million in civil legal aid. Tuckers, based in London, Birmingham and Manchester, earned the most from publicly-funded criminal cases, taking £8.27million. Immigration, human rights and corporate fraud barrister Balbir Singh was the highest-earning legal aid criminal barrister, earning £493,022. His high profile cases include defending Fariman Khan – jailed for supplying heroin and cocaine worth over £1million in 2007. Paul Storey, a London-based QC who works in a range of fields including family law and personal injury, topped the list of legal aid payments in civil cases, earning £428,192. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the figures demonstrated that it was ‘not sustainable’ for taxpayers to keep funding a legal aid system that has become one of the most expensive in the world. Mr Grayling accused lawyers of going into ‘overdrive’ and making ‘over the top’ claims to try to attack Government plans to reduce the legal aid bill. Barristers and solicitors have demonstrated against planned cuts to the service . Ministers are planning to cut . £220million from the annual criminal legal aid budget in England and . Wales and have already slashed £350million from the legal aid bill for . civil cases. They are consulting on plans to make lawyers compete for contracts and introduce a household disposable income cap, to remove the right of the best off to ask the taxpayer to foot the bill for their representation in court. Criminal defendants living in households with a disposable income of £37,500 or more will be stopped from automatically accessing legal aid, while prisoners’ rights to support will also be curbed. But yesterday leading barristers and human rights campaigners demonstrated on the road outside the Ministry of Justice, waving placards that read ‘justice is not for sale’ and ‘defend legal aid’. Human rights campaigner and Mick Jagger’s ex-wife Bianca Jagger, who addressed yesterday’s protest, said: ‘The legal aid lawyers are really paid very little. Legal workers claimed plans to overhaul legal aid would remove the right of defendants to choose a solicitor and hit those who needed lawyers with specialist expertise . ‘We are not talking about people who . earn a lot of money. Do we want to cut services and legal aid so that we . will have a risk of miscarriages of justice? Let’s remember that 45 per . cent of all people that are charged turn out to be innocent.’ A retired senior judge, Sir Anthony . Hooper, claimed plans to overhaul legal aid would remove the right of . defendants to choose a solicitor and hit those who needed lawyers with . specialist expertise. Mr Grayling accused lawyers of using an ‘evocative and creative defence’ to try to protect legal aid – pointing out that a single trial can cost more than £10million in fees. ‘At around £2billion a year, we have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world. At a time of major financial challenges, felt by businesses and households across the country, the legal sector cannot be excluded from our commitment to getting the best value for money for the taxpayer,’ he told the Daily Mail. money.jpg . ‘Our proposals absolutely protect the right to a fair trial. Good lawyers will still be available, just as they are now, as contracts will only be awarded to those who meet clear quality standards.’ The Justice Secretary said the Government currently spent more on legal aid than on preventing criminals reoffending or apprenticeships. ‘ . Sir Anthony, who retired as a Court of Appeal judge last year, insisted the plans risked harming a system of fair justice. ‘If I’m arrested in Norwich on a complex fraud case, for example, I would be able under the present system to find maybe a solicitors in London or Manchester, or wherever it may be, who specialise in difficult fraud cases,’ he said. ‘Not now. Someone will turn up at the door and say “I’m representing you. And by the way, I’m employed by the following company”.’ A spokesman for Duncan Lewis said it provided legal advice and assistance to approximately 25,000 clients a year, adding: ‘Many of our fee earners have enhanced accreditation qualifications and panel memberships with the Law Society and have been acknowledged as experts in their fields within the legal community. ‘At a time where the Government has made and continues to make drastic cuts to the provision of legal aid, Duncan Lewis is one of the few established firms left providing legal advice and assistance under the legal aid scheme, making it possible for members of the public, many of them vulnerable, to have continued access to justice.’ JAMES SLACK . Asil Nadir received £1million in legal aid . The legal profession – which stands to lose more than £200million a year in fees – has been fighting the most ferocious lobbying campaign against cuts to the £1billion criminal legal aid budget. In order to make their case, lawyers and their supporters have focused on highly emotive issues. For instance, Sir Anthony Hooper told the BBC that – because defendants will no longer be able to pick whichever lawyer they want – disabled suspects might be left with somebody who does not understand their condition. The Ministry of Justice dismisses this criticism, saying all lawyers under the new regime will have to meet rigorous standards. But, in any case, it is hugely misleading to suggest Mr Grayling’s reforms are designed to target the poor and the vulnerable. Rather, they will reduce the income of some of the best paid lawyers in the land, stop prisoners making frivolous claims against the State and turn off the legal aid tap to the very wealthy. Currently, the best paid QCs can rake in more than £500,000 in a single year, usually by working on complicated cases which the legal system manages to stretch out for months and even years. In 2010/11, more than £1.5million from public funds went to  just three barristers. In so-called ‘very high cost cases’, which last more than 90 days, payments will now be reduced by 30  per cent. With fees standing at £500-a-day for advocacy, plus up to £150 per hour for preparation work, lawyers will struggle to convince the public they are being hard done by. In other measures, defendants living in households with a ‘disposable income’ of £37,500 or more are to be stopped from automatically accessing legal aid. In reality, this will not affect anybody earning less than £100,000-a-year. But it will mean that the likes of the former fugitive Asil Nadir would no longer be able to take the taxpayer for a ride. Nadir – who rented a £23,000-a-month London residence during his trial – received £1,056,588. Other criminals who have milked the system include convicted gangster Terry Adams, who got £4.7million. Then there are criminals who have . already been convicted. The Association of Prison Lawyers (the existence . of which speaks volumes) said Mr Grayling’s reforms would effectively . remove legal aid for all prison law issues other than parole and . disciplinary hearing. Again, once the detail is known, they may struggle to convince the public this is a bad thing. Currently, taxpayers are handing nearly half a million pounds in legal aid every week to prisoners making human  rights claims. Last . October, one of the country’s most senior judges, Lord Justice Davis, . warned that  human rights laws meant ‘unthinkable’ cases were coming . before the courts. He hit . out as he dismissed a case brought by two prisoners – rapist Desmond . Grant, who was given legal aid, and paedophile Roger Gleaves – who . demanded an end to ‘slopping out’. They were unhappy at having no toilet . in their cell.","Ministry of Justice released a breakdown of payments to lawyers .

Simultaneously, airstrikes were called in to take out the opposition forces.

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . Most children cannot hide their excitement when they hear that they are going to have a new little brother or sister. But not this boy, whose first reaction to his mother's big news is to ask: 'What were you thinking?' The American toddler, called Trey by his mom, then spends the next minute-and-a-half explaining why his mother is wrong to 'replace' him with another baby. Scroll down for video . 'I've got something to tell you': The boy looks apprehensive as his mom prepares to deliver the news - and his reaction is one of utter exasperation . Sitting on a booster seat in the back of the car, Trey says he is 'exasperated' by his mother's decision. When his mom gives him the news, he puts his head in his hands and says: 'What were you thinking? Why you have to go and get another baby? You just had two. 'This is exasperating, because you just got two. 'So why do you wanna get another baby and just replace one of your babies? It's too much.' Trey's mother tries to explain that she would never replace him or his sister, Amaya, who is sat next to him quietly observing the argument. 'It makes no sense': Trey, who already has one younger sibling, just cannot get his head round the fact his mother is going to have another child . She says: 'You're just gonna have another brother or sister that you have to help take care of.' But her son replies adorably, holding his hands up and saying: 'But that doesn't make no sense. 'Because if it made sense then you'd just have two babies and you keep loving them forever and not having another baby between us.' After asking his mother whether the baby will be a boy or a girl, disgruntled Trey tells her that a boy crying will be 'even worse' than his sister's. He explains that he heard a baby boy crying at school, holding his hands to his ears as he recounts the clearly painful memory. A boy will be 'even worse': Trey dismisses his mom's comments when he asks her what sex his new sibling will be. Apparently having a little brother would be even more of a problem than a sister . Tiring of the conversation, his pregnant mother says: 'Well Trey, I don't know what to tell you about the crying, you just gotta get used to it, OK?' He cheekily replies: 'OK, and buy me some earplugs too.' The video, uploaded yesterday, already has more than 38,000 views.","Mother tells her son, Trey, that she is having a baby, but he reacts terribly .

"By . Ryan Kisiel for the Daily Mail . England rugby bosses were criticised today after they unveiled a new £91 replica jersey – 10 months before they launch another. The shirt, which is made by Canterbury, will be used by the national team in the forthcoming Autumn internationals and next year’s Six Nations tournament. But Rugby Football Union (RFU) sources today confirmed that another shirt would go on sale next July in time for the sport’s world cup, which is being held in England. Scroll down for video . The new shirt, which is made by Canterbury, will be used by the national team in the forthcoming Autumn internationals and next year’s Six Nations tournament . Under the tournament’s rules, all teams must remove sponsorship logos and attach a Rugby World Cup 2015 badge while taking part. Every country taking part will therefore have to change their strips by September. It means the England rugby team will only wear the ‘Test’ shirt for around 12 matches before switching again. The manufacturers brought out three other ‘Pro’ and ‘Classic’ official jerseys at £56 each that are also replicas, but not made to the same standards as the ‘Test’ strips the players wear. Critics argue the price and short shelf-life of the new shirts will put struggling parents under pressure with demands from children to keep up with the latest kit. It comes after David Cameron called for a ‘re-think’ when the England football team unveiled a £90 replica football shirt before this year’s World Cup. The price was not changed despite the Prime Minister saying fans would ‘welcome’ the Football Association and Nike reconsidering the hefty costs, which were branded by some as a ‘rip-off’. Spot the difference: The new kit, worn by Geoff Parling (left), sees the rose moved to the centre of the shirt . Former England rugby captain Fran Cotton, who part-owns the clothing company Cotton Traders, said: ‘It’s a lot of money for a short-term shirt. That’s the bottom-line. ‘I don’t think a lot of parents will buy this shirt and then another in 10 months’ time. It’s amazing the pressure parents are put under by their children to buy them. ‘It’s a hell of a lot of money to pay for this new shirt and I don’t think it will be very comfortable to wear while watching the games in the pub.’ The new shirt’s design has not changed much from the previous one launched last September, apart from moving the English Rose badge from the left to the centre. Suppliers Canterbury claim the ‘Test’ jersey costs more because it is made from more flexible polyester and elastane fibres, has increased strength around the arms to prevent ripping and a small ‘loop’ collar. It also has a ‘ball deadening’ rubber grip chest panels that allegedly help players keep hold of the ball. The RFU also released a scarlet alternate kit, which England will wear against Samoa on November 22 . Demand for the tickets for next year’s Rugby World Cup saw queues on the online ticket system when the sales window last week. Over-subscribed games will be decided via a ballot after the sales window shuts on September 29. Prices for adults range from £15 for low-profile group games up to £715 for the best seats at the final at Twickenham. The cheapest adult ticket to watch an England group game at the same stadium will be £75, and £50 for their match against a play-off winner in Manchester. RFU chief commercial & marketing officer Sophie Goldschmidt said: ‘As rugby develops, especially at the elite end, there a requirement for a shirt that is technically advanced from a performance and strength perspective and so we develop new kits for the England team season by season. ‘Many fans want to show their support for the team by wearing the latest kit so we make it available for them. 'Prices for this season’s kit are the same as last. Every penny made or saved at the RFU is put back into rugby. So all revenues from sales of our shirts will be ploughed back into the game as part of our £27m-plus investment in the grassroots every year.’","RFU release new England kit for the Autumn Internationals and Six Nations .

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . It is easy to imagine that prehistoric hunting tools did not pack much of a punch compared to modern weaponry. But scientists say that stone spear points used by our ancestors 500,000 years ago, are comparable to  bullets that expand on impact because they create large ‘wounds’. They think that the use of stone tips had a large impact on human evolution because it allowed early humans to hunt large animals effectively. Scientists at Arizona State University fired wooden and stone-tipped spears (pictured) - similar to those used by our ancestors 500,000 years ago -  into gelatine to examine the nature of the impact . Experts tested stone-tipped and sharpened wooden spears and found that both had the same penetrating power. However, the stone point caused far more damage and was likened to the hollow-nose or ‘dum-dum’ bullet that expand on impact and are more destructive than regular bullets. The study involved shooting six stone-tipped and six sharpened wooden spears into gelatine and examining the degree of penetration and damage they produced. Scientists fired stone-tipped spears into gelatine and found that created a significantly larger and wider ‘wound’ cavity. The cross-bow set up is pictured top, the gelatine bottom left and the target, bottom right . Compared with wooden spears, the stone-tipped weapons made a large 'wound'. Experts think that the use of stone tips had a large impact on human evolution because it allowed early humans to hunt large animals effectively. Dr Jane Wilkins said: ‘Humans with stone-tipped spears were more likely to kill the game that they targeted, and were able to secure high quality food resources more frequently and regularly.’ All were fired from a cross-bow with the same amount of force. Scientists found that the stone-tipped spears created a significantly larger and wider ‘wound’ cavity. Dr Jane Wilkins, of Arizona State University, said: ‘Hafting a stone point to the end of a spear was an important innovation that changed life for Pleistocene humans. ‘Humans with stone-tipped spears were more likely to kill the game that they targeted, and were able to secure high quality food resources more frequently and regularly.’ Up-grading spears with stone tips may have had a major impact on human evolution, according to the study, published in the journal Plos One. The reserachers said that it took our ancestors time and effort to prepare and assemble a spear with a stone tip. While they broke more frequently than sharpened wooden points - which could be dangerous when faced with a large angry animal – early humans seemed convinced that stone-tipped spears were a good idea, the experts said. Benjamin Schoville said: ‘Putting a fragile stone tip on a spear is risky, but we show that there are serious rewards in terms of both the size and shape of the wound created that made this innovation extremely worthwhile during our evolution.’ The researchers said that the manufacture of stone-tipped spears is thought to have been passed from generation to generation. Scientists fired stone-tipped spears into gelatine and found that created a significantly larger and wider ‘wound’ cavity. In the same way, hollow-nosed bullets that expand on impact (pictured) are more destructive than regular bullets.

Sahar Daftary, 23, had a furious row with her husband Rashid Jamil after discovering Miss Penney and her friend had been staying in the flat. An hour after former escort Miss Penney and Helen Marshall, another escort, left the property, Miss Daftary fell 150ft to her death. Confrontation: The glamour girl who is believed to have enraged a catwalk model who plunged to her death from a luxury apartment an hour after they met has been named as Lauren Penney, pictured . Property developer Mr Jamil has always insisted that Miss Daftary, a former Face of Asia winner, committed suicide – an explanation her family refused to accept. Last week, almost four years after her death, a coroner recorded an open verdict into her death . The inquest heard that Miss  Penney had been living in Mr Jamil’s apartment in Salford Quays, Manchester, with Miss Marshall for a fortnight when she first met Miss Daftary. Miss Penney did not attend the inquest but a statement from her was read out. It said she had been introduced to Mr Jamil by a mutual friend while on holiday in Dubai in July 2008.

The 28-year-old from Bolton, who also . worked as a make-up artist, moved into his apartment with Miss . Marshall, who worked for the same escort agency, in December 2008. Mr . Jamil would often ‘pop round’ to see Miss Marshall, but on the night of . Miss Daftary’s death he was anxious for the escorts to leave. Happier times: Sahar Daftary, right, and Rashid Jamil on their wedding day in December 2007 . ‘Rashid was telling us that we  had to leave because he wanted to bring someone back to the flat,’ Miss Penney’s statement said. This angered Miss Marshall because Mr Jamil had said they could stay there. But a short time later he and Miss Daftary came up to the flat. ‘Someone opened the door and there was this beautiful Asian woman standing there,’ Miss Penney’s statement said. ‘She looked very upset and  said, “Who are you and who brought you here?” ‘Helen and I were very surprised and shocked that this woman, who did not know us, was being angry towards us.’ Miss Penney said that throughout the confrontation Mr Jamil stood behind Miss Daftary looking ‘embarrassed’ and ‘sheepish’. After a short while the two women left the flat and did not return until the following day, when they were informed of Miss Daftary’s death. Mr Jamil, 37, was arrested on suspicion of murder but was released without charge. Miss Daftary’s family accuse Greater Manchester Police of failing to carry out a proper investigation. The Bolton inquest was told Miss Daftary had married Mr Jamil, from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, in December 2007 in an Islamic wedding despite discovering that he was already married with two children. Miss Daftary went to live with Mr Jamil at the exclusive NV Buildings at Salford Quays in May 2008. But after two weeks the relationship broke down and she returned to her home in Brentford, West London.","Sahar Daftary, 23, found Lauren Penney in her husband's luxury apartment .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard for MailOnline . A ghostly portrait of Schrödinger's cat has revealed one of physics' most bizarre theories: quantum entanglement. Incredibly, the image was created using light that never interacted with the stencil, while the photons that hit the stencil were not seen by the camera. The experiment could someday lead to the development of quantum imagers that can create detailed pictures of delicate biological samples, such as tissue. A ghostly portrait of Schrödinger's cat has revealed one of physics' most bizarre theories: quantum entanglement.Incredibly, the image was created using light that never interacted with the stencil, while the photons that hit the stencil were not seen by the camera . Schrödinger's cat experiment asks: If you put a cat inside an opaque box and make his life dependent on a random event, when does the cat die? When the random event occurs, or when you open the box? Common sense may suggest the former, but quantum mechanics claims someone has to observe the result before the cat is dead. That means the cat is in both states until you open the box and look at it, and only at that point does the state of the cat become certain. Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment created by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935 (left). The latest experiment has allowed scientists at the Austrian Academy of Sciences have found a way to observe the cat without ever having to 'look' at it using photons of light (right) The latest experiment has allowed scientists at the Austrian Academy of Sciences to find a way to observe the cat without ever having to look at it. Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment created by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935. In the hypothetical experiment a cat is placed in a sealed box next to a radioactive sample, a Geiger counter and a bottle of poison. If the Geiger counter detects that the radioactive material has decayed, it will trigger the smashing of the bottle of poison and the cat will be killed. The experiment was designed to show the flaws in something known as the ‘Copenhagen interpretation’ of quantum mechanics. This states that a particle exists in all states at once until observed. If the Copenhagen interpretation suggests the radioactive material can have simultaneously decayed and not decayed in the sealed environment, then it follows the cat too is both alive and dead until the box is opened. As part of the experiment, scientists created yellow and red pairs of entangled photons. Yellow photons were sent to the cat stencil, while red photons went to the camera. As a result of entanglement, the red photons formed the image of the cat because they created a 'quantum link' with their yellow pairs. This means that one photon has the potential to travel through the subject of a photo and then disappear. However, the other goes to a detector but somehow still 'knows' about its twin's life and can be used to build up an image, according to Nature's Elizabeth Gibney. The work, scientists say, might help physicists solve what they call the measurement problem. This is the question of why quantum states take on certain values only when they are observed. In this experiment, researchers measured the entangled state of a pair of photons using only one photon of the entangled pair. They had previously only been able to see the entangled state when they had to measured both photons. 'What's most intriguing thing about this experiment is how information is contained in twin photons,' researcher Gabriela Lemos told Live Science. 'How, in an entangled state, [this information] can be accessed by one photon.'","In Schrödinger's cat experiment, a cat in a box, whose fate is decided by subatomic particles, is both alive and dead until someone looks at it .

The Abbott government is preparing to cancel the passports of a number of suspected allies of the Islamic State . The Government believes there is a growing number of Australians travelling to join the Insurgency in Iraq and Syria, despite warnings they will face jail sentences if they return to Australia . Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop told The Courier Mail that more than one passport is being cancelled a week. 'I can confirm I have cancelled three passports in the past week, four this month, and seized one foreign passport this week for security reasons.' 'Since July 1, 2013, a total of 55 passports were cancelled. About 45 have been done by me.' These figures are set to rise when the Government introduces tough new terror laws in the next Parliamentary sittings. The planned legislations will make it easier for the Government to cancel passports and suspend foreign passports for those with dual citizenship. Julie Bishop (above) has said that more than one passport is being cancelled a week, and that 55 have been cancelled since July 2013 .

The group of Special Air Service soldiers flew in secret from the RAAF base in northwest Sydney, headed for an operating base in the United Arab Emirates. The soldiers will be based there until they are called upon by the United States to begin strikes against the Islamic insurgents. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has recently sent a clear warning to Australian citizens fighting with the Islamic State that if they are killed by fire from Australian fighter jets: . 'They knew the risks, they took their chances, they broke Australian law, they are doing something which is a very serious offence under Australian law. Mr Abbott added that Australian defectors were one of the motives for this weeks campaign. 'It was one of the principle reasons for committing to the anti-ISIL fight, that there are Australians there in significant numbers who wish to do us harm.'","Four Australian passports have been seized this month .

Planning documents for the tool specifically name the FBI, CIA and DEA as core participants - meaning they would have easy access not only to billions of email and phone records, but also mobile phone locations and internet chat records. ICREACH, initially projected to cost between $2.5 million and $4.5 million per year, can be used by more than 1,000 analysts working at 23 US government agencies that perform intelligence work, according to a 2010 memo. Information shared through the program can be used to track people's movements, map out their networks of friends and potentially reveal religious affiliations or political views. Huge-scale operation: NSA (headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, pictured above) hailed the creation of the secret search engine, ICREACH, as a landmark in the history of classified US government surveillance . According to the NSA documents obtained, the launch of ICREACH was a landmark moment in the history of secret US government surveillance. To allow government agents to make sense of the vast database of records, experts working with the NSA designed a simple Google-like search function. This meant analysts could run searches against particular 'selectors' associated with a person they were investigating such as a phone number or email address. A page of results would then be presented - displaying personal data such as a list of monthly phone calls. Such information enables analysts to form a network of data on a particular person - where they identify details such as friends, family, interests and activities. The tool was masterminded by retired NSA chief Keith Alexander. The spy agency described ICREACH as a 'one-stop shopping tool' for analysing communications. The search tool was built with the intention of becoming the largest system for internally sharing secret surveillance records in the country - capable of processing two to five billion new records every day. This includes more than 30 different kinds of data obtained from emails, phone calls, faxes, internet chats and text messages, as well as location information collected from mobile phones. Earlier revelations arising from leaked Snowden documents have exposed several NSA programs designed to collect large volumes of communications from innocent parties. The spy agency has admitted that it shares some of its data with domestic agencies such as the FBI, but details about just how far it goes have long been a mystery. Using Section 215 of the Patriot Act, the organisation has stored information on millions of ordinary American citizens' phone calls - which in turn has been made available to just a small number of NSA employees, as previously revealed by The Guardian. Such information has only been accessible in relation to counter-terrorism investigations though. ICREACH grants access to a massive set of data - which can be viewed by analysts from across the intelligence community for 'foreign intelligence'. This allows data to be accessed on a far broader scope that just counter-terrorism. A top-secret memo dated December 2007 noted: 'The ICREACH team delivered the first-ever wholesale sharing of communications metadata within the U.S. Intelligence Community. 'This team began over two years ago with a basic concept compelled by the IC's increasing need for communications metadata and the NSA's ability to collect, process and store vast amounts of communications metadata related to worldwide intelligence targets.'","Documents provided by Edward Snowden reveal huge-scale program .

Tyson Fury is seeking a Saturday night replacement for Dereck Chisora so he can still have his second heavyweight fight in 15 months. Chisora fractured his left hand during his final sparring session and withdrew on Monday - just five days before the first bell in Manchester. Chisora’s late withdrawal follows the collapse of Fury’s two fights with David Haye, which have stalled the giant traveller’s career. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tyson Fury throws table at press conference for Chisora fight . Injury setback: Dereck Chisora (left) has had to pull out of his fight with Tyson Fury (right) Previous encounter: Fury won the original bout against Chisora on points back in 2011 .

But Fury is now expected to face a new opponent at the phones4u Arena. ‘After being messed about so much I’m determined to box on the Manchester show despite Chisora pulling out,’ said Fury. 'This has all been very frustrating.  We are looking for an adequate replacement and I will be fighting on Saturday night. ‘I’ve been training for months and I’m in the best shape of my life so for this to happen again is a big blow.’ Fury was due to meet Chisora for the right to face world champion Wladimir Klitschko, three years after winning their first fight on points at Wembley Arena.

On Monday, Chisora said: ‘I can’t tell you how disappointed I am to have to pull out of the fight but it is on the advice of my specialist. 'I’m sorry for the fans but once my hand is healed and I’m given the all-clear to train and punch again, I’ll be working on the new date. ‘I was in fantastic shape and had a great training camp, probably the best so far in my career, and was looking forward to getting revenge on Fury, but that will have wait. ‘I’m sorry to have to pull out on Fury, as I know that he had been training hard and it was going to be a great fight between two top athletes. I hope we can get it on again soon.’ Promoter Frank Warren insisted the fight will be rescheduled and that Saturday’s show will still go ahead, with middleweight Billy Joe Saunders’s European title fight with Emanuele Blandamura topping the bill. Warren added: ‘There’s no way that Dereck could fight with his hand fractured and there’s no way I would let him get into the ring and fight with an injury like that.’ Big blow: Fury was looking forward to facing fellow Brit Chisora in Manchester on Saturday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . This museum is kicking up a stink - by displaying hundreds of toilets through the ages. The vast collection of loos, commodes and bidets has been curated to document the history of sanitation. Everything from King Louis XIV's personal 'throne' to a modern day portable toilet in a tent are displayed at the sprawling Sublabh International Museum of Toilets in New Delhi, India. Causing a stink: The International Museum of Toilets, in New Delhi, India boasts a vast collection of the bizarre loos from across the centuries worldwide . Many of the toilet specimens are replicas, like this two-storey loo, left, and this basic outdoor cubicle, right . Hundreds flock each month to browse the facts, pictures and artifacts that date back to 2,500 BC. 'It is indeed a very unusual museum and it's the only one of its kind in the world,' says Dr Bindeshwar Pathak, founder of the NGO Sulabh International, who has founded the museum. 'A highlight of the museum is the replica of the throne of King Louis the XIV. The king is believed to have used this to defecate while conducting court sessions.' Toilet humour: The walls are covered in toilet room jokes and parodies. Among the collection is this cushioned loo, left, which was used in Europe's clubs, helping members to keep an eye on table stakes . High design:  The Victorians decorated their toilets with floral designs, left, while one pot from French Royalty in the 1700's mocked the English by being designed as a stack of classic literature . But setting up the museum was no easy task - with curators scouring the globe for unusual toilet-related artefacts. 'We gathered models from across the globe. We have models from over 50 countries here. And, our collection is only increasing,' says Pathak. From the 'chamber pot for ladies' of the 1700's to the 'French commode disguised as a stool with books', the museum houses hundreds of toilet models. Multi-purpose: There was little chance Louis XIV would forget he was king as he sat on his throne-like chamber, left, while right, this toilet doubled-up as a table . Inventive: Among some of the more creative specimens are, from left, the modern portable loo, the Japanese electronic push button toilet and an electric loo that burns human waste into ash . Extremes: From a carefully designed decorative wash basin to a portable toilet inside a pop-up tent, the museum has something from every occasion . 'Once the portable toilets came inside the home, they looked very odd. The French designed a toilet which looked like a bookcase. On this toilet was written the names of literary classics,' reads the description on a French commode. 'We also have the electric toilet. It burns human waste and converts it into ash,' said a museum guide. These outdoor toilets were designed to provide sanitation for 10 people for three years . Through the ages: One toilet has advertising for a bakery in Las Vegas on the lid, left, while pictures of 18th and 19th century toilets form Europe show a variety of styles and designs . The museum also has an extensive display of privies, chamber pots, toilet furniture, bidets and water closets. 'We founded the museum to give a message,' said Gaurav Chandra, the museum's coordinator. 'It's an education for students, who can learn about historical trends in development of toilets. 'India faces a big challenge in sanitation sector. So our museum helps policy makers to understand the efforts that were made in this field in the past.' Founded by Dr Pathak in 1970, Sulabh is now the largest non-governmental organisation in India with over 50,000 volunteers. It works to promote environmental sanitation and waste management. Mr Chandra added: 'Sanitation is a huge issue in India. This museum is a kind of reminder. We want people to come and see.' The museum made it to the list of the Top 10 'Weird and Unusual' museums in the world earlier this year.","King Louis XIV's toilet was designed to look like another throne .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Swarms of vicious Asian hornets are heading across the Channel to Britain, the public has been warned. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it feared the species had already, or was about to, spread to Britain during its peak season of September. Defra said the Asian hornet – Latin name Vespa velutina nigrithorax – was ‘invasive and predatory’ and attacked honey bee colonies. A statement said: 'It has spread very quickly to many areas . of France where it is reported to be causing many problems for both . beekeepers and biodiversity in the country. The hornet can predate on . bee colonies, causing significant harm.' Scroll down for video . Swarm: The Asian hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax, could already have crossed the channel to British shores . It is slightly smaller and darker than an ordinary hornet but packs a vicious sting and the department urged beekeepers to report sightings or send suspected samples to the National Bee Unit laboratory. Asian hornets were first recorded in Lot-et-Garonne, south-west France, in 2005, after arriving in a pottery shipment from China. They spread across France but until now were blocked from coming to the UK by the English Channel. Defra is asking British beekeepers to be on the lookout for the Asian hornet, which is smaller than our own native European hornet, Vespa crabro. Predatory: The Asian hornet is known to attack bee colonies . 'To protect bees from invasive threats it is important for all beekeepers in England, Scotland and Wales to sign up to BeeBase,' a statement from Defra said. It has asked anyone who thinks they have seen an Asian hornet to notify the GB Non Native Species Secratariat alert at the email address alert_nonnative@ceh.ac.uk immediately. Suspect sample can be sent to the National Bee Unit laboratory for examination if possible. Defra advises using a suitable sturdy container (cardboard rather than plastic) and providing as much detail as possible about the hornet and where it was found, along with digital photographs to help with identification. 'Monitoring for their arrival in Britain is strongly encouraged throughout the UK, but especially in areas where likelihood of arrival is considered to be highest, the south and south-east of England,' Defra said. 'Beekeepers and other members of the public should consider hanging hornet traps but remember that it is very important that damage to native wasps, hornets and any other insects is kept to an absolute minimum. 'Spring trapping works. Information from beekeepers in France, who are having to control hornet numbers, show that in areas where traps are deployed in springtime, nest numbers are reduced by up to 90 per cent. 'In the event that Asian hornets become established here, springtime trapping will thus be a very useful management tool.'","Vespa velutina nigrithorax attacks honey bees and spreads quickly .

"By . Sam Cunningham for the Daily Mail . Follow @@samcunningham . Hundreds of millions are once again being spent in the transfer market this summer, but there is still no greater feeling of satisfaction for a club than to bring through a youngster and see them flourish in the first team. It is a huge challenge for young stars with bags of potential to earn the chance to make the step up and go on to become a regular in the senior side. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the best young players in the country to watch out for who could be set to make that breakthrough this season. Club: Chelsea Age: 19 Position: Central Midfielder . John Terry was raving about Baker after he set up all three goals in their 3-2 pre-season friendly win against Wycombe. The 19-year-old scored 17 goals for the Under 21 side last season. He is known for his deadly set piece delivery and can produce moments of magic from nowhere. Moments of magic: Lewis Baker celebrates scoring for Chelsea in the Under 21 final at Manchester United . Club: Manchester City Age: 19 Position: Striker/Winger . The City forward has dad Andy to call on if he ever needs tips on scoring goals. Cole has worked his way through City's academy and Manuel Pellegrini called him up to the squad for their pre-season tour of South Africa last summer. The Chilean is known to be a fan. Family affair: Devante Cole, son of Manchester United legend Andy, will hope to emulate his father's success . Club: Manchester City Age: 19 Position: Centre back . His ability on the ball and reading of the game have drawn comparison to Vincent Kompany – and surely also the fact he is a Belgian centre half. Recently called up to the Belgian under 21 side. Captain material? Jason Denayer has been compared to City first-team skipper Vincent Kompany . Club: Arsenal Age: 21 Position: Attacking Midfielder . It will be tough for the German to break through with the wealth of players in a similar position available to Arsene Wenger, but he is highly rated by the club. Eisfeld has played for the first team in the League Cup already. In action: Thomas Eisfeld has already tasted life in Arsenal's first-team having played in the League Cup . Club: MK Dons Age: 18 Position: Defender/Midfielder . He is on the verge of a move to Everton after handing in a transfer request at MK Dons. The Zimbabwe-born player has been capped by England up to Under 19 level. Those who have watched him play regularly say he is in the mould of Rio Ferdinand. Was the youngest player ever to take to the field for MK Dons, aged just 15, when he came on as a substitute in 2011. High praise: Brendan Galloway (right) has been compared to former England defender Rio Ferdinand . Club: Aston Villa Age: 18 Position: Winger/Attacking midfielder . The Republic of Ireland Under 21 midfielder has spent time on loan at Notts County and played a part in the Villa side who won the Next Gen Series last season. He made the bench of the senior Villa team aged just 16. Winning feeling: Jack Grealish played a part in the Aston Villa side that won the Next Gen Series last season . Club: Liverpool Age: 18 Position: Winger . Ibe has played a couple of first team games for Liverpool already but this looks like his season to really break through. The 5ft 7in flyer has looked the part in pre-season so far, setting up both goals in their 2-1 win against Preston. He's a fast, direct winger and it is understood Brendan Rodgers is a huge admirer. Star in the making: Winger Jordon Ibe (right) has impressed in Liverpool's two pre-season friendlies to date . Club: Everton Age: 16 Position: Central midfielder . He was captain of the England Under 17 team who won the European Championship in May and even scored a penalty in the decisive final shootout against Holland. Considers himself to be similar to Frank Lampard in his playing style. Still very young, but that didn't stop Wayne Rooney or Ross Barkley getting a chance at Goodison Park. Box-to-box starlet: Ryan Ledson captained England Under 17s to  European Championship glory in May . Club: Southampton Age: 19 Position: Winger . Joined Southampton's famed academy aged eight and has been with the club since. The predominantly left-sided player has featured once for the first team, in the FA Cup. Recently signed a new four-year deal. Tied down: Sam McQueen (right) has recently penned a new four-year deal at Southampton . Club: Tottenham Age: 17 Position: Attacking midfielder . Another who was part of the England Under 17 side to lift the European Championship trophy. New Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino is known for bringing youth players into the first team, increasing his chances this season. Some at the club believe this could be his year. Opportune moment: Josh Onomah will be hoping new Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino gives youth a chance . Club: Liverpool Age: 19 Position: Winger/Striker . The Sweden under 21 star has scored in each of Liverpool's opening friendlies against Brondby and Preston. Those goals earned him a place in the squad for their pre-season tour of America, having previously not made the cut. Things are looking up: Kristoffer Peterson has scored in both of Liverpool's pre-season fixtures so far . Club: Southampton Age: 19 Position: Midfielder . Reed has already been around Southampton's first team, making seven appearances for the seniors. With the departures of key players this summer he could become a more regular figure in the side this campaign. Chance: Harrison Reed (left) could feature often for Southampton next season following the sale of key players . Club: Manchester City Age: 19 Position: Centre-back . Rekik, born in Holland but of Tunisian descent, has already been capped by the senior Dutchteam. He has only made one brief appearance for City's first team but his loan spell at PSV Eindhoven last season, where he made 25 league appearances, earned him a place in Louis van Gaal's provisional squad for the World Cup. He did not make the final cut. International pedigree: Karim Rekik (right) was included in Holland's provisional World Cup squad . Club: Fulham Age: 17 Position: Second Striker/Winger . Roberts can play on the right wing, but he is devastating through the middle. At 5ft 5in he is smaller than most of his peers but his low centre of gravity has seen him compared to Lionel Messi. Scored twice on the way to winning the Euros with the England Under 17s and has netted seven goals in 14 internationals for them. After Fulham's relegation it is expected he will get plenty more playing time for their senior team next season. Little gem: At 5ft 5in Patrick Roberts (right) has been compared to Lionel Messi due to his low centre of gravity . Club: Liverpool Age: 17 Position: Midfielder . Robbie Fowler has likened him to Steven Gerrard already, even though he is just 17. Rossiter has got a bit of filling out to do but passes the ball well and is fearless. Yet to play for Liverpool in a competitive fixture but this could be his season. Eyes on the prize: Jordan Rossiter has been compared to Liverpool hero Steven Gerrard by Robbie Fowler . Club: Southampton Age: 18 Position: Left-back . Targett is being lined up as the long-term replacement for Luke Shaw following his move to Manchester United. Another who has been at Southampton's academy since he was eight. Some expect him to follow in the footsteps of the two most famous left-sided players to come through at the south coast club. Bright future: Promising full-back Matt Targett (left) will hope to emulate Luke Shaw's rise at Southampton . Club: Arsenal Age: 19 Position: Central Midfielder/Attacking Midfield . The Spaniard joined Arsenal from Barcelona in 2011 and quickly caught the eye by scoring five times in seven appearances for their Under 18 side. He was included in training with the senior squad last season. Silky Spaniard: Playmaker Jon Toral (left) scored five times in seven appearances for Arsenal's under 18s . Club: Manchester United Age: 18 Position: Striker . Announced himself on the scene with two goals in his first start for United in a 3-1 win against Hull, but that is his only appearance for the senior side. It was a surprise call-up by Ryan Giggs while he was in charge at the club – and he predicted Wilson would go on to become a new Old Trafford star. Dream start: James Wilson (left) scored twice in his Manchester United debut against Hull last season . Club: Tottenham Age: 18 Position: Central midfielder . Made the bench for Tottenham's Europa League quarter-final against Benfica last season, so has had a taste of first-team action. Again, with Pochettino at the helm, expect more Spurs youngsters to be popping up in the senior squad. In pursuit: Tottenham's Harry Winks (left) got a taste of first-team action last year on the bench against Benfica . Club: Arsenal Age: 17 Position: Central Midfield . A former coach said that 'he dribbles like Iniesta and he passes like Xavi.' Jack Wilshere has also hailed the player's ability. Zelalem made his first-team debut in the FA Cup as a 16-year-old, making him the first player born after Arsene Wenger joined Arsenal to play for the first-team. History: Gedion Zelalem (right) is the first player born after Arsene Wenger joined Arsenal to play for them .","Liverpool's Ibe and Manchester United's Wilson have already featured in the Premier League .

"By . Pa Reporter . World number one Novak Djokovic had no explanation for his flat performance in a stunning semi-final loss to Japan's Kei Nishikori at the US Open on Saturday. The 27-year-old Serbian star lost 6-4, 1-6 7-6(4), 6-3 in brutal heat and humidity at the Arthur Ashe Stadium. He said: 'I think he just played better in these conditions than I did. I just wasn't managing to go through the ball in the court. Upset: Kei Nishikori beat Novak Djokovic in straight sets to reach the US Open final . 'I wasn't in balance. Unforced errors. Even when the ball gets back to his part of the court it's pretty short; he takes advantage of it. On the other side I didn't. That's it. 'Other than that second set, my game today was not even close to what I wanted it to be. A lot of unforced errors, a lot of short balls. Just wasn't myself.' Straining to make sense of his showing, reporters asked seven-times grand slam champion Djokovic whether he has been distracted by the approaching birth of his first child. 'Of course, I'm in touch with my wife. Of course, I am being part of her pregnancy. It's normal,' he said. 'But it's no different for me in terms of preparing for the match and for the tournament. 'I had all my dedication, everything directed to this US Open. I tried to give my best and I did. Now my best today was not where I wanted it to be.' No excuses: Djokovic refused to blame the distraction of his wife's pregnancy for his defeat . The Wimbledon champion gave full credit to the 10th-seeded Nishikori, who became the first male Asian player to reach a grand slam singles final. 'He played some great tennis. I congratulate him for the effort,' the Serb said. 'He was the better player today.' Djokovic said it was a great day for Japanese tennis. 'This is definitely huge for Japan,' he said. 'This can definitely be a great encouragement for tennis in that country. First: Nishikori is the first Asian male to make it to the final of a Grand Slam singles tournament . 'He's been around for last couple of years. He's been making a lot of success. But playing finals of a grand slam and now fighting for the title is definitely something different. He has gotten to another level.' As for his future plans, Djokovic sounded unsure. Asked about whether he would play in Serbia's Davis Cup matches next week against India, he said: 'I have to speak with my captain and see, see if I'm going to go in India or not. I still don't know.' He also said was it was too early to tell whether his US Open exit could be the last time he plays this year. 'I don't know yet,' Djokovic said. 'Just got off the court. I don't know.' Unsure: Djokovic said he did not yet know if it would be his final game of the season .","Novak Djokovic out of US Open .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Thousands of families' holidays are under threat from a strike yesterday by Passport Office staff, the government warned. Unions staged walkouts at offices across the country in a dispute over staff shortages which they claim have led to a serious backlog in processing applications this year. But as social media was flooded with complaints about the walkout, the Home Office warned the industrial action at the height of summer will 'inconvenience' people and 'jeopardise' their holidays. Scroll down for video . Members of the PCS union form a picket line outside a Passport Office in Victoria in central London . The Home Office warned the timing of the strike risked jeopardising people's holidays . The Public and Commercial Services (PSC) union said the strike is an attempt to draw attention to staff shortages dating as far back as 2010 as well as inequalities in pay. Thousands of people have been forced to pay extra to upgrade passport applications or face cancelling their holiday. Extra staff have been drafted in to deal with a backlog of 30,000 applications, and Home Secretary Theresa May last month issued an apology to those affected by the delays. David Cameron has blamed a surge in applications this year, as more people plan foreign holidays as the economy picks up. The Passport Office said that it had faced the highest demand for applications in the last 12 years, adding that predictions for the summer surge were 'substantially exceeded'. Customers could be seen waiting to be served at the office in Victoria, as workers protested outside . HM Passport Office chief executive Paul Pugh said earlier this month that the 775,000 applications received in June 'I think is the highest ever recorded in a single month'. The PCS union said the high-profile nature of the recent applications backlog has forced the office to take the issue more seriously. It pointed to recent figures from immigration minister James Brokenshire which showed staff numbers were down by more than 300 in the past four years. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: 'The staffing crisis in the Passport Office has been obvious for everyone to see and it shouldn't have taken a committee of MPs to force the chief executive to meet us to discuss it. 'We are still a long way off getting a commitment from the agency that it will work with us to put the proper resources in place to ensure these backlogs do not reoccur year after year.' Mr Serwotka was ridiculed after claiming the strike was designed to ‘help the public’ by alerting management to staff shortages. Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘This holiday-wrecking strike is a disgrace. Ed Miliband must condemn these union bullies, who are intent on causing misery for millions of families. This strike must be immediately called off.’ Other ministers insisted the strike was ‘irresponsible’. But members of the public vented their anger at holidays being threatened by the backlog and the industrial action. Some who travelled to London from as far as Milton Keynes this morning were being turned away and told to return tomorrow. Tony Spindler, 40, tried to get a passport for his five-year-old son his passport so they could visit family in Greece. He said: 'It's like an airport departure gate up there when the plane has been delayed for 10 hours. 'Everyone's pulling their teeth out. I heard them say they won't be able to return people's one-day passports. 'We've been told we might get ours back later this afternoon but it doesn't look hopeful.' Stephanie Dirubo, 27, was hoping to go to Lanzarote tomorrow with her boyfriend but was facing disappointment. 'Our appointment is already four hours late and I spoke to a woman outside who had been told she would not get her one-day passport back. 'If we don't get ours today, we have no insurance and won't be able to get any money back from our holiday. 'I asked the office last week if it was leaving it too late to pick up a passport the day before leaving but they said it was fine. Now I'm in a complete panic.' Shona Smallman, 61, had her passport stolen and organised an appointment to get a fast-track service before her flight to Spain next week. 'They didn't even tell us about the strike which is really naughty because then you get all the way here and find out you have hours to wait and might even have to come back a different day. 'It's especially unfair at this time of year. I'm really looking forward to going on holiday with my daughter and grandchildren.' Joey Pettit, 28, lives in Milton Keynes and has been told she must come back to the office in Victoria tomorrow, despite having paid £128 for a one-day service. 'I am going to New Zealand in a week and half and stupidly told them so I will probably get pushed to the back of the queue. 'It looks like they'll try and deal with the people leaving tomorrow first.' Social media was flooded with complaints from people fearing their holiday plans will be ruined . Tens of thousands of applications wait to be processed at the Liverpool passport office, one of seven around the country. The picture was taken by a disillusioned staff member . But with millions of people planning to jet off for their summer holidays in the next few weeks, the government condemned the timing of the strike. 'We are disappointed the PCS leadership has called this strike given that HMPO has been in discussions with the union on their issues of concern,' a Home Office spokesman said. 'Holding a strike at this stage is irresponsible and will only inconvenience our customers and jeopardise their holidays. 'We strongly urge PCS to reconsider this action which is not in the interests of staff or the general public they are dedicated to serving. 'HM Passport Office staff know how important it is to hard-working people and their families to receive their passports in time for their summer holidays. 'They have shown this through their hard work and commitment during this exceptional period of high demand.' A PCS spokesman said around 1,600 out of 3,400 staff did not turn up for work, but the Home Office put the figure at 875. HM Passport Office chief executive Paul Pugh said earlier this month that the 775,000 applications received in June was the highest ever in a single month. Mr Serwotka was asked on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme if the strike was designed to ‘help the public’ by alerting management to staff shortages. He said ‘absolutely’. He went on: ‘The staffing crisis in the Passport Office has been obvious for everyone to see. ‘We are still a long way off getting a commitment from the agency that it will work with us to put the proper resources in place to ensure these backlogs do not reoccur year after year.’ The Home Office criticised the union for the strike’s timing. A spokesman said: ‘We are disappointed the PCS has called this strike given that HMPO has been in discussions with the union on their issues of concern. ‘Holding a strike at this stage is irresponsible and will only inconvenience our customers and jeopardise their holidays.’ Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee said: ‘This action will not help the situation and will inflict more suffering on the public.’","PCS union staged walkout in protest at staff shortages and pay dispute .

"By . Paul Newman for the Daily Mail . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . Cricket’s crackdown on throwing claimed its highest-profile victim in Saeed Ajmal on Tuesday, before it was revealed that on-field testing could soon be brought in to finally rid the world game of the chuckers. The International Cricket Council, long derided as a toothless governing body, caused a stir when they banned the best spinner in the world. It is part of a concerted campaign against chucking which has also seen Sri Lanka’s Sachithra Senanayake and New Zealand’s Kane Williamson stopped from bowling. Pakistan and Worcestershire spinner Ajmal was reported for a second time after the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle. In a move which has ramifications for the international and domestic game, he faces a public fight for his future. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pakistan spinner Saeed Ajmal banned by the ICC . Controversial:  Saeed Ajmal bowls during a practice session ahead of their ODI match against Sri Lanka . Ban: Ajmal has been banned indefinitely by the ICC for an illegal bowling action done in Brisbane . Muttiah Muralitharan . Despite holding the all-time record of 800 Test wickets, the Sri Lankan’s action has always been controversial. Though never suspended, Muralitharan was called for chucking on numerous occasions throughout his career. He even went on TV to bowl with a special cast on to try to prove his innocence. Shoaib Akhtar . The Pakistani paceman was suspended by the ICC in December 1999 but had his ban lifted almost immediately. Akhtar was regularly bowling around 95mph but there were concerns about the straightening of his arm before sending down a bouncer or a quicker ball. Brett Lee . The Australian fast bowler emerged at a similar time to Akhtar and his speed raised similar suspicions of an illegal action. But the ICC cleared him in the summer of 2000. Marlon Samuels . As well as being banned in 2008 over a match-fixing scandal, the part-time West Indies offspinner was prohibited from bowling quick deliveries in international cricket due to his action. Ajmal, who earlier this season bowled Worcestershire to a formidable position in the race for second division promotion, is adamant he can prove his innocence in time for February’s World Cup. ‘It is very disappointing but I’m a fighter and I know what I have to do to get back before the World Cup,’ said Ajmal, 36. All of his deliveries, not just the doosra, were found to be illegal after biomechanical tests in Brisbane. ‘The ban is not a problem for me. The ICC have stopped me from bowling because my elbow is bending beyond the 15 degrees allowed and I know I can correct that. My elbow is not usual. That’s why I seem to bend it more.’ Yet Ajmal, who blamed a car accident which damaged his elbow the first time he was reported for throwing five years ago, will have to fight back the hard way once ICC plans for sensors that can be worn during matches to identify throwing are introduced. These are at the final stage of testing in Brisbane. Players will wear two sensors on the back of the arm near the elbow in an attempt to provide more accurate results than those garnered by laboratories away from match conditions. Ajmal is a popular figure who has proved both a mentor and an inspiration to England’s Moeen Ali. There was widespread sympathy for a man who has proved a magician in the Muttiah Muralitharan mould, provides no danger to batsmen and has been the highest wicket-taker in world cricket across all formats in the last three years. Yet there are plenty who will welcome this move as he has long been suspected of throwing — not least privately by England when he bowled them to a 3-0 Test whitewash two years ago. Only this season Michael Vaughan posted a picture on Twitter of Ajmal bowling for Worcestershire with the former England captain and Stuart Broad then apparently questioning the validity of the Pakistani’s action. There will also be those who question the validity of Worcestershire’ s probable promotion after Ajmal’s leading role in taking 63 wickets as their overseas player before leaving for international duty. Ajmal added a yorker fired in at 70mph to his repertoire this season and that has caused consternation because of its ability to bamboozle top order players who were simply unable to pick it. Accused: Australian Brett Lee (left) and Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan both had questionable techniques . Highly regarded: Ajmal is the world's top-ranked one-day international bowler . Essex are one of the counties likely to miss out on promotion because of Worcestershire’s success but there were no complaints from their coach Paul Grayson. He said on Tuesday: ‘Worcestershire have played some very good cricket this season and they are far from a one-man band. ‘The last thing I want to be accused of is sour grapes by complaining now but what I would question is why none of the county umpires reported Saeed. This only came to light when he went off to play for Pakistan.’ Ajmal will almost certainly miss Pakistan’s Test series against Australia next month while he undergoes remedial action but will take heart from the fact that he was cleared the last time this happened. In 2009, testing in Perth found that Ajmal’s elbow has a 23.5 degree bend. Yet, with the ICC deciding that throwing is a major problem among spinners, and not just ‘mystery’ ones, a man who turns 37 next month faces a race against time if he is to be seen at the highest level again.","Saeed Ajmal has been banned by the ICC for an indefinite period .

Families hit by the passport crisis are being asked to pay £55 extra a person to save their summer holidays. With passport staff struggling to clear a backlog of half a million applications, holidaymakers and business travellers face losing costly trips abroad. Officials are now offering to fast-track their documents for £55.50 on top of the £72.50 standard fee. Scroll down for video . Tens of thousands of applications wait to be processed at the Liverpool passport office, one of seven around the country. The picture was taken by a disillusioned staff member . Waiting game: Stacks of passport applications wait to be processed in Liverpool,  and with passport staff struggling to clear a backlog, holidaymakers and business travellers face losing costly trips abroad . Angry . families said they were being held to ransom. And in stormy exchanges in . the Commons, Theresa May was accused of complacency. MPs told the Home . Secretary their constituents were panicking at the prospect of not being . able to travel. Audrey . Strong, 67, from Timsbury, near Bath, said her 94-year-old mother paid . the levy to be able to go on a cruise. She added: ‘They’re holding . people to ransom. It’s disgusting – I don’t think she should have to pay all that money, but she did it because she would have lost her holiday otherwise.’ Parents already pay a premium during school breaks because travel firms, airlines and hotels raise prices. And if a family of four wanted to ensure they had passports in time they would have to pay an extra £222 –the cost of the four-hour collection service. Mrs May played down the problems, insisting the vast majority of applicants were receiving their passports in time. But David Hanson, Labour immigration spokesman, said: ‘It is clear Theresa May is now burying her head in the sand and ignoring the overwhelming evidence of families across the country suffering delays, stress and heartache over their summer holidays and trips abroad. **** . The Home Secretary has dismissed fears of a passport crisis - but insisted she was not 'complacent' Britain's border controls have veered from one crisis to the next. Following revelations that not all visitors were being checked a clamp down was ordered - resulting in giant queues at border controls. Now the Passport Office is under pressure to issue documents in time to let families travel . ‘Each day that passes is throwing up more passport headaches. ‘People . across the country need to know when the Government first knew about . this crisis, how many people are impacted and what they’re doing to . solve it.’ The Passport Office said it had processed 300,000 more applications in the first five months of this year than in 2013. The backlog crisis is only the latest in a string of problems to hit the Passport Office over recent years. In 2008, workers responsible for interviewing applicants, processing and issuing passports went on strike for three days. The action by 2,900 members of the Public and Commercial Services Union, angry over below inflation pay rises, was timed to coincide with the summer getaway. The union estimated the strike resulted in a backlog of as many as 150,000 passport applications.In 2001, holidaymakers faced delays in renewing their passports when 15 staff were suspended in a major fraud probe. And in 1999, at least 500 holidaymakers missed their travel departure dates following problems at the then Passport Agency when a new computer system left it unable to issue passports on time. It cost the taxpayer £12million, including compensation exceeding £161,000 and a further £6million spent on staff overtime. Someone who has lost money after being forced to cancel a holiday because of passport delays is highly unlikely to be able to seek compensation. The Passport Office’s general advice is: ‘Don’t book travel arrangements until you have received your passport.’ Echoing this statement, the Home Office says that processing times are ‘guidance, not a guarantee’. Immigration minister James Brokenshire said 3.3million travel documents had been issued – the highest number for 12 years. Paul Pugh, the passport agency’s chief executive, will go before the . Commons home affairs committee next week. He has said the improving . economy has increased demand for passports. Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said: ‘I have been . inundated with letters from people saying they have been waiting and . waiting for their passport. This could not be happening at a worse time. ‘It’s a no-brainer during the summer months, people tend to want to go . on holiday and therefore they find out their passports need to be . renewed. I think the public expect much better.’ The Home Office website advises it takes three weeks to renew a passport . or obtain one for a child. For a new adult passport, it usually takes . six weeks. But some travellers have complained it is taking up to 16 . weeks.Challenged over the crisis during the Queen’s Speech debate at . Parliament, Mrs May insisted the Passport Office was meeting its targets . despite unprecedented demand. She rejected claims the service was at risk of breaking down and said resources had been increased. Despite the rush in new applications and renewals, 97 per cent of . standard applications had been dealt with within the three-week target, . she claimed. The Home Office said the Passport Office has redeployed more than 200 . staff – some from anti-fraud duties – to frontline operations. It has . also boosted the number of call centre staff from 350 to 1,000. Passport offices are now working from 7am to midnight every day in a bid to clear the backlog. Mrs May added: ‘We are not complacent about this issue, we are . continuing to look to see if there are further contingency measures that . need to be put into place.’ The PCS union has threatened strike action unless the management . addresses the backlogs as well as pay and conditions at the agency. The Passport Office recorded a surplus of £72.9million in 2012-13. Holly Hadri is grounded in Dubai without a passport and fears she will miss her brother’s wedding. The mother of two is originally from Cardiff but lives in the United Arab Emirates with her husband Salim, 33, an IT project manager. The 31-year-old is due to give birth this week and needs to apply for a passport for the baby. But she is still waiting for her own passport to be renewed after sending it off six weeks ago – and without that, her infant application will not be processed. Holly Hadri, pictured with her sons Isaac and Aden, is due to give birth this week and needs a passport for her baby - but she is still waiting for her own passport to be renewed and could miss her brother's wedding . Mrs Hadri fears she will not be able to obtain the passports in time for her brother’s wedding in Belfast on August 23. She contacted the Passport Office on Friday, but staff were unable to trace her application. She said: ‘Friends of mine are waiting between 8 and 16 weeks. All in all it looks like my family will miss my brother’s wedding. To say that I am upset is an understatement.’ Rory Pattinson looks set to miss out on a romantic break away thanks to the chaos. The 23-year-old applied to renew his passport via the Post Office check-and-send service on April 29 – seven weeks before he was due to set off. Now, just days before he is to fly to Turkey on June 20, he still has no idea when it will come. He said: ‘They told me it would take three weeks, so I thought I had applied in plenty of time.’ Mr Pattinson, a security guard from Worcester, agreed to pay £55 to fast-track the process on Friday. He was told a courier would deliver the passport on Monday, but it did not appear. He said: ‘My girlfriend and I will lose £700 if we are forced to give up our holiday. It’s a complete nightmare.’ Eileen Shepherd (left) missed her £1,700 holiday after bureaucratic delays over sending the Passport Office her signature, while Rory Pattinson (right) looks set to miss out on a romantic break away thanks to the chaos . Eileen Shepherd had to miss her £1,700 holiday after bureaucratic delays over sending the Passport Office her signature. The 67-year-old retired nurse from Darlington, County Durham, only realised her passport was about to run out after booking the trip for May 24. She filled out an online application on April 17, but was unable to print the vital form to record her signature. She twice called the Passport Office, who agreed to post one – but after it did not arrive she visited the Passport Office in Durham in person. She was stunned to be told she was not allowed to apply in person because her details were already in the system. After pleading with officials, they agreed to scrap the application so she could do it face-to-face. But instead of an appointment she received a form. She sent it by special delivery, but although it was signed for the next day, officials claimed not to have received it until four days later. On May 20, Mrs Shepherd agreed to pay extra to fast track the application – but it still did not arrive in time. She is now considering legal action, adding: ‘I tried every which way. They had seven weeks. The friend I was going with had to go all by herself.’","Exclusive picture reveals extraordinary backlog of applications in one office .

A large number of Indian fans verbally abused Moeen during the Twenty20 international against England at Edgbaston, perhaps due to his Pakistani heritage or Muslim faith. Birmingham-born Moeen played down the incident, but his father Munir said: ‘We are very disappointed with what happened. Targeted: England all-rounder Moeen Ali was the subject of abuse from sections of the Indian support . On top: Wicket celebration by  Moeen Ali  after he bowls India's Ajinkya Rahane - . ‘It should have been a special day. Moeen was playing for his country in the city of his birth. It is the city I was born in and the city my mother was born in. The family was looking forward to it and we thought he would get a warm welcome. ‘Instead he was abused from the start. He was abused because he is a Muslim and because of his Pakistan heritage. That is disgraceful. ‘We have experienced so much kindness and goodwill from all communities in recent months, so it is disappointing that some fans let their team down with this behaviour. ‘There is still a problem with racism between Asian communities in the UK.’ Angus Porter, chief executive of the Professional Cricketers Association, admitted his attempt to play down the incident had only inflamed it. Upset: Birmingham-born Moeen was booed during T20 clash . Porter was forced to apologise after his comments early on Tuesday risked repeating the mistake made by football’s League Managers Association in the Malky Mackay affair by taking a serious situation too lightly. Porter had said: ‘His dad offered his view sincerely and I hope it doesn’t stoke the fire because he was just standing up for his boy. There is an element of taking it as a compliment. You are more likely to boo someone when you think they are someone to be feared. ‘Take it as a positive, you’d rather be booed than ignored. ‘It shouldn’t happen but I have always found Indian supporters respectful so it is a little bit surprising.’ But later Porter added in a statement: ‘I would like to clarify comments I made, which have been interpreted as meaning I do not regard racism as a serious matter. Claim: Moeen's father, Munir, believes the booing had racial undetones . ‘I want to make it clear I believe racist attitudes and behaviour are unacceptable, at any level, in professional cricket, or in any walk of life.’ Ravi Bopara and Samit Patel have also endured booing by Indian fans while playing for England, but nothing like the level of that suffered by Moeen. Porter’s comments and later statement came as the ECB were revealing their long-term plan for engagement with South Asian communities at a function at Westminster. Clearly those plans do not include the racial abuse of an England cricketer on an English ground, and cricket has a problem if third or fourth generation British Asians feel obliged to attack a cricketer because of where his great-grandfather was born.

"By . Sam Peters For Daily Mail . Richard Cockerill doesn’t know if he’s upset too many people at the RFU to ever be considered for the England head coach’s job. He doesn’t particularly care. The Leicester Tigers director of rugby has lost count of the number of times he’s been ticked off by the authorities for bad behaviour — including two hefty bans for verbally abusing match officials — and the only people he worries about upsetting with his foul-mouthed tirades are his wife, Sarah, and their young family. ‘My wife just looks at me and says, “What have you done now?”’ said Cockerill. Leicester Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill wonders if he has ticked off the RFU too much to become England head coach . Richard Cockerill has won three Premiership titles in his time at Leicester . ‘My kids remind me when I’m reprimanding them. They say, “You say naughty words and on television as well dad”. I have to hold my hands up. ‘I’ve mellowed a bit and learned to control my temper. Although I say that at the start of every season and then get in trouble, so maybe I’ll take that back!’ With three Premiership titles in five years, as well as a European Cup final appearance, Cockerill has delivered enough silverware for the East Midlands giants to justify the touchline rants. He’s second only to Jim Mallinder at Northampton as the longest-serving director of rugby in the Aviva Premiership. But the 43-year-old, who made 262 first-team appearances for Leicester as a player after signing from Coventry in 1992, still received plenty of stick this summer after the Tigers failed to reach a play-off final for the first time in a decade. ‘Doing this job you have to develop a thick skin,’ he said. ‘Being a director of rugby is often a thankless task, especially at a club like Leicester where people expect you to win and if you don’t you get a load of stick. Richard Cockerill is second only to Jim Mallinder at Northampton as the longest-serving director of rugby in the Aviva Premiership . Ricahrd Cockerill made 27 appearances for England during his playing career . ‘So you just try to win because that’s what people demand. You’ll have to ask the RFU if I’ve upset them too much (to be England coach). I’ve never really been a career climber. I like going to work and doing what I do. Where that takes me, I don’t know. ‘All I care about is Leicester and I’m passionate about what I do. I make no apologies for that. Some coaches are happy to sit there and watch and be more composed but I like to get involved in what’s going on. I live every tackle and every pass. Whether I grow out of it at some point, who knows? I’m a young 43 and I want to win.’ Last season Leicester didn’t win enough. After failing to make a mark in Europe and losing to Northampton in the Premiership play-off semi-final, the flak flew over the summer, with Lewis Moody and Neil Back two of the high-profile ex-players to get stuck in. Moody argued skills coach Geordan Murphy should be given more involvement. Cockerill disagrees in typically forthright fashion. Richard Cockerill (centre) lines up with Darren Garforth (left) and Jason Leonard (right) for England in 1998 . ‘Lewis has got about as many brain cells as a bag of crisps,’ he says with a grin about a former team-mate he released in 2010 after 14 years at the club. ‘He has no idea what Geordan does. Lewis has just been a little bit inaccurate but only out of not knowing what day of the week it is.’ Today, Leicester take on Exeter at Sandy Park on the back of a 36-17 opening-day win over Newcastle Falcons. They will do so without club captain Ed Slater, who is out for the season with a cruciate ligament injury. Cockerill is a hard-nosed realist. Winning pays his bills, and Cockerill knows full well that if his team fail then the club he’s served faithfully for the best part of 22 years — bar a two-year sabbatical in Montferrand — will sack him. ‘This is not just a job for me,’ he said. ‘Some of the cultures we have in place I helped create when I was a player in the 1990s. I care deeply about the club. ‘But as we’ve seen with Dean Richards and John Wells, there are lots of coaches who’ve been players and been at Leicester a lot longer than I have who, when their time is up, their time is up. Thank you and goodbye. ‘The minute you can’t keep the club moving in a forward fashion is the moment you will get the tap on the shoulder. That’s OK. That’s life.’","The Leicester Tigers director has lost count of the times he's upset the RFU .

"By . Nick Mashiter, Press Association . Professional Cricketers' Association chief executive Angus Porter does not want the row over Moeen Ali's Edgbaston abuse to boil over, and claimed that the England spinner should take it 'as a positive'. Ali was booed by Indian fans during the hosts' T20 win in Birmingham on Sunday. His father Munir believed it was because of Moeen's Pakistani background, and police treated it as a 'non-crime hate related incident' after an official complaint from a spectator. Abuse: Moeen Ali was booed by Indian fans during the hosts' T20 win in Birmingham . 'His dad offered his view sincerely and I hope it doesn't stoke the fire because he was just standing up for his boy,' Porter said. 'There is an element of taking it as a compliment. You are more likely to boo someone when you think they are someone to be feared. 'Take it as as a positive, you'd rather be booed than ignored.' Porter added there was no place for any racial abuse but would be surprised if it had come from the Indian fans. 'It shouldn't happen but I have always found the Indians to be respectful and it is a little bit surprising in that respect,' he said. India's tour has been littered with ill-feeling, with Ravindra Jadeja booed by England fans after his clash with James Anderson in the Test series earlier in the summer. Spin: Angus Porter said that the abuse 'shouldn't happen' but said it was better than being 'ignored' Porter wants supporters to refrain from all types of abuse and appreciate the game instead. 'Supporters pay their money and they are entitled to express an opinion, but I don't think it's exclusively about Moeen,' he said. 'You see other players get booed. Jimmy Anderson gets booed when he goes to Yorkshire and it's disappointing when players are performing as entertainers and doing their best. It would be great if spectators saw the positives.' The police would need more evidence to pursue the issue and Moeen, who took one for 31 in the game which England won by three runs, does not want to make a complaint. Action: The police are treating the abuse as a non-crime related hate incident . Moeen's father Munir believes the booing had racial undertones and insisted the Birmingham-born spinner should not have to contend with any abuse. 'We are very disappointed with what happened. It should have been a special day,' he told ESPNcricinfo. 'Moeen was playing for his country in the city of his birth. It is the city I was born in and the city my mother was born in.

'We have experienced so much kindness and goodwill from all communities - Indian, British and Pakistani - in recent months, so it is disappointing that some supporters let their team down with this behaviour. There is still a problem with racism between Asian communities in the UK.'","Moeen Ali was booed by Indian fans at T20 win in Birmingham .

Thank goodness McIlroy did not feel the need to backtrack on Twitter. He was just  anxious to clear up any misconceptions. ‘Got a question today about Tiger and Phil,’ he tweeted. ‘Gave an honest answer, was very complimentary about the 2 best golfers of this generation….golfers on average have a 20-25 year career, both into the back 9 of their careers….don’t think there is anything wrong with saying that.’ There is not.

"London Welsh shipped a half-century of points for the second time in six days as Bath ran in seven tries as they claimed a 53-26 victory in front of a record crowd at the Recreation Ground. The visitors scored four tries themselves and showed far more heart in defence than in their traumatic 52-nil defeat at home to Exeter. But their return to the Premiership could hardly have begun more unpromisingly. Bath’s playmaker, George Ford, was near faultless from the kicking tee, missing only one conversion and also landing two penalties for an 18-point haul. Bath fly-half George Ford kicked 18 points during their dominant victory over London Welsh . His half-back partner, Chris Cook, given his first Premiership start, scored within two minutes and other tries followed from Semesa Rokoduguni (two), Jonathan Joseph (two), Leroy Houston and Carl Fearns. The Exiles tries were scored by Pete Browne, Seb Stegmann, Seb Jewell and Lachlan McCaffrey, with skipper Olly Barkley, who spent eight seasons in all at Recreation Ground, converting three. Cook’s try, after just 84 seconds, owed much to Fearns’ muscular burst through two tackles and Kyle Eastmond’s inside track in support. He was brought down just short of the posts by former Bath player Nick Scott but scrum-half Cook followed up to touch down and Ford added the conversion. London Welsh were back on terms within a couple of minutes as lock Browne finished off a move involving Barkley, Jewell and flanker McCaffrey - Barkley landed the extra points. Ford, who had kicked seven out of seven on the opening weekend at Sale, was accurate with an eighth-minute penalty, awarded for a scrum offence by Exiles’ tighthead Taione Vea. Given another straightforward chance, the young fly-half opted instead for a tap-and-go but Davey Wilson was stopped just of the line. Despite a decided advantage in the scrums, Bath’s attacking rhythm was being disrupted by knock-ons and spilled passes. Eventually, Ford rescued a faltering move on the Welsh 22, easing outside Browne’s flailing tackle to create the overlap for Rokoduguni to score in the right corner. There was a worrying moment or two for the Bath faithful as the fly-half received treatment on his shoulder but he banged over the conversion from the touchline to put Bath 17-7 ahead at the end of the first quarter. Semesa Rokuduguni was one of two players alongside Jonathan Joseph to score a brace of tries . Carl Fearns completed the try scoring for Bath at the Recreation Ground . Barkley missed a 45-metre penalty at the other end before Bath extended their lead with a third try on the half hour. The Welsh defence was a far more aggressive and capable unit this weekend but was undone, first by Anthony Watson’s dancing feet, and then by Joseph’s neat grubber, the centre snaffling the ball under Stegmann’s nose to touch down. Stegman quickly got his own back, wriggling out of Luke Arscott’s tackle to win the TMO decision and Barkley’s kick cut the margin to one score. But Ford ended the half with another penalty for a 27-14 lead. Within five minutes of the restart, number eight Houston profited from a catch-and-drive, with Ford accurate as ever from the tee. It looked as if they would score again straightaway but Stegmann led a rousing counter-attack and full-back Jewell cantered to the line at the other end. Bath responded with an intercept score by Rokoduguni as McCaffrey tried to offload in a tackle just outside his 22. But Bath were equally generous at the other end as replacement hooker Tom Dunn threw long on his own line and it was a relieved McCaffrey who snapped up the chance to earn a four-try bonus point. Rokoduguni’s pace and power had been a constant threat and after he had busted through the tiring Welsh defence on 71 minutes, Ford fed Joseph for his second try and Bath’s sixth. For once, the fly-half’s kick was off target - but only just. Fearns brought up the 50 by barging through to the posts from a tapped penalty.","Fly-half George Ford scores 18 points as Bath win comfortably .

"Australia survived a spirited Argentina fightback to claim their second win in the Rugby Championship at Robina Stadium. The hosts were looking to build on their victory over South Africa last time out, and things looked to be going their way when tries from Michael Hooper (two) and Peter Betham helped them open up a 28-13 lead by the hour mark. Marcelo Bosch and Julian Tuculet then replied to bring the Pumas within four points, but their late pressure failed to bring any rewards as they fell to a fourth successive loss. Wallabies captain Michael Hooper makes a break as Australia take on Argentina . Australia's Tevita Kuridrani is tackled by Argentina's Marcelo Bosch in the Rugby Championship match . The Wallabies made two enforced changes to their side, with number eight Ben McCalman replacing Wycliff Palu (concussion) and wing Betham coming in for Adam Ashley-Cooper (neck). Tatafu Polota-Nau was also back in the starting line-up at hooker. Argentina replaced Lucas Gonzalez Amorosino and Horacio Agulla with Juan Imhoff and Manuel Montero on the wings, while the suspended Tomas Lavanini made way for Matias Alemanno. Rain made for tricky conditions on the Gold Coast but that did not seem to bother Australia, who scored the opening try after just two minutes. Bernard Foley provided the telling pass for captain Hooper, who exploited a huge gap in the defence to dot down despite desperate late attempts to haul him back. Foley was wide with the conversion and that allowed the Pumas to go ahead five minutes later, when Montero burst down the touchline for their first try before Nicolas Sanchez added the extras. Fly-half Foley was more successful with the boot after 16 minutes, slotting a penalty to give the Wallabies the edge once more. Scott Fardy of Australia tackles Joaquin Tuculet of Argentina  at the CBUS Super Stadium . Australia's Sam Carter is tackled by Argentina's Ramiro Herrera on Saturday . And they remained in control, frustrated only by some solid Pumas defence and a number of telling errors which denied Rob Horne and Nick Phipps the chance to add their names to the scoresheet. Two penalties from Foley eventually gave Australia some breathing space at the interval, however, as they left the field 14-7 in front. That advantage was stretched three minutes into the second half as Hooper crossed for his second try of the match, collecting a loose ball after some sloppy Argentina defending before hurling himself across the line. Foley's conversion took the lead out to 14 points. Sanchez and Foley then traded penalties before the Argentina fly-half landed another kick to close the gap once more. However, Australia's response was swift, with Phipps playing in Betham for the winger to race down the touchline and cross at the corner flag. Israel Folau of Australia displays his athleticism as the full back takes a high ball . The Pumas rallied and Bosch broke through after 64 minutes for their second try to ignite hopes of a fightback, with Sanchez's conversion bringing the scores to 29-20. And home nerves were jangling further when Argentina crossed for a third try with nine minutes remaining. A lapse of concentration saw the Wallabies defence lose the ball and Sanchez played a chip through for Tuculet, closing the gap to just four points, although the conversion crucially hit the post. Another three-pointer from Foley six minutes from time eased some of the pressure, but the momentum was with the visitors in the dying stages. However, they missed the chance to cross again when Tomas Cubelli fumbled the ball with Imhoff in place to score under the posts.","Michael Hooper scores twice to help Australia to victory .

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) This is the first competitive meeting between Liverpool and Ludogorets. Liverpool have won six of their eight encounters with Bulgarian sides but lost the last one; a 0-1 defeat at home against CSKA Sofia in the 2005/06 Champions League qualifiers. That’s the last time a Bulgarian side won an away game against an English side in European competition. Ludogorets have only lost two of their last eight away games in European competition (W4 D2), both 1-0 defeats (against Valencia and Steaua Bucharest). Liverpool are taking part in the Champions League for the ninth time. Their last appearance in the competition was in 2009/10. Liverpool have won the European Cup/Champions League on five occasions: 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984 and 2005. Only Real Madrid (10) and AC Milan (7) have been more successful. Liverpool's last Champions League game came in 2009 when Fiorentina helped dump the Reds out the group stage with a 2-1 win at Anfield. Here Martin Jorgensen celebrates equalising for the Italian side on the night . In their last group stage appearance (2009/10), Liverpool never scored more than one goal in a game (five goals in six matches).

Ludogorets are one of two clubs to make their first Champions League appearance this season (since 1992/93), alongside Malmo. The only previous Bulgarian side to take part in the Champions League were Levski Sofia in 2006/07. They lost all six of their games, scoring one goal and conceding 17. Ludogorets beat Dudelange, Partizan Belgrade and Steaua Bucarest in the qualifiers to reach this season’s group stages.

Angel di Maria, Ander Herrera, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata brought the Old Trafford crowd to their feet on Sunday as they helped United to an easy 4-0 win over QPR. But the biggest cheer of the afternoon was reserved for Falcao when he came off the bench in the 67th minute.

The Colombian striker, who moved to United in a dramatic deadline-day switch from Monaco, was delighted to turn out for his new club for the first time. 'It felt good to make my debut at Old Trafford,' he said. 'It is an extraordinary stadium, a legendary stadium and I am happy to get the win. I will enjoy this moment.' Fifteen minutes after making his grand entrance, Falcao almost scored United's fifth. Robert Green spilled Daley Blind's drive and Falcao raced into the box to follow-up, but the QPR goalkeeper recovered just in time to block the former Porto man's shot. Robert Green charges out from his line to thwart Falcao as he looked set to score . His failure to score was the only negative for Falcao, who was overwhelmed by the reception the home fans gave him on his debut. 'I want to say thank you to the fans. I enjoyed the welcome a lot. It was fantastic,' he said . 'I almost scored. The goalkeeper was good. I hope to score the next game.' Marcos Rojo and Blind performed strongly on their debuts while Di Maria continued to prove why he is regarded as one of the best players on the planet with another impressive display. Falcao thinks United's six summer signings will get even better with time. 'Bit by bit we will gel together as a team and the new players will feel more comfortable,' he said. 'I hope everything continues for us like it did on Sunday.' Falcao is targeting his first United goal against Leicester City next weekend . Everton and Chelsea will present much tougher tests when they come to United over the course of the next month. But the optimism that swept through Old Trafford on Sunday will take some time to dampen. Herrera, making his return after a month-long ankle injury layoff, thinks United should be aiming as high as possible in the Premier League this year.

Captain Richie McCaw scored a second-half try to help the All Blacks maintain their five-year unbeaten record in New Zealand with a tense 14-10 victory over a combative Springboks side in the Rugby Championship in Saturday. McCaw was the beneficiary of a pin-point cross-kick from Aaron Cruden that was hauled in by number eight Kieran Read who fed his skipper who dived over in the corner. Cruden slotted two penalties for the home side while Beauden Barrett added another after he replaced Cruden late in the second half to give the home side 16 points at the top of the Rugby Championship table.

The All Blacks have been unbeaten in New Zealand for five years - a run of 36 successive tests - last losing at home to South Africa in Hamilton on Sept. 12, 2009. The hosts dominated the first half, playing all the rugby deep inside Springboks' territory only to be stymied by a brilliant defensive effort, especially on the tryline. Such was the territorial dominance the All Blacks enjoyed in the first half that in the first 20 minutes of the game they had spent almost eight inside the Springboks' 22-metre area.

At the same time of the match, the Springboks had spent around 50 seconds in the All Blacks' 22-metre area, during which they scored a brilliant try to Hendricks, who came off the right wing and took the inside pass from Pollard. Despite dominating the territory and possession, the home side's only reward was two penalties to Cruden in the first half, though he missed a third from long range after the halftime hooter had sounded. McCaw then scored in the corner after a sustained buildup that culminated in Cruden making a pinpoint cross kick to Read, who took the ball and waited for McCaw to pop up outside him and dive over. Pollard slotted a long-range drop goal in the 56th minute but missed a 50-metre penalty seven minutes later after the All Blacks were again penalised at the break down.

"By . Adam Shergold At St Andrews . Alex Mowatt secured a merited point for Leeds United as they came from behind against Birmingham to continue their recovery under caretaker manager Neil Redfearn. It took the Yorkshire side a long time to get going at St Andrews but a strong second half performance strengthened Redfearn’s chances of getting the job on a full-time basis. Owner Massimo Cellino, sat in the stands, looked elated when Mowatt showed strength and perseverance inside the box to hold off the blue-shirted defenders and roll the ball into the far corner. Wes Thomas scored the opening goal at St Andrews as Birmingham took on Leeds in the Championship . Wes Thomas's left footed shot was so fierce it broke the back of the net, causing a delay .

Substitutes not used: S Taylor, Wootton, Cooper, Tonge, Adryan . Scorer: Mowatt 75 . Referee: Scott Duncan . Attendance: 15,266 . Leeds had trailed thanks to a “netbuster” from Wes Thomas late in the first half. It wasn’t a netbuster by the standard definition - as in an unstoppable screamer of a shot - but rather because it did, quite literally, break the net. Taking in a cleverly disguised pass from Brek Shea, Thomas spun into space inside the area and finished adeptly past goalkeeper Marco Silvestri. But the ball’s impact snapped the net from its stanchion and nine farcical minutes followed as ground staff scrambled to find a replacement. It caused great amusement to the large Leeds United travelling contingent behind the broken goal and was their highlight in a depressing first half in which they failed to muster a meaningful shot on goal. However, things improved after the break and Leeds might have snatched all three points had other chances - from Mowatt and Souleymane Doukara - found the net. Birmingham players celebrate the opening goal during their Championship match . Neil Redfearn is in temporary charge of Leeds after David Hockaday left the club last month . Equally, they may have left with nothing as a late Birmingham onslaught led to substitute Demarai Gray being booked for diving after a clumsy challenge from Giuseppe Bellusci inside the box. As the home fans begged the referee, replays suggested they had a case and the hosts went close again in stoppage time when Silvestri spread himself to deny Gray in a one-on-one. The first half had been low key, with Shea, signed on a three-month loan from Stoke during the week, offering the greatest impetus with his forward runs and passing. Birmingham approached the game having won only one (Brighton at home) of their last five league games . He tried his luck from range early on with Silvestri only managing to gather his powerful effort at the second attempt. Bellusci, who looked an accident waiting to happen at times, nearly scored a spectacular own goal when a routine clearing header from Darren Randolph’s long free-kick almost flew past his own keeper. With the midfield uncreative and Billy Sharp failing to fire, it took Leeds 34 minutes to muster their first chance. Mirco Antenucci, who always seemed five yards offside, curling over the bar. Thomas’s goal was well deserved on the balance of play and Shea’s neat assist a highlight on his first St Andrews start. Birmingham's David Davis challenges Casper Sloth during their match at St Andrews . Lee Clark's Birmingham finished just outside the relegation places on goal difference last season . Birmingham, who entered the match just a place above the drop zone, retreated after the break and Leeds seized the initiative. Mowatt’s long-range shot was parried away by Randolph and sub Doukara fired a low effort just wide of the post. Their equaliser was deserved when it arrived with a quarter-hour to play and, in the week Cellino suggested he might look within Elland Road for his next boss, he may just have a good case.","Birmingham beat Leeds 1-1 at St Andrews .

"By . Kieran Gill for MailOnline . Follow @@kie1410 . For some, playing for England means everything. An honour, a duty, a reward, call it what you will. Cy Goddard, however, is a 17-year-old youth product of Tottenham Hotspur who disagrees, having pledged his allegiance to Japan after politely declining advances from England scouts. The half-Japanese, half-English attacking midfielder has grown up admiring the Samurai Blue way while learning his trade at Tottenham, a club that prides itself on nurturing players of flair. Citizenship in football often sparks debates - as it did with Belgium's Adnan Januzaj - yet for Goddard, who takes Japanese lessons twice a week, it’s as simple a decision as they come. VIDEO Scroll down to see Cy Goddard  trick his way to a shot and score for Japan's U16s . Talent: Cy Goddard, a 17-year-old youth product of Tottenham Hotspur, has chosen Japan over England . Adnan Januzaj (Belgium) Victor Moses (Nigeria) Shola Ameobi (Nigeria) Simone Perrotta (Italy) Lewis Holtby (Germany) ‘I have never really wanted to play for England,’ says Goddard, who grew up in south London. ‘Always my mindset was that I wanted to play for Japan. Since I was 10, it's always been an ambition of mine. ‘If they keep progressing as quickly, then they will be better than England and a lot of nations in the future. I think a lot of the boys (in this country's youth system) are also looking elsewhere rather than England. 'A lot of people in the youth system are not really admiring the England team and the English way of playing football. For me, I have always pictured myself playing for Japan.’ So much so that Goddard, when visiting his grandparents near Ohori Park in the Japanese city of Fukuoka, would buy a new Japan kit every year. Goddard’s father, Steve, is an artist from England but it is his mother, Sawako, who makes him eligible to play for Japan. Despite straying from his father’s profession, the attacking midfielder exhibits a similar creativity in his style of play, which has led to interest from Borussia Dortmund. In action: Goddard takes Japanese lessons twice a week after training and turned down playing for England . Challenge: Japan suits the creative style of the attacking midfielder more and the starlet rightfully agrees . Jonathan Bond, Watford (also eligible for Wales) Michael Keane, Burnley, on loan from Man Utd (also eligible for  Republic of Ireland) Tyler Blackett, Man Utd (also eligible for Barbados or Jamaica) Nathaniel Chalobah, Burnley, on loan from Chelsea (also eligible for Sierra Leone) Harry Kane, Tottenham (also eligible for Republic of Ireland) In 2013 Goddard made his international debut for Japan's Under-16s at the Montaigu Tournament in France after impressing scouts from the Japanese Football Association that were touring Europe for talent. They, like Tottenham, were intrigued by Goddard's technical ability, and were in no way deterred by the pint-sized starlet's  frame. Goddard, yet to master the Japanese language, admits being lost in translation was a burden but he found a way around it. Again, creativity was shown. ‘I was nervous. You are thrown into a whole different situation that you haven’t experienced,’ Goddard  tells Sportsmail. ‘I’m not the best at speaking Japanese, but I was able to settle in really well. They helped me with tactics, and other things you come to understand as you play. 'You can also understand through hand signals. If I wanted them to pass, I would just say “Yeah” in English.’ It isn’t anything new. Germany’s Miroslav Klose, the World Cup’s all-time top goalscorer, was born in Poland but the striker succumbed to his new land. Artwork: A fan made this poster for Goddard after his international debut at the 2013 Montaigu Tournament . John Barnes (was also eligible for Jamaica, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) Wilfried Zaha (was also eligible for Ivory Coast) Raheem Sterling (was also eligible for Jamaica) Owen Hargreaves (was also eligible for Canada or Wales) Matt Le Tissier (was also eligible for Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland) In England there has been Nigeria’s Victor Moses, who previously represented the Young Lions across four youth levels, and the more recent  case of Belgium’s  Januzaj. For now Goddard is simply keen to concentrate on his Tottenham career, hoping a senior contract is in the pipeline, but then what for the tricky two-footed forward? ‘I would like to go out and play in Japan one day,’ continues Goddard. ‘When I went to Japan and saw the crowds, I was impressed. 'They are just so passionate, similar to Italian fans. It is a great environment if you are playing in front of that crowd. ‘One of my ambitions is to represent Japan in a massive tournament, but I think that is a bit too far in the future to think about at the moment.’ Until then, Goddard, who has drawn comparisons to Dortmund's newest No 7 Shinji Kagawa, will continue to learn the language. The starlet remains eligible for England at senior level but hopes to one day be a part of the Japanese team he's admired from afar for more than a decade.","Cy Goddard bravely turned down  England and represented Japan's Under-16s after being called up in 2013 - despite not knowing the language .

"By . Adam Shergold for the Daily Mail . Neil Redfearn knew the question was coming, and when it did he saw no reason to go all coy and cagey. Why would he? This was another Saturday, another positive performance and another important point picked up by the Leeds United ‘caretaker’. So when pressed on whether he was enjoying all this and whether he might just be tempted to make a permanent living out of one of the toughest jobs in English football, Redfearn sent a clear message to owner Massimo Cellino. Leeds United caretaker Neil Redfearn is hopeful of being handed the manager's job full-time . Alex Mowatt scored Leeds United's goal against Birmingham at St Andrew's on Saturday . ‘He knows I’m capable,’ he said, eyes lighting up. ‘I enjoyed the second half today.’ Then after a pause he added: ‘I enjoyed the first half as well. Because you’re in charge of something that’s really good.’ Redfearn, 49, has sat in this hotseat twice before; when Simon Grayson was sacked in February 2012 and when Neil Warnock departed in April 2013. So he was the obvious person to turn to when Cellino lost patience with David Hockaday — after just six competitive matches — at the end of August. Redfearn, who came to Elland Road as academy team boss in January 2009, has been a rock of permanence amid the choppy waters of the frequent managerial and ownership changes at Elland Road over the last five years. So when Hockaday went, he delegated his work with the kids to others and, like a trusty substitute teacher, stepped in to the interim job once again. Only this time it feels different. When Leeds beat Bolton before the international break, Cellino praised the ‘beautiful football’ he had witnessed and added: ‘I’ve decided to leave the team to Neil.’ It has been a difficult few months for Leeds United, and Alex Mowatt's goal gained them a much-needed point . Alex Mowatt lines up the shot that saw Leeds draw level at St Andrews on Saturday . The Italian, wearing designer shades as he watched his team from the stands, celebrated madly as Alex Mowatt earned Leeds a merited point and extended Birmingham’s poor start to the season. And there’s no doubt who Cellino would have phoned on Saturday night. ‘He speaks to me about what we did in training, the team and how it’s evolving,’ Redfearn said. ‘He’s a real football nut and we can be on the phone for an hour, hour-and-a-half talking football.’ It sounds like it’s meant to be. Redfearn seems to have the trust and the ear of a man who crashed his way through 36 managers in 22 years at Cagliari. But the job security isn’t quite there yet. When questioned if he would be in charge of Leeds for tomorrow’s trip to Bournemouth, he said sharply: ‘Yes, unless you know anything different.’ Leeds looked much improved at Birmingham. They did start sluggishly and trailed when Wes Thomas fired home seven minutes before half-time, but roared back after Redfearn had delivered his half-time team talk. Birmingham's Clayton Donaldson (centre) shoots at the Leeds goal . While Redfearn waits for Cellino’s number to flash up, Birmingham boss Lee Clark said he would be placing a call to David Allison, the man who appoints referees to Football League matches. Clark was furious after Scott Duncan waved away appeals for a stoppage-time penalty when the lively Demarai Gray fell under a clumsy challenge from Giuseppe Bellusci. ‘I ring him more than my wife. I think she is getting a bit jealous to be honest with you,’ he said, only half-joking. ‘I don’t want my young, exciting player, who beats people for fun, with ease, to lose confidence and stop doing it because he’s worried about getting a yellow card.’ Clark could have done with the spot-kick. Birmingham have won just once at home in their last 22 league matches going back to October. A travelling contingent of 2,654 boosted the crowd to a still-paltry 15,266 — empty blue seats very nearly outnumbering the fans. But just one seat would suit Redfearn right now — the manager’s.","Neil Redfearn has been in charge at Leeds since the end of August .

"By . Tom Kelly . Updated: . 10:32 EST, 13 January 2014 . A student whose boyfriend secretly bombarded her with sexually explicit photos for over three years yesterday told of her ‘sustained mental torture'. Ruth Jeffery said she never believed Shane Webber could be behind the ‘vile and malicious’ hate campaign and assumed she was the victim of a sinister mystery stalker. Her unemployed boyfriend even posted naked images of her on adult websites and sent them to her family and friends, including her horrified parents. Stalker and his prey: Shane Webber, left, was jailed today at Southampton Magistrate's Court for his campaign against ex-girlfriend Ruth Jeffery, left . Ultimate betrayal: Shane Webber's online harassment made girlfriend Ruth Jeffery so ill she was prescribed anti-depressants and aborted their unborn child . The 22-year-old university student said the ordeal made her suicidal and caused her to abort their unborn child. He claimed that . he had started the harassment after the abortion - although Miss . Jeffery's family insist the stalking began long before the abortion, and . that that was . the reason she had the termination. Her mother Elaine, 49, said: ‘She was . so distressed by what had happened she could not go through with the . pregnancy. She feared her stress would harm the baby.’ Today, after watching in court as . Webber was jailed for four months, Miss Jeffery called for a new law to . crackdown on internet stalking. She said: ‘The whole thing was cruel and calculated. Far from suspecting him, I went to him for support. 'I shared everything with him. He was a normal, caring boyfriend, or so I thought. Depression: The 22-year-old university student said the ordeal made her suicidal and caused her to abort their unborn child . Review needed: Miss Jeffery says the law needs to be re-examined to take into account Webber's new and very disturbing form of harassment . ‘I cannot put into words how . devastated I felt when I found out Shane was responsible. I thought . there must have been some mistake. I still find it hard to comprehend . now. ‘It was absolutely vicious. He intentionally controlled me, he belittled me and he and harmed me. 'He put me through a sustained mental torture. 'He has wrecked the past three-and-a- half years of my life. I felt watched the whole time. ‘I would argue with my parents when they told me they believed it was Shane. 'Stressed': Miss Jeffery was badly affected by her boyfriend's online abuse campaign . ‘My confidence dropped completely and I found I couldn’t do simple things. ‘I am sure there are still pictures out there of me online and it will be difficult to take them down. ‘I am happy that Webber has been . jailed, but I think the law needs to be reviewed to take into account . this new and very disturbing form of harassment and stalking. ‘I’m sure there must be many more victims like me who are too afraid to report it or fear they will not be taken seriously. ‘It’s time for Parliament to look at the whole situation and update the law to act as a deterrent and protect victims.’ Miss Jeffery urged anyone suffering from internet stalking to report it immediately and keep a diary of the abuse. Clue: Miss Jeffery eventually realised that some of the detail in the messages could only be known to Webber . The couple met at school in Nottingham and got together as teenagers before Miss Jeffery moved with her family to Southampton. The relationship with Webber continued when she later moved to Loughborough to study computing science. But unknown to Miss Jeffery, Webber . posted up to 12 images of a nude or sexual nature of his girlfriend, and . also of himself with her, on to social networking sites including . Facebook, Southampton Magistrates’ Court heard. One batch in April 2011 was called Nude Jeffery and was sent to many close friends and family. Online campaign: Images of Webber and his girlfriend. He hacked into her email account and sent a naked picture of her to her contact list, including her father . Frank Richardson, prosecuting, said: ‘She had no knowledge that Shane Webber was sending these images to her friends.' When she asked him about images that . only he would have access to, he claimed one of his friends had stolen . the photos from his computer which led to the innocent man’s arrest. ‘That was manipulation, that was control, that was mind control,’ Mr Richardson said. Webber even went online posing as Miss Jeffery. He contacted men saying she was . sexually attracted to them and gave them her university address. One man . turned up at her student house and had to be turned away. Eventually her father, Gordon, made . his own investigation and traced the postings to a site registered to . Webber and he was arrested and interviewed by police. Evil campaign: Webber continued to stalk his girlfriend despite knowing that it was making her ill . In mitigation, Janet Grey said that Webber had Asperger’s syndrome and had not realised the impact of what he was doing. She said earlier press reports about Webber’s stalking had helped him to understand how badly he had behaved. ‘Being dogged by the press and being . called a ""sicko"" has had an impact on him and he now realises the . devastating impact he had on Ruth and her family. That must be a good thing.’ Webber, who admitted one count of harassment, sat emotionless in the dock drinking water throughout the hearing. Sentencing him, District Judge . Anthony Callaway said: ‘This was a gross breach of trust against a . former girlfriend who you had known for a number of years and who was . pregnant with your child. ‘The type of harassment represents a . gross violation of her privacy and in circumstances nobody, man, woman, . let alone a youngster at university, should be obliged to experience.’ Webber’s mother sat weeping at the back of the court throughout the hearing and blew him a kiss as he was led down to the cells.","Shane Webber sent naked pictures of girlfriend to friends and family .

Federer tweeted a picture with the former basketball great on Monday and Jordan was in the Swiss star's box as he opened his campaign at Flushing Meadows with a 6-3 6-4 7-6 (7/4) win over Marinko Matosevic. Federer arrived in New York brimming with confidence after reaching the final at his last four tournaments and winning his first Masters title for two years in Cincinnati last weekend.

In form: Federer has reached the final in the last four tournaments he has taken part in . Australian Matosevic, who has acquired the nickname 'Mad Dog', is a feisty competitor but it was not long before he was being forced to admire Federer's shots. Matosevic did a pretty good job of holding onto his serve under pressure but Federer finally broke through to lead 5-3 in the first set and then did so again in the seventh game of the second. Federer was really turning on the style by this point, and a 'tweener' shot between his legs that hit Matosevic had Jordan in stitches. When Federer broke serve again in the seventh game of the third set, it appeared the end was nigh, and Matosevic tried to lighten his darkening mood by engaging with Jordan, pointing at him and saying, 'I just want to be like Mike'.

I have never been to watch golf live before,’ Murray said ‘So, you know, for a first experience, watching the best player in the world was pretty good. ‘I really enjoyed it. I guess it’s like pretty much any sport — when you watch them up close it’s impressive. Then in the evening, I went to the basketball, which I love watching. But this time to sit that close and see those guys. . . they’re huge guys, but just unbelievably quick, great athletes.It was a fun day for me.’ Murray may be an avid sports fan but that passion will probably not extend to watching his mother Judy in Strictly Come Dancing, after it was confirmed this week that she will take part in this winter’s competition. ‘I mean, if it makes her happy, then I will support her,’ he smiled. ‘I’m not really into those shows, but she loves it. I mean, she watches it all the of the time, talks about it all the time. So, yeah, if she enjoys it, then I’m happy for her. I don’t believe I have ever seen her dance, to be honest. It will be interesting.’ The serious business starts tomorrow for the now No 8 seed, when he takes on Dutchman Robin Haase in the Louis Armstrong Stadium, where he has had plenty of difficult matches before. Joking aside: Andy Murray and Amelie Mauresmo have enjoyed a relaxed relationship . Scowl: Andy Murray lost to Roger Federer in the quarter-finals of the Cincinnati Masters . Haase described his knee as being like that of a 60 or 70-year-old, but he can manage the condition. He expressed surprise that Murray has hired Amelie Mauresmo as coach, although not because she is a woman. ‘For me it’s a surprise that many tennis players work with ex-tennis players now . . . for example, I wouldn’t work with an ex-professional just because they have no experience as a coach. ‘When you are No 1, 2 or 3 in the world, you want to improve maybe those things you can only find in an ex-player so I totally understand, and if that’s a woman or a man, I think that doesn’t make a huge difference. I would have never done it, although that’s me.” Murray has enjoyed her more consensual, attentive approach but his fellow former Wimbledon champion from last year, Marion Bartoli, is warning against people misinterpreting Mauresmo as some kind of soft touch. ‘She is not someone who is soft all the time, definitely not,’ said Bartoli — commentating for Sky this week — who has been coached herself by Mauresmo. ‘If something was wrong she was making her point strongly that it was wrong and that I or my team-mates needed to correct it. She is not a soft person, maybe she is making you feel comfortable but when you weren’t doing your best or I was having a lack of concentration she made sure I was back on track, really making a point of it. Let's celebrate:  Mauresmo helped guide Marion Bartoli (right) to the Wimbledon title in 2013 . Girl power: Heather Watson will be flying the flag for Britain's female players at Flushing Meadows . ‘I can only speak from my own experience but when I was with her at a Fed Cup tie or some time together at Wimbledon she’s very funny and can make a few jokes. It was an easy relationship and the flow was going extremely well, but then again when it was out on court it was all about concentration and making sure everyone was focused on the goal of winning the match. ‘There was a time for fun and a time for business and she was able to separate the two.’ Bartoli always expected Mauresmo to require ‘two to three months’ to settle in with Murray as she would need to learn about the men’s tour. ‘The men’s and women’s games are different but I do think people should be judged on their ability to do the job. For me it’s never been a problem of female or male in coaching, it’s more about your own capabilities.’ In the absence of Laura Robson, who is still recovering from her long-term wrist injury, Heather Watson will fly the British flag in the women’s singles in the company of Johanna Konta. Watson, who plays Romania’s Sorana Cirstea, has improved this summer after last year’s bout of glandular fever, to the point where she is ranked 45 in the world. The Briton — who recently beat the world No 12 Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia — feels much happier about her prospects than she was 12 months ago. She said: ‘I was kind of dreading my match then because I came in with zero matches, but I’m a different player now, more aggressive and my confidence is up.

"By . Nick Mashiter, Press Association . Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke has hinted he is ready to return to training and bring an end to his five month injury nightmare. The 23-year-old ruptured his Achilles in April, forcing him to miss Belgium's World Cup campaign. However, he tweeted on Sunday he is looking forward to 'the big day' as he gears up for a Villa comeback. Christian Benteke is close to returning to training after five months out with an Achilles injury . Benteke wrote: '5months today! The road was long but tomorrow it's the big day! Doing what I love the most. Thank you for all the support you're the best.' The forward was expected to return in September, with boss Paul Lambert confirming his recovery was going well. He has been working with private physio Lieven Maesschalk, who revealed Benteke is closing in on playing again. The 23-year-old ruptured his Achilles in April, forcing him to miss Belgium's World Cup campaign . Maesschalk told Sporza: 'Over the past five months Christian worked very hard. His rehabilitation was done in phases. 'Alternately he worked at the club and in my practice. The hard work has paid off because Christian is now finally back to his club. 'Initially he worked off running sessions but now he is training with the group. Again, everything is going as desired. I expect him to return by the end of the month.'

"By . Stephen Mcgowan for the Daily Mail . Peter Lawwell has urged Celtic fans to stick by the Parkhead club during what he called a ‘period of transition’. The Scottish champions’ end-of-year financial results showed an £11.2million pre-tax profit — up from last year’s figure of £9.74m. And those figures will prompt fresh debate over the club’s transfer strategy after they crashed out of the Champions League amidst claims they could have spent more on players. Peter Lawwell (left) pictured at the unveiling of Ronny Deila as the club's manager . Reiterating a previous assertion that the plc board ‘reinvest every penny’ in the club, however, chief executive Lawwell attributed the Champions League failure to a change in management at the club, saying: ‘The appointment of Ronny Deila, a young manager with progressive ideas, marked the beginning of a period of transition for the club. ‘The board will support Ronny and his coaching team in the transfer market and in the development of the football operation generally. ‘The board’s commitment is clear. The board will re-invest every penny received back into the club for the longer term. 'We will continue to invest, not only in our own academy but also to scour the world for talent to develop and to make a difference at the club. ‘We cannot, however, put into jeopardy the long-term future of this club or its supporters with reckless spending. ‘The recent result in the qualifiers for the group stage for the Champions League and some results in the SPFL have been disappointing. 'Football success is crucial to the club, but the experience of the appointments of Martin O’ Neill, Gordon Strachan and Neil Lennon shows us that time is needed to develop through periods of transition.’ While the profit figure will grab the headlines, Celtic’s revenues were down by 14.6 per cent to £64.7m in a year when the team reached the Champions League group stage and season-ticket holders were handed a £100 price cut. Peter Lawwell has called on the Celtic fans to stick by their club as they go through a stage of transition . On June 30, the club had £4m in the bank, with chairman Ian Bankier insisting the club will ‘live within (their) means’ in an impoverished Scottish marketplace. ‘The board is highly conscious of the financial environment in which we play football here in Scotland,’ he said. ‘The harsh reality is that the total income from broadcasting rights available to the Scottish game is a tiny fraction of what is available to our neighbours in England. ‘Within this context and in the face of these hard facts, the Board has evolved the strategy that the club, financially, has to adopt a self-sustaining model. In plain words, we have to live within our means. We cannot spend money that we don’t have.’ The figures came as Deila admitted it would be a ‘disaster’ if the club failed to win a fourth successive title. Ronny Delia vents his frustration out during Celtic's game with Dundee earlier this season . Aberdeen, the club expected to pose the greatest challenge to the Premiership champions, travel to Glasgow today. And Deila plans to throw recovered captain Scott Brown and new signings John Guidetti, Stefan Scepovic into his reshaped side following a stuttering start to the season. Celtic have won just four of their 10 competitive games so far, crashing out of the Champions League twice. Conceding his real task is to steady the ship and retain the title, however, the Norwegian coach admitted: ‘I know it’s going to be tough in the first year, I have been through it before at smaller clubs. It’s always tough. ‘But I have done it before and the fun part will come. To get there we need results. We need to win. ‘But I have a very good squad and if we don’t win the league it is a disaster. I know what the players can do and they know it, too. We have to keep working.’","Bhoys chief executive Peter Lawwell has called on the club's fans to stick by the club in what is a period of transition .

"By . Jonny Singer for MailOnline . Follow @@Jonny_Singer . Celtic's Manchester City loanee John Guidetti gave a demonstration of his considerable talents by scoring a brilliant free-kick for Sweden's under-21 side on Friday night. The 22-year-old, who moved to Celtic Park last week, has made just one first team appearance for City since joining as a teenager seven years ago. But he showed why he is rated so highly by the Manchester club when he scored with a fabulous strike from 30 yards. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Guidetti's super-strike against Greece .

The Swedish star smashed the ball over the wall and got it to swerve and dip into the corner, in a style reminiscent of Cristiano Ronaldo.

He had a far more prolific spell with Feyenoord three years ago when he notched 20 goals in 23 appearances.
