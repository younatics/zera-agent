"A streaker sparked a mass brawl after running on to the pitch at a University rugby match to tackle an opposition player. The match between Newcastle University and Northumbria was coming to an end when the man, whose identity is not known, wandered on to the pitch with no clothes on. Without wanting to disrupt the flow of play, the man instead lined up in the Northumbria back-line, and assisted with a tackle to rapturous applause at Kingston Park. VIDEO: Scroll down to see the streaker in action during the University rugby match . The naked man ran onto the pitch at Kingston Park as the match between Newcastle University and Northumbria came to an end . After lining himself up with Northumbria, the prankster made a tackle towards an opposition player . But within seconds players from opposing teams started fighting, leaving the streaker able to make a quick exit without getting caught up in the scuffle. Tongan international rugby player Willis Koloofai said: 'I’ve played a lot of rugby, but I’ve never seen anything like this before. 'The guy had so much time on the pitch, about 4 minutes to do what he wanted! 'The atmosphere was pretty good in the stadium as you’d expect between two rival Universities, but when he ran on, it got even more charged - it was so entertaining. 'He lined up as if he belonged there as Northumbria’s 16th man, crouched down on his knees. Then as the ball came near him, he executed a textbook tackle on the Newcastle kid! As the two teams fall into a pitch-side scuffle, the prankster makes a quick exit before coming to any harm . The practical joke was filmed by a spectator who said he had never seen anything like it before . 'Then there was just a massive rumble between the two teams - Newcastle were probably a bit annoyed at the extra defence that Northumbria suddenly had! 'I was watching it with some of the Falcons boys and we found it hilarious - we had no idea where the security was though.' Eventually, play was resumed, with Northumbria running out 29-10 winners to continue their good form over their arch rivals.","University rugby match between local rivals Newcastle and Northumbria was halted when a naked streaker came on to the field of play .

"England footballer Adam Lallana has been given permission for a controversial all-weather football pitch in his back garden, but has been told he cannot put up floodlights. The Liverpool midfielder outraged neighbours earlier this year after building a £40,000 pitch in his back garden without planning permission. But it seems the dispute is now over after back-dated consent was granted by East Dorset District Council for the play area which he intends to use for kickabouts with his two-year-old son, Arthur. England footballer Adam Lallana has been given permission for a controversial all-weather football pitch in his back garden, but has been told he cannot put up floodlights . Mr Lallana upset some of his neighbours in the village of Ringwood, on the border of Hampshire and Dorset, in June when he built the games area, which included a pitch, basketball nets and zip wire, in the garden of his £1.5million five-bed home . Mr Lallana upset some of his neighbours in the village of Ringwood, on the border of Hampshire and Dorset, in June when he built the games area, which included a pitch, basketball nets and zip wire, in the garden of his £1.5million five-bed home. The council ruled that the England international needed permission for supports for the zip wire tower and basketball hoops because of their height. Mr Lallana then retrospectively applied for permission and it has now been granted. But planning officer Neil Lancaster warned: 'One of the concerns which could change the character of the area would be the installation of floodlights, so we are suggesting that there should be a condition against it.' The council planning committee was told this week that since the original complaints, a large amount of landscaping and planting had been carried out. Councillors heard that the fencing round the pitch was now largely screened by a two-metre holly hedge, the boundary with the immediate neighbouring property now had four-metre red cedar trees, and further landscaping was planned. The Liverpool and England midfielder outraged neighbours earlier this year after building a £40,000 pitch in his back garden without planning permission . Neighbour Brian Riley said the development had a significant effect on the health and quality of life of him and his wife Constance, since it could be clearly seen from their house. He said in June: 'We didn’t object to this application, why would we? We understand kids need somewhere to play. 'But then we saw builders and welders arrive on site and we couldn’t work out what was going on. We saw this sports pitch being built and we just couldn’t believe it. 'The council enforcement officer told us it was more in-keeping with a council play park than a garden in a special character area, which this area is.' But Peter Roberts, whose home is 150ft away, said he backed Mr Lallana. 'There is already very little view of the structures from any angle, and within the next 12 months the Lallanas will have a beautiful garden and imaginative play area for their family,' he said. Mike Hirsh, a planning consultant acting for Mr Lallana, said: 'He needed [planning permission] for two sections of fencing, which he was granted. 'There is still a little landscaping to do but the work is done now.'","Adam Lallana built an £40,000 all-weather football pitch in his garden in June .

"'I probably kept the score under the 30s' is probably one of the least likely post-match conversations to be had by goalkeepers around the world. But, for one, it was his silver lining after his team got thrashed 22-0 on Sunday, in what was the team's biggest defeat in its history. Non-league Cheadle Town's spanking even ended up trending on Twitter after the friendly against Russia's Under-19s started to resemble a rugby score. Scroll down for video . Cheadle Town could do little to prevent Russia's Under-19 national side storming to an incredible 22-0 win . Cheadle, seventh in the North West Counties League first division, suffered their heaviest defeat in history . The Stockport-based club, which plays in the North West Counties Football League, secured the prestigious fixture through club contacts and faced the team of international starlets at Park Road Stadium in Cheshire. However, the friendly turned into somewhat of a disaster after the home side started to concede goals every couple of minutes during the 90-minute match. Cheadle were 1-0 down after four minutes and 2-0 down by 13 minutes. From there the floodgates opened and Russia were 9-0 up at half-time. The club's Twitter feed started trending on social media throughout the country as each goal scored was posted - punctuated with just one reference to the home side which exclaimed: 'We've got a corner!!'. To many fans' amazement, the club's final Tweet read: 'FT: Cheadle Town 0-22 Russia U19.' Despite the battering, goalkeeper Steve Piggott - a 35-year-old truck driver - said the team can take 'plenty of positives from the game' including his 'world class' saves. News of Cheadle's thrashing quickly circulated on Twitter on Sunday, sending it to the top of the trending list . The club has decided to make the most of the 22-0 defeat by celebrating their Twitter followers doubling . He told The Independent: 'I pulled off a few good saves, maybe some world class ones. I probably kept the score under the 30s. 'The Russians seemed to have the wind behind them. Every shot they had in the first half seemed to hit the target. Twitter saw 8,800 retweets for the full-time score . 'Some of the lads' heads did begin to drop but I tried to keep their heads up and told them to keep going. 'There were a lot of tired legs and a few niggling injuries. We had some young players in and we weren't all used to playing together. He also said the Russian team was 'very professional' by continuing to play to full strength and not slacking off after the score hit double figures. Karl Florczak, Cheadle Town's website and social media manager, said it was the heaviest defeat in the club's history. Speaking to BBC Radio 5Live, he said: 'We played Dinamo Bucharest in a pre-season summer friendly, and there was a contact who got back in touch with us and said the Russia U19 side were knocking around in the North West and would we like to play them. 'If you are a football club at level 10 of the pyramid and someone approaches you and asks if you would like to have a go at the Russia U19s then you are not going to turn them down. 'To the best of my knowledge it is the heaviest defeat in the club's history. But in the club's defence we have three squads, the 1st XI, the reserves and also the U21s. All three squads had matches this weekend and what we put out was a bit of a scratch squad. 'To be fair, the Russia U19s were technically superb and even if we had put out our strongest XI then we would still have been on the end of a very severe beating.' Cheadle went 1-0 down after four minutes and were 9-0 down by half-time in the club's biggest defeat in history . Goalkeeper Steve Piggott - a 35-year-old truck driver - said they can take 'plenty of positives from the game' He added: 'Time will tell how the players will take it. They were frustrated halfway through the game, but there were a few smiles at the end, but I think we need to have a word with them before Wednesday night and remind them that it was the Russia U19 national side. 'It was a one-touch football master class. It was superb to watch for the neutral to watch, but it was not great for me as I was tweeting every goal as they went in.' 04 MINS: 0-1 . 13 MINS: 0-2 . 18 MINS: 0-3 . 25 MINS: 0-4 . 30 MINS: 0-5 . 33 MINS: 0-6 . 38 MINS: 0-7 . 42 MINS: 0-8 . 44 MINS: 0-9 . 46 MINS: 0-10 . 47 MINS: 0-11 . 50 MINS: 0-12 . 54 MINS: 0-13 . 57 MINS: 0-14 . 62 MINS: 0-15 . 67 MINS: 0-16 . 68 MINS: 0-17 . 69 MINS: 0-18 . 73 MINS: 0-19 . 76 MINS: 0-20 . 80 MINS: 0-21 . 83 MINS: 0-22 . However, he did take one positive from the game – the fact the club's Twitter followers doubled by the end of the match. 'Before the game we had the region of 1,500 twitter followers, now we are knocking on the door of 3,000,' he said. 'When I posted the full time score of 22-0 it was retweeted 5,000 times.' The club's Twitter followers were quick to join in with the fun and hundreds posted tongue-in-cheek comments. Conor Lynn said: 'Dust yourselves down and go out again next week,' while fan Tommy said: 'Definitely deserved something from this. Gutted with the result.' And Declan Taggart joked: 'Russia just edged it on the day.' The club, based at the Park Road Stadium, first formed in 1961 as Grasmere Rovers. They currently sit in sixth place in the North West Counties Football League after six games.","Cheadle Town suffered embarrassing defeat in  Russia Under-19s friendly .

"Staff at a boarding school for children from military families have been accused of creating a ‘climate of fear’ in which pupils were kept in solitary confinement. Children were also made to sit on a hard chair facing a wall for hours in silence, according to former parents and pupils at the Duke of York’s Royal Military School – run by the ex husband of former BBC newscaster Jan Leeming. Another alleged punishment involved pupils having to keep their mouths filled with water while performing a task such as collecting litter. Scroll down for video . Denied accusations: Chris Russell, headmaster at the Duke of York’s Royal Military School in Dover, pictured in 1999 with his then wife Jan Leeming. But when teacher Tracy Austin spoke out about the treatment of pupils, she was arrested by police, along with a parent, accused of the theft of confidential documents. According to Ms Austin, one teacher was sent to a hotel during an Ofsted visit because the school didn’t want inspectors to discover he had not undergone a Criminal Records Bureau check. The Duke of York’s school denies all the allegations. The school, in Dover, prides itself on its military traditions. Its most recent Ofsted report says pupils are happy and well looked after, with school life ‘underpinned by caring and aspirational values’. But some parents claim incidents of bullying and self-harm by pupils have been covered up in an attempt to protect the school’s reputation. The school has Academy status and is partly funded by the Ministry of Defence, with service families paying just over £1,000 a year in boarding fees. Allegations: The Duke of York's Royal Military School in Dover has been accused of creating a 'climate of fear' Ms Austin, who was suspended in May after three years in her £45,000-a-year job, says pupils, parents and teachers have been discouraged from speaking out. The MoS has seen a school log book showing students were punished with something called a ‘custodial’. Ms Austin says this involved them eating, sleeping and studying alone in a cubicle, furnished only with a bed, adjoining the school’s medical centre. Rachael Ward, whose 12-year-old son was punished in this way, said: ‘He was marched to the sanatorium and shoved in this little room. No one was with him. He could have done anything. He could have taken his shoelaces and hung himself and we would be none the wiser. ‘He was stuck there for four hours until we came to collect him.’ Neither Ms Austin nor Georgina Halford-Hall, the parent also accused of handling stolen documents, has been charged. Both are on police bail until September 19. The school’s executive principal Chris Russell was married for four years Ms Leeming. They separated in 2001. For the school, public relations firm Edwards Harvey said: ‘As criminal proceedings are active, the school cannot comment on issues that would affect these cases. ‘Other allegations raised have been examined in detail by Ofsted inspectors, who found no substance in them and marked the school good in every category.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Teacher, Tracy Austin, spoke out about severe punishments at the Duke of York’s Royal Military School in Dover .

"Aston Martin has been forced to recall more than 1,600 of its most expensive sports cars after the discovery of an electronic fault that can lead to a dangerous loss of power. It is the second safety alert affecting the iconic British car-maker this year. In February, nearly 18,000 cars were recalled, including the DBS driven by Daniel Craig in the James Bond movie Quantum Of Solace and a V12 Vantage Roadster that was delivered to his door on his 45th birthday last year. Now Aston Martin has issued a new safety notice – this time affecting the £133,000 DB9 Coupé, as well as the Volante and the four-door £148,000 Rapide S, which has been described by motoring enthusiasts as the world’s most beautiful four-door sports car. Iconic: Daniel Craig as James Bond in his DBS in the Quantum of Solace film. The car is among 18,000 recalled by Aston Martin in February . In February, the firm said a Chinese sub-supplier had been using inferior plastic material in the accelerator pedal arms of models built since late 2007, leading to the weakened substance breaking when the driver increased speed. This time, safety regulators say the problem is caused by a defective Czech-made circuit board in the transmission control that could lead to a crash because the car is left suddenly powerless when it switches itself into neutral gear. More than 1,660 vehicles – 313 of them in Britain – will have to be taken off the road while the fault, which came to light only after an owner complained, is repaired. Paul Hollywood, star of BBC1’s The Great British Bake Off, drives a DB9, the model favoured by many wealthy sports stars and TV celebrities. The British car-maker has issued a new safety notice affecting the £133,000 DB9 Coupé, pictured. It concerns an electronic fault which can lead to a dangerous loss of power . A survey by specialist brokers Oracle Finance last year put the DB9, which has a top speed of 186mph and can go from 0 to 62mph in 4.6 seconds, in the top ten list of cars bought by premiership footballers. Mr Hollywood said when he bought his car last year: ‘I’ve been into cars all my life. Aston Martin employs people here, they’re British, they’re Bond, so when I got my DB9 it was a very special day.’ The latest recall affects cars produced in the 12 months to June this year. An Aston Martin spokesman said: ‘It takes only 30 minutes to change the circuit board and the job is done free of charge. ‘We are working with the supplier to rectify the problem.’","Car-maker has issued a safety notice over DB9 Coupé, Volante and Rapide S .

"It was supposed to be a way of helping hard-pressed families with tired children cope as they stepped off their long holiday flight. But the idea of providing a fleet of 150 complimentary pushchairs at the arrivals hall at Gatwick Airport has backfired – after the majority of them were stolen by passengers. Instead of leaving the buggies at the designated drop-off point in the baggage reclaim area when their own pushchair arrives on the carousel, some holidaymakers have brazenly walked off with them before loading them into their car or boarding the Gatwick Express rail service with their newly acquired booty. Scroll down for video . Free pushchairs have proved so popular at Gatwick airport that parents have been walking off with them. According to border control staff, just three of the original 150 buggies remain . The Mothercare Nanu Strollers were widely welcomed as part of a family-friendly initiative when they were introduced at the airport in West Sussex in April. Airport bosses said at the time that they wanted to encourage families ‘to take advantage’ of the 150 buggies as Gatwick became the UK’s first airport to offer parents the free service. The strollers feature a multi-position reclining seat with adjustable calf rest and normally cost £49.99 on the High Street. The Gatwick buggies bear no stamp or label identifying them as airport property, although their canvas seats are decorated in the same shade of blue as Gatwick’s own-brand logo. According to passport control officials based at the North Terminal, only five of the original fleet of buggies remain. An order for a further 200 has now been placed but airport workers expect many of these to disappear too unless a security device or alarm is fitted to prevent their removal. Gatwick handles up to 60,000 incoming passengers a day and airport managers say it is not surprising that some of the buggies have been misappropriated. The pushchairs have no security tag or alarm fitted to stop people walking away with them, or marking to indicate that they belong to the airport . A spokesman said: ‘I know there is some truth [in the suggestion that scores have been taken] but I don’t have any figures. ‘It’s obviously something we are keeping an eye on. The buggies are just so popular and we are having to continually replenish them.’ The Family and Childcare Trust, which gave Gatwick its Family Friendly UK accreditation after the scheme was launched, said it was ‘disappointed’ by the way some parents had abused the idea but insisted the initiative still had its backing. ‘We’ve had a handful taken since April and the reason for ordering 200 more is due to how popular they have been and to help us manage the flow between the aircraft and baggage halls. ‘They are stored in a branded wall-mounted shelving unit so are very clearly Gatwick property.’","Airport bought 150 buggies for parents to use but only three now remain .

"He is the enfant terrible of British art who made his name and fortune by selling a shark preserved in  formaldehyde and a diamond-encrusted crystal skull. Now Damien Hirst has used his millions to buy one of London’s grandest houses – a stunning example of Regency architecture. The 49-year-old is understood to have completed the purchase last week of the Grade I listed mansion where Diana, Princess of Wales was once a guest at a society party. Scroll down for video .

The stately exterior of Hirst's newest property. He already has an extensive property portfolio but the latest acquisition confirms his position as the world's most financially successful artist . The five-storey property was  put on the market last year for £34 million, although it is thought the Turner Prize-winning artist may have paid considerably more. Commissioned in 1811 by the Prince Regent, it was built by  the renowned architect John Nash and is considered one of the finest of his works. Hirst now plans an extensive renovation of the property, which is adorned by an imposing set of Greek pillars and an elegant frieze at the pinnacle of the main structure. Artist Damien Hirst, 49, has used his millions to buy one of London's grandest houses . Its stately grandeur, as well as its half-acre garden make it one of the most unusual houses ever offered for sale in Central London, according to estate agents. It was owned for nearly 50 years by Anne Van Lanschot, a scion of a Dutch private banking dynasty. She and her businessman husband, Ian Mackeson-Sandbach, bought it soon after they were married. But after his death in 2012, his widow decided the time had come to move on. ‘When we bought it, my only condition was that it had a garden,’ she said recently. ‘We were at a party – the Queen Mother was there too – and noticed a For Sale sign outside the house, and bought it. Crazy, really.’ Princess Diana was a guest on at least one occasion. The area has an illustrious history beyond its impressive royal pedigree. Famous one-time residents include playwright Harold Pinter, poet Sir Edmund Gosse and architect Anthony Salvin, a pupil of Nash. Hirst, who has a £215 million fortune, already has an extensive property portfolio but the latest acquisition confirms his position as the world’s most financially successful artist. His main residence is a 300-year-old farmhouse in Combe Martin, North Devon, set in 24 acres, but he has also owned a house in Thailand and a beach home in Mexico. Until now, one of his most spectacular purchases had been Toddington Manor, a magnificent 19th century Grade I listed 300-room country pile in Gloucestershire. Hirst achieved celebrity status for his controversial art, including a shark preserved in a tank of formaldehyde and a diamond-studded human skull that sold for £50 million. Two years ago The Mail on Sunday revealed the break-up of his 19-year relationship with California-born Maia Norman after she had an affair. They have three children. Last week the London property was unoccupied. An Israeli woman who lives in the road said: ‘It has been on the market for some time and there were rumours that a famous artist had bought it. But we didn’t know it was Damien Hirst.’ Hirst declined to comment. If Hirst runs out of room, there is still room in Toddington Manor, near Cheltenham - the artist's 300-room country pile.

"You might have thought a tiny beach cafe on a sparsely populated Mediterranean island would be no match for the might of a Hollywood blockbuster. But when a rustic restaurant in Gozo posed a problem for the production of a film starring Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, the A-list couple found a diplomatic solution – by renting the place for the summer. The pair and their production crew wanted unfettered access to the pebble beach at the picturesque bay at Mgarr ix-Xini for three months while they make By The Sea. Scroll down for video . Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, attending the premiere of Maleficent at Kensington Palace, London have found a diplomatic solution to a problem in the production of their latest film . The beach is one of the most secluded spots on the island and the cafe holds pride of place at the water’s edge. Owners Noel and Sandra Vella are reportedly being paid thousands of pounds in compensation to shut up shop. Mrs Vella said: ‘I’m not going to make as much had I remained open throughout these months, but at least I’m getting some form of compensation.’ Gozo - which has a population of 31,000 and is a 20-minute ferry ride from the island of Malta, is famous for its rugged landscapes, spectacular coastline and superb diving conditions.

"Adam Walker, pictured, the new leader of the BNP, who is set to visit the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo . The new leader of the BNP has been accused of insulting Britain’s war dead by visiting a shrine that honours Japanese war criminals responsible for the deaths of thousands of Allied troops and civilians during the Second World War. Adam Walker’s visit to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo has outraged veterans’ associations and former soldiers who worked in horrifying conditions as slave labourers on the bridge over the River Kwai. Mr Walker, 45, who took over from Nick Griffin last week as chairman of the far-right British National Party, is himself a former soldier. On its website, the BNP claims to be a ‘patriotic’ party that recognises the ‘huge sacrifice’ of British servicemen and women, yet the Yasukuni Shrine is the most potent symbol of Japan’s militaristic past. Among those it honours are 14 Japanese military commanders and politicians judged by international tribunals to have committed the most heinous war crimes. Last night, veterans expressed horror at his decision to visit there. Robert Hucklesby, 93, spent nearly four years in Japanese prisoner- of-war camps and was forced to work on the River Kwai railway line linking Thailand and Burma. Taken prisoner in Singapore in February 1942 and transported for hundreds of miles in a cattle truck, he weighed only 7st when he emerged from captivity, after surviving on a diet of rice and watery stew. Mr Hucklesby, who was a sapper in the Royal Engineers, said: ‘The guards were brutal and hit us with their rifle butts for the slightest misdemeanour. ‘I am not a vindictive man but I do not have the authority to forgive and forget when so many of my comrades were so badly treated and thousands lie in war graves.’ Another veteran, John Giddings, 91, chairman of the Burma Star Association, who fought the Japanese while serving with the RAF on the Indian- Burmese border, said: ‘Mr Walker should have known better. He should have kept away from Yasukuni. Visiting the shrine is not something any British citizen should do.’ Mr Walker, from Spennymoor, Co Durham, married a Japanese woman, Chie Shinoda, in 2001. He says he speaks the language fluently after living in the country for several years in the 1990s. He visited the controversial shrine in August 2010, on the eve of the 65th anniversary of America’s atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He was there at the invitation of extremist group Nippon Issuikai. The shrine honours war criminals who kept British prisoners of war, like these above in brutal slavery . Father-of-two Mr Walker served as a tank crewman in the King’s Royal Hussars before retraining as a teacher – a profession from which he was banned for life in 2013 after being found guilty of hurling insults at three boys and slashing their bike tyres with a knife. Last year he tried to exploit his military background to win votes by posing for photographs in regimental beret and blazer as the Queen lay a wreath at the Cenotaph. A BNP spokesman said last night: ‘Adam visited the shrine as a mark of respect to the Japanese people as a whole and as a small contribution to reconciliation between our two great countries. ‘He does not condone war crimes, whether past or present. He sees no contradiction, as a former soldier, in honouring innocents and enemies who died in war and his mind and prayers were focused on the vast majority of those commemorated, not the minority of war criminals.’","BNP leader Adam Walker plans to visit the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo .

"'I was in an army but I never fought anyone': Mychajlo Ostapenko, 88, said he could not remember joining the battalion and insisted he did nothing wrong . A great-grandfather living in a quiet Lancashire street has been named as a former soldier in a notorious Nazi SS-led unit responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Jewish and Polish civilians in the Second World War. Retired coal miner Mychajlo Ostapenko, 88, has lived in Britain for more than 65 years – but documents discovered by a Holocaust researcher reveal that he served in the feared 31st Punitive Battalion. The unit carried out appalling atrocities, including the murder of more than 100 prisoners in 1944  and the destruction of the Polish village of Chlaniow, when 44 civilians, including five children, were killed. When contacted by The Mail on Sunday, Mr Ostapenko said he could not remember joining the battalion and insisted he had done nothing wrong. But now his name has been passed by British historian Stephen Ankier to Scotland Yard, which is responsible for investigating war crime suspects. Mr Ostapenko, who was born in Ukraine, was let into Britain in 1947 with no questions asked about his wartime activities and has lived here ever since, marrying an English woman and fathering two daughters. He is thought to be one of the  last veterans of the battalion still alive in Britain, following the death of 89-year-old Serhij Woronyj in a London hospital 15 months ago. Mr Ostapenko lives alone in a council house in a quiet cul-de-sac in Nelson, Lancashire, and is described by neighbours as a friendly man who is often visited by relatives. His wife Sheila died in 1993. Military rosters, payment lists  and other documents found by Dr Ankier in Polish and German archives show Mr Ostapenko had the rank of rifleman in the unit and that in 1945 he was captured by British forces and transferred to a PoW camp at Rimini in Italy. He was granted British citizenship in 1956 and his certificate of naturalisation said he was a miner from Accrington. The 31st Punitive Battalion, also known as the Ukrainian Self-Defence League, comprised volunteers led by SS officers and was involved in brutal operations such as the suppression of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. There is no evidence Mr Ostapenko took part in any war crimes, but campaigners say he may have been a witness. Massacre: The 1944 Warsaw Uprising that the 31st battalion played a role in suppressing . Former Labour MP Andrew Dismore said: ‘Even if people like Ostapenko were not directly involved in war crimes, they may have a great deal of first-hand knowledge. 'If they have a clear conscience, there is no reason why they should not co-operate [with police].’ Last week Mr Ostapenko, who speaks ungrammatical English with a strong Ukrainian accent, confirmed he was in Poland during the war but said he never harmed civilians. ‘I don’t know nothing about what was going on. I was in hospital in Poland for about nine months with appendicitis. Then I was at home. I was in an army but I never fought anyone. I haven’t done anything wrong. I haven’t killed anybody. I was in the Rimini camp. The British looked after us well. I can’t remember anything else. I’m sorry.’ Dr Ankier said: ‘These people ought to be held accountable for what they have done, even if it happened many years ago.’","Documents suggest Mychajlo Ostapenko was in 31st Punitive Battalion .

"A huge payday loan company whose shameful tactics were exposed by a Mail on Sunday investigation has been forced out of the market by regulators. The Cheque Centre has been ordered by the Financial Conduct Authority to stop offering short-term loans that have to be repaid in a lump sum. In March an MoS reporter worked in one of the company’s 496 branches, where he secretly filmed staff preying on vulnerable customers and locking them into spiralling debt with loans at interest rates of up to 3,000 per cent. Staff at Cheque Centre were found preying on vulnerable people and locking them into high interest loans . Predatory salesmen cold-called previous borrowers and one manager boasted that he often signed up customers who smelled strongly of alcohol. FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley warned that other operators should take note. ‘This is an early victory for people that use payday lenders. I have said before that firms would need to dramatically improve their operation or exit the market, and we are now seeing that happening.’ The Cheque Centre, which  had a turnover last year of £374 million, will be banned until it can prove that it treats its customers fairly and in accordance with regulations.

"Probe: Slough's Labour leader Robert Anderson . A council leader is being investigated by police for allegedly snatching a rival party’s leaflet from a letterbox during last week’s council elections. Robert Anderson, leader of Slough Council in Berkshire, is alleged to have put his hand through the front-door flap, removed a Ukip leaflet and replaced it with his own Labour flyer. Mr Anderson, who sits on the board of the Government’s Audit Commission spending watchdog, insists it’s  an unfortunate misunderstanding. But Ukip complained to Thames Valley Police, leading to a probe. The householder at the centre of the row, Ian Church, 36, said he saw a hand come through his letterbox. ‘The blue leaflet was taken out and then a red one pushed through. 'I thought, “Hang on, that’s theft,” so I put on my shoes and went outside and saw Rob Anderson posting leaflets through the house next door. 'I knew it was him as he’s well known in Slough and I’d seen him about. ‘I said, “I’ve just watched you take something out of my letterbox.” Complaint: The leaflet at the centre of the row. Ukip were beaten in the Britwell ward by 1,189 votes . 'He said, “Do you want it back?” I said yes and he went over to a colleague and came back with the leaflet. He gave it to me and apologised.’ Mr Anderson, who has led the council since 2008, secured 1,189 votes to beat his Ukip rivals in the Britwell ward. But the anti-EU party lodged a complaint with the police after other residents said leaflets had disappeared from their homes. Two officers went to Mr Church’s home to take a statement and the force’s investigation is ‘ongoing’. Mr Anderson, 50, said: ‘I did  not take Mr Church’s or anyone else’s leaflet.’","Robert Anderson was the subject of a complaint by the anti-EU party .

"A renowned conductor, his musician wife and their children have been evicted from their home after a dispute with a builder led to financial ruin. Peter and Kathryn Bassano have been declared bankrupt and were forced this week to leave their six-bedroom house in the Chilterns where they had lived for 16 years. In an exclusive interview, Mr Bassano revealed that his wife – who played the viola on the Harry Potter and Lord Of The Rings film soundtracks – had to face the bailiffs alone after he was rushed to hospital with high blood pressure caused by stress. Peter and Kathryn Bassano have lost their family home after a dispute with a builder led to financial ruin . ‘The bailiffs have changed the locks to stop us returning,’ he said. ‘We are homeless and relying on the kindness of friends.’ Their home was seized on the instructions of Northern Rock and a bridging loan company, which say the couple owe them £636,000. Mr Bassano disputes that figure. But documents seen by this newspaper show that the Bassanos’ total debts amount to more than £3 million, owed to mortgage companies, law firms and the local council. Mr Bassano, 68, said his troubles began when he had to borrow heavily after becoming embroiled in a legal battle with a local builder over the cost of an extension to the house in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire. The couple lived in this six-bedroom home in the Chilterns for 16 years with their children. Northern Rock say the couple owe them £636,000 and their total debts are thought to amount to £3million . The former Royal College of Music . professor claims he is now unable to sell the property – once valued at . £3 million – because it has been blighted by the HS2 high-speed rail . link. In a further setback, Mrs Bassano, 56, has been unable to work as she  was forced to sell her viola earlier this year, after losing a court battle over loan repayments on the 200-year-old instrument. Mr Bassano said: ‘The extension was intended to increase the value of the house but once  we got involved in litigation, it  was difficult to withdraw without incurring further costs. ‘I don’t blame anyone else for  our . financial predicament. But we were hit by a perfect storm of the banking . crisis, my earnings dropping and a huge fall in the value  of the . house.’ Kathryn Bassano played the viola on both the Harry Potter (pictured) and Lord Of The Rings film soundtracks . Their four children – aged between 12 and 22 – have been educated at Eton and Cheltenham Ladies’ College. But Mr Bassano denied the family led an extravagant lifestyle and said the school fees were funded by bursaries and scholarships. Their debts began to accumulate during the dispute over the extension in 2002, said Mr Bassano, who has been a guest conductor with leading orchestras.","Peter and Kathryn Bassano bankrupt following dispute with builder .

"Human keep-fit enthusiasts have long had any number of gadgets for measuring their exertions in the parks and pools. Now there’s a device that lets them get the same information about their canine friends. The gadget and accompanying mobile phone app mean dog-owners can monitor how much exercise their pet is taking, even when they are far away at work or on holiday. Tracker: The watch-sized device is attached to a dog's collar (pictured) and keeps track of their activity . A small circular device, about the size of a watch face, attached to the dog’s collar gathers the data. Information from the Whistle Activity Monitor can then be downloaded on to a mobile phone or a computer to reveal whether the  animal has spent the afternoon  lazing in its basket or burning off energy in the garden. The data is then beamed to a smartphone and appears as a graph showing how much exercise your pet got and at what times . Exercise goals can be set each day and the dog’s performance compared with other animals of a similar age and breed. Every action – from a stroll around the house to a high-speed chase after the neighbour’s cat – is recorded on the phone as a graph. This displays how much and how quickly the dog has moved around. The heart of the device is a three-axis accelerometer, whose readings are translated into the graph by specially designed algorithms. It also tracks the dog’s exact location using wireless technology and comes with a USB charger for topping up the battery every five days or so. The American manufacturers say the device gives owners a new perspective on a dog’s day-to-day behaviour and allows them to track long-term health trends. Chief executive Ben Jacobs, who has been a dog-owner all his life, said it was capable of detecting veterinary problems that might otherwise be missed. He said: ‘Dogs are very good at hiding the signs [of deteriorating health] from owners. If you can see a change in activity, it makes it possible to spot problems sooner and get them treated with less expensive and more preventative measures.’ Appropriately for the current British climate, Whistle is completely waterproofed – so the gadget won’t short out even if walkies are in the torrential rain. It is on sale online for around £80.","The £80 Whistle Activity Monitor attaches to a dog's collar .

"A woman who was the target of an underworld murder plot is suing the police officers who saved her life, accusing them of breaching her human rights. The 47-year-old mother has lodged a High Court writ claiming she is penniless after spending almost a decade in a witness protection scheme. She is seeking £100,000 damages from the Metropolitan Police. The professional make-up artist and her teenage daughter have been living at a succession of secret addresses in southern England since she and her former partner – a drug dealer with links to the notorious Adams family – were threatened by crime barons. 'Abandoned': Julie, whose name and face are deliberately not being revealed says she's lost everything due to the Metropolitan police. She was put in witness protection almost a decade ago . She says the police prevented her from working during her time in  hiding and that her home in London and other properties were repossessed because she had to abandon them. Julie (not her real name) said: ‘I have lost everything. I feel totally abandoned by the police. ‘I was promised that the Met would reimburse any losses I suffered as a result of going into their witness protection programme. Instead I have been left with no money and am still scared of every knock at the door.’ She has issued a High Court writ  in which she claims that the force’s ‘dishonest’ treatment of her breached her human rights. Last week the Adams family crime syndicate was targeted in a series of raids by more than 200 police officers on 22 homes in North London. Some 15 people were arrested and thousands of pounds’ worth of property confiscated. Julie’s ordeal is alleged to have begun when police seized a large consignment of cannabis from a van being driven by her then boyfriend. Last week, the Adams family crime syndicate was targeted in a series of raids by 200 police officers on 22 homes in north London - one raid pictured . He is said to have deliberately . crashed the vehicle to get arrested rather than face the wrath of . criminals who believed he had double-crossed them. Police . telephoned Julie with a warning that a hitman had been hired to kill . her for disobeying a gangland order to sell her family’s property . portfolio so that her boyfriend’s ‘debt’ to the drug overlords could be . repaid. She was met at the end of her street by two detectives who named the would-be killer as Mark Dorling. The police told Julie they had uncovered a plot to murder her at her daughter’s school fete later that day. She . said: ‘I was just numb. I couldn’t believe anyone would plan a killing . at a nice posh school where soap stars sent their kids. ‘But . the officers insisted my life was in real danger and I needed to go . into witness protection with my family straight away. To be told the . Adams family were after me was terrifying.’ Dorling would later be jailed for 25 years for stabbing to death a former prison officer. Julie claims she was told she might have to spend six months under police protection until the opening of Dorling’s murder trial, at which she gave evidence for the prosecution. She said: ‘Those six months turned into years. My mother, daughter and  I were moved to nine homes between 2003 and 2011 for our own safety. We were virtually living on the run, scared of every knock at the door. ‘My houses were repossessed. I couldn’t maintain them or afford to keep them going.’ Her case is due to be heard later this year. She says she cannot afford a solicitor and will represent herself. ‘I did the right thing by giving evidence but I have been very badly let down by the police. I trusted them but they have not kept their promise to compensate me for helping them put away a very dangerous man. ‘Life under witness protection has been awful and left me penniless.’ A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘We have received a claim and are considering it.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Mother, 47, claims she is penniless after a decade in witness protection .

"An American couple were violently ill throughout a 20-hour flight home after they caught a vomiting bug at one of Heston Blumenthal restaurants. David Jones, 39, and his wife Melissa, 38, spent £277.66 on the meal at Dinner, the two Michelin-starred venue in Hyde Park, London, where they ate delicacies such as calf tail and powdered duck breast to mark the end of their holiday. But 48 hours later, as they flew back to Denver, the couple were struck down by norovirus. Difficult journey: David Jones and his wife Melissa contracted norovirus after eating at Heston Blumenthal's London restaurant causing problems for them during their 20-hour flight to America . Ashley Palmer Watts Executive Head Chef of the Fat Duck Group and head Chef at Dinner with Heston Blumenthal in the kitchen, which has now been shut down thanks to the winter vomiting bug . Blumenthal closed the restaurant on . Saturday, after tests confirmed an outbreak of the bug. Norovirus forced . a similar closure of Blumenthal's other restaurant, The Fat Duck in . Bray, five years ago. Mr Jones, an IT Consultant told the Evening Standard he was violently ill 'on a reasonably frequent basis' during the flight to Denver. He . said: 'It was not good. At one point I had a chill, but no fever and my . wife said I looked extremely pale. It was not a lot of fun.' He . added: 'We were quite excited about going there. I had a group of . friends who had been there the week before and raved about it and that . added to my excitement. 'It's . never a good thing to go through that experience, especially at a . restaurant like that. I'll definitely be back to the UK, but maybe not . to Heston's."" Blumenthal, . known as the 'culinary alchemist', apologised to customers at the . Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park Hotel when he closed the restaurant on . Saturday, after 24 diners and 21 members of staff were taken ill. The chef said: 'My goal has always been to pursue perfection in . the kitchen and to amaze our guests with taste sensations beyond their . imagination, rather than expose them to the risk of a really nasty . couple of days of heaving.' He added: 'I personally have the experience and knowledge about this winter bug and how to contain it immediately.

The restaurant is the second of Blumenthal's to be shut down due to the outbreak of a virus, the first being his establishment 'Fat Duck' 'I . am very sorry for the inconvenience to those customers affected by the . cancellations. However, I will reopen the restaurant safe in the . knowledge that we have done everything we can do to continue to strive . to create the perfect environment and food for my guests to enjoy. I . will always err on the side of extreme caution.' The restaurant is expected to remain closed this week. Hailed . by food critics as ‘astonishing’ and ‘seriously good’, Dinner has been . rated by experts as one of the world’s finest restaurants. Mr . Blumenthal, who was criticised for reacting too slowly when his . flagship restaurant The Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, was hit by a worse . outbreak, said the temporary closure of Dinner might seem ‘rather . extreme and over cautious’. The chef, famous . for his experimental cooking, said the problem came to light two weeks . ago when a guest reported feeling unwell with symptoms consistent with . the norovirus winter vomiting bug. The restaurant, in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Knightsbridge, immediately called in Westminster Council environmental health officers and nine further reports of illness were recorded. Mr Blumenthal, whose restaurant caters for about 1,000 people a week and where a meal for two can cost £190, said the complaints peaked after a couple of days and tests made by Westminster officials came back negative. According to a food website, Westminster . food safety officers have confirmed there had been an outbreak of the . bug and were quoted as saying: ‘We have asked the restaurant to improve . some of its hygiene procedures – including telling staff to wash their . hands more often. The changes were made immediately.’ The location of Heston Blumenthal's restaurant Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. Blumenthal closed the restaurant himself when he heard about the outbreak of the virus that had made it's way into the kitchen . Blumenthal has been notorious for his strange and eclectic dishes, and his recent dining endeavour is no exception, with a menu featuring ancient recipes . In one of the largest known outbreak of the bug in a restaurant, more than 240 people were affected by norovirus at The Fat Duck. The restaurant, which has three Michelin stars and was voted the best restaurant in the world in 2005, was accused of waiting six weeks after the first suspected case before reporting it to the Health Protection Agency, though managers rejected any suggestion of wrongdoing. A spokesman for The Fat Duck said at the time that the outbreak had been caused by ‘oysters contaminated at source by norovirus.’ The establishment reopened after a ten-day investigation. Norovirus is the most common stomach bug in the UK. It is highly contagious and causes vomiting and diarrhoea. If an infected person does not wash their hands before handling food, they can pass the virus on. It can also be spread from contaminated surfaces and equipment.","David Jones, 39, and his wife Melissa, 38, spent £277.66 on the meal .

"The RSPCA has been criticised for shooting dead a sick foal then leaving it in sight of a children’s play area for several days with a note demanding that the owner remove the body. A second foal was left alone with the body and was in a state of ‘distress’ until it was rescued. After the foal was put down, the RSPCA inspectors left a letter headed ‘Removal of animals left unattended’ because they could not establish who the owner was. The RSPCA allegedly shot a foal and left its bloodied body in sight of a children's play area. File image . The foals are thought to have been dumped on the rough grazing land at Severn Beach, near Bristol, in an example of ‘fly grazing’. This entails abandoning unwanted animals on private land, thus making the landowner responsible for  their welfare. Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick, of the Associate Parliamentary Group for  Animal Welfare, last night questioned  how the charity could have thought it acceptable to abandon the dead foal and  its companion. ‘It all sounds deeply unsettling,’  Mr Fitzpatrick said. ‘It certainly doesn’t sound like good practice. Jim Fitzpatrick described the incident as 'deeply unsettling' ‘The RSPCA should have done more to trace the landowner and get an appropriate responsible person to take care of the removal of the body.’ The shooting of the bay gelding on January 8 dismayed residents, who complained to the RSPCA and the local council. Resident Becky Ashdown said: ‘It was so sad to see that dead foal in the field,  just lying out in the open with blood all around its head. ‘The other one was left in the field with the carcass, and I think that  it was quite distressed. ‘The two horses were without water or food for weeks, and all they got was  from passers-by who felt sorry for them.’ Katie Merrett, of nearby Stroud, said:  ‘I have been in touch with the RSPCA and, as far as I can gather, they decided the foal had to be put down. They said it was the kindest thing to do. ‘It was very distressing for local children, leaving the body where they could see it from their play area.’ Last night the RSPCA defended its actions, saying the horse, which was unable to stand, had been put down on veterinary advice as a matter of animal welfare. A spokesman said that both it and the surviving foal had now been removed, and that the cost had been met by the owner, whom the charity had managed to trace.","RSPCA shot sick foal and left its body in field for owner to recover .

"Winning team: Olympic hero Sir Bradley Wiggins and his wife, Catherine, who, he claims, brokered many of the deals MTC management is claiming commission for . Cycling champion Sir Bradley Wiggins is embroiled in a complex legal tussle over his earnings from his £5 million Tour de France triumph and sponsorship deals. The 2012 Olympic gold medallist, who became the first Briton to win the Tour, is being sued in the High Court by his former management team at the MTC agency. The dispute began when MTC, which represents sporting stars including Sally Gunnell, Jonathan Edwards, Colin Jackson and Steve Backley, billed him for commission of £741,000 on his contract with Team Sky. Sir Bradley, who was knighted in the 2013 New Year’s Honours List, refused to pay, according to the writ. He then terminated his arrangement with MTC and issued a counter-claim. In it, he accused the agency of trying to charge fees it was not entitled to on his personal income from cycling, and claimed the firm’s accounting system was disorganised. MTC claims it agreed to act as his sole agent in exchange for 20 per cent of his gross income from TV appearances and sponsorship deals. But Sir Bradley says that the company was entitled to commission only on contracts it negotiated for him, and that for his first four years with the firm, some deals were arranged by his wife Catherine and friends. After his success at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where he won two gold medals, Sir Bradley asked MTC managing director Jonathan Marks to act for him  in connection with his move to Team Sky, it is claimed. Three years later, he is said to have asked Mr Marks to renegotiate his contract with the team. Sky principal and British cycling supremo Sir Dave Brailsford allegedly told Mr Marks in a phone call that Sir Bradley had been offered up to £4 million a year, plus a £1 million bonus, if he won the 2012 Tour de France. As a result, MTC is said to have invoiced Sir Bradley for nearly £750,000 to reflect his enhanced earning power. MTC accuses him of breaching his obligations under their agreement. Sir Bradley – nicknamed ‘Wiggo’ by his fans – denies this. Claims: MTC claims it was behind Sir Bradley's landmark deal with Sky ahead of his £5m Tour de France win . The cyclist, who lives with Catherine and their children Ben and Isabella in a farmhouse in Eccleston, Lancashire, is now represented by XIX Entertainment, the celebrity agency owned by Pop Idol creator Simon Fuller. Sir Bradley, 33, is Britain’s most decorated Olympian, having won seven medals during his career – one more than rower Sir Steve Redgrave. He started competitive cycling at the age of 12, when a crash  in South London’s Herne Hill velodrome put him on the road  to greatness. The accident led to a £1,000 compensation payout which enabled him to buy his first racing bike. Success: The cyclist, Britain's most decorated Olympian, is now represented by Simon Fuller's celebrity agency XIX Entertainment . In his 2009 autobiography, he tells of a spiral into doubt and depression after the 2004 Olympics, when his low income and lack of recognition left his family struggling for money. In January last year, Sir Bradley’s legal team wrote to MTC, suspending its authority  to act for him and his charitable foundation. The agency says this amounted to a repudiation of their agreement and entitled them to sue  for damages. A spokesman for XIX Entertainment said last night: ‘Sir Bradley is no longer represented by MTC. He strenuously denies that it was he who breached the terms of any contract and as  this is subject to legal proceeding he will not be commenting further.’ MTC declined to comment.","Gold medallist issued commission bill from MTC management for £741,000 .

"Two gardeners have described the heart-stopping moment they discovered a corpse at the bottom of a well in a Surrey village. Rory Mulholland, 21, from New Addington, Surrey, and his 17 year old colleague Jack Duncan found the body as they worked at a house in Warlingham, Surrey, on Friday. Mr Mulholland said: 'I thought ""It can't be a body, then we saw skin with hair on it. 'I was shaking. I said ""what should we do?""' Scroll down for video . Probe: Police have launched a murder investigation after the body of a man was found down a well in Surrey . Grim task: Officers from the Underwater and Confined Space Search Team during the recovery operation . He told the Croydon Advertiser: 'It was definitely a man. You could tell by the size of his thighs, he had builder’s legs. 'I was shocked because I had been working right next to it. I’d even sat on the well to have a cigarette with the body beneath me.' Mr Duncan added: 'I didn't really know it was a body to start with. I was poking it, turning it over in the water,' reports The Sunday Mirror: . Cleaned: A police specialist diver being washed down after leaving the scene . Seven Polish men, aged between 21 and 27, have been bailed until a date in late December, pending further investigation. The . gardeners found the body of a white adult as they cleared the front . garden of the large property, which stands in an acre of grounds. The body was partially submerged in water in the 11ft well. A local resident, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It is really shocking. You do not expect it here. It is a really quiet, well-to-do area.’ A neighbour, who only gave his name as Ben, said: 'I actually looked down that well two months ago. 'There was lots of rubbish. It's so weird to think I've looked down there and now there's a body down there. It's so bizarre. 'I was on my way back from work and my girlfriend said there's a body been found in the well outside the Polish house. I couldn't believe it. 'I see them in the local shop all the time, they're friendly.' Grandmother-of-four Val Sloane, 67, who lives in Audley Drive with her husband Graham, 64, said: 'It's unbelievable, in such a quiet road, it's quite frightening really. 'Yesterday (Friday) I got home about 2.30pm and heard lots of car doors slamming and looked out of the window and there was the police. 'Then more and more people arrived and I knew it was serious because they cordoned it off. 'It's a nice road, this kind of thing can happen anywhere. I hope it's over and dealt with soon and they catch those responsible.' Police divers removed the body yesterday and a post-mortem examination is due to be carried out at East Surrey Hospital mortuary this afternoon. Aerial view of the scene: The well was 2ft wide, 7ft deep and the water was approximately 4ft deep . Tents: The body was found in the narrow shaft of a well outside this house on Audley Drive in Warlingham . Gardeners working at the house, set within an acre of land, spotted the body in the well in Surrey . Detective Chief Inspector Cliff Lyons, . of the Metropolitan Police’s Homicide and Serious Crime Command, said . the arrested men were aged between 21 and 27. ‘This is a . murder investigation,’ he said. ‘As far as I am concerned, when a body . is found in a well it either fell in there or was placed in there. The . evidence suggests that the body was placed in there.’ He said the body presented a number of logistical challenges, requiring a police marine diving team with breathing apparatus to recover it intact to preserve forensic evidence. 'The well is two feet in diameter, it is seven feet deep to the water line, and the water is approximately four feet deep,' he said. Specialist divers, pictured, were called to the scene and were assessing how to remove the body without destroying any evidence . He said it was not possible to be sure . of the body's gender, but judging by the size it was most likely to be . an adult. The person was white but he could not confirm the gender. Mr Lyons told reporters at the scene: . 'It's not been there for an extended period of time; it will be a matter . of weeks at the most.' He was not prepared to discuss who lived in the house, or a suggestion that the body was wrapped in carpet. He could not confirm whether the body was intact. Asked about claims by local residents that there had been quite a bit of trouble in the past couple of years with the people who lived in the house, and that police had been called many times, he said: 'The residents have expressed concern, there is intelligence to support that notion, yes.' Evidence found by the divers at the scene indicated that the body had been placed in the well, police said . The gardeners were tidying up at the . property, which is set in an acre of land on a road of semi-detached . properties, when they spotted the body. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Specialist officers, including Metropolitan Police divers, attended the scene and the process of recovering the body from the well has been completed.'

"Plans: Judge Keith Cutler led the inquest into the death of Mark Duggan . The coroner in the controversial Mark Duggan inquest has said he will ask the dead man’s family to help shape recommendations on police firearms procedure. Senior circuit judge Keith Cutler told The Mail on Sunday he will take ‘the unusual, perhaps unique step’ of inviting submissions from the Duggan family. Among the issues he will seek views on will be ‘training of officers and preparation for operations’. It is the first time the judge, who was criticised in some quarters over his handling of the inquest, has spoken publicly about the case. ‘Whatever you think of him as an individual, Mark Duggan was somebody’s son,’ said the judge at his home in Wiltshire yesterday. ‘No one wanted him to die.’ Last week the inquest jury decided that 29-year-old Duggan – shot dead in a police ambush in Tottenham, north London in August 2011 – was lawfully killed. His death sparked riots across the country. Jurors were given special protection by police as they left the Royal Courts of Justice, following the intimidation and abuse they faced from Duggan’s supporters during the hearing. A senior Met commander said the scenes in court were totally unacceptable, while a leading crime prevention expert said they threatened to damage the ‘dignity’ of Britain’s most prestigious court. Judge Cutler pointedly declined to respond to the criticism yesterday, but defended his decision to hold a 20-second silence for Duggan when the inquest began last September. ‘It was my idea. I know it was controversial, and I know the police were bristling about it and sections of the media were very critical, but I believe that Mark Duggan’s death led to a great deal of unrest. I thought that a few moments’ reflection at the start of the inquest might be quite healing. ‘I used the words “regrettable death” at the time and there is no doubt that’s what it was. The police have said right from the start that his death was regrettable. ‘It’s interesting to see that now the inquest is over the police have taken up my phrase and are using the words “regrettable death” as they try to reach out to Mark’s family. That can only be a good thing.’ Scroll down for video . Defiant gesture: Carole Duggan raised her fist in front of crowds who gathered outside the High Court following the inquest verdict last week . Near anarchy: Members of the crowd pointed and shouted at Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley as he read a statement outside the court . He added that he is about to begin formulating a series of recommendations on firearms procedure for the Home Secretary, following issues raised by the inquest. ‘In that sense the inquest is not quite complete,’ he said. ‘I will go quiet for a while but around the middle of February I will be announcing what recommendations I have made to the Secretary of State. Shot dead: Former gangster Mark Duggan was killed by police in 2011 . ‘Normally I would hide away and come to my own conclusions about these recommendations but this has been a highly charged and high- profile case. I have wanted to have transparency for all the parties and the public. ‘In that spirit I am taking the unusual, perhaps unique, step of  inviting submissions from all the interested parties including the Duggan family. I’ll wait to receive all the views before sitting down and carefully considering any  recommendations that need to be made. ‘The obvious one, that officers wear head cameras on these types of operations, has already been put forward. But there will be other issues including the training of officers and preparation for operations. ‘I have told all the parties that I want to proceed in this way and the police have indicated they would like to hear what others have to say first before putting forward their own suggestions. That’s fair enough. I have no objection to that.’ Judge Cutler received advice during the inquest from the PR firm Champollion, fuelling speculation that they may have played a role in the decision to open the hearing with a silence. Evidence given to the inquest revealed that Duggan had been linked to ten shootings and two murders. In the eight years before his death he was repeatedly arrested over a succession of serious crimes, including murder, attempted murder and firearms offences. Before his death, Duggan was followed by surveillance officers after picking up a gun from fellow underworld figure Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, jailed at the Old Bailey for 11 years last February. Police believe he planned to use the pistol to avenge the murder of his cousin Kelvin Easton, who was stabbed to death with a bottle in a nightclub five months earlier.

"'Without real principle': Greg Dyke attacked Tony Blair in an interview . Tony Blair has been branded ‘a shady figure’ and a ‘very sad man’ by former BBC director-general Greg Dyke. He also said the former Prime Minister had betrayed the founding principles of the Labour Party. It is the strongest criticism that Mr Dyke has levelled at Mr Blair since the row over the intelligence dossier on Saddam Hussein’s alleged ‘weapons of mass destruction’, which a BBC reporter claimed was ‘sexed up’ by No10 to strengthen the case for the invasion of Iraq. The resultant inquiry led to  Mr Dyke’s resignation. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Dyke also expressed contempt for Mr Blair’s business ventures, which have earned him a multi-million-pound fortune since he left Downing Street in 2007. Recalling an attempt by Mr Blair to ‘patch up’ their quarrel, Mr Dyke – now chairman of the Football Association – said: ‘He invited me for tea. I didn’t go. My relationship with him, which wasn’t worth anything, was completely broken. ‘I think Blair now is a very sad man, rich, but [he] betrayed everything the Labour Party was about. 'He’s a bit of a shady figure. If you go around a bunch of suspect Middle Eastern governments, taking vast sums for advising them – I laugh when everyone talks about senior pay, saying that no one must earn more than the Prime Minister. ‘I keep saying, “Hang on, is this what the Prime Minister earns in office or what the Prime Minister earns over the next 20 years?’ In his 2004 autobiography, Inside Story, Mr Dyke, 66, condemned the former PM as ‘a man without real principle’. His latest remarks reveal the resentment he still feels over his enforced departure from the BBC. Both he and the chairman, Gavyn Davies, stepped down after the Hutton Inquiry into the death of Government scientist Dr David Kelly and a furious attack on the BBC’s senior management by Mr Blair’s official spokesman, Alastair Campbell. Mr Dyke received a £456,000 payoff from the BBC, including  a bonus of £81,000. Attack: Mr Dyke, now chairman of the Football Association, stood down as BBC director-general after a government inquiry . He gave everything except the bonus to York University, where he had studied. Commenting on the current row over huge redundancy payments to BBC executives, he told the FT: ‘The problem at the BBC is that senior salaries went too high. Therefore, pay-offs became very high.’ The main reason he had given away nearly all his payoff  was that he didn’t want to have to answer questions about whether his BBC salary had been too large, he said. Asked how he coped with  losing the BBC job, he said: ‘I remember being p****d off for close on a couple of years. ‘I remember my daughter saying to me one day, “Why don’t you just get over it?” And I thought, “Yeah, that’s right.” ’","The former director-general attacked Mr Blair's lucrative business ventures .

"The BBC is investigating allegations that one of its presenters was involved in a ‘vicious and unrelenting cyber-bullying campaign’ that contributed to the death of a 47-year-old man. Murray Norton, who has been a BBC broadcaster for nearly 30 years, strongly denies making offensive comments on social networking sites about Simon Abbott, a computer software developer who died of a heart attack earlier this year. Mr Norton is said to have posted messages on Facebook and Twitter suggesting Mr Abbott was a conman, siphoning off charity donations for his own use. Reputation: Simon Abbott, left, appearing on TV to raise awareness of his charity and BBC Radio Jersey presenter Murray Norton . The alleged abuse encouraged dozens . of ‘internet trolls’ to join in the harassment, some allegedly claiming . they were taking their cue from Mr Norton because of his status as a BBC . broadcaster. Police have said they were not aware of any evidence Mr Abbott was misappropriating funds.His father believes the alleged bullying hastened his son’s death. And . last night The Mail on Sunday discovered that the extent to which . stress may have contributed to Mr Abbott’s heart attack will be . considered at the forthcoming inquest. In . his spare time Mr Abbott ran a charitable foundation he set up in . memory of his sister Samantha, who committed suicide in 2009 while . suffering from post-natal depression. Before . his death in June, he had begun libel proceedings against  Mr Norton . and other people whose false allegations, he claimed, had destroyed his . reputation and turned him into a recluse, unable to work and frightened . to leave his house.  A defence was lodged denying all  the claims. However, . his father, Jon Abbott, believes the alleged comments were posted by Mr . Norton and others and is demanding to know why BBC bosses apparently . made no attempt to stop Mr Norton spreading unfounded rumours about his . son. The . retired journalist, who lives in South Africa, said: ‘Simon’s schemes . failed to raise any money, partly due to his own shortcomings as a . charity organiser and partly because it was an impossible task to make a . success of any project that kept being slated on the internet. ‘The . takings (for the trust) appear to have been pitiful. When he died, . there was little money in his  bank account and the trust was £1,400 in . the red. That doesn’t make him a conman. Deplorable: Jon Abbott, pictured with Simon, right, in the mid 1970s believes the alleged bullying hastened his son's death . ‘It is deplorable for the BBC to stand on the sidelines. Norton was working for a national institution funded by the British taxpayer and was very much in the public eye.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘We offer our sincere condolences to Mr Abbott but strongly assert the BBC has treated the complaints in question seriously. No evidence of cyber-bullying was found and the complaint was not upheld.’ One of the online messages, purportedly written by the radio host, allegedly said: ‘Simon, if you are reading this – which, my friends, he might be – give it up, come clean on the finances of the trust, put the items you claim to have from the famous to good use.I’ll auction them for some people in real need instead of false events that help no one.’ One of Mr Abbott’s tormentors, a woman from Cornwall, was questioned by police after he complained about her behaviour in November 2011. She was ‘given advice’ by officers but not charged with any offence. But when Mr Abbott’s father wrote to the BBC after his son’s death, the managing editor of BBC Radio Jersey, Jon Gripton, said that since  Mr Norton was a ‘freelance artist’, the corporation had no responsibility for his off-air activities. Mr Norton’s links with the BBC, however, are long-established and he hosts a three-hour show on Radio Jersey every weekday morning. Simon Abbott said in a court statement relating to his libel action: ‘People think I am a conman, dishonest, and even that I have made up the death of my sister. Because he (Norton) works for the BBC everyone follows he (sic) and joins in.’ Jon Abbott’s complaint against Mr Norton is now being re-examined by one of the BBC’s most senior executives, David Holdsworth. Mr Norton combines his broadcasting career with running two restaurants in Jersey. Our calls to him went unanswered.

"Debts: Society dress designer Tabitha Webb is facing claims from suppliers that she owes thousands of pounds in unpaid bills for goods and services . A society dress designer favoured by the Duchess of Cambridge and her sister Pippa Middleton is facing claims from suppliers that she owes thousands of pounds in unpaid bills for goods and services. Among the claimants is a courier firm that accuses Tabitha Webb of owing more than £17,000 in bills  dating back to 2007. Documents seen by The Mail on Sunday also reveal that the collapse of one of the companies she set up to operate her fashion business has left her with outstanding debts of more than £250,000 – and that none of those companies is a going concern. The news will come as a shock to Kate and Pippa, as well as to such other high-profile clients as TV presenter and model Kelly Brook. Ms Webb came to worldwide  attention last year when the Duchess of Cambridge wore one of her creations – a simple floral summer dress – on a visit to Australia with Prince William. She attracted further attention when Pippa Middleton wore a Webb-designed dress  at the wedding of James Meade and Lady Laura Marsham in Norfolk earlier this month. Her foundering company, Ragdoll Management, was behind a fashion range Ms Webb launched three years ago with her best friend, the singer and former X Factor judge Dannii Minogue. The collection, named Project D, focused on easy-to-wear dresses that were on sale at Selfridges and Harvey Nichols. At its launch, Ms Minogue said: ‘What I really want to get across is that this is not a celebrity brand. High-profile: Pippa Middleton, left, and model Kelly Brook, right, in dresses designed by Ms Webb . People might say, “Oh what the  hell is she doing?” And you know what, I agree with them. What the hell am I doing? This is the biggest putting-your-a***-on-the-line thing  I could ever do.’ But in July, Ms Minogue announced that she was ending her involvement in the brand. Now it has emerged that Ragdoll Management is about to be struck off the Companies House register and is five months late in filing  its accounts. Another of Ms Webb’s companies, Dollybird Ltd, is dormant and has only £100 in the bank, according to its latest accounts. The first company she founded, Tabitha Webb Ltd, went into liquidation in May 2007, owing more than £214,000 to business creditors and a further £60,000 to the taxman. Partner: Dannii Minogue poses at the launch of Project D London for Ernest Jones at Westfield London. In July, she announced that she was ending her involvement in the brand . Courier firm CSM Logistics, which was used to ferry clothes and handbags between venues, says it was left £8,600 out of pocket by Tabitha Webb Ltd and that another transport firm in the CSM group, Sandrair, is owed £8,700. A CSM spokesman said: ‘We have sent registered letters to all her addresses but there has been no response. We have told her that if she doesn’t pay what she owes us, we are entitled to sell her stock.’ Ms Webb, 38, lives in a £1 million house in Wandsworth, South London, with her South African-born husband, business consultant Gavin Ferrar, and their daughter Betsey Belle. In an interview with The Mail on Sunday’s You magazine three weeks ago, she said the family have a six-week holiday in South Africa every Christmas and own a cottage in Cornwall. Ms Webb’s solicitors, London firm Lee & Thompson, said: ‘Tabitha Somerset Webb has had a long career in fashion design and over this time has set up a number of different companies. ‘Tabitha is currently producing made-to-measure dresses and is  in the process of launching a new range, under the brand name of Tabitha Webb.’","Society designer Tabitha Webb 'owes thousands to suppliers in unpaid bills'

"She once loved him and treated him to toys and trips to the seaside, yet in a case that has shocked the nation, four-year-old Daniel Pelka’s mother ended up killing him, after months of appalling abuse. Daniel’s aunt, Sylwia Luczak, is still trying to comprehend how her older sister Magdelena, with lover Mariusz Krezolek, could have starved, tortured and beaten Daniel to death. And as the evil pair begin a life sentence in jail, she is still blaming herself for not realising the danger Daniel was in. The mother who tortured him: 27-year-old Magdelena Luczak locked her son Daniel Pelka, 4 in a room and systematically starved him. Her sister Sylwia said she was once a good mother . 'Callous and wretched': The judge who gave Daniel's mother Magdalena Luczak, 27, and his stepfather Mariusz Krezolek, 34 (left) life sentences said the scale of his suffering was horrific . ‘I blame myself – I wish I had asked more questions and discovered the truth,’ she told The Mail on Sunday. ‘Then Daniel might still be alive today.’ Sylwia, who was Daniel’s only other adult blood relative in the UK, said her sister had been a normal mother before she met Krezolek. ‘When Magda was pregnant with Daniel, she behaved like any other expectant mother,’ Sylwia said. ‘I saw them often when Daniel was little and I am sure she loved him. ‘She bought him toys and they went on trips with the whole family. Once they went to the seaside in Wales and another time to a theme park near Coventry. 'We were in and out of each other’s houses all the time. She had problems with alcohol but that didn’t seem to stop her being a normal mother.’ Sylwia, 24, continued: ‘Daniel was a lovely little boy. He seemed healthy and happy. It all stopped when she met Mariusz and gave birth to his child. 'The other siblings were treated OK but Daniel was a bit different. Perhaps that is why Mariusz took against him.’ Guilt: Sylwia said the family was happy before her sister met Mariusz Krezolek. She said she blames herself for not realising the danger Daniel was in . Daniel weighed just 1st 9lbs when he died in March last year. During his final months, his mother . and her lover starved him, forced him to perform punishment exercises, . locked him in a tiny room, poisoned him with salt and held him under . cold water until he lost consciousness. As . the authorities in Coventry investigate whether more could have been . done to save Daniel, it has emerged that teachers at his school, . Coventry’s Little Heath Primary, were offered counselling. At . school, the starving boy scavenged in bins, scoffed birthday cake and . filled his pockets with fruit from his class’ communal bowl but teachers . believed his mother’s lie that he had an eating disorder. Now Sylwia wants to know why social workers, police and teachers missed so many opportunities to save him. Three . weeks before he died, the starving boy, wearing just his underpants, . stood in front of consultant paediatrician Dr Supratik Chakraborty. He might have saved him had he acted, but instead he prescribed worming tablets and referred him for another appointment. Dr Chakraborty was yesterday unavailable for comment. Neighbours in Oadby, Leicestershire, said he and his family had gone to India for a short break. Luczak, 27, and Krezolek, 34, were jailed for at least 30 years after being found guilty of Daniel’s murder last week after a nine-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court. Sylwia, who lives near her sister’s former family home in Coventry, helped secure the convictions by giving evidence for the prosecution. Despite that, she has been ostracised by some of the city’s 30,000-strong Polish community and her house has been attacked, forcing the family to move to a secret address. In an emotional interview, Sylwia said she had cut herself off from her sister and would not visit her in prison. She blames the couple entirely for Daniel’s death and is amazed that school staff, doctors and child protection experts accepted their assurances that Daniel was not being mistreated. She also claims social workers accused her of having known he was being starved and beaten – something she fervently denies. ‘Please don’t misunderstand me,’ she said. ‘I hold Mariusz directly responsible for killing Daniel. And I hold my sister responsible for failing in her maternal duty to protect her child. 'I also blame myself. I wish I had asked more questions and discovered the truth. Then Daniel might still be alive today. Life imprisonment: Luczak, left, and Krezolek, right, systematically starved Daniel, poisoned him with salt and subjected him to water torture . Murdered schoolboy: Daniel Pelka died severely malnourished after being starved in the months leading up to his death by his mother and stepfather, who the judge said showed 'no remorse' ‘They lied to me just like they lied . to the council and the police. But all those professional people who . called at their home knew there was a small child in there. They knew . Mariusz was a violent drunk who beat up Magda. I can’t understand why . Daniel was allowed to remain in the house.’ Sylwia, . who is doing a college course in maths and English and hopes to find a . job as a  classroom teaching assistant, has two young children who . attend local schools. ‘At . my daughter’s school it has to be written down in a special book if a . pupil even grazes their knee. But Daniel was tortured and no one in . authority seems to have done anything about it or even noticed.’ Sylwia . said she had tried to persuade her sister to leave Krezolek. ‘I often . told Magda that she and Daniel should come and live with me because I . knew Mariusz was violent towards her. But she was frightened at what he . might do if she moved out.’ Between August and December 2010, the police twice notified Children’s Services that officers had been to the house following reports of domestic abuse. Under lock and key: Daniel was left in a box room in the family's Coventry home with nothing more than a dirty mattress to sleep on . Imprisoned: The door on Daniel's room had been tampered with so his siblings could not let him out . In January 2011, Krezolek broke Daniel’s arm in a violent assault but claimed the boy had fallen off a sofa. Social workers returned to the house in Coventry but decided to take no further action. There followed a well-documented series of visits by education welfare officials, concerned about his absence from school, and health workers specially trained in combating domestic violence. Daniel, who was born in Coventry, in July 2007, died in March last year, two days after Krezolek delivered a fatal blow to his head in what was described in court as the climax of an escalating and incomprehensible campaign of cruelty. No funeral has taken place yet because of the police investigation. Sylwia said: ‘My family want the body to be sent back to Poland. But I would like him to be buried here. He was born in Britain and this is where he should have grown up.’ Daniel’s two siblings, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, are in the care of fostering and adoption agencies. Child protection expert Dr Supratik Chakraborty was criticised during the trial for failing to spot Daniel’s malnutrition three weeks before he died. The little boy had initially been referred to the consultant paediatrician by a school nurse on October 10, after Luczak told her that Daniel had an ‘excessive appetite’ and would punch her when not allowed food. After a number of missed appointments, the expert finally got to examine Daniel on February 10, 2012. Dr Chakraborty, who looked at the boy in his underpants, confirmed that his body mass index had almost fallen off the measurable scale but decided to prescribe worming tablets and refer him for further investigation. At his post-mortem three weeks later, Daniel weighed only 1st 9lb and he was covered in 23 separate injuries. Professor Peter Milla, an expert in child malnutrition, told the court that his condition represented a campaign of sustained starvation that would have lasted for months. He said: ‘Malnutrition would have been present when he saw Dr Chakraborty – either he did not observe accurately or there was a dramatic change in the three weeks before death or both.’","Sylwia Luczak was four-year-old Daniel Pelka's only adult relative in the UK but didn't intervene in his abuse .

"Motorists using the M25 have had to put up with road works every day for the past three years, new figures reveal. The London orbital route has never been without a lane closure or diversion since May 2010, when the Coalition came  to power promising to reduce motorway congestion. The M1 has fared little better. It has been cone-free for only four days in that time, while the M4 has managed to chalk up just 12 days without disruption. The M25 has never been without a lane closure or diversion since May 2010 . At the other end of the scale is the M2. Drivers using the main route to the Channel ports have enjoyed 336 days without roadworks. Next best performer is the M23 between London and Gatwick Airport, where motorists have been spared maintenance and upgrading disruption on 297 days. Motoring organisations accepted the need for repairs but said delays could be reduced by better co-ordination of works to avoid repeated closures and reduced-speed stretches. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘The Highways Agency must recognise the impact works have on road users. The Highways Agency, which released the information, was  unable to say when the M25  was last free of roadworks . ‘Even limited lane closures can impact large numbers of people and the bill in terms of drivers’ time and money quickly ratchets up.’ The Highways Agency, which released the information following a Freedom of Information request, was  unable to say when the M25  was last free of roadworks. The 117-mile motorway  is currently undergoing a £129 million operation to renew the central reservation barrier between Junction 5 at Sevenoaks and Junction 6 at Godstone. The work is due to finish in the spring of 2015. The Highways Agency said: ‘The M25 is one of the busiest motorways in Europe and we have a robust proactive maintenance programme to ensure it remains at a high standard.’","The M25 has never been without a lane closure or diversion since May 2010 .

"Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli challenged a BBC commentator to meet her in her ‘ball gown and heels’ after he described her as ‘no looker’. The French star spoke out as John Inverdale was forced to make a grovelling on-air apology for comparing her unfavourably with previous winner Maria Sharapova. And last night, a stunning Miss Bartoli, 28, posed for photographers at the Champions’ Ball in London in a figure-hugging black dress. On Saturday, Inverdale told listeners on Radio Five Live: ‘Do you think Bartoli’s dad told her when she was little: “You’re never going to be a looker – you’ll never be a Sharapova – so you have to be scrappy and fight?”’ 'Not a looker': Stunning Marion  poses with the Venus Rosewater Dish trophy alongside Andy Murray  at the Wimbledon Championships 2013 Winners Ball England . Victory number 2: Miss Bartoli, 28, posed for photographers at the Champions’ Ball in London in a figure-hugging black dress. Earlier her looks were criticised by BBC pundit John Inverdale . Winner: Bartoli was attacked by Trolls on Twitter who criticised her looks and branded her as 'manly' Miss Bartoli said: ‘I invite this journalist to come and see me this evening in ball gown and heels, and in my opinion he could change his mind. 'I am not blonde, yes. Have I dreamt about having a model contract? No. But have I dreamed about winning Wimbledon? Absolutely.’ Bartoli’s father immediately rushed to her defence and the BBC was forced to apologise. The . French player’s father, Walter, who coached her until this year, said: . ‘The relationship between Marion and me has always been unbelievable so I . don’t  know what this reporter is talking about. ‘When she was five years old she was playing like every kid and having fun on the tennis court. She’s my beautiful daughter.’ Crass remark: John Inverdale has forced the BBC into making an appology after he suggested that Marion Bartoli the women's Wimbledon champion was 'never going to be a looker' Moment of glory: Marion Bartoli looked stunned after winning the ladies single title at Wimbledon yesterday . He was among friends and family who supported Marion from the players’ box – and she made a beeline for him after claiming her first grand slam title with a 6-1 6-4 victory over German Sabine Lisicki. Twitter users were also highly critical, describing the remark as ‘shameful’ and ‘absolutely disgusting’. One wrote: ‘John Inverdale is never going to be a looker, or a thinker, or as good at anything as Bartoli.’ Another . said: ‘I can’t believe John Inverdale is so unpleasant and sexist about . Marion Bartoli. Expect he will say, “It was just a joke”. No, it . wasn’t, John.’ She's a winner: Marion soaked up the applause at the winner's ball . Marion Bartoli poses for a picture during a press conference today in southwest London after winning the women's singles Wimbledon Championships title yesterday . A BBC spokesman said: ‘We accept that this remark was insensitive and for that we apologise.’ Inverdale also gave a grovelling apology today.

Murray and Novak Djokovic, Inverdale said: ‘Before we start, I probably . ought to just briefly return to yesterday and a clumsy phrase that I . used about Marion Bartoli which has understandably caused something of a . furore. ‘The point I . was trying to make, in a rather ham-fisted kind of way, was that in a . world where the public perception of tennis players is that they're all . 6ft tall Amazonian athletes, Mario - who is the Wimbledon champion - . bucks that trend.’ Comeback: Marion Bartoli today suggested the BBC journalist come and see her at the traditional end-of-Wimbledon ball in London . He said she was ‘a fantastic example to all young people that it's attitude and will and determination together, obviously, with talent that, in the end, does get you to the top. ‘So I have apologised to Marion by letter if any offence was caused and I do hope that we can leave the matter there now’. The apology came as Bartoli faced a barrage of abuse from vile online trolls who took to Twitter to criticise her looks, saying that she did not deserve to win as she is too 'ugly'. Another said: 'For the first time ever a man wins the women's Wimbledon final! Go team men. #balls' And she was also told to: 'get a boob job with the money you won. ugly b****'. But the Twitter attacks have prompted an outpouring of criticism online as with Bartoli supporters rushing to her defence. One said: 'Bartoli as the complete underdog has just won Wimbledon. WHY ARE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HER FACE AND BODY!!?!' Another added: 'Sadly being an amazing athlete counts for nothing if you're a woman :(' Bartoli . had endured a difficult 2013 before Wimbledon after failing to pass . the third round of any tournament. She had also never won a major tournament before. 'Honestly I just can't believe it,' she said. 'As a little girl I dreamt about this moment for so long. 'I . was there in 2007 and I missed out.

"The Met Office has been accused of damaging the UK’s tourism industry over its prediction last week that Britain faces the likelihood of a decade of soggy summers – because just three years ago it told us to prepare for repeats of the drought of 1976. In May 2010 its climate extremes scientist Eleanor Burke warned we would roast in the summer months and be faced with tap water bans. Yet last week yet another glimpse into the future by Met Office experts and colleagues from leading UK universities suggested rainy summers are on the cards for the foreseeable future. A sunbather basks on Brighton beach last week but the Met Office warns of a decade of soggy summers . A man is battered by heavy wind and rain on Southsea seafront. Three years ago The Met Office said hose pipe bans would be needed because of continually hot and dry summers . Back in 2010, Ms Burke said the nation should brace itself for a repeat of the extraordinary  16-month drought period up to August 1976 when some parts of England suffered 45 days in a row without rain, and temperatures stayed at 90F (32C). Emphasising the need to expect the worst, Ms Burke said preparations should include ‘designing buildings to cope with the heat, putting in place emergency plans in hospitals and schools, growing heat-resistant crops and (imposing) hose pipe bans’. Even more recently – in January 2012 – the government’s first Climate Change Risk Assessment, compiled with the help of Met Office scientists, predicted a decrease in summer rainfall over coming decades and sizzling sunshine that would persuade holidaymakers to stay at  home rather than head for the Mediterranean. But last week meteorologists at a Met Office conference into climate change in Exeter said a warmer North Atlantic meant Britain faced a higher chance of wet summers for up to ten years. Now tourism bosses have accused the experts of driving UK holidaymakers abroad by presenting ‘academic machinations’ as reliable weather predictions. A woman enjoys the sun in St James's Parl, London, last Wednesday - when weathermen predicted showers . The UK has seen severe summer flooding in recent years. Pictured: flooded businesses in the centre of Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire in June last year . One even suggested delegates to last . week’s conference should be made to bet their pensions on a decade of . soggy summers if they were so sure of their claims. The . anger has emerged most strongly in the South West – the most popular . holiday-at-home destination for Britons – where tourism leaders say a . bad summer forecast wipes out £300million worth of income in Devon and . Cornwall alone. Visit Cornwall head Malcolm Bell, said: ‘I wish that these so-called experts would keep their mouths shut. ‘In recent years the Met Office got the “barbecue summer” wrong, the hosepipe ban wrong – their credibility is shot. So why not just shut up. ‘If you run a campsite or have a seaside business it’s a massive problem. People thinking of a holiday are driven abroad or simply don’t bother. ‘A bad summer forecast brings a five to ten per cent drop in business. That’s a loss of £300million to Devon and Cornwall and a lot of jobs and businesses on the line. Tourism experts say businesses could lose money after the latest warning about soggy summers. Pictured, a flooded road in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire . ‘Are the forecasters prepared to put their salaries and pensions on that? Somehow I doubt it.’ He added: ‘There is absolutely no . certainty in long-range predictions. They are just academic machinations . but when they emerge they fuel British paranoia about the weather.’ The . North West, Britain’s third most popular domestic  holiday destination . thanks to the Lake District, is less weather-dependent. But Ian Stephens, of Cumbria Tourism, said long and medium term forecasts had ‘real potential to damage UK tourism’. ‘Meteorological organisations need to work with the tourism industry to better understand how weather influences the tourism decision-making process.’ Last night a Met Office spokesman said: ‘New research suggests long-term Atlantic currents may be playing an important role in wet summers. ‘These are understood to operate on cycles of a decade or more, and it appears we are well into the “wet” phase of this cycle. That does not mean every summer will be a washout. ‘We have worked with the tourism industry to provide detailed forecasts for 5,000 resorts, beaches and attractions so visitors can plan their day out with confidence and make the most of the great British weather come rain or shine.’ The assertion in this article that Met Office scientists had predicted a likelihood of a decade of soggy summers was based on reports of a Met Office science workshop in Exeter on June 18. The Met Office says those reports misrepresented scientists who were discussing early research and not making predictions. A more detailed explanation is provided in the Met Office news blog here.","In May 2010, experts said regular hosepipe bans would be needed .

"A peer caught up in a lobbying scandal is facing more embarrassing questions over claims that he was paid to host a reception costing £25,000 at Westminster on behalf of a green firm now under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. Lord Laird, who was recorded by undercover reporters apparently agreeing to lobby Ministers in return for money, organised the House of Lords event to promote the Sustainable Growth Group. Its founder and chairman, British businessman Gregg Fryett, is in prison in Cambodia after being arrested by anti-corruption police. The Ulster Unionist peer, who resigned the party whip earlier this month in the wake of the ‘cash-for-questions’ sting by the BBC’s Panorama, delivered a speech to more than 100 guests at the four-course dinner in 2011. The party later assembled on the House of Commons Terrace to sip champagne. It's a deal: Lord Laird (right) with, from left, Gregg Fryett, James . Whale and Ren Kapur, of Sustainable Economic Solutions. Ms Kapur has asked us to point out that she was employed as a consultant for Sustainable Economic Solutions which was a subsidiary of this Sustainable Growth group. She had no involvement in the investment activities of the companies. Mr Fryett, . founder and chairman of Sustainable Growth Group, is now in prison in . Cambodia after being arrested by anti-corruption police . Praising Mr Fryett in extravagant language, Lord Laird said his vision of a world less dependent on harmful sources of energy was truly exciting. ‘We’re on the cusp of a sustainable evolution greater than the industrial revolution of the 19th Century and the digital revolution of the 20th Century,’ he told assembled guests. However, a Mail on Sunday investigation, has discovered that the reality was shockingly different for up to 1,200 private individuals, many of whom were persuaded by independent financial advisers to unlock their pensions and move the money into eco-energy schemes run by Mr Fryett in South-East Asia. Mr Fryett, 47, who is originally from Torquay, has lived in Thailand for several years. He was arrested in March by Cambodian investigators as he tried to resolve problems over land ownership rights. He has since been held in the tough Prey Sar Prison (above) on the outskirts of the capital Phnom Penh . Solicitor Gareth Fatchett, who represents about 900 investors who fear they may have lost their savings, said: ‘These were ordinary people who were sold a dream of making a modest profit while saving the planet.’ The sums invested range from £30,000 to £400,000, according to Mr Fatchett. Total losses could be as high as £32million. Another of Mr Fryett’s companies, Sustainable Wealth Investments UK, which marketed ecological investment schemes, invited Lord Laird to chair its oversight committee, which was responsible for ensuring ‘the highest standards of governance and professionalism’ in the firm’s dealings with the public. Mr Fryett said yesterday that Lord Laird had sought a retainer of £3,000 a month to take on the role. Enticing: Literature relating to the House of Lords event . Speaking yesterday in the Cambodian jail where he has been held for the past three months, Mr Fryett said he fell out with Lord Laird when the peer allegedly asked Sustainable Growth Group to lend £100,000 to Christopher Knight, an American business associate who earlier this year was revealed to be a registered sex offender in Florida. The invitation to chair the committee was withdrawn because of a disagreement over the decision to lend money to Mr Knight and the retainer was never paid. At the heart of the investment opportunity endorsed by Lord Laird at the House of Lords lunch was an obscure plant called jatropha. It was initially hailed by environmentalists as a source of a revolutionary bio-fuel and Virgin Atlantic boss Sir Richard Branson once suggested that jatropha could make the high-polluting aviation industry more eco-friendly. However, it is now seen as having limited potential. Enthusiasm for it dimmed when the respected New Scientist journal calculated that an area twice the size of France would be needed to grow enough of the shrub to power the world’s airline fleet. The Sustainable Growth Group went into liquidation in February 2012 and the 15,000-acre site in Cambodia set aside for jatropha cultivation was abandoned. Mr Fryett, 47, who is originally from Torquay, has lived in Thailand for several years. He was arrested in March by Cambodian investigators as he tried to resolve problems over land ownership rights in relation to the jatropha plantation. He has since been held in the tough Prey Sar Prison on the outskirts of the capital Phnom Penh. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday at the jail yesterday, the divorced father of two, who insists he is an innocent victim of corruption, said his company hired Lord Laird to organise the parliamentary reception. ‘His role was to facilitate the use of the House of Lords,’ said Mr Fryett, who is suffering from suspected tuberculosis and has lost about 2.5st in prison, where he shares a 19ft long cell with more than 20 other inmates. ‘Lord Laird was paid as a speaker. I don’t know how much money he got because my colleagues organised that side of things.’ Four months after the reception, according to Mr Fryett, Lord Laird approached Sustainable Growth Group’s chief executive James Whale and asked him to arrange a short-term £100,000 loan to Mr Knight, who had employed the peer as an adviser during an attempt to take over the Belfast Giants ice hockey team. Mr Fryett said: ‘James told me, “Someone wants to borrow some money and Lord Laird is involved.” We had a lot of money in and it wasn’t going into agriculture at that time. We lent £75,000 and then another £25,000. It was supposed to be paid back within two weeks. The Mail on Sunday has established Lord Laird collaborated with Mr Fryett in a proposed scheme that involved trading carbon credits with indigenous communities in the Philippines. The peer wrote on official House of Lords notepaper to the queen of the Manobo tribe two years ago. Members of the tribe, pictured above . ‘When we started getting issues with Christopher Knight we stood that down [the invitation to Lord Laird to chair the oversight committee]. We had agreed a fee with Lord Laird but I am not sure if we paid him anything.’ Since his arrest Mr Fryett has had no communication with the peer. Mr Fryett accused the SFO of being overzealous in its investigation and claimed his business would have made a healthy profit if it had been given time to grow. ‘We would have been on the US Stock Exchange. If I was corrupt, I would be on a yacht in the Bahamas rather than in jail after coming back here to Cambodia to fight for the investors.’ This newspaper has also established that Lord Laird collaborated with Mr Fryett in a proposed scheme that involved trading carbon credits with indigenous communities in the Philippines. The peer wrote on official House of Lords notepaper to the queen of the Manobo tribe two years ago. Under the terms of the Kyoto Protocol on environmental protection, developing countries can ‘earn’ carbon credits and then trade them with Western companies. A carbon credit is defined as a certificate representing the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide. The forests of the Philippines soak up vast quantities of CO2. This gives the Manobo tribe a valuable ‘bank’ of carbon credits. Mr Fryett and Lord Laird are understood to have sought to acquire the right to sell some of these credits to overseas investors. In return, the tribe would be given a proportion of the profits. Tribal leaders withdrew from negotiations, concluding that a deal would not be in their interests. At the heart of the investment opportunity endorsed by Lord Laird at the House of Lords lunch was an obscure plant called jatropha (pictured). It was initially hailed by environmentalists as a source of a revolutionary bio-fuel - but it is now seen as having limited potential . Francis Hernandez, husband of queen Bae Merlin Coguit, said Lord Laird charmed them with offers to show the couple around the Palace of Westminster. Although the queen was unable to come to Britain, her name was added to a letter supporting Mr Fryett’s vision of a global ‘sustainable evolution’. Mr Hernandez told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Lord Laird invited us to Parliament but it didn’t happen. He was also supposed to come and see us but he wasn’t able to come so he sent his representative instead.’ US-educated Mr Hernandez admitted he had been flattered to receive a phone call from the peer. ‘It was an honour. He is in the House of Lords. He is royalty and I am just a commoner. ‘He said, “I am an indigenous person like you – I am from Ireland. I am also a worker for my people like you. So I appreciate what you are going through.” ’ A Serious Fraud Office spokesman said this week: ‘Our investigation is ongoing. No one has been charged.’ Mr Whale, who now works as an environmental consultant, confirmed that Lord Laird had been the intermediary in arranging the loan to Mr Knight, which he said had been approved by Mr Fryett. Mr Fryett’s UK lawyer has said his client went to Cambodia after receiving assurances from authorities that he would be treated as a victim of land fraud, not a suspect. Panorama reporters, posing as lobbyists for a fake company, recorded Lord Laird apparently setting out ways he could press for new laws on behalf of a South Korean solar power firm. He has denied wrong-doing and his conduct is now being investigated by the parliamentary standards watchdog. The Mail on Sunday made repeated efforts to contact Lord Laird in relation to our interview with Mr Fryett. We spoke to Lady Laird and sent a series of questions to Ulster Unionist Party press officer Stephen Barr. There was no response from Lord Laird. Mr Barr said: ‘We have had no contact with Lord Laird since the whip was withdrawn.’ No one was available for comment at Mr Knight’s last known address in Ford Lauderdale, Florida.","Cash-for-questions peer Lord Laird hosted party at Westminster to help business raise millions from pensions of 1,200 investors .

"Links being forwarded via Twitter actually make people's PCs part of Anonymous's 'denial of service' attacks against U.S. government sites and anti-piracy organisations . Hacker group Anonymous have become a cult hit on Twitter, with 249,000 followers - but security experts Sophos warn that fans, are being tricked into taking part in its attacks. Links being forwarded via Twitter actually make people's PCs part of Anonymous's 'denial of service' attacks against U.S. government sites and anti-piracy organisations. The links are being forwarded as part of Anonymous's recent 'Operation Megaupload' - a retaliation for the U.S. government 'taking down' a file-sharing site. They look like ordinary web links, but launch cyber attacks from whatever PC you access them on. People who click the links unwittingly become part of Anonymous's attacks - and hit any website that the 'hacktivist' group chooses. It's a change of tactics for Anonymous - and security experts warn that claiming you clicked on a link by accident may not be a defense. The attacks, a 'denial of service' attack, rely on thousands of PCs sending information to sites at once to crash them. 'In the past, Anonymous has . encouraged supporters to install a program called LOIC, which allows . computers to join in an attack on a particular website, blasting it with . unwanted traffic,' said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at . Sophos. 'This change in tactic from Anonymous, which allows attacks to . be launched by simply clicking on a link, means that internet users need . to be extremely careful when clicking on unknown URLs or they could . unwittingly be joining this latest zombie army.'

"As a bombed-out neighbourhood lies in a mass of broken stone and twisted metal in the background, a young boy sits amid the rubble of what was once his home in Gaza. These images reveal the startling reality of life in the area following the 50-day war with Israel as the region begins to recover from the fighting. A week after a cease-fire halted the war, families in Gaza have been returning to their homes shelled by Israel during Operation Protective Edge. Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-ended truce last Tuesday. The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting but left key issues unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of an Israel-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and seaports. A boy sits amid the rubble of his destroyed house on Monday in the Gaza Strip. Local residents visited their house that was shelled by Israel during Operation Protective Edge, in the Shejaia neighbourhood, east of Gaza City . These images reveal the startling reality of life in Gaza after the 50-day war with Israel as the region begins to recover from the fighting . Palestinians gather around a fire amid the rubble of their destroyed house in the Gaza Strip. Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-ended truce last Tuesday . Israel wants Hamas to disarm and the return of bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war. A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt. The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and U.N. estimates. Israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants, though it has not provided firm evidence to back its claims. On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed. Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities during the fighting, mostly in the south. The Israeli military, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks. The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U.N. schools turned into makeshift shelters. With tens of thousands of people still in the shelters and fighting still raging, education officials delayed the start of the school year last week. Ziad Thabet, a Gaza Education Ministry official, said classes in the strip are set to begin on September 14. The U.N. said most of the displaced were to be evacuated to temporary housing by yesterday afternoon, but Thabet said the schools need to undergo repairs before they can be used. At least 223 Gaza schools, either run by the U.N. refugee agency or the Hamas government, were hit in the fighting, including 25 that are too damaged for use. Israel has accused Hamas of using civilian buildings such as schools for military purposes.

The Israeli military, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks . Meanwhile, Palestinian militants from the Popular Front for the Liberation Of Palestine took part in a rally on Monday, a week after the beginning of the Egypt-mediated ceasefire. An opinion poll released today found the popularity of the Hamas militant group had spiked significantly among Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip following the war. The poll, conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research and headed by leading Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki, indicated that 61 per cent of Palestinians would choose the Islamic militant group's leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for president if Palestinian presidential elections were held today. Only 32 per cent would vote for current President Mahmoud Abbas, Hamas' rival, the survey suggested. A masked Palestinian militant of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), holds up his rifle on Monday in Gaza City during a rally held a week after the Egypt-mediated ceasefire between Israel and Hamas . An opinion poll released today found the popularity of the Hamas militant group had spiked significantly among Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip following the war. Pictured is a masked Palestinian militant of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The support for Haniyeh marks a stark increase from a poll in June, conducted by the same pollster, which found only 41 per cent of Palestinians backed the Hamas figure. At the time, Abbas had 53 percent support. The poll also suggests a majority of Palestinians - 72 per cent - support adopting Hamas' armed approach in the West Bank. The research center said it is the first time in eight years that a majority of Palestinians has voiced such support for the Hamas leader. But, it said, Hamas' popularity might fall in coming months, as it did following previous Israel-Hamas conflicts. Polling started on the last day of the war, on August 26, and continued during the first four days of the ceasefire, the research center said. The poll said 79 per cent of respondents believe Hamas won the war, and 86 per cent support the renewal of rocket fire on Israel if a blockade on Gaza is not lifted, one of Hamas' main demands. Palestinian militants from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestinian (PFLP) take part in a military show in Gaza City on Tuesday . Israeli Finance Minister Yair Lapid criticized Israel's expropriation of West Bank land announced this week, calling for 'a more reasoned approach' in Israeli diplomacy following Israel's military operation in Gaza. Pictured are Palestinian militants from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestinian (PFLP) But 25 per cent said armed groups in the Gaza Strip should give up their weapons after the blockade ends and elections are held. Also today, Israeli Finance Minister Yair Lapid criticized Israel's expropriation of West Bank land announced this week, calling for 'a more reasoned approach' in Israeli diplomacy following Israel's military operation in Gaza. The expropriation of about 1,000 acres of West Bank land could help clear the way for new Jewish settlement construction. Lapid said such moves create 'redundant arguments with the United States and the world' and criticized the timing of the announcement following the Gaza war. Israel's Justice Minister, Tzipi Livni, also criticized the move this week. Other leading Israeli Cabinet ministers have criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conduct in the recently concluded war, with many saying he did not go far enough to neutralize Hamas's fighting ability.

Netanyahu has spoken vaguely about a new 'diplomatic horizon' that has emerged following the 50-day Israel-Hamas war. He has given few details on what he means. But Netanyahu has said that he is not willing to renew peace talks with Abbas, saying the Palestinian leader will have to first distance himself from Hamas militants. Hamas and Abbas' Palestinian Authority recently agreed to a unity deal that saw the formation of a government backed by both factions. 'He has to choose,' Netanyahu told Israeli Channel Two in a weekend interview. 'It's either yes to Hamas or no to Hamas.' Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars rained on their communities during the 50-day Israel-Hamas war, while schools in Gaza remained shuttered as the territory recovered from the fighting. The start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to rocket-scarred communities in southern Israel, but the signs of the fighting remained fresh. In the southern city of Ashdod, employees at the 'Pashosh' kindergarten, which was struck by a rocket, removed shrapnel marks off the walls and slides ahead of the students' arrival. 'We are a little scared but we are excited,' said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher in its school. 'A lot of children in our area really need to go back to a routine.' In Gaza, Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U.N. schools turned into makeshift shelters. With tens of thousands of people still in the shelters and fighting still raging, education officials delayed the start of the school year last week.

Another favourite is a softly fitted yellow and royal purple print dress by Hugo Boss which made its first appearance in summer 2012 before being dusted off the following year and spruced up with a black blazer.

"Fernando Torres hogs the Italian football headlines as AC Milan's new No 9 gets set for his full debut for the club on Tuesday night against Empoli. La Gazzetta dello Sport reports the Chelsea exile will make his first start for the Rossoneri against Empoli in the Serie A after a cameo from the bench in their 1-0 loss to Juventus saw him finish with a yellow card instead of the goal his side needed.

He’ll start against Cesena on Wednesday.

"An experimental drug given to a seriously ill Virginia boy after his parents' high-profile plea to a drugs company is starting to take effect. Just last week seven-year-old Josh Hardy was fighting for his life after contracting a virus that was causing internal bleeding, and heart and kidney failure. But, after just three doses of Brincidofovir, which is not yet available on the market, Josh is starting to make progress and the virus is leaving his body. On the mend: The virus attacking Josh's body has nearly gone after just three doses of the new drug . Relief: Josh's family posted this picture of him getting his first dose of the experimental drug . As well as the levels of adenovirus falling, the bleeding in the cancer survivor's stomach and intestines has stopped. It is a long way from where he was a week ago, when the seven-year-old could barely speak and was vomiting blood, while his family kept a desperate vigil at his bedside in a Memphis hospital. Campaign: Chimerix chief executive Kevin Moch agreed to make the drug available after a campaign . His mother, Aimee, who campaigned to get drug company Chimerix to give her son their new drug, said: 'I'm beside myself with how effective this drug was so quickly.' she told CNN they expect the virus to have left his system by Tuesday. Josh's body, weakened by chemotherapy after he had cancer for the fourth time, was struggling to fight of the adenovirus. The only available drugs were not working and Chimerix has refused to give the family access to experimental medication Brincidofovir. But, after his family launched a high-profile media campaign, Chimerix relented. The company, in return, has been allowed to use data from Josh to help its FDA application, which could bring the drug on the market earlier. Chimerix . chief Kenneth Moch announced on Tuesday last week that his firm will begin a . pilot trial for the drug immediately - with Josh as the program's . first patient. Moch had faced huge criticism for denying the . Fredericksburg boy Brincidofovir to fight off an . infection he developed after a bone marrow transplant. In a statement, Moch said that after much careful consideration Chimerix would offer Josh the medicine. 'This . 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix's mission to develop . innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need - for . everyone,' Moch said according to Fox News. 'Being . unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and . not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. 'It . is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with . equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further . clinical study of Brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus . and other serious DNA viral infections.' Survivor: Josh Hardy has survived four bouts of kidney cancer, heart failure and a bone marrow transplant . Frail: Before getting the drug Josh was in intensive care, with his heart and kidneys failing . Although physically Josh's condition has improved, his mom says he appears to have lost his motivation after months of ill health. She told CNN his once-positive attitude appears to have gone and he appears exhausted. 'I haven't seen him smile lately,' she said. And, although the virus appears to be going, Josh has suffered severe kidney damage after being given other drugs to try to halt the virus. He has to have dialysis three times a week and could need it for the rest of his life - something that haunts Mrs Hardy. 'If he could have gotten the Brincidofovir earlier, it could have been avoided. That will always bother me,' she said. The drug has not been approved by the FDA, but has previously been administered to hundreds of other patients under a prior 'compassionate use' allowance. Fight: Aimee Hardy, pictured with Josh, second left, and her other children, campaigned to get access to the experimental treatment . Hope: Josh's family say the virus that was killing him could be gone by next week . Previously Moch said that saying yes to Josh would mean saying yes to many more patients, draining the company's resources and delaying the time it will take for the drug to progress through the formal studies required before it can be given FDA approval and help many more future patients. However, the company received $72 million in federal funding to develop Brincidofovir. Before she was able to secure the drug for her son, Mrs Hardy said the situation was devastating, especially for a boy who has fought so hard to live. 'There’s no good excuse for us,' she said. 'There’s nothing they can say that will really keep us from asking. We’re begging them to give it to us.' Josh's doctors also contacted Chimerex requesting their patient be allowed to have the drug. Josh was diagnosed with cancer of the kidneys in 2007. Since then, he has battled the disease four times. He had been in remission for two years when a bone scan in November of 2013 revealed he had developed a bone marrow disorder due to earlier cancer treatments. In January of this year he had a bone marrow transplant and endured another round of chemotherapy at St Jude's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Following the successful surgery he developed adenovirus, an infection that can be deadly in people with weakened immune systems. Exhausted: Although the virus looks like it is going away, Josh's mom says the seven-year-old has lost his spark . 'Normally, Josh’s immune system would be able to handle the adenovirus if his immune system was set free,' Mrs Hardy wrote on her son’s CaringBridge page. 'The challenge is his immune system can’t be set free yet because his body is still trying to adapt to the new bone marrow cells. So to keep the body from killing the new cells, they have to suppress the immune system, thus creating ideal conditions for adenovirus to advance. Catch 22.' Brincidofovir has been shown to clear up adenovirus in children in two weeks, reports Fox and Friends.","Cancer survivor Josh Hardy was fighting for his life after getting virus .

"Having regular TV-free days can prevent you becoming overweight, the health watchdog is advising. On other days, avoid eating meals in front of the television and limit yourself to just two hours’ viewing, it says. The advice, in guidelines issued by NICE – the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence – is similar to a campaign in the US that has seen people encouraged to have one TV-free day a week. The 42 pages of guidelines are aimed at those who are in good health and not overweight. Scroll down for video . Health watchdog NICE has advised people to avoid eating meals in front of the television . They also advise sticking to low-fat milk and yoghurts, cutting meat out of meals as much as possible, and having breakfast – ideally wholegrain cereal or toast – to stop the temptation of mid-morning biscuits or a pastry. NICE says that obesity levels have risen to such an extent that men and women of a healthy weight are now in the minority. The average adult is a stone overweight and only 30 per cent of men and 40 per cent of women could consider themselves slim. Some have questioned why NICE has produced such detailed guidelines for the healthy when there are more pressing issues. Obesity rates have nearly doubled over the last ten years, according to Professor Mike Kelly . But Professor Mike Kelly, director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, defended the guidelines, being emailed to doctors, councils and other groups. He said: ‘Obesity rates have nearly doubled over the last ten years and continue to be a huge concern. Following a healthier diet and being more physically active is important for everyone, not just if you are already overweight or obese. ‘We all know we should probably take the stairs rather than the lift, cut down on TV time, eat more healthily and drink less alcohol. But it can be difficult to know the most useful changes that we can make.’ NICE says that aside from encouraging a couch potato lifestyle, watching TV makes us more inclined to eat snacks due to constant adverts for food. Those who have dinner in front of the television tend to eat more as they are distracted from enjoying the meal so feel less satisfied. The watchdog did not say whether families should introduce TV-free days monthly or one day a week – for example, at the weekend. But in the US some schools encourage TV-free Tuesdays – or entire weeks without TV – with the time spent doing exercise instead. Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum said: ‘Advice is one thing: getting millions of people to do what it says on the tin is quite another. ‘What should be done is that we should be educated into a healthy lifestyle at a young age.’ Dr Ian Campbell, a GP and expert in obesity, said he hopes more of his patients would follow the advice. ‘We shouldn’t lose sight of the simple principle that prevention is better than cure,’ he said. ‘The advice given, though at first glance it may appear simplistic, is actually based on sound evidence.’ A proposal to offer free weight loss surgery for the obese could lead to up to 100 deaths a year, a leading academic has warned. Professor Iain Broom, from Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, also said it will cost the health service more than first thought. In July, NICE issued draft guidelines recommending weight loss surgery to almost one million obese adults with type 2 diabetes. But Professor Broom, of the university’s Centre for Obesity Research and Epidemiology, said that although the surgery was relatively safe, patients are high risk as they are obese. He said that statistically one in every 200 die, meaning that if an extra 20,000 patients a year have surgery – as predicted – there will be 100 more deaths. Professor Broom also said NICE had failed to take into account the extra costs of monitoring the patients after surgery and extra operations to replace gastric bands, for example. Experts claim the proposals would cost the NHS anywhere between £100million and £4.5billion, but Professor Broom said care afterwards would add £14million. Professor Broom, who has written an article for Health Service Journal, said it would be cheaper and more effective to put patients on low calorie diets.","NICE advised people to avoid eating meals in front of the television .

"Boys as well as girls should be given the HPV jab to prevent rising rates of cancer, according to experts. The vaccine is currently given to girls aged 12 and 13 to protect against the human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer. But the virus is actually thought to trigger 5 per cent of all cancers worldwide including those affecting 2,000 men a year. Girls aged 12 and 13 are currently offered the HPV vaccine to help protect against cervical cancer, which is caused by the human papillomavirus . A committee of experts working for the Department of Health are currently deciding whether boys aged 12 to 13 should also be offered the vaccine. Campaigners say it would save lives, avoid needless suffering and spare the NHS millions of pounds in treatment costs. The vaccines would be offered on a voluntary basis to boys at school and would cost the health service up to £22 million annually. HPV is spread via sexual contact and causes cervical cancer in women as well as cancer of the throat, anus and penis. The experts – the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation – met yesterday are expected to make a final decision next month. Girls aged 12 and 13 have been offered the jab on a voluntary basis since 2008 and around 80 per cent have it. Peter Baker, Campaign Director of HPV Action.org,  said it was 'blatantly unfair' that women were protected from cancers and other diseases caused by HPV infection while men were not. ‘Men will continue to die from HPV-related diseases unless the government acts to extend the national vaccination programme to all adolescent boys,’ he said. ‘This would only cost about £20-£22 million a year and, in the long run, save the money spent by the NHS on treatment as well as reducing human suffering. ‘If parents knew that their sons as well as their daughters could be protected from the virus that causes 5 per cent of all cancers, then I'm sure most would also agree.' Earlier this month MPs from the All-Party Parliamentary Groups on Cancer, Dentistry, Sexual and Reproductive Health, Men's Health and HIV and Aids said more than 2,000 cases of cancer in men each year in the UK were caused by HPV. In an open letter they wrote: ‘The long-term savings in treatment and care of men with HPV-related diseases would considerably outweigh the extra cost (about £20 million a year) of extending the programme.’ Dr Kate Soldan, head of HPV surveillance at Public Health England, the Department of Health agency in charge of vaccines said it would provide ‘few additional benefits.’ The Department of Health is currently debating whether to extend the vaccination programme to include boys aged 12 and 13, to help protect against HPV (pictured). The virus is linked to cancer of the throat, anus and penis - affecting around 2,000 men each year .","Girls aged 12 and 13 are offered the jab to protect against cervical cancer .

"Fizzy drinks and sweet treats should be doubled in price to prevent an epidemic of tooth decay, according to researchers. They are calling for a 100 per cent sugar tax to be slapped on soft drinks and confectionary to deter the public from consuming such vast quantities. Earlier this year the chief medical officer Professor Dame Sally Davies conceded that a sugar tax may be necessary to tackle obesity although ministers say there are no plans for such measures. Figures show that 500 children are admitted to hospital every week with rooting teeth and more than a quarter of youngsters have some degree of decay . But researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Medicine say it is urgently needed to prevent rotting teeth in adults and children. They say the NHS now spends more treating tooth decay than any other illness apart from cancer and it causes so much pain it severely impacts patients’ quality of life. Figures show that 500 children are admitted to hospital every week with rotting teeth and more than a quarter of youngsters have some degree of decay. Professor Philip James, lead researcher, said a number of drastic proposals were needed including sugar tax of at least 20 per cent but ideally 100 per cent. This would raise the price of a can of Coke to 84p, a Mars bar to £1.20 and a Cornetto ice cream to £2.50. Writing in the journal BMC Public Health, he also called for other drastic measures including schools to stop serving fruit juice and vending machines to be banned from public places. Professor James said: ‘A sugars tax should be developed to increase the cost of sugar-rich food and drinks. ‘This would be simplest as a tax on sugar as a mass commodity, since taxing individual foods depending on their sugar content is an enormously complex administrative process. ‘The retail price of sugary drinks and sugar rich foods needs to increase by at least 20 per cent to have a reasonable effect on consumer demand so this means a major tax on sugars as a commodity. ‘The level will depend on expert analyses but my guess is that a 100 per cent tax might be required. Two cans of fizzy drinks and the 20 teaspoons of sugar they contain - the chief medical officer Professor Dame Sally Davies conceded that a sugar tax may be necessary to tackle obesity . ‘Vending machines offering confectionery and sugary drinks in areas controlled or supported financially by local or central government should be removed. ‘We are not talking draconian policies to ‘ban’ such sugar-rich products, which are available elsewhere, but no publicly-supported establishment should be contributing to the expensive problems of dental caries, obesity and diabetes.’ ‘We need to make sure that use of fruit juices and the concept of sugar-containing treats for children are not only no longer promoted, but explicitly seen as unhelpful.’ He also said nurseries and schools should stop serving sugar-rich drinks including fruit juice and treats. The Government says it has no plans for a sugar tax and instead is working with food and drinks manufacturers to make products less sweet. Only yesterday, American researchers said that sugar – not salt- was to blame for high blood pressure. Dr James DiNicolantonio, a heart disease specialist at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, said it affects a key area of the brain that causes the heart rate to quicken.","Fizzy drinks and sweets should be doubled in price, researchers say .

"Obesity is a ‘slow-motion car crash’ which is threatening to bankrupt the NHS, according to its chief executive. Simon Stevens said the problem is now more deadly than smoking and causing millions to suffer life-long illness and disability. He also revealed that – absurdly – the NHS is spending far more on drastic weight loss surgery than trying to prevent the problem in the first place. A quarter of adults and a fifth of children are now considered obese and the rates have almost doubled in 20 years. The NHS is spending far more on drastic weight loss surgery than trying to prevent the problem in the first place, its chief executive, Simon Stevens, has revealed . And figures show the NHS spends anywhere between £5 billion and £9 billion a year treating obese patients and related complications such as diabetes. Next month, Mr Stevens will publish a set of plans to tackle the problem which will see the NHS and private firms urged to do more to help staff lose weight. Doctors and nurses will be encouraged to be healthy role models for patients and hospitals told to ban junk food from canteens. NHS trusts and private companies will also be urged to help staff lose weight by holding slimming classes, running clubs or just providing bike racks at work. Mr Stevens, who took up post last April, said: ‘Obesity is the new smoking, and it represents a slow-motion car crash in terms of avoidable illness and rising health care costs. ‘If as a nation we keep piling on the pounds around the waistline, we'll be piling on the pounds in terms of future taxes needed just to keep the NHS afloat.’ Addressing a conference hosted by Public Health England in Coventry, he added: ‘It's bizarre that we are spending more nationally on bariatric surgery than we are on implementing at scale evidence-based programmes to prevent diabetes. ‘If we are serious about this then between NHS England and Public Health England we are going to have to switch some of our investment - not having futile arguments about who is paying for what. He added: ‘There is a danger we are sleepwalking into an unhealthy future. ‘The NHS is not a national role model when it comes to supporting staff to stay healthy. Only a third of trusts give support to lose weight. Mr Stevens also criticised WH Smith which encourages customers to buy supersized bars of chocolate for reduced rates alongside their magazine or newspaper. Referring to own experience at a branch at London’s Euston station yesterday (Weds) morning, he added: ‘They didn't say would you like a banana with that they said how about the chocolate?' The proposals unveiled next month are expected to call for companies to be offered tax incentives by the Government to encourage staff to be healthier. A quarter of adults and a fifth of children are now considered obese and the rates have almost doubled in 20 years. This could mean they are given tax relief on national insurance if they install gyms, provide healthy food in canteens or arrange running clubs at lunchtime. Hospitals and GP organisations will also be told to lead by example by offering fitness classes, support for staff trying to lose weight and by banning junk food. Mr Stevens is also understood to be in favour of companies offering financial incentives for staff to lead healthier lifestyles. He personally benefitted from such a scheme offered by his former company UnitedHealth, a private healthcare firm based in Minneapolis, the USA. Mr Stevens, 48, was able to lose three stone he had put on through an unhealthy American lifestyle partly thanks to incentives which offer employees reduced health insurance for meeting certain goals. Other companies provide shopping vouchers to staff for losing weight or maintaining their blood pressure within the healthy range. Researchers estimate that the NHS spends £5 billion annually treating obesity although this doesn’t include the £9 billion annual bill for type 2 diabetes. MrStevens added that obesity is now more deadly than smoking and causing millions to suffer life-long illness and disability. And last year, the health service carried out 9,336 weight loss operations which typically cost between £5,000 and £15,000 a time, depending on the procedure. This means that based on an average cost per operation of £10,000, the NHS spends nearly £100 million a year on weight loss surgery. Mr Stevens also wants local councils to use lessons learned by New York where fast food chains are forced to display the calorie content of their products. The city’s mayor, Michael Bloomberg, also attempted to ban the sale of supersized fizzy drinks last year although the law was thrown out by judge after the food industry appealed. Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said obesity was the ‘greatest public health emergency we face today.; . ‘The UK’s obesity rate is worryingly high and this has fuelled the massive rise we have seen in Type 2 diabetes over the last couple of decades. ‘We are now in a position where diabetes accounts for 10 per cent of the entire NHS budget and if things carry on as they are it will bankrupt our healthcare system.’ Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, the Government agency responsible for tackling obesity said:’He rightly highlighted the health and economic costs to society if as a nation we do not act now. ‘His focus on reducing obesity in the NHS workforce and limiting high fat and sugary foods in hospitals is especially important as they are role models for the public.’","Simon Stevens said obesity is causing millions to suffer life-long illness .

"Tens of thousands of middle-aged adults are developing dementia, a report will warn this week. More than 42,000 Britons under the age of 65 are thought to have the illness - twice as many as was previously thought. This includes 2,000 who are in their forties. Charities warn that many adults are coming to terms with the condition whilst still working, looking after children and paying off their mortgage. They are also concerned that doctors are misdiagnosing many younger sufferers as they assume dementia mainly occurs in the elderly. Fears: A new study has found that 42,000 people in the UK are suffering from early-onset dementia . But a report by the Alzheimer’s Society to be published on Wednesday will warn that twice as many adults are developing dementia in mid-life than previously thought. There are now 42,325 cases of early onset dementia in UK – which occurs before the age of 65 – previously there were only thought to be 17,000 cases. This includes 2,010 in their 40s, 7,700 cases in their 50s, 32,000 in their 60s and 707 cases in their 30s. Men are slightly more at risk than women – they account for 21,519 cases compared to 20,806. And overall, the under 65s are believed to account for a third of all cases of dementia. Jeremy Hughes, chief executive at Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘For too long dementia has been perceived as a natural part of ageing which only affects the oldest of the old in our society. ‘Say the word Alzheimer’s and many people picture a frail, elderly person in a care home. ‘The risk of developing dementia does increase with age, but the reality is that dementia is caused by diseases of the brain that don’t discriminate. Worrying: The report will also warn that the numbers of Britons with early-onset dementia will rise by a fifth by 2051. File picture . ‘Many people will be coming to terms with the symptoms while still in work, perhaps looking after children and paying a mortgage. ‘Too often we hear of people reporting memory loss to their doctor in mid-life, but being misdiagnosed because they are considered too young to have dementia.’ The report will also warn that the numbers of Britons with early-onset dementia will rise by a fifth by 2051 to 50,000 cases. Many of those who develop the illness at a younger age have a family history although it is also triggered by alcohol and linked to Down’s Syndrome. The most recent figures show that 850,000 Britons have dementia although the report this week will warn the numbers are significantly higher. Ministers are becoming increasingly concerned at the burden the illness is placing on the health service. And despite decades of research, drug companies have failed to find a cure or even a treatment to halt the illness’s progression. Last year David Cameron promised to double the funding for dementia research in the hope of that there will be a major breakthrough by 2025. Recently there have been a number of setbacks and several drugs which initially seemed promising were later found to be ineffective. Researchers are now focusing their efforts on developing treatments to give to patients very early on possibly before symptoms develop. The few existing drugs only work in people who are diagnosed very early on and they only temporarily halt the disease’s progression. Symptoms include memory problems, confusion, hallucinations and problems with language, speech and moving around. On average patients live for between eight and ten years after symptoms first occur but it varies hugely between individuals.","More than 42,000 Britons under the age of 65 are thought to have the illness .

"Statins could protect against blindness and amputations caused by diabetes, researchers have found. Diabetes patients taking the cholesterol-lowering drugs were up to 40 per cent less likely to develop these complications. Experts believe the pills may have the added benefit of reducing inflammation in the eye and nerve damage in limbs – which in severe cases can lead to feet being amputated. Statins could protect against blindness and amputations caused by diabetes, researchers found (file picture) Around 29 per cent of patients with diabetes suffer damage to the blood vessels in the eye, leading to sight problems and one in ten develop foot ulcers. The complications are debilitating for patients and cost the NHS up to £14billion a year. Danish researchers looked at 62,716 patients with diabetes aged over 40, during a three-year period. A quarter of them happened to be taking statins for high cholesterol, and the rest had never been prescribed the pills. The study, published in the Lancet medical journal, showed that patients on statins were 40 per cent less likely to develop sight problems and 34 per cent less at risk of nerve damage. Lower risk: Diabetes patients taking the cholesterol-lowering drugs were up to 40 per cent less likely to develop these complications (file picture) They were 12 per cent less likely to get gangrene in the foot – as a result of an ulcer caused by nerve damage – which often leads to amputation. The researchers, led by Professor Børge G Nordestgaard, chief physician in clinical biochemistry at Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark, were surprised by the findings. They had expected statins would make patients more likely to suffer complications, because they further raise blood sugar levels. Other experts think an added benefit of the drugs is that they reduce inflammation in the nerves, preventing them from damage. In July, health watchdog NICE issued controversial guidelines urging GPs to prescribe statins to 17million patients to prevent heart disease. There is a growing body of research suggesting statins also protect against other illnesses including dementia and certain cancers. But some experts said it was far too early for doctors to consider prescribing statins to all patients with diabetes to prevent complications. Dr David Preiss, from the British Heart Foundation’s cardiovascular research centre at the University of Glasgow, said: ‘Statins also have anti-inflammatory effects which might slow the progression of microvascular disease (in the small blood vessels) in the eye or kidney. ‘For now, however, any benefit of statins on microvascular complications remains unproven.’ Around 2.9million Britons have diabetes, and 90 per cent of these have Type 2, which is mainly caused by obesity. The numbers have increased by 50 per cent in less than a decade. The NHS spends £14billion a year treating diabetes, and most of this is on complications. Simon O’Neill, from the charity Diabetes UK, said: ‘Further research will be needed to find out if statins can actively help to reduce the risk of such complications. ‘The best way for people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes to reduce their risk of complications is by taking prescribed diabetes medications and by maintaining a healthy weight through increased physical activity and eating a healthy balanced diet.’","Statins could protect against blindness caused by diabetes, researchers find .

"Cutting costs: Doctors are being urged to cut costs by slashing the number of patients they send for cancer tests, a report by Cancer Research UK warns . Doctors are being urged to cut costs by slashing the number of patients they send for cancer tests, a charity warns. GPs are being told by NHS bosses to reduce referral rates despite wanting more patients screened in the hope that the disease will be picked up at an earlier stage. A report by Cancer Research UK says waiting times for treatment are at their highest in four years. Almost 10,000 waited at least two months from being referred by their GP to surgery, medication or chemotherapy in the first half of 2014. This means the NHS has breached its target of ensuring that 85 per cent of patients are treated within this time frame – it now stands at 84.4 per cent. The charity warns that the cash-strapped health service is struggling to cope with the rising numbers with cancer. More than 331,000 Britons were diagnosed with the disease last year, up by a quarter compared with the 1970s. The report warns that unless the NHS invests more money in cancer, waiting times will rise further – which could lead to a drop in survival rates. Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK’s chief executive, said: ‘In many ways, NHS cancer services have held up remarkably well. ‘Staff have bravely dug-in and done their best in the face of overwhelming change, increased demand, squeezed budgets and fragmented leadership. But that cannot continue indefinitely. 'More people are surviving cancer than ever before – survival rates in the UK have doubled in the last 40 years because research is delivering better diagnosis and treatments. ‘But the number of cases is also going up as the UK population ages. 'This combination means we’ll be diagnosing more people, treating more people and helping more people recover from cancer in coming decades. Scroll down for video . Treatment: Almost 10,000 patients waited at least two months from being referred by their GP to surgery, medication or chemotherapy in the first half of 2014 (file picture) ‘The NHS will need to be fit to meet that purpose and that needs increased investment, planning and leadership now.’ The charity interviewed doctors who said they were being discouraged by NHS clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) – which organise delivery of services – from referring too many patients for tests to diagnose cancer. One GP said: ‘We’re trying to get people diagnosed earlier, which means an increased referral rate from primary care. You’ve got to increase referral rates to get people in at an early stage of disease. ‘The CCG mantra is exactly opposite of that. You have to reduce your referral rate.’ And one hospital manager warned that there might soon be a shortage of beds and nurses for patients needing chemotherapy. Mike Hobday, director of policy and research at Macmillan Cancer Support, said cancer services were in a state of ‘utter confusion and uncertainty’. But Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said: ‘The NHS is successfully seeing 50 per cent more patients than four years ago and survival rates have never been higher. ‘Almost nine out of ten patients say their care is excellent or very good.’","GPs are urged to slash number of patients they send for tests, report warns .

"The Catholic Church is considering a ban on godparents at christenings to curb mafia influence. An archbishop in one of southern Italy’s mafia strongholds has proposed a 10-year ban on naming godparents at religious ceremonies to prevent the church being ‘exploited’ to create bonds between mafia clans. Mob clans use baptisms and confirmations to create alliances between criminal families and the role of godfather, or 'padrino,' helps them forge bonds with the next generation. Condemned: Pope Francis has excommunicated mafia clans for their evil deeds . Pope Francis visited a mafia powerbase in June and condemned mobsters in the strongest possible terms, saying they were ‘excommunicated’ for their evil deeds. Previously he has called on them to repent. Msgr. Giuseppe Fiorini Morosini says he initially put forward the idea to ban godfathers two years ago but it was rejected by the Vatican's Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. Msgr Morosini is the archbishop of Reggio Calabria, in the toe of Italy, controlled by Italy’s most ruthless mafia, the Ndrangheta. They are responsible for an estimated 80 per cent of Europe’s cocaine imports and have links with everyone from the IRA to the Colombian cartels.

Movie portrayal: The famous baptism scene in The Godfather, with Al Pacino as mobster Michael Corleone . Following Francis’ comments, Msgr Morosini has raised his proposal again, discussing it with the pope at the Vatican last weekend. He said Francis was open to the idea and asked him to confer with fellow bishops before reporting back to him. Msgr Morosini said suspending godfathers at mafia christenings would be ‘a powerful decision’. He said that the Ndrangheta mafia was founded on family relationships that were often 'broadened and strengthened' through the bosses' access to sacraments such as baptism and confirmation. He told the Italian newpaper La Repubblica: 'This measure could help to stop this expansion, which from a mafia perspective, is fundamental.’","Mob clans use baptisms and confirmations to build ties between families .

"Ex-golf coach Andrew Nisbet, 32, has admitted to several of the molestation and murder solicitation accusations against him . A popular California youth golf coach has admitted to molesting three of his male students and attempting to hire a hit man from behind bars to kill some of the victims. Andrew Nisbet, 32, on Thursday pleaded guilty to three of his child molestation charges, three counts of solicitation of murder and one count of possession of child pornography, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. The guilty plea comes as part of a deal with Alameda County prosecutors, which will also require him to register as a sex offender for the rest of  his life. Under the deal, Nisbet will be sentenced to more than 27 years behind bars on Oct. 27, according to the Chronicle. The charges he's admitted to are only a handful of the 75 felonies stacked against him for molesting three boys ages 12 to 17. Prosecutors say he wrote letters from his cell in Santa Rita Jail in Dublin talking about having two of the young men 'taken care of,' court records show. Nisbet's letters containing information about the alleged victims eventually wound up in the hands of a confidential informant, who told about them to a sheriff's deputy in February. Alameda County district attorney's Inspector Jeff McCort wrote in an affidavit that Nisbet penned additional letters to the informant acting as an intermediary agreeing on a price for each hit. An undercover district attorney's inspector visited Nisbet in jail posing as a gun-for-hire and secretly recorded their conversation. Instructor: Nisbet had tutored students at Las Positas Golf Course in Livermore since 2006 and was arrested in December 2013 . Well connected: Nisbet is seen here accepting a . PGA junior league award last year from US Ryder Cup Captain Davis Love . III as his students pass their time in an airport playing cards as seen . on his Facebook page . The agent described himself to Nisbet . as a 'mechanic and said he could fix a car for him and made a . pistol-shooting motion with his hand,'the Chronicle reported. The admitted pedophile replied by saying that there were two 'cars' that were in need of fixing in Pleasanton and Santa Barbara. One of his victims goes to college near Santa Barbara. The bogus assassin then asked Nisbet to name the Santa Barbara resident. The former golf coach mouthed the name and said the 'car' was 21 years old. The Livermore coach suggested to the undercover officer that he should steal the victims' cell phones to make the hits look like robberies. Nisbet then offered to pay for the hits up front to prove to the 'mechanic' that he was serious. When officials searched Nisbet's cell a week later, they discovered driving directions to the home of the victim from Pleasanton and a heap of letters written by the suspect to the informant discussing the alleged assassination plot. Nisbet, who is married, had tutored students at Las Positas Golf Course in Livermore since 2006 and was arrested in December 2013 — just  a day before he was due to receive a PGA award for Coach of the Year at the prestigious Contra Costa Country Club. Court documents charge Nisbet, who also operated the GRIP Junior Golf Academy, with performing oral sex on his victims in his car from December 2009 through March 2012 and showing them pornography on his phone. At least one of the victims was as young as 12 when the abuse happened. He also showed the children child pornography, court records show. Some of the sex acts were committed by Nisbet in the golf clubs parking lot and during out-of-town golfing excursions. Livermore police officer Steve Goard said that authorities became aware of the allegations when one of Nisbet's golf students reported that he was abused last November. Las Positas Golf Course fired Nisbet at the time of his arrest. Worrying: Nisbet was arrested at Las Positas Golf Course in Livermore - the day before he was due to receive the prestigious PGA's 2013 Junior Golf Leader Award . 'He befriended them as the cool coach, gave them rides to and from practice and bought them gifts, including top-of-the-line golf equipment,' Goard said to the San Jose Mercury News. 'He created a coach-athlete bond and, as he did, was figuring out who he could get away with it with.' Nisbet was hauled to jail on Dec. 7, 2013, on the golf course while he was working. During his initial interview, police said he admitted to some lewd acts with the children. His wife of two years, Kimberly Patrick Nisbet, has not commented on the allegations and appears to have moved out of the family home in Livermore, which is next door to Jackson Elementary School. According to his biography . online, Nisbet majored in professional golf management at Mississippi . State University and had worked as a golf pro at The Country Club of . Birmingham in Alabama and Beech Woods Golf Course in Southfield, . Michigan. It also claims he is 'one of the only Top 50 US Kids Golf Master Teachers in Northern California.'

"The key to living longer is having a waist measurement no bigger than half your height, according to research. Scientists have devised a simple formula which predicts how many years of life someone will lose to obesity. And they claim the rule applies regardless of age, gender or ethnicity. Scroll down for video . Scientists at City University  have found the key to a long life is having a waist no bigger than half your height . It is worked out by measuring around the waist – technically between the lowest rib and hip bone – making sure you do not breathe in. As long as this is half your height or less, you should live to the average life expectancy – which is currently around 81. But for every few inches over, you face losing months or even years of life. For example, an average 30-year-old man who is 5ft 10in tall – or 70 inches – should have a waist size no bigger than 35 inches. A 30-year-old 5ft 4in woman should have a waist size of 32 inches or under. But if the man’s waist size expands to 42 inches – or 60 per cent of his height – it will knock 1.7 years off his life, according to the formula. Likewise if the woman’s waist grows to 38.4 inches she will lose 1.4 years. This may not sound much but it quickly adds up if someone is severely obese. A 30-year-old man of 5ft 10in with a 56-inch waist can expect to lose 20.2 years from his life expectancy. Similarly a woman with a 51-inch waist will die 10.6 years earlier. Scientists have devised a simple formula which predicts how many years of life someone will lose to obesity . The researchers at Cass Business School at City University, London, came up with the calculation after looking at records of more than 300,000 adults spanning 20 years. Dr Margaret Ashwell told the Sunday Times it should be used as a simple health check that anyone can do at home. She added that waist circumference is important because it shows the amount of central fat in the body – which is linked to high cholesterol, diabetes and heart disease. She also believes the waist-to-height ratio is a far more reliable predictor of ill health and obesity than the Body Mass Index (BMI) – which is widely used by doctors. ‘People are living in false hope if they rely on their BMI figure. We have got to measure the right thing,’ she said. This graphic shows how a 30-year-old's life expectancy can decrease by a number of years if their waistline circumference is more than half their height . The BMI compares a person’s weight to their height, and puts around 60 per cent of Britons in the obese or overweight category. But Dr Ashwell added that if the Government were to use waist measurement instead, this would go up to around 69 per cent. Professor Les Mayhew, who was also involved in the study to be published by the Public Library of Science, said: ‘There is now overwhelming evidence that government policy should place greater emphasis on waist-to-height ratio as a screening tool.’ However Dr Rachel Pryke, clinical spokesman on nutrition at the Royal College of GPs, said it was unclear whether ‘worrying people about their weight actually motivates them to make a long-term commitment to lifestyle changes’.","Scientists at City University London say waistline should be half your height .

"A prostitute raped and sexually tortured by the 'crucifixion killer' of Florence has told how he promised to return and kill her. The shocking account mirrors the attack on 26-year-old Andrea Cristina Zamfir whose lifeless body was discovered on Monday, bound with tape to an iron bar in a Crucifixion-like pose. The Romanian immigrant, who was naked except for her gym shoes and socks is thought to be the victim of a serial killer akin to the 'Monster of Florence' who killed 16 people over 30 years ago. Murdered: Andrea Cristina Zamfir, 26, was found naked and bound with tape, beneath a bridge in Ugnano, a village near Florence, Italy. A man has now been arrested on suspicion of murder and rape . Since then prostitutes have been lining up at the police station to help bring the killer to justice. One, a Romanian called Martina, described her terrifying ordeal after being picked up two years ago from the park delle Cascine in Florence where she meets her clients. She told Italian newspaper La Nazione: ‘I was tortured by that maniac. He was like a beast. But not even a beast would be capable of such brutality.’ The man, who called himself Alessandro, arrived in a light coloured small car before taking her to a field. He didn’t initially ask for any special requests, she said. ‘But once we arrived he transformed. He had seemed quiet. But as soon as he got out of the car he became a monster. I ran off but he chased me and caught me. At that point I said to him, ‘I’ll do what you want.’ The scene where the woman's body was found stripped naked and crucified in a village near Florence in Italy . He told her to strip naked. In the car boot there was a wooden pole, some electric cables and tape, she said. ‘He tied me to a pole standing up, my arms crossed in front of my face. He came up from behind took the wooden pole and attacked me. ‘Then he took some pliers and came towards my breasts. I was terrified.’ In that moment she some how found the strength to fight him off. She said: ‘I had a surge of energy, I kicked him you know where. Luckily he stopped and got into his car.’ She later identified the suspect as a short, chubby, balding man in his 50s with a white car, who spoke Italian. He left the girl bound, taking her clothes, bag, money, phone and everything that she owned. But miraculously she managed to free herself after several agonizing hours pulling at the tape with her teeth. Then she ran naked to a nearby house to beg for help. A local police inspector said the woman had a slow and terrible death after being found in the crucifixion position . The woman's body was found under this bridge in the small village of Ugnano near Florence . A year later the monster returned to the park to taunt her, she explained. ‘He said: “So do you like sado-masochism?” When I told him to get lost, and that he was a criminal he shouted: “Next time I’ll kill you.”' The terrified woman said the attack still haunts her. She said: ‘I’m not the only one. Many others have had dealings with him. When I think about it I shudder still.’ Florence’s most senior policeman agreed that the killer was ‘a beast’. Police chief Raffaele Micillo said: 'I'm reluctant to offend animals with this comparison but this person is a beast,' 'We are all working to find the killer, who we suspect of committing a series of rapes as well as murders and attempted murders. I would pay any sum to get this person.' The net could be closing in as police have found matching DNA traces at the scenes of three of his maniacal attacks. In all the cases the killer apparently left traces of saliva on the tape that he used to bind his victims, probably as he used his teeth to break the tape. Carabinieri scientists have found the identical DNA in three cases where the maniac has attacked, tortured and raped prostitutes. The attacks took place in July 2011, March 2013 and 21 February 2014 in the Florence area. In the cases of two other rapes of prostitutes in December 2006 and October 2009 there is no DNA but the accounts of the victim are strikingly similar, police say. The autopsy has shown that the woman died of internal hemorrhage. She died in minutes as her internal wounds caused her to go into traumatic shock, police said. Offices have begun house-to-house inquiries in a bid to track down Ms Zamfir's killer. The victim had a criminal record in Italy for prostitution, and was identified through her fingerprints. Sources in the investigation said evidence shows that the dead woman was sexually abused before she was taped to the iron bar and then abandoned. The allegations are supported by numerous bruises on her arms and back, showing that she tried hard to free herself. Ms Zamfir was found by a cyclist . beneath a motorway flyover at the end of Via del Cimitero after they . spotted her body taped by the wrists to a road barrier, with her head . slumped back. Her clothes and handbag were found half a mile down the road near the Tuscan capital. The 'Monster of Florence', also known as Il Mostro, notoriously killed 16 people around Florence from 1968 to 1985. He used a 22 Beretta gun each time, often then mutilating his female victims, and prayed on couples in lovers' lanes in and around the picturesque Italian city. Despite four local men – Stefano Mele, Pietro Pacciani, Mario Vanni, and Giancarlo Lotti – being arrested, charged, and convicted of the different crimes over the years, it is believed the real perpetrator was never caught. The 'Monster' first struck on August 21, 1968, when he killed lovers Antonio Lo Bianco, 29, and Barbara Locci, 32, with the gun in Signa, a small town to the west of Florence. Locci's son Natalino Mele, six, was asleep in the back seat of the car at the time. On September 15, 1974, teenage sweethearts Pasquale Gentilcore, a 19-year-old barman, and Stefania Pettini, an 18-year-old accountant were shot to death and stabbed in a country lane near Borgo San Lorenzo while having sex in Gentilcore's Fiat 127. Then on June 6, 1981, engaged couple Giovanni Foggi, a 30-year-old warehouseman, and Carmela Di Nuccio, a 21-year-old shop assistant, were shot to death and stabbed near Scandicci, where they both lived. Next, 26-year-old workman Stefano Baldi and his fiance Susanna Cambi, a 24-year-old telephonist, were shot to death and stabbed in a park in the vicinity of Calenzano on October 23, 1981. On June 19, 1982 engaged lovers Paolo Mainardi, a 22-year-old mechanician, and Antonella Migliorini, a 20-year-old dressmaker, were shot to death in Mainardi's car while parked on a country road in Montespertoli. Another car murder occurred on September 9, 1983 when two 24-year-old male German tourists, Horst Wilhelm Meyer and Jens Uwe Rüsch, were shot to death in their Volkswagen Samba Bus, in Galluzzo. On July 29, 1984, sweethearts Claudio Stefanacci, a 21-year-old student, and Pia Gilda Rontini, a 18-year-old barmaid and cheerleader, were shot to death and stabbed in Stefanacci's Fiat Panda parked in a woodland area near Vicchio di Mugello. Finally, on September 7–8, 1985, French lovers on vacation Jean Michel Kraveichvili, a 25-year-old musician, and Nadine Mauriot, a 36-year-old tradeswoman, were murdered. Nadine was shot to death and stabbed while sleeping in their small tent in a woodland area near San Casciano. But Jean Michel was killed a short distance away from the tent while trying to escape. Because they were travelling foreigners nobody reported them missing. This led to the killer posting a piece of Nadine's breast and a taunting note to the state prosecutor, Silvia della Monica, informing her of the murder and setting a challenge to find the victims' bodies. However, Ms Mauriot and Mr Kraveichvili's bodies were found a few hours before the letter arrived on the prosecutor's desk.","Prostitute raped and tortured by 'crucifixion killer' comes forward .

"Amanda Knox can no longer rely on Raffaele Sollecito being her alibi in the Meredith Kercher murder case, with Sollecito now denying she was with him the whole of the night on which the British student was brutally murdered. This change in his defence could potentially incriminate Knox. Sollecito and Knox were originally sentenced to 25 and 28 years in prison, respectively, for the murder of Kercher in Perugia and served four years before being released in 2011. Scroll down for video . Italian Raffaele Sollecito, convicted with former lover Amanda Knox of the grizzly murder of British student Meredith Kercher, arrives with his lawyer Giulia Bongiorno (left) for a press conference on July 1,  in Rome . Change of defense: Sollecito now denies that Amanda Knox was with him for the entire night on which Meredith Kercher was murdered in 2007 . Mismatching points of view: It is not the first time Sollecito has expressed doubts about the holes in Knox’s story . On January 30, an Italian appeals court reconvicted the pair of murdering former roommate Kercher - a ruling the pair are again appealing. Knox and Sollecito have always maintained that they were together the evening of the brutal 2007 murder in Perugia, after which Miss Kercher, 21, was found half naked her throat slit in the cottage she shared with Knox. But Sollecito's lawyer Giulia Bongiorno said that 'for the entire first part of the evening, they were not together. It’s this first part of the evening that’s new [to his defence]'. Sollecito has pointed to phone records that show that Knox was away from his house for part of the evening. In a dramatic change of legal tactics that he announced in a press conference in Rome he has now claimed there are ‘anomalies’ in Knox’s story. Determined: Knox, a University of Washington student, has been in the United States since 2011 and has vowed  the she would never 'willingly' return to Italy to face her fate in court . Brutal: Meredith Kercher was stabbed to death in 2007 . Knox says that she received a text, while at Sollecito’s house, from her boss, telling her not to come to her job at a nightclub that night. But phone records show that the text was received on the road between their houses, something that their retrial judges felt was key in their reconstruction of events. Sollecito's phone and computer records show that he was at home that evening. Sollecito said: ‘I have always believed in the innocence of Amanda. But I have to react to the accusations of the court and to the text message. ‘Either the court has made their umpteenth mistake or she lied to me.’ He added: ‘I was in love with her and we had some very happy moments, but ultimately Amanda was a stranger.' 'There are anomalies in her version of events. Against me there is nothing.' The 'fundamental basis' for the conviction is Knox’s memo to police in which she says she was at the cottage when the murder took place, he said. ‘I believe this was a hallucination, but if the court believes it is true then they have to accept that she did not say I was there. She gave me an alibi. ‘ . It is not the first time Sollecito has expressed his doubts about the holes in Knox’s story. In an interview with Italian television earlier this year, he said Knox had spent the night with him but went back to her place to shower, he said. When she returned, she was 'very agitated,' he said. She told him that it looked like someone had broken in and that there was blood in the bathroom, Sollecito said. But rather than call the police, she showered and returned to his place something he finds odd. ‘Certainly I asked her questions,' he said. 'Why did you take a shower? Why did she spend so much time there?' He didn't get any real answers from her, he said. Knox, a University of Washington student, has been in the United States since 2011. She left Italy right after an earlier appeals court ruling overturned the initial lower court conviction that had led to her imprisonment in Italy. The American, 28, has vowed the she would never 'willingly' return to Italy to face her fate in court. She has said she is hopeful Italian courts will 'once again recognize' her innocence.","Sollecito and Knox reconvicted of Meredith Kercher's murder in January .

"Opera star Andrea Bocelli’s was scammed by conmen after they produced tens of thousands of fake bottles of his own branded wine - and sold it for up to ten times the price. The rip-off versions of Bocelli a Lajatico were sold in Italy and abroad alongside fake bottles of other classic Italian wines, such as Chianti and Brunello. The huge fraud sheds light on the counterfeit wine trade from which criminal gangs in the agribusiness sector reap millions. Opera singer Andrea Bocelli has been the victim of a high-level scam after fraudsters bottled . poor-quality wine and pretended it was the singer's own brand, Bocelli a . Lajatico . Thousands of bottles of wine, including rip-off version of Chianti, were found by police after raids in Tuscany . The bottles - which were falsely marked as Brunello di Montalcino, Chiantis and the opera singer's own brand - were exposed by police in Tuscany, after a series of raids, Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported. The wines were said to be of poor quality but carried the highly-prized DOCG label, meaning guaranteed designation of origin. Investigators trawled wine cellars, shops, supermarkets and bottling factories to undercover the scam. Police in the regions of Lazio, Liguria and Umbria were also involved, the ministry of agriculture said in a statement. The blind opera star owns a family winery near Pisa with his brother Alberto, which produces about 300 bottles a year. Agriculture Minister Maurizio Martina praised the work of police and described the wine trade as 'one of the main symbols' of Italy’s agricultural heritage. He said: 'We must continue to work with maximum attention to defend our production from all illegality, which damages the ‘Made in Italy’ [brand].'

"As fearsome killers, Mafia members do not have the cuddliest of reputations. But actually they are more sensitive, family-orientated and selfless than other murderers, research has found. A study of inmates in a prison in the home of the Mafia, Sicily, showed that unlike other violent prisoners, criminals with links to the mob were not psychopathic. James Gandoldfini (left) played a mafioso on The Sopranos who balanced his love for his family with his callousness as a don; Real-life mafioso Al Capone (right) was eventually sent to prison for tax evasion . The Italian researchers compared 30 Mafiosi with 39 non-Mafia criminals. They found that the Mafiosi tended to compartmentalise their lives and feelings: on the one hand, their vicious criminal activities and on the other, their warm emotions towards relatives and friends. The research, published in the magazine Discover, echoes the character of Tony Soprano. In hit US mob show The Sopranos viewers saw him struggle to balance the love for his family with his criminal pursuits. Around half of the mafiosi questioned were serving time for violent offences, one quarter were murderers and the rest were convicted of crimes such as kidnapping, trafficking drugs and fraud. Professor Adriano Schimmenti, who led the study said: 'Our findings bring new hope for re-socialisation of convicted Mafia members, because they showed significant antisocial traits but they maintained a capacity for emotional connection and greater likelihood of engaging with training and re-socialisation programmes than other imprisoned offenders in Italy. Further, during the interviews, they often expressed concerns for their children and their families, and they had never ceased to write and call them. The Sopranos featuring James Gandolfini (right) and Michael Imperioli . 'Such expressions of attachment were less apparent among the comparison men.' They were also less likely to have addiction problems than other prisoners, he said. ‘Mafia members are required to appear reliable, maintain power and adhere to the internal representations and principles of their organisation, and such skills tend to be impaired by substance use. 'It may be that substance misusers would be less likely to be selected for Mafia membership (as they would be viewed as liabilities), and if selected by chance, their involvement would be short lived.’ Sicilty: Beautiful but home to some of the world's deadliest killers but at least they are nice to their families . The Italian researchers studied 30 mafiosi in a prison in Palermo, Sicily and compared them with 39 criminals convicted for other crimes. The subjects were psychologically analysed using an assessment system called the Hare Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R) which measures psychotic characteristics. Those who receive a score over 30 are considered a psychopath- none of the Mafia members scored over 30 in the researchers' test.","Mafioso nice to family and friends unlike non-'made' killers .

"Despite her hot-blooded ways, she is thought of as one of literature’s very British characters.And she has certainly been portrayed on TV as an English rose.But Lady Chatterley was in fact Italian, a new book claims – or at least the character that inspired her was . Rina Secker and DH Lawrence are pictured left at Spotorno in Italy in 1926. She is pictured right at a ball in Alassio, Italy in 1931. A book suggests she may have been the inspiration for the character Lady Chatterley . Rina Secker painted by the Russian-Dutch society portrait painter Han Harloff. The image appears in the new book, Lady Chatterley's Villa . DH . Lawrence’s provocative Connie, who beds her aristocratic husband’s . gamekeeper, was based on his publisher’s Italian wife, according to . Richard Owen in his book Lady Chatterley’s Villa. Lawrence had . already used Rina Secker, as the muse for Juliet in his short story Sun, . in which a young woman holidaying alone in Italy experiences erotic . fantasies about a local peasant farmer. But Owen says that Lawrence’s . German wife Frieda caused a stir when she declared at a London party: . ‘Rina my dear, Lady Chatterley is you.’ DH Lawrence, pictured, may have been inspired for his character Lady Chatterley, by his publisher's Italian wife, according to a new account of the author's travels, Lady Chatterley's Villa . She even proposed that Mrs . Secker, wife of publisher Martin Secker, should play Lady Chatterley in . the movie version – a role taken on TV in 1993 by Joely Richardson and . on film in 1981 by Sylvia Kristel. Mrs Secker, when Lawrence knew . her, was an attractive and flirtatious young mother who, like Connie, . suffered from mood swings and discontentment and was growing . increasingly estranged from her husband. For long periods of the . Seckers’ marriage, she lived apart from him on the Italian Riviera and . was rumoured to be having several affairs, including one with her . driver. Two years before Lady Chatterley’s Lover was published, she . spent six months with Lawrence and Frieda in Spotorno, where her father . owned a hotel, as the writer recovered from tuberculosis. Lawrence was . inspired by her, Owen claims, perceiving the growing unhappiness in her . marriage and the reason for it. While suffering from nervous exhaustion, . involving headaches, anxiety attacks and depression, says Owen, the . publisher’s wife was also ‘vibrant, observant, mischievous, flirtatious . and coquettishly aware of her charms’. He adds: ‘This is strikingly . similar to Lawrence’s description of the “feminine” and “womanly” Connie . Chatterley, with the “growing restlessness” and sense of “disconnexion” which drives her into the arms of gamekeeper Mellors.’ Film: Sylvia Krisel as Connie in the 1981 silver screen version . Onscreen: Joely Richardson as Lady Chatterley and Sean Bean as Mellors from a 1993 TV adaptation . Mrs Secker’s relationship with her husband is reflected in Connie’s feelings about her husband Sir Clifford, Owen says. He . told the Daily Mail: ‘Lawrence was very perceptive and used people he . met all the time in his fiction. There is no evidence that he used Rina . for the sex scenes in Lady Chatterley but her character contributed to . it.’ As the book acknowledges, Lawrence also drew inspiration from . his wife’s affair with a handsome Italian officer named Angelo Ravagli, . whom they met through Mrs Secker.

"A mob of 50 furious Italians stormed a Roma camp outside Naples after a girl suffered an alleged attempted rape by two gypsies. Dozens of Neapolitans laid siege to the camp, pelting residents with rocks before being restrained by the police. The following day dozens of the inhabitants of the Poggioreale site, on the eastern outskirts of Naples, decamped. A Roma gypsy camp just outside Naples was attacked after a young Italian girl claimed that she had been attacked by two members of the community . The camp was just on the outskirts of the city of Naples, the third largest city in Italy - in 2010, eighteen mafia suspects were arrested for a suspected arson attack on the camp . Entire families fled the site in vans, apparently fearing further attacks. A 16-year old Italian girl had returned home in a state of agitation, complaining of the alleged attack by two Roma, around 9pm on Tuesday night. She was taken to hospital in a state of shock. Relatives of the girl headed for the camp with the intention of ‘punishing’ the perpetrators, before exchanging blows with Roma, leaving them injured. The Roma Gypsy camp just outside of Naples had already come under fire from critics because of claims that it was unhygienic . But hours later they returned, flanked by the vigilante mob, threatening fires and launching rocks at the campsite. The site's 250 inhabitants were forced to put up road blocks to defend themselves, and the police eventually managed to restore order. The camp, which has been in that location for four years has already been the focus of protests by locals because of poor hygiene conditions. In 2010 police arrested 18 mafia suspects over an arson attack on the encampment. In January the mayor ordered the camp's removal. Municipal leader Armando Coppola said the girl had suffered an attempted rape but had managed to escape. He added: 'Residents have already had to put up with thefts and obscene acts by the gypsies who are inclined to urinate in the street. 'But this episode triggered a violent reaction. 'I have requested the council to order the immediate eviction of the camp. 'Otherwise the justifiable exasperation of the citizens of Poggioreale will no longer be controllable.'","Dozens of people from Naples laid siege to camp throwing rocks at residents .

"Her enigmatic smile has fascinated and baffled experts for centuries. But now an amateur art historian claims to have solved the mystery of the Mona Lisa - she was a feminist, who believed that women should be allowed to become priests. More than 500 years after after Leonardo da Vinci’s masterpiece, U.S. academic William Varvel has argued that the artist’s muse was a 16th-century activist who favoured a greater role for women in the Catholic Church. Amateur art historian William Varvel has claimed that the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa was a feminist . It is generally agreed that the model for the Mona Lisa was Florentine noblewoman, Lisa de Giocondo, whose wealthy husband, a cloth and silk merchant, commissioned the portrait. The painting is called 'La Gioconda' in Italian. In a newly published book, ‘The Lady Speaks: Uncovering the Secrets of the Mona Lisa’, the academic wrote: ‘La Gioconda could be a grand statement for women's rights.’ During the course of his career, da Vinci had painted every verse of the final chapter of the Old Testament's book of Zechariah, which anticipates the rise of an ideal and equal society, Mr Varvel explains in the 180-page book. He did so, Mr Varvel insists, ‘in order to state that women's rights to the priesthood should be recognised.’ For da Vinci, the idea of the ideal society ‘was based upon a universal recognition of both men and women of the laity to have recognised rights of the priesthood of Jesus Christ,’ Mr Varvel said. He added: 'This perception is the secret that her smile reflects.' Academic William Varvel (left) has written a book about Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. In it he says that the Mona Lisa, also known as La Gioconda, 'could be a grand statement for women's rights' Some of the 40 symbols placed into the background, middle ground and foreground of the painting would appear to back up his theory, Mr Varvel claims. Calvary, the place where Jesus was crucified, rises from behind the Mona Lisa's right shoulder, while the Mount of Olives, from where he ascended to heaven, is on the other side. And the folds on the arms of the woman's robe suggest a yoke - a reference to women's oppression, he said. Other historians have claimed that the model was smiling because she had recently given birth. Yet Mr Varvel, a former mathematics professor from Texas, has in fact never seen the Mona Lisa up close. He said: 'I'm not going to fight the crowd and see La Gioconda. 'If I go to Paris, the Louvre is going to give me a private showing - and if they don't, I won't go.'","Amateur art historian William Varvel has claimed that Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa was a feminist .

"On trial: Francesco Schettino, captain of the cruise ship Concordia, tried to orchestrate a cover up in which the company would blame the tragic shipwreck on a power cut, a court in Italy has heard . The captain of the cruise ship Concordia tried to orchestrate a cover up in which the company would blame the tragic shipwreck on a power cut, a court in Italy has heard. Captain Francesco Schettino was in command of the giant cruise liner when it hit rocks and sank off the coast of Tuscany in January 2012, killing 32 people. The 52-year-old, who allegedly caused the crash by ordering an ill fated ‘salute’ to the island of Giglio, is currently on trial for mass manslaughter and abandoning ship. Giving evidence at the court in Grosseto, Tuscany, head of the crisis unit Roberto Ferrarini said that the former captain asked him to help cover his tracks, by telling the authorities that a power outage had caused the collision. Emergency manager Ferrarini said: ‘Schettino asked me to tell the maritime authorities that the collision was down to a blackout on the ship. But I strongly objected. ‘That was a different false account compared to what he had said before, namely, that he had hit a rock which caused the ship to flood.‘I remember I got quite angry-and I shared that reaction with my colleagues.' Ferrarini, a key witness, was also to stand trial for his part in the disaster but through a plea bargain negotiated a two year two month suspended sentence before proceedings began.

"He has been prime minister of Italy three times. But now Silvio Berlusconi has gone one better, winning an Oscar - Italy’s first Academy award in 15 years. The billionaire mogul’s Mediaset film company produced The Great Beauty, which picked up the coveted gong for best foreign language film in Sunday night’s awards.

Talented: The Great Beauty director Paolo Sorrentino clutching his Oscar after the ceremony . Honour: Actor Toni Servillo (left), who stars in The Great Beauty, director  Sorrentino (centre) and producer Nicola Giuliano accept the Best Foreign Language Film award on Sunday . Director Paolo Sorrentino credited everyone from Diego Maradona to legendary director Martin Scorsese for his victory with the film which reveals the empty worlds of decadent high society in Rome. But Berlusconi was unable to attend the Oscars ceremony personally, due to a travel ban imposed last year after a conviction for fraud. However he appears at pains make sure his contribution to La Grande Belleza receives the recognition it deserves. An editorial in the Berlusconi family newspaper Il Giornale crowed: ‘Silvio Berlusconi, founder and major shareholder in Mediaset, believed in Sorrentino’s project, produced and distributed the film.’ Berlusconi encouraged ambition in the making of the film and had no fear of investing his own money, it said. ‘He understood that cinema is a resource that had contributed to Italy’s successes, ’ it added. Left wing politicians who are trying to take the credit for Italy's victory are missing the point - the film is a criticism of their society, 'empty and hypocritical'.

"Parish priest: Pope Francis enjoys surprising his followers with phone calls to keep himself grounded . A widow ‘adopted’ by Pope Francis after losing two of her four children has told how he moves her to tears every time he calls her. The pontiff revealed in an interview that makes monthly phone calls to a grieving woman. As pope he has less contact with ordinary people and it gives him satisfaction to ‘act the role of parish priest’, he explained. Rosalba Ferri, 77, from Pesaro, Italy, lost her son Andrea Ferri when he was hit by six bullets, during a robbery at the petrol station where he worked, in June last year. Mrs Ferri had already had a son die many years before when he was a baby. She now cares for one son with Downs Syndrome and another who is in a wheelchair following a car accident. The heartbroken grandmother said that the unexpected phone calls move her to tears. She told Italian newspaper La Nazione: ‘He always surprises me. He says ‘Ciao Rosalba, it’s Pope Francis’. And I never know what to say. During the call I always end up crying. She added: ‘He asks me how I am and I say “Terrible: I miss Andrea.” He understands me. He says that a mother should never have to bury their child and he says that he thinks of me often.’ The mother-of–four, who goes to her son’s grave every week to talk to him, added: ‘We have never had such a good pope. He is a humble person. He really cares for those in need.’ Mrs Ferri says that she does not tell many people outside the family about the attentive phone calls: . She said: ‘I told the parish priest Father Mario and he said, “But the Pope never calls me!” And he said he will go with me to Rome to meet the Pope.’ Widow Rosalba Ferri, 77, said: 'I never know what to say. During the call I always end up crying' Francis apparently enjoys surprising those who write to him with unexpected phone calls. On New Year’s day he called a group of nuns in Spain and left a voicemail. Last year he called a pregnant Italian woman whose married boyfriend had unsuccessfully pressured her to have an abortion. The pope offered to personally baptise the baby when it is born.","Rosalba Ferri, 77, from Pesaro, Italy, had one son die at hands of robbers .

"An Italian woman who underwent fertility treatment has become pregnant with the twins of another couple, after their embryos got mixed up. The devastating error was only discovered when the woman was three months pregnant. The couples were among four prospective parents receiving fertility treatment at the same specialist unit of a Rome hospital on the same day last December. An Italian mother-to-be is carrying another woman's twins after an IVF mix-up meant the wrong embryos were implanted during her treatment . The genetic mother of the twins also became pregnant after the medical intervention, but miscarried early on. Legally she and her partner have no claim to the unborn children, as Italian law specifies that the mother is the woman who gives birth to the baby. The pregnant woman, who has not been named, has decided to take the pregnancy to term, her lawyer told Italian newspaper La Repubblica. ‘I had a moment of human rejection when I knew that they were not mine, or rather ours, that the embryos that I was carrying were of another woman, but then we decided that the pregnancy had to continue, our values are these,’ said the woman according to her lawyer, Michele Ambrosini. ‘These children live inside me. I heard them beat on my heart. They grow and are healthy,’ the woman told the lawyer. ‘How can I decide the fate of two creatures so long-awaited?’ Health Minister Beatrice Lorenzin has launched an investigation into the catastrophic error. The woman has decided to continue with the pregnancy and will be legally entitled to keep the babies when they are born because Italian law defines the mother as the person who gives birth to the baby (file picture) She said: ‘The national standards on assisted fertilisation, which are based on European directives, are very rigorous, and if applied correctly, guarantee the traceability of all biological material used in the reproduction process.’ The local health authority in Rome said it only became aware there was a problem of ‘genetic incompatibility’ between the parents and the embryos on March 27th. It said it has halted all embryo implantations at the clinic until further notice.","The unnamed woman had IVF treatment in Rome in December .

"Jail-house stripes look like last season’s trend as fashion designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana are set to be acquitted of tax fraud, after an Italian prosecutor declared them innocent. The world famous design duo were sentenced to one year and eight months in jail last year after being convicted of evading taxes on almost one billion euros. The two founders of the iconic fashion house were also ordered to pay compensation to Italy's tax authorities. Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce were found guilty of tax evasion and sentenced to jail, but may now walk free after a prosecutor said they were innocent . Milan prosecutors had told the court that the creators of the . world-famous Dolce & Gabbana brand, with six others, evaded taxes . for several years after setting up a holding company in Luxembourg . called Gado. 'Gado was an artificial construction with the specific function of obtaining tax benefits,' prosecutors said. But . in a dramatic turnaround today an appeal court heard that the . designers had 'paid their taxes' and that the holding company was 'a . legal operation'. The news will come as a relief for fans after the designers said it could go bankrupt if the fine was imposed . At the time of the convictions last year the fashion house closed their Milan store in protest . Prosecutor Gaetano Santamaria Amato today called for the acquittal of all the accused saying . that 'the case is groundless'. Mr Santamaria Amato told the court that the financial move outside Italy was 'economically justifiable'. He . explained: ‘You chose Luxembourg because the stock exchange is the . most vibrant in Europe, because its tax system attracts capital and also . because it has many bilateral treaties with other states that regulate . the principle of double taxation. ‘ .

"Legend: Lollobrigida was once dubbed 'the most beautiful woman in the world' Sixties screen goddess Gina Lollobrigida is squaring up for a fresh battle over her vast fortune - this time with her son. Only son and heir Milko Skofic Jr wants to wrest control of her estate from the actress, 86, amid fears that she is in the grip of several young male admirers. A year ago, the Italian actress, once dubbed 'The world’s most beautiful woman', was forced to take legal action against her ex-toyboy lover, whom she accused of marrying her by proxy, to get his hands on her riches. The screen siren owns a series of properties in Italy and in Monte Carlo and has an estimated £30million fortune. Her jewels alone were worth a great deal - she auctioned them off for charity last year and they fetched £3.2million. Mr Skofic reportedly wants the estate to be managed by a court-appointed administrator who would oversee the investments and purchases of the star and who acted with Humphrey Bogart, Burt Lancaster and Sean Connery in her heyday. Mr Skofic, the son of a Yugoslav doctor whom Miss Lollobrigida divorced in 1971, told Italian newspaper Il Messaggero: ‘My mother needs an administrator - I fear she may no longer be capable of handling her affairs by herself.’ The lifestyle of his mother recently seen in the company of a 'very young manager,' had given Mr Skofic reason for concern, the newspaper reported. A court will rule on the request for an administrator in April. Miss Lollobrigida opposes the move saying she is ‘perfectly capable in myself’. She told the newspaper: ‘I am still travelling non-stop, all over the world. I flit back and forth to Monte Carlo all the time'. The screen diva, known for her rivalry with fellow Italian Sophia Loren, made headlines the world over last year when she claimed that her former boyfriend paid an impersonator to stand in for her at a proxy wedding in Spain in 2010. Sham wedding? Lollobrigida pictured with Spaniard Javier Rigau y Rafols, who she claimed married an imposter version of her . Miss Lollobrigida first met Spanish businessman Javier Rigau y Rafols, 43 years her junior, at a party in Monte Carlo in the 1980s. The couple became companions and planned to marry in 2006 but Miss Lollobrigida changed her mind before the ceremony could take place. The former sex symbol said she had no knowledge of her 2010 wedding to Mr Rafols and would never have agreed to it. She only discovered it by chance on the internet with the help of her young male manager, Andrea Piazzolla. She told the Daily Mail last year: 'I knew nothing about this until I did some research on the internet. He invented a false document to carry out this wedding and now he will pay. I will not rest until he has been brought to justice. He is nothing but a vulture, circling me, sniffing my blood. He married me and was waiting for me to die so he could inherit my possessions.' But Rafols claimed the marriage was ‘completely legitimate,’ and witnessed by eight people. Miss Lollobrigida's agent, Paola Comin, told the Daily Mail that the actress was abroad and unavailable for comment. She added: 'She is certainly mentally present and has no need of a court appointed administrator.' Sour: The pair were engaged in 2006, but Rigau backed out at the last minute declaring he could not handle the media spotlight .

"A state of emergency was declared in Sardinia yesterday after a cyclone left at least 18 people dead and thousands homeless. Streets vanished under floodwater and bridges collapsed as rivers burst their banks when the equivalent of six months of rain, almost 20in, fell on the island in less than 24 hours. Gianni Giovannelli, the mayor of the north-eastern town of Olbia, where 13 of the victims died, described Cyclone Cleopatra as ‘an apocalyptic storm’. In the town of Arzachena nearby, four . members of the same family, including a 16-year-old girl, were drowned . when their basement flat was submerged in a flood. Other children were among the dead as torrential rain lashed the island. 'State of emergency': A truck and a bus are stranded by flood waters in a tunnel near Olbia, Sardinia.

Environment . minister Andrea Orlandi estimated that around 2,700 people have been . displaced after their homes were submerged by water and mud. Some spent the night in makeshift shelters in school gymnasiums, while others stayed with relatives. Many . Sardinians are questioning why government departments, including the . Civil Protection Agency, did not issue warnings before the cyclone . struck on Monday night. However, . agency head Franco Gabrielli defended the warning system, saying it . worked but that nothing could predict such ‘an exceptional event’. Attempts: A truck tries to drive through a flooded street close to Torpe near Nuoro, Sardinia while rain continues to fall . Rubbish: Piles of debris lie in a flooded street in the town of Olbia.

Italian government has pledged £17million to tackle the immediate . emergency, which was described by the prime minister, Enrico Letta, as . ‘a national tragedy’. He said: ‘At the moment the priority is saving lives.’ However, the rescue operation last night was hampered by renewed storms and the fact that many roads have been destroyed. The rainfall caused many rivers to burst their banks, sweeping away cars and flooding homes across the island. Prime Minister Enrico Letta said today, 'This is a national tragedy.' Bad weather is forecast to continue today. The . mayor of Olbia, the northeastern . Sardinian town that was among the worst-affected areas, said the sudden . flooding had burst 'like a bomb'. He added that the same amount of water . fell in 90 minutes that usually falls in the city of Milan in six . months. Mayor . Gianni Giovannelli said houses across the area had been left . half-submerged by the floods and rescuers were still searching for . possible victims.

'We've just found a dead child we had been searching all night for,' he told SkyTG24 television. Residents told of narrow escapes as sudden floods of water surged into their houses. 'We . managed to open the door with all this water inside, it was just . devastating. The kids didn't have anything, they were naked, naked, they . managed to get out by the back stairs,' Olbia resident Francesco . Brandano said. 'Everything is wet, everything needs to be thrown . away. Everything is gone, documents, everything. We haven't got anything . left.' The declaration of a . state of emergency will mean resources will reach devastated areas more . quickly, with swathes of the island under muddy flood waters that . covered cars and swamped houses, displacing 2,700 according to . authorities. The government set aside 20 million euros in immediate emergency funds to help the rescue and clean-up work. The regional government of Sardinia separately approved 5 million euros in aid funds. Underwater: A street near Nuoro, Sardinia, is completely flooded following the 90-minute torrential downpour . Devastation: Due to extreme rainfall, a bridge collapsed, pictured, near Oliena, Sardinia. Bad weather was predicted to continue throughout Tuesday .

'The . hotels in Olbia are full of people who have had to escape, but there . are thousands who have damage to their homes.' The disaster raised questions about how well prepared Italy's cash-strapped local governments, under increasing financial pressure after more than two years or recession, are to deal with sudden emergencies. 'We're facing an exceptional event here which has put our system of territorial planning and management into crisis,' said Antonello Frau, deputy head of the island's geological service. 'We really have to assess how we manage these situations, which are becoming more frequent.' Scale: The image shows the entrance to a tunnel completely flooded following a heavy storm, near Nuoro, Sardinia, and two large vehicle left stranded inside . Rainfall: A woman wades through her flooded garden last night - with floodwater well above knee-level . Flooding and landslides have been common in Italy, dominated in many areas by rugged mountain ranges. However Legambiente, Italy's main environmental group, said the disaster showed there was an urgent need to step up measures to handle floods and other disasters, a call backed by the national geological council. It said more than 6 million Italians faced a potential risk from flooding but it said the risk had been made worse by reckless building, particularly in coastal areas. 'This is not just the fault of climate change' the association's president, Gian Vito Graziano, said in a statement.

"The Pope is so popular these days that now he even has his own magazine. Called Il Mio Papa - or My Pope - the glossy magazine will each Wednesday include a free pull-out poster with one of Francis' more memorable quotes from the previous seven days. It is not the first time that the Pope has donned the front cover of a magazine, having recently featured in Rolling Stone and Time magazine. Man of the moment: So popular is the new Pope that a new weekly magazine devoted to him has been launched costing 41 pence an issue . The Mondadori publishing house, which lists the popular celebrity gossip rag Chi among its titles, is the publisher behind the new launch entirely devoted to the weekly doings, sayings, gestures and activities of the 265th Successor of Peter. Mondadori is part of ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi's media empire and is headed by his daughter, Marina Berlusconi. It is being priced at 41 pence and confirms just how popular the new Pope has become. Editor Aldo Vitali said Pope Francis' election a year ago has generated new interest in the papacy, and moral and ethical themes that will be highlighted in the publication. Iconic: Pope Francis graced the cover of Rolling Stone in February showing just how famous throughout the world he has become . And as part of the Pope's new campaign to make the Catholic church more accessible officials have also announced that the lavish gardens of Castel Gandolfo, the refuge of popes since the 16th century, will from next week to be open to all. Vatican museum director Antonio Paolucci said: 'It took a man like Francis to open the grounds to all.' The gardens are a place ‘where the splendour of art and the glory of nature combine in an admirable balance,’ he added. The sumptuous property covers 55 hectares (135 acres), a greater area that the Vatican City itself, and another world from the humble priests’ guestroom occupied by Francis in the Holy See. The Pope never moved into the grand papal apartments claiming they were too large for him. The castle boasts breathtaking views over Lake Gandolfo, real name Lago Albano, as well as ornamental gardens, its own vegetable garden and a flock of chickens. The villa and gardens have been owned by the Holy See since 1596, and are traditionally the refuge of the popes from the summer heat in the city. During his reign, Pope John Paul II ordered that a spectacular pool be put in. Last summer the gardens stood empty as Francis refused to take holiday. After a trip to Brazil for World Youth Day the Pope had remained largely in Rome to the disappointment of villagers looking forward to welcoming him. The visit may be out of reach for many pilgrims, however, with guided tours costing €26. Divine: The gardens at Castel Gandolfo will be opened to the general public next week . Luxury: The gardens have been a refuge of popes since the 16th century . Pope . Francis has quickly become one of the most admired Catholic church . leaders in both religious and secular communities.

"Millionaire racing driver Eddie Irvine has been sentenced to six months in prison for a nightclub brawl in Milan over a woman. Former Formula One legend Irvine, 48, pulled a glass on the son of the former mayor of Milan, and left him with visible injuries over his eye, the court ruled. He was found guilty of assault and battery. The target of his attack, Gabriele Moratti, a renowned playboy, was also found guilty for assault and battery, having launched a hail of punches at Irvine, and was also handed a sentence of six months. Under the Italian justice system both are unlikely to ever see the inside of a jail cell as they are automatically entitled to two appeals. In any case the statute of limitations on the crimes expires in 2015, after which the case will be dropped, unless all appeals have been heard. Punched: Millionaire racing driver Eddie Irvine has been sentenced to . six months in prison for a nightclub brawl in Milan with Gabriele Moratti, the son of a former mayor of the Italian city . The quarrel began over a text message sent by the former Ferrari driver to an ex girlfriend of Moratti, named Giorgia, witnesses told the court in Milan. When Moratti entered the VIP area of Milan’s Hollywood nightclub, and came across eternal bachelor Irvine talking to the girl he had recently broken up with, he attacked him, punching him three times, a lawyer for Irvine told the court. The Formula One champion, who now runs a property company and a shipping business, claimed he was hit repeatedly from behind by Mr Moratti causing him to black out. Giving evidence at an earlier hearing, the multi-millionaire racing driver said he believed Moratti ‘was jealous because I sometimes took his ex girlfriend out. He told the court: ‘I had arrived at the club at about midnight and sat at a table in the VIP area. I was drinking a vodka lemonade and while I was sitting on the sofa talking to Giorgia I was struck with two or three punches by Moratti. I lost my balance and I fell. Someone tried to stop Moratti. I didn’t look back because I was afraid he would hit me in the face.’ Following the brawl, Irvine received . threatening phone calls from one of Moratti’s associates in his Milan . hotel room, he told the court. He said he was left with damage to his ear which prevented him from diving which he had always done easily before the fight. Star: The former Ferrari driver and Formula One champion now runs a property company and shipping business . History: Irvine, left, celebrating with Ferrari engineer Jean Todot, center, and Michael Schumacher, right, after the Argentine Grand Prix in 1998 . After the brawl, both men pressed charges against each other for 'assault and battery'. Moratti denied starting the fight and claimed that Irvine was drunk. Irvine was not in court for the sentence but his lawyer confirmed that the racing star plans to lodge an appeal. Moratti . was present in court. After the sentence, judge Marco Formentin asked . the public prosecutor to investigate possible perjury and intimidation . by all the witnesses for the Moratti defence team,. which included a waiter and . his bodyguard. Celebrations: Eddie Irvine raises his trophy after taking the third place in the 2002 Italian Grand Prix . The unexpected addition by the judge led Irvine’s lawyer Marco Baroncini to declare the outcome ‘a partial victory’ for Irvine. For Moratti it was not his first brush with the law. In April of last year, he was fined €49,000 after falling foul of planning regulations, when he converted a warehouse in the Milanese suburbs into his personal Batman cave. Irvine, nicknamed Fast Eddie, was arrested in London in 2006 for speeding on a scooter in Hyde Park, without a licence or insurance. The jet set sportsman was a Formula One driver from 1993 to 2001, driving for the Jordan, Ferrari and Jaguar teams. The Northern Irish father-of-one, who has a home in Milan as well as properties in Dublin,  Miami and New York, has said that driving for Italian team Ferrari was ‘the best thing that ever happened to him.’ After his stint at the team he is regarded as a national hero in Italy and says he is set up with free Italian food for life. No restaurant will allow him to pay a bill. Irvine, revealed: 'I still find it astonishing how the Italians react to anyone who has ever driven for Ferrari. 'The moment you sign a deal with the team you aren't just another driver, you become part-Italian — no matter what your nationality. You are given the keys to the country.' The Irish driver has an estimated fortune of 90million Euros, though at one time it was said to be as much as Euro200million.

"Italian police have deciphered a mysterious document written in a secret code to reveal that it is a mafia initiation rite. The encrypted pages were entirely covered in letters resembling Cyrillic, Arabic and ancient Chinese characters. Investigators came across the document during a raid on the home of a murder suspect in Rome. The document described the ‘so-called baptism’ into the ‘Ndrangheta mafia, Italy’s richest and most ruthless organised crime clan which is based in Calabria. Secrets revealed: Italian police have deciphered a mysterious document written in a code to reveal that it is an initiation rite into the 'Ndrangheta mafia which is based in Calabria (above) The 'Ndrangheta was thrown into the spotlight recently after it was found that the Grillo sisters, Nigella Lawson’s former personal assistants hailed from a Ndrangheta family. During the secret ceremony the recruit must use a knife to cut his skin before swearing a solemn oath of 'blood and honour'. The initiate drinks his blood and swears 'eternal allegiance to the honoured society' promising to respect the rules of the clan, disown mother, father, brothers and sisters and settle all disputes cent for cent.’ The document lays down precise rules for the initiation rite 'For the baptism, five people are needed – no more and no less,' it said. The oath must be recited three times as the number is considered powerful in Ndranghta tradition. Renowned: The 'Ndrangheta was thrown into the spotlight recently after it was found that the Grillo sisters (above), Nigella Lawson's former personal assistants hailed from a Ndrangheta family . The ceremony should be carried out in a place that is consecrated by those present before with the process completed in reverse afterwards. The three-page, hand-written document is steeped in quasi-religious superstition. One section reads ‘How should you recognise a man of honour? With a gold star on his forehead, a knight's cross on his chest and a gold palm in his hand. 'And how will you recognise these fine objects that you cannot see? Because he wears them in his flesh, skin and bone.’ The 21-letter enigma was cracked by two police officers with an interest in codes and puzzle-solving. They were initially flummoxed but a breakthrough came when they recognised the symbol that represented the letter C, which allowed them to gradually replace the other symbols with letters.

"The former stepson of a man accused of sneaking into the White House says the Iraq war veteran owns 'plenty of firepower' that he could have brought with him if he meant any harm. Omar Gonzalez, 42, is expected to appear in court Monday to face charges of unlawfully entering a restricted building or grounds while carrying a deadly or dangerous weapon — in this case, a three-and-a-half-inch folding knife. However, Jerry Murphy said Sunday that his former stepfather never goes anywhere without his knife and he's sure Gonzalez didn't intend to hurt anyone. Gonzalez was arrested by the Secret Service on Friday after agents claimed he made a dash for the presidential residence while carrying the knife. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This is the first picture of Omar Gonzalez, who was arrested by the Secret Service on Friday after he jumped the White House fence and somehow made it all the way to the Executive Mansion . Easy as pie: An intruder (left) simply hopped the White House fence and somehow made it all the way to the Executive Mansion before the Secret Service was able to stop him. A security guard (right) watched incredulously as the man ran in from the street to President Obama's home . Arrested: Kevin Carr, 19 of New Jersey, was arrested after he allegedly refused to leave a restricted area near the White House. A bomb squad was deployed to check his car in the second security scare at the White House in as many days . Gonzalez —  who is thought to have served 18 years . in the military, including three tours in Iraq — told . Secret Service agents he was convinced 'the atmosphere was collapsing' and that he needed to warn the President. At a hearing late Saturday afternoon in D.C. Superior Court, the assistant public defender representing Gonzalez said Gonzalez had no convictions or arrest warrants and had tested negative Saturday for drug use, according to The Washington Post. 'This is someone who has provided service to his country and shown commitment in his life,' said the lawyer, Margarita O'Donnell, as she tried unsuccessfully to get Gonzalez released. The Army said Gonzalez enlisted in July 1997 and was assigned to the 10th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, at Fort Hood, Texas. At the time, he listed his home as Puerto Rico. Weapon? Gonzalez was allegedly carrying this model of blade - the three-and-a-half-inch Spyderco VG-10 folding knife . He was discharged in September 2003 after completing his service obligation. Gonzalez enlisted a second time, in July 2005, and served until his retirement in late 2012. During this period, he was assigned to the 1st Squadron, 14th Cavalry Regiment, at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state, and the 4th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division at Ford Hood. Gonzalez served in Iraq from October 2006 to January 2008, according to the Army. An unidentified family member said: 'His job was running patrols in Baghdad when his Humvee was hit.' He added, 'A portion of his foot was amputated - and the evidence is the limp you see in the video of him running across the White House lawn.' A police affidavit, seen by ABC News, said Gonzalez had a Spyderco VG-10 black folding knife in the front pocket of his pants when he was arrested. In the wake of his attempt on the White House, the Secret Service announced new, tougher security. On alert: An explosive technician in a bomb suit approaches a vehicle at the White House today . The Secret Service was criticized for not apprehending Gonzalez sooner, and admitted themselves their performance was 'not acceptable,' leading to new measures being put in place. President Obama and his family were not in the White House at the time, but had left just moments before by helicopter. On Saturday, a second man — . Kevin Carr of Shamong, New Jersey — was apprehended trying to get inside, less than 24 hours after Gonzalez's alleged dash.

Carr, who is either 18 or 19, was arrested and charged with unlawful entry. In . the wake of criticism over their handling of White House security — . particularly after the first intruder got so close — the agency pledged . to redouble their efforts. In a statement, Secret Service officials said: 'The challenge of securing the White House . complex from security threats is ever present. 'Although last night the . officers showed tremendous restraint and discipline in dealing with this . subject, the location of Gonzalez’s arrest is not acceptable. 'In . addition to the criminal investigation of Gonzalez by the Secret . Service’s Washington Field Office, Director Julia Pierson immediately . ordered the Secret Service’s Office of Professional Responsibility to . conduct a comprehensive after action review of the incident.' Uniformed Secret Service officers walk Saturday along the fence that an intruder hopped to get into the White House a day earlier . Uniformed Secret Service officers do a security sweep along the lawn on the North side of the White House on Saturday . The . statement continued: 'In the interim, Director Pierson has ordered the . immediate enhancement of officer patrols and surveillance capabilities . along the Pennsylvania Avenue fence line around the White House complex. These measures went into effect last night.' President Obama has backed the agency. A White House spokesman said: 'The president has full confidence in the Secret Service and is grateful to the men and women who day in and day out protect himself, his family and the White House.' The spokesman did not directly address the issue of the second intruder. Evacuation: A Secret Service guard gives directions during the White House evacuation . For . the Secret Service, the breaches were a devastating episode that prompted . fresh questions about the storied agency and its ability to protect the . president. The . Republican Party's Jason Chaffetz, who chairs the House of . Representatives' subpanel on national security oversight, called it . 'totally unacceptable' but said the incident was just one of a string of . security failings on the Secret Service's watch. 'Unfortunately, . they are failing to do their job,' Chaffetz said. 'These are good men . and women, but the Secret Service leadership has a lot of questions to . answer.' 'Was the door open?' he added incredulously. Guns at the ready: An armed Secret Service guard stands in front of a fence with an automatic rifle .

Flying away: Obama, his daughter Sasha (second left) and an unidentified friend (left) were pictured heading to the Presidential retreat at Camp David . Experts say Friday's breach was the first time in recent memory that an intruder actually made it inside the White House after hopping the fence. The attempts, however, have been many: . Sept. 11: A 'Pokemon' nut wearing a bright-yellow Pikachu hat was caught walking down the North Lawn seconds after jumping. His motives remain unclear. Aug. 7: A presidential address on Iraq was postponed — and the whole place put on lockdown — after a toddler squeezed through the fence on Pennsylvania Avenue, making it onto the lawn. June 2013: Joseph Reel, of Ohio, crashed a driverless Jeep into the fence to create a distraction so he could enter and spray paint the White House. He was sentenced to 3 years behind bars. November 2009: Three people crashed a state dinner for Indian Premier Manmohan Singh. They somehow made it past several security checkpoints and even met President Obama. 2001-2009: Six people jumped the fence — but were all caught almost immediately after landing on the grass. One of them, Brian Patterson, was on his third attempt when he was caught in April 2006 . Although . it is not uncommon for people to make it over the White House fence, . they're typically stopped almost immediately and rarely get very far. Video . from the scene showed the Friday intruder, Gonzalez, sprinting across the lawn as Secret . Service agents shouted at nearby pedestrians to clear the area. 'This situation was a little different than other incidents we have at the White House,' Donovan said. 'This . incident . is the most shocking example yet of how dangerously lax the Secret . Service has become, failing at its most basic job — to protect the . president and first family in the White House,' said Washington insider . Ronald Kessler, who's written several books on the Secret Service. He added to MailOnline: 'Because of corner cutting and an ingrained cultural attitude by . management of ""we make do with less,"" the Secret Service is not . protecting the White House with adequate agents and uniformed officers . and is not keeping up to date with the latest devices for detecting . intruders and weapons of mass destruction' Kessler . — who revealed the embarrassing scandal about Secret Service agents . hiring prostitutes in Colombia — said it's 'arrogance' that the White . House doesn't even have a front door lock. 'If . the intruder were carrying chemical, biological or radiological weapons . and President Obama and his family had been in, we would have had a . dead president as well as a dead first family,' said Kessler, who . authored 'The First Family Detail: Secret Service Agents Reveal the .

"Arrested: Model Samantha Scarlino was a finalist in the Miss Italia beauty competition and is now a TV host . A Miss Italia beauty queen has been arrested as part of an alleged cocaine trafficking ring importing vast quantities of the drug from South America to Europe. Model Samantha Scarlino, who was a finalist in the beauty competition, was arrested at a Milan hotel, accused of offences related to the importation of 500 kg of the Class A drug. Prosecutors believe the cocaine seized was destined for Italy, Belgium, Holland, Spain and France. The 32-year-old is accused of transporting several deliveries of cash from Italy to gang bosses in Peru to be handed on the drug cartels. A 60-year-old kingpin from Milan is now wanted by police. The pageant contestant, who is well known in her home region of Puglia as a TV showgirl and film actress, was one of 22 arrested in connection with the ring. Charges include drug trafficking,  and production. Miss Scarlino was a finalist in the 1999 Miss Italia competition aged just 17. She told judges she wanted to be an actress saying ‘what’s missing is a good film with a female protagonist.’ The Miss Italy competition, a national institution that had endured for 70 years, was axed from state broadcaster Rai this year, a year after the bikini round was ditched in favour of old fashioned bathing costumes. Programmers said the competition was not longer ‘in line with the times.' Bad crowd: The pageant contestant, who is well known in her home region of Puglia as a TV showgirl, was one of 22 arrested in connection with the ring .

"A former Colorado police officer convicted of killing a treasured bull elk in Boulder has avoided prison time altogether and will instead serve 200 hours of community service for the crime that angered a local community and sparked marches and vigils. Ex-cop Sam Carter, 37,  was sentenced Friday to four years probation and will have to serve 30 days on a work crew, the Daily Camera reported. He'd faced a maximum punishment of six years behind bars. Carter, who will also have to pay $10,200 in fines, was convicted in June for shooting the beloved elk Big Boy as it grazed beneath a crabapple tree on New Year's Day 2013. Prosecutor Stan Garnett was seeking at . least a year in prison for Carter in part due to his 'flippant' and . 'arrogant' attitude toward his crime, 7News reported. But Judge . Patrick Butler said that type of sentence would be 'largely symbolic' and Carter would likely be released on parole in just a few months, . according to the Daily Camera. 'I . am not interested in symbolic gestures,' the judge said in court, the . news website reported. 'I want the sentence to benefit the community . that was harmed.' Ex-cop Sam Carter was sentenced to 200 hours of community service and probation for illegally killing the beloved elk Big Boy . Prosecutors had wanted Carter (left) to serve at least one year in prison and three years probation for the crime. His attorney Marc Colin (right) argued that the recommendation was too stiff . Spirit: Many in the Boulder neighborhood of Mapleton Hill admired the elk for its grace, and Big Boy's death fueled massive public outcry . Former cop Sam Carter was convicted of shooting and killing beloved elk Big Boy . During the hearing, Carter apologized to the citizens of Boulder and asked for a chance to 'repair the damage that I've caused.' 'I am haunted by this incident every day,' he said, according to the Daily Camera. In asking for prison time, Garnett told the judge the cop had shown no remorse for his actions. 'Carter shows no acknowledgement . of the impact of his acts on this community, on the Boulder Police . Department or on law enforcement in general, and remains, in the words . of the probation officer, ""flippant"" about his conduct,' Garnett wrote the sentencing judge, according to the station. 'Carter's . behavior while on duty as a uniformed police officer was reprehensible . and he should be sentenced to the Department of Corrections.' Defense Attorney Marc Colin said the sentence was 'well thought out and well reasoned,' the Daily Camera reported. Big Boy's death fueled massive public outcry after the officer claimed the elk was injured and he shot it to put the animal out of its misery — a claim neighbors in the Mapleton Hill neighborhood of Boulder denied. During his trial, Carter's attorney argued that the elk had become dangerously domesticated and was scaring local dogs. But prosecutors told the jury the killing was a case of poaching by an officer who sought to use his position to get an illegal trophy mount. After shooting the elk, prosecutors said, Carter called a friend and former officer to pick up the carcass and butcher it. They also said Carter later forged a tag to pass off the dead animal as road kill. Defense attorney Marc Collin (left) argued the ex-cop was protecting the community's fearful dogs from the 'nuisance' elk. Prosecutor Stan Garnett (right) maintained Carter was a ruthless elk killer who used . his position of power to try to get away with the illegal act . The trial opened with debate over whether the elk's prior 'bad conduct' could be used as evidence, and whether jurors familiar with Big Boy could be impartial. 'Sam Carter is not guilty of anything but trying to protect citizens of Boulder from a nuisance elk,' Colin argued, as some in the packed courtroom shook their heads. Prosecutors flashed a photo of the elk looking peaceful in a yard, and later showed another picture of a uniformed Carter hovering over the animal's carcass, grabbing its antlers and smiling. Prosecutors say Carter called another officer, Brent Curnow, to come cart away the body in his pickup truck, and together they butchered the animal for its meat. Curnow pleaded guilty last year to tampering with evidence and other charges. Beloved: A mourner placed a framed picture of the prized elk on a Christmas tree . Hundreds of Boulder residents gathered for a vigil to remember Big Boy in January 2013 . The officers swapped text messages about 'hunting' for 'wapiti,' the Shawnee word for elk. The exchanges culminated with a stark message from Carter to Curnow well before Carter's shift began: 'He's gonna die.' Nestled against the foothills and home to a Buddhist university, Boulder is known for its love of the outdoors. Its residents routinely rank among the country's most fit. Witnesses said the sight of the hulking animal was a highlight of countless hikes and jogs. 'Maybe we're strange, but the philosophy up here is live and let live,' pet supply store owner Mary Lee Withers said. 'That elk never did anything.' Carter's attorney, Marc Collin, told the Daily Camera he disagrees with the prosecutor's position. 'It's fair to say we are very disappointed in the DA's position,' he told the news outlet. 'It is not consistent with the way other criminal cases are treated.' Guardian: The beloved Big Boy was always seen around the community for several days before he was shot on New Year's Day 2013 .","Ex-cop Sam Carter was convicted of shooting the prized local elk known as Big Boy, who was the trophy of a neighborhood in Boulder, Colorado .

"A woman accused of trying to sneak aboard countless flights and was sentenced to jail less than two weeks ago in California has again been arrested at a Phoenix airport. Police say 62-year-old Marilyn Jean Hartman was taken into custody Tuesday on suspicion of criminal trespass after officials noticed her loitering near the baggage claim at Sky Harbor International Airport. Police are requesting a mental health evaluation for Hartman, who was ordered to spend 117 days in jail on August 13 for a probation violation, after she was spotted at Los Angeles International Airport when a court had banned from the premises just days earlier. However Hartman - who is said to have a 'fixation' on airports because they make her feel safe - was released Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood on August 16 - just three days later -  due to overcrowding. It is unclear how she made it from L.A. to Phoenix in the last 10 days. She will me remanded in custody pending a court hearing. Released: Marilyn Jean Hartman served just three days of a 117-day jail sentence - after violating her probation for repeatedly sneaking onto flights - due to overcrowding . Hartman, who has made previous attempts . to sneak aboard flights at other airports, was arrested August 4 after successfully taking a Southwest Airlines flight from San Jose to Los Angeles without a . ticket. Safe place: Marilyn Jean Hartman has a history of mental illness and has said that she feels safer in airports than on the streets . At Mineta San Jose International Airport, Hartman tried at least three times to get to a plane before she finally went past a security screener who was busy checking a family's documents, law enforcement officials said. She later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and unlawfully entering Los Angeles as a stowaway on an aircraft and was sentenced to two years of probation. Her boarding status was discovered once the Southwest flight landed in Los Angeles, the officials said. Hartman later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and unlawfully entering Los Angeles as a stowaway on an aircraft. A judge ordered her to stay away from LAX unless she had a valid ticket. Outside . the courthouse after sentencing, Hartman said she would never try to sneak . onto a plane again. 'It was stupid, and it is something I don't want to . repeat,' she said. However, . Los Angeles Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said he had a feeling . the woman 'with a fixation on flying' would return to LAX, so police . passed out fliers with her picture. 'She was (then) seen wandering through several terminals in what appeared to be a scouting mission,' he said. Repeated attempts:  Hartman was sentenced to 18 months probation for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound flights earlier in the year. She spent three days in jail . In . February, Hartman was sentenced to 18 months' probation in San Mateo . County after being arrested for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound . flights at San Francisco International Airport on three separate days. Her . breach of security at the San Jose airport caused federal officials and . the airline to launch investigations. It also prompted criticism of the . airport in light of the trespassing of a teenage boy who stowed away in . the wheel well of a Hawaiian Airlines flight and survived an arduous . journey to Maui. Hartman, who authorities say has a . history of mental illness, has now been arrested eight times for . trespassing at airports this year - though this is the first time she's . been caught after successfully boarding a flight. She . said last week that homelessness drove her to take 'desperate . measures,' and that she feels safer being in airports than in the . streets. San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said that Hartman has no family and has never married. According . to a her blog, found by the San Francisco Chronicle, she has lived in . sketchy motels and squalid apartments from Seattle to San Diego in the . last few years. Records . indicate Hartman was arrested November 6, 2010, at the Lihue Airport in . Kauai after trespassing into the baggage claim area, the Chronicle . reported. She was charged with simple trespass, but failed to show up . for court hearings - and remains the subject of a bench warrant. Plane fixation: Hartman tried at least three times to breach airport security before she was able to get through a checkpoint without a boarding pass at Mineta San Jose International Airport on Monday, August 4 . According . to the newspaper, Hartman said in her blog that she had successfully . hopped a plane once before. She was found out and detained - but later . released without charge. In May - after being arrested seven times at San Francisco International Airport - Hartman was placed in a mental treatment program but she stopped attending last month. 'She declined all of our efforts to offer her assistance,' Wagstaffe said. 'And we tried all of the alternatives we had because we weren't interested in locking her up on our end.' Then she went back to the San Francisco airport, but Wagstaffe's office declined to file charges after her seventh arrest in July for another failed attempt. On Monday, Hartman was only caught after the plane landed at Los Angeles International Airport and the crew counted the passengers who remained on board for the final destination to Phoenix. She was hauled off the plane and charged with trespassing by the Los Angeles Police Department.","Marilyn Jean Hartman, 62, was sentenced to 177 days in prison for violating her probation on August 13 .

"A political candidate in Colorado is under intense criticism and has even received death threats after suggesting the Newtown school shooting that killed 26 people was a hoax.

'When he walked into the room, he turned and all of a sudden had tears in his eyes. 'Why? I question that.' Ready on Saturday apologized for his remarks, telling the Denver Post that he simply 'pushed a button' to link to the article to encourage discussion. Yet he insisted to the Post that the country still doesn't know everything about Newtown — and also hinted that he's not a believer in the official version of the Kennedy assassination.

"Saved: The winning artwork was Madonna and Child by Renaissance master Pietro Perugino . As home to half the world’s artistic treasures, it is hardly surprising that cash-strapped Italy struggles to pay for their upkeep. But officials, faced with unbearable choices on which masterpieces to save, have come up with a very novel solution – opening a Facebook vote to the public. The government selected eight pieces of art in urgent need of restoration from across Italy and posted them on the social networking website. The artworks ranged from an ancient Roman marble horse, which is on display in the world famous Uffizi Gallery, in Florence, to a painting of Mary Magdalene at the feet of Christ by Renaissance artist Fiorentino, which hangs in the Accademia museum in Venice. The public were asked to click on the work that most deserved to be repaired. The winner, following thousand of votes, was a Madonna and Child by Renaissance master Pietro Perugino, which is now undergoing restoration. The other pieces will also be fixed as budgets permit, officials said. Minister for Culture, Massimo Bray, said Italians wanted more opportunities to share in the difficult choices that had to be made about the country’s heritage. Anna Maria Buzzi, head of heritage at the Culture Ministry explained: ‘Italy needs help restoring its art and monuments. ‘Ticket . sales alone are not enough to completely fund their upkeep. We don’t . even have a full understanding of how much art exists in the country.’ The artworks included several currently on display in the world famous Uffizi Gallery in Florence (pictured) She added: ‘The strength of a democratic institution is listening to its citizens.’ ‘Giving people the right to choose makes them more invested in their own heritage. It makes them care more. If you give the people more responsibility, they’re more likely to take an interest in their own culture.’ Italy is increasingly reliant on private companies to pay for renovations. Accessories brand Fendi has donated £2million to repair Rome’s Trevi fountain (left), while Diesel is paying for Venice’s Rialto bridge (right) Italy spends billions less on its cultural gems than either France or Germany. Of European Union countries, only Greece invests less. The country’s globally renowned archeological sites, such as Pompeii, suffer regular collapses for lack of repair. Over the last year private companies have attempted to fill the gap, with luxury footwear label Tod’s footing the bill for the five-year restoration of the Colosseum. Meanwhile homegrown accessories brand Fendi has donated £2million for the repair of Rome’s Trevi fountain, the famous setting for the 1960s film, La Dolce Vita, and youthful fashion house Diesel has stepped in to cover the maintenance of Venice’s Rialto bridge.","Thousands vote to save artwork by Renaissance master Pietro Perugino .

"The husband of a jogger found strangled in a park has been charged with her murder, police said Sunday, days after they warned female runners to take extra precautions until the killer was caught. Authorities announced the arrest of 48-year-old Christopher Murray at a Sunday afternoon news conference. His 46-year-old wife, Constance, was found dead Tuesday in Pennypack Park in northeast Philadelphia. The mother of two had been out running the night before. 'The reality was he became a suspect early on and remained a suspect until he confessed,' Lt. Philip Riehl said. Killed: Christopher Murray has confessed to strangling his wife Constance after an argument. Her body was found in a cemetery last Tuesday morning in a Philadelphia suburb . Riehl said Murray has expressed remorse. 'I think it was more of a rage incident more than premeditated,' he said. Investigators say Murray trailed his wife in a car while she went out Monday night, and the two began to argue. Police say Murray continued to follow her, and the pair went to a bench at the park where they continued to fight. 'She went up there voluntarily to talk to him about whatever was going on and things went bad,' Riehl said. Christopher Murray strangled his wife and left her body near the bench, police said. He called police early Wednesday to report her missing, and a woman walking her dog found Connie Murray's body a few hours later. Surveillance video showed Christopher Murray in his vehicle, and he was taken in for questioning Saturday night, police said. Riehl said aspects of his story didn't add up. He failed a lie detector test and then confessed, Riehl said. On Friday a $36,000 reward was offered for information leading to her disappearance. Confession: Police say Christopher Murray, pictured with his wife Constance and the couple's two daughters admitted to strangling her .

An autopsy revealed she had been strangled. Her funeral was held Sunday. The couple have two daughters, ages 12 and 15. In a phone interview with the Philadelphia Daily News last week, Christopher Murray described his wife's death as 'devastating' and said she was 'a beautiful woman, a loving, caring mother, a fabulous friend.' The married mother was not sexually assaulted but bruising showed that a minor struggle had taken place. A large gathering of friends and family, including her two young daughters, were seen embracing each other outside the Murray home on Wednesday. she was found dead. Local residents have been left stunned in the leafy, suburban community. Court papers weren't immediately available, and it's unclear if Murray has an attorney. Murray was denied bail, and no attorney is listed for him in court papers. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Aug. 27.

"At a prep school in Kent, during High Tea, a master asks his pupils if anyone would like to do ballet. In a sea of waving girls’ paws, only one little boy’s hand shoots up. Mine. And then, with howl of the other children’s laughter echoing in my ears, I realised: boys don’t do ballet. So I bottled out, and I have always regretted it. Called to the Barre: Richard Dennen is put through his paces in his BarreCorre class by owner Niki Rein . Today, male ballet dancers are the new rock stars. The Adonis-like Brazilian Carlos Acosta is a household name and Sergei Polunin, a 23-year-old tattooed Russian wild child, made headlines when he sensationally quit as principal of the Royal Ballet last year. Now, apparently, rock stars are doing ballet. Mick Jagger, a sprightly 69 and preparing to headline the Glastonbury Festival with The Rolling Stones next weekend, has revealed how he credited his remarkable fitness to ballet. Then I heard about the ballet-based workout class at Barrecore studio on Kings Road, Chelsea, run by fitness guru Niki Rein. She is rumoured to be behind Princess Beatrice’s new figure and I was intrigued to find out what you have to go through to get a ballet body... NOT JUST FOR GIRLS . The . class is actually a hybrid of Pilates and ballet, incorporating cardio, . light weights and various stretching and balancing poses, all to music. Moves like me: Mick Jagger, 69, takes regular ballet classes to keep physically fit . It’s most certainly not just for girls. ‘Half of the guys who come can’t finish their first class,’ says Niki. ‘We work on legs and the lower half of the body, which men aren’t used to. 'Men are stronger in the upper body so they power through press-ups. But then they stand at the barre and after the first set of thighs their legs are all over the place, the eyes glaze over .  .  . they start to get dizzy.’ I thought I was going to die after my first class, but I could quickly see why it’s becoming a cult hit. A number of gyms have started offering ballet-style workouts, and Britain’s biggest, Virgin Active, is looking at rolling it out nationwide. There is genuine sports science behind it. Gillian Reeves, national group exercise manager for Virgin Active, explains: ‘Ballet improves posture, balance and co-ordination. 'The exercises all promote muscular strength and endurance but won’t bulk the body, helping to give that lean, dancer physique. For the greatest benefits, a healthy diet is needed also.’ A PERKIER BOTTOM . Niki promises longer, leaner limbs and the pert bottom of a dancer. ‘Ballet makes you leaner, and stand taller. 'There is a focus on the back of the body and if the back is strong, then it makes the shoulders look broader, you carry yourself taller, and the waist looks smaller.’ Niki arrived in London in 2009 after working with dance-cardio celebrity trainer Tracey Anderson and celebrities including Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow. She started a private barre class in a client’s mews house and, when 25 ladies turned up, quickly realised that London needed her. THIGHS FEEL THE BURN . The class, for normally no more than ten to 15 people, lasts an hour and takes place in a dance studio with a mirrored wall and a long rail – the barre – that runs the length of the room, just above my waist height. Ideal Adonis: Ballet rockstar Carlos Acosta is an fitness inspiration for men across the globe . After a warm-up, there are press-ups and planks (where you hold the extended press-up position until your middle is shaking with the strain) .  .  . and then the real workout starts. There are various ballet-inspired positions: holding a ball between your thighs, you stand on tiptoe and pulse up and down. In another you lean forward with your head on the bar, wiggling your leg while it’s extended behind you. My thighs burn, my legs tremble. Later, I am so stiff and sore I think I might have done permanent damage. IT WORKS... BUT IT HURTS . After a month of going once a week, I am gradually getting more flexible. Like most men, I have very tight hamstrings. But now my standing splits – where you bend forward, hands flat on the floor, while you try to extend one leg back and point to the ceiling – are getting a bit better. We’re told that 15 minutes of ballet can burn up to 100 calories, and my body has changed. I am slimmer: if anything, I look at bit too skinny. But the gender divide remains: in a month I only saw one other man in the class. I think that boys are scared of ballet. You have to swallow your pride, as I did, collapsing on the mat while the woman next to me did 15 push-ups with her leg in the air. To anyone who is man enough to try it, I can confirm it works. But God, it hurts. Hour-long classes start from £24 at the Barrecore  studio, Kings Road, London SW3. barrecore.co.uk.","Mick Jagger credits his fitness to regular ballet classes .

Canadian authorities identified the victims as 41-year-old Nikolas Rajala, 40-year-old Teresa Rajala, and 36-year-old Lynn Bohanon, all of Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Police say the three were staying at a fishing lodge in the area, and were on a fishing trip when the crash occurred. Mr Rajala was a self-employed logger who was flying on the day, according to Itasca County Commissioner Rusty Eichorn. The Star Tribune reports he had been flying since high school. His wife, Teresa was a was a retail sales clerk and a house cleaner. The couple had bought the plane from Ms Bohanon, a pharmacist and avid outdoorswoman. Mr Eichorn, who had been dating Ms Bohanon for six years ago, told the Star Tribune: 'I loved her dearly. She died doing something that she loved to do, which is flying and fishing.' Mr Eichorn described Mr Rajala as 'a good friend, an accomplished pilot. Whatever happened is catastrophic. It happens fast, and you don’t believe it… something went sideways on landing… it fades to black.' Ontario Provincial Police and the Canadian Transportation Safety Board are investigating the cause of the crash.

"Tired of trying to tempt your children into a plate of greens? Well one supermarket suggests you try a more colourful approach. Tesco is hoping to give exasperated parents a helping hand in getting their youngsters to eat beetroot with their latest launch, the sweetroot. Beetroots are known to be a superfood packed with nutritional benefits but they are also notoriously unpopular with children. Tesco are launching two new vibrant varieties of beetroot in a hope to encourage children to eat them . Traditionally beetroot has suffered from a so-called 'Marmite syndrome', with people 50 and above enjoying it and the younger generation disliking it. It has seen a resurgence recently, but it is the juice variety that is seeing rocketing sales rather than the raw vegetable. However, Tesco are hoping to change this when they launch a sweeter version of the root exclusively across UK stores tomorrow. The supermarket giant will be offering two long-lost varieties, the organic candy stripe beetroot and the golden beetroot. The candy stripe variety is officially called Chiogga and is named after the northern Italian coastal town where it was first cultivated in the early 1800s. Beetroot has traditionally suffered from 'marmite syndrome' with the younger generation disliking it . The golden beetroot is a Victorian variety that also goes by the name of Burpee's golden, after the American seed house where it was first grown. The colourful veg is said to have a sweeter flavour than the dark purple original and this combined with the bright appearance is said to encourage children to eat them. Tesco beetroot buyer Ravi Patel says he understands the struggle that parents go through when it comes to meal times but hopes their Candy Stripe Beetroot can help. 'Every parent knows that getting youngsters to eat vegetables is never easy but we believe that the Candy Stripe variety will help make that dinner time task a lot simpler. 'We've worked with our main beetroot grower to see how we could encourage more people to enjoy this wonderful vegetable and discovered that this sweeter Candy Stripe variety had generally been forgotten about and never been grown on a commercial scale before. The Candy Stripe Beetroot is said to taste sweeter than the traditional deep purple root . 'It looks and tastes absolutely wonderful and will definitely also bring a lot of colour and fun to the dinner table.' The new varieties have been grown by the UK's biggest producers of beetroot, Gs, based in Ely, Cambridgeshire, which offers perfect growing conditions of soil, sun and water to produce a sweet, full-flavoured root. G's managing director Anthony Gardiner says that these new vegetables should be enough to add a little excitement to children's meal times. 'We were specifically looking for varieties of beetroot that would excite the palates of a new audience of shoppers seeking healthy foods. 'We know that beetroot is becoming more popular but thought that if we could add a sweeter profile as well as introducing different coloured varieties we could help widen this wonderful vegetable's appeal.' Ravi added that he hopes the new take on the unpopular veg will encourage a whole new generation of fans of the root. 'We're hoping that both these varieties will appeal to a whole new audience.' Both varieties will be sold in 450 gram packs and will cost £1.50 each. Fat-Free with typically less than 0.5g fat per 100g . Low in calories with typically less than 37 calories (kcal) per 100g . Low in salt for healthy blood pressure . Seven slices of fresh or bottled beetroot (or three 'baby' whole beetroots) count as one of your five-a-day .

"A furious Prince William wants those responsible for printing the topless pictures of his wife jailed, it has emerged. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge looked happy as they ventured into the Borneo jungle yesterday - just 24 hours after the controversial pictures of Kate were published in a French magazine. But despite their relaxed appearance, it has emerged the angry Prince is keen to pursue a criminal prosecution against those who snooped on his wife. Scroll down for video . Smiling: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge ventured into the jungle in Borneo yesterday. Judging by their expressions, though, no one could have guessed that the previous 24 hours had left the Royal couple 'livid' and 'violated' Fun: While the storm over the topless  photographs of Kate continued to rage elsewhere, they spent the day smiling and joking as they scaled a giant tree . On Friday night St James' Palace confirmed the Royal couple would sue Closer Magazine France. But it has now emerged Prince William is keen to take criminal action, and has vowed to give evidence at a trial. According to The Sunday Mirror, when speaking to aides about those responsible for printing the pictures, the angry Prince said: 'I want them jailed.' A spokesman for Prince William added that he had always felt strongly about privacy and harassment. He added: 'It’s . part of a very long-standing and heartfelt position by the Duke and . Prince Harry, given their past, to do everything they can to protect . themselves. 'They’ve always said they don’t have an issue with the . mainstream media just doing their job, but they have always had an issue . with paparazzi whose work intrudes on their privacy.' The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge ventured into the jungle yesterday. This time it was the rainforest variety in Borneo, rather than the legal or media kind. It seemed a symbolically fitting backdrop to their troubles. Judging by their expressions, though, no one could have guessed that the previous 24 hours had left the Royal couple ‘livid’ and ‘violated’. While the storm over the topless  photographs of Kate continued to rage elsewhere – more pictures were  published in Ireland – they spent the day smiling and joking as they scaled a giant tree, photographed orang-utans and admired exotic flowers. Strolling on the canopy: This was the type of jungle they could enjoy, a sanctuary from the vicissitudes of the outside world . Don't look down: William strolls along the canopy bridge high above the rainforest as Kate follows him with a glimpse below . Jungle king and queen: Kate and William after crossing the canopy to a small wooden balcony overlooking the forest . This was the type of jungle they could enjoy, a sanctuary from the vicissitudes of the outside world. They even wanted to stay the night. It was a case of I’m A Royal, Keep Me In Here. Pretty much their every move was scrutinised of course, but even that didn’t seem to matter too much. At . one point, having been winched high into the jungle canopy, William . spotted a photographer who had been granted official permission to perch . in an adjacent tree. It . must have been quite a shock. But where the previous day he had . glowered at anyone with a lens, the future King was now all smiles. ‘We . saw a spy in a tree,’ he later reported, laughing. Thousands . of miles away, St James’s Palace was fighting a legal battle on several . fronts to prevent the further spread of the offending images. They . were taken by a photographer using  a long lens as the couple . sunbathed  on the balcony of Viscount Linley’s chateau in the south of . France ahead of their nine-day tour of the Far East.Tomorrow, lawyers will seek an injunction in a French court. They are also thought to be trying to halt the publication of what is being billed as a ‘26-page photo special’ in an Italian magazine. Yet the Palace could do nothing to stop the Irish edition of the Daily Star printing the same topless pictures  yesterday, a move that even horrified the paper’s owners, who were not  notified beforehand. Relaxed: The Royal couple even wanted to stay the night. It was a case of I'm A Royal, Keep Me In Here . On tour: William and Kate prepare to set off on their walk of the rainforest . Casual look: No designer dresses for Kate who wore tight-fitting jeans with a leather belt and green shirt . Thoughtful: The topless pictures are said to have left the royal couple feeling 'anger and disbelief' The move was defended by Michael . O’Kane, the editor of the Dublin-based newspaper, which is a joint . venture between Northern & Shell – the  publisher of the UK Daily . Star owned by Richard Desmond – and Ireland’s Independent News and . Media. But Mr Desmond said . that he was ‘profoundly dismayed’ at the newspaper’s decision, while a . Northern  & Shell spokesman conceded that  it was a ‘grotesque . invasion’ of the couple’s privacy.Outrage came from all quarters. The . Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, said: ‘It would be a very sad day . when we are taken into the gutter of believing that every woman wants to . flaunt her body for all to see. ‘The . only time we cannot escape revealing our nakedness is when we are born. Beyond that our culture has said that the only other time should be in . the privacy of our homes.’ In . another development, a female French photographer who took pictures of . the Duchess sunbathing at the chateau – but not, she says, the topless . ones – tried to distance herself from the affair. Chateau D'Autet near Veins, Provence, Southern France, where the young royal couple were relaxing . Invasion of privacy: The Lay by (bottom left) on . the opposing valley slope is where is where it is believed the pictures . were shot with a long zoom camera . Valerie Suau’s work, which she . insisted was ‘decent’, was published  in La Provence newspaper last . Saturday with no complaint from the Royal Family. ‘Valerie is extremely concerned by the fuss and is naturally keeping a low profile,’ said a colleague.The . look of thunder on Prince William’s face as he left Kuala Lumpur, teeth . clenched, yesterday morning was obvious. But it subsided by the time . the Royal party reached Sabah, one of the two states that make up the . Malaysian part of Borneo. The . Duchess was dressed for  the jungle in slim-cut beige jeans  and a . plaited brown leather belt,  sturdy walking boots, and a sheer  green . blouse over a black T-shirt. The . couple declined the use of ‘anti-leech socks’. ‘Apparently they didn’t . pass the sartorial test,’ explained one of  their party. However, . the Duchess may have regretted that decision as a jungle leech later . attached itself to her leg. ‘She dealt with it very calmly and just bent . down and picked it off.’ Grotesque: The magazine put three naked photos of the Duchess of Cambridge on the front cover . Tengku Adlin, a Malaysian prince who . had previously accompanied Prince Philip in a helicopter flight over the . rainforest when he visited the region in 1972, flew in with  the . couple. He said: ‘They enjoyed it immensely, . they asked lots of questions about primates, birds and insects, and Kate . was taking a lot of photos.’ On arriving at a field centre, the couple . attended a short briefing with a group of Malaysian and  British . scientists. They were then . fitted with special harnesses and helmets in a private room before being . hoisted 138ft up into a giant parashorea tomentella tree using a . ‘counterweight pulley system’ which had been set by technicians to their . combined weight, believed to be about 23 stone. As . they waited in their harnesses at the base of the tree, the Duke looked . at his wife and quipped:  ‘Girls don’t have the same wardrobe . malfunctions as men do. ‘I hope I don’t have any wardrobe malfunctions.’ The Duchess, appearing apprehensive as she looked upwards at her route of ascent, said: ‘I’m going to go “whee” and just fly up.’ William joked: ‘It’s not quite as impressive as the Shard,’ referring to his uncle the Duke of York’s abseil from London’s tallest building. Dr Glen Reynolds, the director  of the Royal Society’s South East Asia research programme, who accompanied the couple, replied: ‘Size isn’t everything.’ The Duke and Duchess had such a good time that they hoped to spend the night in the jungle but their team decided against it lest the unpredictable and fast-changing weather  prevented them from advancing on to the Solomon Islands today on the next stage of their tour.","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge ventured into the jungle in Borneo and looked happy and relaxed - despite controversy over topless pictures .

"Victor Piturca has resigned as Romania coach in order to take charge at Saudi Arabian club Al Ittihad. Piturca's decision comes after Romania's 2-0 win over Finland on Tuesday moved them up to second place in Group F of the Euro 2016 qualifiers ahead of next month's meeting with group leaders Northern Ireland. Victor Piturca has stepped down from his post with Romania to take over at Al Ittihad . 'The Romanian Football Federation and Victor Piturca have cancelled today, October 16 2014, by mutual consent, the contract for the post of coach of the Romanian national team and the contracts of the other members of coaching staff,' a statement on the Romanian Football Federation (FRF) website said. The FRF has called a press conference for Monday to discuss their next step with the national team.

"The Catholic Church is seeking the opinions of ordinary people on gay unions, contraception and sex before marriage, in an extraordinary bid to become more ‘credible’. A questionnaire has been sent from the Vatican polling lay parishioners as well as bishops and theologians on its teachings on all issues affecting families and relationships including divorce and single parent families. The 38-question survey, which comes ahead of a meeting of the Synod on the Family in 2014, is the first time that the church has asked these questions of ordinary people since the 1960s. 'Strict' Pope Francis said the Vatican needs to tone down its strict teachings on the family . Catholic Church of England and Wales has already set up an online survey to make it easier for parishioners to give their opinions. The questionnaire asks whether the Catholic teachings on marriage and the family ‘are widely known’ and ‘to what extent they are actually known, accepted, rejected and/or criticised in areas outside the Church.’ Pope Francis has already said the Vatican needs to tone down its strict teachings on the family. If the church continues ‘to obsess’ about issues such as divorce and abortion it ‘risks falling like a house of cards’, he said in September. A letter from Archbishop Lorenzo Baldisseri, Secretary General of the Synod, accompanying the questionnaire, was sent to bishops in every continent asking for them to distribute the poll ""immediately as widely as possible to deaneries and parishes so that input from local sources can be received."" Answers need to be returned by the end of January. The feedback will help civil servants inside the Vatican prepare for the Synod of Bishops in October 2014. The theme of the meeting will be 'The Pastoral Challenges of the Family in the Context of Evangelisation'. An accompanying document sent out with the questionnaire said that Pope Francis is concerned with issues 'unheard of until a few years ago,' such as the 'widespread practice of cohabitation, which does not lead to marriage and sometimes even excludes the very idea of it, same-sex unions between persons who are, not infrequently, permitted to adopt children' and 'a culture of non-commitment.' Questionnaire: The Vatican has sent out the survey to all parishioners as well as bishops and theologians . Also to be addressed will be 'forms of feminism hostile to the Church,' 'single-parent wombs for hire and new interpretations of what is considered a human right.' The document notes that even within the Church, 'faith in the sacramentality of marriage and the healing power of the confession show signs of weakness or total abandonment'. The move has already been welcomed by some as 'an outstretched hand' to dissidents. Chicago’s archbishop Cardinal Francis George, said: 'The Vatican under Pope Francis seems to be offering an outstretched hand to the people of the church, but even more so, the Vatican is encouraging the bishops to be listeners to the voice of the people.'","38-question survey is available online in England and Wales .

"Favourite night out: Prince Harry leaving Tonteria . It used to be Boujis. Then it was Mahiki. But now Prince Harry has a new playground – a Mexican-themed nightclub which hosts some of the wildest nights in London. The club, called Tonteria, regularly features dancers dressed in bondage-style lingerie. A bottle of tequila costs £5,000 – and VIP clients can have their drinks delivered to their table by toy train. Such is the 29-year-old Prince’s fondness for the place, earlier this month he was there on a Monday, Thursday and Saturday, three nights out of the four that the club is open. Arrangements have been made to try to ensure Harry is never photographed arriving, leaving, or at the club. Non-VIP visitors must obey a ‘selfies-only’ rule to protect him and other high-profile revellers from unwanted attention. It is a rule that is strictly enforced. On July 12, at a World Cup party, the club’s co-owner, Marc Burton, snatched phones from two excitable young Chelsea girls who had dared to point them in the direction of Harry as he breezed past them to join his entourage of friends in the tiny VIP room. The girls ended up in tears and eventually their phones were returned, but only after the blurry photos were deleted. A discreet side entrance takes Harry from the Sloane Square Hotel next door directly into the club’s VIP area, so he never has to walk past paparazzi. He even has use of a private marble bathroom. On the Thursday night, Harry would have witnessed the club’s famously bacchanalian Do Not Disturb party, when dancers dressed in latex lingerie weave between flame throwers and customers, who are encouraged to interact. On Mondays, Mexican wrestlers tussle with each other, and also perform for guests queuing up outside in Chelsea’s Sloane Square. Harry is often seen drinking shots with the barmen while topless men wearing giant skulls on their heads patrol the club with sparklers. Prince William visited the club last year, and the Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie have also been spotted there. Other celebrities seen enjoying the club’s attractions include model Cara Delevingne, Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Timberlake and singer Jessie J – and Harry’s former girlfriend Cressida Bonas. Once inside, thirsty guests can choose from the club’s cocktail menu. If they choose a bottle of Reserva Del Alma from the Tonteria Ultimate Tequila list, it will set them back £5,000. One of the club’s large bottles of champagne is priced at £28,000. The club’s signature drinks are frozen margaritas served in vessels shaped like Mayan pyramids and Day of the Dead skulls. Those who don’t want to battle through the throng for their drinks can have the club’s most expensive tequilas delivered to private tables on an electronic train called the Jose Cuervo Express. Scroll down for video . Pick of the crop: Two models in provocative pose at the launch party for Tonteria's Do Not Disturb theme nights . On the same night that the girls had their phones confiscated, it was reported that Harry was spotted ‘in a clinch’ with Camilla Thurlow, a former Miss Edinburgh. The pretty 25-year-old works for the Halo Trust, a landmine charity made famous by Harry’s mother Princess Diana. She was famously photographed visiting a minefield in Angola which Halo workers were helping to clear. Shortly before Harry and Camilla were seen enjoying a kiss, the Prince had been seen chasing the young charity worker around the VIP area brandishing an inflatable medal. The tiny VIP room used by Harry has a special black curtain that is sometimes closed to stop drunken revellers from peeking in and causing a nuisance, although Harry rarely asks for it to be drawn. One regular at the club told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘If it was up to him, he wouldn’t even be in the VIP room. He’s very casual.’ Private: The club's entrance at the Sloane Square Hotel. Prince Harry is said to take a more discreet entrance . The Mexican theme extends to the club’s decoration, with walls covered in colourful graffiti. One sign reads, ‘Tequila is a sneaky BITCH. One minute you are SEXY dancing, the next you are on the floor, PANTLESS making out with a SHOE – Tonteria.’ A popular saying on the club’s Twitter account is, ‘One shot, two shot, three shot, floor!” A source said of the nightclub: ‘Tonteria tends to be a pretty wild night out and can often get quite out of hand. But the staff there recognise the need for discretion and confidentiality when it comes to the club’s VIP guests. ‘Quite often Prince Harry can spend the whole night at the club without anyone knowing he is there. The VIP area is tightly guarded and guests are given complete privacy. Popular: Cressida Bonas has also visited Tonteria . ‘It makes it much easier for celebrities to enjoy themselves, knowing that they won’t be photographed and gawped at.’ Food at Tonteria includes Mexican delicacies such as nachos, quesadillas, burritos and fajitas. They are served during a ‘pre-dinner’ sitting, after which the lights are dimmed and the restaurant tables are removed in order to create space on the dance floor. It’s no surprise that the bizarre club – which translates as ‘folly, foolery, nonsense or silliness’ in Spanish – is the brainchild of Harry’s best friend, nightclub entrepreneur Guy Pelly. He decided to open it after his last Chelsea venture, a club called Public, closed down in 2012. He had spent a year battling with authorities to keep it open after it was branded a public nuisance and ‘number one crime generator’. Last week, Pelly, 32, received his third drink-driving ban. He had been stopped by police after leaving Tonteria in his £90,000 Audi R8 GTV10 Coupe. He was banned for two-and-a-half years and ordered to pay £7,120 in costs and fines. In September last year, a video created by Pelly and his Tonteria colleagues advertising their Do Not Disturb club night had to be removed from YouTube after violating the website’s explicit content regulations. Pelly did not appear in the film but was credited as its director. The offending video, which starred up-and-coming British model Jake Hold, featured several scenes of nudity, sexual activity, bondage, sadism and masochism. A Tonteria spokesman insisted at the time that it was ‘all in good fun’. Bored with walking to the bar?

"Tasered teen: Bryce Masters isno longer in a medically induced coma and is speaking with family members . The Missouri police officer who used a stun gun on a 17-year-old during a traffic stop says he smelled marijuana in the vehicle and saw him recording the incident on an iPhone. Bryce Masters has been upgraded from critical to serious condition at a hospital where he was taken Sunday after the Independence police officer used a Taser on him. A spokesman for Masters' family says he went into cardiac arrest and was being treated for a lack of oxygen to his brain. According to a search warrant application, the officer smelled marijuana inside the car. Police said they later found drug paraphernalia. Police say Masters was pulled over because of a warrant attached to the license plate of the vehicle and was combative when ordered to get out. The Kansas City Star reports  Masters  began slowly recovering overnight Wednesday. Family attorney Daniel Haus characterized the recovery as a miracle. Masters' family has said his heart stopped after he was shocked with the stun gun during a traffic stop on Sunday in Independence. Bryce suffered some memory loss and doctors do not yet know what the long term affects will be. Police say he was combative and wouldn't comply with the officer's demands. They say he was pulled over because of a warrant associated with the license plate on the car, which belonged to someone else. 'They are seeing some signals that their son may make a fairly remarkable recovery, basically coming back from the dead,' Haus told the Kansas City Star.'It looks like whatever the doctors did with this medically induced coma, this new procedure where they lower the body temperature, was exactly what he needed,' Haus added. The FBI is investigating after a police officer used a stun gun to subdue Bryce Masters in suburban Kansas City, Missouri, on Sunday afternoon after stopping a car he was driving because it had a warrant attached to it. The officer, identified by the police department as Tim Runnels, has been placed on administrative leave. An eyewitness filmed the incident on her cell phone. In the footage you can see the officer dragging the Bryce's body to the sidewalk, then standing with his foot on the teen's back (ringed) Police said in the statement that Bryce became uncooperative and physically resisted getting out of the car, prompting Runnels to warn Bryce he would use a stun gun. Police said the stun gun was used on Bryce while he was still in the car but he was able to get out of the car on his own. The confrontation continued outside the car and both Bryce and Runnels fell to the ground. The teen then suffered a 'medical emergency' and needed resuscitation, prompting a call for an ambulance, police said. But eyewitnesses gave a different account to Fox4KC. Michelle Baker filmed the incident on her mobile phone when she heard screams outside and says she saw the Runnels Taser the teen when he was inside his car. In a cell phone video taken by Baker you can see the officer dragging the teen's body to the sidewalk, then standing with his foot on the teen's back. You could tell the kid was going into convulsions. 'He turned him over and his head was dangling like this and he had blood coming out,' said Baker. Curtis Martes, 17, says the teen was coming over to play XBox with him. 'I hear him say from my porch he's like 'I can't roll down my window it's broke,' said Martes. 'He was like 'what am I being arrested for?' The cop just grabbed him and said 'you're under arrest,' said Martes. The officer, identified by the police department as Tim Runnels, has been placed on administrative leave. The footage, shot on Sunday, shows him walking up to the Bryce's body (left) and stepping over it right) He is then (pictured) seen raising his foot as Master lies on the ground. 'He like threw him on the ground busted his face up. He kept like nudging him with his foot,' said Curtis Martes, 17, who watched the event unfold . He said the officer Tasered the teen then pulled him out of the car. 'He like threw him on the ground busted his face up. He kept like nudging him with his foot,' said Martes. 'Several times, the cop put his foot on the kid like he was stepping on his neck, but it was on his back,' said Robert Baker, who lives nearby told The Kansas City Star. 'I think (the officer) was wrong, because the kid tried to explain to him that his window won't roll down.' The FBI's Kansas City office will investigate whether Runnels used excessive force, which falls under the bureau's civil rights program, the FBI said in a statement. Independence police pledged to cooperate with the investigation. Masters is the son of a Kansas City police officer.

"The controversial new chairman of the Government’s historic child abuse inquiry has promised to answer critics who say she is too close to a key figure at the centre of scandal. Fiona Woolf has for the past fortnight refused to comment on revelations by The Mail on Sunday that she has close links to former Tory grandee Leon Brittan, who is accused of failing to investigate alleged VIP paedophile rings when he was Home Secretary. A top commercial lawyer and the Lord Mayor of London, Mrs Woolf, 66, has finally bowed to pressure to answer the growing concerns, which have been raised in Parliament. Critics of Fiona Woolf, pictured, said she is too close to Leon Brittain who lives on the same street as her . She was challenged about her position at the Lloyd’s of London Abseil event on Friday, where she and other fundraisers descended the distinctive 289ft building in aid of charity. Before donning her helmet and equipment, Mrs Woolf was asked whether she had declared her friendship with the Brittans to the Home Office. She confirmed: ‘I shall be making a statement.’ Mrs Woolf sits on the same City conference board as Lord Brittan and has lived in the same upmarket street as him for a decade. She also worked as a magistrate alongside his wife Lady Brittan for three years and judges a business award with her.

"Theresa May’s Cabinet role could be under threat from Boris Johnson if voters get their way when the London Mayor makes his anticipated Commons return next year. Asked which Cabinet job David Cameron should give Mr Johnson, Mrs May’s Home Secretary role is the top choice in one of two polls that will boost the growing ‘Boris mania’ in the Conservative Party. A second survey suggests he will double the Conservative majority if he stands in Uxbridge, Middlesex, where the party is seeking a candidate for next year’s General Election. Is this the face of a future Home Secretary? An opinion poll suggests that voters want Boris Johnson in the Home Office instead of Theresa May, the present incumbent . Asked which Cabinet role Mr Johnson should be given if he returns as an MP, the first choice is Home Secretary, according to a ComRes poll commissioned by public affairs firm PLMR. However, Mr Johnson’s Tory critics, who claim he lacks attention to detail, may draw comfort from the Cabinet seats voters do not want him to occupy. Chancellor of the Exchequer, occupied by George Osborne, who is seen as a future Tory leadership rival to Mr Johnson, comes sixth on the list of preferred Cabinet posts for him. Defence Secretary, which includes responsibility for nuclear weapons, is in last place. Job in danger or the Tory Party's second female leader? Some voters want Boris Johnson to replace Theresa May (left) in the Home Office but they do not want him in Number 11 where George Osborne (right) is seen as another possible Tory leader . A separate poll by Tory peer Lord Aschroft puts Mr Johnson on course for a massive victory if he is picked for Uxbridge, where the current MP Sir John Randall is standing down. Sir John won an 11,216 majority at the last Election, but more than half of people in Uxbridge would vote for Mr Johnson if he stands there in 2015, claims the poll. According to the survey, when asked which party they would vote for in Uxbridge, the Tories have a 14-point majority over Labour. However, if Mr Johnson stands, the margin more than doubles to 29. Mr Johnson has until August 28 to apply to stand in Uxbridge.","Home Office is where voters asked would most like to see Boris Johnson .
However, they do not want him anywhere the keys of Number 11 .

"The Sicilian mafia ordered the assassination of former mayor of New York Rudolph Giuliani, a court in Palermo has heard. ‘Boss of all bosses’ Salvatore ‘Toto’ Riina, allegedly planned the hit when Giuliani was a state prosecutor in the 1980s. Giuliani, a second generation Italian immigrant, went on to become the city’s mayor and a national hero for his work combatting organised crime. Marked man: A court heard that former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani (left) was an assassination target of reputed Mafia 'boss of bosses' Salvatore 'Toto' Riina, pictured on the right during a trial in Rome in April 1993 . The plot was revealed in evidence from supergrass Rosario Naimo, at a trial in Sicily in which representatives of the Italian state are accused of signing a peace treaty with the mafia in the 1990s. The claim that Giuliani was a target was made by supergrass Rosario Naimo . Former mafioso Naimo told the prosecutor that Riina, who is serving multiple life sentences for dozens of homicides, dispatched his henchman to the US to organise the murder, Italian news agency ANSA reported. Naimo, who lived in the US for years, claims a sworn Mafioso, or ‘man of honour’, named Benedetto Villico, approached him with a letter from Riina, nicknamed the Beast because of his love for violence. The letter ordered Giuliani’s death. Giuliani has previously claimed that there was a price on his head during the 1990s, when he was mayor. He told Oprah Winfrey last year: ‘They offered $800,000 to kill me. Then toward the end of the time I was mayor, a particular mafia guy who was convicted and put in jail for 100 years put out a contract to kill me for $400,000. I kind of felt bad that I went down in value.’ Ties: Giuliani was a target because of his friendship with Italian judge Giovanni Falcone . Giuliani became a target because of his friendship with Sicilian anti-mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, who led a crack-down on the Cosa Nostra clans. While Giuliani's own clampdown in the U.S. won him national acclaim, Falcone was assassinated by Riina’s cohorts in 1992. Riina laid aside his plans for Giuliani after realising that US authorities had the power to destroy the Sicilian mob, website Palermo Today said. Riina was nicknamed 'The Beast' for his violent behavior, and was known for his tendency to target high-profile officials in an attempt to scare them into dropping cases. (He also had a less-frightening title- The short One- based on his height.) Naimo became a member of the Sicilian mafia in 1965 and was thought by police to be its head when he moved to the U.S in 1968. Toto Riina once described him as being 'more powerful than the President of the United States'. It comes as little surprise that Giuliani attracted the attention of the mob as he spent much of the 1980s climbing up the political ladder by way of his legal career. Legal elite: Giuliani pictured during his time as an anti-mafia prosecutor in the 1980s . Crack team: Giuliani pictured in 1987 with his prosecutors (from left to right) John Savarese, Michael Chertoff and Gil Childers in New York . After studying law and clerking for a district judge in New York, he served as an Associate District Attorney General during President Ford's administration and went into a private practice when the Democratic Carter administration came into power. During President Reagan's reign, Giuliani was named an Associate Attorney General which made him the third-highest ranking member of the Justice Department. He returned to his home state of New York in 1983 and launched several high-profile initiatives in the Southern District which oversees Manhattan and the four boroughs. He was known for taking on high-profile cases that ranged from drug dealers and financial corruption but the ones that undoubtedly ruffled feathers within the mafia undoubtedly were his cases against organized crime families. He was one of the most visible lawyers involved with the Mafia Commission Trial that spanned from February 1085 to November 1986 and led to the indictments of 11 major organized crime figures. The alleged hit against Giuliani is not the only surprising revelation to have come out of Italian courts of late, as a separate trial in January unearthed a plot to blow up the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The plot was hatched in 1992, when the Mafia had declared war on the state, embarking on a series of attacks on police and judges, as well as civilian targets such as museums and trains. Supergrass Gioacchino La Barbera told the court in Janurary how convicted terrorist Paolo Bellini suggested the target to his mafia associates, during the years of terror. Bellini, nicknamed The Black Primrose, said that they should stop bombing civilian targets and hit Italy’s artistic treasures instead. The court heard how he persuaded boss Nino Gioe that the impact of such a blast would be more powerful, saying: ‘Just imagine. What if Pisa woke up and the Tower wasn’t there!?’ The explosives that were prepared for the attack were eventually discovered by the police. But the plot was shelved after sweeping arrests in 1993, including Riina, the court was told.","Salvatore 'Toto' Riina allegedly planned a hit on Giuliani in the 1980s .

"Motorists had to be rescued from their cars after thunder storms and torrential rain caused flash floods across the South East early yesterday. One of the driest starts to September on record ended dramatically when sudden downpours flooded parts of Essex during Friday night and yesterday morning, with more than an inch of rain falling in just one hour. Floods of up to 4ft submerged cars in Southend and Witham, and parts of the A12 were blocked, while the rain also caused travel chaos across East London, with Tube stations inundated. In Cambridge, punters escaped the worst but had to shelter under umbrellas or even resort to newspapers, right, for damp-proofing. By contrast, much of the rest of the country enjoyed balmy weather, to the delight of sunbathers in Brighton. Forecasters said fresher conditions are expected today. Scroll down for video .

An ambulance was called to the The Cornucopia pub, Marine Parade to treat the woman who had fractured her shoulder after falling. Crews were also forced to pump out water at the Sealife Centre, draining water until after midnight. Meanwhile the roof of the Pearl Dragon Restaurant collapsed under rain water. But forecasters said the rain was likely to tail off by the end of the day, with fresher conditions expected on Sunday morning. Tony Baker, a forecaster at the Met Office, said: 'Thunderstorms and rain are likely to  rumble on through much of the day in London and the south east but it will gradually drift out to the North Sea. 'There is a risk of showers throughout most of the day, it will be quite overcast and muggy with the rain likely to die out late this afternoon. 'Much of England and Wales and southern Scotland is seeing cloudy, humid weather with spits and spots of rain showers in a few areas.' Mr Baker added the rain was worst in London, but a looming cold front will push clouds out later this afternoon to make way for a clear start tomorrow morning. 'The cold front will push south overnight and leave a cleaner, fresher day tomorrow. The rest of the weekend is certainly a lot better.' Temperatures are expected to reach 22C in parts of the capital, with parts of the north east likely to be as cold as 13C.

On Thursday flash flooding wreaked chaos on travel in parts of London, with commuter services cancelled due to lightning damage on train lines. Lightning damaged equipment between Melksham and Chippenham in Wiltshire, with the lines between Swindon and Bath Spa/Westbury closed. A limited replacement road transport was operating, with disruption expected to last until at least noon. To the east, a lightning strike at Otford in Kent was affecting Thameslink services between Sevenoaks and Kentish Town in London, while Southeastern services between Ashford International and London’s Victoria station via Maidstone East were also affected. Some trains between Sevenoaks and Swanley were diverted and were not calling at stations between Sevenoaks and Bickley. A shuttle service was operating between Maidstone East and Ashford International approximately every 80 minutes between these stations. In Exeter, Devon, lightning knocked out the telephone system at the Devon and Cornwall Police headquarters at Middlemoor. Emergency 999 calls were transferred to Plymouth. Also in Exeter, heavy rain before dawn caused flash flooding and affected roads in the city and outlying areas. In Dawlish, Devon, the fire service were called out to help after half a dozen properties were flooded by heavy rainfall. Thunder and lightning woke many people in East Devon between 5am and 7am as the heavy rain replaced the sunny and dry conditions.

Dozens of rail commuters were stranded throughout the night when their train became submerged in 4ft-deep flash flood water. The 10.45pm service from London Paddington to Swansea stopped near Corsham, Wiltshire, as it struck water at around midnight. Emergency services were called to the scene at 1am but the 90 passengers remained stuck on board until 6am. A fleet of taxis turned up at the site where the stranded commuters were eventually driven home. Passenger Chris Williams took to Twitter to document the journey and the spectacular electrical storms which swept through the area last night. He said: ‘Trapped on First Great Western train outside of Bristol. Multiple lightning strikes and tracks totally submerged in flood water. ‘Well, I didn’t anticipate staying up for the vote. I certainly didn’t foresee being awake sat in the dark on a train surrounded by water. 'Emergency rescue services boarded train. Checking we’re all well. We’re fine but would quite like to be rescued please. 'Generally everyone in good spirits. Just no idea how we’re getting home.’ Problems: First Great Western said the flooding had caused significant disruption to other trains running between Bath Spa and Swindon . It is believed part of the train will be stuck at the scene for several days because some of the ballast holding the track in place has been washed away. Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service crews at the scene said they found 4ft of water on the track when they arrived. First Great Western said the flooding had caused significant disruption to other trains running between Bath Spa and Swindon. It is believed the lines are completely blocked by water - cancelling, delaying or diverting trains. A fire service spokesman said: ‘Shortly after 1am, Network Rail informed Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service control that a train had become stuck in floodwater at Pound Pill in Corsham. ‘Ninety passengers were on the train, which came to a halt in a cutting where water was up to a metre deep in places. A multi-agency response was put in place to resolve the incident. All passengers had been removed from the train by 6am and have been transported home by taxi.'

"With less than 10 months to the next General Election, politicians are keen to make a good impression on the public. If the findings of new research by consultants The Buzzz are anything to go by, they have a lot of work to do. One thousand voters were shown photographs of each main party leader and asked for an instant reaction. Scroll down for video . 'Frustrating', 'disgusting' and 'confusing' - the poll's verdict on  David Cameron (left), Nick Clegg (centre) and Ed Miliband (right) David Cameron frustrated the public, Ed Miliband confused them and Nick Clegg disgusted them. Twenty-nine per cent of potential voters were 'frustrated' by the Prime Minister compared to Nick Clegg who left 24 per cent frustrated and 21 per cent who felt the same way about the leader of the Opposition. Deputy Prime Minister Clegg will be shocked to find that 21 per cent of respondents find him 'disgusting', just ahead of his boss on 20 per cent with Mr Miliband trailing on 10 per cent. None of the three leaders inspired positive thoughts among the polled voters – Ed Miliband's 'net emotional resonance' score was -32. Mr Cameron scored -42. Mr Clegg suffered the worst score of -51. Nigel Farage (with the wine bottle): 'people have conflicting emotions about him' Nigel Farage, the leader of Ukip and possible future MP for South Thanet, did well with 19 per cent of voters being 'intrigued' by him. The final report says: 'Results confirm the apathy and anonymity political leaders engender in the public — the largest proportions said they felt 'nothing' or 'frustrated', even 'disgusted'. 'Nigel Farage is different because people have conflicting emotions about him ... he is five times more intriguing than Cameron and Clegg and twice as intriguing as Miliband. 'The big question is whether people will vote for a politician they find intriguing. Farage stands out from the pack, who appear to be receding into neutrality, which is worrying in a democracy admired around the world.'","Poll of 1,000 voters makes unhappy reading for party leaders .

But as MPs were debating the proposal, Tory MP Conor Burns pointed out that Lord Prescott still parks his blue-grey Jaguar in the car park, even though he became a peer three years ago. However, a spokesman for Lord Prescott – who was known as Two Jags – said he was given a pass to use the car park a year ago due to a surplus of spaces. Reacting to the demand, one furious MP, who described the move as ‘a land-grab like you see in Gaza’, said: ‘They just want to park their Bentleys in an underground car park. ‘They also don’t want their staff to use public transport.’ The peers claim the car park has a surplus of spaces as MPs apparently now prefer to come by public transport.

"Oscar Pistorius admitted he was ‘haunted’ by his ‘dark side’ in a devastating email which was never shown during his murder trial, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. In an emotional six-page message the Paralympian confesses to causing ‘pain and humiliation’ by bombarding an ex-girlfriend with 30 emails and phone calls a day, cheating on her, then keeping ‘secrets and lies’ from her.

"The controversial hike would go ahead despite the Prime Minister's warning that the increase would be 'completely unacceptable' MPs are likely to incur public fury with an inflation-busting ten per cent pay rise next year – an increase supported by the new head of Parliament's expenses watchdog.

Mr Boo said politicians should not be paid a 'miserly amount' for their important job and their salaries needed to 'catch up' with their counterparts overseas. But the proposal is likely to meet with outrage at a time when public sector workers' wage rises have been capped at one per cent. In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, Mr Boo said: 'This is an important job, the job of an MP. They are there to represent us all, to form laws, to send young people to war. It is not an easy thing to do. We want to have good people doing the job and they need to be paid fairly. 'Now, that's not paid in excess but it's not being paid a miserly amount either ... 'It's our job to reach the judgment of what the right amount is. There are lots and lots of professionals in public life and in the private sector who earn a lot more than that - so it is not an excessive amount of money at all.' MPs are already due a one per cent increase to £67,731 next April, and under Ipsa's plan is will rise again a month later to £74,000. The watchdog has said it will conduct one further review of the pay rise after the election - as it is legally obliged to do - but Mr Boo made clear its conclusions were unlikely to shift. 'We were allowing for any change in economic circumstances,' he said. 'At that time we had only just emerged from recession, it wasn't quite clear we were going to have the growth that we have got now as a country, so we left the option open to change the position. 'As of now, September, it doesn't look like there is any major economic factor that would change the determination that we reached in 2013.' He added: 'Parliament as a whole has created an independent body to set MPs' pay. We have gone through the process in a really rigorous way. It is not an arbitrary figure that we have come up with. 'Obviously, it is for parliament to decide whether they want to take back responsibility for setting their own pay. I don't believe that's right. Scroll down for video . MPs are already due a one per cent increase to £67,731 next April, and under Ipsa's plan is will rise again a month later to £74,000 . 'I think we are in a better position as a country now when we have an independent, transparent regulator that is tasked with determining MPs' remuneration. 'This is the number that we've come up with and we talked both to the public and to MPs about it. But if Parliament wants to change its mind and to change our remit then that's clearly for them.' Mr Boo - whose own £120,000 salary is £10,000 more than that of his predecessor - insisted a change in the law would be needed to prevent Ipsa following through on its proposals. Another potential block to the pay rise was removed over the summer, when Ipsa chairman Sir Ian Kennedy was reappointed for another 18 months - meaning he will remain in post after the general election.","Increase is supported by the new head of Parliament's expenses watchdog .

"Furious: The Prime Minister was given a  dressing down by his own MPs including Philip Davies . David Cameron has been given a humiliating dressing-down by his own MPs over the ‘failure’ to get a grip on immigration. The Prime Minister was ‘puce-faced’ as Tory MPs queued up to challenge his record on reducing the flow of immigrants into the UK and demand answers to what he was going to do about it. He was openly contradicted after praising Home Secretary Theresa May for doing a ‘good job’ on the controversial issue. Outspoken Tory backbencher Philip Davies rounded on Mr Cameron, saying: ‘I don’t think she’s done a good job at all!’ The row came at a private meeting of Tory MPs last week, held amid growing chaos in Calais where migrants are mounting increasingly frantic attempts to board cross-Channel ferries or hide in UK-bound vehicles. It also followed new figures casting doubt on Mr Cameron’s stated ambition to cut net migration to below 100,000 by next May. Official statistics show net migration (the difference between those arriving in the UK and those leaving) was 243,000 in the year to March, up nearly 70,000 on the previous year. At the meeting, ex-Minister John Redwood demanded to know ‘what should we now say about our current immigration target?’ And Mr Davies, MP for Shipley in West Yorkshire, made a thinly veiled suggestion that the Prime Minister, MP for well-to-do Witney in Oxfordshire, was out of touch with other parts of the country. He said: ‘I don’t know about Oxfordshire or Surrey, but where I represent there’s a big problem with immigration. This latest set of figures is disastrous. Why can’t you just tell the public that you cannot control immigration while we’re still in the EU?’ Witnesses said Mr Cameron turned ‘a deep shade of puce’ as Mr Davies spoke. Crisis: Increasingly desperate migrants have converged on Calais wanting to cross the Channel via the port . A second North of England MP also challenged the Prime Minister. Brigg and Goole MP Andrew Percy told Mr Cameron that immigration was the ‘number one issue’ for local Tory voters. Number 10 sources last night denied there was a row, adding: ‘These meetings are an important forum to exchange views.’ Meanwhile, former Tory Party leader Michael Howard yesterday warned France that it needed to ‘get its act together’ and deal with asylum seekers in Calais rather than blaming Britain. The party grandee, Home Secretary from 1993-1997 and now Lord Howard, said the mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart, was ‘directing her frustration and her anger at the wrong target’ by demanding that London ‘take responsibility’. Bombshell: The defection of Clacton MP Douglas Carswell (right) has sent ripples through Westminster Tories . ‘The general principle which every member state of the European Union has subscribed to is that refugees, people fleeing persecution, should apply for asylum in the first safe country they reach,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Calais was last night braced for violence as the town prepared for a march today by French nationalists against the migrants. ‘We don’t care where they go but we don’t want them in our country,’ one protester said. Denis Gaudin, Calais sub-prefect, said there was a ‘fraught climate’.","Tories queued up to criticise PM after he said Theresa May did a good job .

"A secret plot to boot John Bercow out of the Commons is being drawn up by senior Tory MPs. They are planning to eject the Speaker from his Buckingham constituency at the next General Election by fielding a ‘proper’ Tory candidate against him. The move would drive a coach and horses through the convention at Westminster that sitting Commons Speakers are never challenged at General Elections by candidates from the three main political parties. But some senior Tories are now so angry over Mr Bercow’s attempt to appoint an ‘unqualified’ Australian to be the new Commons Clerk that they are determined to remove him. 'Beyond a joke': Senior Tories have criticised John Bervow's performance after he attempt to recruit the 'unqualified' Carol Mills (right) as the £200,000-a-year Commons Clerk . One said privately last night: ‘Putting up a Tory candidate against Bercow at the Election may break with convention but frankly, the Speaker’s performance is beyond a joke. ‘This may be the nuclear option but we have to act.’ At the last Election in 2010, former Tory MP Mr Bercow was famously challenged by Ukip leader Nigel Farage in Buckingham, beating him by 14,450 votes. But the Tories, Labour and Liberal Democrats honoured the Commons convention that as Speakers give up their party political affiliations when they take office, they should not face candidates from the main parties at Election time. The secret plans emerged as Mr Bercow faces a Commons’ showdown this week over the controversial decision to propose Australian parliament official Carol Mills to the £200,000-a-year Commons Clerk and Chief Executive post. In a full-scale Commons debate, MPs are set to ask how an interview panel led by Mr Bercow chose Ms Mills to be the Commons’ main constitutional adviser and expert despite claims she had no real experience for that key role. Mr Bercow was last week forced to ‘pause’ the appointment process in the face of protests from MPs who also want to know how Ms Mills was picked when her department in Canberra is undergoing two separate investigations – including one into claims that officials used CCTV to spy on an Australian senator’s office. However, there were fears last night that MPs were under pressure not to ‘rake over’ the details of the panel’s decision and instead focus on whether the Commons’ Clerk role should be split to create a procedural/constitutional adviser post and a separate chief executive to oversee everyday running of Commons’ facilities. At the last Election in 2010, former Tory MP Mr Bercow was famously challenged by Ukip leader Nigel Farage in Buckingham, beating him by 14,450 votes. The fears grew amid signs from the Speaker’s office that Mr Bercow intends to chair this week’s debate, despite private claims from some MPs that it would be ‘completely wrong’ for him to oversee a debate where his conduct could be a key part of the discussions. Last night, Tory MP Michael Fabricant, one of the Speaker’s fiercest critics over the issue, said colleagues had to be able to demand ‘full’ answers over how the nomination had been arrived at. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The Speaker cannot be allowed to walk away from what has been a shambolic and woeful selection procedure, which has not only disrupted the House of Commons and its officers but has also hurt the reputation of the candidates for the job.’ Many MPs insist that David Natzler, deputy to outgoing Commons Clerk Sir Robert Rogers, should have got the job. Last night, allies of the Speaker reacted in fury to the Tory plot to unseat him and insisted Conservative party chiefs would not sanction any such challenge. Tory MP Charles Walker said: ‘Putting a Conservative candidate up against John Bercow would break with a hallowed Commons tradition. Speakers are non-partisan, non-political figures, and although some people may think this is a clever wheeze now, they would come to regret it in the long term.’","Move would go against convention that a sitting speaker isn't challenged .

"Bouncier than a space hopper and smoother than spun silk, there's no doubt the Duchess of Cambridge's hair was a triumph on tour Down Under. And the secret of her swingy, super-glossy 'rich girl hair'? It's rumoured that last year Kate switched allegiances from Richard Ward's salon in Sloane Square to VIP favourite Rossano Ferretti's in London's Fitzrovia. Ferretti is the hairdresser behind Angelina Jolie's amazing locks and his stylists are also said to tend the tresses of Pippa Middleton, and actresses Jennifer Lawrence and Salma Hayek. Here Pol Garcia, Ferretti's artistic director, tells INDIA STURGIS the ten secrets of how to get the 'rich girl' look. Super-glossy: Whether worn up or down, Kate's hair always looked pristine during the recent royal tour of Australia and New Zealand . A good cut is the essential foundation to natural, glossy, highend hair. If you can afford it, 'The Method' is the best haircut in the world. Developed 20 years ago by Rossano Ferretti, today it costs from £120 to £1,000, and takes anything from an hour to almost a whole day. It's about maximising a client's natural beauty by considering how each strand of hair falls. It takes into account the hair's texture, thickness, glossiness, length, colour, cut and density. I trained for two and a half years to master it. First we shampoo and condition, then give a moisturising treatment and head massage. To cut the hair we use patented scissors that were designed by Ferretti and are hand-made in Italy. They have little gaps cut into the bottom blade so most of it is blunt - they cut only 8 per cent of the hair at a time, creating delicate, soft lines for an ultra-feminine look. We use three cutting techniques for 'The Method'. No worries on a windy day: The Duchess' hair always falls into place thanks to the 'the method' cutting technique . One is called 'inserire' (Italian for 'enter'), which involves carving layers into small sections of hair that won't be visible when the cut is finished but add body and movement. Then there's 'uscita' ('exit'), which means slicing fingers through hair to guide the scissors. Lastly there's 'uscita ruotare' ('rotating exit'), which involves turning the hair in your fingers, at a precise angle, for a more accurate cut. Once the cut is finished the hair is blow-dried and styled, though it will look fine if left to air-dry. The two shades rule The closer you keep your hair to its natural colour, the better and glossier it is. Dye it too light or dark and you ruin the follicles, which dry out and break during brushing. Volume: Use vegetable dye for shiny hair like Kate's . This is because stronger chemicals are needed to make more dramatic colour changes. As a rule, ask your hairdresser to go only two shades lighter or darker than your natural hue. Fair complexions can get away with a shade or two lighter than this. The only way to cover grey hair is with permanent colour, but be regimented with its upkeep. Refreshing roots can be necessary every ten days. We don't do hair extensions except by special request. I almost always advise against them. They are so bad for hair, weakening and pulling the follicles and leading to hair damage and loss. Clipped-in extensions (which are cheaper) add less weight and drag marginally less than glue-ins but damage the hair as you take them in and out. At a push, clip-ins are slightly more acceptable for your hair's health - but only as a one-off for a special occasion. With the right cut you should sidestep the need for these altogether, and look naturally classier. If you're considering highlights, ask for balayage (from the French 'to sweep') for extra depth and dimension. These are freestyle, hand-painted highlights which make hair look naturally sun-kissed and need less maintenance than more formulaic highlights (where traditional foiling or a colour cap is used) or solid block colour. They can last for up to four months before needing a touch-up. After washing hair at home, lightly towel dry so it is still 80 per cent wet. This is when it is most manageable and you will be able to see the natural fall, weight and curl of your hair. Drying soaking wet hair takes longer and makes it harder to style. Next, massage a volumising spray, foam or cream in at the roots with your fingers for height and texture. A mousse is best for fine, thin hair. Radial bristle brushes are the softest: they won't pull and achieve bounce, movement and body best under the dryer (Natural bristles radial hairbrush, £7.50, John Lewis). A paddle brush is best if you want straight hair. To finish, mist a spray of hair oil (Davines hair oil, £21.05, salonskincare.co.uk) a short distance from the head while the hair is still damp. No budget buys: Don't skimp on shampoo if you want 'rich girl hair' Heat protection: Be careful of too hot thongs when styling hair and finish with a spray of hair oil . Some things you can skimp on, some you can't. A top-quality shampoo and conditioner is essential for luxurious, glossy locks. Unfortunately, supermarket own brands tend to turn hair ashen, with ingredients such as sulfates and sodium chloride stripping protective oils from the hair. The best shampoo and conditioner comes from the Shu Uemura sleek smoothing range (£19, lookfantastic.com), which delivers the best shine and volume I've ever come across. Leave conditioner on for as long as possible so the maximum amount of protein - the natural building blocks of hair - can be absorbed to moisturise and smoothe. Leaving conditioner on for ten minutes is vital if you have coloured or thinning hair, as it helps to boost volume and shape. Another trick is to shampoo, condition, then very lightly shampoo again to remove product build-up. This improves fine hair, which gets easily weighed down with conditioning masks and will look brighter and bouncier after drying. Spring-clean your hair with a vegetable dye. These are natural colourants that aren't permanent. They are richly conditioning, coating each strand like a varnish rather than penetrating the cuticle. They will temporarily thicken the hair, adding volume and bounce and boosting shine. The colour will fade over time but they are a good quick fix, and results can last for up to six shampoos. It's tasty too! Prince George also approves of his mother's long hair . We often use a moisturising hair mask on clients before cutting. A reviving hair treatment you can do at home i s Kérastase Chronologiste, which comes with little 'caviar' pearls for massaging into the scalp and a conditioning mask full of vitamin A and E, for stimulating hair growth and moisturising the scalp. Leave it on for 15 minutes after shampooing, then rinse for glossy hair and a nourished, hydrated scalp (£64, vesira.com, one kit contains ten applications). Your tongs, straighteners and curlers heat up to a maximum of 220c. That's hotter than you roast a chicken at, so think what it's doing to your hair! Look on the packaging to see how hot your gadgets can get. Ideally set them to a medium heat setting - say, 180c - and use tongs sparingly. The thicker and coarser your hair, the higher temperature you'll need. Protect hair before styling with a product such as Aveda Brilliant Damage Control (£16.50, aveda.co. uk). This is essential whatever your hair type.","Kate's hair was a triumph on recent tour Down Under .
So what's her secret?"
"There was never any question over what Claire Rumble would call her daughter when she was born last month. It was always going to be Rosie, the name of the specialist nurse who looked after her big brother Louis during his three-and-half year battle with leukaemia. 'Deciding on the name was easy,' explains Claire. 'My husband James and I have never met anyone like Rosie — it was a tiny gesture of thanks for everything she’s done.' Three months earlier, five-year-old Louis had finally finished his treatment and was declared cancer-free. Heroic: Nurse Rosie Chisnell (right) has been nominated for a Health Hero Award by Claire Rumble (left) But it was the empathy and the many extra hours Rosie Chisnell put in helping the anxious family along their journey that has earned her a nomination for the Daily Mail Health Hero award. 'Other nurses clock in and off, Rosie is a constant. There’s no one else like her,' says Claire, a 34-year-old accountant. The family, who live in Hemel Hempstead, in Hertfordshire, first met Rosie in September 2009,  after a terrifying five days when Louis became suddenly and desperately ill. 'One day he was fine, playing with his twin sister Grace, then suddenly he stopped eating, was pale, exhausted and crying through the night for no apparent reason,' recalls Claire. 'When angry purple bruises appeared all over his body we rushed him to hospital.'' Just 12 hours after a barrage of tests at Watford General Hospital doctors revealed the shocking diagnosis: the 19-month-old had leukaemia. 'You can’t imagine  what being told your son has cancer feels like,' says Claire. 'The world just stops.' As the hospital’s paediatric oncology nurse, Rosie, 56, was there at the diagnosis. 'For the next two hours Rosie sat with us explaining everything in great depth, fielding our questions and laying everything out clearly and honestly. 'I remember asking her whether Louis was going to die and she said: ""His condition is fully treatable."" She couldn’t say no, but she has a natural way of reassuring you. It wasn’t until later that I realised her shift had actually finished at 5pm, six hours earlier. She’d stayed to help us.' It was just the first of many such gestures that demonstrated Rosie’s extraordinary dedication to her young patients. 'Rosie would often call us at 9pm, hours after she should have left, with Louis’s blood results. We’d say: ""What are you doing, go home,"" but she’d just laugh and say  she had a list of patients she needed to call.' Tragic: Cancer takes a particularly grim toll on children who find chemotherapy extremely hard . Support: Sick children, such as this little girl at Great Ormond Street hospital, need extra care . From day one the Rumble family had her mobile number. 'Children aren’t ill nine to five, Monday to Friday,' explains Rosie. 'I would hate to think something might happen and a family couldn’t get hold of me.' Claire and James, a 37-year-old aircraft engineer, frequently had to call Rosie late at night when Louis developed croup — a fierce barking cough — because of his weak immune system. 'I’d be beside myself, worrying whether he needed to be rushed into hospital or not. Knowing she was there, a phone call away, was a huge emotional support and stopped me flying into a blind panic.' Once Louis accidentally pulled out his nasogastric tube — a tube inserted via the nose into the stomach to administer medication. Unfortunately, it was on a weekend when Rosie wasn’t working, but she knew putting it back would be a traumatic experience for a child, so dropped everything and drove the 40 minutes from home to the hospital to do the procedure herself. 'I just couldn’t believe it. You don’t expect a nurse to do things like that, especially on their weekend off,' says Claire. 'We knew we had someone special in our corner.' In February 2010, Louis developed an infection which meant he had to go to hospital twice a day for antibiotic treatment until it cleared. For a child so young, it was a horrible experience: 'I’d lift him, asleep, from his cot and he’d start crying pleading: ‘No go, Mummy, no go.’ It was heart breaking.' The next day Rosie called to say not to take Louis to hospital as she was coming to their house with the equipment to teach Claire how to administer the intravenous antibiotics at home. 'I couldn’t believe anyone could be so kind. She arrived with a great crate of equipment and stayed until almost midnight, showing me exactly how it all worked; the pump, the syringes, everything. 'Louis’s face lights up when he sees her and when he was in hospital if he heard her heels click-clacking down the corridor he would sit up in bed. 'She’d chase him around the ward on hands and knees, despite her dress and heels (she doesn’t ‘do’ trousers) and treat him with such care and affection, explaining everything so he wouldn’t be scared. Health Hero: Do you know any heroic healthcare workers who deserve an award? Make your nomination below . 'Postman Pat would always be put on the TV when she was taking blood samples and she’d administer a bowl of Cheerios, another favourite, if he wasn’t eating. 'Whatever Rosie said, Louis would do. Grace, as his twin, could have felt left out but Rosie included her in everything, even letting her occasionally stay overnight in hospital with him as a sleepover. 'For a parent, you can’t underestimate the impact of having someone like Rosie around. I’d have spent days stewing over Louis’s health, endlessly worrying, but Rosie being just a phone call away meant I was less anxious and felt more in control. She helped me and James to focus on the practicalities of his treatment and be better parents.' So what drives this kind of dedication? 'It’s the children,' Rosie explains. 'They’re a model to us all. They just get on with it, the good and the bad. If I can improve their lives, or their families, even a bit, I’m happy. 'I know in this job I can make a difference. I’ve always loved children and got on with them easily and even as a little girl knew I wanted to be a nurse.' Rosie, who is married to Ian, a solicitor, never had children of her own, a conscious decision because of her career. 'Ian and I both work very hard. I’ve trained and worked in healthcare, specialising in paediatrics since I was 19. I have a wonderful niece, two nephews and lots of children at the hospital to keep  me busy.' Rosie is adamant that she wouldn’t be able to provide such high standards of care without the help of her colleagues. 'I couldn’t be nearly so flexible without a strong team behind me.' One member of that team is Vasanta Nanduri, a consultant paediatric oncologist who has worked with Rosie for the last 18 years. She says: 'She’s my right hand, a great friend with far too much energy and someone I trust implicitly. 'But it’s her knowledge and dedication to the children which is so impressive. She works out of hours, late into the night. She rarely takes a holiday, even though we try to make her. If she does, she writes 50-page handover notes. She’s a real inspiration. Everyone on the ward looks up to her.' Sentiments echoed by Claire. 'It will be a sad day when Rosie retires and I feel sorry for the families who won’t get to meet her. We felt lucky every day that she was around and now we’ll always be reminded of her kindness by baby Rosie.' For more information go to childrenwithcancer.org.uk . Do you know a health hero?

"Asylum seekers in Calais have threatened to burn themselves alive if they are not let into Britain. The 25 refugees have vowed to make desperate and horrific gesture in the town’s main shopping street unless the French and British governments meet a list of demands. They are among 35 asylum seekers who have been on hunger strike since June 12 in a protest camp near the main ferry port. 'Rights for migrants without ID documents': People hold a banner during a protest outside the Pas-de-Calais administrative centre in Lille in solidarity with stranded migrants in the port of Calais . They are demanding that refugees who want to cross the Channel are given legal status in Britain, and those that wish to remain in France are granted legal status there. And they are asking for safe accommodation and an end to police brutality in Calais until a deal between the UK and France on their fate is reached. One 40-year-old Afghan asylum seeker named John Abdullah told French media: 'We are tired of life. We want human rights. We want the British and French governments to think about us, but nobody cares. 'We no longer want to live like animals': Migrants have sent a letter to Denis Robin, Prefect of Pas-de-Calais, demanding proper accommodation . 'All 25 of us have decided that if . they do not listen, we will kill ourselves. We will go to the high . street, throw petrol and set ourselves on fire.' The protesters are among the 300 or so migrants whose camp site made of cardboard and bin bags was bulldozed last month by police amid claims it was infested with scabies. Since then, many of them have been sleeping in the meal distribution centre in Calais. In a joint letter to Calais prefect Denis Robin this month, they wrote: 'We no longer want to live like animals, but as normal human beings in dignified conditions, whether or not we have identity papers. 'We want roofs over our heads, decent hygiene conditions, three meals a day and an end to police controls, while talks resume between the UK and France regarding our final destination.' Calais migrant aid worker Cecile Bossy said: 'Everyone wants to find a solution to this extremely complex problem. 'Right now, the main issue is finding them somewhere they can be sheltered.' Calais police have said they are working with local aid organisations to monitor the ongoing hunger strike and the threat by the 25 to set themselves on fire. A Calais police spokesman said: 'We absolutely can not let them burn themselves alive. We are doing everything in our power to prevent this from ever happening.' Police: Gendarmes search the shelters of asylum seekers in their camp at Calais last month, shortly before bringing in bulldozers to flatten the camps amid claims that the camp was the centre of an outbreak of scabies . Large numbers of migrants have been living rough in Calais since the Sangatte hostel was bulldozed in 2002. There are believed to be around 1,000 refugees currently along the northern French coast, with around 650 near the port where they try to sneak aboard ferries and lorries bound for Dover. Since police bulldozed their camp last month, many have also moved to smaller ports in Normandy and Brittany in their attempts to reach Britain. Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart recently blamed the UK’s ‘generous’ state benefits for refugees for the camps in her town. She said: 'Calais is a hostage to the British. That’s enough. It’s no longer tenable. It’s necessary to renegotiate these accords. We’re not here to do their job.'","Refugees also demand proper housing until their status can be decided .

"He was less than chiselled as Matthew Crawley in Downton Abbey. But four hours a day of workouts  and a virtually vegan diet transformed Dan Stevens into the trim hunk seen in his new film The Guest. ‘It was hard work and I had to change my metabolism,’ says Dan, 31. He tackled gym circuits  and weights in the morning and martial arts in the afternoon, with a trip to the gun range at lunchtime. Changing it up: Dan Stevens has undergone a complete body overhaul for his new film, left, and is looking quite different from his days on Downton Abbey . ‘The martial arts is very interesting. It’s about discipline and a focus which enables a certain change to take place,’ he says. ‘I’m more aware of what I’m putting into my body. I worked with a nutritionist who’d worked with other actors for this sort of physical preparation. 'It’s about an awareness of what you’re eating rather than having a particular diet. We all metabolise things differently and respond to different forms of exercise.’ Careful with the pressure: Alex may need to calm the campaign following new research . In the last days of campaigning ahead of this Thursday’s Scottish referendum vote, Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling should take heed of a new study that has revealed stressing out voters can directly affect turnout. Scientists found that people with high levels of the stress hormone cortisol are less inclined to put a cross in the box. The study, published in Physiology  And Behavior, found that cortisol played a role in people’s willingness to vote. Researchers at the University of Nebraska collected saliva samples from  105 volunteers who were either highly conservative or highly liberal. Saliva was collected before and after an afternoon of activities designed to both increase and lower stress. Levels of cortisol were measured, as well as voting behaviour in six elections. The researchers believe political participation is highly stressful and therefore those with a lower cortisol level would be more likely to vote. Fish and chips are getting healthier.  In March, LoSalt offered interested  fish-and-chip shops 3kg of their low-sodium salt as well as shakers with fewer holes so that less salt is dispensed. This means customers eat 66 per cent less sodium. A bag of chips may contain 3.9g of salt, almost two-thirds of the recommended daily intake. So far, 400 fish-and-chip shops nationwide have signed up to the initiative. But as there are 10,000 chippies in the UK, this is still a drop in the ocean. See losalt.com/uk/golo for your nearest participating chip shop. The healing powers of electromagnetic therapy have been given added credence by a new trial into the effects of the home-use product ActiPatch – which delivers low-level,  safe electromagnetic pulses to provide pain relief. The placebo-based double-blind study  looked at 154 patients with knee pain. Significant improvements were shown in three important measures associated with osteoarthritis: pain, ease of movement and quality of life. Seventy-eight per cent experienced benefits, and pain reduction was over 50 per cent. How does it work? Blood flow in the body is regulated by electric signals that travel along nerves. Electromagnetic therapy modifies the nerve signals, providing pain relief by enhancing blood flow, thus reducing inflammation and stimulating healing.","Actor Dan Stevens has given himself a body overhaul for new film .

"Migrants in the French port of Calais have gone on hunger strike demanding to be let into Britain. Around 35 refugees from Afghanistan and Egypt have vowed to refuse food until a list of demands issued to Calais officials is met. The hunger strikers are being backed by around 260 more migrants all calling for the French and British authorities to resume talks aimed at allowing them to move legally to Britain. Migrants in the French port of Calais have gone on hunger strike demanding to be let into Britain. Pictured is the remains of a camp in Calais where migrants were told to get out of the centre of or face arrest last month . Their other demands include houses with toilets and showers to live in while they are stranded in Calais, three meals a day and freedom from police controls and evictions. One aid worker said some migrants had threatened to sew their lips together until their demands are met. He added: 'We urged them not to do that, but to eat instead.' The same demands were made in an open letter to Calais prefect Denis Robin last week, after French riot police bulldozed a squalid refugee campsite in the town this month claiming it was infested with scabies. Since then around 300 of them have been sleeping in the meal distribution centre in Calais . Their letter to Mr Robin said: 'We no longer want to live like animals, but as normal human beings in dignified conditions, whether or not we have identity papers. Migrants and activists scuffle with police officers after French authorities started to clear out makeshift camps in Calais, on Wednesday, May 28 . 'We want roofs over our heads, decent hygiene conditions, three meals a day and an end to police controls, while talks resume between the UK and France regarding our final destination.' Calais migrant aid worker Cecile Bossy said: 'Everyone wants to find a solution to this extremely complex problem. 'Right now, the main issue is finding them somewhere they can be sheltered.' Calais police said they would meet with local aid organisations this week to monitor the ongoing hunger strike situation. Large numbers of migrants have been living rough in Calais since the Sangatte hostel was bulldozed in 2002. Gendarmes search the shelters of migrants in a camp at Calais on May 28. Around 35 refugees from Afghanistan and Egypt have now vowed to refuse food until a list of demands issued to Calais officials is met . There are believed to be around 1,000 refugees currently along the northern French coast, with around 650 near the port where they hope to sneak aboard ferries and lorries bound for Dover. Migrants are frequently killed in desperate attempts to smuggle themselves across the English Channel on lorries or buses. Last week a Sudanese teenager died after being crushed under a British tour bus that he’d clung to in an effort to reach England. Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart recently blamed the UK’s ‘generous’ state benefits for refugees for the camps in her town. She said: 'Calais is a hostage to the British. That’s enough. It’s no longer tenable. It’s necessary to renegotiate these accords. We’re not here to do their job.'","Around 35 refugees from Afghanistan and Egypt vowed to refuse food .

"Cunning: The blood-thirsty jungle cat  is said to lie in wait for inebriated drinkers to totter by before pouncing, tearing them to pieces and eating their flesh (stock image) A man-eating leopard is terrorising villagers in a remote part of India by only attacking men as they stumble home drunk - and has claimed at least 12 human lives in two years, villagers say. The blood-thirsty jungle cat has become infamous across the Didihat region of the Himalayas, in northern India, where it is said to lie in wait for inebriated drinkers  to totter by before pouncing, tearing them to pieces and eating their flesh. It has cast such fear across the region that local officials have dispatched an elite team of sharpshooters to hunt and kill the beast. But their efforts have so far drawn a blank. And, last month, the leopard again resurfaced to claim its twelfth victim, a 44-year-old man from Badeth village. The animal's reign of terror has provoked such fear across the region that residents of more than 50 villages are refusing to go outdoors after sundown. Madan Paneru, from Kotali village, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Villagers are terrorised by the wild animals and it's almost impossible to venture out after dark. Moving from one village to another or to markets through forested area becomes difficult. 'People carry sticks with them and remain alert all the time. Many in the village believe that drunk people are easy prey for the wild.' Armed hunters have repeatedly been dispatched by the Uttarakhand Forest Department to kill the beast before it causes any more deaths, but  thus far without luck. Pithoragarh's District Forest Officer Y.K. Singh said: 'This month we had sent a team of shooters in the affected village, but they were unsuccessful in their mission. 'This is the third attempt made so far'. The beast began its killing spree in January 2012, when it attacked a 46-year-old man from the Simar village. It went on to slay five more victims before that year was out, and five more in 2013. Already this year it has killed two people, including the 44-year-old man from Badeth village on August 1. Gripped by fear: The animal's reign of terror has provoked such fear across the Didihat region of the Himalayas (pictured), northern India, that residents of more than 50 villages are refusing to go outdoors after sundown . Wildlife expert Lakhpat Rawat said: 'After the forest department issued the warrant, I visited some of the affected areas in Didihat. We even spotted the animal, but failed to shoot it down. 'The leopard is old and possibly without canines and it appears he has developed a taste for the human flesh. The animal is even consuming intestines, which is a surprising aspect'. But Belinda Wright, leading conservationist and head of the Wildlife Protection Society of India, cast doubt on the claims that the leopard was specifically targeting drunks. ""Quite frankly when people are drunk and weave their way back home to the village they are easy prey,' she said. 'I don't think the leopard is targeting drunk people, just people stumbling along the path at night.' She added: 'I'm sure you won't taste any better because you've consumed liquor.' The hunt continues.","The leopard has terrorised Didihat region of north India since January 2012 .

"A British chef has died after inhaling a lethal dose of laughing gas at his home it France, it was revealed today. Jordan Guise, 21, was found dead at his flat in Beziers, south west France, after experimenting with nitrous oxide - a legal high used as an anaesthetic and an aerosol propellant. His body was found by the boss of the La Charniere restaurant where he was head chef, after he failed to turn up for work. Tragedy: Jordan Guise, 21, was found dead at his . flat in Beziers, south west France, after taking a lethal dose of legal high nitrous oxide, also known as . laughing gas . A verdict of accidental death had now been recorded by a French coroner after the tragedy on February 6, a French judicial spokesman confirmed. His family from Kidderminster, West Midlands, said Jordan has recently discovered he and his girlfriend were expecting their first baby in September. His mother Leesa Malpas said Jordan had called just two days before his death to say he was due to become a father. She told their local paper the Halesowen News: ‘We were laughing and joking with him. He phoned and told us on the Tuesday and died on the Thursday. ‘Jordan didn't turn up for work on Thursday so Jordan's boss went round and found him in his flat. We do know that he died painlessly. He was very relaxed. The chef, originally from Kidderminster, West Midlands, had just told his family his girlfriend was pregnant . Mr Guise had just been named head chef at this British-French restaurant in Beziers when he died . ‘The cause of Jordan's sudden demise is ironic - it was a substance that is freely available and a legal high - laughing gas - that actually took his life.’ ‘Jordan loved his new life and career and although away from friends and family was determined to make something of himself. Jordan moved to work in France after training as a chef at The Granary Hotel restaurant in Shenstone. Ms Malpas added: ‘He lived his dream - to be a head chef in France. He was passionate about his work and was very proud of himself, as were his family, friends and work colleagues.’ The mother of his unborn baby had now moved back to England, and a Facebook page had now been set up to raise the 3,500 pounds needed to return his body to Britain, his father Michael Guise said. An inquest in England has been opened and adjourned.","Jordan Guise, 21, was found dead at his flat in Beziers, south west France .

"France is considering a ban on electronic cigarettes from public places and subject them to the same tight controls as tobacco, the government has announced. The move has sparked outrage among sellers and users of the battery-powered devices which contain liquid nicotine that is turned into a vapor when inhaled. Health Minister Marisol Touraine also wants unbranded cigarette packaging, covered with at least 65 per cent health warnings. France's health minister has proposed a ban on smoking e-cigarettes in public places . And Ms Touraine intends to give smokers the right to seek hefty damage settlements from tobacco companies, similar to billion-dollar class action lawsuits in the U.S. The minister, who intends to put her bill before parliament within weeks, said: 'The e-cigarette is not an ordinary product. We need to apply the same measures as there are for tobacco. 'That means making sure it cannot be smoked in public places, that its sale is restricted to over 18s and that firms are not allowed to advertise the products.' Under French law, e-cigarettes are currently legal to use in bars, restaurants and other public places where traditional smoking has been banned for five years. A ban would harm the booming e-cigarette industry in France, where around 500,000 people use the gadgets, vendors insist. Darren Moon, the English owner of online store Vapshop.fr, said: 'If they ban it in public or in the workplace, I'll be closing my store, or moving it somewhere where there aren't restrictions like that. E-cigarette users will no longer be able to inhale the nicotine vapour if a proposed new bill in France is passed . 'Twenty per cent of our business is selling disposable e-cigarettes to restaurants, clubs, bars and hotels. So if there's a workplace ban, I'd have to start firing people.' E-cigarettes were invented in China in 2003, as many nations began imposing bans on smoking, and are aimed at giving the user a similar sensation to smoking a cigarette. They were thought to be much healthier than normal smoking is because they do not contain the tobacco and other carcinogens found in cigarettes. But many experts have since expressed concerns about certain chemicals contained in the liquid, notably the compound propylene glycol. In May 2011, the French health agency AFSSAPS advised against using the  devices, saying they still contained nicotine, which even at a low concentration could lead to 'damaging side effects'. But other scientists have hit back against the report claiming it is scaremongering. Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos, a cardiology researcher at University Hospital Gathuisberg in Belgium, said: 'Findings such as these should always be compared to the risks of smoking ordinary cigarettes. 'There are also many experts who believe smoking e-cigarettes is many times less dangerous than the real thing.' A group . of leading health experts have claimed e-cigarettes could save millions . of lives and should not be classed as a tobacco product. In a letter published yesterday, ,more than 50 researchers and specialists . from around the globe signed a letter stating that e-cigarettes . have the potential to save millions of lives. The letter urges health officials to . consider the health consequences of such a move, amid fears e-cigarettes . will become harder to obtain. As a result, they should not be regulated in the same way as conventional cigarettes, they say. The signatories include the leading . smoking cessation psychologist Professor Robert West, from University . College London, and experts who have advised the National Institute for . Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on its guidelines about reducing the . harm from tobacco. Various bans on e-cigarettes are in place in several countries around the world. The countries currently with restrictions are Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Brunai, Colombia, Indonesia, Jordan, Malaysia, Mexico, Oman, Panama, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the UAE, Uruguay and Venezuela. In the U.S, New York and Chicago have also banned the cigarettes from public places. Regulations were changed mean they now fall under the same set of rules as tobacco cigarettes. Louisiana has also banned e-cigarette sales to minors. In the UK, the use of e-cigarettes in public places in England is not outlawed, but plans being considered by Public Health England show proposals could be drafted to ban the devices from offices and other public spaces. The minutes from one of the organisation's meetings reveal concerns that they could 'renormalise smoking'. It has also been reported the British Medical Association now wants them included in the smoking ban. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon and some train operators have already banned the devices. Leaked documents have also suggested all electronic cigarettes that are currently on sale in Britain would be banned and removed from the shop shelves under new European Union proposals. In November, The Daily Telegraph reported that Brussels officials fear that there is a 'risk that electronic . cigarettes can develop into a gateway to normal cigarettes'.","The move has sparked outrage among sellers and users .

Sister Marie-Daniel, 86, and Sister Saint-Denis, 82, fled their South of France nunnery after learning they were being sent to a remote mountain retreat 250 miles away. The pair were found several days later. Last year an 82-year-old man escaped from a hospital geriatric ward in Eastern France through an air shaft. A search and rescue dog later picked up his scent after he had been missing for a day.","Pensioner plunged to his death at the home in Darnetal, northern France .

"Created: . 07:50 EST, 29 May 2014 . French students have built a car that can travel almost 25,000 miles - the distance around the equator - on just twelve litres of fuel. The carbon fibre Microjoule, which weighs just 35kg, could cover the 200 mile (320 km) journey between London and Manchester for just 12p (20 cents). The superlight vehicle was the winner of the Shell European Eco-Marathon contest to find the world's most fuel efficient vehicle. Scroll down for video . French students have built a car that can travel almost 25,000 miles - the distance around the equator - on twelve litres of fuel. The carbon fibre Microjoule, which weighs just 35kg, could cover the 200 mile (320 km) journey between London and Manchester for just 12p (20 cents) After testing on a track, judges at the event in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, calculated the car could do 2,072 miles (3,330 km) per litre - the equivalent of 9,400 miles (15,100) per gallon. The cost of driving 24,901 miles around the world's widest point would be just £15.60 ($26). The Microjolie was built by students at the La Joliverie College, in Nantes, western France, who beat 200 other teams competing at this week's event. The car achieves its incredible fuel efficiency through a combination of low rolling resistance and air resistance and a very low drag coefficient - or how it passes through the surrounding air. For example, when you spin the wheels, they will turn for several minutes without ever stopping . Driving 24,901 miles around the world's widest point would cost just £15.60 ($26), according to the judges . A student who worked on the Microjoule project said: 'The car has an internal combustion engine and runs on ordinary fuel. The car weighs 35kg (77lb), over 33 times lighter than an average family car in Europe. The chassis is built from carbon fibre, which is lightweight and strong. The shape resembles a drop of water. The nose area is 3.3 feet sq (0.3m sq) for better aerodynamics. The car is designed to run on either petrol or ethanol. The minimum weight for a driver is 50 kg (110 lbs).

It offers very low rolling resistance and air resistance, and a very, very low drag coefficient. 'For example, when you spin the wheels, they will turn for several minutes without ever stopping.' Students of the Hogeschool van Amsterdam also set a circuit record with a score of 266 miles (428.5 kilometres) per kilowatt hour with their vehicle H2A. If they could drive around the world at the equator, that road trip would cost them no more than £16 ($27) in electricity bills. Meanwhile, France emerged triumphant in the Urban Concept category, where vehicles are much closer to what may ultimately be seen on public roads.

"Easyjet has been fined £42,000 for ordering a disabled French woman to leave a plane because they deemed her a 'security risk'. Wheelchair-bound Marie-Patricia Hoarau, 41, said the British airline made her feel like a 'social outcast' when they forced her off the flight because she was flying alone. The budget carrier was ordered to pay a £4,500 fine by a Paris court last year, but an appeals court increased it by almost ten times on Tuesday after EasyJet challenged the ruling. 'Social outcast': Marie-Patricia Hoarau, 41, was forced off a 2010 Easyjet flight from Paris to Nice because she did not have a 'helper' (stock image) Ms Hoarau, a paraplegic since a cycling accident 20 years ago, told the court how she was allowed to travel unaccompanied on her outbound flight from Nice to Paris in March 2010. But when she boarded the plane to return to Nice, she was ordered back to the check-in desk because she did not have a 'helper'. A fellow passenger offered to take on the role, but cabin crew refused because they had not checked in together. She was taken off the plane and given a free ticket on the next flight, while check-in staff found another passenger willing to accompany her. Ms Hoarau said: ‘I was allowed to board the plane alone, but once I was inside, they told me I couldn't travel because I didn't have a helper. ‘I try to cope with this disability every day and being ordered off like that in front of my fellow passengers was a slap in the face. I felt humiliated and like a pariah who has no place in society.’ EasyJet was initially ordered to pay a £4,500 fine, but an appeals court increased it by almost ten times on Tuesday after the airline challenged the ruling . She added: ‘I am still waiting for a personal apology from EasyJet. ‘Their boss said he was sorry for my unpleasant experience, but only in a press release. I received no phone call from them.’ France's disabled rights association the APF said after Tuesday's ruling: ‘We are pleased at this exemplary sentence against Easyjet for discriminating against this woman because of her handicap.’ The case is one of two brought by wheelchair users against Easyjet in Paris courts. The second case involves another wheelchair user who turned away from a flight from Paris to Portugal because she was travelling alone. Easyjet's French director Francois Bacchetta after Miss Hoarau launched her legal action: ‘I understand her feelings but we must respect very strict safety regulations. ‘In the event of an emergency, we need to be able to evacuate all passengers in 90 seconds. ‘When a disabled passenger checks in alone, we try to find them a helper but we prefer for this to be done at the check-in.’ In January 2012, Easyjet was also fined for refusing to allow three paraplegic passengers aboard flights in Paris in 2008 and 2009. The French transport ministry said after that ruling: ‘EasyJet cannot hide behind safety regulations for refusing to board passengers who have difficulty moving around.’","Marie-Patricia Hoarau, 41, forced off EasyJet flight for flying alone .

"Spanish men also topped the infidelity league in six European countries . The French and Italians are most likely to cheat on their partners - while the British are among the most faithful in Europe, a new poll has revealed. More than half of French and Italian men, and a third of their women, have admitted to being unfaithful while in a relationship, the study showed. Spanish men also topped the infidelity league in six European countries, but Spanish women were among the most faithful, the poll by Ifop for cheating website Gleeden found. The French and Italians are most likely to cheat on their partners - while the British are among the most faithful in Europe, a new poll has revealed . In Britain, 40 per cent of men and a quarter of women admitted to cheating, compared to 45 per cent of men and 42 per cent of women in Germany, and half of all men and one in three women in Belgium. The study also found more than a third of all French people would be prepared to cheat if they were sure they wouldn't get caught. This compares to 25 per cent of British people polled, 31 percent of Germans, 30 per cent of Belgians and Spanish and 28 per cent of Italians. Around half of British respondents who admitted cheating say they regretted the act, where as only around a third of other nations polled said they felt any remorse. A spokesman for Ifop said: ""We can without doubt see the trace of Anglo-Saxon puritanism that permeates British society in terms of its moral morals and sexuality. More than half of French and Italian men, and a third of their women, have admitted to being unfaithful while in a relationship, the study showed . 'There appears to be evidence that suggests infidelity is more common in Latin and Catholic countries, and less so in Protestant countries.' The poll comes after French president Francois Hollande was caught cheating on his partner with glamorous actress Julie Gayet last month. After the scandal erupted in January, his personal approval rating leapt to 31 per cent, up from 26 per cent in October. The figures support a separate 2013 study by the Pew Research Center which found that the French were among the world's least offended by infidelity. Around 53 per cent of French people reported last year that infidelity was morally acceptable, compared to 45 of the British, 40 per cent of Germans, 36 per cent of Spanish, 35 per cent of Italians and 16 per cent of Americans.","Half of French and Italian men, and third of women, admitted to cheating .

"Skype murder: Ammaz Qureshi, 35, is on trial charged with the killing of a one-year-old in Norway . A British accountant has gone on trial accused of murdering a toddler on Skype from 1,100 miles away. Ammaz Qureshi, 35, is said to have told the baby's mother, 28-year-old Yasmin Chaudhry, to submerge her one-year-old daughter in a bucket of water after the child interrupted their online chat. The pair both went on trial in Oslo charged with premeditated murder and assault. Married accountant Qureshi, of Pinner, north London, was introduced to Chaudhry by her brother in London in February 2010. After she returned to Oslo two months later, they continued their relationship by text and over the Internet. During months of online chats, Qureshi encouraged Chaudhry to abuse her daughter by forcing her to eat chili powder and bind her arms and legs with rope as he watched on Skype, it is alleged. When the infant began crying during one conversation in October 2010, Qureshi is said to have told Chaudhry to hold the baby's head in a bucket of water as 'discipline'. After being held underwater twice, the child lost consciousness and the mother called emergency services, but the girl died in hospital the next day. Oslo District Attorney Cecilie Schlosser Moller told Norway's TV2 before the trial: 'She was subjected to physical violence during disciplining. 'In the end, it went too far and she died. 'By submerging the girl in the bucket, they would have anticipated her death. She was a small, defenceless girl who was subjected to extensive abuse.' Qureshi has been in custody in Oslo for more than a year, following his extradition to Norway. He and Chaudhry both deny murder, but the mother has pleaded guilty to abusing her child. Accusations: District Attorney Cecilie Schløsser Møller says Qureshi 'anticipated' the little girl's death . Control: Qureshi is accused of masterminding months of abuse against the child before her death in October 2010, as he stayed in touch with his mistress via online chats and texts . Qureshi, 35, is said to have told the baby's mother, 28-year-old Yasmin Chaudhry, to submerge her one-year-old daughter in a bucket of water after the child interrupted their Skype chat . She blames Qureshi - who is not the child's father - for the child's death by telling her to submerge her daughter in water. Qureshi's lawyer Vibeke Hein Baera told the court: 'He denies the accusations of premeditated murder and assault. 'My . client is baffled that he is accused of a crime committed in a country . which he - at that point in time - had never set foot in.' The trial at the Oslo District Court continues.

"The crew of a British ferry which crashed into a fishing boat while they were 'chatting about Halle Berry' have been found guilty of manslaughter in France. Tapes from the bridge of the catamaran Condor Vitesse revealed Captain Paul Le Romancer and first mate Yves Tournon were discussing the actress's 'sexy outfit' in Catwoman when their 285-ft vessel ploughed in the French trawler in thick fog. The 45mph collision split the 30-ft fishing boat Les Marquises in half, killing captain Philippe Lesaulnier, a 42-year-old father of four. The boat's two other crew members were fished out of the sea unharmed. Sentenced: French crew Paul Le Romancer (L), 58, and his first mate Yves Tournon, 48, were handed suspended sentences and fines after the ferry they were commanding collided with a fishing vessel killing its captain . Distracted: The trial heard how the two Frenchmen were talking about Halle Berry in a 'sexy outfit' as Catwoman, and drug testing as they travelled at 45mph in fog with 200 passengers on board . Le Romancer, 59, was handed an 18-month suspended sentence and first mate Tournon, 48, a 12-month suspended sentence by a court in the Normandy town of Coutances on Wednesday. The trial heard that an investigation by France's BEA maritime authority found the pair had been having an 'almost-continuous conversations unconnected with the operations of the vessel'. At the time of the collision, there were 200 passengers on board the vessel owned by Britain's Condor Ferries, which was crossing from the French port of St Malo to Jersey on the night of March 28, 2011. A recording of the conversation on the bridge moments before the disaster reveals Le Romancer saying of the 2004 film: 'Last night I watched Catwoman on television. I'm an idiot because after that I didn't sleep well. Tournon replied: 'Catwoman?' British company Condor Ferries was not prosecuted after the collision in which one of its ferries sliced through a fishing boat killing its captain . Fishing trawler Les Marquises was sliced in half by the Condor Vitesse after the crew failed to detect it . The trial heard how Captain Lesaulnier was killed; two other fishermen were rescued form the water and survived . The captain answers: 'She was jumping everywhere like a cat. She's bloody beautiful. She was wearing a sexy outfit.' The conversation later turned to how long certain drugs would remain present in the body and jokes about the first mate forgetting his glasses, before an alarm indicated the collision. The BEA accident report noted: 'There was an an atmosphere that was hardly compatible with the concentration needed to pilot a high-speed vessel in foggy conditions.' The pair had also not been paying enough attention to their radar in the fog, and had deactivated the ship's anti-collision system and had not turned on its fog horn, the court was told. Widow Delphine Lesaulnier, left, said after the trial she thought the sentences were 'unacceptable'. She comforted her daughter Elodie at the court . Mrs Lesaulnier's husband's death left her four children, including Elodie Lesaulnier, right, without a father . After the verdict, the victim's widow Delphine Lesaulnier said the court's decision was 'unacceptable'. She said outside court: 'This is ridiculous, it's nothing at all. It's like you can kill someone, destroy a family and nothing happens.' Le Romancer and Tournon were also ordered to jointly pay £6,800 in damages to the fishing boat captain's widow, £2,550 to each of his children and £1,700 to each of the other two surviving fishermen who had been on the boat at the time of the crash. Condor Ferries, based on the British island of Guernsey, was not prosecuted over the collision. Philippe Lesaulnier's widow reacted with fury to their lenient sentences. ‘It’s nothing at all,’ said Delphine Lesaulnier, the mother of Mr Lesaulnier’s four children. ‘It’s like you can kill someone, destroy a family and nothing happens.’ Condor Ferries, based on the British island of Guernsey, did not face prosecution.","A court heard a recording of Captain Paul Le Romancer and first mate Yves Tournon discussing 'sexy' Hally Berry and drug tests before the crash .

"The mother of French president Francois Hollande's four children has reacted angrily after her face was used to advertise an adultery website. Segolene Royal is pictured on billboards for the Victoria Milan infidelity website alongside the slogan: 'Give your passion free rein - have an affair'. The 60-year-old former 2007 presidential candidate is shown smiling with her skirt blowing in the wind beside a French flag to promote the site for cheating couples. 'It's a violation of the law': Segolene Royal, the ex-partner of French President Francois Hollande, has reacted furiously to this advert which uses her face to promote a pro-adultery website . Ms Royal - the president's partner for 28 years - has demanded that the company withdraw the adverts which have appeared across Paris. She told French daily Le Figaro: 'I find the use of my likeness or my name for financial ends unacceptable. 'It's a violation of the law, and I've taken steps to demand that they withdraw the campaign.' But Victoria Milan has refused to remove her from the controversial ad campaign - instead praising her for her 'courage'. Demanding site withdraws campaign: Ms Royal was Mr Hollande's partner for 28 years until he left her for the current first lady Valerie Trierweiler and is also the mother of his four children . Claims: Several biographies suggested Mr Hollande and his current partner Ms Trierweiler (right) had been having an affair for years while he was with Ms Royal . Spokeswoman Aishah Vassallo, of parent company Digisecmedia, told Le Figaro: 'Segolene Royal is a modern and avant-garde person who encourages others people and public personas to be courageous. 'We think the same way as her - that is, we want to liberate people, encourage them to realise their passions, and make their lives vibrant again. 'The free woman that Segolene Royal is, was the best person to embody our vision.' Mr Hollande and Ms Royal lived . together for 28 years before the president left her for Valérie . Trierweiler, his current partner and France's first lady. Several biographies suggested Mr Hollande and Ms Trierweiler had been having an affair for years. The . instense hatred between the two women boiled over yet again earlier . this year when Ms Royal called Ms Trierweiler 'nasty and aggressive'. Bitter rivalry: Ms Trierweiler (left) and Ms Royal (right) have been involved in a war of words in the media on several occasions over recent years . Ms . Trierweiler, a 48-year-old divorced glossy magazine journalist, caused . outrage last year when she tweeted support for a rival of Ms Royal in a . parliamentary election - one which Ms Royal went on to lose. When asked in a TV interview to plug a new book, Ms Royal was asked if she had forgiven Ms Trierweiler. Ms . Royal replied: 'In life, when you are betrayed, when someone hurts you - . what is more, gratuitously - when it's ferocious, when it's violent, if . you want to survive you have to forgive.'At the end of the day, they hurt themselves, you know, nasty and aggressive people.' A year ago, rival adultery website Ashley Madison used the faces of Francois Hollande and former presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy in a promotional campaign. Under an image of the men with fake lipstick superimposed on them, a tagline read: 'What do they all have in common? They should have thought of Ashley Madison.' The slogan was a clear reference to the three men's widely reported affairs and suggested they would have stayed secret with the use of the website.","Segolene Royal pictured by slogan: 'Give passion free rein - have an affair'

"Free man: Robert Lund in the dock in Albi, south west France. Lund, 55, originally from Darwen, Lancashire, was found guilty of killing his wife Evelyn and dumping her body in a lake . A British killer who beat his millionaire wife to death and dumped her body in a lake has been released after serving nine years in prison in France. Expat Robert Lund, 63, was jailed for 12 years for the manslaughter of wife Evelyn, who vanished from their French farmhouse on December 29, 1999. The 52-year-old’s decomposing body was only found two years later on the back seat of her car in a lake 15 miles from home, when a drought caused the water level to fall by 30ft. Lund, from Darwen, Lancashire, was not arrested until 2005, and was first convicted of killing her in 2007. He appealed the verdict but was jailed for a second time in 2009 by a higher court in Toulouse, south-west France. He failed in a last-ditch legal bid to clear his name in 2011, so he could claim hundreds of thousands of pounds of his ex-wife’s life insurance, which was transferred to him shortly before she died. During his final appeal hearing, the court was told how the couple moved from England to the remote village of Rayssac in 1997 after Evelyn’s first husband died of cancer. Lund insisted throughout the trial that she died in a tragic accident after suffering depression when her ‘idyllic new life’ in France turned sour. He told the court: 'England had bad memories for her, so we moved to France. The farmhouse we found was just right, and we thought it would be a nice place to live. 'I hoped it would make her happy. When my wife and I moved to France we thought everything would be ideal.' But he claimed his wife became depressed and began drinking heavily when she decided she no longer wanted to live in France. Robert Lund (pictured left) claimed his wife Evelyn (right)  became depressed and began drinking heavily when she decided she no longer wanted to live in France. But prosecutor Henri Renier branded Lund ‘a liar and a manipulator’ Once she hurled a carving knife at him, and on another occasion she tried to throw herself out of a speeding car, he claimed. He added: 'When she drank, she was extremely violent. I believe that my wife’s problem was depression and she drank because of the depression and it’s a spiral that’s very difficult to get out of.' Evelyn Lund, pictured with her  daughters Liz (left) and Trish (right) Daughter Elizabeth Camden, 42, said her mother had told her marrying Lund had been the 'worst mistake of her life' She died after driving home drunk from a friend’s house plunging her car into a lake, he said. But prosecutor Henri Renier branded Lund ‘a liar and a manipulator’. He said: 'She was a wealthy woman and he wanted her life insurance. 'When she came home on the night she died, they had an argument, he killed her and tried to cover it up by pretending she had disappeared.' Police had found traces of blood found on Mrs Lund’s clothing and the back seat of her Toyota car, proving she had died as a result of violence, he told the court. Mr Renier added: 'When her body entered the water she was breathing so little that she did not inhale any water, which indicates that she had already been knocked unconscious.' During his first two trials, Mrs Lund’s daughter Elizabeth Camden, 42, said her mother had told her marrying Lund had been the ‘worst mistake of her life’. Mrs Camden said: 'He was aggressive and violent towards her mother and had once left her covered in bruises and unable to get out of bed for a week. 'I warned her about marrying Lund. I told her she shouldn’t do that. Later she telephoned and said I had been right.' Lund has told a French newspaper that he was freed on 14 September. He continues to protest his innocence, and says he hopes for another retrial.","Expat Robert Lund was jailed for 12 years for wife Evelyn's manslaughter .

"Extreme abuse: The four children were beaten with iron bars and whips and locked in suitcases (file photo) A barbaric couple who ‘waterboarded’ their four children during ten years of captivity and abuse have gone on trial in Belgium. Parents Sebastien Hardenne and Isabelle Simon also kept their three girls and a boy in a locked room at night and ‘fed’ them through a small hole in the wall, it was heard. They beat them with sticks, an iron bar and whips and tortured them with an electric fly swatter, police have revealed. The father urinated in the children’s mouths and even practised ‘water-boarding’ torture similar to that allegedly used at America’s Guantanamo Bay prison, the court was told. Two girls were also locked in a suitcase smeared with dog excrement and swung around a room, it was heard. Social services in the town of Biron were alerted by the children’s school in 2003 that they were dirty and undernourished, but the warning went unheeded. The youngsters - now aged 11 to around 16 - are being cared for permanently by social services in the town of Namur. Neighbour Anne-Marie Durieux told Belgian media the saw the couple as worse than notorious Belgian child killer Marc Dutroux. She added: 'They are worse than him because they did it to their own children. 'It makes me feel physically ill to realise now the extent of what the children were suffering and that I didn’t spot it.' In care: The children are now being looked after in Namur, South Belgium .

"Tests on fluids from Yasser Arafat's body revealed 'unexplained' higher levels of polonium 210 . Former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may have been poisoned to death with radioactive polonium, scientists in Switzerland have revealed. Arafat died in France on November 11, 2004, at the age of 75, but at the time doctors were unable to specify the cause of death. Experts revealed that several belongings and items of clothing belonging to Arafat, including his toothbrush, hat and underwear, contained high 'unexplained levels' of the radioactive material. The material is the same as that used to murder former Russian spy Alexander Litvenenko in London in 2006. Arafat, who died after falling ill at his headquarters in the West Bank, showed symptoms of nausea, stomach pain and kidney and liver failure - signs consistent with radiation poisoning. But the lack of hair loss or a shortage of bone marrow casts doubt on that theory, the scientists admit. Much rumour had surrounded Arafat's death after doctors couldn't identify how he died. Suggestions ranged from the aspersion that he had died from HIV to claims that rivals had poisoned him. Speculation continued unabated when his widow Suha initially refused a post-mortem examination on her husband's body. But she changed her mind and asked judges in France last year to launch a murder probe into her husband's death, claiming he was poisoned because he was an 'obstacle to peace'. Experts at Lausanne's Radiation Physics Institute have now released details of the tests which 'support the possibility' he did not die of natural causes. The tests were ordered by Arafat's widow Suha (pictured together), who believes her husband was killed because he was 'an obstacle to peace' A statement said: 'Several tests on . samples of bodily fluids contained an unexplained higher level of . polonium 210, compared to control samples. 'These findings support the possibility of Arafat's poisoning with polonium 210.' They examined 37 items of Arafat's clothing and compared levels of polonium with a similar number of uncontaminated items. Computer projections, which estimate the speed at which the radioactive material breaks down, suggested that the levels of polonium 210 would have been consistent with a 'lethal ingestion' in 2004. The . team, whose findings are published in British medical journal The . Lancet this week, said they regretted that no post-mortem investigation . was carried out after Arafat's death. Polonium breaks down quickly in the human body and is difficult to trace if there is a delay. Remembered: Arafat remains a Palestinian national hero and his tomb is still a site of political pilgrimage . The researchers . added: 'An autopsy would have been useful in this case because although . potential polonium poisoning might not have been identified during that . procedure, body samples could have been kept and tested afterwards.' Mrs . Arafat's lawyer Pierre-Olivier Sud told the French media last year: . 'Suha Arafat hopes that the authorities will be able to establish the . exact circumstances of her husband's death and uncover the truth, so . that justice can be done. 'She and her family want the truth and . nothing but the truth. There is no question of any ideological or . political exploitation.' Mrs Arafat also told Arabic TV channel Al Jazeera in July 2012 that both the US and Israel had regarded her husband as 'an obstacle to peace'. She added: 'I want the world to know the truth about the assassination of Yasser Arafat.' Arafat had been confined by Israel to his headquarters in Ramallah when he fell ill in October 2004. He was then given permission to be taken to the Percy military hospital near Paris, telling aides before he left: 'God willing, I will be back.' But less than a month after arriving, he slipped into a coma and died on November 11, 2004. Doctors who treated him said at the time he may have died of a blood clotting disorder and ruled out poisoning. French daily Le Monde reported at the time that it had 'very good sources' who had revealed he died of a condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). It described the condition as 'the complete disruption of the mechanisms which normally assure proper blood clotting and can lead to major internal bleeding and possible death'. The paper quoted one doctor as saying: 'We also worked on the question of poisoning, using sophisticated techniques, before concluding with a negative.' While Palestinians say that any evidence that Arafat was poisoned would suggest that Israel was somehow involved, an Israeli Government spokesman has rubbished those suggestions. Polonium-210 was used to kill former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 . Alexander Litvinenko, a 44-year-old ex-KGB officer who had defected from Russia to the United Kingdom in 2000, was killed by polonium 210 in 2006 in London. He had been admitted to hospital with severe abdominal pains a month before his death, which were initially diagnosed as caused by thallium, a toxin used in Russian rat poison. Since thallium was supposedly a favourite poison of the KGB in the Cold War era and Litvinenko was an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, it was initially believed Litvinenko might have been the victim of the FSB, the Russian security service that took over from the KGB. He died in November 2006, leaving behind a deathbed statement accusing Putin of orchestrating his murder. But hours before his death medical tests revealed that the fatal poison was not thallium but polonium-210, a critical component in the making of early-stage nuclear bombs. A russian secret service agent was blamed in Press reports for the poisoning as he had met with Litvinenko at a London hotel just before he fell ill. It was alleged that the agent had slipped the polonium into Litvinenko’s tea. But it later emerged that traces of the isotope were found at a sushi bar that Litvinenko had visited before meeting the agent. The mystery surrounding his death remains and his murder has never been solved.","The tests on Arafat's bodily fluids were ordered by his widow Suha .

"It has long been a national stereotype, that the French just can't help cheating on their partners. But now a survey has backed that up. According to research, more than half of French men and a third of women have cheated on their partners. And more than a third of all French people would be prepared to cheat if they were sure they wouldn't get caught, according to the study by pollsters Ifop this week. It also found that the amount of unfaithful French partners had more than doubled from 19 per cent in the 1970s to 40 per cent today. A survey has revealed more than a third of all French people would be prepared to cheat if they were sure they wouldn't get caught like President Hollande, pictured here with his partner Valerie Trierweiler . Those most likely to cheat, at 66 per cent, were professional men over 50, and men with left-wing political views at 45 per cent. And 63 per cent of all French people believe it is possible to remain in love with their partner even if he or she has played away, the survey found. It also comes as it is revealed cheating President . Francois Hollande's popularity has soared in France since his affair . with a glamorous actress was made public, a new survey has found. The . philandering French leader's approval rating has leapt to 31 per cent, . up from 26 per cent in October - the lowest level for a French president . in modern times. The BVA . poll was carried out a week after details of 59-year-old Hollande's . secret trysts with Julie Gayet, 41, emerged on January 10. Valerie Trierweiler, 49, has told friends she is prepared to forgive Mr Hollande if he states both publicly and privately that his affair with Ms Gayet is over. The other woman: President Hollande has been accused of having an affair with the actress Julie Gayet, 41 . But Hollande and Gayet are said to be 'deeply in love' and determined to remain together, according to reports in France's Journal du Dimanche newspaper. Ifop researcher Francois Kraus said of their latest survey, commissioned by extramarital dating website Gleeden: 'There's basically much more temptation around now, so people have more partners. 'Women are more present in the working environment so they come into contact with other men, there's technology and social media, meaning people can communicate in private. 'The most interesting statistic is that more than one in three French people say they are prepared to cheat on their partners as long as they were sure they won't be found out. 'We also found that women are much less accepting of 'mistakes' than men.' The Ifop poll is backed by a similar 2013 study by the Pew Research Center which found that the French were among the world's least offended by infidelity. Around 47 per cent of French people reported that infidelity was morally unacceptable, compared to 55 of the British, 60 per cent of Germans, 64 per cent of Spanish, 65 per cent of Italians and 84 per cent of Americans.","Researchers found number of unfaithful French partners is now 40% .

"Two bosses of furniture giant Ikea have been quizzed by police over claims that managers spied on 'awkward customers' and 'suspicious staff' at its stores in France. Ikea France's chief executive Stefan Vanoverbeke and chief financial officer Dariusz Rychert were formally detained by police in Versailles on Monday morning. The questioning was expected to last until late Monday, a police source told French news agency AFP. Ikea France's chief executive Stefan Vanoverbeke (pictured) and chief financial officer Dariusz Rychert were formally detained by police over claims managers spied on 'awkward customers' and 'suspicious staff' The probe is linked to claims last year that the Swedish company carried out criminal records checks and links to political groups on more than 200 people. The scandal erupted after an Ikea insider leaked emails to a newspaper in March 2012 showing the firm had paid private detectives to pilfer reports from the national French police database. Police then swooped on the firm's French HQ in Versailles last month and seized computers and documents. France's Canard Enchaine newspaper said at the time: 'Questions were asked about more than 200 people, including requests for criminal records, vehicle registration checks and affiliations with political organisations. 'Ikea's head of security authorised payments of 80 euros for each check carried out. 'The information was then used in deciding whether to fire certain staff members or provide intellgence on awkward customers involved in legal disputes with them.' The probe is linked to claims last year that Ikea carried out criminal records checks and links to political groups on more than 200 people . Ikea began its own internal inquiry and fired four executives earlier this year following the allegations. A company spokesman said in a statement when the claims first emerged: 'There have unfortunately within the IKEA group existed work practices that are contrary to the company's values and ethical standards. 'As a result of this, a former national manager, a former human resources manager, a former chief financial officer and the current head of security will leave their positions and the IKEA group.' It is not the first time the company has been criticised over its security methods. A 2010 book called The Truth About IKEA claimed the company was 'racism and nepotistic' and said its surveillance methods on staff were 'worthy of the Stasi'.","Ikea France's chief executive Stefan Vanoverbeke and chief financial officer Dariusz Rychert were formally detained .

"France is moving ahead with plans to 'desecrate' the World War Two D-Day beaches with a vast offshore wind farm. The proposed 75 turbines each 100 metres high have been branded by campaigners as 'an insult to the memory of the thousands who died there'.

It is is part of a strategy to make renewable energy account for almost a quarter of France's needs by around 2030. Opponent Claude Brevan, who is heading a campaign to axe the project, said Juno beach where Canadian soldiers landed would suffer the worst blight. Sword, Gold, Omaha and Utah beaches where British and American troops landed would be less affected, she said. But Jean-Louis Butre, president of the European Platform Against Wind Farms, said: 'We consider this project to be a sacrilege on the families of the 10,000 soldiers who sacrificed their lives to save France from tyranny.' World War Two widow Gisele Forknall told a campaign meeting this week: 'We owe it to these soldiers, to these veterans who were dog-tired but had the courage to land, to respect the freedom that they gave us. 'Desecration'? Colleville Sur Mere Cemetry, where thousands of heroes are buried, is visible from Omaha beach, in the distance . 'Windmills are OK, but just not here. There has been too much blood spilt.' Briton William Jordan, who offers guided tours of the area, said: 'To imagine the events of June 6, 1944 when thousands of Allied vessels arrived one needs an empty horizon like a painter needs an empty canvas.' Opponent Karel Scheerlinck, who lives near Juno Beach, added: 'These beaches belong to history. It's from here that the liberation of the world began. 'It is an insult to the dead and don't think the Germans would permit the construction of a wind park next to the ruins of a concentration camp. These are sacred areas.' But former local councillor Anne d'Ornano said she had met with Canadian veterans who were not opposed to the project. Normandy remembered: The turbines will be divided among five separate offshore wind farms along the coast where thousands of allied soldiers perished in June 1944, covering a total of 330 square miles and costing around ten million pounds . She said: 'They believe in the future. They have offshore wind farms in their countries. They are thinking about future generations. They just want their regiment's insignia to be there somewhere as a sign of homage.' And Adrian Cox, a British councillor in Arromanches-les-Bains, said: 'I have received outraged emails asking, 'How can they have windmills on the beaches?' 'But two years ago I met a veteran who looked around and then he said 'This is not my beach anyway. When I landed these buildings were not there'. Now my friends are buried underneath them'.' Jacky Bonnemains, president of French ecological group Robin des Bois, said the project was launched two years ago: 'I find it extraordinary no one in government grasps that this will change forever the character of a place of sacred memory. They just don't seem to care.' But EDF Energy insists the impact on the view from the Normandy beaches will be 'limited'. It claims that a 525ft-high tower seen from almost ten miles away is equivalent to seeing a matchstick from a metre away. A French government spokesman added: 'The whole project is being handled with the greatest sensitivity.'","EDF wants to build 75 100m-tall turbines along Normandy coast .

"France is set to ban electronic cigarettes from public places and subject them to he same tight controls as tobacco, the government has announced. The move has sparked outrage among sellers and users of the battery-powered devices which contain liquid nicotine that is turned into a vapor when inhaled. Health Minister Marisol Touraine confirmed reports that a ban would go ahead on France's Europe 1 radio today. The electronic cigarettes are currently legal to use, while 'normal' cigarettes have been banned for five years in France . She said: 'The e-cigarette is not an ordinary product. We need to apply the same measures as there are for tobacco. 'That means making sure it cannot be smoked in public places, that its sale is restricted to over 18s and that firms are not allowed to advertise the products.' The plans come after recommendations to outlaw the devices were made in a specialist French report published earlier this week. E-cigarettes are currently legal to use in bars and restaurants and all other public places, where traditional smoking has been banned for five years. A ban would harm the booming e-cigarette industry in France, where around 500,000 people use the gadgets, vendors insist. Darren Moon, the English owner of online store Vapshop.fr, said: 'If they ban it in public or in the workplace, I'll be closing my store, or moving it somewhere where there aren't restrictions like that. 'Twenty percent of our business is selling disposable e-cigarettes to restaurants, clubs, bars and hotels. So if there's a workplace ban, I'd have to start firing people.' A spokesman from the London-based market intelligence firm Euromonitor International said today: 'The e-cigarette market is developing very rapidly in France. 'The two main advantages of e-cigarettes is that they're seen as healthier than traditional cigarettes, and you can use them in settings like bars and restaurants, where traditional cigarettes aren't allowed. 'A measure like a public ban would reduce the public perception of harmlessness and remove the practical benefit of smoking an e-cigarette in the first place. So it would be highly damaging to the industry.' E-cigarettes were first invented in China in 2003, as many nations began imposing bans on smoking, and are aimed at giving the user a similar sensation to smoking a cigarette. They were thought to be much healthier than normal smoking is because they do not contain the tobacco and other carcinogens found in cigarettes. But many experts have since expressed concerns about certain chemicals contained in the liquid, notably the compound propylene glycol. In May 2011, the French health agency AFSSAPS advised against using the devices, saying they still contained nicotine, which even at a low concentration could lead to 'damaging side effects'. In March this year, health expert Professor Bertrand Dauzenberg told Europe 1 radio tha e-cigarettes could have the opposite effect that is designed for. He added: 'These electronic cigarettes could also lead children to start smoking and sale should be banned to minors. 'However for heavy smokers, I believe these will reduce the health risks, but the best way to quit smoking is the patch or chewing gum.'","Follows five-year ban on regular tobacco cigarettes across France .

"French extreme right-wing leader Marine Le Pen faces potential prosecution for branding Muslims in France as 'like a Nazi occupation'. The National Front chief risks being put on trial after members of the European Parliament's judicial committee in Brussels voted to lift her legal immunity as an MEP. Ms Le Pen sparked uproar among in France after a speech at a party rally in December 2012 when she denounced Muslims praying in the street in areas where there are no mosques. Stripped of legal immunity: French National Front leader Marine Le Pen could now face trial for inciting racial hatred after comparing the country's Muslim community to the Nazi occupation . France has a population of around five million Muslims, the highest of any European country. Le Pen told supporters: 'For those who like to talk about World War II, to talk about occupation, we could talk about, for once, the occupation of our territory. 'There are no armoured vehicles, no soldiers, but it is an occupation all the same and it weighs on people.' French prosecutors asked the EU last November to lift the her immunity as a lawmaker so she could be prosecuted for inciting racial hatred. The European Parliament's legal committee voted overwhelmingly yesterday that Le Pen could be charged and the full parliament is now expected to formally lift her protection in the coming weeks. British Tory MEP and legal affairs committee member Sajjad Karim said: 'There is a red line between freedom of speech and inciting racial hatred. 'I, along with many other MEPs, today voted to drop Ms Le Pen's immunity and I am confident that the majority of the European Parliament will follow our lead in July.' A woman wears a burqa as she walks on a street in Saint-Denis, near Paris in 2010: France has a population of around five million Muslims, the highest of any European country . Le Pen, 47, is renowned for her outspoken views on immigration - but is also riding on a wave of popular support and would come second in another presidential election. Last year she tried to prosecute pop star Madonna for screening an image of her with a Swastika on her head at a Paris concert. She also recently had a news photographer banned from taking any more pictures of her - because he makes her look 'ugly'. Her father and former National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen was stripped of his legal protection as an MEP to face charges of holocaust denial in 1998.","MEPs have begun process of stripping the far-right leader of legal immunity .

"A barbaric couple who 'water-boarded' their four children during a decade of captivity and extreme abuse have been jailed for ten years in Belgium. Parents Sebastien Hardenne and Isabelle Simon kept their three girls and a boy in a locked room at night and 'fed' them excrement-smeared food through a hole in the wall. The father urinated in the children's mouths, beat them with an iron bar and whips and tortured them with an electric fly swatter. Barbaric:  A couple who 'water-boarded' their four children during ten years of captivity and extreme abuse have been jailed for ten years in Belgium. The children are now being looked after in Namur, pictured . Two girls were also locked in a suitcase smeared with dog excrement and swung around a room. Sadistic Hardenne also performed 'water-boarding' torture similar to that allegedly used at America's Guantanamo Bay prison, the court in Marche-en-Famenne was told. Social services in the town of Biron were alerted by the children's school in 2003 that they were dirty and undernourished, but they were only taken into care once in a decade for two months before being returned to their parents. The parents were finally arrested earlier this year after an anonymous tip-off to the authorities. Hardenne and Simon, in their 40s, were both jailed for ten years yesterday for 'inflicting inhuman treatment'. The couple's lawyer Jacqueline Petit . told the court they 'felt sorry' for what they had done and handed the . court a letter of apology from the parents to their children. Torture: The couple are said to have practiced 'water-boarding' torture similar to that allegedly used at Guantanamo Bay prison, the court was told . The youngsters - now aged 11 to around 16 - are being cared for permanently by social services in the town of Namur. Neighbour Anne-Marie Durieux told Belgian media she saw the couple as worse than notorious Belgian child killer Marc Dutroux. She added: 'They are worse than him because they did it to their own children. 'Hardenne once told me he had spoiled his children by giving them chips to eat. I later learnt he had made them throw them up. 'They had two terrace houses side-by-side and had a hole cut in the wall to pass through food to the children in a locked room. Now I know the food was soiled with urine and excrement. 'It makes me feel physically ill to realise now the extent of what the children were suffering and that I didn't spot it.' An uncle of the children who is their mother's brother-in-law was also jailed for six years for his role in the abuse.","Sebastien Hardenne and Isabelle .

"A 52-year-old mother who 'dressed like a teenager' to sit her daughter's end of term English exam has been arrested in France. The middle-aged woman wore low-waisted skinny jeans and Converse shoes to sit the English language baccalaureate in Paris. But a sharp-eyed invigilator who had seen the 19-year-old daughter taking her philosophy paper a week earlier realised the woman was an imposter and called police. Dressed in casual clothes: A 52-year-old mother who 'dressed like a teenager' to sit her daughter's end of term English exam has been arrested in France. (Stock image, posed by model) She was arrested when the exam ended so as not to disturb other students taking the paper this week, a Paris police spokesman said. He added: 'The mother was dressed in the casual clothes a typical teenager would wear. 'She was held briefly in custody and freely admitted what she had done. She said she was better at English than her daughter.' Get the look: The middle-aged woman wore low-waisted skinny jeans and Converse shoes like these to blend in with her daughters fellow students as she sat the English language baccalaureate in Paris . The mother now faced fraud charges and a fine of up to £7,000. The daughter faced being banned from taking all public exams for five years, police said. The baccalaureate was introduced by Napoleon in 1808 and is France's main school-leaving exam. Students usually take five subjects which they must pass if they wish to go to university.","Sharp-eyed invigilator noticed it wasn't the same person who had sat the student's philosophy paper a week earlier .

"French cycle race convicts have been told 'no breakaway sprints' when they are let out to complete a stage of the Tour de France race next month. The prisoners will cycle a gruelling mountain course from Bastia to Ajjacio on the island of Corsica - flanked by the fittest prison guards as outriders. But the inmates have been instructed not to break away from the main peleton, or pack of riders, in a bid to reach the finish line first. Captivating course: A selected group of prisoners will be allowed take part in one of the stages of the 100th Tour de France - albeit under the watch of guards . Many of the 40 men taking part are . serving sentences for crimes linked to the Mediterranean island's . ongoing nationalist stuggle for independence.

"Per Sandberg has caused outrage in the French media with his comments . A leading Norwegian MP has called for French people to be banned from visiting his country because they are 'notorious criminals'. Per Sandberg - who is head of parliament's judicial affairs committee - said large groups of tourists from France, Romania and Bulgaria should be stopped at the border. The deputy leader of the main opposition Progress Party said: 'We need immediate measures to stop the influx of begging and crime. 'At the borders, police can under existing laws stop organised groups of Romanians, Bulgarians or French because we know from experience that these people disrupt the peace.' And he added in the statement posted online: 'It has also been proven that they are notorious for engaging in criminal activities.' The remarks have caused outrage in the French media, where France Info news said: 'We French are certainly not more criminally inclined than anyone else. 'This man is an idiot in ski boots. Why pick on us?' It is not the first time Mr Sandberg has stirred up controversy with his extreme views. Sandberg is the deputy leader of the opposition Progress Party in the Norwegian parliament, which sits in the Storting , pictured . In 1999, he proposed that the Norwegian government should be able to deport foreigners if their children committed crimes. In 2006, he said large areas of Norway could be under the jurisdiction of Islamic Sharia Law. Norway is not a member of the European Union, but has signed up to the Schengen Agreement which allows the free movement of most Europeans - including the French - across its borders.","Per Sandberg said tourists groups should be stopped at Norwegian border .

"French first lady Valerie Trierweiler costs the taxpayer three times less than former president Nicolas Sarkozy’s wife Carla Bruni. Socialist president Francois Hollande’s girlfriend has monthly ‘running costs’ of £16,730 for her office and five staff at the Elysee Palace. But supermodel Miss Bruni ran up a £52,858 bill, with eight staff, and another team running her official website. Valerie Trierweiler (right) costs French taxpayers a third less a month than former first lady Carla Bruni (left) The figures emerged after right-wing MP Guillaume Larrive tabled a parliamentary question demanding to know how much France was spending on Miss Trierweiler. The answer was published on Prime . Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault’s website, but it added that ‘as a . comparison’, Carla Bruni cost three times more. Both Miss Trierweiler and Miss Bruni have been accused of excessive spending, with the present first lady even the target of an ongoing legal action for abusing public money. Supermarket chain heir Xavier Kemlin launched the highly unusual complaint, claiming the taxpayer should not be supporting her lifestyle as the ‘president’s mistress’. President Francois Hollande's girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler is currently the target of a bizarre legal action claiming she is abusing public money . Former president Nicolas Sarkozy's wife Carla Bruni has been accused of being a 'fashion victim' like Marie Antoinette . The court in Saint-Etienne is obliged to study Mr Kemlin’s case before ruling on whether Miss Trierweiler should face prosecution, but experts say it has no chance of success. Three years ago, prominent Belgian historian Patrick Weber branded former catwalk model Bruni a ‘frivolous fashion victim who is isolated from reality’. In his book called Queen Carla he said her love of high fashion and obsession with psychotherapy left her cut off from the French people. He wrote: 'She behaves like the former queens of France, who is consorting with her king after an arranged marriage. 'She is rich and Italian like Catherine de Medici, a follower of the arts like Anne of Brittany and a frivolous fashion victim like Marie-Antoinette’.'","President's girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler's office costs £16,730 a month .

"Protestors clashed with riot police in France last night after gay marriage was legalised following months of fierce debate. Within hours of the decision to allow gay couples to wed, a protest near Paris's Invalides complex of museums and monuments turned violent with officers working late into the night to restore calm. Protestors pelted police with glass bottles, cans and metal bars, and officers responded by firing tear gas into the crowds. Trouble: Security guards scuffle with anti gay marriage protestors as the practice was legalised by politicians in France yesterday . Violent protests: Demonstrators light flares and square up to riot police with the Eiffel Tower in the background following the decision yesterday . Prepared: Riot police guard the National Assembly yesterday as lawmakers decided to legalise gay marriage in France . Opposition: Those opposed to gay marriage converged on Concorde Square in Paris, but protests soon turned ugly . The issue appears to have galvanized the country's faltering right, which had been ripped apart recently by infighting and their election loss to President Francois Hollande. France is the 14th country - and the largest - to legalise gay marriage. Justice minister Christiane Taubira said the first weddings could be as soon as June following the 331-225 vote in the Socialist majority National Assembly. Opponents of the law say France is not ready to legalise adoption for same-sex couples, and polls show a country sharply divided on the issue. Victory: Pro gay marriage protestors wave rainbow flags as the news breaks that politicians had voted in favour of gay marriage . Celebrations: Those in favour of gay marriage celebrate the decision in Paris yesterday . Victory: French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault congratulates family minister Dominique Bertinotti, right, as justice minister Christiane Taubira, left, looks on, after lawmakers approved a bill legalising same-sex marriage . Mr Ayrault celebrates with Mrs Taubira: She said the the first weddings could be as soon as June after the 331-225 vote in the Socialist majority National Assembly which passed the new law yesterday afternoon . Thousands of police mobilised ahead of the vote, taking up positions with water cannon outside the French parliament, preparing for duelling protests around the National Assembly building and along the Seine River. Earlier in the day, there appeared to be more police than protesters outside the Parliament building on Paris' Left Bank, but that calculation soon shifted as night fell and thousands gathered to protest the bill. The protest dwindled to a few stalwarts shortly before midnight, when the violence began among a few hundred demonstrators including some who carried signs saying 'Socialist dictatorship' Claire Baron, 41, a mother of two, said that she 'will oppose the bill until the end.' She said: 'I'll keep going to the protests, I don't give in. The bill is not effective yet, the president of the Republic must listen to our voices. 'We are here to defend family values. Children need a mum and a dad.' France is the 14th country to legalise gay marriage, and today's vote comes a week after New Zealand - with very little controversy - allowed same-sex couples to wed. The extraordinary security was put in place to protect the National Assembly in Paris following large and at times violent protests in the months leading up to this afternoon's vote. Mrs Taubira and interior minister Manuel Valls address members of parliament: Opponentssay France is not ready to legalise adoption for same-sex couples, and polls show a country sharply divided on the issue . In recent weeks, violent attacks against gay couples have spiked and some legislators have received threats - including one sent a gunpowder-filled envelope. One protest against gay marriage ended in clouds of tear gas earlier this month with some demonstrators fighting police and damaging cars along the Champs-Elysees avenue. But while some were outraged at the passing of the new law, others took to the streets to celebrate. 'I feel immense joy, gigantic joy,' said 39-year old Sylvain Rouzel. 'At last, everyone has the same rights. This is huge. France was lagging behind. We had to wait 14 years after the civil union to finally obtain the right to get married, with equal rights for everyone. I feel great.' Paris' openly gay mayor, Bertrand Delanoe, was among the crowd of hundreds gathered for the street celebration in the Marais, the city's historic gay neighborhood. The highly controversial new law also makes it legal for gays and lesbians to adopt children, and ban the words 'mother' and 'father' from all official documents. The new law had been expected pass comfortably in the Socialist-controlled legislature. Demonstrators against gay marriage face riot . police in Paris on Sunday: Riot police were deployed outside the French . parliament today as lawmakers prepared to vote to make it the 14th . country to legalise gay marriage . Anger: The extraordinary security was put in . place to protect the National Assembly following large and at times . violent protests by those who oppose legalisation in the months leading . up to this afternoon's vote . When President Francois Hollande initially promised to legalise gay marriage, it was seen as relatively uncontroversial. But . the issue rejuvenated the country's conservative movement and brought . together the far right, the Catholic Church and many French families . from the countryside. It had even sparked physical scuffles between right and left wing MPs during debates in the National Assembly. Unpopular: The change in law promised . by Francois Hollande (pictured) has  brought together the far right, the Catholic . Church and many rural French . The new law states that 'marriage is a union of two people, of different or the same gender', and it swaps all references in the civil code to 'mothers and fathers' to simply 'parents'. Now it has passed, opposition parties have pledged to challenge the law in France's highest court, the Constitutional Council. And if that fails, they hope public hostility will pressurise Mr Hollande into not signing it into law, just as former president Jacques Chirac backed down from signing an employment law that was voted by parliament in 2006. Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, head of the French Catholic Church, was also leading his own campaign to stop the law, warning followers that gay marriage could lead to legalised incest and polygamy in society. He told the Christian's RFC radio station: 'Gay marriage would herald a complete breakdown in society. 'This could have innumerable consequences. Afterward they will want to create couples with three or four members. And after that, perhaps one day the taboo of incest will fall.' Legalising gay marriage was one of Mr . Hollande's key manifesto pledges, but less than a year later, observers . say he has been surprised by the scale of public opposition to the . measure. There has also a . been a sharp rise in the number of homophobic attacks in recent weeks, . and several initially peaceful protests have degenerated into violence. The . law also comes amid a poll showing Mr Hollande has become the most . unpopular president in five decades - with a personal approval rating of . just 25 per cent. No to homophobia: Pro-gay marriage protesters at . a counter demonstration also held on Sunday. The new law will also allow gays and lesbians to adopt and ban the words 'mother' and . 'father' from official documents . Divisive issue: Although President Hollande's . Socialist party is expected to carry this afternoon's vote by a . two-thirds majority, polls show half of the French population are . opposed to gay marriage . His first 11 months in office have been blighted by a catalogue of political, economic and personal crises as he finds himself unable to control either the public finances or the wayward antics of First Lady Valerie Trierweiler. Millionaires have been fleeing France in fear of a proposed 75 per cent tax on all earnings over one million euros. The French equivalent of the UK's Confederation of British Industry, called MEDEF, has warned the president that France risked becoming 'the poor man of Europe' over his 'disastrous' economic policies. And his problems then culminated this month with revelations his own budget minister Jerome Cahuzac had been hiding up to €20million in a secret bank account to dodge taxes. Political observer Thierry Kutlay said: 'I don't think he ever thought running France would be so hard. In the face of such fierce opposition to so many of his other policies, he will be a brave man to sign gay marriage into law.'","Half of French voters are against allowing gays to marry, polls show .

"Tycoon blast: The new online game sets out to kill billionaire steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal . A video game in which players try to 'kill' British-based steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal has been released in France. In the online game, players hurl barrels and rocks at police outside the loss-making steel blast furnaces in Florange, eastern France, which the Indian tycoon closed down. The Indian billionaire himself appears in the futuristic game as a robot who must be bludgeoned to death. A text on the screen reads: ‘The year is 2030. Mittal has closed the majority of steel factories worldwide, tossing out thousands of steelworkers. ‘For these men tired of unfulfilled promises and repeated closures, when all mediation has failed, there is just one solution: Kill Mittal.’ Once the Mittal robot is defeated, however, the game finally reminds the player that although Mittal has been killed, he will quickly be replaced by someone similar. The game's creator Alexandre Grilletta has insisted it is simply a 'bit of fun' and not meant to incite violence, adding: ‘The Florange protests just had the right ingredients of heroes and baddies to make a good game.’ The Mittal row began in December when the boss of the Arcelor Mittal steel conglomerate announced he was axing 630 jobs at the Florange plant, blaming lack of demand from the vehicle industry. When President Hollande threatened to nationalise the factory, Mr Mittal called his bluff by threatening to close down all his operations in France, where his company employs 20,000 people. A deal was finally struck where Mr Mittal could close down two blast furnaces in Florange as long as he promised to find new jobs for the redundant workers. But it ended with France's industry minister Arnaud Montebourg annoucing on live TV: ‘I have to tell you that Lakshmi Mittal is using blackmail and lies. Quite simply, we don't want him in France anymore.’ Critics have condemned the new video . game , which can be found at www.killmittal.com, as glorifying the . militancy of French unions - which many blame for the decline of the . country's once mighty industrial sector. French . daily Le Figaro said: ‘It is hardly in the spirit of flexible unions . that work with management to keep their factories open.’ Retaliation: The game, which sees players attack police at the recently closed steel blast furnaces in Florange, eastern France, has been viewed as a result of Mr Mittall's decision to close the plant . Socialist President Francois Hollande pledged when he took office a year ago to revive France's ailing industrial base - but the latest figures show the country's economy had no growth in 2012 and shrank by 0.8 per cent in the first three months of 2013. Unemployment is already at a 30-year high of 10.5 per cent and forecast to rise to 11.6 per cent next year. And with Mr Hollande's popularity now at 25 per cent - the lowest of any Gallic leader in 50 years - the chief economist at France's AXA insurance group Eric Chaney has compared his predicament to that of Alice in Wonderland when she meets the Queen of Hearts down a rabbit hole. In the book, the Queen tells Alice: ‘My dear, here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place. And if you wish to go anywhere, you must run twice as fast as that.’ Mr Chaney added: ‘The situation is much worse in France in the past year. Italy and Spain are implementing reforms. France is doing nothing. ‘So it is getting closer to the periphery of weaker European nations. What the queen said to Alice applies to France.’","Video game called 'Kill Mittal' released on website in France .

"French president Francois Hollande has been accused by one of his most senior political allies of running a 'paparazzi democracy' for ordering all ministers to publicly declare their wealth. Claude Bartolone - the socialist leader of France's parliament - told the president: 'The French don't want everything we have put on display.' While urban . affairs minister Francois Lamy told France's Canal Plus television: . 'It's an outrage. Do you think the public would also like to see a . picture of my wife in the nude?' Outrage: The French president, left, has ordered all ministers to publicly declare their wealth. Urban affairs minister Francois Lamy, right, said: 'It's an outrage. Do you think the public would also like to see a picture of my wife in the nude?' Mr Bartolone's defiant outburst on live radio after Mr Hollande told his entire cabinet to publish full details of their assets. The sudden drive for complete financial transparency came after it emerged that an ex-cabinet member had hidden up to 12 million pounds from the tax-man in a Swiss bank. The publication of wealth then sparked charges of hypocrisy when it was revealed there were six millionaires in the president's left-wing government. Now Mr Bartolone has told RTL radio: 'The majority of French people don't want to live in a paparazzi democracy where everything is on show. Claude Bartolone - the socialist leader of France's parliament - told the president: 'The French don't want everything we have put on display' 'There should be a way of protecting the private life of elected politicians while still maintaining controls. 'The Transparency Commission simply needs to have the power to investigate when there is doubt. 'The French people only need to be reassured that their MPs are honest and not using their positions to line their pockets.' Other ministers also reacted with fury at being ordered to lay bare their personal finances to the public. Following . the 'voluntary' declarations earlier this month, a new law on financial . transparency among ministers and other top officials is now set to be . adopted by the summer. The . Cahuzac tax scandal came as a massive blow to the credibility of Mr . Hollande, who made a key manifesto pledge to crack down on tax dodging. The president hopes the declarations . will restore faith in his flagging administration, but critics have . accused him of knowing about and covering up Cahuzac's tax dodging and . of mismanagement for having believed his denials. Mr Bartolone's attack on his leader . also comes as a new poll this week revealed Mr Hollande has become the . most unpopular president in five decades. His . historically low approval rating of just 25 per cent of the population . makes him even more unpopular than President Charles de Gaulle was in . 1968 - when millions of French rioted to demand a complete overhaul of . French society. Mr . Hollande came to power in May 2012 amid a fanfare of promises to . redistribute wealth and rebuild France's ailing public services. Anger: Claude Bartolone made the defiant outburst on live radio after Mr Hollande told his entire cabinet to publish full details of their assets . But after eight months in the job, he has been humiliated by a catalogue of political, economic and personal crises and found himself unable to control either the public finances or the wayward antics of First Lady Valerie Trierweiler. Millionaires have been fleeing France in fear of a proposed 75 per cent tax on all earnings over one million euros. The French equivalent of the UK's Confederation of British Industry, called MEDEF, has warned the president that France risked becoming 'the poor man of Europe' over his 'disastrous' economic policies. The latest economic data shows households' spending power has fallen for the first time since 1984, and that jobless figures rose for a 22nd straight month in March to 10.6 per cent - the highest level since 1997. His girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler, 47, has also been the target of repeated media attacks since her boyfriend was elected president. A spokesman for pollsters Ifop said: 'He claimed to be the Robin Hood president who would help the poor and sweep away the corruption of the Sarkozy years. 'But he has been hit on all sides, by the economy, his policies, corruption and personal attacks. No president has ever been re-elected after falling as low as this.'","Francois Hollande ordering all ministers to publicly declare their wealth .

"Lurid claims that French First Lady . Valerie Trierweiler cheated on her former husband with Ttwo lovers at . once have been heard in a court in Paris today. The 47-year-old girlfriend of President Francois Hollande is suing two authors who made the allegations for invasion of privacy. The biography called The Troublemaker . claims she was the shared mistress of Mr Hollande, 58, and former . conservative minster Patrick Devidjian, now 68, while she was still . married to Denis Trierweiler nine years ago. Legal fight: Frances first lady Valerie Trierweiler is suing the authors of a book over claims she was a 'shared' mistress of President Francois Hollande and conservative ex-minister Patrick Devidijan . Menage a trois: It is alleged in the book that left-wing President Hollande knew . he was 'sharing' Ms Trierweiler with Patrick Devidjian during their . affair nine years ago . Both men knew they were 'sharing' Ms . Trierweiler, but when Mr Devidjian refused her demands to leave his . wife, she chose her affair with Mr Hollande over him, before finally . divorcing her husband in 2010, the book says. Ms Trierweiler is demanding £35,000 in damages for invasion of privacy from the authors Christophe . Jakubyszyn and Alix Bouilhaguet, both TV journalists. Rumour: Patrick Devedjian allegedly had an affair with Valerie Trierweiler . For legal reasons, her separate action for defamation is to be heard at a later hearing. When the case first came before a . court in December, Mr Hollande was accused of a huge abuse of his powers . by personally writing to the judge to defend his live-in lover. In the hand-written letter, the . president called the claims 'pure fabrication', adding: 'This has no . place in an account of politicial events unless it is presented as . fiction.' But furious defence lawyer Olivier . Pardo told the judge in open court: 'The separation of powers has been . violated. The President is the guardian of the independence of the . judiciary. We are swimming in madness.' Ms Trierweiler is facing a separate . bizarre legal action in France over claims the taxpayer should not be . supporting her lifestyle as the 'president's mistress'. Supermarket chain heir Xavier Kemlin . launched the highly unusual criminal complaint last week, telling French . media: 'It scandalous that our taxes are being used to house, feed, . upkeep and pay for the staff and travel of a lady to whom we have no . legal obligation.' Ms Trierweiler also recently sued a . French magazine for publishing photos of her in her bikini while on . holiday with Mr Hollande last summer - but was awarded only the . 'minimum' £5,000 in damages. The First Lady was also at the centre . of accusations last year she tried to wreck the political career of . Segolene Royal - the mother of Mr Hollande's four children. She sparked national outrage when she . tweeted her support for a candidate standing against Ms Royal in a . by-election. Ms Royal lost and said she had been 'stabbed in the back' by Mr Hollande's girlfriend. Sued: Authors Alix Bouilhaguet, pose with their book 'La Frondeuse' in which they make the extraordinary claims about French First Lady Valerie Trierweiler . Courted: The book claims that Ms Trierweiler chose Francois Hollande . over Mr Devedjian when he would not divorce his wife Sophie (pictured) Ms Trierweiler also faced humiliation in November when her boss at the French magazine where she works said he wanted to sack her.

"Neil Lennon was unveiled as Bolton’s new manager on Monday and admitted he was growing frustrated waiting to be offered a route back into management following his success at Celtic. The 43-year-old Irishman won three league titles and two Scottish Cups during his four-year spell in charge at Parkhead and also guided Celtic to the last 16 of the Champions League in 2012 on the back of a stunning home win over Barcelona. Former Celtic manager Neil Lennon has been officially unveiled as Bolton boss on Monday . Lennon takes over at the Macron Stadium after leaving Scottish Champions Celtic in the summer . Celtic: 2010-2014 . Games: 228 . Wins: 159 . Draws: 30 . Losses: 39 . After quitting in May to pursue other opportunities, however, Lennon has missed out on the managerial vacancies at Southampton, Crystal Palace, Norwich, Cardiff and Leeds. He withdrew from the running to take over at Huddersfield Town and would have held talks with Saudi Arabian club Al Ittihad had visa issues not prevented him from travelling. When it was suggested yesterday his achievements at Celtic, particularly in the Champions League, deserved more recognition, he replied: ‘You should tell that to some of the Premier League chairmen! ‘Maybe it (Scottish football) is looked down upon a little bit but we did some great things in the Champions League. The Scot, talking to the press on Monday, has a huge task at Bolton but is relishing the tough challenge ahead . Bolton are currently rooted to the bottom of the Championship but will hope Lennon can turn around results . ‘You do get a bit antsy when jobs are coming up and they pass you by. You’re thinking, “I don’t want to leave it too much longer”. I’ve been lucky in that it’s just been six months. But sooner or later it’s in your blood and you want to get back.’ Lennon accepted the offer of a three-year deal worth £600,000-a-year to succeed Dougie Freedman at Bolton, who are bottom of the Championship with just one win from 11 games. Since dropping out of the Premier League in 2012, the club’s debts have risen to £163.8million and there will not be much money to strengthen the squad. Lennon insists plenty of prominent managers have had to prove themselves in the Championship. ‘Look at the Premier League now. You’ve got Brendan Rodgers, Roberto Martinez, Paul Lambert, Steve Bruce — the list is endless of managers who have managed in the Championship. You probably have to earn your spurs to get there.’ Lennon (left) stamped his mark on his squad by ordering three players to remove hats during his first training session. He ended up wearing Owen Garvan’s hat himself. ‘I was cold, yeah, but I don’t want players training in hats because you don’t play in hats,’ said Lennon. ‘I’m not a bully, I’m not a dictator. But I will demand they come in and train and do things the right way.’ Lennon (right) formerly worked alongside Johan Mjallby at Celtic Park and the pair will now reunite at Bolton .

"Cocaine worth more than £40million has been found aboard a private jet owned by a French tycoon based in London. The vast haul of drugs was found by customs officers in the Dominican Republic on a plane owned by millionaire businessman Alain Afflelou - who was not on board at the time. Officials boarded the Falcon jet minutes before it was due to leave the Caribbean island for Paris  and seized 26 suitcases packed with 680kg of the class A drug. Drugs seizure: £40million of cocaine was found on board Alain Afflelou's Falcon jet in the Dominican Republic . Four French nationals, as well as several local police officers, were arrested after the seizure on suspicion of being part of an international drug-trafficking network. Opticians chain owner Afflelou swiftly denied all knowledge of the drugs, stating he had loaned his plane out to Lyon-based Transhelicopter Services company. A spokesman for Mr Afflelou said after the bust on Sunday: 'Alain heard the news last night through the media and he's amazed. Tycoon: Mr Afflelou denied any knowledge of the drugs and was not on board the plane at the time . 'He will now take all the necessary steps to establish what happened. A letter demanding an explanation has also been sent to the French leasing company.' Mr Afflelou, 64, sparked a storm on controversy in December when he announced he was moving to Britain amid plans for massive tax hikes on France's highest earners. The businessman - who has an estimated £190 million fortune - is among a flood of French millionaires including film star Gerard Depardieu and musician Jean-Michel Jarre quitting France ahead of a looming 75 per cent tax on earnings above one million euros. Mr Afflelou sold around 70 per cent of his shares in his retail chain to UK investment firm Bridgeport in 2006, but remained a shareholder with capital. The chain has more than 890 stores in France as well as in other European countries and sells more than a 1.5 million pairs of glasses a yer. A new report revealed yesterday said that repressive tax regimes in France had lost the country up to a million jobs, with entrepreneurs fleeing abroad. Tax hikes and employment regulations imposed by left and right wing governments over 20 years meant there were now 60,000 French businessmen abroad employing around 16 people each .","Vast haul of drugs was found by customs in the Dominican Republic .

"Glamorous French film star Julie Gayet has launched legal action over claims she is having an affair with President Francois Hollande. The blonde 40-year-old actress had filed a complaint for invasion of her privacy after the rumours surfaced on numerous French websites, her lawyer said. One website claimed Mr Hollande, 58, had confessed that Ms Gayet was his mistress during a dinner with friends at the Elysee Palace. Rumours: Julie Gayet, pictured right in at the Cannes Film Festival in 2009, and President Hollande, left . Gayet has filed a complaint against person unknown, after a rumour spread on the internet claimed she was French President Francois Hollande's mistress . The couple were said to have begun the affair after she appeared alongside him during his presidential election campaign last May, it was reported. In one campaign video, she described Hollande as 'marvellous', 'humble' and 'a really good listener'. The French media reported that a friend at one of Mr Hollande's dinner parties told one blogger: 'Julie and Francois met during his election campaign, but sadly they can't see much of each other as Valerie Trierweiler is very jealous.' Ms Gayet - a married mother-of-two who has starred in more than 50 French films - launched her legal action on March 18, her lawyer Vincent Toledano told France's AFP news agency today. He said: 'The actress Julie Gayet has instructed my chambers to take legal action over the rumour, widely disseminated on the Internet, suggesting, with no foundation, that she has a romantic relationship with the president of the republic. 'She expects her right to a private family life to be respected as there is nothing to justify these claims.'

"The breathtaking rise to prominence of Marina Granovskaia appears set to continue after Chelsea’s chief executive Ron Gourlay left the club on Wednesday. Gourlay has agreed to move on amicable terms after a decade at Stamford Bridge, including serving the last five years as chief executive. He has been focused almost entirely on the commercial aspects of the role in the recent past and the quest to meet UEFA’s Financial Fair Play targets, cut losses and improve the club’s image on a global scale. Marina Granovskaia with Didier Drogba in 2010 and the Premier League trophy, FA Cup and Community Shield . Granovskaia (left) with Drogba (and his son Isaac), Salomon Kalou (second right) and Michael Emenalo . A smiling Granovskaia, Roman Abramovich's former PA who is set to hold much more power at Chelsea . 'Chelsea Football Club announces that Ron Gourlay, after 10 successful years at the club including five as chief executive, is leaving Chelsea in order to pursue new business opportunities. 'The club, and in particular the owner (Roman Abramovich) and directors, wish to thank Ron for his many years of service to Chelsea and support his desire to seek new challenges. 'Ron's efforts have helped the club to achieve its position as one of the leading football clubs in the world. 'Pending additional appointments, chairman Bruce Buck and director Marina Granovskaia will assume additional executive responsibilities.' During this time Granovskaia, 39, a Canadian and Russian national, has gradually emerged as the most influential figure in the executive tier of the club and the voice of owner Roman Abramovich on the ground. She is trusted implicitly by Abramovich, having advised him and his companies for 17 years since graduating from Moscow State University. As Gourlay started to turn his attention towards the commercial end of the business, Granovskaia became the pivotal figure in transfer and contract negotiations and a far more familiar face around Stamford Bridge. She was central to Jose Mourinho’s return from Real Madrid and to big-money transfers such as Diego Costa’s £32million move from Atletico Madrid. Her style is perhaps best described as polite but firm, although there are stories that it went a little further than that during John Terry’s contract talks. Ron Gourlay has worked at Chelsea for 10 years, including five as chief executive . Granovskaia was often visible on the ground in Holland as links with Vitesse Arnhem were strengthened and a new training complex was built, although she is rarely seen in Arnhem now and the links between the clubs are no longer quite so strong. Over recent years, any agents turning up to meetings at the Bridge or Chelsea’s training ground in Surrey would find Granovskaia driving the meetings, increasingly active and influential at the heart of the club with a good relationship with technical director Michael Emenalo. Last year, her rise to power was made official when she was confirmed on the board of both the football club and the PLC. In the short term, Gourlay’s responsibilities will be shared between Granovskaia and chairman Bruce Buck, and in the longer term, the club may consider employing a commercial specialist to replace Gourlay, rather than a traditional CEO. Owner Abramovich, pictured celebrating against Arsenal earlier this season, wields the most power at Chelsea . Gourlay (left) pictured with Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck, who will assume additional responsibilities . 'It has been a privilege to have played a role in the club's considerable achievements both on and off the pitch over the last 10 years, but I feel the time is right to move on to other challenges. 'I would like to thank Mr Abramovich, the directors, the manager and players and all the staff for their support during my time at the club, and wish them much continued success in the future.' Gourlay’s announcement came without warning, although it emerged that plans had been unfolding for some time. The Scot watched Chelsea’s 6-0 win in the Champions League on Tuesday before attending a UEFA meeting and sharing a drink with colleagues. He was at the Bridge on Wednesday tidying up loose ends, but leaves with immediate effect ‘in order to pursue new business opportunities’, according to a statement released by Chelsea. ‘The club, and in particular the owner and directors, wish to thank Ron for his many years of service to Chelsea and support his desire to seek new challenges,’ the statement added. ‘Ron’s efforts have helped the club to achieve its position as one of the leading football clubs in the world.’ The Chelsea chief executive pictured with former England manager Fabio Capello at Stamford Bridge . He took over in September 2009, stepping up from his role as chief operating officer to replace Peter Kenyon, with whom he had also worked at Umbro. Among his first tasks was an attempt to secure naming rights for Stamford Bridge, which went down terribly with Chelsea fans and never came to fruition. On a more positive note, the team won the Champions League on his watch, and recorded a small profit in 2012 — perhaps an even more remarkable achievement, all things considered. He did manage to increase revenue from sponsorship deals such as those with adidas, Gazprom and Delta, while wrestling with the problem posed by the 42,000 capacity at the ground and complications involved in expanding or finding a suitable site for a new home. ‘It has been a privilege to have played a role in the club’s considerable achievements both on and off the pitch over the last 10 years, but I feel the time is right to move on to other challenges,’ said Gourlay in a statement. ‘I would like to thank Mr Abramovich, the directors, the manager and players and all the staff for their support during my time at the club, and wish them much continued success in the future.’","Granovskaia has emerged as the most influential figure in the executive tier of Chelsea and the voice of owner Roman Abramovich on the ground .

"France’s Prime Minister has ordered his cabinet to stop using English after two colleagues named a new proposal the ‘silver economy’. Jean-Marc Ayrault wrote a sternly-worded letter telling ministers: 'The language of the republic is French.' The PM’s edict comes after the French culture ministry to issued a list of English words to be banned from their language, including ‘email’, ‘blog’, ‘supermodel’, ‘take-away’ and ‘low-cost airline’. 'The language of the republic is French': French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayraulth as ordered his cabinet to stop using English after two colleagues named a new proposal the ¿silver economy¿ . Now Mr Ayrault has told ministers: 'Our language is able to express every contemporary reality, and describe innovations that are constantly being born in the areas of science and technology. 'French has been inscribed in the constitution since 1992 as the language of administration and of the courts.' The ‘Silver Economy’ is a plan being proposed by industry minister Arnaud Montebourg and pensioners’ minister Michele Delaunay to group together all businesses related to older generations. One of their advisers attempted to justify the now-forbidden term saying: 'The English term seems to us most appropriate for a sector planning to expand exports'. In January, France’s official language police, the Academie Francaise called for the French to stop using the words ‘hashtag’ and ‘cloud computing’. Two years ago the Academie issued a 65-page black-list of English words, including obscure terms like ‘shadow-boxing’, ‘detachable motor caravan’ and ‘multifunctional industrial building’. Senior French government adviser Herve Bourges warned at the time that the global domination of Anglo-Saxon culture had plunged the future of the French language into crisis. He said: 'French is being besieged by the growing numbers of English speakers around the world. 'English speakers have a vision of the so-called English-speaking world, but an equivalent concept does not seem to exist in France. 'Despite having 200 million French speakers on earth, the idea of a French-speaking world is becoming obsolete.' Traitors: Industrial minister Arnaud Montebourg, centre, and minister for the elderly Michele Delaunay, right, pose with rapporteur Jerome Arnaud holding their report upon the 'Silver Economy' Education minister Luc Chatel sparked outrage last year when he announced plans to start teaching English to French schoolchildren from as young as the age of three. Mr Chatel told i-Tele TV: 'The French are bad at speaking English and this is a true weakness of our country.' And French academic Claudia Senik caused more anger among language purists in February when she said French people would be less miserable if they spoke more English and other foreign languages.",Edict comes after two ministers launched new policy on the 'Silver Economy'
"Half a point. That’s all it was. World No 1, and world No 3, played as a team over 36 holes. Half a point. Yet somehow, in the dwindling light of day one at Gleneagles, it felt almost like a win. Rory McIlroy and Sergio Garcia were the Ryder Cup’s marquee pairing. They were Paul McGinley’s banker, without equal in either team on current form. Yet standing on the 17th tee, they were two down with two to play, having already lost their morning session. Garcia was staring at the worst day of his life as a Ryder Cup player. He had been sent out morning and afternoon on nine previous occasions and had never drawn a blank. Now it was a real possibility. Rory McIlroy (right) and Sergio Garcia celebrate with a high five as the pair salvage half a point on Friday . Sergio Garcia (right) and Rory McIlroy managed to salvage half a point for Europe against their USA opponents . Rory McIlroy and Sergio Garcia weren't at their best for Europe as they took just half a point against USA . This shows why starting right is always a good idea! His shot at 17 was reasonable, then, but not exceptional. It made the green of the 194-yard par three, but with plenty left. Right to left, hole on a different tier. McIlroy, now playing the alternate shot, had it all to do. And, frankly, McIlroy hadn’t been doing much all day. He drained it. Possibly the putt of the day, due to its complexity. Dead centre, too. So Europe were still in the game, heading down the last. McIlroy, buoyed, took out his new prototype driver. The Nike Vapor. So called, one might suspect, because it had been a steaming nuisance all afternoon. And it was again. Yet it was US captain Tom Watson who said that golf was not meant to be a fair game, and here was proof of it. McIlroy went savagely right, but good fortune intervened, gave him a handy rebound off a pine tree and a lie for Garcia that was far better than deserved. He played his best shot of the round, perhaps of the day, a three-wood out of the rough to the back off the green. McIlroy sprinted across the fairway to celebrate. America, meanwhile, found sand at the front. They bogeyed, Europe got down in two to win the hole and the game was halved. Viewed dispassionately it was a poor return from Europe’s strongest pairing. In that moment, however, it was the catalyst for much rejoicing. When Phil Mickelson, five times a major winner, begins checking his green maps while standing over a three foot putt, it is fair to assume he is feeling a little tense. Even on the first morning of the first day, the Ryder Cup has that effect. It is no respecter of reputations, of grand slams, of world rankings. It plays by different rules. It makes heroes of less than stratospheric talents like Ian Poulter, and fools of all-time greats like Tiger Woods. So, really, the thought that McIlroy and Garcia would sweep all before them simply because they are better than just about everyone else here, is bunkum. Rory McIlroy and Sergio Garcia were in buoyant mood on Friday evening after the day's play had ended . Rory McIlroy and Sergio Garcia joke around in a Friday evening press conference after the day's play had ended . 7.35am: Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson v Bubba Watson and Matt Kuchar . 7.50am: Jamie Donaldson and Lee Westwood v Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan . 8.05am: Thomas Bjorn and Martin Kaymer v Patrick Reed and Jordan Spieth . 8.20am: Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter v Jimmy Walker and Rickie Fowler . CLICK HERE FOR SPORTSMAIL'S VERDICTS OF SATURDAY'S EUROPE VS USA PAIRINGS . Sure enough, while Garcia turned the air blue on the 15th tee, he did not have the same impact on the board. Europe are in the box seat, leading 5-3 after day one, but McIlroy and Garcia’s contribution was as small as it could be. They lost the morning fourball to Mickelson and Keegan Bradley, halved the foursome with Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker. So much for the dream team, then. McIlroy was largely ineffectual, Garcia erratic. Even when put in good positions he failed to take advantage, and he left McIlroy in trouble too many times to mention. The 15th, when Garcia’s language captured his feelings as emotively as his grim visage, was a case in point. With the pair’s second shot, McIlroy could do no more than bludgeon the ball back onto the fairway. In his head, he was perhaps uttering a few colourful phrases of his own. If there was a hangover from the morning session, it was perhaps understandable. European golfers no longer choke on the last hole in Ryder Cups. At Medinah two years ago, 12 matches went down the 18th and Europe collected nine-and-a-half points from those encounters. So when Mickelson sank his tiddler winning putt after neither of Europe’s prime partnership had reached a par-five green in regulation three, it would have sent a disturbing and unfamiliar shiver through the home camp. Garcia had chipped worryingly from rough into a bunker, but by then McGinley had already named his pairings for the foursomes, with both men retained as a team. Had they bombed a second time it would have felt like a tactical error, even if Europe would still have had their noses in front. Sergio Garcia swings during Friday morning's defeat against USA's Keegan Bradley and Phil Mickelson . Rory McIlroy finds himself in a corner during Europe's loss to USA's Keegan Bradley and Phil Mickelson . Europe started Friday morning frustratingly but managed to claw their way back to earn a two-point lead . Without doubt, McGinley was looking to this duo as standard-bearers. Yet, largely, the standard was poor. Mickelson and Bradley were hardly bringing their A game either, as evidenced by their foursomes defeat later in the day. So the morning fourball was definitely a game Europe could have won had McIlroy, in particular, delivered even an approximation of the ability that has taken him to the pinnacle of golf’s rankings. Instead, America were allowed to clean up at the death. Europe led by a hole coming away from the 15th, but Bradley eagled the 16th and Mickelson did the rest. ‘Find McIlroy and break him,’ was the instruction of Paul Azinger, the last American captain to win the Ryder Cup — and the afternoon session showed how close Tom Watson’s players came to doing that. At the very least, it is hard to see how Garcia and McIlroy could have remained together at any stage on Saturday had they drawn a duck egg from close to 12 hours of golf on Friday. Not that Mickelson and Bradley are a weak unit. By the end of the morning session, they had become the first American pair since Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins in 1979 to win four Ryder Cup games straight. Yet the golf played on Friday did not have to be from the stars. High afternoon winds and higher anxiety saw to that and anyone expecting a masterclass from players of such pedigree would have left this corner of Perthshire sorely disappointed. Sergio Garcia and Rory McIlroy will not be paired for Saturday morning's fourballs in the 2014 Ryder Cup .

Far from an exhibition, the morning session in particular was more of a dust-up, a bundle in the playground. The match fluctuated because the performances fluctuated, and wildly. McIlroy played the first hole like the world No 1, and the second like a player 500 places his inferior. He made precious few interventions worthy of his reputation, winning the 13th and 15th holes, to take the game from two down to all square, but on both occasions with straightforward pars to American bogeys. Perhaps this was why, with so many great players struggling to find form, the residue of the last few days was forgotten. There was none of the predicted needle left over from the phoney war of words that invariably precedes this event. Was McIlroy still smarting over Mickelson’s jibe about his legal complications? It did not look like it. On the short buggy ride up to the ninth tee, the pair shared a back seat and Mickelson put his arm around the shoulders of his young rival, laughing. McIlroy smiled back. They were both probably in need of consolation at that point. The Ryder Cup does that to people. Unlike McIlroy and Garcia, as a contest, it does not do things by halves.

"Mario Balotelli was too hot for England in Manaus. He may not be in the class of Luis Suarez — although he’s probably not inferior to the tune of £59million, as their transfer fees suggest — but he is still a goalscorer capable of defining a match from nowhere, and every title-chasing team needs at least one. As football becomes increasingly mired in five-man midfields, the biggest games will be decided by one moment of individual genius. There is no doubt Balotelli is capable of providing that. Yet he is still a risk, no matter how many assurances his new employers require. It is not what Balotelli does that is the problem, but the tension his maverick presence can create. Inbound: Will Mario Balotelli (left) and Angel Di Maria (right) fire Liverpool and Manchester United to glory?

Popular: Balotelli signs autographs for Liverpool supporters after leaving Melwood training ground on Friday . Smile for the cameras: Balotelli waves as he arrives at Melwood for his medical on Friday . When Balotelli was at Manchester City it seemed the club was never out of the headlines. It wasn’t ‘Why always me?’ but ‘Why always us?’ — and there is enough pressure on Liverpool already this season without Balotelli drawing the eyes of the world to Anfield. It is no coincidence Liverpool’s best season was also Suarez’s quietest off the field. Liverpool need to go about their business this season with the minimum of commotion: Balotelli has all the gift for tranquility of a 10-year-old with a birthday drum kit. Ordered off: Former Manchester City striker Balotelli is shown a red card against Arsenal in 2012 . Business as usual: Liverpool players train at Melwood on Sunday ahead of their match against Manchester City . So, where does Di Maria fit in? Angel Di Maria was as good as any player at Real Madrid last season, even Cristiano Ronaldo. One imagines if coach Carlo Ancelotti had control over transfer policy he would not be on his way out. Madrid need to feed the brand image annually, however, and James Rodriguez was one of the stars of the World Cup. So he’s in and Di Maria is out — and Manchester United are the beneficiaries. Di Maria’s fee, anywhere between £60million and £75m depending on reports, would put him up with the greatest players in the world. Is he worth that? Perhaps to a club that needs a world-class attacking wide player to complete their vision. Is that Manchester United, though, particularly when Louis van Gaal’s game plan calls for wing-backs? Where, for instance, does this leave Adnan Januzaj, the one bright spark for United last season? Can Di Maria and Januzaj protect a back three? And what then happens to Luke Shaw? On the move? Real Madrid star Di Maria looks set to sign for Manchester United this week . In the last transfer window, United responded to growing frustration with the £37m marquee signing of Juan Mata from Chelsea. At the time it looked a great buy, if costly. Yet it quickly became plain that United’s problems lay elsewhere. Di Maria? He’s a brilliant, energetic, creative forward that any club would be lucky to have. But Manchester United, for the same fee as Luis Suarez? Is this their priority? The jury is out.

"Click here for your ultimate stats guide, including how Ciro Immobile's opening goal was all his own work . And right here was the reason the Champions League seedings have got to change next year. Arsenal are about as close to being among the top eight teams in Europe as Borussia Dortmund’s mighty and magnificent Westfalenstadion is to a wet Wednesday at Gresty Road, Crewe. They were outclassed in Germany, outplayed, at times torn apart, reduced to an imitation of a team that UEFA blithely placed in Pot 1 when the draw was made earlier this month. Arsenal have no business sitting beside the champions of Europe and the Goliaths of the strongest European leagues right now. Borussia Dortmund striker Ciro Immobile finishes off a great run by steering the ball past Laurent Koscielny and into the net . Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scores his side's second goal after streaking clear of the Arsenal defence . Aubameyang (left) and Immobile, Dortmund's two goalscorers, celebrate after the latter's strike put the hosts two up . BORUSSIA DORTMUND (4-2-3-1): Weidenfeller 6; Durm 7, Subotic 6.5, Sokratis 6, Schmelzer 7 (Jojic 79); Bender 7, Kehl 6.5 (Ginter 46, 6); Aubameyang 7.5, Mkhitaryan 8, Grosskreutz 7; Immobile 7.5 (Ramos 86). Booked: Mkhitaryan. Subs not used: Langerak, Amini, Bandowski, Kagawa. Manager: Jurgen Klopp 7.

Subs not used: Ospina, Chambers, Rosicky, Campbell. Booked: Wilshere. Manager: Arsene Wenger 6. Man of the match: Henrikh Mkhitarayan . Referee: Olegario Benquerenca (Por) 6.5 . Ratings by MATT BARLOW at the Westfalenstadion . They have been allowed to make the most of an impressive run of qualifications and the odd foray into the last eight, but this can no longer hide the reality. The scoreline did not flatter Borussia Dortmund. Their margin of victory could have been doubled, even trebled, without complaint. Their opening goal, in the final minute of the first-half, was their 15th attempt – and if anything their chances after half-time were better, if less frequent. They totalled 22 by the time referee Olegario Benquerenca of Portugal called a halt to a very one-sided contest. Quicker, sharper, more intelligent, with greater determination at the back, quite simply Dortmund should not be this far ahead. Jurgen Klopp is a fine coach, but he presides over a club that is constantly battling to keep its finest players, often without success. The best are picked off, by Bayern Munich or the elite of England’s Premier League – Arsenal would fancy their chances of getting a player out of Dortmund every time, as they once did with Tomas Rosicky. Yet the Germans were on a different plane. Only mistakes in front of goal stopped this being a painfully sobering rout. As it was, even the appearance of a 19-year-old rookie, Hector Bellerin, at right back cannot excuse Arsenal’s inferiority. Nothing that happened was Bellerin’s fault; and Dortmund were missing Marco Reus and Mats Hummels. Yes, Arsenal had the odd chance, too – but even this meagre resistance raised more questions than answers, all falling to new signing Danny Welbeck, who did little to refute Louis van Gaal’s criticisms of him. The Dutchman, not reluctant to back his judgement even in the worst of times, may be saying that he told us so. Arsenal were desperate for a striker to supplement the injured Olivier Giroud, but their problems run deeper than that. Mikel Arteta was deployed to guard the back four, but that is not his natural role and it showed. Dortmund were too quickly into the heart of Arsenal’s defence; any team of attacking quality will enjoy playing against them now. Arsene Wenger was once invincible with men like Patrick Vieira in midfield. It seems incredible that he no longer finds such physically imposing figures relevant to how Arsenal play. The goals summed up Arsenal’s malaise. The first was horridly soft and come from a bungled visitors' throw-in. Possession was lost, the ball was cleared and Ciro Immobile picked it up inside his own half.

Arsenal Arsene Wenger signals to the referee that the Dortmund star dived . Confounding those who love to mock his rather unfortunate surname, he began a run that took him through a very half-hearted Arsenal midfield and into the path of Laurent Koscielny. The centre half – outstanding here last season – put in a lame challenge which Immobile shrugged off easily, before striking the ball across Wojciech Szczesny in goal. It was no more than Dortmund deserved. They had been by far the best team until that point. The second was little better from Arsenal’s perspective. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, French born but playing for his father’s country, Gabon, had been wasteful in the first half but he made amends three minutes after the restart. A ball from substitute Matthias Ginter caused unnecessary confusion in the Arsenal ranks, allowing Aubameyang to nip in ahead of Per Mertesacker, round Szczesny and finish smartly as Koscielny collided with a post in a frantic attempt to block on the line. And, yes, it could have been worse. So much worse. Immobile nearly grabbed his second, forcing an outstanding one-handed save from Szczesny, Aubameyang had another shot hit the bar, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan lashed one over when a cooler head would surely have netted Dortmund’s third.

The first-half had been equally frustrating for Dortmund, not least after 27 minutes when Aubameyang failed to take advantage of a lovely move that saw his team-mates switch the play from right to left. Erik Durm, Sebastian Kehl and Kevin Grosskreutz were all involved before the ball found its way back into the centre where Aubameyang was charging towards the target. He shot first time, but straight at Szczesny from close range. Soon after, again picking up on a pass from Kehl, Aubameyang forced another good save from the Arsenal goalkeeper. Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Mkhitaryan also wasted decent chances. Arsenal barely got a look in. When they did, Welbeck disappointed. After 31 minutes a cross from Alexis Sanchez eluded Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, only for the ball to get trapped beneath Welbeck’s feet at the far post. His second miss was more glaring. Put through by Ramsey, with only Weidenfeller to beat, his finish was snatched and wide. In the second-half, he had a last chance to apply pressure but demonstrated only the inconsistency that supports Van Gaal’s decision to sell. Everything about his build-up play – his run, his touch – was lovely, but the finish was that of a novice, panicked, and a long way over. Dortmund were equally loose but their sheer volume of goalmouth opportunities ultimately won the game. With chances limited, Welbeck’s misses stood out. There is a way to go yet, obviously, but Arsenal may already be eyeing second place in Group D. Galatasaray are the next opponents, at the Emirates Stadium, and a win is vital, if only to regain their confidence in European competition. This was a humbling night.

For a body so keen on fairness, the concept goes out of the window whenever the dead hand of UEFA reaches for its little balls in bowls. The elite are protected so that Arsenal, who last won the title in 2004 and needed to pre-qualify this year, are shielded from the toughest opposition, while Manchester City, reigning champions with two title wins in three years, must again climb a mountain to reach the later stages. It is warped. Bent in favour of the established elite so that there were more champions in pots B and D than in marquee pot A. This produces ferociously unfair match-ups. Every team in Group A, for instance, are national champions — Atletico Madrid, Juventus, Olympiacos and Malmo — while Arsenal and Chelsea have to contend with a single league winner apiece, Anderlecht of Belgium for Arsene Wenger, Maribor of Slovenia for Chelsea.

The whole process reeks of protectionism. Michel Platini, UEFA president, says he will address this at the next Champions League summit, but then bleats that he needs the permission of the clubs to change. He means the old, rich ones of course — it is not as if the others matter. The co-efficient rankings that are used to insure the most powerful against their mediocrity could equally be used to implement a fairer competition. UEFA’s points system also reveals the identity of the strongest leagues in club competition — currently Spain, England, Germany, Portugal, Italy, Russia and France. So the champions of those countries should be the seven top seeds, plus the Champions League holders. This would create a more egalitarian pot A, comprising Atletico Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Benfica, Juventus, CSKA Moscow, Paris Saint Germain and Real Madrid. Fairer already.

Pot B would then be taken from the champions of the next eight leagues off the rank, if they had qualified – meaning Ukraine (Shakhtar Donetsk), Holland (Ajax), Belgium (Anderlecht), Switzerland (Basle) and Greece (Olympiacos), plus the second-placed teams from Spain (Barcelona), England (Liverpool) and Germany (Borussia Dortmund). Using this system, pot C would be Malmo, BATE Borisov, Apoel Nicosia, Sporting Lisbon, Roma, Zenit St Petersburg, Monaco and Chelsea, and pot D the remainder, including Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen, who cannot surely expect to come fourth and be seeded any higher. That way there would be genuine movement in the rankings, and fresh match-ups each year. And, yes, under that system Manchester City could end up with Olympiacos, Apoel Nicosia and Ludogorets Razgrad and Arsenal with Real Madrid, Ajax and Roma — but as one team won its league and the other came fourth, why should it be any other way? This is the Champions League. That title should mean something. Champions of Europe: Real Madrid won the competition for the 10th time in their history last season .

How is that healthy, or compelling? When the Champions League began it felt exotic and new, now the group stage only gets interesting if one of the big boys messes up. It is a routine revenue-generating process, there to fill TV primetime and only undertaken as a means to an end. We know the serious stuff begins after Christmas, once a free draw heralds the arrival of the knock-out stage. Deep down, that is what football’s establishment fears, of course: not being good enough, not being up to the test. It is to UEFA’s shame that they then indulge this naked protectionism.

"Sixes and fours?: Mrs Justice Beverley Lang, sitting in London, has been a High Court judge since 2011 . A planning battle over an old village forge next to a cricket pitch yesterday led to a High Court judge asking: ‘What are sixes and fours?’ East Meon Forge and Cricket Ground Protection Association is challenging East Hampshire District Council’s decision to grant planning permission for an extension with a residential first floor over the single-storey former blacksmith’s workshop. Robert Fookes, appearing for the association, said that one of the grounds of objection to the development was that the forge was very close to the square on which cricket is played. He told Mrs Justice Beverley Lang ‘sixes and fours are frequently hit by batsmen on to forge land, including the roof of the building itself’. However, the baffled 59-year-old judge, sitting at London’s High Court, said: ‘I don’t play cricket - what does that mean?’ Mr Fookes replied that sixes were scored in cricket when the ball was hit over the boundary without hitting the ground, while fours ‘bounced along the ground’ before crossing the boundary line. He added that six runs or four runs were scored automatically without the batsman having to run the runs. Mrs Justice Lang made no further comment on the game and the court turned to consider the dimensions of the controversial development in East Meon, in the South Downs National Park. The judge was educated at Wycombe Abbey School and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where she is an honorary fellow. She has been a High Court judge since 2011. Dispute: East Meon Forge and Cricket Ground Protection Association is challenging a decision to grant planning permission for an extension with a residential first floor over the single-storey former blacksmith’s workshop . Chairman of East Meon Forge and Cricket Ground Protection Association (EMFCPA) George Bartlett said: ‘There are a large number of people in East Meon who have a great attachment to the old forge as an important part of the village’s heritage and feel that the proposed development is a gross over-development on this tiny site and is out of keeping with the surrounding properties in this conservation area. ‘It will cause even greater traffic problems on this narrow and blind bend in the road and will threaten the playing of cricket and other sport on the adjoining cricket ground.’ Mr Fookes told the judge that the brick-built forge with its tiled roof dated back to 1869 and was on Hampshire County Council's list of ‘treasures’, which meant its destruction would be a serious loss to the heritage of the county. In 2009 English Heritage considered that, while it did not fulfil the criteria for listing for preservation, it was of local importance and should be protected. Mr Fookes said the planning permission under challenge was granted to the current owners of the forge in April, and was the third application to be made for the site. Aerial view: The court heard that one of the grounds of objection to the development was that the forge (circled) was very close to the square on which cricket is played . He said the first application was subsequently withdrawn. The second was granted in September 2013 for a large extension with a residential first floor over the old blacksmith's workshop. The proposal raised concerns and was quashed by consent. The third, very similar application was then made and approved by the local planning authority. Mr Fookes argued that the proposal was contrary to relevant planning policy. The cricket club, ‘an important village institution’ composed almost entirely of village residents, was also extremely concerned that it could jeopardise the long-term use of the cricket ground. The forge was at the entrance to the ground and very close to the square on which the wickets were pitched. As a result sixes and fours were frequently hit on to the forge land, including the roof of the building itself. Mr Fookes argued that this was not a concern while the building remained undeveloped. Education: The judge attended Wycombe Abbey School (left) and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford (right), where she is an honorary fellow . But there would be potential for damage and injury to people if an additional storey for residential use were to be built with windows overlooking the ground, as well as roof-lights and an open decked area. He contended the future of the cricket club would come under threat as it would be liable for any damage to the building and its occupants caused by batsmen hitting balls over the boundary. David Forsdick QC, appearing for the district council, said the legal challenge should be dismissed. He told the judge the council had granted planning permission for alterations to the forge on behalf of the South Downs National Park Authority. He said the forge's lawful use was as an industrial building, but it was not in use and was in poor condition. In essence the approved plan was to secure its future by repairing it and bringing it back into use, with living accommodation on the new first floor. Steps had been taken to address the cricket club's concerns, said Mr Forsdick. Advice from Sports England had led to an acceptable scheme of conditions to deal with those concerns. The case continues today.","East Meon Forge and Cricket Ground group is challenging council move .

"Marcos Rojo is on his way to Manchester United, we are told. He needs to be. Not just for Louis van Gaal, as the deficiencies in his squad bite.

He failed to deliver in his new role every bit as much as the manager, but had huge credit with the Glazers from his previous work at the club. It was easier to remove Moyes and keep the executive who had almost doubled United’s commercial revenue. Van Gaal’s track record, however, makes him an unlikely fall guy. There was no prior evidence that Moyes was a title-winning manager, but that is not true of Van Gaal. History suggests that given the tools, he succeeds. This time the blame rebounds on his floundering facilitator. The Glazers will not wish to lose the services of the admired Woodward - but they may prefer him to return to his area of expertise.

It was never going to be easy to replace Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand, but at least the club had lead time. It has been known for eight months that Vidic was leaving and Ferdinand’s performances increasingly represented the end of an era. There should have been planning. Rojo and Daley Blind of Ajax, should have already been in the team come Saturday’s match with Swansea City. The pursuit of Angel di Maria would appear to be a recent, opportunistic request by Van Gaal. After an outstanding season with Real Madrid, few would have thought he would be available this summer. It makes sense to take advantage of Madrid’s overcrowded roster. Slow to act: United have failed to replace Rio Ferdinand (left) or Nemanja Vidic (right) in defence this season . World star: Rojo was a member of the Argentina squad that finished as runners up at this summer's World Cup . Overhaul: United and Van Gaal need to strengthen the squad in order to tackle some serious deficiencies . Yet replacing Vidic and Ferdinand? That should have been done long ago. Shorn of European competition this season, Manchester United have been reduced to paying outlandish sums and can ill-afford another season out of the Champions League. Yet they are already playing catch-up on their rivals. The worry, if the defence cannot be overhauled successfully at this late stage, is that they end up with what is available, rather than what they need. Woodward has to get his business done, and quickly. If not, the consequences for the club, and their executive vice-chairman, are potentially status-changing.

"As the players retreated to the pavilion in dwindling light, it was clear that one Test team had again increased its standing on day one at The Oval. Australia. What a job they did on England in the winter, that Alastair Cook and his colleagues should have made such hard work of these Indian tourists this summer. How did Cook nearly lose his job, and his marbles, to this lot? How were England staring at a series defeat coming out of that second Test at Lord’s? Australia really did a number on England in the last Ashes series. Shaken: Alastair Cook and England have made hard work of the five-Test series against India this summer . Stirred: Australia did such a number on England that their confidence was shaken going up against India . CLICK HERE TO READ THE REPORT FROM ENGLAND V INDIA DAY ONE AT THE OVAL . It has taken them to here, almost, to recover their confidence and swagger. India’s failed attempt to wage disciplinary war on James Anderson after Trent Bridge appears to have united England and, in doing so, healed some of the wounds of the winter. Until that point, Australia had rendered England vulnerable and meek, their captain a shell of himself, even the younger members of the squad catching the fear that seemed to pervade the dressing-room at the first hint of crisis. Some fragility remains. England are still at risk from a tail-end with its dander up and in the last two years have given up 50 runs or more to the 10th-wicket partnership on eight occasions. So it was here. The stand between India’s captain MS Dhoni and the returning fast bowler Ishant Sharma was worth 58 from 98 balls, the most successful Indian pairing of the day by a margin of 34. England seem unable to get the job finished under pressure — a remnant, perhaps, of a similar failing in the back-to-back Ashes series. There is no doubt Australia hurt them and one wonders in what direction this series would have swung had their opponents been made of sterner stuff. As it is, India have lived down to the national stereotype, lousy tourists lacking the appetite for the challenge presented by a five-Test series. Increasingly, there is a disconnect between these countries. In England, the Test is valued above all, the one-day game a lucrative sideshow. Yet Indian cricketers are revered through the IPL competition, and the limited overs internationals are the only ones that now fill stadiums to capacity and beyond. Bowler: The war against Jimmy Anderson after Trent Bridge appears to have united England together . Recovery: Anderson's row with India went a long way to helping England turn the corner in the five-Test series . Some think India will be more engaged this summer once the long-form fixtures are done. What a pity. It makes the events of July, when England struggled so pitifully, ever more mysterious. England bowled extremely well on Friday— as impressively as they have done in this campaign — yet without doubt India have lost their edge. ‘Believe me, they are not this bad,’ Sunil Gavaskar wailed during his commentary, as wickets fell with alarming regularity. Yet they are. Any team that loses its focus is precisely this bad. And England lost their way in Australia this winter. Battered into submission, they became every bit as clueless as India were on Friday, a malaise that has taken close to six months to shake off. They are coming out of the slump now, slowly. Chris Jordan opened his first spell with two wicket maidens, the first time an England bowler has made that happen since Monty Panesar against Pakistan in 2006. In the circumstances, then, the innings played by Dhoni in defiance of England’s bowlers was a small wonder. It can be argued that he should be doing more as captain to inspire this squad, but his performance with the bat on Friday was the definition of resistance. Chris Jordan's two wicket maidens was an England bowler's first since Monty Panesar over Pakistan in 2006 . Dhoni made 82 in a total score of 148, the first time an Indian captain has been responsible for more than 50 per cent of his team’s total. His ally, Sharma, made just seven in a stand of 58. Sharma rode his luck, as did India, dropped by Ian Bell just five balls into his innings with the score on 95. Had India failed to make three figures, however, there really could have been no complaints, but then The Oval crowd would have missed Dhoni’s knock which included 15 fours, plus a six off the mercurial Jordan. The sight of his team-mates playing like men with scarce interest in the art of Test batting only put Dhoni’s achievement in sharper relief. He was the sole Indian batsman who played as if not ticking off the days to Heathrow’s departure lounge. Strange, considering India have close to three weeks of one-day cricket remaining when the final Test is over. Proud: MS Dhoni looks like one of the few Indian batsmen that doesn't have his eyes fixed on Heathrow yet . Dhoni's 82 was the first time an Indian captain was responsible for more than 50 per cent of his team’s total . Priorities? India have close to three weeks of one-day cricket remaining when this final Test is over . This was the match in which Jimmy Anderson could realistically overtake Sir Ian Botham’s record of 383 Test wickets. He began the game on 376, needing only eight in two innings to be crowned England’s greatest bowler (although, as Botham archly observed, that still leaves him 15 Test centuries shy of true parity). When Anderson claimed the wicket of Gautam Gambhir after just four balls of play, it appeared the milestone could be on — certainly over two innings — but India, too willing to give up their wickets, soon dashed that hope. Anderson’s quest was quickly hampered by a fairer division of the spoils with Stuart Broad (two), Jordan (three) and Chris Woakes (three) all successful. Anderson picked up the spare. As England’s opening partnership steered a way past India’s 10th-wicket benchmark of 58, the narrative became increasingly familiar. Given the meagre nature of India’s score they needed to send England to bed two or three wickets down, but there is no Mitchell Johnson to inspire fear and an early breakthrough. India will claim they were cursed by misfortune when Cook looked to be out lbw to Bhuvneshwar Kumar with the score on 20. The appeal was rejected, much to Kumar’s fury, yet with no DRS to correct errors, India simply had to live with it. This is not the first time Cook has benefited from a little luck in this Test series. By next summer, he could be back to his best. He will need to be. Australia are here again, and they are better than this bunch; either of them, on the evidence of the passing summer. Help: Anderson shared the wicket spoils with Stuart Broad (two), Jordan (three) and Chris Woakes (three) Record in sight: Anderson needs six more in order to overtake Sir Ian Botham’s record of 383 Test wickets .","Australia shook England up so much that Alastair Cook and England have made hard work of the five-Test series against India .

"Steven Gerrard has retired from international football after 114 caps and last month, just before his final cap, Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel wrote about how England failed their captain. It is pointless asking Steven Gerrard where it all goes wrong. Gerrard is where it all goes wrong. Not just in this tournament, not just with the odd mistake of a player raging against the dying of the  light, but from the very start, from his earliest days as an international footballer. All those times when we looked and wondered what happened to the Gerrard we knew, the one in the red shirt, a hero of the modern game. That was it going wrong. That was it right there. VIDEO Scroll down for Steven Gerrard: The World Cup has left me a broken man . Ruined: Steven Gerrard has retired from international football following failure at the 2014 World Cup . Stepping away: The 34-year-old has called time on his England career after 114 caps . Name Gerrard’s greatest performance for Liverpool. It is impossible to stop at one. The second half of the 2005 Champions League final; the FA Cup final in 2006; that Champions League tie against Olympiacos in 2004; the 3-0 win over Everton in 2012; Napoli in the Europa League in 2010; as a 21-year-old against Manchester United in 2001. Anfield regulars would not stop there. They could add another 50, maybe 100. Southampton, New Year’s Day, 2001; Marseille in 2008. Games that Liverpool would not have won without Gerrard, the pumping heartbeat. Now do the same with Gerrard and England. Several of those who have seen each one of his 113 appearances tried it yesterday. There was a consensus on Andorra away in 2007 under Steve McClaren. And not a whole lot else. He was very good when England beat Germany 5-1 in Munich, but so were a lot of players. There was a friendly against Hungary immediately after the 2010 World Cup, when he stopped the Fabio Capello backlash reaching its shrill crescendo. And he was most consistent in the qualifying campaign for the 2010 World Cup, albeit in a starting position on the left, which he hated. Glorious: Many Gerrard displays for Liverpool, particularly in Istanbul in 2005, have been outstanding . Irregular: There have been fewer great displays for England, with the best arguably against Andorra in 2007 . Yet Gerrard’s malaise is England malaise. Just as the national team is less than the sum of its parts, so his century of England appearances do not amount to his best 10, maybe his best five, for Liverpool. Gerrard, an admirable individual of great honesty and often given to brutal self-analysis, admits as much. On the occasion of his 100th cap, he said he had played six or seven good games for England. That was harsh. It is generally agreed Gerrard has frequently hit a standard that justifies his inclusion. Only very recently has his place in the team been questioned, and never by Roy Hodgson. He has asked Gerrard to stay as captain, and he will consider his future in the coming weeks. Yet it is impossible to divorce Gerrard’s legacy as a player from the decade or so of underachievement from what was a highly promising England group. ‘If we can’t make this one a player, we might as well give up,’ Sir Alex Ferguson once said, viewing the young Ryan Giggs. Looking back on Gerrard’s international career, it would appear the England machine has failed even that simple challenge. It has taken one of the greatest England footballers of this, or any, generation, one of the most talented players in the world, the midfielder Luis Suarez says is the greatest he has played with, and somehow reduced him to mediocrity. Tortured: England captain Gerrard looked injured mentally when he faced the press on Sunday . Flattered to deceive: Wayne Rooney is another player who fails to replicate club form for his country . It is as if someone has pulled the plug on The Beatles, chucked a blanket over Gainsborough, brought the curtain down on Larry Olivier. This is one of the finest footballers we will ever see. And we’re harking back to a golden hour against Andorra. Gerrard looked pained on Sunday. Injured, mentally more than physically. He picked at the back of his leg until he drew blood, and his face was wrinkled so intensely a bicycle could have been parked in one of the furrows on his brow. He recalled the afternoon after the night before, flicking around on his hotel television, back and forth, checking on Italy’s game with Costa Rica in the hope there might be one last lifeline. It wasn’t to be. Gerrard gave the impression he half expected as much. ‘There was a small, tiny glimmer, but that made the pain even worse when the game was gone,’ he said. ‘It was a desperate position to be in. 'To me, that’s not good enough, to be relying on others, when you’ve got the talented players we have in this squad. 'The margins are smaller now from where we were two years ago but, sitting here, we’re bitterly disappointed. It’s killing me not to have any positives to speak about.’ VIDEO Gerrard to take time over retirement decision . Fighting back: England manager Roy Hodgson (right) wants Gerrard (left) to remain as his captain . Dead rubber: England and Gerrard trained ahead of the Costa Rica match on Tuesday . England are all about accentuating the positives in Brazil, but it seems so empty in the wake of the poorest performance at a World Cup since 1958. The margins are small, was yesterday’s mantra. Yet in three hours of football, England have not been ahead in a match, once. The group of death myth has also been exploded. No group of death is won by Costa Rica, as seems likely here. Italy were not world-beaters. Uruguay truly are Luis Suarez plus 10 others. In Belo Horizonte on Tuesday,  England will face a Costa Rica team that would not merit a second glance from many Premier League clubs - even, in Joel Campbell’s case, the one that holds his registration, Arsenal. It was hoped this game would be the comfortable victory that confirmed English progress, after tussles with Italy and Uruguay. Instead, it is a desperate attempt at saving face. England have never lost every match at a World Cup, and a draw would merely confirm Costa Rica’s place as winners of Group D. Either outcome would be a savage denouement for Hodgson. And a win? It would be scant consolation. This, then, is the proverbial kick into nothing. ‘The last couple of days have been grim,’ Gerrard conceded. ‘It’s a tough moment. In my head, I’ve got a mixture of emotions: frustration, pain. Dejected: Too often have we seen the sight of Gerrard crouched in despair after an England match . Consoled: Gerrard (left) is hugged by Liverpool team-mate Luis Suarez (right) after the Uruguay defeat . 'The season for Liverpool ended badly for me and the team. I was coming out of that, trying to put it to bed, trying to get some positivity back through the World Cup. This is exactly what I didn’t want to happen. ‘I have to try to grieve, get away with the family and away from international football, and then make a decision on my future. 'It would be wrong for me to make that decision now. I will consider it long and hard, speak to people who will guide me. I’ve put everyone before myself. I’ve done that all the way through. This time I’ve got to make the decision that is best for me. I’ve told Roy I’ll need three weeks to clear my head. ‘It’s difficult to put into words. When you’re an England player, the captain, a fan and you’ve worked so hard to get into this position, for it to backfire over a few days, it’s a tough place to be. I’m not going to share blame or responsibility. I’ve got to take it on the chin.’ When England’s underachievement was put before Hodgson, the England manager had little in the ways of tangible answers. All alone: Hodgson's position has come under question following England's elimination in Brazil . Endemic: England's problems run far deeper than anyone imagined they did before Brazil 2014 . ‘Costa Rica were the team who were going to finish bottom of the group,’ he said. ‘Yet they’ll win it and might end up winning all three games. But if you can become a good team, maybe you can survive without necessarily having world-class players. ‘Look at their team. Their players weren’t regarded as world-class before the tournament, and maybe not after it, but they’ve had success together. Maybe there is something for us to learn from that.’ It sounded like clutching at straws, the idea a new England can be formed, minus its marquee names and elite performers. Is this really where we go from here, the acceptance that while we might fail to make an international footballer out of a truly exceptional player in Gerrard, we might succeed with an inferior model? There is no logic in that, no reason. If the path from here involves alchemy, the problems are greater than we have imagined. Deep down they all know it, too.","Gerrard has never been able to replicate his Liverpool displays for England .

"Steven Gerrard made 114 appearances for England. By his own, brutal, reckoning, there were not enough good ones. On the occasion of his hundredth cap, Gerrard put the figure at no more than six or seven great games. He winced as he said it, that pained expression so familiar to those who have followed his career as an international footballer. It was an honest emotion, openly displayed. Like him, it will be missed. The end: Steven Gerrard has retired from international football following failure at the 2014 World Cup . Stepping away: The 34-year-old has called time on his England career after 114 caps . Gerrard winced a lot with England. There has probably never been a better England captain at fronting up, but it wounded him to have to fill the role of honest broker so regularly, to defend, to justify, to rationalise. He was at it again in Brazil last month, sitting side by side with his manager Roy Hodgson, laying to rest another doomed campaign armed only with words. He must have hated that. Gerrard the man of action, reduced to parroting empty statements of hope. On Monday, he indulged the Football Association’s fantasy of a glittering England career, too. One imagines it would not be his description. One of the greatest players of his generation in Europe, his standards are set considerably higher. Gerrard was a symbol for England, but not in a way he would have hoped. He came to epitomise the shortcomings of the national team, its inexplicable failings, its one consistency: the ability to disappoint. Here was a brilliant player — one of this country’s finest, from any era — yet where was he for England? Gerrard will say he was rarely given his favoured central midfield role, but the problem runs deeper than that. It says something for the parlous state of the England team right now that a player who has so often failed to find a home in international football leaves such a big hole on the occasion of his retirement. This emptiness implies a magnificent career which Gerrard, sadly, did not have. There were echoes of Bryan Robson in his game, but not in his impact at international level. Up front: Gerrard was always brutally honest when he spoke as captain in his press conferences . VIDEO Liverpool legens salute Gerrard . In the circumstances, then, it is mystifying that yesterday’s announcement leaves such a void in England’s midfield — yet without doubt it does. Wayne Rooney will collect his captain’s armband, but there is no-one like Gerrard in the squad now, no-one with his engine, with his capacity to be the best defender, the best  tackler, the best passer, the hottest shot. These qualities were not seen often enough in tandem for England but we knew they were there and we lived in constant hope they would surface in a big game. On his day, Gerrard was the most exciting England midfield player since Paul Gascoigne; there just weren’t enough of those days. Whose fault was this? A bit of theirs, a bit of his. Sven-Goran Eriksson could have done more to make the partnership with Frank Lampard work, but Gerrard wasn’t as open-minded as he could have been with some of his other international managers. He turned in some of his most consistent performances in the qualifying campaign for the 2010 World Cup, started in a forward role on the left by Fabio Capello. He hated it, but played well and was an excellent foil for Rooney. A pity he appeared to see any position bar his favourite as a slight. Ultimately, no footballer of  modern times better encapsulates the growing disconnect between club and country than Gerrard. He was always committed to England, but in the red shirt of Liverpool he was a different class. He seemed more comfortable there, played as if free, and while he won a century of caps with England it is his performances for the club that will endure. The day he steps down at Anfield, commentators will run out of superlatives detailing his great games, yet as an individual his memorable  England displays are unlikely to number double figures. While he has won every trophy bar the title with Liverpool, his era for England, 2000 to 2014, has been marked only by underachievement. Glorious: Many Gerrard displays for Liverpool, particularly in Istanbul in 2005, have been outstanding . Irregular: There have been fewer great displays for England, with the best arguably against Andorra in 2007 . Roy of the Rovers was how Gerrard was characterised, but that disguises the uncertainty he often felt in an England shirt. Appointed assistant to Steve McClaren, Terry Venables said his greatest shock was discovering Gerrard’s private insecurity. Capello once described him as timid, and initially preferred John Terry as captain. The marauding warrior in a Liverpool shirt seemed almost crushed by a sense of duty with England. Venables thought the reason Gerrard’s partnership with Lampard so often failed to fire was that neither player was prepared to commit to attack, for fear of leaving space at the back. Far from being too cavalier, they were too diligent and sat deep, intently focused on protecting the back four and not letting the side down. What is remarkable about Gerrard’s Liverpool career is the number of times he has risen to the grandest occasion: the 2005 Champions League final, the 2006 FA Cup final, a Merseyside derby in 2012, Gerrard has saved his best for when the stakes are highest. By contrast, his finest England games have often been inconsequential: a friendly against Hungary, the 3-0 win in Andorra. He was excellent in the 5-1 win over Germany in Munich, but that was a team effort rather than an act of solo heroism. Ultimately, Gerrard was part of an England team that was less than the sum of its parts. Lowest point: Gerrard sits defeated on the Wembley turf after failure to qualify for Euro 2008 following a 3-2 defeat to Croatia . Emotion: Despite scoring his spotkick, England once again exited on penalties at Euro 2012 . Heartbreak: And in his final tournament, England went out after just two games following two defeats at the 2014 World Cup . He played in three World Cups but shared in no more than two or three acceptable England performances (against Sweden in 2006, Slovenia in 2010, and arguably the first half against Italy in 2014). He captained his country through the last three tournaments but each campaign ended in the standard inquest, with England outwitted, as always. On each occasion, Gerrard would give a frank appraisal, particularly of his own performances. Maybe that was part of the problem. He knew there was something missing, just as we did. And like us, he couldn’t explain.","England captain Steven Gerrard has retired from international football .

"Neymar once again stole the show by scoring four goals - including a perfect hat-trick- as Brazil continued their strong start under new manager Dunga by sweeping aside Japan in Singapore.

Japan started brightly, and despite resting their most established stars such as Keisuke Honda and Shinji Kagawa, the Blue Samurai caused Brazil some troubles in the first half. But Neymar was a constant threat, ably assisted by Diego Tardelli, who looked to have gained confidence from his two goals against Argentina in Beijing, and was far more involved in the build-up play than in the Superclassico. And it was from one such moment of combination that Brazil went ahead after 18 minutes.

Japan continued to make their opponents work, Kobayashi proving a handful up front and Tanaka providing energy from midfield, but they rarely forced Jefferson in the Brazil goal to make a save, as Dunga's side began to take control in Singapore. And in the second half it was the Neymar show, the 22-year-old sliding home from a brilliant Coutinho pass, tucking home a rebound after the Liverpool midfielder had seen a shot saved, and then rising highest at the back post to score a fourth. Japan had no answer to his magnificence, neither preventing the supply of ball, or, as a more experienced and perhaps more cynical side might have done, stopping him with fouls before he got into full flight. Instead . they stood off the Barcelona star, and he needed no second invitation. With the likes of Oscar, Willian and Coutinho, and later Kaka and .

"Former Wasps star Lawrence Dallaglio says the club’s move to Coventry is ‘fantastic’ and has called on fans to support it. Dallaglio, who won two European Championships and five Premiership titles with Wasps, says the move had to happen for Wasps to stay competitive, and that true fans will follow their team to the midlands. The former No 8 says he understands the controversy behind the move, but thinks that it is needed for the club to stay in the top flight.

"Google and other internet giants came under fierce attack from David Cameron yesterday for ‘effectively denying responsibility’ for vile online images. The Prime Minister, unveiling measures to try to limit the impact of online porn, said watching hardcore material was ‘in danger of becoming a rite of passage’ for Britain’s youngsters. ‘Our children are growing up too fast,’ he said, confirming plans revealed in yesterday’s Mail for all 19million households connected to the internet to be forced to say whether or not they want to continue having access to legal adult material. Blacklist: David Cameron warned search engines like Google and Yahoo they have a 'moral duty' to act against banned search terms . On illegal child porn, Mr Cameron said the way internet search engines behaved was the equivalent of the Post Office ‘helping someone identify and order illegal material... and then sending it on to them’. In such circumstances ‘they would absolutely be held responsible for their actions’. Demanding that search engines ‘step up to the plate’, the Prime Minister said: ‘We need a situation where you cannot have people searching for child abuse images and being aided in doing so.’ Mr Cameron said web firms should block all searches that include words on a blacklist being drawn up by watchdogs and ensure warning signs flash up telling internet users that material they are trying to access is against the law. He threatened legislation unless there is significant progress by October. ‘If people enter into a Google search a truly disgusting term, something that’s so obvious that the searcher is looking for illegal child abuse images, my view – and I think the view of parents up and down the country – is that the internet company shouldn’t return any results,’ he said. ‘At the moment they’re saying they should. They’re saying it’s a matter of free speech. I’m saying look, it isn’t about free speech, these images are illegal, you shouldn’t enable people who are deliberately searching for them.’ In a speech at the NSPCC in London, Mr Cameron said family-friendly filters would be automatically selected by providers for all new broadband customers by the end of the year – although they will be able to choose to switch them off. Millions of existing computer users will be contacted by the end of next year and told they must decide whether or not to use ‘family-friendly filters’ to restrict adult material. The filters will apply to all devices linked to a home wi-fi network. Victory for the Mail: Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured today, today announced new rules requiring every internet connection to have porn blocked unless subscribers 'opt in' to obscene content . Customers who do not click on either option – accepting or declining – will have filters activated by default. Asked if the opt-in system would mean a husband having to confess to his partner if he wanted to look at porn, Mr Cameron told Radio 5 Live: ‘If an adult wants to get rid of the filter on their computer, that’s up to them.’ Pressed on the issue, the Prime Minister eventually conceded: ‘Yes, it does.’ He said he would be installing internet filters in his own home, adding: ‘You’re always a few clicks away from something you shouldn’t see.’ A Google spokesman said: ‘We have a zero tolerance attitude to child sexual abuse imagery. We use our own systems and work with child safety experts to find it, remove and report it. 'We recently donated $5m (£3.3m) to groups working to combat this problem and are committed to continuing the dialogue with the Government on these issues.’ Dido Harding, chief executive of TalkTalk, said: ‘We take our responsibility very seriously and that is why we are now contacting our existing customers to ask them if they want to use [family-friendly filter] HomeSafe, and we will be pre-ticking HomeSafe as on for new customers from the end of the year. ‘One in three customers are choosing to turn on parental controls when offered the chance.’ But Padraig Reidy of the Index on Censorship warned: ‘Sites about sexual health, about sexuality and so on, will get caught up in the same filters as pornography. It will really restrict people’s experience on the web, including children’s.’ BY ANDREW LEVY, EDUCATION REPORTER . Geoffrey Bettley: Child porn photos . Teachers caught with images of child abuse will be banned automatically from classrooms, the Department for Education says. Previously, some school staff found to have child porn were allowed to continue working. The new guidance says ‘any criminal conviction or caution that involves indecent images of children’ should lead to an indefinite ban. Any sexual misconduct, not just ‘serious sexual misconduct’, should trigger a ban, it says. This would include behaviour that is not illegal but does bring the teacher’s conduct into question. The new rules follow the revelation last month that religious education teacher Geoffrey Bettley was given the go-ahead to pursue his career despite being found to have downloaded almost 200 photos of child porn. Bettley, 36, was suspended from from St Mary’s Catholic School in Menston, West Yorkshire, in December 2010 after his arrest. He accepted a police caution and was dismissed by the school. But a professional conduct panel said he should be allowed to apply for work in other schools as he ‘does not represent a risk to children’. Paedophile Thomas Owen, 33, from Wallasey, Merseyside, who amassed the largest collection of child porn images ever seized in Britain – more than 3.5million – was jailed for seven years yesterday at Liverpool  Crown Court.","David Cameron said family-friendly filters would be automatically selected for new broadband customers by the end of the year .

"Brazil forward Neymar has paid tribute to his club team-mate Lionel Messi, claiming the Argentinian star is 'the best in the world', ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo.

But Neymar, who will face the diminutive forward in Saturday's Superclassico de la Americas in China, insists his Barcelona team-mate is still number one.

We have to hope he does not have a good day and doesn't get the opportunity to touch the ball,' he joked. 'Seriously, we have to be careful because you have to be always alert when facing a great player like him, we cannot give him time and space to think or dribble.

"Click here for your ultimate stats guide to the game, including Neymar's heatmap . More than any other teams in world football, Brazil and Argentina have come to be defined, in recent years, by their No 10s. In Barcelona duo Lionel Messi and Neymar, the South American giants have arguably the best two players in the world in that position, and both teams are built around their respective superstars. But how did the pair compare when they met in Beijing on Saturday? Barcelona striker Neymar, celebrating with goal scorer Diego Tardelli,  was in fine form against Argentina . INFLUENCE . It might not be right to describe Brazil vs Argentina as simply Neymar vs Messi - but both teams rely so heavily on their star man that if either goes missing, the whole side can lose their way. Brazil, as the World Cup showed, are only as good as their No 10, while Messi, on his day, can carry Argentina almost single-handedly. It's not enough to be good, these two have to dominate the whole game to earn praise. In the first half hour, there is no doubt who was winning this battle. Messi was involved in everything good that Argentina did, getting on the ball in deep areas, committing defenders and feeding his team-mates. Not only did he beat defenders himself, but his very presence drew men away from his fellow forwards. Angel di Maria and Sergio Aguero had more space than they would normally be afforded by virtue of playing alongside Messi. Here is Lionel Messi's heatmap from the friendly showing a strong attacking presence for Argentina . Brazil forward Neymar challenges for a set piece during his impressive performance for his national side . Neymar, heatmap above, was key to Brazil's forward play, particularly on the left and down the centre . Neymar, meanwhile, was left isolated for much of the first half, lurking on the lonely left wing while Brazil struggled to get a foothold. It was clear, whenever Dunga's side won the ball, that they were looking to their talisman for a lift, but possession was so rare (less than 35 per cent in the first half) that he was a peripheral figure. In fact, Brazil's No 10 made just 10 passes in the entire first 45 minutes, less than a third of Messi's tally - and three of those 10 failed to find a team-mate. But, after Diego Tardelli's opener, the 22-year-old came to life. Dazzling dribbles, incisive passes, and very nearly a superb solo goal. Suddenly Neymar, without having too much of the ball, was the most exciting player on the pitch. Every time he got the ball he looked to have the beating of a desperately slow Argentina defence. His pace and threat brought fouls and cards, and by the end of the game there was little doubt who the most threatening player on the pitch was. MESSI: 5/10 NEYMAR 9/10 . Lionel Messi looks dejected after missing a chance for Argentina during the 2-0 defeat to Brazil in China . CREATIVITY . Both players are absolutely vital to their side's chance creation. Despite Chelsea duo Oscar and Willian alongside him, Neymar is the only genuine creative focal point in the Brazil side. Argentina have a few more options, with Angel di Maria in particular diverting some of the pressure off Messi's shoulders, but the diminutive genuis is still the key man. Neither of the two were particularly wonderful in a first half which lacked many clear-cut chances, but Messi offered slightly more, creating two chances for Sergio Aguero. First he slid Pablo Zabaleta in behind before the full back's cross was mishit by Aguero, then he put the Manchester City striker in down the right hand channel, only for the forward to blaze over the bar. Neymar, on the other hand, created only for himself in the opening 45, although this was enough to strike fear into the Argentinian defence. He rectified that soon after half time, a perfectly weighted pass playing in Felipe Luis, who should really have made it 2-0, and then releasing Willian inside the box, who again was wasteful. MESSI: 6/10 NEYMAR 6/10 . David Luiz and Brazil's defence managed to keep Messi relatively quiet for a clean sheet on Saturday . INDIVIDUAL BRILLIANCE . While Brazil's new counter-attacking system relies on Neymar to do it all himself, Argentina's tactical set-up lets Messi drift in and out, before attacking from deeper areas. Both systems are designed to get the best out of their major star, and both seemed to work fairly well in that respect. Messi repeatedly picked up the ball from the right hand side and drove at the Brazilian defence, who usually responded by fouling him. Mostly the Argentine beat at least one man, before spreading the play wide or winning a free kick in a dangerous area. The levels of excitement were certainly raised around the stadium when he got on the ball, but there were hints, rather than devastating examples, of what he can do on the ball. Brazil's talisman Neymar was on the receiving end of several heavy tackles from the Argentina back line . As the need to take the game by the scruff of the neck increased with Brazil's two goals, Messi came further inside and began to run with the ball more. Two shots soon after the hour mark tested Jefferson, though neither really threatened to find the back of the net. Neymar, on the other hand, clearly had the upper hand in this particular duel. Out of the game for such long periods, the Brazil captain showed several times what he could do when given time and space. Soon after the half hour Neymar went on three devastating dribbles in five short minutes, slicing through the Argentina defence with ease and very nearly taking the game away from his opponents single-handedly. MESSI: 6/10 NEYMAR 9/10 . Javier Mascherano fails to halt another marauding run by Neymar, who showed plenty of creativity in China . END PRODUCT . For all their tricks and flicks, runs and rabonas, the pair will always be judged on their final touch. In the first half, both were found seriously wanting. Messi, usually so deadly, fired two free kicks against the wall and failed to manufacture any shooting opportunities from open play. Even when presented with the perfect opportunity from 12 yards the former World Player of the Year could only fire his spot-kick tamely at Jefferson. The second half saw three decent efforts from the edge of the box, all of which brought saves from Jefferson, but only an 80th minute free-kick looked close to beating the Brazil keeper. Neymar was little better. His best run, during which he ran from half-way, beating two men before drawing the keeper, ended with something of a whimper, a scuffed shot that trickled wide. Then, early in the second half, the pacey Brazilian eased past the defence only to cut the ball back to no-one. Even when put through one-on-one by Luis Gustavo against a goalkeeper stuck in no-mans-land, the young forward could only chip over the bar. MESSI: 5/10 NEYMAR 5/10 . Messi was surprisingly out of sorts for his national side, having a penalty saved as Brazil won 2-0 in Beijing . Neymar runs away to celebrate Brazil's second goal as the Barcelona striker put in an influential display . DEFENSIVE WORK . Neither of these players is particularly noted for their work without the ball, but football is a team game, and no side can afford to carry a man, however talented, completely. Messi has, this season, returned to his pressing game at Barcelona, and appeared keen to keep it up on Saturday. No longer did we see the Argentine standing still or wandering around after losing the ball - Messi worked hard to win it back, and pressure defenders into mistakes. In truth, the success of this was limited, but it was important for Tata Martino's gameplan that his talisman made an effort when out of possession. Neymar, on the other hand, was required to do almost nothing defensively, lurking up-field while his team-mates won the ball back. This left Pablo Zabaleta free to attack down the right unchecked, and could have been costly if Argentina's forwards had been on their game. MESSI: 5/10 NEYMAR 4/10 . The Brazil squad celebrate together after Diego Tardelli doubled his total during the 2-0 win in Beijing . TOTAL . Messi started the brighter, but after Brazil took the lead and space opened up for Neymar it was the younger man that stole the show. Messi was the focal point for an Argentina side that, for all their possession, created few clear-cut chances, while Neymar typified the counter-attacking spirit that Dunga is trying to instill. Neither man was quite at their brilliant best, but Neymar upstaged his more experienced club-mate. MESSI: 27/50 NEYMAR 33/50 .

"The secret behind Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci's wonder-strike against Roma on Sunday has been revealed - as the Italian was given 'garlic sweets' before the game. Alberto Ferrarini, Bonucci's motivational coach, said he gave the 27-year-old sweets on Saturday night, to help him 'return to his origins'. And, in a bizarre twist, Ferrarini told him to breathe on the Roma strikers to put the Roma forwards off their game. Leonardo Bonucci smashes home a volley from the edge of the box to give Juventus a vital three points . Bonucci's goal extended Juve's 100 per cent start to the season and lifted them above Roma in Serie A . 'On Saturday night we spent three hours in the hotel to prepare for the game,' Ferrarini told Italian paper Tuttosport. 'Any new secrets? When we finished our work I gave Leonardo some garlic sweets. Natural products, inedible. 'The soldiers of hundreds of years ago ate garlic to remain strong, healthy and lucid in battle. Leo is a soldier, and eating the sweets is as if he is returning to those origins. Juventus' motivational coach Alberto Ferrarini says he gave Bonucci garlic sweets before the game . 'I told him to breathe in the face of Gervinho and Totti… The most important thing was to achieve the objective, to win.'

'I do not want to hear him talk about the most important goal if his career as he did after the game. 'He has to stay focused, the most important goal will be the best one and that will always be so.

"A mother is claiming she was duped under false pretenses into giving up her child for adoption to the son of the former mayor of Oklahoma City and now wants her baby back. Heather Bazzle says she gave up her son, Max, to Lance Norick and his wife Darcy in September, but before the adoption was finalized she discovered the couple were getting a divorce. The couple have since split to live in Arizona and Oklahoma while Max is now living with former mayor Ron Norick - a situation which Bazzle calls a 'failed adoption'. Scroll Down for Video . Teary: Heather Bazzle wants her son Max back from Lance and Darcy Norick because they divorced and did not tell her their marriage was in trouble during the adoption process . Bazzle, who is already the mother of three, decided to give up her unborn son because she could not financially support him. She told KFOR.com that she remembers thinking, 'How am I going to give this child everything I can?' A meeting with an adoption attorney led to the recommendation of Lance and Darcy Norck, who then both lived in Arizona. Bazzle said, 'They seemed like the perfect couple', and they were both present for Max's birth. Custody battle: Lance and Darcy Norick (left) do not currently have custody of Max (right) despite taking him from Heather Bazzle in September . First Christmas: The Noricks with Max before they separated and moved apart to Arizona and Oklahoma City . However, before the final paperwork went through, Bazzle discovered they were to split and she filed her emergency custody application because she believes the couple misrepresented themselves. 'That’s my baby. I love him,' Bazzle said. 'I’m trying to do what’s best for him, and even though I may have made a mistake placing him for adoption, I feel like God’s giving me a chance now to fix that and to be there for him.' However, an adoption expert in Oklahoma City told KFOR.com that the process Bazzle would have gone through would have been very specific. Determined mother: Heather Bazzle already has three children - and felt she couldn't financially support a third so gave Max up for adoption . Happy: The Norick's were there at Max's birth and took him home to Arizona afterwards . 'The judge asks, 'you understand that forever is a long time?' said Jim Ikard, . 'The mothers say, 'Yes, I do.' He added that it would be up to Bazzle to prove fraud had taken place - which he said would be very difficult. In addition, the fact that they had legally declared their custody originally to not be in the 'best interests' of the child would hinder any future claims. 'And so the question gets to be, if you don’t like this couple, it’s not a matter of you getting the child back. It’s finding another couple,' Ikard said. Bazzle said, 'I don’t feel like I can give my son to anybody and trust anybody with him anymore.'

The 19-year-old later received a lift home from Liverpool and England team-mate Jordan Henderson after the session.

Roy Hodgson left Sterling out of the starting line-up for England's 1-0 win over Estonia in Euro 2016 qualifying on Sunday after the young playmaker complained of feeling tired. Sterling has become a key player for club and country this season and his increased time on the field appears to be taking its toll on the Liverpool star. Hodgson is expected to hold talks with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers this week regarding their shared use of Sterling - and he could be left out of the trip to QPR on Sunday if deemed too tired again. Sterling views criticism of him for complaining of tiredness as unfair after a difficult start to the new campaign - and appeared to speak out on Twitter against his detractors. After coming off the bench in Tallinn, Sterling was fouled for the free-kick that led to Wayne Rooney's second-half winner that secured a perfect start to England's qualifying group with three wins from three games.

"Jimmy Case believes Liverpool would have been Premier League champions last season had Jamie Carragher not retired. Brendan Rodgers' side finished just two points adrift of champions Manchester City after slipping up towards the end of the season.

Case adds that the presence of Carragher, who retired at the end of the 2012-2013 season, would have prevented them squandering a three-goal to draw 3-3 at Crystal Palace. The former Liverpool midfielder told theDaily Mirror: 'If Carragher had stayed on for one more season, Liverpool would have won it.

"Neil Lennon has been appointed as the new manager of Bolton Wanderers. Lennon had been poised to speak to Al-Ittihad in Saudi Arabia earlier this week but met Bolton owner Eddie Davies on Saturday before securing a deal with the Championship strugglers.

'Following a process of first and second interviews with a shortlist of initial candidates, a unanimous decision was taken by Eddie Davies, Brett Warburton and Phil Gartside. 'The club are delighted and excited to appoint Neil Lennon. He brings with him experience at the highest level and an infectious enthusiasm to take the club forward. 'He will officially take charge of the Bolton Wanderers team from Monday morning in the run up to our upcoming game away at Birmingham City.' Former Celtic boss Lennon lifts the Scottish Premiership league trophy in May before later leaving the club . Currently propping up the English second tier after winning just one league game this season, Bolton have been looking for a new manager since parting company with Scot Dougie Freedman earlier this month. Lennon has been away from football’s front-line since leaving Celtic in May after a successful four-year spell. He was due to travel to Saudi Arabia this week for talks on the vacant Al-Ittihad post but visa problems meant he and his backroom staff were unable to travel to Jeddah. Whilst a remuneration package of over £2million per year was attractive, Lennon had reservations at moving to the Middle East in any event in terms of his career development. The challenge of firstly securing the Trotters’ place in the Championship before building for promotion is far more appealing and he will take the team for the first time at Birmingham next week.

"To some observers, it always seemed rather odd that Abu Hamza al-Masri spent eight years and more than £150,000 of British taxpayers’ money fighting extradition to America. After all, the militant Islamist preacher had been in a British prison — principally at Belmarsh in South London and, later, Long Lartin in Worcestershire — since May 2004. Did it really make that much difference, swapping a jail cell in one hated infidel country for a jail cell in another? But the former Soho nightclub bouncer — convicted in Britain of ‘soliciting to murder’ and inciting racial hatred — has always feared the Americans getting their hands on him. Scroll down for video . Hook: Abu Hamza, the former Soho nightclub bouncer - convicted in Britain of 'soliciting to murder' and inciting racial hatred - has always feared the Americans getting their hands on him . And today, as he languishes in near-solitary confinement in the grim Metropolitan Correctional Centre in Manhattan, he can stare at his 7½ft x 8ft cell’s stained breeze-block walls and reflect that he was right to be afraid. For years, the Egyptian-born preacher abused the hospitality of the country that gave him a home — quite literally, housing his large family in a smart West London street, and supporting them with state benefits — by attacking its values and calling for its violent overthrow. But while the British Government is deeply relieved to rid itself of him after years of embarrassment and exasperation, U.S. officials haven’t been able to hide their delight at finally getting their hands on him. After the September 11 attacks destroyed the Twin Towers, Hamza crowed: ‘Many people will be happy, jumping up and down at this moment.’ Today, that’s a fair description of the American government’s feelings on having him in its power. Eleven years after Hamza’s hate-filled sermons inspired 9/11 plotter Zacarias Moussaoui (and months later did the same for Londoner Richard Reid, who tried to bring down a Miami-bound American Airlines flight with a shoe bomb), he has arrived in a country that loathes him as much as he loathes it. The New York Post summed up the prevailing mood: ‘Now he’s all ours,’ it said. Hamza and the other three suspects extradited with him were ‘at the nerve centres of Al Qaeda’s terror networks and will finally face justice’, according to Preet Bharara, the U.S. district attorney who will lead the prosecution. Peter King, a local U.S. congressman and chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, described Abu Hamza as ‘obviously an arrogant b*****d’ and an ‘evil person’. In the U.S., 54-year-old Hamza faces 11 terrorism charges relating to three plots, among them the 1998 kidnapping in Yemen of 16 tourists, including two Americans, in which three Britons and an Australian died. In cell: The Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, New York, where Abu Hamza al-Masri is being held . He is also accused of supporting the setting up of a terrorist training camp in Oregon, and fomenting violent jihad in Afghanistan. He has pleaded not guilty, but faces a life sentence — and, in America, life is likely to mean life — if convicted. Already, he has experienced the brutally no-nonsense approach of U.S. law-enforcement: on arrival, his famous hooks were confiscated as a security risk, and last Saturday he was forced to make a court appearance with the stumps of his arms protruding from the short sleeves of his navy blue jumpsuit. (Hamza says he lost both hands and an eye in a landmine explosion during the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan.) But this is just the start: he can expect no quarter from U.S. authorities determined to make his life as uncomfortable as possible. At one stage, prison guards at the Manhattan jail — where breakfast is powdered egg, tinned tomatoes and toast — boasted that he was having to eat through a straw as none of them were willing to feed him. Contrast this with the softly-softly approach of human rights-obsessed Britain, where prison officials paid £650 to fit special hook-friendly taps in his Belmarsh cell. For now, his American lawyers have won him the right to wear his hooks for short periods each day so he can feed and wash himself. And the U.S. government has agreed to pay around $16,000 for a set of rubber prosthetic hands — though only the basic model, officials stress. While British taxpayers paid millions for his detention costs, a U.S. Bureau of Prisons spokesman stressed that official policy states all inmates’ health services ‘will be obtained at the lowest possible cost’. Helping out: Defence lawyer Jeremy Schneider exits a court in Manhattan, New York, following the arraignment of his client, accused terrorist Abu Hamza, on Tuesday . Hamza has, at least, managed to wrangle a new pair of anti-slip trainers after his lawyer pleaded that, without his hooks to break his fall, he could injure himself if he trips over. Such are the concerns these days of the infamous preacher of hate. While he waits to go on trial — which could take anywhere from nine months to two years — Hamza will remain in the bleak New York jail that has housed fraudster Bernie Madoff and Mafia boss John Gotti. The 14-storey concrete building has held previous terror suspects in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, and 24 hours at weekends. Hamza’s hour of exercise in a caged area on the roof is likely to be equally lonely, say ex-wardens. Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, known as the Merchant of Death, has spent 14 months there in solitary confinement. His lawyers claimed conditions were ‘barbaric’, comparing it with the imprisonment of the fictional Count of Monte Cristo and complaining that Bout had been denied ‘basic, God-given rights, like fresh air and sun’. Unfortunately for Bout, it looks as if he will be transferred to somewhere his lawyers described as ‘even worse’ — the ‘Supermax’ ADX Florence facility in Colorado. Supermax, nicknamed the Alcatraz of the Rockies, is America’s toughest prison for its roughest prisoners. After the U.S. gave assurances that Hamza would not be sent to the military base at Guantanamo Bay, the Supermax is almost certain to be his destination if convicted. Almost all America’s most notorious terrorists, domestic or foreign, are held here, with the country’s most vicious gang leaders and drug lords. Anger: Peter King, a local U.S. congressman and chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, described Abu Hamza as 'obviously an arrogant b*****d' and an 'evil person' Hamza had long fought extradition at the European Court of Human Rights by claiming that conditions at Supermax amount to torture, but this was rejected by the court. Suffice to say that Supermax, described by a former warden as a ‘clean version of Hell’, is a far cry from HMP Belmarsh. At the latter, which houses some of Britain’s most dangerous men, staff and prisoners are increasingly intimidated by Muslim inmates, who account for one in five of the prison population. Islamic extremists — who sit at the top of the prison pecking order and are widely feared — are reportedly recruiting new followers unmolested in Belmarsh’s prison yard. In such an environment, according to the counter-extremism think-tank the Quilliam Foundation, Hamza — who resided in a maximum-security cell, but not solitary confinement — was able to communicate with fellow prisoners and even deliver sermons, without attracting the attention of warders, by banging on the pipes. There are no pipes with which to talk to any of the other 250 inmates at the Supermax. And though there are plenty of other Islamic extremists, including some he inspired, Hamza wouldn’t be fraternising with them. Prisoners live in virtual isolation, confined 23 hours a day under tight lockdown conditions in tiny cells. In  each, there is only a concrete bed and thin mattress, an immovable concrete desk and stool, a combined lavatory, sink and drinking fountain, and — if he is lucky — a small black and white TV showing educational and religious programmes. Other inmates: While he waits to go on trial - which could take from nine months to two years - Hamza will remain in the bleak jail that has housed fraudster Bernie Madoff (left) and Mafia boss John Gotti (right) A 4in wide window, little more than an arrow slit, looks out on to an inner courtyard, but only shows the roof and sky to prevent prisoners working out their location for an escape. Inmates exercise in a concrete pit resembling an empty swimming pool, also designed to stop them working out where they are in the building. Communication with the outside world is severely limited under restrictions known as SAMs, or Special Administration Measures. A prisoner such as Hamza would be able to communicate with only a handful of other inmates, while personal phone calls would be restricted to select family members and are always monitored. Lawyers warn that Hamza’s family — his wife is still living in a £1 million council house in London — may not be allowed into the U.S. to see him. Previous inmates have nothing good to say about the Supermax. In letters to a local newspaper, convicted bomber Eric Rudolph complained that the regime is intended to ‘inflict pain and misery’. Conditions — particularly the isolation and sensory deprivation — have prompted six suicides and hundreds of hunger-strike protests, most recently by shoebomber Richard Reid. And in June, a lawsuit on behalf of mentally ill prisoners there claimed some were so disturbed they were swallowing razor blades, smearing faeces around their cells  and banging their heads against walls for hours on end. Other Supermax residents include 9/11 architect Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called Unabomber Ted Kaczynski — who murdered three people and injured many others — and five Al Qaeda terrorists convicted of the 1988 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. Alun Jones QC, the lawyer who represented Hamza in his tortuous extradition proceedings, has been trying to elicit sympathy for his client, whom he says has diabetes, psoriasis and high blood pressure. Chiding Britain for not trying Hamza itself on some of the charges he faces in the U.S., he has trotted out the standard line of lawyers defending notorious clients that ‘a test of a civilised society is how it treats people it despises’. In which case, as Hamza is about to discover, America is considerably less civilised than Britain.","Spent eight years & £150,000 of British taxpayers' money fighting extradition .

"Marin Cilic hailed the impact of coach Goran Ivanisevic after winning his first Grand Slam title at the US Open. Cilic became the first Croatian to win a major title since Ivanisevic's famous triumph at Wimbledon 2001 with a stunning 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 win over Kei Nishikori in New York on Monday.

Sealed with a kiss: Marin Cilic celebrates winning the US Open after his straight sets win over Kei Nishikori . Cilic said: 'He brought just, in the team, a very relaxed atmosphere, besides extremely huge knowledge. 'At the beginning when we started to work, we sat together and Goran told me that my game and my tennis has to be aggressive tennis. 'I can't play too much tactically, because most of the times before I was dealing too much with the tactics against players and not focusing on my game. 'It wasn't easy to change my perspective and to change completely my mindset. It took even five, six months of the tournaments to be able to sink that into me and that I know on the court that's the right way for me to play. Celebration time: Goran Ivanisevic celebrates as Cilic wins the US Open . 'Definitely my serve has improved enormously, and then everything else has followed.' Cilic, 25, will now move up to No 9 in the world rankings after claiming a title which seemed unthinkable prior to the tournament, even for the man himself. He said: 'It seems completely unreal to be called Grand Slam champion. I was dreaming about this all my life, and suddenly the last four, five days everything started to change, and with my tennis especially. Overcome with emotion: Cilic falls to the floor after winning the US Open final in straight sets . 'It means everything. It's just a huge accomplishment and huge moment for myself and for my team and for everybody around me who was with me all these years supporting me, believing in me and never giving up. This is just the peak of the world.' Despite a disappointing end to the tournament, Nishikori's run to the final was impressive considering that he missed both the Toronto and Cincinnati Masters last month after having a cyst removed from his right foot. He's done it: Cilic punches the air after winning his first grand slam title at Flushing Meadows . The Japanese 24-year-old - who will move to a career-high No 8 in the rankings - will take the positives from his fortnight at Flushing Meadows, which included two stunning consecutive victories against Stan Wawrinka and world No 1 Novak Djokovic. Nishikori said: 'It was one of the worst matches I played today, but also he was very aggressive and very fast. I was, I have to say, a little bit nervous. 'I didn't expect anything coming here. Before I was injured and [had] little practice. Following in the footsteps: Cilic became the first Croatian since Ivanisevic to win a grand slam . 'There is so many positive things for sure that I can have from these two weeks beating Stan and Novak again. 'I think I showed I can beat anybody now. So if I can keep training hard and also practice hard, I think I have more chances coming up.'","Marin Cilic beat Kei Nishikori 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 in the US Open final .

"British doubles specialist Ross Hutchins became a Grand Slam semi-finalist for the first time as he and partner Yung-Jan Chan progressed to the last four of the mixed doubles at the US Open on Monday. Hutchins and Chan, of Chinese Taipei, were leading Marcin Matkowski and Kveta Peschke 6-4, 1-2 when Peschke retired as she struggled on a hot and humid evening in New York. The pair now face a tough semi-final against top seeds Sania Mirza and Bruno Soares, who knocked out Jamie Murray and Casey Dellacqua in the second round. Teamwork: Ross Hutchins and Yung-Jan Chan reached the semi-finals of the US Open mixed doubles . Hutchins said: 'It's exciting. I'm really pleased actually to win a few matches. 'She [Chan] was playing great. I enjoy playing with her. We were very relaxed on court.' It is an impressive run for the first-time pairing, who decided to team up after an initial meeting in the gym at Wimbledon two months ago. Hutchins said: 'She came up to me at Wimbledon while I was in the gym and just said ""Hey, I'm Letitia [her English name]. What's your ranking?"" Talking tactics: Hutchins is finding his form again . 'She seemed really nice. We got on really well. The first time we ever hit together was probably about half an hour before the first match.' The mixed doubles has provided a welcome run of results for 29-year-old Hutchins, who has struggled to rediscover his form after returning to the tour in January following his successful battle against cancer in 2013. Hutchins and Colin Fleming's first-round exit in the men's doubles at Flushing Meadows was their third in a row at this year's Grand Slams. The US Open was the last event in which Hutchins could use his protected ranking of No 29, meaning that he will now have to start using his current ranking of No 148 for tournament entry. With his ranking too low to enter ATP tour events, Hutchins admits that he and Fleming will now have to temporarily part ways. Hutchins said: 'Together we're not going to be playing the next month or so because we are not going to get in. 'Colin's going to play a couple of tournaments with someone else. For me, I need to get my ranking back up which is going to be from playing Challengers and different events.'","Ross Hutchins and Yung-Jan Chan are into the last four .

"John McEnroe has said it is time for Andy Murray to 'step up' at the US Open after the Brit's struggles on tour this year. Murray is seeded No 8 at Flushing Meadows - his lowest Grand Slam seeding for more than six years - after failing to win a title since his Wimbledon triumph in July 2013. The 27-year-old has found it difficult to rediscover his best form consistently since undergoing back surgery last September and was hit hard by his split with coach Ivan Lendl in March. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Murray needs to step up - McEnroe . Tough going: Andy Murray has struggled to rediscover his best form since undergoing back surgery . McEnroe, who will compete in December's Statoil Masters Tennis event at London's Royal Albert Hall, said: 'It’s difficult to say what’s happening with Andy. 'It seems like the physical issues are behind him - it’s impossible to say for sure from the outside but that’s how it looks. 'It’s been a process for him to come back from those issues so that takes its toll on the confidence, and he made a big change - I thought he and Ivan worked well together.' 'To change course when he did is tricky so it remains to be seen what happens there. You need to give it more time to judge, but you sort of feel like the US Open would be a time he needs to step up because it’s been a struggle compared to what it’s been the last couple of years.' VIDEO Murray needs to step up - McEnroe . Return: John McEnroe will return to the Royal Albert Hall in December for the Statoil Tennis Masters . Murray, who won his first Grand Slam at the 2012 US Open, will reunite with new coach Amelie Mauresmo in New York after the Frenchwoman took a break while her charge competed in last week's Cincinnati Masters. This is only the second Grand Slam that Mauresmo has prepared Murray for - and McEnroe feels that time will tell whether the partnership will be a success or not. McEnroe said: 'Amelie Mauresmo’s appointment was a little out of left-field and an unusual choice, but she’s had some coaching experience and she’s been out there herself so she can bring things to the table. 'You always need to give these things some time to see how they relate to each other and whether she can make that little difference. 'Can she help him find that extra two to five percent? That’s the key. It remains to be seen.' Teamwork: Murray (left) has been working with new coach Amelie Mauresmo since June . Former mentor: Murray (left) split with former coach Ivan Lendl in March after a 14-month partnership . Roger Federer sent out a timely warning ahead of the US Open as the 33-year-old won his first Masters title for two years in Cincinnati on Sunday. But while 17-time Grand Slam champion Federer has looked like his old self on court recently, his Wimbledon conqueror Novak Djokovic has slumped to last-16 defeats in both Cincinnati and Toronto. McEnroe, however, feels that world No 1 Djokovic is still the favourite to lift the US Open trophy this summer. The American said: 'Roger looks great - he’s looked the best of all the top guys this summer. On form: Roger Federer poses with the winner's trophy after he won the Cincinnati Masters on Sunday . Struggle: Novak Djokovic suffered consecutive last-16 exits in Cincinnati and Toronto . 'I think Novak had an incredible run at Wimbledon and it seems to me he is waiting for the Open. 'I don’t think it matters a whole lot what’s happened with his results in the summer. To me, he’s still the favourite going in. 'There’s a cast of other characters that will want to break through and finally put their names in the record books, and the most obvious ones are (Grigor) Dimitrov and (Milos) Raonic, but Djokovic is still the favourite.'

"Jose Mourinho insisted he would never interfere in medical decisions after Thibaut Courtois suffered a head injury in Chelsea's 2-0 win over Arsenal at Stamford Bridge. The Belgium goalkeeper initially played on following his collision with Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez before being replaced by Petr Cech and leaving the stadium for precautionary tests at a hospital. The decision left the Premier League regulations on head injuries facing further scrutiny amid concerns that clubs have too much say in whether a player can continue or not. Thibaut Courtois suffered a blow when he came out to challenge Alexis Sanchez but played on afterwards . Sanchez immediately shows concern for Courtois as the Chelsea goalkeeper appeared badly hurt on the pitch . Jose Mourinho insists he would never interfere in medical decisions after Courtois's head injury on Sunday . 'Doctor Biosca (Chelsea's medical director Paco Biosca) says there's nothing to be too much worried about,' said Mourinho, after confirming Courtois had gone for tests. 'On the bench I don't communicate with the doctors. I just get decisions. ""Can he stay (on)?"" ""Yes""; ""He has to leave"". ""Okay"". I have no time and no medical qualities to discuss that. 'I was just worried for the kid (Courtois), not worried about the game and the performance. 'We have two of the best three goalkeepers in the world, so when one of them is injured and comes out and the other one comes in, no problem, no change in my heart beat. The Chelsea goalkeeper continued for 13 minutes after the injury before being forced from the pitch . The Belgian is escorted up the tunnel and was immediately treated by paramedics in the dressing room . '(I was) so confident that Petr could do once more a fantastic job for us.' Cech began the season as second choice after a decade in the first XI and made his 480th appearance for Chelsea, just his second as a substitute. The 32-year-old plays wearing a rugby scrum cap after fracturing his skull against Reading in October 2006 in an incident which heightened medical procedures at football stadia. Mourinho, who was unhappy with Cech's treatment eight years ago, believes Chelsea acted properly in relation to Courtois. 'I always tell them (Chelsea's medical team) when I'm on the bench I don't want to communicate with them,' Mourinho said. 'I just want them to give me a decision and they gave me a decision. For me that's correct. 'The club doctor, or the club medical department to take control and the responsibility.'

"Gregory Arthur Weiler II, 23, is accused of plotting to bomb up 48 Oklahoma churches . A bright green duffel bag caught maintenance worker Ralph Smith's eye as he emptied trash into a bin at motel just off a major interstate in northeast Oklahoma. Curious, he unzipped it, and found a pile of brown bottles with cloth wicks attached by duct tape. His observant reactions might have foiled a plot to blow up 48 churches across Oklahoma. Smith next noticed an empty gas can in the bin, and a co-worker remembered seeing a motel guest with it two days earlier. They quickly reported their finds to police, leading to the arrest of a 23-year-old Illinois man who authorities now say planned to attack dozens of churches with Molotov cocktails. Gregory Arthur Weiler II, 23, of Elk Grove Village, Ill., has been charged with threatening to use an explosive or incendiary device and violating the Oklahoma Antiterrorism Act. 'I don't feel like I'm a hero or anything like that,' said. 'We were doing it because we want the public to know people can stay here and this is not a bad place.' Maintenance worker Steve Ballenger said he saw Weiler with the gas can two days earlier - and Weiler explained that he had run out of gas in his car. After Smith discovered the gas can and bag in the trash bin on Thursday October 4, the two pretended to be cleaning and went into Weiler's room. There, they found more duct tape, nylon and other items. Motel owner Ishver Patel said he considers it 'lucky' that Weiler was caught. 'He might have blown up here and innocent people get hurt,' Patel said. Police said in an affidavit that along with bomb-making materials, they found pieces of paper in Weiler's room that when assembled, contained directions for making Molotov cocktails, a list of 48 local churches and an outline of a plan to plant bombs at the churches. Weiler, who is being held without bail, has applied for a court-appointed attorney. His cousin, Johnny Meyers, has said that Weiler has struggled with mental illness but is fine when he takes his medication. Ralph Smith, a maintenance worker at the Legacy Inn & Suites, stands in front of the trash bin where he found discarded bomb-making materials . Meyers said relatives believe Weiler may have stopped taking his medication before his arrest. Ministers and others at churches in Miami said they were surprised by the arrest and didn't know why he focused on their town. 'The only thing I can think of is this is the Bible belt,' said Carrol Thompson, the secretary at Immanuel Baptist Church, referring to the region's reputation for having many churches. Others expressed sympathy for Weiler, who was raised by Meyers' family after his parents committed suicide. 'Whatever bad experience he had, we don't look at him any different than anybody who needs Jesus in their lives,' said Rev. Raymond Frizzelle, of First Assembly of God, which sits across the road from the motel. At nearby First Christian Church, associate minister Gary Reed said his first reaction was disbelief, followed by compassion for Weiler. 'We pray for him and our heart goes out to somebody that's feeling very disenfranchised and has a lot of anger and resentment toward the church and our faith tells us we have to have compassion,' Reed said.","Gregory Arthur Weiler II charged under anti-terrorism laws following 'bomb plot involving Molotov cocktails'
