Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is joining private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC. The firm announced Saturday that Geithner will serve as president and managing director of the firm starting March 1, 2014. Geithner played a central role in devising the U.S. government's response to the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Timothy Geithner: The former U.S. Treasury Secretary is joining private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC. The firm announced Saturday, Nov. 16, 2013, that Geithner will serve as president and managing director of the firm . Few Treasury secretaries received as much scrutiny. Supporters credited Geithner with helping prevent the recession from spiraling into a second Great Depression, but critics said he was too cozy with Wall Street. Geithner was widely associated with the TARP bank rescue, which was ushered through Congress by former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and then managed by Geithner after the Bush-Obama transition. Rescuer: Geithner was widely associated with the TARP bank rescue, which was ushered through Congress by former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and then managed by Geithner after the Bush-Obama transition . The controversial TARP was seen by some as a bailout of fat cat bankers. And some credited it with stabilizing the economy and helping avoid a deeper recession. When the crisis began, Geithner was president of the New York Federal Reserve, which helps oversee Wall Street. All told, he ran the New York Fed from 2003 until 2009. Geithner stepped down from Treasury in late January, days after President Barack Obama was sworn in for a second term, and signed a deal with Random House's Crown Publishers to write a behind-the-scenes book about the response to the economic crisis. Experience: When the crisis began, Geithner was president of the New York Federal Reserve, which helps oversee Wall Street. All told, he ran the New York Fed from 2003 until 2009 . The last of Obama's original economic advisers to leave the administration, he was succeeded as Treasury secretary by Jack Lew. Mr. Geithner has long considered a career in investing once his days in Washington ended. He has been reluctant to take a job with any banks, which he once regulated, and views private-equity firms and other investment managers as different from the institutions he oversaw as New York Fed chief. He had been weighing job options while writing an account of the financial crisis, due out next year. Since leaving public service, Geithner had been traveling on the speaking circuit and speaking at corporate events. Moving to finance: Geithner played a central role in devising the U.S. government's response to the financial crisis of 2008-2009 . Indeed, Mr. Geithner initially seemed unlikely to join Wall Street. While he garnered praise for helping to arrest the financial crisis from worsening, critics repeatedly assailed his policies during the Obama administration as too friendly to the nation’s mega-banks. One longstanding criticism is that he made permanent the idea that 'too big to fail' institutions would be bailed out if they ran into trouble. Now he will be joining Warburg Pincus, a 47-year-old private equity firm that oversees $35 billion in assets. Unlike rivals like the Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the firm has stayed privately held and low-profile. Still, its investments have included buying control of the eye-care company Bausch & Lomb and the luxury retailer Neiman Marcus. Both were sold in multibillion-dollar deals earlier this year.","Tim Geithner was widely associated with the TARP bank rescue in 2008-9 .

A baby who was born deaf is set to become one of the youngest in the country to undergo surgery  to improve her hearing. Seven-month-old Paige Evans will undergo a cochlear implant after doctors gave the go-ahead for the treatment. Cochlear implants can improve people's ability to hear and understand speech if they cannot benefit from a hearing aid. They enable children who are deaf to learn language, speak more clearly and perform better at school. Seven-month-old Paige Evans (pictured with parents Bethany and Paul) is one of the youngest ever children to receive a cochlear implant to help her hear. She was born profoundly deaf after mother contracted an infection while pregnant . Her parents say they are 'over the moon' that their young daughter may be able to hear in just a matter of weeks. Paige was born profoundly deaf on March 11 at the University Hospital of North Tees, in Stockton, after her mother Bethany Tait contracted group B streptococcus, a bacteria which causes severe infections in newborns. Her mother said she had a feeling 'from day one' that something was wrong with Paige's hearing. The implant should help Paige develop a sensation of hearing and speak more clearly . Then when she was just two weeks old, her parents were dealt a further blow when Paige was admitted to hospital after repeated vomiting. She was diagnosed with meningitis, linked to the bacteria from her mother's infection. Now doctors have contacted the family to confirm Paige is suitable for cochlear implant surgery. Miss Tait, 20, said: 'We just can’t believe it - we're dying for the phone to ring so we know when she's having the operation. We are just waiting for a date. 'I want really want Paige to be able to hear us. It was horrible to think she may never hear us say how much we love her. 'She also doesn’t respond as much as other babies, which does upset me.' Her parents have even chosen which design of implant their daughter will have when the procedure is carried out at James Cook University Hospital, in Middlesbrough. Miss Tait added: 'A member of staff from James Cook came over earlier this week and brought us an implant to show us what it looks like. 'It made it even more exciting when we got to pick the implant, a white waterproof one.' She added that she has already been looking for musical toys to buy Paige, in the hope she will at last be able to hear them. There are risks to the eight-hour procedure, which includes doctors delicately cutting behind the ear and drilling through the skull to insert the implant. But the couple say they have been assured by doctors that their baby is in safe hands. 'And no matter what happens, she was born that way so that's who she is and we love her,' said her mother. There are about 10,000 people in the UK . with cochlear implants and the number is on the rise, according to the . charity Action on Hearing Loss. The implants provide a sensation of . hearing to those who have severe to profound permanent deafness. While . the person may be able to hear some sounds, they cannot hear all the . sounds that make up human speech. Instead of making the sound louder, like . a hearing aid, the implant directly stimulates the auditory nerve (the . nerve that carries sound from the cochlea to the brain) using electrical . signals. Sound is picked up by the microphone in . the cochlear implant and processed into electrical signals that are . passed to the transmitter coil. The transmitter coil sends signals, by . radio wave, through the skin to the implanted receiver. The receiver . sends the signals down the wire to the electrodes in the cochlea. When the electrodes receive the signal, a . tiny electric current stimulates the auditory nerve to provide a . sensation of hearing. Having an implant put in takes several hours and is carried out under a general anaesthetic. The surgeon makes a cut behind the ear . and drills through the bone, into the middle ear and into the cochlea. A . ‘bed’ is made in the bone behind the ear to hold the receiver and . internal magnet, which the surgeon will insert and then close the . incision.","Paige Evans was born profoundly deaf after her mother contracted an infection while pregnant .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:49 EST, 12 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:50 EST, 12 November 2013 . A Colorado man is fighting to bring back his two daughters who he claims were abducted by his ex-wife to Argentina. Dennis Burns, of Snowmass, has spent the past three years missing out on the lives of his daughters, Sophia, 4, and Victoria, 7. His ex-wife, Ana Alianelli, took them from their home after a Colorado judge ordered that the children stay in the US after a bitter 13-month long custody battle following their divorce. A judge ordered their immediate return, but it was too late. The children were 3 and 1 years old at the time. Missing his children: Dennis Burns with his two daughters, Sophia, 4, left, and Victoria, 7, right, who were abducted to Argentina by their mother in 2010 . Happy family: Burns with his two daughters before they were kidnapped by their mother and relocated to Argentina . Alianelli had accused Burns of having abused her during their five-year marriage and requested to relocate with the children to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Burns, who works in real estate, objected that the move would make him ‘just an acquaintance, not a father’. The judge found the claims of abuse against Burns to be unfounded and declared Burns the primary residential parent. Burns said the ruling made him overjoyed. ‘I felt a sense of relief that was just beautiful. And I was like, 'I'm going to be able to spend time with my daughters, finally, and live with them and be able to teach them things, and show them things, and live here with them in Colorado',’ he told CNN. But three weeks later, in September 2010, the girls disappeared from the home, and have been in Argentina ever since. Overruled: A Colorado judge found the claims of abuse against Burns by his ex-wife to be unfounded . Kidnapped: In September 2010 the girls disappeared from their Snowmass home, and have been in Argentina ever since . He has been able to see his daughters, but he must travel to Buenos Aires at his own expense - a trip he's made seven times. And when he does visit his girls, he brings a witness. His lawyer, Caroline Langley, who specializes in child abduction laws and has expertise with Hague cases, said it was for his protection. ‘We always make sure that somebody goes with him, someone from the embassy, a neutral third party,’ Langley told CNN. Alianelli has refused to talk about the case. Her attorney, Daniel Mercado, provided a statement in Spanish, saying ‘Ms. Alianelli does not wish to make a comment with respect to the case.’ There are currently thousands of similar unresolved international custody cases in the United States, and the U.S. State Department receives about 1,200 new cases each year. Visits: When Burns goes to Buenos Aires to see his children he always brings a witness for his own protection . Argentina is one of the more than 80 signatory countries of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, a 1980 treaty by which nations work together to solve international abduction cases quickly. According to the treaty, the first custody hearing is supposed to be held six to eight weeks from when the applications to have the children returned are filed. Burns' first hearing was in December 2012, more than two years after Victoria and Sophia were taken. Langley said the longer time that passes, the more strongly a child will begin to ‘identify with their abductor’. ‘The psychological trauma to the children starts on that slippery slope where it's very, very difficult to pull them back from being so aligned with the abductor,’ she told CNN. Burns' mother, Marie Burns, who lives in New Jersey, says she cries every time she sees a girl who looks like Victoria. Emotional: Burns' mother, Marie Burns, says she cries every time she sees a girl who looks like Victoria . 'A little girl comes in (a restaurant) with her dad or her family and happened to look like Victoria and I'm sitting there eating with a friend, and suddenly, I'm bawling,' she said. Fight for the cause: Burns, left, pictured with another father who dealt with a similar case, David Goldman, center, and Congressman Tipton of Colorado, right, has set up a website to garner support . Burns must wait for the legal process . to take its course. An appellate court in Buenos Aires ruled in favor . of him bringing Victoria and Sophia back to the US, but Alianelli . appealed the decision. Burns is now waiting for the Supreme Court of Buenos Aires to hear his case. A website has been set up to seek support for Burns' cause and raise awareness about international child abduction. It includes a petition urging the government of Argentina to honour the U.S. court ruling and return Sophia and Victoria to their father's custody. The website also asks people to press their members of Congress to pass a bill introduced in October that would strengthen safeguards against international child abduction. He has been working alongside another American father, David Goldman, who knows exactly what Burns is going through. Goldman's 5½-year journey to get his son, Sean, returned from Brazil after he was . abducted by his mother drew international attention, and gives Burns . hope that he will succeed as well. Burns and Goldman have been meeting with various politicians, including Congressman Chris Smith, whose recent International Child Abduction Prevention legislation cleared the Committee of Foreign Affairs. The bill will now head to the House Floor. A dream: Burns says he just wishes to see his two daughters every day to 'be able to hug them and love them' Burns with Congressman Chris Smith, whose recent International Child Abduction Prevention legislation cleared the Committee of Foreign Affairs . In the meantime, Burns says the financial strain has forced him to file for bankruptcy and foreclose on his home. He . lives in a one-bedroom apartment filled with photos of his daughters in . every room, on every wall. Their tiny coats still hang on hooks near . his front door. But he says Goldman's success story gives him strength. Goldman and his son were at the center of a long and bitter international custody row. The Christmas Eve reunion in 2009 ordered by . Brazil's Supreme Court capped a five-year legal battle by Goldman, against the Brazilian family of his ex-wife, who died in . childbirth in 2008. She had remarried after her divorce with Goldman. Together again: Goldman and his son Sean at an NBA game in 2010 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Goldman says his now 13-year-old son 'is thriving' after coming back to the US . ‘He's thriving,’ says Goldman of his now 13-year-old son. ‘He's playing lacrosse, he's playing basketball on the travel team. He just came home yesterday and they had their (school) pictures.’ Burns says he dreams of the days when his life can go back to normal. ‘I don't have the opportunity with them to get them out of bed in the morning, make them breakfast, take them to school,’ he said. ‘I just want to be able to know that they are there every day and be able to hug them and love them.’","Dennis Burns' daughters, Sophia, 4, and Victoria, 7, were abducted three years ago .

When former chef Glen Battensby lost almost half his body weight by swapping his diet of fast food for a healthy one, he was delighted. But now his joy has been cut short because he can't get rid of the excess skin his weight loss has left behind. Glen, 55, was hoping that the NHS would pay for surgery to remove the skin but he has been told there is no money available for the operation. Glenn Battensby is half the man he used to be after shedding 11 stone, but has now been left with one stone of spare skin . Glen spent years as a chef preparing meals at restaurants in Leeds but his problems didn't start until he became a disc jockey more than 20 years ago and would eat burgers for dinner . 'I was delighted when I lost the weight but then I have been left in tears and depressed because of what the dieting has left behind,' said Glen, who went down from 21st to 11st 10lbs in 18 months. 'It's alright when I am wearing clothes but it looks terrible when I strip off at the gym or to go swimming.' Glen, from Leeds, West Yorks, spent years as a chef preparing meals at restaurants in Leeds but his problems didn't start until he became a disc jockey more than 20 years ago. 'It was a case of finishing work in the early hours and then going for a kebab or a burger,' he said. 'After a while the pounds just started piling on and it left me a physical wreck.' The fat laden fast food meant Glen, who is not married, suffered diabetes, high blood pressure and thyroid problems. Glen, 55, was hoping that the NHS would pay for surgery to remove the skin but he has been told there is no money available for the operation . 'My health was so bad that I could hardly climb the stairs at home and I was wheezing and out of breath,' he said, adding: 'My weight wasn't caused by medical problems but by my lifestyle.' At one stage while he was under the care of a hospital dietician he was told he could have a gastric band if he lost two stone. 'I lost the weight and they wouldn't give me the band because I had managed to lose the weight by dieting.' Now Glen has kept to his strict diet but is angry that the NHS can't help him further. 'The skin left behind after dieting looks ugly and it makes me depressed thinking that I can not have surgery to remove it. Sometimes I end up in tears.' He said he was so large that he found he hard to walk up stairs so completely changed his lifestyle .

Despite speaking of her new-found . confidence after the operation, the 23-year-old now says she was rushed . through the surgery and is seeking compensation for clinical negligence . and emotional distress. Glen said: 'How can women get cosmetic surgery on the NHS but I can't. 'I have spoken to my doctor but I was told they didn't have the money for the surgery. 'It was great to lose all that fat but now I depressed because of it.' In a bid to keep his weight down . Glen stays off the kebabs and burgers but as a former chef, he still . makes them for party nights when he DJs. He also spends much of his time baking cakes for family friends but added: 'I love making them but I don't eat them.' The NHS Clinical Commission said that Glen's treatment was 'not routinely funded' by the NHS. Requests for treatment have to be supported by clinical evidence and referred to a panel and they make the funding decision. The NHS only pays for certain cosmetic procedures which can include nose reshaping if someone is having breathing problems, the surgical correction of ears that stick out for under 16s and breast reduction for women if the weight of the patient's breasts is causing back problems.

"By . Deni Kirkova . PUBLISHED: . 05:22 EST, 14 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:38 EST, 14 October 2013 . Following on from singer Cher's damning statement about Miley Cyrus' VMA tongue-wagging antics, oral hygiene experts say it's evidence that she is stressed. The pop legend, 67, told USA Today: 'Chick, don't stick out your tongue if it's coated.' Now, Get The Gloss writer Emma Gunavardhana gets the lowdown on what the tongue can reveal about our overall health... Miley Cyrus, pictured at the NY release party for her new album Bangerz . on Tuesday, shows off her tongue . Some of Miley Cyrus' recent antics . may have left you feeling like an amateur gynecologist – that VMA . performance, those Terry Richardson pictures… . As . it happens such intimate access and some close inspection has given . away something about her health, you just have to look two feet higher - . at her tongue. We weren't . the only ones to notice something was a little 'off' but perhaps Cher . said it best: 'Chick, don't stick out your tongue if it's coated.' Agreeing with Cher is Shabir Daya, . co-founder of victoriahealth.com: 'Your tongue is a window into what's . happening in your body; colour, coating and cracks are all indicators of . the state of your health.' Cara Delevingne has been at it too choosing a protruding tongue and rock sign as her pap-pose of choice. They may think their tongue-poking gives nothing away but actually they couldn't reveal more. At one point Miley . licks a sledgehammer in the Terry Richardson inspired video for Wrecking Ball . Daya reveals: 'A healthy tongue has a thin, white and moist coating and any deviation from this indicates possible problem.' Oral . B Smile Director Dr Uchenna Okoye agrees: 'A thin coating is normal but . a thick white coating could indicate candidiasis or oral thrush, which . is a fungus.' Chinese . medicine actually uses the tongue as a matter of course to diagnose the . state of someone's health and given that the mouth harbours anywhere . between 300-400 species of bacteria, it's vital to have a dental hygiene . routine that includes cleaning the tongue. Maybe Miley wasn't making out with that sledgehammer in her Wrecking Ball video, but cleaning her tongue on its rough surface instead? You may brush your teeth morning, noon and night but according to Daya that might not be enough. 'Small protrusions in the tongue can harbour food allowing bacteria and fungi to thrive and this results in a whitish tongue,' she says. Essentially clean teeth can be almost immediately 'reinfected' by a dirty tongue. Miley was in the midst of her break-up with Liam Hemsworth when she took to the stage with Robin Thicke in August and interestingly the tongue is a sound stress indicator. 'Stress, particularly on-going stress, can cause deeper cracks in the tongue since stress releases inflammatory hormones,' says Daya. The former child star loves to play up to her bad girl image, especially at her MTV VMAs appearance . Okoye recommends using a mouthwash twice a day and Daya suggests the Peri Gum Mouth Wash Concentrate, £17.95, which contains seven herbal extracts that'll naturally improve any gum and mouth disorders. Alternatively there are more and more products available to help keep your oral health tip-top, including the Dr Oliver Mouth Cleanser, £16, available at Space NK that normalizes pH levels in the mouth. While a slightly more old-fashioned but no less effective option is the OraBrush Tongue Cleaner, £5.10 available from Boots that you simply draw from back-to-front along your tongue to scrape off unwanted nasties - for tackling bad breath it's a winner. We may know more about Miley than we'd care to but thanks to her tongue-poking she may have helped us know more about ourselves.

So it is appropriate that the coats of arms of the Houses of Middleton and Windsor are firmly entwined as well. Although Kate’s ancestors include carpenters and coal miners, they had their own heraldic design drawn up in 2011, shortly before the royal wedding. Kensington Palace released this photo of the new conjugal coat of arms for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . And yesterday the Duchess of . Cambridge’s personal emblem was linked, for the first time, with that of . her husband to create a new ‘Conjugal Coat of Arms’. Designed by the College of Arms in London, it represents William and Kate, in heraldic terms, as a married couple. The . Middleton coat of arms – which was applied for by Kate’s father Michael . – features three leafy acorns to represent his children. Acorns . were chosen for the analogy that they grow into great oaks. Oak is also . a  symbol of England and strength, and West Berkshire, where the . children were brought up, has many oak trees. In . the centre of Kate’s emblem is a gold chevron representing the . Duchess’s mother, Carole, at the heart of the family. Her family name . was Goldsmith. The insignia will be the couple's coat of arms forever, but parts of it could change . The two thin . white chevrons on either side indicate, remarkably, the family’s love of . skiing and mountains, while the background colours of red and blue were . chosen as they are the principal colours of the flag of the UK and . match William’s own shield. William’s design is a version of the Royal Coat of Arms which was granted to him by the Queen on his 18th birthday. It . shows the various royal emblems of the United Kingdom: the three lions . of England, the lion of Scotland and the harp of Ireland. It . is surrounded by a blue garter bearing the motto Honi soit qui mal y . pense – Shame to those who think evil of it – which symbolises the Order . of the Garter of which he is a Knight Companion. Both shields are . supported by the Duke of Cambridge’s ‘supporters’ – a royal lion and . unicorn, each wearing a three pointed collar, known as a label. Garter Principal King of Arms and Senior Herald . in England, Thomas Woodcock unveils the new Coat of Arms for Kate . Middleton's family in 2011 . The . label has a red scallop shell derived from the Spencer coat of arms, . which has been used by the ancestors of Princess Diana for centuries. Flowing . out from the top of the Conjugal Coat of Arms is ‘mantling’, which . represents the slashed cloth hung around the necks of knights fighting . in the heat of the Middle East during the Crusades. Timothy Duke, of the . College of Arms, said: ‘Any married couple who are both entitled to . arms are entitled to combine them in a  Conjugal Coat of Arms. ‘There . are different rules and conventions as to how this works, depending on . who the individual is, but as the Duke of Cambridge is a Knight of the . Order of the Garter his is encircled by the blue garter bearing its . motto. ‘As his wife is not, . a wreath was made to balance hers out decoratively. Obviously that will . change if she, in the future, is made a member herself.’ A . spokesman for Kensington  Palace added: ‘The Conjugal Arms will be the . couple’s coat of arms forever, but parts of it could change as their own . circumstances and roles change. ‘It was approved by the Queen earlier this year and can now be shown publicly for the first time.","New Conjungal Coat of Arms will represent the couple forever .

They have been together 32 years and last night Sting and Trudie Styler looked as loved up as ever as they posed on the red carpet. The singer, 62, was supporting his wife at a party to celebrate the opening of her latest play, The Seagull, in New York. She's taking centre stage in the Chekhov play in the city the family have made their home. Despite both growing up in Britain and having a number of properties here, the actress told The Times they . prefer living in the U.S. after being 'treated unkindly' in their home . country. Happy New Yorkers: Trudie Styler and Sting attend an opening night party for her new play, The Seagull, in New York where they now live . She said: 'I don't want to criticise . my country but there are times I feel Sting and myself have been treated . unkindly. I feel much more relaxed here, not having to second guess . myself.' She added: 'Rock stars' wives have never been given an easy time. They weren't nice about Linda McCartney until she died.' The couple - who wore matching black outfits - are famous for having one of the most rock solid romances in showbiz. So what's the secret to their lasting union? Styler, 59, told The Times they still have 'chemistry' after all these years and share similar interests. She said: 'There's the chemistry, that's undeniable, and it's still there. I love him more each day. Also, we like each other.' On their wedding day: The couple married in 1992 and renewed their vows this year . She added: 'We laugh at the same . things, we're Fifties kids - we have the same points of reference, like . Morecambe and Wise. We're very alike: we both have working class . backgrounds and had similar struggles trying to carve out identities in . the arts.' She said their relationship contrasts to that of her parents who raised her and her sisters in a council house in Stoke Prior. 'I realise now, when I see my relationship with my own husband, that they had a rather humdrum relationship,' she said. Then: Sting and Trudie in the Eighties . Now: 32 years later, Trudie said 'I love him more each day' When it comes to why Sting thinks their marriage . has lasted, he joked: 'Our relationship is successful because I make all . the big decisions and she makes all the small ones. Luckily, in 32 years . together, we've never had to make any big decisions.' The . pair met in the early Eighties when she was famous for her role in TV . show Poldark and he was hitting the charts with the Police after giving . up a career as a teacher in Northumberland (under his real name Gordon . Sumner). He was married at the time to actress Frances Tomelty, with whom he has two children. They separated in 1982 and Styler . became his new partner not long after. But Styler refuses to elaborate . on the early days of their romance saying, 'I don't ever talk about this . chapter because it exposes too many people whose privacy should be . respected.' Styler and Sting tied the knot in 1992 (renewing their vows in a ceremony in India earlier this year), and they have four children - Mickey, Jake, Coco and Giacomo. During their marriage, his music career has continued to flourish while her work 'took a back seat for a while'. But she pointed out: 'It's not like I didn't do anything'. She set up two film production companies, Xingu Films and Maven Pictures. The latter produced the recently released adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel Filth starring James McAvoy.","Couple were out in New York to celebrate opening of her new play .

"By . Richard Price . PUBLISHED: . 16:58 EST, 25 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:34 EST, 26 September 2013 . With two young children, a beautiful home in leafy Surrey and a thriving business, Jane Wall-Budden seemed to have it all. Like so many of her contemporaries, however, the 30-year-old also had a cashflow problem. With her business, making designer cot bumpers for babies, growing quickly, she needed liquidity to keep up the momentum while retaining the family’s comfortable lifestyle. For most people this would entail going to see the bank manager, cap in hand, to beg for a loan. Jane, however, opted for a different tack. Financial sense: Jane Wall-Budden pawned a Cartier and a Rolex that were just sat in her drawer . Tucked away at her Byfleet home were two expensive watches, a Cartier and a Rolex, which she promptly took to the local pawnbrokers and walked out with a £3,000 loan. 'I needed a cash injection to invest in a new product, which I felt would market well,' she says. 'It made good business sense, but the bank just saw me as a little cottage industry and wasn't interested. 'Frankly, pawning these watches - which I just kept in a bedside drawer - was the only way I could get my hands on a lump sum. I would say to anyone who was in the same position and had something lying around that wasn’t of huge personal value to do the same.' It is a stark change from the traditional image of pawnbrokers' clients: impoverished strugglers hocking the family silver for cash to buy shoes for the children. In this day and age, they are more likely to be struggling to pay the private school fees. Risk worth taking: Lorraine Giacomelli was happy to pawn her designer handbags and shoes when she needed extra cash . For Jane is far from alone. Middle-class families are turning to pawnbrokers like never before. Why? Well, David Braithwaite, from Citrus Financial Management, says there are certain advantages to using a pawnbroker. 'It is probably cheaper than something like a payday loan,' he says. 'But the big advantage of a pawnbroker is that you do not have to go through normal credit checks, like you would if you were applying for a bank loan or credit card. 'So it can be viewed as a simpler, no questions asked way of getting money. And you get it very quickly as well.' 'Although I am a stay-at-home mum, with careful budgeting I'm confident I can raise the money to get them back' A pawnbroker typically lends up to 50 per cent of the value of an item for six months. The customer then repays the loan plus interest, which tends to be between 2 and 7 per cent (compared with an average 19.5 per cent on a bank overdraft and 17.3 per cent on a credit card). There is, of course, a catch. If the customer is unable to pay back the pawnbroker within the time stipulated in the contract, the pawnbroker takes possession and sells the items to recoup the value of the loan and interest. For entrepreneurial types in particular, however, it is a risk worth taking. In 1971, fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg famously raised cash to launch her fledgling wrap-dress business by pawning her diamond ring. The dress became her signature and, today, her business is a multi-million-dollar corporation. And today, with banks offering very few traditional-style loans, luxury pawnbroking is a growth industry. Take James Constantinou, 45, who runs Prestige Pawnbrokers in Weybridge, Surrey. Originally a property developer, he found himself living in an upmarket area, surrounded by successful businessmen and professional footballers in million-pound houses. Growth industry: Business is booming as it's more difficult to get bank loans . However, while many of the middle class locals were asset rich, they were often cash poor. Ideal clients for a pawnbroker, then, and his highly lucrative business was born. Mr Constantinou's premises are discreet and plain, with a workmanlike counter and sofas that make it resemble a bank more than anything else. The secure locked units behind the scenes, however, are packed with expensive jewellery, designer handbags and dresses. Elsewhere, in underground vaults, he is safeguarding rare books and paintings, while secure garages in a different location store row upon row of prestige cars which have been pawned by their owners for ready cash. Mr Constantinou, who sold property interests to set up his business in 2009, during the early months of the recession, says: 'I knew people living in million-pound houses with Ferraris on the drive who were short on funds - people who had built up wealth in cars and fine paintings but couldn't use them as collateral at the bank. Ring recycle . The most popular pawn items are gold rings, according to the National Pawnbrokers' Association . 'They come in here and within ten minutes they can walk out with a large amount of cash or a bank draft.' It is not just about high-rolling businessmen hocking Picassos and Lamborghinis, however. Over recent years, women have become just as much a mainstay of his pawn- broking business. Lorraine Giacomelli, 41, from Richmond in South-West London, turned to a pawnbroker when she was struggling to pay for the upkeep of her home last year. 'Money has been tight since I got divorced,' says Lorraine, a mother of two, 'and when my bathroom flooded I didn't have the funds to fix it. I wasn't covered by my insurance, and while I could have got a loan or used a credit card, I didn’t want to be in debt - which is why I didn’t ask my ex-husband either. But he had been very generous while we were married and a friend pointed out that I probably had thousands of pounds-worth of goods tucked away that I could pawn. So I rooted through my wardrobe and found a pair of £1,000 Christian Louboutin shoes, a £2,000 Chanel handbag and a Hermès bag that had originally cost £17,000. Middle-class clientele: James Constantinou runs a pawnbrokers in Surrey . 'At the pawnbrokers I was offered £4,000 for the lot, at a monthly interest of 5 per cent. The important thing was that it was enough to fix my bathroom. 'Although I am a stay-at-home mum, with careful budgeting I'm confident I can raise the money to get them back - and if I don’t and I lose the bags and shoes, I won’t be totally heartbroken. 'That's why it's a win-win situation. I got the money I needed and I’m not left in debt in real terms. I felt quite proud that I didn’t have to ask anyone for money.' Earlier this year, she went back and pawned a Cartier watch worth £4,000 for £1,000, to raise money to take her children on holiday. As Phil Diaper, director of the national pawnbroker chain Suttons & Robertsons, puts it: 'It's a middle-class thing, with people needing money for school fees or tax bills.' But anyone tempted should heed Lorraine’s words of warning. 'Only get what you need and make sure that you’re going to be able to get the money to get that back if it really means something,' she says. 'The last thing you want to do is lose it.'","Middle-class families are turning to pawnbrokers like never before .

The TV presenter has unveiled a range of bedding for BHS, so FEMAIL caught up with her for some serious pillow talk. 'I was asked if I would be interested in doing a homeware range and immediately said yes because something that I love doing in my own life is making my home look nice,' she explained. In bed with Holly: Miss Willoughby has unveiled a range of vintage inspired bedding for BHS . 'People always say ""what do you do in your home life?"" and I don't really have anything, all I do is work and be a mum but if there was one hobby I have, it's decorating my home.' Holly, who juggles motherhood, TV presenting, fashion designing for Very and modelling duties, has been very hands on with her BHS range. The 32-year-old spent two years putting together mood boards from her inspirations and she couldn't be happier with the final result. 'From goodness knows what age, I've always bought home magazines, taken out cuttings and kept scrap books. So it's quite natural to do this and I wanted to make bedrooms that I'd want to sleep in,' she explained. Hobby: The 32-year-old, who has been working on her designs for two years, says that she's always had a passion for decorating . While there's plenty of vintage-inspired lace, feminine prints and eye-catching pearl fringes, Holly has ensured that her range appeals to men too. 'I have a husband that has a pillow phobia, he hates that I put cushions and pillows everywhere. So I have added nautical and masculine touches to my range. I like things to be really beautiful but really practical to use.' So what's Holly's own boudoir like? 'My bed is my favourite place to be in the whole world. I have candles everywhere and laundry sprays so when I get into bed it smells nice,' she said. Low maintenance: Holly, whose face greets the nation every day on This Morning, explains that she swears by make-up wipes . Much to the disappointment of her male fans, Holly - who regularly tops Sexiest Women In The World polls - takes a 'comfort first' approach when it comes to bedroom attire. 'What do I sleep in? Well, I've got a onesie, it's definitely onesie weather,' she said. But you won't see her pulling on a 'twosie' - a the two person onesie - with her husband Dan anytime soon. 'I'm not sure about twosies, I like my onesie for myself, there's no room for anyone else in it,' she laughed. Holly also shared her pre-bedtime beauty regime with us - and you'll be surprised to know that, despite her glossy and polished looks, she's a low-maintenance girl. 'Make-up wipes are my saviour. I used to be useless at taking my make-up off at night, I'd wake up with a print of my face on the pillow. 'You can get away with that when you're younger but I'm at the point where I think ""Holly, it's time to grow up"". 'Liz Earle do some great wipes, they're really nice and organic. I tend to use lots of Liz Earle stuff and love her day moisturiser,' she said. So how does she keep her skin looking so flawless despite early morning stints on This Morning? (Earlier in the day she had mediated . between Peaches Geldof and Katie Hopkins, who argued over parenting in a debate that carried on after the cameras stopped . rolling, revealed Holly). 'I am one of life's big sleepers, I could sleep anywhere, any time. Welcome to Holly's boudoir: Ranging in price from £15-£100, Holly's range is feminine and French vintage inspired . Fresh: Holly wanted her designs to be pretty yet practical and spent two years pulling together inspiration . 'I go to bed early unless I'm out. I am a sneak into bed at 9pm gal. I'd go earlier, but it's wrong to miss out. 'Most mornings I wake up and go ""it's OK, you'll be getting into bed again tonight"". 'Left to my own devices I would just sleep and sleep, that's why having kids was such a surprise. I'm like ""what do you mean they wake up in the night? Do I really have to get up now?!"",' she laughed. Aside from juggling young children, early mornings and new projects (she has also recently released a children's book with her sister), Holly couldn't be happier right now. 'I'm in a really good place at the moment with work and life. I've had afternoons off which is unheard of and I can spend time with my daughter when she isn't at nursery, which is really nice,' she said. It seems like life is a sweet dream for TV's favourite face. One for the men: Holly ensured that there were some masculine touches in her designs and loves this reversible, nautical blue duvet cover . Sweet dreams: Holly, 32, loves decorating her room with candles and scented room fresheners . Holly’s For The Home range is available at BHS (www.bhs.co.uk).

Barry Howell has gone on trial accused of attacking a woman in Manchester city centre after DNA evidence was linked to his son . A father was arrested on suspicion of carrying out a brutal knife-point rape 24 years ago after evidence was matched to his son’s DNA, a court heard. Barry Howell has now gone on trial accused of attacking the woman in the city centre in November 1989. It is alleged that Mr Howell jumped out at the woman as she walked back to her car in Red Bank, on the outskirts of Manchester city centre. The victim is said to have screamed as Mr Howell allegedly ran a knife across her throat and said 'can you feel that?’ before ‘dragging’ her off the street and onto wasteland. Police were able to recover DNA from a sample from the alleged victim belonging to her alleged attacker at the time – but were unable to identify who it belonged to. Manchester Crown Court heard that in November last year the sample was run through the database, and a link was found between the DNA profile of the suspected attacker, and the DNA profile of Mr Howell’s son. Mr Howell, 56, of Burnage, denies rape. The court heard that following his arrest he told police he had a consensual encounter with the woman. He told police that at the time he was living with his mother in Harpurhey after separating from his wife. Andrew Mackintosh, prosecuting told the court that the alleged victim, an office worker, was passing through railway arches in the Red Bank area when she was set upon at around 6.30pm on November 22, 1989. The attacker is said to have put his arm round her throat, ran a blade across it, and put his hand around her mouth before dragging her on to wasteland, where he ordered her to lie face down before raping her, the court heard. It is alleged that Mr Howell jumped out at the woman as she walked back to her car in Red Bank, on the outskirts of Manchester city centre . He is alleged to have kissed her before apologising, telling her not to tell the police, and then fleeing. Mr Mackintosh added: 'At that time science was not such as would enable (the DNA sample) to be linked to any person. 'As the years passed the science relating to the examination of DNA improved and new techniques were developed - one of these techniques was one which enabled DNA found on a sample to be matched to a relative whose DNA may appear on the national DNA database.' When police went to Mr Howell’s home in January this year and asked him to provide a sample he refused ‘on principle’ the court heard. Manchester Crown Court heard Mr Howell put his hand around her mouth before dragging her on to wasteland . But when they returned the following morning with a search warrant he provided a sample which was a ‘one in a billion’ match to that recovered from the victim. Mr Howell then provided a statement to police detailing a consensual encounter with the complainant. Asked what reason she would have to make a false complaint, he said: “Is there ever a reason – it happens, doesn’t it?’. Concluding the opening of the case, Mr Mackintosh said to the jury: 'It’s the Crown’s case that having heard the evidence you can be sure this was not a consensual sexual encounter – it was a brutal knife-point rape.' The case continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Barry Howell was charged after evidence was linked to his son's DNA .

John Grant was at a Wisconsin bar during the Bears-Packers game with his wife when they each wagered that if the other's team won, they'd be in for a shock. Grant's Bears won 27-20 and he took his spoils by repeatedly Tasering wife Nicole. She would eventually call the police, landing Grant behind bars with a possible six-year sentence for carrying the weapon, which is illegal in Wisconsin without a permit.

Andy Murray rarely talks about the Dunblane massacre because he finds it 'just too hard' to revisit the childhood trauma, he reveals in his new autobiography. The Wimbledon champion was an eight-year-old pupil at Dunblane Primary School in March 1996 when a gunman opened fire on classrooms, killing 17 people. However, since finding fame he has almost never spoken publicly about his memories of the shooting. Trauma: Andy Murray, pictured with his girlfriend Kim Sears, rarely talks about the Dunblane massacre . Star: Mr Murray won Wimbledon this year, the first British man to do so for 77 years . Family: Andy Murray, bottom right, with his parents William and Judy and older brother Jamie . In his latest memoir, Seventy-Seven: My Road to Wimbledon Glory, Mr Murray says he prefers to focus on how his home town in Perthshire has rebuilt itself rather than dwelling on the past. 'It's part of my history which I can't get away from, and you can't just turn those emotions off and on for every interviewer who wants to talk to you,' he write in extracts from the book serialised by The Times. 'It's just too hard. The future is what matters most and seeing the town now, seeing how Dunblane has risen: that fills me with massive pride.' The 26-year-old world number four adds that he was touched to hear that a pastor had used his own story to comfort the family of one of the children killed in the Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, Connecticut last year. Return: In September last year, Mr Murray visited his home town of Dunblane after winning an Olympic gold medal and posed with a postbox painted gold in his honour . Crowds: The star was nervous about how he would be received, but was greeted by hundreds of well-wishers . Horror: A mother comforting her children outside Dunblane Primary School in the wake of the shooting . Mr Murray revisited Dunblane, where he owns a hotel, last year after he had won the U.S. open and a gold medal at the Olympics. In his book, he reveals that he was 'really nervous' to return to his home town and was uncertain as to how he would be received by locals. However, hundreds of residents flooded the streets to catch a glimpse of the tennis star, and he write of his amusement at being offered free gifts by the newsagent from whom he used to steal penny sweets as a child. Mr Murray was pictured alongside a Dunblane postbox which had been painted gold to celebrate his Olympic medal. He left the town as a teenager and moved to Barcelona in order to focus full time on his burgeoning tennis career. Elsewhere in the book, he pays tribute to the steadfast support of his girlfriend Kim Sears, and explains how coach Ivan Lendl inspired him to recover from the pain of losing his first four Grand Slam finals. Passion: Mr Murray's mother Judy has always been outspoken when it comes to tennis . Andy Murray's mother Judy has a reputation as a passionate supporter of her son - and in his new memoir, the star admits that her fiery personality has long been evident. He denies that his mother is 'pushy', but reveals that when he was a child her competitive streak showed through and sometimes resulted in a torrent of bad language. The British number one recounts a mixed doubles game which he and Mrs Murray played together when he was no older than 11. Mr Murray write: 'That didn't stop Mum from having a right old swear and that's something I can see in me as well.' Although he insists that his mother and father never pushed him to progress in his career too quickly, he praises them for allowing him to take big decisions such as moving to Spain. His older brother Jamie, a professional tennis player who won the mixed doubles competition at Wimbledon in 2007, suffered a 'really bad experience' when he went to tennis academy aged 12, but Mr Murray says that this did not make his parents any more reluctant for him to move abroad for the sake of his career.

A drama teacher who asked a 17-year-old boy for sex and played a game with pupils called Who’s a Virgin? has been banned from teaching. Lindsay Black, 28, also urged sixth-formers to mime sexual acts at the Roman Catholic school where she taught, a disciplinary panel was told. She paid particular attention to a teenager who was performing in the school musical, and revealed to pupils that she fantasised about having sex in the drama class and cheating on her fiancé. Drama teacher: Lindsay Black, 28, told the schoolboy she had fantasised about performing a sex act on him and pestered him for sex . Black sent text messages, emails and Facebook messages to the 17-year-old boy, asking him to meet up for sex. It was said the schoolboy, referred to as Pupil A, showed other pupils text messages from Black as he rehearsed for We Will Rock You, a show based on the songs of rock band Queen. English teacher Abigail Watts said: ‘I heard comments from other pupils about Miss Black liking pupils and I asked what this meant. They said she had been Facebook messaging Pupil A – she told him she had a dream about them having sex.’ She added: ‘They had not met up but they had been talking about it.’ The hearing was told Black ‘flirted’ with the boy during lessons and sent him a message saying how she dreamt about him. Sex teacher: Miss Black also got the class to play a game of 'I have never' and questioned them about sex . The trained actress met the teenager while working on maternity cover at St Joseph’s Roman Catholic High School in Newport, South Wales. She contacted him on Facebook asking about his coursework – then began sending him messages talking about sex and alcohol. Black told the boy she had a dream in which she performed a sex act on him, then asked him to meet up with her for sex. A Professional Conduct Committee of the General Teaching Council of Wales heard she even grilled the boy’s girlfriend about their relationship. The hearing was told that Black played a game in which she asked her sixth form class, ‘who’s a virgin?’ and made pupils stand up if they had not yet had sex. She also played a game named ‘I Have Never’ in which she would ask them if they had performed various sex acts. The hearing was told Black then encouraged the teenagers to mime sex acts and spent time talking to pupils about sex. When Black was confronted by the head of drama she told him it was just an exercise to get pupils ‘into character’. Colleague Sandra Davies said: ‘Pupils told me that during drama classes Miss Black would talk about sex and she turned the lessons on to a sexual theme. She said she wanted to cheat on her fiancé once before getting married and that she fantasised about having sex on a table in the drama class. ‘They played a game called “I Have Never” where she would ask them things [about sex]. She would then get the pupils to act out the acts in question.’ The hearing in Cardiff was told how Pupil A’s academic performance had suffered as a result of the messages and he had to re-sit his AS levels. Black was interviewed by police following the allegations in 2011 but no further action  was taken. She later admitted engaging in inappropriate and sexually explicit conversations with a pupil via Facebook. Drama: The teacher, who was doing maternity cover at St Joseph's Catholic High School in Newport, has been struck off . Black, who did not attend the hearing, denied talking to her class about sex and said the pupils had made up the allegations. But the panel found she had held discussions of an ‘inappropriate and sexually explicit nature’ with pupils. They found her actions amount to unacceptable professional conduct and banned her from teaching. Committee chairman Peter Williams said: ‘The conduct in question seriously affected pupils and was not an isolated lapse. Black’s actions are fundamentally incompatible with being a registered teacher.’ Black declined to comment at her house in Pontypridd after the hearing. Paul Bennett, chairman of governors at St Joseph’s RC High School, said: ‘The school takes allegations of unprofessional conduct very seriously and acts swiftly when such allegations are made.’","Lindsay Black, 28, told the boy she had a dream about them having sex .

A group of 13 U.S. Marines returning home from Afghanistan welcomed back with first class treatment after generous fliers gave up their luxury seats so the comrades-in-arms could fly together in comfort. What's more, when the Marines arrived at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Monday, they were greeted by an impromptu parade of police, firefighters and other travelers who gathered on just one hour's notice to honor their service. An elderly retired Marine working for the USO was responsible for the heroes welcome. He even arranged for their plane to taxi beneath an arch of water from Chicago fire trucks after their landed in the Windy City. After their plane taxied beneath an arch of water from fire department hoses in what is called a water salute, the Marines walked into the terminal and were met by a small crowd of cheering USO volunteers, firefighters, police officers and airport workers. Heroes' welcome: The Marines, who were returning from a tour in Afghanistan, were honored by local police and firefighters when they arrived at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport (pictured) Service: Capt. Pravin Rajan (left) and Major Matthew Winkelbauer (right), two of the Marines who received the star treatment, have thanked the staff of American Airline, O'Hare airport and their fellow fliers . A short time later, boarding another jet for San Diego, the Marines learned that American Airlines - which has a policy to upgrade servicemen and women in uniform whenever possible - had six empty seats in first class for the group. That gesture was followed by seven first-class passengers who jumped out of their seats for the other Marines so they could sit together. It meant the Marines could enjoy leather seats, more legroom and state-of-the-art headphones. ‘It was incredibly touching,’ Captain Pravin Rajan said in a telephone interview from Camp Pendleton in California. ‘Afghanistan is a very complex and ambiguous war ... and a difficult thing to keep track of so it is amazing when we are 10 years (into) a war and there is still that kind of community, that level of support, the level of willingness to go out of one's way.’ Lindsy Wadas, director of the USO Center at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport with U.S. Marine Major Matthew Winkelbauer, left .

Stephanie Hare, a native of Illinois who now works in England, called the USO at O'Hare and explained that her fiance, Rajan, who had served seven months in Afghanistan, was with a dozen other Marines on a plane bound for Chicago from Baltimore. ‘I just thought if they could get them some Chicago pizza, champagne or something, that would mean a lot,’ she said. On the other end of the line was John Colas, a 74-year-old former Marine USO volunteer. He told Hare he'd try to do something in the hour or so before the flight landed. But he cautioned that while volunteers make an effort to welcome military personnel whenever they come through the airport, he wasn't sure he could pull anything off in such a short time. Colas got on the phone with the police and fire departments, the airlines and anyone else he could think of. Marine Capt.

Passengers leap over seats in the race to grab a spot, while others swing round poles to land themselves a seat . In a matter of seconds the carriage is already bursting with commuters - but there is still room for more as people dive in . As the panic to secure a space on the metro intensifies, people push others out of the way to squeeze like sardines inside the metro . One person clutches the back of their skull after being kicked by another passenger who uses a pole to lift themselves over a chair... and ends up dragging their feet over other commuters' skulls. The empty carriage is immediately filled by the rush of people who race in, with some people running down the aisle to try and secure a space. And forget chivalry - it's every person for themselves as young and old fight for a spot on the service. The astonishing video, from Tagnana, shows just how cramped the carriages are as people rush to squeeze into. But it's not only Venezuela that suffers from crowded services.

The city is known for its urban density and so the public transport nightmare is hardly surprising . Packed like sardines into sweaty, claustrophobic carriages, passengers can barely breathe let alone move about freely. Indian trains are also known for their cramped conditions.

An Iron Man-style suit may soon be created to give US army troops a 'superhuman strength' on the battlefield. U.S. Special Forces Command, Adm. William McRaven has given the go-ahead for the creation of a Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (TALOS). He is calling on the technology industry, government labs and academia to help build what is being dubbed as the Iron Man suit in reference to the Marvel Comics character Tony Stark, an engineer who builds a rocket-powered suit and becomes a superhero. Vision: An Iron Man-style suit may soon be created to give US army troops a 'superhuman strength' on the battlefield. Pictured: A screenshot from the army video . Creation: U.S. Special Forces Command, Adm. William McRaven has given the go-ahead for the creation of a Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (TALOS) Specifications: The suit would be designed to enable soldiers to carry large loads as well as having layers of smart materials fitted with sensors . Speaking about the recent death of a special operator in Afghanistan he told a conference: 'I would like that last operator to be the last one we ever lose.' 'One of our folks going through the door was killed by the Taliban on . the other side in an attempt to rescue a hostage,' said McRaven. 'Why haven't we put effort into ensuring particularly that guy . going through the door ... is protected to the maximum capability that . we can provide him, as a nation?' The metal suit would be designed to enable soldiers to carry large loads - relying on tiny motors, the exoskeleton would enable a soldier to run and jump without strain. The US Army said it would also have a wearable computer similar to Google Glass, reported the BBC. The exoskeleton would be able to continuously download and display live video feeds from overhead drones. The suit has drawn comparisons Iron Man, a superhero who appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics . It would have layers of smart materials fitted with sensors and which would transmit the wearer's vital signs back to headquarters. The LA Times reports that in theory it could even staunch minor wounds with inflatable tourniquets as well have a built-in oxygen supply in case of poison gas and a cooling system. Other desired specifications are smart materials fitted with sensors to monitor body temperature, heart rate and hydration levels. Many of the technologies that could be . incorporated into McRaven’s idea of an Iron Man suit already exist. 'But . they still exist separately. So they are taking them all and they are . putting them together,' said former Navy SEAL Chris Heben to CNN.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 04:14 EST, 6 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:21 EST, 7 November 2013 . Shipbuilding in Portsmouth is to end after more than 500 years, putting hundreds of jobs at risk, it emerged today. BAE is to consult on 1,775 potential job losses, including 940 in Portsmouth and a further 835 in Glasgow, Rosyth and Filton, near Bristol. MPs and council leaders in Portsmouth reacted with fury to the decision, claiming jobs were being lost in England to protect Govan and Scotstoun on the Clyde ahead of the vote on Scottish independence. Blow: Shipbuilding in Portsmouth will come to an end after centuries of maritime history . An announcement was expected tomorrow, but was brought forward to today. Shipbuilding will come to an end at Portsmouth in the second half of next year. In a statement BAE said: 'Following detailed discussions about how best to sustain the long-term capability to deliver complex warships, BAE Systems has agreed with the UK Ministry of Defence that Glasgow would be the most effective location for the manufacture of the future Type 26 ships. 'Consequently, and subject to consultation with trade union representatives, the company proposes to consolidate its shipbuilding operations in Glasgow with investments in facilities to create a world-class capability, positioning it to deliver an affordable Type 26 programme for the Royal Navy.' In the Commons Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said that every effort would be made to redeploy workers, and that compulsory redundancies would be kept to a minimum. 'The loss of a shipmaking capability will be a harsh blow to Portsmouth,' he added as he announced that more than £100 million will be invested in the city's naval base so it can accommodate new warships. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond admitted the loss of shipbuilding would be a 'harsh blow to Portsmouth' But the announcement was attacked as a politically motivated 'act of lunacy' by one of Portsmouth's Conservative councillors. Alistair Thompson said: 'This is devastating for the workers and their families but also for all those people involved in the supply chain that keeps the dockyard working. 'Many of those who I represent as a councillor are hugely concerned that this decision has been taken for political reasons because of the referendum in Scotland next year.' Gerald Vernon-Jackson, leader of Portsmouth City Council, condemned the decision to shut down the last remaining shipyard in England with the capability to build advanced surface warships, saying it was bad news for the defence of the UK and for the Royal Navy. 'The remaining yards with the capability to build advanced warships are in Scotland, and the referendum on Scottish independence is less than one year away. Ministers have put the defence of the UK and the future of the Navy at real risk,' he said. Blow: Workers leave BAE Systems in Govan, Glasgow after hearing the defence giant is to axe 1,775 jobs across its naval ships business . The cuts are being made following a decline in orders, with 1775 jobs going between the yards in Scotland, including Govan (pictured) and England with the end of shipbuilding altogether at the Portsmouth yard . Shipbuilding work will be moved to the shipyard in Govan, where the Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier has been built . The Ministry of Defence will pick up the bill for moving the work to Scotland. BAE added: 'The implementation of these restructuring activities will sustain BAE Systems' capability to deliver complex warships for the Royal Navy and secure the employment of thousands of highly skilled employees across the UK. Workers in Portsmouth are likely to feel their jobs have been sacrificed to shore up yards in Scotland ahead of next year's independence referendum. Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: 'These are decisions taken in the UK's national interest.' Asked whether the desire to encourage Scots to vote No in next year's independence referendum had played any part in the decision, the spokesman said: 'This is a Government that always takes decisions based on the national interest. 'This decision was taken with a view of how we have the best-equipped, best-maintained Royal Navy. That is the basis on which it was taken.' He insisted Portsmouth would remain the 'home of the Royal Navy fleet' with 'world-class shipbuilding of Royal Navy ships continuing on the Clyde'. One the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers have been completed, there will not be enough orders to sustain the three yards . Livelihoods: Workers at the BAE Systems shipyard in Govan, Glasgow. As many as 1,000 jobs may be lost at three of the company's UK shipyards amid fears there will be no new work once two aircraft carriers are finished . The grim news was given to workers at a series of meetings at 11am across the affected sites, before they were allowed to go home for the rest of the day. David Hulse, GMB national officer and chair of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions' (CSEU) shipbuilding national committee, said: 'There is no doubt that this is a devastating day for the UK shipbuilding industry and the company will have justify to us the job losses planned.' Steve Murphy, general secretary of construction workers union Ucatt, said: 'Once again workers have found out that their jobs are under threat through the media. It is highly distressing and extremely unfair to treat a loyal workforce in such a way. 'This is a highly skilled workforce, so it is absolutely essential that the Government and BAE Systems minimises job losses, guarantees the long-term future of all the shipyards and continues to invest in training the workers of the future.' Some of the jobs set to be lost at the Portsmouth, Govan and Scotstoun shipyards may be offset by a contract to build a new Royal Navy carrier, the Type 26 Global Combat Ship. Hundreds of jobs are expected to be lost at Govan and Scotstoun . The MoD announced it is to commission three new ocean-going offshore patrol vessels for the Royal Navy, to be built by the BAE yards on the Clyde in Scotland. The deal provides work for the company between the completion of the current aircraft carrier contract and the start of the Type 26. The Prospect union voiced its 'deep concern' over the loss of so many skilled shipbuilding jobs and has called for an urgent meeting with ministers and the company. Deputy general secretary Garry Graham said: 'For an island nation and in this time of increased global uncertainty, we should be seeking to maintain our shipbuilding capacity, not reduce it. 'Shipbuilding is not only a key element of our defence infrastructure, it is also an industry where the UK should be a world-leader, creating and sustaining highly skilled and well-paid jobs.' What's next? A computer-generated image of the Type 26 Global Combat Ship that could keep work going . Johann Lamont, Labour's leader in . Scotland, said the referendum had created uncertainty and delayed . decisions about the future of the two yards on the Clyde. 'For me, of course, I’m not arguing . Scotland to leave the UK, I want Scotland to stay part of the UK and I . want the jobs in Portsmouth shipyard because these are highly skilled . jobs and a very effective workforce and as defence workers in my . constituency have highlighted to me, they’re concerned of the . uncertainty the referendum has brought about. 'That’s why there’s a delay about this. We don’t want to see the workforce across the United Kingdom set against another. 'And in fact, the power and strength . of the United Kingdom is that we can pool resource and we can manage . these things in a different way,' she told BBC Radio 4. Vernon Coaker MP, Labour’s shadow defence secretary, said: ‘There will be huge anxiety amongst the highly skilled workforce, their families and the communities they live in. ‘This has significant consequences for the future of shipbuilding in the UK and has implications for the future defence of our country.’","Axe falls on Portsmouth but jobs also at risk at Govan and Scotstoun .

Professional concert pianist Laia Martin is facing up to seven years in prison if found guilty of causing 'psychological injury' and noise pollution by practicing . A professional concert pianist faces seven years in prison after her neighbour said the daily practice sessions caused 'psychiatric injury'. Sonia Bosom claims Laia Martin played the instrument eight hours a day, five days a week in the apartment below hers in Puigcerda, Spain. Despite experts saying the practice was quieter than a spoken conversation, Ms Bosom says she now suffers from a range of problems caused by the 'noise pollution'. Ms Martin, 27, is being tried along with her parents,Luis Martin and Isabel Hernandez, in the northeastern city of Gerona. Ms Bosom, who lived above the Martin family, claims she suffered noise pollution from 2003 to 2007 . The . pianist denies playing at home that often, saying she took regular . classes in other towns. She claims she mostly practiced at home on the . weekends. On Monday, the . first day of the trial, the El Pais newspaper reported that Ms Bosom . told the court she now hates pianos so much she cannot even stand to see . them in a film. The prosecution claims that years of hearing constant playing has caused her 'psychological injury.' Medical . reports showed she suffered from a variety of problems, including . insomnia, anxiety, panic attacks and gynecological problems. Ms Bosom and her family moved in 2007 and she says she has had to take time off work because of  her problems. The prosecutor said tests by local authorities found that the sound levels made by the piano were repeatedly up to 10 decibels higher than the 30-decibel limit laid down for musical instruments in the town. City authorities asked the family several times to either stop the piano playing or soundproof the room. The family told the court they carried out soundproofing work twice but the complaints continued, the newspaper reported. Nuria Blanes, an environmental scientist at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, said noise around 40 decibels 'is not very much.' Martin, father Luis Martin and mother Isabel Hernandez are being tried on noise pollution charges because former neighbour said she has suffered long term problems as a result of the pianist playing the instrument . A normal conversation produces 55-60 decibels, with noise in a bar reaching 65-70 decibels and an airplane in flight producing 110-120 decibels, she said. However, she also noted that some studies have established links to health problems such as sleep disturbances and cardiovascular disease if someone faces a constant noise level of over 40 decibels during the night. 'The norm is for 30 decibels as a nighttime limit inside a house, but some authorities are widening it to daytime, which is surprising,' said Fernando Simon Yarza, a constitutional law professor at Navarra University. He said that may be due to the high fines that courts have forced some towns to pay for not taking action against excessive noise levels. 'Protection against noise and environmental quality is considered a human right,' he said. The prosecutors have asked for all three defendants to be sentenced to six years in jail for noise pollution and an additional one-and-a-half years for psychological damage. They have also demanded that all three be prohibited from playing the piano professionally for four years. A Catalonia Justice Tribunal spokeswoman said the trial will end November 15 with the verdict issued at a later date.","Sonia Bosom claims she suffers insomnia and anxiety from Laia Martin practicing the piano for up to eight hours a day .

A wedding planner at the renowned Wentworth Golf Club stole almost £11,000 in deposits from couples hoping to get married at the luxury venue. Patricia Glancy, ‘lied her head off’, cheating brides and grooms-to-be out of their costly holding fees by transferring them into her own bank account. The 36-year-old from Ascot, Berkshire said that she stole the money to support cancer charities - a claim the judge said he thought was a lie. Glancy claimed she had started stealing money from the happy couples when she was forced to call off her own wedding after discovering her fiancé had been unfaithful and got one of his many lovers pregnant. Glancy, who goes by the name Lee, defrauded five couples of nearly £10,800 between March 1 and June 6 this year - before complaining about being bullied and resigning from her job at the club. She arranged the transfer of one payment to her account and told four other couples she would stamp their cheques with the club details - only to then insert her own. Glancy was employed in the role of sales events manager at Wentworth, in picturesque Virginia Water, Surrey between January 16, 2012 and May 31, 2013. The club is the centre of the golfing world every year when it plays host to the PGA championship on its manicured greens. The couples had been hoping to get married at the renowned Wentworth Golf Club in Virginia Water, Surrey . Guildford Crown Court heard how a close friend of Glancy’s was dying of cancer and Glancy herself had lost three family members to the disease so she had wanted to financially support her friend and cancer charities. Trina Little, prosecuting, said the first of five misdirected payments, which ranged between £1,200 and £2.650, had been made by bank transfer but instead of giving the club’s details to the couple, she gave her own. The wedding planner, 36, defrauded five couples between March 1 and June 6 this year . In the other four cases Glancy asked customers for cheques - telling them to leave the payee’s name blank - and she would stamp them with the Wentworth Golf Club stamp. But she filled in her own name instead. The problem only came to light when when bride-to-be Lisa Patel tried to send Glancy an email about her booking and a message bounced back saying she had left the club. Wentworth began an investigation into the activities of Glancy, but they could not find the files as the fraudster had taken them with her when she resigned. In August after consulting her lawyers, Glancy went to a police station and confessed to her crimes. She was charged with five counts of committing fraud by false representation, which she admitted. Miss Little said Glancy had told police she was extremely sorry for her actions and that her friend Thelma Harte had terminal cancer and the money was given to a cancer charity and ‘to make some of her wishes come true’. Robert Spencer-Bernard, mitigating, confirmed Miss Harte had died and referred to the order of service from her funeral, at which Glancy spoke. in which the deceased’s children thanked those who had helped realise her dream of visiting Canada. He added that Glancy had also lost her uncle, grandmother and her sister to breast cancer. Mr Spencer-Bernard said she had also been jilted by her fiance who ‘had been unfaithful with a number of women and one of them was pregnant by him.’ ‘That is the background as to why, at the age of 36, she does something wholly, utterly out of character.’ Judge Peter Moss deferred passing sentence but told Glancy that he thought she was lying. Glancy claimed she had started stealing money from the happy couples when she was forced to call off her own wedding after discovering her fiance had been unfaithful. Above, Glancy's home in Devenish Road, Ascot . He said to the defence: ‘Your client has committed a grave fraud, a sustained fraud. She has the propensity to be dishonest. ‘I’m told she has given it to charity. There’s not a shred of evidence to support it.’ He added: ‘I’m going to be blunt - I just don’t believe her. I think I’m being sold a dummy.’ He told Glancy:‘You are perfectly capable of, and you did, sit in front of people whose wedding you were planning, and lied your head off. ‘You’re a fraudster. Why should I believe you?’ The judge said he would need to see some proof cash had been paid to charities or her dying friend. He said: ‘I suspect very strongly there is no evidence of this because it isn’t true.’ Sentence was deferred until January 30, by which time he demanded proof from Glancy as to what happened to the money and to also show that she is saving money to reimburse the club. The defrauded couples’ weddings will not be affected as Wentworth has accepted that the payments were made by them and is covering the costs.","Patricia Glancy, 36, from Ascot Berkshire, stole almost £11,000 in deposits .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 13:47 EST, 8 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:47 EST, 8 November 2013 . Rising from the ashes of 9/11, the new World Trade Center tower has punched above the New York skyline to reach its powerfully symbolic height of 1,776 feet and become the tallest building in the country. Or has it? A committee of architects recognized as the arbiters on world building heights is meeting Friday to decide whether a design change affecting the skyscraper's 408-foot needle disqualifies it from being counted. Disqualification would deny the tower the title as the nation's tallest. But there's more than bragging rights at stake; 1 World Trade Center stands as a monument to those killed in the terrorist attacks, and the ruling could dim the echo of America's founding year in the structure's height. Without the needle, the building measures 1,368 feet. Tallest towers: Willis Tower, formerly known as the Sears Tower, in Chicago on March 12, 2008 (left) and One World Trade Center in New York on September 5, 2013 (right) Topping out: The 104-floor One World Trade beats out 110-floor Willis Tower - but only if its spire is deemed admissible . What's more, the decision is being made by an organization based in Chicago, whose cultural and architectural history is embodied by the Willis - formerly Sears - Tower that would be knocked into second place by a vote in favor of the New York structure. 'Most of the time these decisions are not so controversial,' said Daniel Safarik, an architect and spokesman for the nonprofit Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. The 30 members of its Height Committee are meeting to render a judgment behind closed doors in Chicago, where the world's first skyscraper appeared in 1884. The committee, comprising industry professionals from all over the world, will announce its decision next week. To the point: A committee of architects recognized as the arbiters on world building heights is meeting in Chicago to decide whether a design change affecting One World Trade Center's needle disqualifies its hundreds of feet from being counted . The question over 1 World Trade Center, which remains under construction and is expected to open next year, arose because of a change to the design of its tower-topping needle. Under the council's current criteria, spires that are an integral part of a building's aesthetic design count; broadcast antennas that can be added and removed do not. The designers of 1 World Trade Center had intended to enclose the mast's communications gear in decorative cladding made of fiberglass and steel. But the developer removed that exterior shell from the design, saying it would be impossible to properly maintain or repair. Without it, the question is whether the mast is now primarily just a broadcast antenna. According to the architecture firm behind the building, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP, the needle will have a communications platform for radio and television equipment, but it will also be topped with an LED beacon that will fire out a horizontal blaze of light visible from 26 miles away - a feature that has been described as a crowning beacon of hope. Contention: The 110 story, 1,450-foot Willis Tower is in competition with the 104-story, 1,776-foot (including spire) One World Trade Center, a skyscraper built at the site of the 9/11 attacks . Safarik said the committee might consider amending its height criteria during the Friday meeting - a move with much broader implications that could force a reshuffle in the rankings of the tallest buildings in the world.If the matter weren't so steeped in emotion it might have set off some of the good-natured ribbing emblematic of the history of one-upmanship between New York and Chicago. But 1 World Trade Center is a monument to American resilience admired well beyond Manhattan.'I don't think anybody's going to argue with the pride in building that new tower,' said 31-year-old software developer Brett Tooley, who works across the street from the Willis Tower. 'Not only is it going to be the tallest building; it's going to be one of the strongest buildings in the history of America. It's a marvel of engineering.' From great heights: Anna Kane, five, looks down from the glass balcony called The Ledge, suspended 1,353 feet in the air and jutting four feet out from the Willis Tower's 103rd floor Skydeck . 'We take our hats off to them out here in Chicago and the Midwest,' said Robert Wislow, chairman and chief executive of U.S. Equities, the firm that manages the Willis Tower. 'And we welcome the building to the elite club of the tallest buildings in the world. Nobody's looking at this like a competition.' Still, the Willis has a central place in Chicago's history, speaking to the city's own tradition of recovering from adversity ever since the 1871 Great Fire and its history of creating architectural marvels, said Peter Alter, an archivist at the Chicago History Museum. Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, headquartered in Chicago, also designed the Willis, which opened as Sears Tower in 1973 and remained the tallest building in the world until 1996 when the council ruled that the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, had knocked it from the top spot. And the Willis can still claim to get visitors up higher: The highest occupied floor in the 1,450-foot (not including antenna height), 110-story Willis Tower is still higher up than that of the 104-story 1 World Trade Center. Rising from the ashes: One World Trade Center, built at the site of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York . At the Willis' 103rd floor thrill-seekers can step out into one of the glass boxes known as The Ledge that extend outside the building's steel frame and look straight down 1,353 feet. In New York, the debate was upsetting to Jim Riches, a retired fire department deputy chief who lost his 29-year-old firefighter son, Jimmy, in the terrorist attack. 'You know what? I think it's a ridiculous argument. It doesn't matter to me what height it is,' he said. 'You know, my son's not going to walk back in that door again. And that's the big thing. He's gone.'","Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat meet today to decide if One World Trade Center will be named tallest building in America .

Christmas just wouldn’t be Christmas without mince pies, roast turkey, crackers … and a tear-jerking advert from John Lewis. The department store has long made it its mission to convert even the most avowed Scrooges, and this year is no exception. The £7million Disney-inspired advert, which makes its TV debut tomorrow, tells the story of a selfless hare who is determined to make sure his best friend, a bear, doesn’t miss Christmas for once. Scroll down for video . I've got your back: The new John Lewis Christmas advert features a hare and a bear . So happy together: The hare and the bear enjoy autumn together . Sleepy: But as winter begins it's time for the bear to hibernate... However, it has a lot to live up to, for its predecessors have become a social media phenomenon with millions of YouTube hits and huge soundtrack sales. The commercial features the tale of two good friends, a bear and a hare, who are sad at the thought of being separated for Christmas. The store has used hand drawn animation to tell the story with the result the commercial looks very much like a classic Disney film from the 1940s, such as Bambi, which has been watched by generations of children. The technique taps in to feelings of nostalgia, while it also tells a heart-warming story which, based on past experience, will have many in tears. Looking for a place to rest: So the bear treks through the wilderness to find a likely spot... Christmas is coming: While the bear sleeps, the other woodland animals get on with decorating the tree . The tale opens as winter is starting to draw in and the fun and excitement of preparing for Christmas begins. As the first snowflake falls and lands on the bear’s nose, the hare starts to feel sad because he realises his friend will soon go off to hibernate, so – as usual - missing Christmas. While the bear is keen to join in, eventually he finds he cannot hold off his winter sleep any longer and disappears into his cave. Viewers see the bear fast asleep while all the other woodland creatures become excited about the big day to come. Sad: The hare fears that the bear is missing out, so he comes up with a bright idea . Best friends: Carrying a gift, the hare follows the bear into the wilderness where he is in hibernation . However, the hare is missing his friend and finds it increasingly difficult to join in the preparations until the moment he has a great idea for a very special present. He disappears off in to the wilderness to return with the gift – an alarm clock – which wakes the bear just in time to gather around a beautifully decorated tree to celebrate with all his friends. The commercial, which carries the strapline ‘Give someone a Christmas they’ll never forget’, is the first for the chain to use hand drawn animation. A spokesman said: ‘The story evokes the excitement of a first Christmas and the importance of friendship and thoughtfulness.’ Christmas gift: The hare leaves the bear a mystery gift - an alarm clock . Tearjerker: The alarm clock means that for the very first time the bear is awake for Christmas . The songs linked to John Lewis commercials, which generally involve a new take on much loved hits from the past, have been central to the success of its campaigns. Last year, the commercial featured a snowman’s determined trek to find his loved one a perfect gift to a version of The Power of Love by young English singer, Gabrielle Aplin. Heading for number one? Lily Allen has recorded a cover of Keane's Somewhere Only We Know for the advert . This year, Lily Allen is performing a version of the Keane’s 2004 hit ‘Somewhere Only We Know’. It is something of a coup for the singer, who stepped out of the limelight in 2010, effectively walking out on a highly successful career, to  have children. The singer and husband Sam Cooper married in Bali and had their first child Ethel Mary in November 2011, who was followed by Marnie Rose in January this year. It is known that the much missed 28-year-old has been in the recording studio working on an album to be released in the New Year. The song from the John Lewis commercial seems certain to be the perfect springboard for her come back. John Lewis has outperformed the rest of the high street since the emotive advertising series was first launched at Christmas 2009. That year, children were seen playing with gifts and morphing into adults to a folk version of the 1987 Guns N’ Roses track Sweet Child O’ Mine. The 2010 Christmas offering included a version of Elton John’s Young Song by Ellie Goulding. It subsequently topped the charts and was chosen by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as the music for their first dance as man and wife. Last year: Christmas 2012's John Lewis advert featured a snowman's trek to find the perfect gift for his loved one . Moving: 2011's ad saw Slow Moving Millie performed a version of The Smiths ¿Please, Please, Please let me get what I want¿ . Two years ago, Slow Moving Millie performed a version of The Smiths ‘Please, Please, Please let me get what I want’. Apart from building a relationship with shoppers, the campaigns have been instrumental in generating sales. One study suggested they have increased sales by more than £1billion over two years. John Lewis is investing a fortune in the latest commercial. It has bought the entire advertising break during the X-Factor tomorrow night to run a 120 second version at an estimated cost of more than £400,000.","The £7million Disney-inspired advert is to make its TV debut tomorrow .

Prince Charles has said the number of British troops being injured daily in Afghanistan - where his youngest son Harry is currently serving his second tour of duty - is 'astonishing'. The Prince of Wales said the public hears little about the number of British service personnel being wounded in Afghanistan and the 'horrific experiences' many soldiers are going through. He made the comments as he opened a £16.9 million complex at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) for wounded service personnel at Headley Court in Surrey, where green-fingered Charles enjoyed a tour of the gardens and even tried out some yoga stretches with patients.

The Prince of Wales said: 'So often people don't hear about the number of people who are wounded on a daily basis in Afghanistan. 'It is only when you visit the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (where battlefield casualties are repatriated to) or here that you realise how many people are going through such horrific experiences. It is astonishing. 'It makes me feel incredibly small and humble, what they have been through, what they go on to do and the inspiration they provide to others.' Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall toured the facility before opening the £16.9 million, 48-bed Jubilee Rehabilitation Complex, which includes therapy rooms and a gym for rehabilitation of wounded soldiers and a workshop for hi-tech prosthetic limbs.

The couple met several ex-soldiers, including some who became members of the GB Paralympic squad which achieved so much at the London 2012 Paralympic Games. They included discus thrower Derek Derenalagi, 37, who was pronounced dead when he lost both his legs following a Taliban bomb blast in Afghanistan in 2007. He survived after a medic at Camp Bastion discovered he still had a pulse. It was while he was recuperating at Headley Court that he was watching the 2008 Paralympics in Beijing, and was inspired to take part in the London games. Four years later, the former private in the Second Battalion the Mercian Regiment took his place in the Olympic Stadium to compete in the discus final at London 2012, finishing in 11th place. He said Charles had congratulated him on his achievement at the games when they spoke. 'It is great to see him and Camilla supporting injured soldiers and coming to Headley Court to see the change you can make from being injured in the frontline to getting back to normal life again,' he said. 'It is inspiring.' The royal couple also met sitting volleyball player Netra Rana, of the First Battalion Royal Gurka Rifles and Paralympic cyclist Terry Byrne, who both also benefited from the centre’s care after being wounded in Afghanistan. They were joined by Paralympic triathlete Joe Townsend, who brought the flame into the stadium for the opening ceremony and who hopes to take part in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, when his sport makes its debut. They also met representatives of several charities which work with injured personnel.

NSA leaker Edward Snowden spent two days in the Russian Consulate in Hong Kong directly before flying to Moscow on what turned out to be an abortive attempt to reach asylum in Latin America. He also marked his 30th birthday in the Russian Consulate during those days, the respected newspaper Kommersant reported today citing unidentified sources in Snowden's circle and the Russian government. If true, this would suggest greater Russian involvement in Snowden's efforts to escape American justice than President Vladimir Putin's government has acknowledged. Edward Snowden (pictured) spent two days in the Russian Consulate in Hong Kong directly before flying to Moscow . The newspaper also reported that Cuba was instrumental in blocking Snowden's further travels. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor who leaked information about the scope of U.S. government surveillance, flew to Moscow on June 23, with a ticket that would take him on to Cuba the following day. From there he could travel to countries willing to offer him asylum, including Bolivia and Venezuela. But he did not board the flight to Havana and remained in limbo until being granted asylum in Russia on Aug. 1. Kommersant, citing a Russian government official, reported that Snowden appeared at the Russian Consulate in Hong Kong on his own initiative two days before the flight, showed his Aeroflot ticket and asked for help. Two days after Snowden landed in Moscow, Putin said that his choice of travel route and his request for Russia's help had come as a 'complete surprise'. Edward Snowden Spent His 31st Birthday In The Russian Consulate In Hong Kong (pictured) This was interpreted at the time as referring to his arrival in Moscow, but Putin did not specify. On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and the U.S. Embassy in Moscow said it would have no immediate comment. The newspaper, citing several 'informed' sources, said that Cuba informed Russia that the Aeroflot flight from Moscow would not be allowed to land in Havana if Snowden were on board, citing pressure from the United States. A source identified as someone 'close to the State Department' confirmed to the paper that Cuba was among a number of countries that had been warned not to provide assistance to Snowden. Snowden has not been seen in public since arriving at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. Between his arrival on June 23 and being granted asylum nearly six weeks later, the Russian government said Snowden was limited to the airport's transit zone. He held a closed meeting in the airport with representatives of human rights groups in mid-July. After he was granted asylum, he was allowed to leave the airport, but there have been no reports of where he's staying.","It was also reported that Cuba was instrumental in blocking Snowden's further travels too .

Rising tennis star Dan Evans found out just how hard on the body competing at the top level can be - after needing to call on a physio mid game to tape up his sore nipples. The British player, 23, suffered agonising nipple rash during his second round US Open clash with Australia's Bernard Tomic. And, in what could be a first for tennis, interrupted play while his trainer tended to his unusual injury - in full view of a packed crowd. Chafing: Dan Evans grimaces in agony, left, but looks a little more comfortable, right, after having tape, seen under his shirt, put on his nipples during his second round US Open match . Getting treatment: Dan Evans called on his physio at the beginning of the 4th set in NY open match against Bernard Tomic to help perform the delicate task of taping up his chafing nipples . The incident certainly seemed to amuse Andy Murray, who tweeted: 'Great nipples from . @Evo151216 never once seen that on a tennis court... Got the physio on . due to nipple rash...' The British qualifier, from Birmingham, went on to tell his twitter followers that he was in 'agony'. But he did not allow the injury to stop his remarkable run at the US Open. The crowd favourite nipped a potential Tomic . fightback in the bud by retrieving an immediate break at the start of . the third, winning four games in a row. Sympathy: Andy Murray tweeted that he have never seen play interrupted while a player had a physio tend to their sore nipples . No pain, no gain: Dan Evans tweets that his nipple rash that caused his US Open game to be temporarily halted while he received treatment was 'agony' Amused: Andy Murray saw the funny side of fellow Britain Dan Evans' injury and tweeted 'nice nipples' after seeing the unusual drama unfold on the court . After dumping out 11th seed Kei Nishikori in round one, Evans followed up with a 1-6 6-3 7-6 (7/4) 6-3 win over his fellow tennis wild child that in some ways was even more impressive. The victory gets Evans, ranked number three in the country, around £60,000 - almost half his career earnings so far - and, perhaps even more importantly, 90 ranking points. It has been some week for Evans, who on Wednesday was invited to practise with Roger Federer - a potential fourth-round opponent. Game, set and match: After being patched up by his physio, British qualifier Dan Evans, right, went on to beat Bernard Tomic, left . Federer is coached by Paul Annacone, who used to work for the Lawn Tennis Association, and the Swiss said: 'It was the first time I really got to meet him or play with him. 'Now I have an idea how he plays, which I guess is not a bad thing. I think we were really just trying to help each other out on a rainy day trying to get a hit in. I thought he played really nice, he's got a great shot. 'I'm still a little bit surprised he beat Tomic, because we know what Bernard can do. But great effort for him. Sore point: British tennis player Dan Evans, pictured warming up before the match, suffered agonising nipple rash during his US Open game at Flushing Meadows, New York . 'To be in a third round of a slam is a huge opportunity. It doesn't get easier from here, but it should give him a ton of confidence. And it's great for Britain, no doubt about it.' The world number 179 had been nerveless in round one but could not get into the match at all in the first set, spraying his forehand and serving three double faults. The second set was where the match turned, although it did not look that way when he was broken for a third time in the match to trail 2-1. But he broke back immediately and made it three games in a row with a second break, set up by a characteristically excellent volley. Neither player was serving well, but Evans did not panic when Tomic battled back to 4-3 and forged ahead again. All smiles: Dan Evans overcame his nipple rash to beat Australian Bernard Tomic to progress to the third round of the US Open . He betrayed a few nerves when he doubled-faulted on his first set point, and two more came and went, but Evans took his fourth chance when Tomic put a backhand wide. The 23-year-old from Birmingham is not short of confidence having won 12 of his previous 14 matches, reaching back-to-back Challenger finals. The pair exchanged breaks at the start of the third and, although it went with serve from then until the tie-break, it was Evans who was pushing the pace. His forehand had been a little wayward but it was a shot Tomic struggled to deal with when Evans got it right, and it would become the key weapon of the match. Evans is a confident character and seems largely immune to the tightness that usually invades a player's arm at big moments. He played a superb tie-break, bossing world number 52 Tomic and forging into a 6-3 lead. The Australian saved one set point but Evans powered away another forehand winner - he hit 20 during the match - to clinch the second. Tomic has been accused of throwing in the towel in previous matches, including against Andy Roddick here last year, and he began to look dejected as the match slipped away. Evans simply gave him no way back in, serving two aces in a row to bring up three match points. He double-faulted on the first but his serve did the job on the second to earn him a third-round date with either 19th seed Tommy Robredo or Frank Dancevic of Canada.","Dan Evans suffered agonising nipple rash during second round match .

The death of a 16-year-old girl whose body was found in a bush has been ruled an accident causes by drugs, according to the state medical examiner’s office. Emylee Lonczak was reported missing August 21 from her home in an affluent area of McLean, Virginia. Two days later, her body turned up in the bushes between a pair of million-dollar homes in the well-heeled suburb of Vienna. Today it was reported her death was caused by the adverse effects of heroin and an over-the-counter antihistamine. According to a search warrant obtained by The Washington Post, the McLean High School student left home August 21 with two men and then drove out of state to buy drugs from another man. Members of the group then used the drug, before returning to Fairfax County in the early hours of August 22 after realizing the teen was in medical distress, but did not seek help, the document stated. No charges have been filed in the case. Police investigating Lonczak's death had previously interviewed one of the teen's companions, identified by NBC Washington as 19-year-old Kyle Alifom, and searched his parents' Vienna home .

Alifom, . who attends Marshall High School, reportedly told officials that hours . before the girl died, he and Emylee attended a party together where they . drank beer and smoked marijuana. Alifom later got a ride with the girl to his home in Vienna, where Lonczak remained for several hours before taking her leave on foot. On August 23, police bloodhounds picked up Emylee's scent in the Tysons Corner area of Vienna, and quickly tracked down her body left in the shrubbery between two homes. According to online records, Alifom has had at least two run-ins with the law. Most recently, he was arrested in March on a public drunkenness charge. A year before, Alifom was collared on a count of alcohol possession. Grieving family: Emylee, pictured as a young girl with her father Don, is survived by her parents and six brothers and sisters .

Three brothers who were torn apart when two were shipped to Australia as part of the child migrant scheme in seventies have been reunited in Britain - 43 years after the last time they were all together. Rex, Bruce and Kevin Wilton were separated as children after being taken into care following the death of their father. However as authorities decided the care for unwanted children had become too expensive, the boys, like thousands of others, were offered the chance of a 'better' life abroad. Scroll down for video . Kevin (left), Rex (centre) and Bruce Wilton (right) have been reunited after 43 years apart . Kevin, Bruce and Rex as children in their Cornwall home. Bruce was just seven when the boys were taken into care by a foster family in the UK . While the eldest brother Bruce opted to stay and work on a British pig farm instead, his younger siblings were shipped to work on farms in Australia where they endured 'mental and physical abuse'. The boys lost touch shortly after their departure, and went decades without a hint of each other's whereabouts. But, with the help of the Child Migrant Trust, the family from Mevagissey in Cornwall have been able to reunite in the UK. Father-of-three Bruce said: 'It was very emotional. 'It was great for my kids and family to meet them. It's still sinking in that we're finally together as a three.' The boys lived together with a foster family before being asked if they'd like to go to Australia, described to them in school as 'the land of opportunity' Kevin and Rex Wilton at their childhood home in Cornwall in the 1960s. The pair hadn't seen each other for 21 years before last week . Rex and Kevin Wilton recall suffering mental and physical abuse during their time in Tasmania where thousands of children were sent to work as part of the scheme . The boys boarded the last deportee plane to Australia from Britain in 1970 - three years after the child migrant programme was scrapped . The boys were taken into care in when Bruce was seven after their father, who had 'walked out' on them and their mother, in Cornwall. After living together in foster homes for seven years, they were offered the chance to go to Australia in a school assembly announcement. Bruce chose to stay in the UK while his younger siblings boarded the very last deportee plane in December 1970. The oldest of the brothers told Mail Online: 'I remember, later, I regretted not going.' 'As I got older every time I saw a book or a poster about Australia it reminded me I had lost my brothers. 'We were told it was the land of opportunity. But, now, hearing what happened to them out there, I'm glad I didn't go,' he said. Younger brothers Rex and Kevin were sent to Tasmania where they worked on farms together for several years before being separated. When asked what kind of treatment they endured, their older brother simply said: 'Slave labour'. 'There were hundreds of them out there, hundreds,' Bruce added. The boy's mother, Marina Violet Wade, put them into care as she felt she couldn't cope following their father's death . Rex, who was just 11 when sent overseas said: 'The whole experience ruined my life. We were treated like slaves. It was wrong and should never have happened. 'The care home was brutal - if the grass wasn't cut in a certain way you'd be punished for it and he'd throw things at you like a stone or a shovel until it was done right.' 'I believe that all our choices, by being in Australia, were taken away from us.' Disillusioned with the country he'd been sent to in the hope of a better life, Rex returned to the UK in his 20s after selling all of his possessions to buy a ticket. His search for older brother Bruce took a fortuitous turn one day while on he was on a train to Plymouth. Bruce, 57, recalls how his younger brother 'met a rather innocuous woman' who was able to track him down after the pair got chatting on the train. 'I don't know how she was able to find me,' he said, 'but she did,' adding the woman - who neither of them had ever met - happened to know where Bruce worked at the time. They were reunited and began searching for youngest brother, Kevin, though this proved a more difficult feat. 'It was just blockage after blockage after blockage - a series of dead ends,' said Bruce. 'It wasn't that we didn't want to find him it was just so difficult back then,'. But in 2010, following former Prime Minister Gordon Brown's apology to surviving migrant children, they were able to find their long-lost brother with the help of the Child Migrant Trust. 'Rex found them,' Bruce said, speaking of Kevin and his family, who were living in New South Wales at the time. After their daughters began communicating on Facebook, the men arranged Kevin's overdue return to Cornwall. Speaking of their separate lives, . Kevin, a retired miner said: 'I have such fond memories of us as young . boys and the jokes and laughter are still exactly the same. The origins of the scheme go back to 1618 when a hundred children were sent from London to Richmond, Virginia, with the final party of children arriving in Australia in 1970. It is estimated that over 130,000 children from the United Kingdom were taken away from their struggling families and shipped to Canada, New Zealand, Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia) and Australia as part of the programme which saw these vulnerable children as 'ideal immigrants'. In the post-war era, approximately 3,300 children were shipped to Australia while New Zealand, Rhodesia and Canada received a combined total of about 1,000 children. It is thought the children, often as young as three, were separated from their siblings and told their parents were dead in order for them to make a fresh start abroad. They were sent away with the expectation of a better life in a foreign land, but the reality that awaited them was one of torment and abuse. Most were enslaved to hard labour on farms in Australia and Canada, while in New Zealand children were placed with foster parents. Bruce and Kevin Wilton pictured in 1962. After finding brother Rex, Bruce tracked down their youngest sibling in New South Wales last year . Rex and Kevin Wilton pictured just four years before being sent to Tasmania in 1970. Rex was 11 while Kevin was just nine when they left Britain . In 2009  Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd apologised to the surviving migrant children in Canberra, expressing remorse for the 'absolute tragedy of childhoods lost'. Speaking to an audience of around 900, he said: 'We are sorry. 'Sorry that, as children, you were taken from your families and placed in institutions where so often you were abused. 'Sorry for the physical suffering, the emotional starvation and the cold absence of love, of tenderness, of care.' 'A turning point for shattered lives, a turning point for governments at all levels and of every political hue and colour to do all in our power to never allow this to happen again.' The following year Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a separate apology for the 'misguided' scheme. Speaking in the House of Commons the former Chancellor said: 'To all those former child migrants and their families... we are truly sorry. They were let down. 'We are sorry they were allowed to be sent away at the time when they were most vulnerable. We are sorry that instead of caring for them, this country turned its back. 'And we are sorry that the voices of these children were not always . heard, their cries for help not always heeded. 'And we are sorry that it . has taken so long for this important day to come and for the full and . unconditional apology that is justly deserved.' Mr Brown subsequently set up a £6million fund to help surviving families reunite. It was this fund that enabled the Wilton brothers to come together after being separated for 43 years. 'I never thought we would get the chance to be together as a three again. There's no way we're going to lose contact again - I've missed them . both so much.' The brothers plan to spend their time together visiting places from their childhood and introducing one another to family members . Speaking of the sequence of events that tore them apart, Kevin said: 'We were too young to realise what was really going to happen. 'When we arrived out there it was a extremely hard. 'There was both physical and mental abuse at the home. They treated you just like a number - you never had any choices. 'Myself and Rex had stayed in contact through letters but we eventually lost contact. 'They sent me from place to place but over time Australia started to feel like home and I decided to stay.' During Kevin's visit the brothers plan to introduce him to other family members and spend their time visiting places from their childhood. 'We went back to our hometown where we spent most of our childhood. It was like walking back in time. 'It was very special,' said Rex. Though Kevin is due to return to Australia next month, the men are certain not to lose touch again with - especially since their children have established communication with each other online. 'It was very sad what happened to us back in the 70s,' said Bruce. 'But you know, now we're back together it's as though we were never apart.'","Bruce, Rex and Kevin Wilton reunited in Cornwall after 43 years apart .

British industrialist John Hughes was 54 when he moved his entire family from their Welsh Valleys home to Imperial Russia . A British pioneer who created an entire city in Imperial Russia is being honoured more than 130 years after his death. Victorian Entrepreneur John Hughes travelled more than 2,000 miles from the Welsh Valleys to start a steelworks in the city, now called Donetsk. Hughs, who was born in Merthyr, Tydfil in South Wales, was 54 when he was headhunted by the Tsarist government who admired his designs for iron clad battleships. After being asked to create a steelworks for the Russian Empire, he acquired a £24,000 piece of land and brought 100 British men overseas to do the job. The product was not only the required factory, but a small city called Hughesovka in his honour. In a bid to re-write history however, communist leaders of the USSR later changed its name to Stalino. Today, with a population of almost 1million and a thriving football team, the city of Donetsk paid tribute to the man who created it. Ukranian ambassador Volodymyr Khandogiy was among many civic leaders that gathered to celebrate 200 years since the Brit's birth. 'John Hughes exported to our country his skills and inspiration. 'He . proved that the technology migrating through political frontiers can . bring remarkable positive changes, modernisation and development,' he . said. With 100 British workers in tow, Hughes acquired a £24,000 piece of land which would go on to become the fifth largest city in Ukraine . Hughes had been asked by the Tsar Government who admired his designs for iron clad battleships . The father-of-eight brought his family with him on the gruelling journey from South Wales to the Ukraine in 1946. They faced unforgiving winters, unbearably hot summers and cholera epidemics among other obstacles upon their arrival. After drawing inspiration from a Welsh valley town, Hughes developed a settlement which included tea rooms, schools, a hospital and churches on the otherwise baron land. Author Colin Thomas, who specialises in the links between Wales and . Ukraine, he said: 'I think in many ways it was the model of what Hughes . saw in his hometown. 'He wanted to create a town in which he was the top man - I think that was part of his driving ambition.' The entrepreneur died in 1889 while on a . business trip to St Petersberg. His sons then took over the business, . but were chased out of Ukraine in 1924 by the USSR. The city became formally known as . Donetsk in 1961, with city bosses dedicating years to suppressing its . capitalist roots before embracing Hughes as its founding father. Hughes is being honoured in the city with a statue nearby the Scientific Library of Donetsk Technical University . The town was named after its beloved founder yet communist USSR leaders changed its name to Stalino in 1924 . Today the city which is called Donetsk paid tribute to the man whose vision and expertise created it . British workers not only shared their industrial skills with locals, they introduced them to football for which the city is now famous . A statue of the industrialist has . been erected near the Scientific Library of Donetsk Technical . University, and a 700-capacity restaurant has been named after him. The palatial manor where he lived with his wife, Elizabeth Lewis and their eight children is however a ruin. Made famous by its champion . league team Shakhtae Donetsk, the city also has Hughes to thank for its . affiliation to football, as it was the British factory men in his . factory that introduced the sport to the area. The industrialist based plans for the city on a Welsh Valleys town and included a hospital, churches, schools and a pub in his designs . The Brits faced gruelling winters and unbearably hot summers upon their arrival at the land which was baron aside from buildings they produced . John Hughes died in 1889 while on a business trip to St Petersberg. His sons took over the business, but were later pushed out by communist forces . Mick Antoniw , a Welsh Assembly member for nearby Pontypridd, his dad was from Ukraine, and he has backed the tribute.

'I am honoured to help commemorate the . 200th anniversary of John Hughes and raise the profile of people like . him who have made an extraordinary difference internationally.

The lawyer for one of America's most notorious serial killers has asked Missouri's Supreme Court to halt his execution next week because there is a risk it could be 'excruciatingly painful'. Joseph Paul Franklin is scheduled to die by lethal injection at 12.01am on Wednesday for the sniper killing of 42-year-old Gerald Gordon . outside a suburban St. Louis synagogue in 1977. Following his arrest in 1980, Franklin told detectives that he selected the St Louis synagogue from the Yellow Pages of the telephone directory because he wanted to 'find a Jew and kill him' The neo-nazi, who had a pathological hatred of blacks and Jews, has also been convicted of killing an interracial couple in Madison, Wisconsin in 1977, two black joggers in Salt Lake City in 1980 and bombing a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1977. Death row: Joseph Paul Franklin is scheduled to die by lethal injection at 12.01am on Wednesday for the sniper killing of 42-year-old Gerald Gordon outside a suburban St. Louis synagogue in 1977 . But his attorney, Jennifer Herndon, has claimed the use of pentobarbital from a compounding pharmacy puts him at risk of an 'excruciatingly painful execution.' Investigators believe Franklin, fueled by a hatred of blacks and Jews, committed many more crimes in several states. He has reportedly confessed to at least 21 killings, 16 bank robberies and other crimes during the late 1970s until he was caught after the Salt Lake City killings in 1980. Among his alleged crimes were two high-profile shootings — of civil rights leader Vernon Jordan in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1980, and porn baron Larry Flynt in Lawrenceville, Georgia, in 1978. Both men survived. Missouri had planned to become the first state to execute an inmate using the anesthetic propofol, until a huge outcry from the medical community. Hatred: The neo-nazi has also been convicted of killing an interracial couple in Madison, Wisconsin in 1977, two black joggers in Salt Lake City in 1980 and bombing a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1977 . Most propofol is made in Europe, and the EuropeanUnion threatened to limit exports if it was used in an execution. Gov. Jay Nixon last month halted the scheduled execution of another convicted killer, Allen Nicklasson, and ordered the Corrections Department to revise the protocol. Days later, Missouri switched its execution drug to pentobarbital. Flynt's motion claims too few details about that switch have been released to the public. He also expressed opposition to the death penalty. 'I have advocated that Franklin should spend the remainder of his life in prison rather than be killed,' Flynt wrote in the court filing. He cited his recent commentary in the Hollywood Reporter in which he wrote that the 'sole motivating factor behind the death penalty is vengeance, not justice, and I firmly believe that a government that forbids killing among its citizens should not be in the business of killing people itself.' Victim: Larry Flynt says he doesn't to see the man who shot him put to death . Flynt was standing trial on an obscenity charge in Georgia in 1978 when he was wounded by a sniper's bullet. No one was arrested at the time. Franklin was housed in federal prison in Marion, Ill., in the mid-1990s when he confessed to shooting Flynt. Gwinnett County, Ga., District Attorney Danny Porter said he is convinced Franklin shot Flynt because Franklin provided information only the shooter would know — details about the shooting location, the type of weapon used, even the maker of the gun. But Porter said he opted against filing charges because Franklin had already been convicted of multiple killings and said it didn't make sense to bring him back to Georgia for another trial. The St. Louis County synagogue shooting happened in 1977. Franklin staked out a spot nearby and waited for guests to leave a bar mitzvah. He shot and killed 42-year-old Gerald Gordon, then rode a bicycle to his waiting car and got away. He confessed in 1994, also while imprisoned in Marion, and was convicted in a 1997 trial.","Neo-nazi Joseph Paul Franklin murdered five people between 1977 and 1980 .

An extraordinary letter written by the future King Edward VIII to his first mistress in which he expresses frustration at having to go to the opera rather than see her has come to light. The 25-year-old Prince of Wales told married socialite Freda Dudley Ward of his excitement at sleeping with her and even used the F-word in the two-page note, which is expected to fetch £1,800 at auction. However, he lamented that he was forced to attend the opera with his family and would not be able to see her until late at night. Lovers: A letter from Edward VIII to Freda Dudley Ward full of gushing terms of endearment has come to light . Passion: The letter was written by Edward when he was the 25-year-old Prince of Wales in 1919 . Edward, who was known by his middle name David at the time of the 1919 letter, would later abdicate the throne in order to marry his lover, American divorcee Wallis Simpson. But his first furtive dalliance was with Mrs Dudley Ward, who was at the time trapped in a loveless marriage to a prominent MP. The couple had a five-year affair after they met while sheltering in a doorway during a zeppelin raid in the First World War. The letter, which was revealed after the collector from Birmingham who owned it died, is full of gushing terms of endearment, as well as swear words which Edward replaced with dashes. It is headed 'Buckhouse SW' - indicating that the prince wrote it from Buckingham Palace. Note: The letter was sent to Mrs Dudley Ward at her London home near Marble Arch . Together: Edward pictured with his lover and her husband, Liberal MP William Dudley Ward . It is addressed to 'my darling beloved little Fredie', and reads: 'Bless you for your two sweet little letters which have made me so so happy particularly the last one saying that you are arriving back this evening and suggesting that I shld look in after the opera. 'Oh! No I could'nt (sic) possibly do such a common thing as that - - - !!!! I am so so overjoyed at the thought of seeing my own precious darling little girl again so soon. 'I ought to be able to get round about 12.00 and I'll let myself in as I've (still) got the key! 'It's so so divine of you wanting your little David to come and you just can't think how happy you've made him belov'd one and how much it makes him love and adore you. 'I only wish I could come earlier but I'm told the - - opera can't be over before 11.30 so it can't be helped tho. I do say f- - - !!!! 'So till midnight Fredie darling darling tho it's a shame to keep you up so late tho how madly happy I am how how I'm looking forward to ""after the opera"" when I shall sleep and probably snore!!' On sale: The letter was found among the papers of a collector in Birmingham and is now going up for auction . The prince concludes by promising 'all my very great love and more kisses than I'm capable of sending my very own darling beloved precious little Fredie,' and signs off: 'Your devoted and adoring petit amoureuse David'. The letter will go under the hammer at Fellows auctioneers in Birmingham on November 25. Mark Huddleston, from Fellows, said: 'It is safe to say that Edward gets a little bit carried away in this letter. 'The letter is fascinating, as it is as if Edward had no self-censorship when writing it. He spills all his thoughts and feelings down onto paper without giving it a second thought. 'The result is a rather colourful letter that makes for quite cringy reading, peppered with terms of endearment like sweetheart and darling. 'Edward doesn't seem to be that interested in going to the opera - he makes it quite clear he would rather be cavorting with Freda. 'Edward obviously had a penchant for married women because by the early 1930s he was with Wallace Simpson and Freda's attempts to contact him were blocked. She was totally cut out of the equation. 'This letter is a fascinating piece of royal history. It is a private window into the heady relationship between the infamous Prince and his mistress in their first months together.' Playboy: Edward was known for his louche lifestyle and would later abdicate in order to marry his mistress . The prince, who was notorious for his playboy ways and string of lovers, reluctantly became king in January 1936 following the death of his father, George V. However, he abdicated in December of the same year after Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin told him he could not marry Mrs Simpson, and the throne passed to his younger brother George VI, father of the present Queen. The former King, who took the title of Duke of Windsor, went to live in Paris where he became a prominent society figure, and died in 1972. Freda Dudley Ward divorced her first husband, Liberal MP William Dudley Ward, in 1931 and married Pedro Jose Isidro Manuel Ricardo Mones, Marques de Casa Maury in 1937.

'They didn't wait a nanosecond to say, 'Of course!''

Jonathan Martin could sue the Miami Dolphins for big money under a variety of workplace laws - and could turn to his own legal eagle mother for advice. The employment legislation makes employers liable for bullying, harassment and discrimination - even if the team's hierarchy didn't know about it, according to several legal experts. The NFL's special investigator, Ted . Wells, plans to meet in New York today with Martin, who has been with his family in Los . Angeles and is receiving counseling. Dolphins owner Stephen Ross also . plans to meet at a later date with Martin. Interestingly, Martin's . mother, Jane Howard-Martin, spent almost 20 years practicing employment . law and wrote numerous articles in legal journals on such issues as . workplace discrimination and harassment. It's not known whether she has . any role in her son's decisions; Howard-Martin is now assistant general . counsel for Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. in Los Angeles. Scroll down for video . Player Jonathan Martin, pictured in New York today, arrives to speak with the NFL investigator over claims he was bullied at the Miami Dolphins . Jonathan Martin arrived at the office of the NFL lawyer investigating the team's bullying scandal on Friday. The league is trying to gather information about the harassment Martin says he was subjected to by teammate Richie Incognito. Martin and a companion arrived at lawyer Ted Wells' Manhattan office building and were met by a crush of reporters. The offensive lineman smiled but did not respond to questions while entering the building. Suing the Dolphins could be more . successful than bringing criminal charges against offensive lineman . Richie Incognito, who was suspended by the Dolphins after fellow lineman . Martin left the team two and a half weeks ago. Martin's attorney, David Cornwell, says Martin was repeatedly harassed . by Incognito and others in ways that 'went far beyond the traditional . locker room hazing'. Miami Dolphins Tackle Jonathan Martin left the team over allegations of bullying . For Martin to win a lawsuit, Nova Southeastern University law professor Bob Jarvis said he'd have to show precisely that. 'It . will be crucial for Martin to convince a jury that even with a rough . workplace, there is a line that cannot be crossed and it was crossed . here,' Jarvis said. One path for Martin to take would be filing a grievance with the NFL players union or a complaint with the NFL itself. Aside . from that, legal experts say there are several avenues he could take to . sue the Dolphins. Cornwell did not respond to an email asking for . additional comment on any of these options. Two labor-employment lawyers at Venable . LLP in New York, Michael Volpe and Nicholas Reiter, said in a written . analysis of the Martin matter that employers can face lawsuits related . to bullying if the harassment involved a victim's race, religion, sexual . orientation or disability. Richie Incognito is accused of bullying his teammate Jonathan Martin . Claims can be made for harassment, infliction of emotional distress and negligent supervision. One voicemail that has surfaced from Incognito to Martin, who is black, included a racial slur and other Dolphins players have said use of the slur in the locker room was not out of the ordinary. In addition, Volpe and Reiter said that Martin could claim that he was essentially forced to leave the Dolphins because of workplace harassment. 'Even if the Dolphins were unaware of Incognito's alleged behavior, which may be the case, the organization could still face claims of liability,' they said. There have also been reports that Incognito was told by coaches to 'toughen up' Martin, which could show the team did have knowledge about the harassment, the two lawyers said. Still, it's no slam dunk for Martin. For example, one allegation is that Martin forked over $15,000 for veteran Dolphins teammates to take a trip to Las Vegas that he did not attend. That could be viewed in court as being a willing participant and make a harassment lawsuit harder to prove. If, Jarvis said: 'Martin seemed to be going along with the conduct willingly, then Martin cannot now change his mind and decide that he didn't want to be part of the culture.' For Incognito himself, the main issue would likely be his future NFL playing career. The NFL players' union announced Thursday that Incognito has filed a grievance over his indefinite suspension by the Dolphins. The union statement says that Incognito is requesting an expedited hearing so he can resume playing football immediately. Tamara Lave, a law professor at the University of Miami, said the current national focus on bullying and hazing in schools and at the workplace would figure in Martin's favor should he take legal action. Especially, she said, because he is a physically imposing NFL player — 6-foot-5, 312 pounds — who is typically perceived as having few weaknesses. 'The fact that you have a 300-pound man who feels so threatened and uncomfortable that he leaves, that's an indication of how serious it was,' Lave said. From the criminal standpoint, former prosecutor David S. Weinstein said it's possible but not likely that Incognito could be charged with extortion if he made threats to force Martin to pay the $15,000 for the Vegas trip. Another option would be written threats to do bodily harm, based on Incognito's texts to Martin making threats about his mother. 'However, I don't really see the (state prosecutors) going after Incognito, but I could be wrong,' Weinstein said. Florida does have an anti-hazing law, but Jarvis said it applies only to educational institutions and not adult workplaces.","NFL special investigator, Ted .

The wife of a GP has been arrested by police on suspicion of murder after her doctor husband was stabbed to death at their £700,000 home. Gary Hughes, 60, was found dead in the coastal village of Feock, Cornwall, at 7.40am today and his wife Marion is believed to have been held by police. Officers said they found the body of a man with stab wounds to the chest and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. Mrs Hughes also suffered injuries and was taken to hospital but police said her wounds were not life threatening. Mr Hughes was a GP in the Camborne and Redruth area of Cornwall. Detective Inspector Ben Beckerleg of Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'This is the beginning of an investigation. 'But early indications suggest this was a domestic incident and no-one else is being sought at this time. 'An investigation had now begun to fully understand the circumstances and events leading up to this man's death.' Neighbour, Chris Young, said: 'When it comes so close to your doorstep it is very worrying. This is a very quiet area with very few passers-by.'

Scientists have found new evidence that suggests the earliest fully modern humans arrived in the Near East (now known as the Middle East) around 42,000-years-ago. An international team of researchers radiocarbon dated marine shells found at a key archaeological site in Lebanon, which allowed them to calculate the oldest fossil from the same sequence of archaeological layers is between 42,400 and 41,700-years-old. The shell beads found at Ksar Akil are significant as they are roughly the same age as the earliest fossils of modern humans found in Europe, which enables scientists to explore 'intriguing new possibilities' about the routes taken by the earliest modern humans out of Africa. Beads from the site of Ksar Akil, Lebanon, found closely associated with the skeleton of an early modern girl dating to between 39,000 to 41,000 years ago. The beads (pictured) are made of shells of small marine snails as well as a Glycymeris shell in the centre, preserved with bright red pigmentation . The team, led by the University of Oxford, radiocarbon dated 20 marine shells from the top 15 metres of archaeological layers at Ksar Akil, north of Beirut. The shells were perforated, which indicates they were used as beads for body or clothes decoration by modern humans. Neanderthals, who were living in the same region before them, were not making such beads, according to the scientists. The study, published in journal PLOS ONE, confirms that the shell beads . are only linked to the parts of the sequence assigned to modern humans . and shows that through direct radiocarbon dating they are between . 41,000-35,000 years old. Scientists radiocarbon dated 20 marine shells from the top 15 metres of archaeological layers at Ksar Akil, north of Beirut in Lebanon . Scientists and historians consider . the Middle East to be a key region in prehistory and academics have long . speculated about the routes taken by early humans out of Africa because it lies at the crossroads of three continents – Africa, Asia and Europe. It was widely believed that at some point around 45,000 years ago, early modern humans arrived in Europe, taking routes out of Africa through the Near East and from there travelled along the Mediterranean rim or the River Danube. However, this dating evidence suggests populations of early modern humans arrived in Europe and the Near East at roughly the same time, sparking a new debate about where the first populations of early humans travelled from in their expansion towards Europe and which alternative routes they may have taken. Several human remains were found in the Lebanese rock shelter in Ksar Akil when it was first excavated 75 years ago. But sadly, the most complete skeleton of a young girl thought to be between seven and nine-years-old, who was buried at the back of the shelter, has disappeared. Fragments of a second individual found next to the girl have also been lost. However, the team was able to calculate the age of the lost fossil at 40,800 to 39,200 years old, taking into account its location in the sequence of archaeological layers in relation to the marine shell beads. Another fossil of a recently rediscovered fragment of an upper jaw of a woman, now located in a museum in Beirut, had insufficient collagen to be dated by radiocarbon methods. But a method using statistical modelling was used to date by association the jaw fragment at 42,400 to 41,700 years old. The excavations at Ksar Akil in 1938 showing workers digging at 17 metres below the surface. A chief archaeologist examines their finds from above (shown here in the middle right of the picture wearing a hat) Ksar Akil is one of the most important Palaeolithic sites in Eurasia and consists of a 23 metre deep sequence of archaeological layers that have been undisturbed for thousands of years until a team of American Jesuit priests excavated a rock shelter in 1937 and revisited it 10 years later. The cave layers were found to contain the human fossils and hundreds of shell beads, as well as thousands of stone tools and broken bones of hunted and consumed animals. Study lead author Dr Katerina Douka, from the School of Archaeology at the University of Oxford, said: ‘This is a region where scholars have been expecting to find early evidence of anatomically and behaviourally modern humans, like us, leaving Africa and directly replacing Eurasian Neanderthal populations that lived there for more than 150,000 years. It was believed early modern humans arrived in Europe 45,000 years ago, taking routes out of Africa through the Near East, and then along the Mediterranean rim or the River Danube (pictured in modern times). But the new evidence suggests early modern humans arrived in Europe and the Near East at roughly the same time . 'The human fossils at Ksar Akil appear to be of a similar age to fossils in other European contexts. It is possible that instead of the Near East being the single point of origin for modern humans heading for Europe, they may also have used other routes too. 'A maritime route across the Mediterranean has been proposed although evidence is scarce. A wealth of archaeological data now pinpoints the plains of Central Asia as a particularly important but relatively unknown region which requires further investigation.’ The earliest European modern fossil, from Romania, is thought to be between 42,000 and 38,000 years old and specialists have estimated the age of Kent's Cavern Maxilla from southern England, between 44,000 to 41,000 years and that of two milk teeth in southern Italy, at 45,000 to 43,000 years old. The new dating evidence from Ksar Akil is largely comparable to these ages, if not slightly younger.","The University of Oxford used radiocarbon techniques to date marine shells found at Ksar Akil, Lebanon which allowed them to date human remains .

A former Royal Marine Commando has broken his own record for Britain's deepest ever freedive. In a competition in the Bahamas, Michael Board, 42, swam to a depth of 328ft (100m) using only a fin on his feet for propulsion and a rope to make sure he stayed in a straight line. The dive was deeper than the height of the Elizabeth Tower, otherwise known as Big Ben, and meant Micheal held his breath for nearly three minutes. Micheal Board, 42, originally from London, has broken his own freediving record by reaching a depth of 328ft (100m) using only a fin on his feet and a rope to keep him in a straight line . During the dive Board's lungs would have been crushed to a quarter of their normal size, which made him black out on a previous attempt just a few days beforehand . During the dive Board held his breath for nearly three minutes. On land the former Green Beret can hold his breath for six minutes and 32 seconds . At that depth the air in his lungs would have become compressed, crushing them to a quarter of their normal size, which can lead to blackouts. Speaking after the event the freedive instructor said: 'The dive felt good. I was obviously apprehensive having blacked out in my previous attempt a few days before but I changed a few things for this dive, took a little less weight down, and had less pre-dive nerves. 'Not everything went right though, my nose-clip was not tight enough and I was losing air on the descent so I almost ran out of equalisation before the bottom and only just made it. 'However the ascent felt strong, the light was much better which really helped right at the end of the dive when surfacing.' The previous record, set by Micheal in January this year, was 315ft (96m). He managed to dive to 100m on that occasion but was disqualified because his nose peg fell off. The freedive instructor became interested in the sport while scuba diving and after realising he could hold his breath for longer than his friends . Micheal has actually reached 100m three times before but was disqualified when his nose peg fell off, ruptured an eardrum, and blacked out . The freedive instructor now lives in Gili Trawangan in Indonesia with his girlfriend Kate Middleton who holds the New Zealand record for Constant Weight freediving . Michael, who now runs a diving school in Indonesia with his girlfriend Kate Middleton (no relation to the Duchess), became interested in free diving while working as a scuba diving instructor. He used to get into contests with his friends to see who could hold their breath the longest and found he was quite good at it. So good, in fact, that on the surface he can hold his breath for six minutes and 32 seconds. He said: 'I wanted to do more of it and learned to become a freediving instructor. I've been doing if for four-and-a-half-years now.' The last freedive records not to be held by Michael was 298ft (91m) and held by Dave King, a geography teacher from Brighton who set it in 2009. The world record holder for free immersion diving is William Trubidge, from, New Zealand, which stands at 397ft (121m), nearly twice the height of Tower Bridge. The previous record holder before Micheal was held by Dave King, a geography teacher who set it in 2009 . The Suunto Vertical Blue freediving competition is an annual competition which takes place at Dean's Blue Hole, the world's deepest known blue hole with saltwater . The current world record for freediving stands at 121m, nearly twice the height of Tower Bridge, and was set by William Trubidge, from, New Zealand . Board's record-breaking dive was his fourth attempt at reaching the 100m mark. The Brit failed in his first attempt at last's years Suunto Vertical Blue, where he was disqualified for taking too long to complete the necessary surface protocol. His second try was this year at the world championships in Kalamata where he had trouble equalising and ruptured his eardrum, which took eight weeks to heal. His third attempt, a couple of days before his record-setting dive, saw him suffer a small blackout on the surface, before eventually succeeding with his forth. The former Green Beret says he spends most of the year in Gili Trawangan in Indonesia where he runs the Freedive Gili school with Kate, who holds the New Zealand record for Constant Weight freediving. He added: 'I have my own 25m pool there and unlimited depth but it is open water diving so conditions are not always ideal like here in the Blue Hole. 'However it does allow me to maintain dive fitness and flexibility throughout the year.'","Michael Board, 42, originally from London, broke his own record .

Brett Favre, 44-year-old NFL hall of famer, has been speaking out about the dangers of sports related head injuries, and about his 'scary' memory lapses due to on field concussions. Farve has been tackled 525 times, more than any other quarterback, and is starting to feel the negative effects on his brain. In an interview with a Washington D.C. radio station in October, the ex Green Bay Packer said that he was unable to remember an entire summer of his daughter playing youth soccer. Scroll Down For Video . Brett Farve has spoken publicaly about his frightening brain injuries and said he couldn't remember an entire summer in which his daughter played youth soccer . Head in the game: dangerous falls like this one in a game Farve played for the Minnesota Vikings may have contributed to the player's memory loss . 'I got a pretty good memory, and I have a tendency like we all do to say, 'Where are my glasses?' and they're on your head. This was pretty shocking to me that I couldn't remember my daughter playing youth soccer, just one summer,' Favre told Sports Talk 570. 'That's a little bit scary to me. For the first time in 44 years, that put a little fear in me.' Farve recently told Matt Lauer on Today News that if he were to have a son he may not want him playing the game. The interview with Lauer will air on Monday. 'I would be real leery of him playing football. In some respects , I'm almost glad I don't have a son because of the pressures he would face,' Farve told Lauer. NBC reports that the NFL recently changed some rules to protect players heads from contact during and outside of games. The NFL also supported state laws dedicated to promoting safety in youth sports. Brett Farve spent most of his career playing as a quarterback for the Green Bay Packers . New rules aside, the NFL is still one of the most dangerous work environments and players who've had injuries from the game have become suicidal due to the injury's effects on the brain. Ex-linebacker Junior Seau shot himself in the chest at his California home. An autopsy revealed that Seu suffered from a progressive degenerative brain disease called chronic encephalopathy (CTE). Players with brain injuries have reported depression, loss in memory, violent streaks, degenerative diseases, suicidal impulses, and various related health problems. Junior Seau of the New England Patriots shot himslelf in the chest and was later found to have a degenerative brain disease . Dave Duerson of the Chicago Bears shot himself in the chest and left a suicide note asking doctors to study his brain . Many head injuries have long term effects starting just after or long after retirement from the game. In fact, so many former NFL players have debilitating head injuries that many have sued the NFL for withholding information of the dangers of their injuries. The players claim that the NFL failed to tell them that their frightening symptoms were related to concussions. Thousands of players who sued the NFL reached a settlement of $765 million. Some players were so dedicated to preventing serious brain damage, that 30 former NFL players donated their brains to research. Another NFL player who commit suicide with a gunshot to the chest, Dave Deurson, left a suicide note asking experts to study his brain. Brian Mccarthy, a spokesman for the NFL issued a statement on Friday. 'For more than two decades, the NFL has been a leader in addressing the issue of head injuries in a serious way,' the statement said. 'Important steps have included major investments in independent medical research; improved medical protocols and benefits,as well as innovative partnerships with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health to accelerate progress,' McCarthy continued. It's not a secret anymore: Many NFL players, including Farve, believe that the NFL withheld important information from them regarding their head injuries . 'The players either retired or some of the few players ... are either killing themselves or self destructing. And you know, studies have proven that some of this is because of concussions,' Favre said in his radio interview. NBC talked to Dr.Richard Figler, a doctor who practices orthopedic surgery at the Cleveland Clinic Sports Health Center. He was troubled by Farve's lapses in memory. 'It made me sad to hear him say that, but also … it raises the awareness, especially among high school football players who have sustained concussions but may not understand the symptoms, Figler said. Figler also said that some students don't take concussions seriously at first, but the weeks later are getting Fs on their exams. This can cause even more injury over time. 'When you play with a brain injury, it probably means that there's a buildup of these injuries over time, and I think it's safe to say the effects that we're seeing now (with retired NFL players) – it’s a cause and effect,' Figler said. undereducated coaches may allow a player to return to the game when he is not yet fully healed.This can cause problems later in life. 'The question is: How do we reduce the risk of the injury? And that's with education, the recognition of the symptoms, the athlete being smart enough to pull themselves off the field when they do have these symptoms, and making sure they're back to as normal as they can be before they go back to that activity,' continued Figler. NBC reports that one team tried to convince Favre to continue playing but that he refused. Brett Favre turned down the offer and will continue coaching high school football in Mississippi.

Jailed: IT worker Robert Weir, 37, has been jailed for 12 years for the sexual assault and rape of a child . A rapist has been jailed after his 12-year-old victim found the courage to tell police because she watched a sex attack storyline on television drama The Bill. Robert Weir, 37, was arrested after the girl broke down as she watched the show with her mum and revealed the full extent of his crime. Weir, an IT worker from Preston, Lancashire, had earlier pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting the child but was put on trial for the more serious charges. Today he was sentenced to 12 years in jail after a jury found him guilty of rape and sexual assault. The offences first came to light after the girl's parents discovered text messages from Weir on her mobile phone, Preston Crown Court heard. She told them Weir had sexually assaulted her and the police were called. But the girl made further allegations when she watched the story of a teenaged rape victim  on ITV's The Bill. Her mother asked if she would like to change the channel but instead the girl left the room and locked herself in the bathroom, where her mother found her 'sobbing her heart out'. She told her mum she had not told her everything that had happened with Weir and went on to say he had raped her. The child, who can not be identified for legal reasons, told the court she was 'ashamed and disgusted' about what had happened and feared her family would hate her if they found out. The court heard that Weir groomed the victim over a period of time prior to committing the offences in 2012. Sentencing Weir, Judge Altham: 'This case concerns you sexually exploiting a young girl, she was 12, she hadn't yet reached her 13th birthday. Courage: The court heard the girl found the courage to tell her mother after watching an episode of The Bill . 'She was a girl who had and has her own problems. You sexually exploited her. I repeat she was 12 at the time. 'The complainant was already a troubled young lady but this made things worse by what you did, it is hardly surprising she is now wrestling with demons you leased into her life. 'She expressed a feeling of guilt and shame that she repeated. She has nothing to feel ashamed about but one understands why these feelings arise in a young girl. 'It is not surprising that she is self harming, it is not surprising that her education is being disrupted, her relationship between her and her mother is even more difficult, which is all to be expected when a child has been raped. 'This is an offence for which a custodial sentence is inevitable and it is an immediate custodial sentence. It is a particularly grave offence.' 'Demons': The judge at Preston Crown Court berated Weir for 'leasing demons into her life' Detective Sergeant Steve Ryder said: 'I am pleased with the jury's decision to find Weir guilty of these offences and the lengthy sentence that has been given. 'I would like to reassure the community of Preston that offences of this type are uncommon and we will always do what we can to bring offenders to justice. 'As with all reports of sexual offences, specially trained officers have been working closely with the victim in this case and we have provided the appropriate support through our partner agencies.' Weir was also put on the sex offenders' register for life.","Robert Weir was jailed for 12 years and put on the sex offenders list .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 07:17 EST, 1 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:29 EST, 1 November 2013 . The BBC has apologised over a controversial joke which suggested Prince Harry takes cocaine - but only for getting the name of a friend of the Royals wrong in the gag. Comedian Jo Brand said on Have I Got News for You: 'George's godparents include Hugh van Cutsem - I presume that’s a nickname as in Hugh van cuts 'em and Harry then snorts 'em.' In fact, Prince George's godfather is William van Cutsem, whose brother and late father are both called Hugh, and the BBC has now apologised to Clarence House for the error. Controversy: Jo Brand, left, made a joke on Have I Got News for You which implied that Prince Harry took drugs . However, the corporation has stood by the satirical suggestion that Harry takes drugs, saying that it was 'clearly tongue-in-cheek'. The joke was made on last Friday's edition of the comedy news quiz by Ms Brand, a member of the anti-monarchist organisation Republic. Panellists were discussing the christening of Prince George when she made the quip, which was written by producers and appeared on the host's autocue. There is no evidence that Prince Harry, a serving Army officer, has ever taken Class A drugs, although he is said to have smoked cannabis as a teenager. Error: Ms Brand also referred to Prince George's godfather William van Cutsem, pictured with his wife Rosie, as 'Hugh', the name of hsi brother and late father . The error about Mr van Cutsem's name added to the outrage expressed by many viewers. It was considered particularly insensitive as the elder Hugh van Cutsem, a close friend of Prince Charles, died just two months ago. The BBC wrote to Kensington Palace apologising for the mistake after Royal aides apparently contacted the corporation to complain. A BBC spokesman said: 'We apologise for the factual inaccuracy in last Friday's programme and have edited iPlayer and future repeats accordingly.' Shock: Fellow panellist Ian Hislop asked, 'Have we lost the lawyers?' after Ms Brand's joke . Honourable: The fourth in line to the throne has served on two tours of duty to Afghanistan as an Apache pilot . But the corporation has refused to budge from its previous argument that the drug reference was nothing more than a joke which should not be considered offensive. 'Have I Got News For You is a satirical news quiz and the audience is used to the often irreverent humour,' a spokesman said this week. 'This was clearly a tongue-in-cheek comment.' Ms Brand, 56, also said she would not apologise, pointing out that she did not write the joke but adding: 'I thought it was funny. I don’t really understand what the fuss is about.' After she made the crack, fellow panellist Paul Merton looked shocked, while Ian Hislop said: 'Have we lost the lawyers?' Lord Dannatt, former head of the Army, later said that the suggestion was 'outrageous' and 'most inappropriate'. Defence minister Anna Soubry added: 'That is disgraceful, shoddy, appalling and out of order. Prince Harry does an outstanding job in the Army and always goes the extra mile to help wounded service personnel and veterans.'","Jo Brand implied that Harry 'snorts' cocaine on Have I Got News for You .

"By . Claire Elliott . PUBLISHED: . 21:01 EST, 3 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:15 EST, 4 November 2013 . Aged only 60 minutes, Keira Robertson had suffered more than most people do in a lifetime. Not only had her heart stopped beating for 25 minutes, she then needed surgery as doctors battled to save her. Her parents, Michaela and Christopher, had earlier been warned she was unlikely to survive beyond 21 weeks in the womb. They were told that as well as having four major heart defects, their unborn child had a high risk of cystic fibrosis and Down’s syndrome. Survivor: Miracle baby Keira Robertson, aged seven-months, from Brechin, Angus, died for 25 minutes before she was revived by doctors and underwent life-saving heart surgery - all before she was an hour old . In hospital: Keira Robertson was just nine minutes old when her heart stopped beating. Doctors worked for 25 minuted until they finally revived her . Despite the warnings, Mrs Robertson, from Brechin, Angus, rejected advice to terminate her pregnancy and when Keira was delivered ‘pink and screaming’ a week early, the couple could not have been happier. However, only nine minutes later Keira’s heart stopped. When doctors finally managed to revive her, she needed two heart operations – after 40 minutes of life and at eight days old – and a week of hypothermia treatment to reverse any brain damage. But having survived her gruelling start to life, Keira is a happy, smiling seven-month-old baby and taking on her next challenge – learning to crawl. Mrs Robertson, 23, said: ‘She’s amazing, She’s doing everything she should be doing for a seven-month-old. She’s sitting up and rolling, quicker than her brothers did. And she doesn’t have Down’s syndrome or cystic fibrosis. ‘At my 20-week scan they gave me three weeks to decide whether to continue with the pregnancy. ‘They said she wouldn’t make it past 21 weeks in the womb. But I wasn’t giving up on her, I decided to carry on. ‘Every week were told the pros and cons but I ignored it, I knew she’d be OK. And she’s proved them all wrong.’ Through . a routine scan half-way through her pregnancy Mrs Robertson – who is . also mother to Kaiden, four, and Bayley, two – discovered that Keira’s . arteries were transposed. She also had two holes in her heart and . narrowing of the pulmonary valves. Traumatic: Once doctors revived Keira, she needed to immediately undergo emergency heart surgery . Worth the wait: Michaela, pictured left, and her husband Christopher, pictured right, finally got to hold Keira when she was two weeks old . The combination of these problems meant there was limited blood being pumped around her body or to the lungs. For the remainder of her pregnancy Mrs Robertson received growth scans and was told that Keira would weigh only about 4lb at birth. Her delivery by caesarean section at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow on March 28 took more than two hours because of Keira’s position. Mrs Robertson said: ‘The surgeon actually lifted me off the operating table with the force needed to pull the baby out.’ But when Keira finally arrived she weighed in at a healthy 8lb 5oz. The plan was to transfer her to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Yorkhill, Glasgow, within 24 hours. Lucky to be alive: Doctors had believed it was unlikely Keira would survive beyond 21 weeks in the womb . Mrs Robertson recalled: ‘When she came out she was pink and was screaming, but at nine minutes old her heart stopped and she passed away for 25 minutes. ‘The doctors came down and told us that things weren’t looking too good and she probably won’t make it. ‘I just sat there in shock. My mum and my husband sat there crying, but I just didn’t register what they were saying.’ Doctors massaged the newborn’s heart to try to keep the blood pumping and she was given five doses of adrenaline to re-start it. Just as medics were on the verge of giving up, Keira’s heart began to beat a minute after the final attempt to resuscitate her. Mrs Robertson said: ‘They had been trying for so long that they said it would have been better to let her go. ‘But after 24 minutes they gave it one last attempt and she pulled through.’ Minutes later, when she was only 40 minutes old, doctors carried out an emergency operation to keep the arteries in her heart open. Her body temperature was cooled to 24c (75f) in an attempt to reverse any brain damage as it had been starved of oxygen for so long. At eight days old she had a ten-hour open heart operation to correct her arteries, two holes in her heart and widen the pulmonary valves. Her body temperature was gradually brought back up to the normal body temperature of 37c (98.6f).Mrs Robertson said: ‘After the operation we finally got to see her, although nothing prepared us for seeing our poor girl’s chest wounds and dressings. ‘But a few days later she opened her eyes for the first time, aged two weeks, and I finally got to hold her.  It was such an emotional day.’ Proud family: Mother Michaela with baby Keira and her brothers Kaiden, four, pictured right, and Bayley, two . Despite all that happened, Mrs Robertson said it was not until she got home that she cried: ‘I stood there and broke down.’ She added: ‘I never thought we’d be looking forward to spending Christmas with her.’ She added: ‘To look at Keira you wouldn’t think she has been through everything that she has. She‘s as healthy as can be.’","Keira Robertson was just 60 minutes old when her heart stopped beating .

He's barely spoken more than a handful of words since he was two, but eight-year-old Jack Robbins has finally found his voice. The little boy from Texas has severe nonverbal autism and can only utter single words about things he needs. But to his loving family's delight, Jack last week started singing the refrain from Katy Perry's hit song 'Roar': 'You can hear me roar!' Scroll down for video . Gorgeous: Jack Robbins, eight, shocked his family by singing the popular refrain from Katy Perry's song 'Roar' Jack's devoted mother Carla Robbins posted the heartwarming video to YouTube, where it has received nearly 300,000 likes. 'I . was completely amazed and so excited,' Robbins, from Frisco, told NBC Today. 'For all these years, I’ve cooked for him, I put things on him, I dress . him. 'I don’t know if he likes them or hates them. This is . huge for me to finally know something that he likes. 'He works really hard and he takes what he gets. Sometimes I want him to say, 'I don’t like that'. 'He never does. Now I know something he likes and I’m so grateful for that.' By the time Jack was diagnosed with autism at age two, he lost his ability to utter single words like 'mama' and 'dada'. Intensive speech therapy helped him regain his severely limited vocabulary. Robbins said her son often tried to sing along to tunes the family played, making irregular noises in a 'sing-songy' way. So when the young boy began repeating a line with no background music playing, Robbins, her husband Brent Robbins and their son Joe, six, paid attention. 'That’s when we tried to decipher what he was saying,' Robbins said. She said when the family worked out what he was singing, they filmed him. 'When I showed it to him, he loved it,' Robbins said. 'He seemed really excited that we knew what he was saying.' She said Perry's song has become the family's 'anthem' after years trying to understand how to help and understand Jack. 'I hear it all the time and it makes me tear up every time I . hear it because I think of Jack,' she said.

'It serves to help calm and relax children with autism and it’s potentially a means for them to help develop language,' Dr. Ann Neumeyer, a pediatric neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said. 'If you can get them to use this . alternative pathway through music to start speaking, then it helps . grease the wheels for language.' It's not the first time someone with autism has used music to express themselves. Last year, 25-year-old Kyle Coleman recorded nine cover songs, stunning experts with his amazing singing voice.

Research by neuroscientists found under 25s are the least affected by charity and almost half have never donated . Although most of us would like to think we’re selfless and kind, deep down this may not be the case. Neuroscientists from Mindlab put hundreds of people through subconscious tests about their views on generosity and charity. It discovered under 25s are the least affected by charity and around half of those studied had never donated. This was despite 82 per cent of them considering themselves altruistic. This age group was also found to be the most sceptical about donating to charity with 67 per cent claiming they didn’t think charitable donations made any real difference. The most generous group were the over 55s with 63 per cent regularly donating. As part of the study, Brighton-based Mindlab showed 200 participants from across the UK a video about a child with a life-threatening condition having a wish granted by the Make-A-Wish foundation. All the participants then completed an Implicit Association Task (IAT). IATs are designed to determine the strength of a person’s subconscious association between themselves and a particular concept. In this case the participants were asked questions about their association between their subconscious and the concepts of  ‘generosity’ and ‘selfishness’. The questions included how strongly they associate themselves with generosity and selfishness, how happy they think charity makes them feel and the importance they place on charity. They were then asked 10 questions about their likelihood of doing various altruistic good deeds in the future. Commenting on the findings, Dr Lewis told MailOnline: 'There are a number of reasons why [under 25s] are less likely to be . charitable. The study also revealed how altruistic people across the UK are. People in Northern Ireland donate to charity the most while people in the east of England are considered to be the least altruistic. A third of Londoners said they give to charity but are sceptical unless they see the end results . 'They are particularly media savvy and socially conscious; aware of institutions who aren’t transparent. They’re more likely to . respond to those whose actions follow their words, where they can see a . difference being made and the end benefit to individuals. 'The most . effective way to stimulate charitable engagement amongst this group is . via social media. Under 25s are encouraged by friends who are being . charitable. If they see their peers raising money, then they’re likely . to get involved and donate.' To test the results of the ITAs, the researchers also commissioned a separate UK poll. It asked 1,873 people about charity, donations and altruism. Under 25s are the least affected by . charity and almost half (48 per cent) of those studied said they had never donated. This was . despite 82 per cent of under 25s considering themselves altruistic. This age group was also found to be the . most sceptical about donating to charity with 67 per cent claiming they . didn’t think charitable donations made any real difference. The most generous group were the over 55s with 63 per cent regularly donating. A third of Londoners . said they give to charity but were sceptical unless they see the end . results. While people in Northern Ireland . donated to charity the most, the most generous age group were the over 55s with 63 per cent regularly donating. The study revealed many people find it hard to be charitable without knowing where their donations are being directed. A third of Londoners in particular said they give to charity but are sceptical unless they see the end results; preferring to see the direct impact of their donations. The study also revealed how altruistic people across the UK are. People in Northern Ireland were found to donate to charity the most, while people in the east of England were considered to be the least altruistic. Neuroscientist Dr David Lewis, who compiled the report with Mindlab, said: ‘The participants of our study saw a child’s wish come true and it made them kinder. ‘We called this ripple effect a Wish Wave - the participants saw the stimulus, it touched their hearts and made them more likely to commit an act of kindness.' Dr Lewis also noted that when people focus on an individual, rather than on a group, this level of empathy increases. ‘The research would indicate that those communities in which a child has had a wish granted could, themselves, become more charitable and generous minded in the future,’ Dr Lewis continued. Over a third of people admitted they get an instant rush of happiness after doing a good deed, and this was most common in the northwest of England. Dr Lewis concluded: ‘People are far more likely to be moved, and to donate more money, to a single suffering individual than to a group of people. In the words of Mother Teresa: ""If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will’’ The researchers worked with Fairy and Make-A-Wish foundation to establish which groups are most likely to behave in an altruistic and charitable manner.","Poll finds people in the east are least likely to carry out selfless deeds .

Terrifying: A Subway worker was threatened with a machete as the store was raided by three masked men . While the hammer-wielding thief jumped over the counter, the man with the machete ran into the staff area.

A high-flying Morgan Stanley wealth manager has been accused of secretly filing sexual encounters with multiple women in his tony Upper East Side bachelor pad. John Kelly shot videos of his sexcapades with three different women between September 2011 and December 2012, officials said. Revelations of the conduct drove one woman to trash his apartment. The women were in his apartment at separate times, the New York Daily News noted. Accused pervert: John Kelly has worked for Morgan Stanley for nearly a decade . ‘In this case, the defendant videotaped three unrelated women while they were performing sexual acts on him in his home,’ said prosecutor Siobhan Carthy during the financier’s arraignment, the paper reported. He faces three charges of second-degree unlawful surveillance, each of which carries a maximum four-year prison sentence. ‘Defendant did surreptitiously video record informant engaged in sexual contact with defendant and such images show informant’s breasts,’ said a criminal complaint cited by the Daily News. Victims ‘did not consent to such images being recorded and defendant did not have permission or authority to record or possess such images,’ the complaint continued. The breasts, buttocks and vagina of one of the victims could be clearly seen in the video, officials said. Over a decade in prison: Mr Kelly faces up to 12 years behind bars if convicted of all three charges . One of the women who found out about the secret recordings broke into Mr Kelly’s apartment, according to the Daily News. She trashed the place, poured soda onto his computer and was charged with burglary, but that case should be dismissed, the paper noted. Mr Kelly has ‘no arrests, no problems with the law, and an exemplary background,’ his attorney Robert Gotleib told the Daily News. He is free on $5,000 bail and had to surrender his passport. His next scheduled court date is March 11, court records showed.","John Kelly has been accused of secretly filming sexual encounters with three women .

Apple Maps has been a regular source of ridicule since it launched last year after claims it sent users onto airport runways and is missing entire towns, yet it seems the tech firm may have the last laugh. Figures from analytics firm ComScore has found that while Google Maps has lost almost a third of its users in the past year, Apple’s own mapping service has been slowly gaining in popularity. The rise is being attributed to the introduction of iOS 6,  which uses Apple Maps as the default navigator. Before Apple Maps (blue line) launched in September 2012, Google's own mapping service (orange line) was used by around 78% of iPhone and Android owners in the U.S. A year later, this figure has dropped to 43% while Apple's share has slowly risen to more than half of iPhone users . Up until last year Apple’s built-in mapping tools were powered by Google Maps. During his keynote speech at the World . Wide Developer Conference in June last year, ex-senior vice president of . iOS software Scott Forstall announced Apple would be switching to its . own version of Maps. The application was then officially released alongside the iPhone 5 in September 2012, yet was heavily criticised for being inaccurate. Apple briefly kicked the Google Maps . application off its store in 2009 because Google wouldn’t add . turn-by-turn navigation tools to its iPhone app – despite the feature . being available on the Android version. It was later allowed back on the store, yet this is thought to have been the reason why Apple began developing its own app. The research was carried out by The Guardian’s Charles Arthur. He compared ComScore figures from September 2012 – the month Apple Maps launched – to the same app usage figures from September this year. Last year, there were a total 103.6 million iPhone and Android owners and 81.1 million of them used Google Maps. During the same month in 2013, the number of phone owners has grown to 136.7 million, yet only 58.7 million of these people still use Google’s mapping service. This is a drop of almost 36 per cent in 12 months. During September this year, figures from ComScore also showed that 60.1 million people in the U.S. had an iPhone, and of that number, 35 million had used Apple Maps at least once. Apple Maps is only available on iPhones running the iOS 6 software and above. Based on ComScore's figures, 58 per cent of the possible people who can use Apple Maps, do. Alternatively, Google Maps is available on iPhones and Android phones, so the numbers are higher but the proportion of users is less. The Guardian also worked out that of the 58.7 million Google Maps users in September this year, 6 million used the app on an iPhone. Apple Maps, pictured left, is only available on iPhones running iOS 6 and above, and 58 per cent of people who can use Apple Maps, do. Alternatively, Google Maps, right, is available on iPhones and Android phones, so the numbers are higher but the proportion of users is less overall .

Reports last week claimed Google is planning to use location data about its customers to track them on the high street. Each time a user enters a store of business, Google would be able check their location and then see if that user looked at adverts for that company online beforehand. It would do this to check advert conversion rates. Google also serves adverts on its Maps app meaning if fewer people are using it, fewer people will see their ads.

'Got sums wrong': Alan Johnson said the numbers coming were much greater than the forecast . Alan Johnson yesterday became the third former Labour Home Secretary this week to admit their party’s open door immigration policy had been wrong. Mr Johnson, who presided over the Home Office under Gordon Brown, suggested Labour had encouraged immigration while in power to boost the economy, but he conceded they had ‘got the sums wrong’. In a bombshell intervention earlier in the week, Jack Straw said throwing open Britain’s borders to migrants from Eastern Europe had been a ‘spectacular mistake’. Mr Straw, who was Home Secretary under Tony Blair, said it had been ‘a well-intentioned policy we messed up’. And David Blunkett, who also served under Mr Blair, warned this week that racial tensions could ‘explode’ unless migrants ‘change their culture’ and work harder to integrate in Britain. Labour’s reputation on immigration has been shredded following a 2004 decision to not restrict workers when eight former Soviet bloc countries joined the EU. The Government predicted up to 13,000 migrants would come to Britain each year and fill job vacancies, but the total over a decade was more than a million. Mr Johnson said: ‘There was a very good argument for doing it, but they got the sums wrong and the numbers coming were much greater than forecast. It was good economics and bad policy.’ He told the BBC: ‘It was 2004 and three things were happening. The birth rate was going down. The dependency ratio – the amount of people working compared to the number of people retired – went down from 12 to one, when Lloyd George introduced the pension, to four to one. 'And it was due to go down to two to one – two people working for every one person retired. And we had a 75 per cent employment rate – one of the highest we had ever seen. Back track: Mr Straw wrote in his local . newspaper that the decision was made based on data showing 5,000 to . 13,000 migrants a year would come to Britain. 'Events proved these . forecasts worthless' Concession: David Blunkett, here in 2004 with Tony Blair, also warned the influx of migrants could cause riots . ‘So for Sweden, Britain and Ireland, the three most successful economies – although you might wonder what that success was based on – there was a lot of sense in doing that.’ Ed Miliband has apologised for the last Labour government’s immigration policy. The Labour leader has also attempted to toughen up the party’s language on the issue, although it is yet to be backed up by significant new policies to curb numbers. Opinion polls consistently show Labour trailing the Tories on the subject. Meanwhile, Ken Livingstone yesterday attacked the ‘cowardice’ of the last Labour government’s economic policies, saying Mr Brown borrowed too much in order to avoid having to raise taxes. Eviction: Border Agency officials evict immigrants from a derelict site in London. Despite raids such . as this a report has found that just one in every 67 reports of illegal . immigration result in a person being deported . The former London Mayor also warned Mr Miliband and shadow chancellor Ed Balls against pinning their economic strategy on increased borrowing. He said: ‘I don’t believe that borrowing is your way to the future. The simple reality is that British governments, Left and Right, have borrowed money because they haven’t had the courage either to make the cuts that you need to balance the budget or the tax increases you need to balance the budget. ‘Gordon Brown was borrowing £20billion [a year] because he wanted to increase public spending. It was an act of cowardice.’","Former Home Secretary David Blunkett warned of migrants causing riots .

"By . Alex Greig . PUBLISHED: . 12:08 EST, 28 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:09 EST, 28 July 2013 . How much money would you need to have before you considered yourself rich? Would it be $100,000? $500,000? According to a new study, among millionaires, that number should be at least $5 million. The study, entitled 'What is Wealthy?', conducted by investment firm UBS, found that only 28 per cent of investors with between $1 million and $5 million in investable assets considered themselves rich. Those with $5 million or more felt a little more comfortable - for that group, 60 per cent felt rich. Mo' money, mo' problems: People with between $1 million and $5 million don't think they're rich . The study found that investors defined wealth not as having a finite amount of money but rather having 'no financial constraints on their activities.' This may seem strange to those of us who don't inhabit the rarefied world of millionaires, especially when you consider that the median household income in the U.S. is $51,500 per annum. But according to David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer-prize winning author specializing in economics and tax, living as a millionaire among millionaires creates a chronic case of 'keeping up with the Joneses'. 'In New York City, being wealthy enough to own upright a property worth $5 million doesn't make you feel rich, because you're surrounded by people who can buy and sell you in a two hours income,' he told ABC News. 'There are always some people around you who have more. Also, having $5 million in Keokuk, Iowa, is a lot different than having $5 million in New York or Silicon Valley or Seattle.' Rich hitch: 60 per cent of those with more than $5 million concede they are indeed rich - others believe freedom from financial constraints equates to true wealth . The study also found that among the rich, there's a lack of confidence about the future. It seems that for millionaires, the more you have, the more you have to lose. While the uber-rich fret about losing their money, more than three-quarters of Americans are living paycheck-to-paycheck, according to a study by Bankrate.com. The Bankrate.com study found that half of all Americans have less than three months savings to depend on in straitened times, while a quarter have none at all. 'To us, the surprise was that that many people with $1 million or more did not consider themselves wealthy,' Emily Pachuta, head of investor insights at UBS Wealth Management Americas told ABC. 'We think it shows a very interesting mindset shift. People have certainly experienced a shock from the volatility of the market, and they are very aware that it takes a significant amount of money to have that dual feeling of having enough money and no financial constraints.' For many, being wealthy means the burden of taking care of relatives falls squarely on their shoulders. It's all relative: While the median household income in the U.S. is just over $50,000, those with millions often feel a need to keep up with the Joneses and don't feel wealthy compared to richer peers . Four out of five of the 4,450 investors who answered the survey were providing financial support for aging parents and/or grown-up children. 'This has a real impact on the definition of a comprehensive financial plan. The top two personal concerns for investors are long-term care and the financial situation of children and grandchildren,' states the study. 'When a financial plan addresses those two concerns, confidence in achieving goals skyrockets to 85 per cent [from 62 per cent].' For the millionaires surveyed, security comes in the form of cash. UBS found that investors maintain peace of mind by holding onto at least 20 per cent of their money in cash to cover for any emergencies and ensure they can make large purchases without having to sell assets. As for the rest of us, the American Dream is becoming harder and harder to reach. According to a study by the Equality of Opportunity Project, one-third of those who are born into the top one per cent of wealth will earn $100,000 per annum by the age of 30, while only one in 25 of those at the bottom end of wealth will reach that income level.","A study by UBS found that only 28 per cent of investors with $1-$5 million feel rich .

The European Union’s ‘addiction’ to red tape was laid bare yesterday. Since the 2010 general election Brussels has handed down almost 3,600 pieces of new regulation and directives affecting British businesses. A campaign group said last night that the 13million words contained in the deluge of bureaucracy would take more than 92 days to read in all. UK firms are being 'strangled' by the European Union's 'addiction' to red tape, Business for Britain has claimed . Business for Britain said the avalanche of directives is strangling UK firms and making it harder to compete with corporations in the US and in emerging markets in the Far East and South America. David Cameron has pledged to hold talks to get some powers back from Brussels and to reduce the burden of red tape on business, ahead of a 2017 referendum on membership of the EU. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain, said: ‘The EU has an addiction to red tape that desperately needs to be tackled. ‘The forthcoming renegotiation with Brussels must focus on overhauling its approach to regulation, for the good of jobs and growth in Britain.’ David Cameron has pledged to hold talks to get some powers back from Brussels and reduce the burden of red tape . The organisation’s research found that since the start of this Parliament in May 2010, a total of 3,589 regulations and directives affecting UK businesses have been handed down from Brussels. It would take a businessman, working an average eight hours a day and reading at an average speed of 300 words a minute, 92 days to read all the 13,321,530 words in all the business-related EU red tape enacted since the current government came to power. This equates to around a month’s worth of reading every year to keep on top of new regulations. Last week, inventor Sir James Dyson was forced to lodge a legal challenge to new EU labelling regulations for vacuum cleaners. He claims the new labelling rules make it look as if Dysons are less energy efficient than they actually are. Over the past few months, UK companies have had to fight proposed EU legislation such as measures to ban the Union Jack from packs of meat, enforce quotas in boardrooms and prohibit refillable olive oil jugs in restaurants. In the past three months alone, the EU has found time to issue regulations on anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay, the labelling of spirits and the use of rosemary extracts in certain low-fat meat and fish products. Other regulations cover the authorisation of ammonium chloride as a feed additive for ruminants, cats and dogs, and the use of certain additives in seaweed-based fish roe substitutes. Inventor Sir James Dyson lodged a legal challenge to new EU labelling regulations for vacuum cleaners . Another regulation changes the botanical . name of the tomato, and another concerns maximum residue levels for . ‘clodinafop (a herbicide), clomazone, diuron, ethalfluralin, ioxynil, . iprovalicarb, maleic hydrazide, mepanipyrim, metconazole, prosulfocarb . and tepraloxydim’ in or on certain products. There are also directives forcing television manufacturers to change their ‘ecodesign’ requirements for standby functions, and forcing makers of water heaters to change energy consumption labelling . Mr Elliott said: ‘No one would argue that a single market needs some regulation to function properly, but the volume and frequency of new directives being generated is a serious restraint to British businesses. ‘This is why I welcome the formation of the government’s EU regulation taskforce and its drive to identify the EU’s most pernicious business regulations.’ Business for Britain is a campaign for a better deal from the EU, backed by more than 750 UK business leaders.","Business for Britain said there are 13million words in the laws .

Employees should be tested to see if they have alcohol problems which could be affecting their work, campaigners have warned. A quarter of Britain's workforce is drinking at a dangerous level  - putting their health at risk, costing the economy £7.3billion a year, and leading to 17 million lost work days, they say. Don Shenker, founder of the Alcohol Health Network, said that workers should take a 'self-awareness test' to show if they have a potential drink problem  - and warned that many would be surprised by the results. How do you score? Take this quiz to ascertain if you have a drinking problem - noting the number score given to your answer from 0-4.  An overall score of 0-7 indicates a lower risk of dependency, 8-15 is classed as an increased risk, 16-19 indicates a higher risk and 20+ indicates possible dependence. (Source: World Health Organisation) The programme called AUDIT –  Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - asks people questions such as how often they drink, how many units they consume and about the feelings they experienced after, such as guilt or remorse. The score is then collated and ranked in four brackets - from 'lower risk' of harm to 'possible dependence' on alcohol. Writing on the British Medical Journal’s website, bmj.com, Mr Shenker said if test takers find themselves in the highest bracket, they should then be given advice and help to control the problem. Mr Shenker told MailOnline: 'People often don't realise how much they are drinking - and when they take the test, it can be a bit of a shock. 'Around a quarter of people who take the test find they are drinking at an increasingly risky level.' He added: 'Offering staff confidential use of AUDIT – and brief advice as a self-awareness initiative at work, whether through face to face interactions or leaflets – may well help prevent problems with alcohol at an earlier stage. Employees should be tested to see if they have alcohol problems which could be affecting their work, campaigners have warned . This NHS poster shows the amount of units alcoholic drinks contain . 'In this way, staff who may be concerned . about their drinking or whose level of drinking is not yet apparent to . them, can assess the risks their drinking poses to their health and take . appropriate action. 'Reducing hazardous drinking also reduces the risk of dependent drinking occurring.' He said: 'Employers need also to be convinced of the business case for prevention rather than cure... that it is ultimately more cost effective to prevent and reduce harmful drinking in the general working population, compared with the costs of managing dependent drinking among a minority of staff.' He said that there had long been a 'workplace culture of mixing alcohol with off duty . relaxation and stress management' and that it remains as strong as ever in the UK’s . private and public sectors. But he warned heavy drinkers risked the sack if it got out of hand. He added: 'Employers can help staff get the ­balance right while also contributing to a general reduction in alcohol related harms and costs to society.'","A 'quarter of Britain's workforce is drinking at a dangerous level'

Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt says he ate 100 McDonald's chicken McNuggets a day at the 2008 Olympics. During his ten days in Beijing, he estimates he downed 1,000 McNuggets as he set three world records, earned three gold medals and dashed onto the world stage. Celebrating: Jamaica's Usain Bolt pulls out his signature move, 'Bolting,' after setting a world record in the men's 4X100 meter relay at the Beijing Olympics games . Favorite food: Bolt estimates he downed 1,000 McDonald's chicken McNuggets during his 10 days in Beijing - eating two boxes of 20 for breakfast and dinner and one for lunch . Bolt writes in his new book, Faster Than Lightning, that he found Chinese food 'odd,' so he bounded over to the nearest McDonald's and ordered his favorite food, the New York Post reports. 'At first I ate a box of 20 for lunch, then another for dinner. The next day I had two boxes for breakfast, one for lunch and then another couple in the evening. I even grabbed some fries and an apple pie to go with it,' Bolt says. By that estimation, Bolt was consuming 4,700 calories, 295 grams of fat and 9,000 milligrams of sodium every day - and that's not counting dipping sauces. Chicken nuggets have recently been the subject of scrutiny from nutritionists and food scientists. A recent study by University of Mississippi researchers analyzed the components of chicken nuggets from two national fast food chains and found that each one was less than half chicken muscle meat. Researchers found that the nuggets contained large amounts of bone, cartilage, fat, nerves and organ linings. Bolt says he had a 'don't ask, don't tell' relationship with his longtime girlfriend Mizicann Evans after he rose to international fame and women began 'throwing themselves at him' Success: Bolt won three gold medals and set three world records at the 2008 games. His success catapulted him to international fame . Tell all: Bolt's autobiography is due out Tuesday . The researchers didn't name the fast food chains from which they bought the chicken nuggets in question. In 2003, McDonald's came out with all white meat McNuggets after they were branded 'a McFrankenstein creation' by a federal judge. U.S. chicken McNuggets came under scrutiny again in 2010 when it was revealed they contain butylhydroquinone, a petroleum-based preservative tertiary, and dimethylpolysiloxane, an anti-foaming agent also found in Silly Puddy. Experts say the chemicals are used in only trace amounts and are not harmful. Bolt also revealed in his book, due out tomorrow, that after becoming an international superstar women began throwing themselves at him. He says he developed a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy with his then-girlfriend, fellow Jamacian runner Mizicann Evans. He writes: 'I was able to get any lady I wanted... I could walk into a party and take my pick. I would go into a club and think, ""Hmm, a’ight, which one? You . . . ? You . . . ? Oh, you! Let’s do this.""' The couple has since split up. Bolt's record-setting moves on the track might be all his own, but his signature celebration moves were actually dreamed up by a friend. His 'Bolting' dance, in which he pulls back an imaginary arrow and fires it into the heavens, was the idea of a dancer friend from Jamaica. 'I’d made a deal that if I won the 100, I would bust some crazy dance move. It was called ""Di World,""' the sprinter says.","Jamaican sprinter says he found Chinese food 'odd' so he subsisted on McDonald's during his 10 days in China for the 2008 Olympics .

The christening service of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son, Prince George, will take place at 3pm next Wednesday, Kensington Palace confirmed today. The baptism will be held in The Chapel Royal at St James's Palace and will last 45 minutes. It will, as previously revealed, be conducted by The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby. One of the reasons for a late afternoon . ceremony is that the Queen is holding a reception at Buckingham Palace . earlier in the day for the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust. Christening: Prince George was born on July 22 and is third in line to the throne . But royal aides say no further details about godparents and other guests or the order of service will be given out until the day. Last week the Mail revealed that senior members of the Royal Family including the Countess of Wessex and Princess Anne have been left off the guest list. It is highly unlikely that Prince William's uncles, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, will attend either. In a break with Royal tradition, the couple have chosen to hold an 'intimate' ceremony at the Chapel Royal of St James's Palace - where the body of Diana, Princess of Wales, lay before the altar for a week before her burial in 1997 so her family could pay their last respects. The Archbishop of Canterbury said he was looking forward to welcoming Prince George into the 'family of the church' in a statement released two weeks ago . The couple chose the venue over the Music Room at Buckingham Palace - where Prince William, Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and Princess Anne were all baptised - and the private chapel of the royal residence, where the Queen herself was christened. It is understood that William and Kate favoured the Holbein-decorated . Chapel Royal because it is, in the words of one royal aide, 'an . historic, quite intimate chapel.' 'It is something they have been thinking about for some time and they just very much liked personally,' they said. The . couple have long made clear they aren’t sticklers for royal convention: . whether it be William ripping up the suggested 700-strong guest for his . wedding because he 'hardly knew anyone on it' or their decision to . release a family snapshot of George taken by Kate’s father, Michael . Middleton, instead of a formal portrait following his birth on July 22. And the couple have other personal links to St James's Palace, where until recently their Household was based. And . in April 2011, Kate chose the chapel to be formally confirmed into the . Church of England before her marriage to Prince William. The last official royal christening to take place at St James's Palace was that of Princess Beatrice in December 1988. It . is likely that the Prince George will be christened in a replica . Honiton lace gown of that worn by Queen Victoria's eldest daughter in . 1841. The original intricate . lace and satin christening robe was specially crafted for Victoria, the . Princess Royal, and used by generation after generation of royal . infants including William himself. Prince Edward's daughter, Lady Louise Windsor, was the last royal baby to wear the delicate ensemble in 2004. The Queen then commissioned an identical handmade copy so the 172-year historic outfit could be carefully preserved. It was made by the Queen's dresser Angela Kelly and her team of dressmakers at Buckingham Palace. Tearing up the rule book: The couple have long made clear they aren't sticklers for royal convention . The . Queen and Duke of Edinburgh will attend Wednesday's christening along . with the Prince of Wales, a grandfather for the first time, and the . Duchess of Cornwall. Kate's . family - parents Carole and Michael Middleton – will also be invited . along with the godparents, about whom royal aides have promised more details on the day of the christening. In . line with royal tradition, George is likely to have six god-parents and . among the names in the frame are William's best friend Thomas Van . Straubenzee, his former private secretary Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton and . ex-nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke. Several of Kate's friends are also in the running, along with her sister, Pippa, and brother James. The . christening will also allow a truly historic family photo to be taken – . and released to the public - no doubt delighting the 87-year-old Queen. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh will attend Wednesday's christening of the third in line . For the first time in more . than a century, three heirs to the throne are alive: Prince Charles, . 64, Prince William, 31 and new-born George. The . last occasion such picture was taken was in 1894 when Queen Victoria . was photographed with her son Edward VII, grandson George V and great . grandson Edward VIII. The . existence of a Chapel Royal itself dates back many centuries and, . originally, was not a building but an establishment: a body of priests . and singers to serve the spiritual needs of the Sovereign. During . Tudor times the Chapel would follow the Sovereign around the country to . whichever Palace or great house was in favour at the time. Since Whitehall Palace burned down in the late 17th century the Chapel Royal has been based exclusively at St James's Palace. The building was originally constructed by Henry VIII and decorated . by Hans Holbein in honour of the king's fourth marriage to Anne of . Cleves.

At the end . of the Civil War, Charles I also received the Sacrament of Holy . Communion in the Chapel Royal at St. James's Palace before his execution . in Whitehall in 1649. Three special coins will be made to mark the Prince George's christening, the Royal Mint has announced. A . gold kilo coin, a silver £5 coin and a 'more affordable' £5 coin have . been approved by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Queen and the . Chancellor. Birthday money: This £5 coin was previously issued by the Royal Mint to mark the birth of the Royal baby . This will be the first time that new coins have been produced in the UK to mark the christening of a member of the Royal Family. Details of the prices and how many will be created have yet to be announced. Shane . Bissett, of The Royal Mint, said: 'The Royal Mint has celebrated . moments of national significance for over 1,000 years and it was felt . appropriate to produce the first-ever set of Royal christening coins to . mark the christening of our future king. 'As . a British institution, The Royal Mint has played a central role . creating works of art as official commemorations of landmarks in the . history of the Royal Family for hundreds of years. These coins will be a . fitting addition to that long tradition.' A . £5 silver proof coin has already been issued to mark the birth of the . future heir to the throne and other commonwealth countries including . Canada and New Zealand have also issued coins to commemorate the birth. The £5 Royal Birth coin was priced at £80 from the Royal Mint, and is currently sold out. Queen .

Facebook channelled profits through a series of tax havens in order to pay just  £2.9m of corporation tax on more than £800m of overseas profits in 2011, it has been reported. Like Google and Apple the social networking site is said to have used its headquarters in Ireland to avoid tax liabilities in the UK before directing earnings to a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands. British companies that buy advertising on Facebook must do so via Facebook Ireland Ltd which entitles the company to sidestep HM Revenue and Customs and authorities in other higher-tax jurisdictions, reported the Sunday Times today. Under the spotlight: Mark Zuckerberg's (pictured) Facebook last year funnelled earnings into the Cayman Islands via Ireland in order to pay only a fraction in tax on more than £800million of overseas profits . As a result less than £240,000 was paid to the UK taxman. The Dublin office, with a staff of 400 people showed a gross profit of £840million in 2011. Despite this, Facebook Ireland posted a loss of £15million for the year after hundreds of millions were routed to a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands and to its parent company in the U.S. Labour MP John Mann recently spoke out about the company's actions, calling them 'disingenuous and immoral'. 'They benefit enormously from the country's internet infrastructure but do nothing to fund it. It's like driving a car with no tax. We would stand for it on our roads so why stand for it on the net?,' he said. Accounts for Facebook Ireland revealed that last year £440m was moved into an Irish sister company before being diverted to a subsidiary company in the Cayman Islands. A spokesman for Facebook defended its accountancy and said it complied with all relevant regulations and was acting within the legal bounds of taxation. 'Facebook complies with all relevant corporate regulations including those related to filing company reports and taxation,' he said. 'We have our international headquarters in Ireland that employs over four hundred people and a series of smaller local offices providing support services all over Europe. Dublin was selected as the best location to hire staff with the right skills to run a multi-lingual hi-tech operation serving the whole of Europe.' Facebook reported £620million in worldwide profit last year, 44 per cent of this came from outside the U.S. The news comes in the wake of similar behaviour from other multinational . companies like Starbucks and Google who use loopholes to avoid taxes. Storm in a coffee cup: Protesters are now planing 'creative direct action' against the company . It will renew pressure on the Government to close the loopholes that . allowed the companies to escape making any contributions to Treasury . coffers through corporation tax –despite raking in billions of pounds in . sales. Starbucks coffee chain is facing a boycott by . thousands of customers who are angry over revelations that it has paid just £8.6million in . corporation tax in its 14 years of trading in the UK and nothing in the . last three. Outraged . protest groups have promised ‘direct action’ against the coffee . giant and threatened to try to close some branches. Internet giant Google avoided tax on . £10billion revenue last year by doubling the amount of money put into a . shell company in Bermuda. Google's . decision to move nearly 80 per cent of its pre-tax profits to the . company, which is not subject to corporation tax on the Atlantic island, . saw the company slash its overall tax rate almost in half - avoiding . more than £1billion in payments. Chancellor George Osborne pledged to wage war on multinational companies paying little or no tax. In . his Autumn Statement, he said he would give HM Revenue and Customs a . further £77million to fight tax avoidance by wealthy individuals and . global firms. News . of the American company's latest legal attempt to avoid paying high . levels of tax comes after MPs recently criticised firms including . Google, who they claim are 'immorally' minimising tax bills. Earlier this year Facebook floated $104billion of shares in a initial public offering (IPO). Anger: Web giant Google avoided paying $2billion in tax last year by moving around 80 per cent of its overseas profits to a company in the tax haven of Bermuda . But the much-hyped flotation fell flat by the closing bell, finishing at only 23 cents more than its expected opening price. Some market experts blamed trading problems and an anxiety-filled half hour where traders were having problems placing and cancelling orders for Facebook stocks. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg – who owns 503.6million shares in his company – is worth an estimated $19.25billion and has become one of the wealthiest people in the world in a single day.

Olivier Sarkozy has turned his political attention to American campaigns as he is hosting a fundraiser supporting Massachusetts congressman Joseph Kennedy. Sarkozy, who is the half-brother of former French Prime Minister Nicholas, lives in New York and is dating Mary Kate Olsen. It is unclear why the 44-year-old banker is interested in a Congressional race in Massachusetts, hinting that he may be trying to make inroads with another famous political family. Political activist: Olivier Sarkozy (seen here with his girlfriend Mary Kate Olsen in November) is hosting a fundraiser in New York for Congressman Joe Kennedy from Massachusetts . Famous families: Sarkozy is the brother of the former French prime minister and Kennedy is the grandson of former Attorney General Robert Kennedy . Congressman Kennedy is the only member of the former president's extended family serving in Washington at the moment. The New York Post reports that Sarkozy- who has dual American and French citizenship- sent an email inviting guests to his home for a fundraiser on October 7. 'I believe Joe is the kind of new leader we need in Washington,' he wrote in the email. 'He is pragmatic, principled, and willing to look past party labels in the interest of getting things done . . . he brings fresh energy and much-needed perspective to our long-term economic and social challenges.' Republican ties: The only other political donations Sarkozy has made have been to Senators Mitch McConnell (left) and John Cornyn (right), both of whom are Republicans and neither of whom represent Sarkozy's home state of New York . It is unclear how many guests have . been invited, but each has been encouraged to contribute between $1,000 . to $5,200 to attend and be named as a co-chair. This . is not the first time that Sarkozy has donated to American political . campaigns, but it is the first time in recent years that he has contributed to a . Democratic candidate. According to the Center for Responsive . Politics, Sarkozy has donated to both Senator Mitch McConnell of . Kentucky and Senator John Cornyn of Texas. Both donations were for $1,300 a piece and they were made on June 13 of this year. New York Magazine reported that in 2004 during his marriage to his now-ex-wife Charlotte, the couple donated $5,000 to the John Kerry presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. 'They were really the first political couple in France. They were always compared to the Kennedys,' showing another interesting overlap to the dinner fundraiser for Joseph. Together: Sarkozy, 44, is dating the 27-year-old actress and fashion designer and the house in New York's East Village that they bought together is now on the market . Kennedy, . 32, assumed office just nine months ago but because of Congress' two-term cycle, apparently the October 7 fundraiser is already needed. When he came to office in January, his family name returned to the Capitol as his cousin Patrick's retirement from Congress in 2011 was the first time since 1947 that there was no Kennedy holding elected office. Now his solo stretch is coming to an end, as his second cousin Caroline, the daughter of JFK and Jackie, is in the process of being approved as the new American Ambassador to Japan.","The brother of the former French Prime Minister is hosting a fundraiser for Rep.

Cockney rhyming slang is being driven out by a new language sweeping across the country. The hybrid dialect, which, like cockney, combines slang with a different pronunciation, has been dubbed Multicultural London English by linguistic researchers. It was originally nicknamed Jafaican - fake Jamaican - but scientists have now said it is a dialect that been influences by West Indian, South Asian, Cockney and Estuary English. Popularised: Actor Idris Elba, left, and rapper Dizzee Rascal, right, helped spread MLE even further . Paul Kerswill, professor of socio-linguistics at York University, said: ‘There are two things going on: youth slang, which a lot of people use. ‘But there are [also] core users of MLE and to them it is a dialect and an accent. It doesn’t have to have slang in it. ‘It’s a new kind of Cockney in a way.’ Rap artists such as Dizzee Rascal and Hackney-born actor Idris Elba have helped to popularise the dialect in the UK. Though much of the slang is Afro-American or Jamaican in origin - with words such as ‘blud’ meaning friend and ‘ends’ meaning neighbourhood - the pronunciation is often not. In MLE ‘like’ is pronounced ‘lahke’, but this ‘ah’ sound in place of the ‘i’ is not West Indian. Mr Kerswill told the Sunday Times: ‘It is an extension of just using the slang. Blud (friend)Cotch (relax)Creps (trainers)Endz (neighbourhood)Bare (very) ‘All of these features have arisen out of the huge mix of languages and accents heard in some parts of London. This means they are home-grown. ‘It’s the slang that gives it a Caribbean or American feel and its use in British hip-hop adds to this impression, too.’ Like cockney, MLE users will omit or replace certain letters in words. The letters ‘th’ are usually replaced by an ‘f’ or ‘v’, as in ‘fink’ or ‘muvver’. But unlike cockney, MLE users do not drop their aitches. The language is often picked up at a young age, and particularly in schools where 50 per cent of pupils have English as a second language. Variants of MLE have also emerged in multicultural cities such as Birmingham and Manchester, Mr Kerswill said: ‘A lot of the core speakers are in the East End of London, where they have low opportunities, and so one of the mechanisms when people find themselves unable to make progress in life or [are] discriminated against is to speak differently, to use that as an exclusionary strategy.’","Linguistics professor identified the 'new cockney' hybrid dialect .

Die-hard Pokémon fans are grappling to bid thousands of pounds to land the world's most expensive card, dubbed 'the holy grail'. Seller Scott Pratte is demanding a staggering $100,000 (£64,000) for the Pikachu Illustrator Card - one of just six in circulation. As of today, 2200 buyers are 'watching' the bid, which ends on 18 September. 'The Holy Grail': The Pikachu Illustrator Card is one of just six produced in the world. The owner has already rejected 427 offers for the collectible which has previously sold for $20,000 . 'Gotta catch em all!': Protagonist Ash with his trusty side-kick Pikachu. The show sparked a craze for collecting the cards to simulate Ash's quest to attain all 649 pocket monsters. But the Ebay card is one of just six . The savvy owner from Edwardsville, Illinois, is also accepting bids of more than $50,000 - and has rejected all 427 offers so far. According to eBay statistics, the item is viewed at a rate of 230 people per hour. The international Pokémon phenomenon is one of the most lucrative animation franchises in history. More...

Hergé's hero gets a Scottish makeover as comic book is translated into dialect . Despite diminishing in popularity, the franchise is still running and releasing products, such as the 3D video game, Pokémon X and Pokémon Y, to be released in October this year. The Pikachu Illustrator card was invented as a prize for winners of Pokémon's official illustration contest in late 1997. The picture is of Pikachu, the most famous monster - a trusty side-kick to protagonist Ash. It says 'Illustrator' at the top, rather than 'Trainer' - the only card to do so. There is also a unique pen symbol in the bottom right-hand corner. Aside from the heading, all writing on the card is in Japanese. Only six of these cards exist - one of which is held by the Pokémon Group. The last recorded sale price for this card was $20,000. Schools worldwide were forced to bring in strict gambling rules in the late 1990s as children incessantly fought over the collectible trading cards sold in shops, magazines, and fast food meals. The series, part of the cartoon genre 'animé', launched in Japan in 1995. It follows Ash and his friends Misty and Brock as they fight evil with monsters, 'Pokémons', they can store in a small ball. Each Pokémon has its own special powers and different strengths. In the show, owners pit their pocket monsters against each other - the winner keeps both. As the slogan 'Gotta catch em all' suggests, the aim is to collect all 649 existing pocket monsters - a battle schoolchildren worldwide simulated using the collectible playing cards. Among the mass-produced cards, the most expensive, the Charizard, is £100 - although first-edition holographic versions can fetch up to £3,000. Even Team GB's judo star Ashley McKenzie admitted he took up the sport after a fight over his prized Charizard card. All Nippon Airways Co. painted characters from the cartoon on two jetliners - a B767 (foreground) and a B747. They appeared at Tokyo's Haneda International Airport on 2 July 1998, shortly before the craze hit Britain . International phenomenon: Schools had to create strict rules to curb children's manic enthusiasm for the show . He said: 'This Charizard was the best card. It was my life back then. 'I've gone to grab his shirt and next thing I knew I was over his shoulder.' After researching judo moves on the internet, McKenzie returned to reclaim his pricey commodity. He added: 'We spoke, we're friends, I started judo. Obviously I got my Pokemon card back.' The show was cancelled in 1998 after an incident in which 700 people were hospitalised with epilepsy symptoms . Pokémon, created by Satoshi Tajiri, started as a video game called Pocket Monsters in Japan in 1995. An instant hit, it was commissioned as a TV series in 1997. It was temporarily taken off air in 1998 after at least 700 viewers were hospitalised due to excessive use of strobe lighting and special effects in an episode on December 16 1997. People aged three to 58 suffered epilepsy symptoms for more than 24 hours. After returning to Japanese screens in April 1998, and renamed Pokémon, the series was syndicated to America - and soon became an international phenomenon. The franchise includes computer games, cards, TV shows, books, stickers, movies, toys, and even vitamins. The Pokémons were released in 'generations'. The first generation, labelled Red and Blue, consisted of the 'main' 151 characters. These reside in the fictional region of Kanto - inspired by Japan's Kanto district. The second generation, Gold and Silver, introduced 100 more Pokémon in 1999. Between 2002 and 2010, a third (Ruby and Sapphire), fourth (Diamond and Pearl), and fifth (Black and White) followed – with the sixth set to be released this year.","2200 buyers are 'watching' the bid, which ends on 18 September .

Producers of Brad Pitt's new movie provoked outrage when they filmed Nazi war scenes in an English village early in the morning on Remembrance Sunday. American director David Ayer staged pre-dawn explosions in Shirburn, Oxfordshire and had extras act out battle scenes dressed as Nazis as the rest of the UK readied itself to honour the nation's fallen heroes. Bosses behind the film, Fury, reportedly refused to stop filming over the weekend, despite a plea from the nearby Watlington Parish Council.

A nurse who was so drunk on duty she had to be treated by her own accident and emergency department has been struck off. Sheila Fletcher had taken a wine box on to her ward and did not notice she had cut herself when she smashed a bottle of medicine before colleagues intervened, a disciplinary hearing was told. She was stopped administering drugs at eight in the morning to unsuspecting patients after a colleague noticed she was behaving unusually. On duty: Nurse Sheila Fletcher has been struck off after bringing a box of wine with her to work and was drunk while treating patients at Hull Royal Infirmary (pictured) Fletcher was employed at the Hull Royal Infirmary and went to work on May 15 2011 after drinking at home. She told the ward sister that her arm felt tingly and that he head was 'not right', the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. An auxiliary nurse then reported that Fletcher has been seen in the toilet on her hands and knees clearing up 'pink fluid and broken glass on the floor'. The panel heard that she was so drunk, she had not noticed that her finger was bleeding where she had cut it. It was only noticed later that a nurse noticed that a diabetic man had not received any insulin and was suffering from high blood sugar levels. On another occasion she had failed to give drugs to a patient and doctored records to show that she had. When Fletcher's husband visited her later in A&E he confirmed she had been drinking at home. At a disciplinary hearing on February 7 2012, Fletcher admitted that she had taken a box of wine to work. 'It is the first time I recollect taking the bottle and the box (of wine) to the ward,' she said. 'I remember covering up the box of wine I had in my bag with my cardigan when I was in the lift. 'I had a box of wine, a bottle of wine in my locker,' she confessed. Case: The Nursing and Midwifery Council's offices in Portland Place, London, which heard how the inebriated nurse was taken to her own A&E . Rachel O'Connell, chair of the NMC panel, said: 'Having no information in relation to Mrs Fletcher's current employment or any information about her current personal circumstances, the panel could not be satisfied that she is no longer liable to put patients at unwarranted risk of harm or unlikely to act dishonestly in the future. 'Mrs Fletcher's actions and omissions represent a serious departure from the standards expected of a registered nurse. 'Her actions caused actual harm to her patients. 'She chose to cover up her omissions by falsifying patient records. 'Mrs Fletcher's health issues, which she had not properly addressed at the time of the allegations, also resulted in personal harm which saw her admitted to A&E. She concluded that nothing short of a striking-off order in these circumstances would maintain public confidence in the profession. The panel found allegations that Fletcher she attended work under the influence of alcohol and that she brought alcohol to work with her proved. They also found the nurse guilty of failing to test the blood sugar levels of patient failing to provide him with insulin and failing to document her errors. Allegations that she dishonestly forged the medication card for the patient were found not proved. Fletcher faced further allegations relating to her conduct in November 2010 when she was accused of failing to prescribe drugs to a patient and then falsifying records on the following day. The panel also found these allegations against her proved. Fletcher, who was not present or represented at the hearing in central London, was struck off the register.","Sheila Fletcher was treating patients in Hull while inebriated, hearing told .

Another Calais politician has launched a scathing attack on Britain for its policy on immigration which he claims attracts hundreds of illegal immigrants to the French Channel coast as they attempt to sneak into Britain. Deputy mayor Philippe Mignonet, the man tasked with solving the problem in Calais, called UK policy on migrants 'grotesque and hypocritical'. 'Britain says we don't want immigrants but does nothing to prevent black economy employment yet two million people work on the black in Britain,' he said. Asylum seekers in the French port town of Calais where as many as 30 a day are successfully smuggling themselves to the UK . In an interview with the newspaper Manche Libre he said his town is having to cope with up to 400 migrants at any given time and that numbers will soon approach those counted before the closure of the Sangatte Red Cross Centre and 'The Jungle ' - a squalid camp where Afghan and Iraqi refugees stayed before heading for the UK. 'The Town is facing something which is . beyond its limits and which must be handled at highest national and . European levels ', said Monsieur Mignonet. An estimated 400 migrants are currently living in dilapidated buildings or camping out at Calais. Last month mayor Natacha Bouchart sparked controversy by using her Facebook page to appeal to citizens to report new squats to the police. Some seeking refuge in Britain have put up signs around a camp in Calais . She too blames UK policies for welcoming migrants who queue up at Calais to stowaway to Britain on ferries. Madame Bouchart also points the finger at British anarchists belonging to the No Borders group which allegedly aids migrants to find squats . It has now emerged that desperate migrants have even taken to diving into the sea in apparent bids to stow away on cross Channel ferries. Last month mayor Natacha Bouchart sparked controversy by using her Facebook page to appeal to citizens to report new squats to the police . Others are believed to have even attempted to  swim the impossible 25 miles to the UK, it has emerged. One man known to be Eritrean disappeared, believed drowned, and another was fished out of the harbour at midnight on October 10 dressed only in a pair of underpants. The destitute African had stashed his meager possessions in plastic bags tied to a belt around his waist and managed to swim across the harbour in freezing waters. Weeping at the loss of his companion the 41 year old man was taken to hospital and treated for hypothermia. His body temperature had dropped to 32 degrees Celsius. In August last year the body of an unidentified Asian woman believed to have tried to swim across the Channel to England was found on a beach near Calais. The woman in her thirties was wearing a wetsuit and had energy drinks on her and a compass around her neck. She is believed to have succumbed either to hypothermia in the water or to have fallen off a cliff. In 2009 a successful French film named Welcome featured the heroic story of a swimming teacher played by charismatic actor Vincent Lindon who took pity on a Kurdish migrant desperate to reach the UK to be with his girlfriend. The teacher taught the young man to swim long distances in his local swimming pool. The Kurdish swimmer braved freezing waters, oil tankers and ferries in mid Channel only to die of cold and exhaustion within a short distance of the Kent coast. Sangatte refugee camp near Calais was closed in a bid to stem the flow of illegal immigrants crossing the Channel into the UK. The camp covered roughly the same area as Heathrow airport and contained an ex-Eurotunnel building that was requisitioned by the French authorities in September 1999. Sangatte was designed to hold about 900 refugees, but the Red Cross said numbers peaked at about 2,000. The village of Sangatte, with a population of 800, was actually smaller than the camp. The camp was demolished on the orders of Nicolas Sarkozy 10 years ago when he was Minister of the Interior. Sarkozy went further in 2009 after he became President, ordering  the razing of 'the Jungle,' a giant squat camp near the ferry terminal where hundreds of Asian migrants were living in makeshift huts. Last year the new socialist government of France has given its blessing to the construction of the first of a cluster of officially approved 'mini Sangattes' close to the port of Calais. These will house migrants hoping to stow away in cross Channel ferries to Dover and settle down in the UK.","Deputy mayor of Calais Philippe Mignonet made the remarks .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:06 EST, 3 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:35 EST, 4 November 2013 . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry moved Sunday to reassure America's Arab friends that the United States will not allow them to be attacked 'from outside,' in an apparent warning to Iran. Speaking in Egypt while en route to Saudi Arabia where he hopes to mend relations strained by Saudi unhappiness with U.S. actions in Syria, its tentative warming with Iran and stance on Egypt, Kerry acknowledged differences with some partners but stressed they shared common goals in each case. In addition, he said Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies in the Gulf could count on America's support. Making moves: John Kerry (L) first met Sunday in Cairo with Egyptian Defense Minister General Abdel Fatah el-Sisi . 'The United States will be there for the defense of our friends and our allies,' Kerry told reporters in Cairo. 'We will not allow those countries to be attacked from outside. We will stand with them.' He specifically mentioned the Sunni majority states of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan and Egypt as nations, along with unspecified 'others.' Those others likely would include Israel, the strongest U.S. ally in the region. All have vested interests in seeing an end to the turmoil in Syria and are extremely wary of Shiite Iran's regional intentions.But Saudi officials have been the most vocal. They have complained that the United States did not follow through on its threat to punish Syrian President Bashar Assad with military strikes for his government's use of chemical weapons. Last month, the Saudis won but turned down an elected seat on the U.N. Security Council, saying the body had proved itself largely meaningless because of its inability over two years to address the crisis in Syria. The Saudis also have watched with increasing nervousness as President Barack Obama has approved a cautious opening with their archrival Iran. Jetsetter: Mr Kerry then boarded a plane to Saudi Arabia . Kerry, who met late Sunday in Riyadh with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal and will see King Abdullah on Monday, acknowledged U.S. divisions with Gulf nations over Syria and Iran, but he played down those differences. He said some countries do differ with U.S. 'tactics' in Syria. 'There may some differences on a tactic here and there,' he said. But he said they all agree on the goal of ending the fighting and forming an interim government. 'We can have a difference on a policy, on the tactics of the policy,"" he said. 'For instance, there are some countries in the region that wanted the United States to do one thing with respect to Syria and we have done something else.' Arriving in Riyadh: Kerry (center L) is escorted by Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal bin Abdulaziz al-Saud (center R) just after landing . He stressed, though, that 'those differences on an individual tactic on a policy do not create a difference on the fundamental goal of the policy. We all share the same goal that we have discussed, that is the salvation of the state of Syria and a transition government put in place ... that can give the people of Syria the opportunity to choose their future.' Kerry said the United States would never allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. The administration is seeking a pause from the U.S. Congress in putting in place fresh penalties against Iran, in order to provide flexibility in negotiations. A new round of nuclear talks between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany is set to begin Thursday in Geneva. 'Iran will not get a nuclear weapon,' he said. 'That is a promise by the president of the United States.' His comments in Cairo came on the first stop of a 10-day tour of the Middle East, Europe and North Africa.","John Kerry stopped in both Egypt and Saudi Arabia .

These stunning images show a sacred ritual more than 100 years old at the Temple of Petilan Pengerebongan in Bali, Indonesia. Gruesome: Devotees at the temple of Petilan Pengerebongan in Bali, Indonesia, stab themselves in the neck without drawing blood in a traditional ceremony. They say they are protected by invoking a state of trance . Outer-body experience: The ceremony is known as Ngerebong and happens every 210 days, the length of a year in the Balinese calendar. People stab themselves with a dagger called a keris to unite with nature and God . Tradition: The daggers are made of iron, nickel and steel and are thought to have originated in the 10th century . The royal temple near the Balinese capital Denpasar played host to the ritual today, as it does every 210 days - the length of a traditional Balinese year. It is known as Ngerebong and is one of the most well-known religious ceremonies in the world. Worshippers in the deeply religious village of Kesiman gather for a day-long communion between the Hindu gods, nature and humankind. They start with rituals to summon Hindu spirits back to Earth, escalating until they work themselves into a mass trance. Devotees dressed in elaborate costumes of mythological beasts, complete with hair and wild eyes, gather around villagers dressed all in white with white headdresses. Residents of the tiny village have wild looks in their eyes as the religious ceremony reaches its climax . Communion: The ritual not only brings villagers closer to God, it also helps give them a sense of community . Pain: Young members of the community struggle under the weight of their companions as they enter a trance . The religious ceremony takes place in a village near the capital of the Indonesian island of Bali, pictured . As the ceremony reaches its peak, individual men start to thrash and scream and they stab themselves with their keris daggers. A traditional gamelan orchestra plays faster and faster, and women join the throng, shutting their eyes and moving as if on an otherworldly dance floor. The spectacle attracts tourists and photographers from around the world. The images below were captured by the award-winning Indonesian photographer Agung Parameswara. The ritual is said to date back to the 19th Century when it began under the reign of Pengerebongan, the first ruler of the village. It is said he invited all his subjects together to pay tribute to the gods together. To this day, the festival is held on the anniversary of the royal temple.

But who exactly should the 'tache growing man channel? The study asked women about their favourite moustachioed celebrities and was inundated with responses from fans of the rugged look.

Gillette's man of Style and Men's Health Style Director Dan Rookwood shares his top m's this Movember: . Take your pick! Here are our top tips on how to achieve your perfect mo of choice . The Crossbar - The great thing about this style is you can leave it for a few days and you'll still maintain a great moustache shape. However, if you wanted to achieve a more defined look, use a moulding cream to smooth the hair down from the top of the hair to the bottom, working the cream in the same direction as the hair growth . The Curler - Get yourself a strong moustache wax with an admirably manly scent to ensure your Mo stays in shape. Work the wax into the end of the hair and twist the hair away from your face to create the thin curly shape . The One Two - You need a good trimmer to achieve the intricacies of this look. Try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler which comes with a trimmer and edging blade to give you a great looking soul patch . The Sweeper - Use a moustache comb to make sure you achieve the manly tendrils this look demands. The great thing about this Mo style is you can get away with minimal grooming – the manlier the better . Pencil Thin - This Mo needs to look downy, think Chris Kamara. Use your trimmer to thin out your Mo to keep the hairs to a light lip dusting. Use your trimmer to achieve an even thin trim – I recommend a grade 3 clipper attachment. It's important to keep the lip clear, the lip should be totally visible and the moustache hair no longer than 0.5cm. This is also the best style for those who can't quite grow enough facial hair for a full on tache . (If you want achieve these looks but can't achieve them yourself, pop down to Gillette's pop-up Barber Shop on 7 Earlham St, Seven Dials, London anytime throughout Movember for a free MO shave.) The average man has up to 900 hairs on his MO alone, and between 6,000 and 26,000 on his entire face. Sleep deficiency has been known to slow down facial hair growth so make sure you get an early night this Movember. Men's facial hair grows faster than women's underarm or leg hair. Did you know that dry facial hair has the strength of copper wire of the same thickness? That is one tough MO you are sporting, old chap. Gillette scientists have calculated that men will spend a total of 32.5 days in their lifetime removing facial hair. If it is any consolation you don't have to shave your top lip for the next 30 days! During the month of Movember you can expect your MO to grow to up to 9mm-1cm in length. If you multiply that by the 900 hairs in the average moustache you have approximately 9 meters of hair in your MO alone. On average men spend 20 minutes on their appearance each morning and a total of 780 hours of their life shaving.","Over a fifth of women said they'd date a guy growing a 'tache'

Contrary to the Syrian President’s image as a thug and a murderer, Mr Schulenburg remembered ‘a sensitive young man who was incredibly polite and punctual’. ‘Everyone who worked with him found him that way,’ said Mr Schulenburg. ‘He wasn’t arrogant. You would never have guessed he was a president’s son. ‘He was quiet and never really spoke about his family. But if anyone asked him a direct question he very politely answered it honestly.’ Assad spent 18 months in London, living on his own in a rented flat, avoiding any obvious signs that he was the son of a powerful Middle Eastern dictator. He was fond of Phil Collins and Whitney Houston music, and thrilled by technology and computers. But in 1994, after the death of his older brother Basel in a car crash, Bashar was recalled to Syria and groomed for the role of President. In June 2000, after the death of his father, he took over the role of leader. At first he appeared to want to introduce modern, democratic reforms. But in recent years his methods of controlling rebels have become increasingly desperate. Mr Schulenburg said Bashar was well-skilled. ‘He did minor surgery in accident and emergency such as incising and draining cysts on eyelids or around the eye.’ In the family: President Assad (pictured second left as a child) was recalled to Syria to be groomed for leadership by his father and former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad (centre) after his older brother Basel (left) died in a car crash . The pair met again in 2002 when Mr Schulenburg was invited to a dinner with Bashar and his British-born wife Asma at Lancaster House in London, organised by the Syrian Embassy. It was December and Bashar had become the first Syrian President to have an audience with the Queen. It was the first time Mr Schulenburg and his wife Inge had met Asma, who they found ‘charming’. The Syrian President gave the Schulenburgs an open invitation to visit them in Damascus. In 2005, they took it up. ‘A presidential car was sent to collect us from the airport,’ Mr Schulenburg said. ‘But on the night we had dinner, Bashar drove us himself to a local Syrian restaurant.’ Bashar and Asma were the epitome of the glamorous jet-setting couple. Bashar had talked to the western world in precise English – smoothly describing his plans to make Syria a modern democracy. He had already made political enemies with neighbouring countries, but on this evening he appeared relaxed and happy. Dictator: US Secretary of State John Kerry branded Mr Assad a 'thug and a murderer' this week as the attacks in Syria worsened . Mr Schulenburg said: ‘We talked about politics, democracy and of course Syria. He struck me as someone who felt he had a job to do.’ In the wake of the chemical weapons attack that has prompted international revulsion, Mr Schulenburg said: ‘Remembering the young man I knew, the whole situation fills me with sadness and disbelief. ‘Using chemical weapons is not a decision I could imagine would have been made by the man I knew. But it could have been made by other people in the regime. ‘I am against bombing Syria – I wish the factions would talk. I also feel Bashar has few choices now. That he is no longer in control of his own destiny.’","Edmund Schulenburg trained President Assad in London's St Mary's Hospital in 1992 .

A study has revealed that crowded public transport doesn't increase the risk of catching the bug and that 'man-flu' doesn't even exist. In fact, children are the greatest spreaders of flu and women are most likely to catch it. Contrary to popular belief, people who use public transport are no more likely to get flu than those who do not . It also found that teenage women, specifically those living north of the Midlands, are the most likely to get the flu. The findings are part of the annual UK Flusurvey, now in its fifth year, which seeks to finds out who will get the flu each winter and maps out how the flu spreads across the nation. The UK Flusurvey reported people in North England and Scotland are slightly more likely to report having flu-like symptoms than people living in the Midlands, South England and Wales. Smokers are 12 per cent more likely to report having flu-like symptoms than non-smokers while people who have sustained contact with children are 17 per cent more likely to report flu-like symptoms. School children are most likely to report having flu and women report suffering the symptoms 18 per cent more than men . Staying off the train or bus doesn't . stop you getting flu - results suggest that people who regularly use . public transport are no more likely to develop flu-like illnesses than . people who do not use public transport. Dr . Alma Adler, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, . said: 'Last year we found that taking public transport does . not increase your risk of catching flu and we discovered that ""man flu"" didn’t really exist - in fact women were slightly more likely to report . feeling worse when they have flu than men. 'This . year we’re keen to find out more about children because they are the ""key spreaders"" of flu and the group who reported the most flu-like . illness in last year’s survey. 'With . the NHS beginning to roll out childhood flu vaccinations this year, . it’s an exciting time to see how this might change the way the virus . spreads.' UK Flusurvey collects data through an online questionnaire at flusurvey.org.uk from men, women and children of all ages around the country in order to map trends as seasonal flu takes hold. The data enables researchers to analyse how the virus spreads and who it affects. More than 6,000 people took part in the UK Flusurvey last year. Dr Adler added: 'Catching flu can be serious, potentially fatal in some cases. 'If participants can spare just a couple of minutes each week providing us with crucial data, we will increase our knowledge of flu and develop new methods to improve the handling of outbreaks of the virus.' Researchers want members of the public and schools across the UK to sign up to help collect as much data as possible in order to map this year’s flu trends and to help medics and health services prepare. Traditional monitoring methods rely on data from GPs or hospitals, but Flusurvey provides a unique insight because many people with flu-like illness do not visit a doctor.","Teenage girls living in the North of England are most likely to get the flu .

Kevin Gough, 43, died inside this chimney stack after becoming trapped at the bottom and not being able to breathe . A burglar who was found dead in a chimney at a solicitor’s office suffocated to death 'within minutes', his family was told today. Kevin Gough, 43, died in 'very unusual' and 'very tragic circumstances' when he got stuck inside the chimney stack at Moody & Woolley Solicitors in Derby, an inquest into his death heard. Derby and South Derbyshire coroner Robert Hunter said Mr Gough, whose chest was compressed by the narrow chimney stack, would have lost consciousness quickly, meaning he would not have been able to call for help for long. The serial burglar's body was discovered inside the chimney at Moody & Woolley Solicitors in St Mary’s Gate, Derby, on 1 May after staff noticed an unpleasant smell and called in a pest control firm. Mr Gough had not been seen since 15 March when he had breakfast at a charity for homeless people, the inquest was told. Derby and South Derbyshire Coroner’s Court heard that police were called and officers found Mr Gough’s badly decomposed body stuck inside the chimney. A post-mortem found he had brick marks across his back and chest from being squashed inside such a space so confined, his chest would not have been able to expand when he breathed. The coroner said Mr Gough's T-shirt had been pulled up around his neck and this would also have constricted his airway. The inquest was told that the chimney breast and fireplace had been completely bricked up from the inside, while a piece of Mr Gough's clothing was blocking the top, meaning there was no oxygen coming in. Mr Gough, whose last address had been St Helens, Merseyside, and who had served time in prison for a string of burglary convictions, was identified from his fingerprints.  The coroner found his death was caused by postural asphyxiation. Dr Hunter told Mr Gough’s mother, who was at the inquest with other family members, that her son would have passed out quickly. 'There would have been a rapid loss of consciousness,' he said, 'and death within a manner of minutes. The Victorian red-brick offices where Mr Gough's body was found after staff called in pest control workers . 'This would be why he did not call for help and the people working within the building had not heard him.' Recording a verdict of misadventure, Dr Hunter said methadone had been . found in Mr Gough’s liver but not enough to have caused . his death. He said: 'He had gone to that premises and had entered that chimney.  What he would not know is that the chimney had been blocked up.' 'His death would have been very, very quick - he would not have lingered in the chimney for two or three days.' - Derby and South Derbyshire coroner Robert Hunter . Dr Hunter said Mr Gough would probably have realised there was no way out when he got to the bottom, and he had got stuck. 'His death would have been very, very quick.' he said. 'He would not have lingered in the chimney for two or three days.  It’s a little bit of comfort, not a great comfort, I’m sure you’d prefer to have him alive and well.' The coroner said it was not clear why Mr Gough had gone into the chimney but he was satisfied he had made his way in there of his own accord and nobody else had been involved. Detective Constable Tom Bentley, of Derbyshire Police, told the inquest Mr Gough had been arrested on 13 March because he was found to be in possession of prescribed medication that was not in his own name. He was also wanted in connection with a burglary at a business nearby. Mr Gough, who was unemployed but had in the past worked as a blind manufacturer, was subsequently released from police custody and last seen alive two days later.","Kevin Gough, 43, was found dead in chimney stack at Derby solicitor office .

Shocked: Nancy Dell'Olio said on today's This Morning that she was surprised by Sven-Goran Eriksson's revelations . Nancy Dell’Olio has revealed she's started legal action against the publishers of Sven-Goran Eriksson's autobiography. Despite admitting she hasn't yet read the book herself, the 52-year-old Italian socialite said the contents breach a confidentiality agreement she signed with her ex-partner. 'I just started legal action against the . publishers. He is in breach of confidential order that we cannot talk . about certain details, so I am surprised at the publishers. It's breach of . confidentiality,' she said during an appearance on today's This Morning. Presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby were thrown by the revelation which comes after the former England manager, 65, published a tell-all book with Headline. In it, he claimed his nine-year relationship with Nancy had been a mistake after they started an affair while she was still married. He said he later regretted the fact Nancy left her husband for him as, after a romantic first few months together, she became increasingly demanding and annoying. He wrote: 'Nancy was very demanding. And it didn't take long before I started to feel a little cramped by her. She always had to be the centre of attention - and I wasn't used to this in a woman.' He added that if they went out, she would always make a fuss complaining about anything from the lighting to the drinks. Defending herself on This Morning, Nancy said: 'That does sound like me but he met me . when I was with my husband, it was not a surprise. Of course I am . demanding, if the champagne is not cold enough I will complain. Is . anyone surprised by this?' She added that she was 'saddened and surprised' by many of Sven's comments, including him stating that she wouldn't have been interested in him if he 'was a plumber'. 'It's funny, he was just a football manager,' she said. Scroll down for video . Fighting talk: Nancy told Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby that she has launched legal action against Sven's book publishers . She added that she expected him to have 'more style and elegance' than to write such a book but speculated it might have been due to 'financial troubles'. She said: 'You would expect a football manager to . write about football. But people are not interested in that, that is . the point. He had a fantastic career but why has he been forced to write . a horrible book like this and how proud he is of all the affairs he had. 'I don't recognise him completely. He doesn't sound like the person I met.' Sven had a number of affairs while he was living with Nancy and they eventually separated in 2006. She revealed on This Morning that the end didn't come because of his infidelity but because they fell out over her own plans to write a book. 'Is anyone surprised by this?' Nancy agreed she could be demanding as a girlfriend . She explained: 'He didn't want me to write a book but I . told him he had no right to tell me that. I assured him I wouldn't write anything . that was offensive. But we separated because he didn't want me to write the . book. Of course he had to be in it because he was part of my life for 10 . years.' Nancy did keep her word and described her relationship with Sven in her book as 'blissful throughout.' She admitted on This Morning this may have sugar-coated their time together somewhat as they had 'beautiful moments and terrible moments.' Bitter split: The couple separated in 2006 and Nancy said they no longer speak except through their lawyers . She added that it's a shame they are no longer friends and only see one another now with their lawyers. After they split, they fought a bitter legal battle over their former London home after she refused to move out of the £3.75million flat in Belgravia. She finally agreed to leave the apartment in April this year after he promised her £2 million. But it seems their legal battles are now set to continue.

A mother suffering from postnatal depression killed her six-week-old baby after refusing to take medication that would have helped her cope, a court heard yesterday. Natasha Sultan fractured the skull of her only child Amelia-Lilly in ‘an eruption of frustration’ before climbing into bed and falling asleep. Sultan, 21, had been prescribed anti-depressants by her GP but only took one tablet because of the ‘stigma’ associated with postnatal depression. Natasha Sultan, 21, killed baby Amelia-Lilly while in the grip of post-natal depression. Sultan fractured the skull of her six week-old daughter in 'an eruption of frustration' before falling asleep exhausted . Hull Crown Court heard Natasha Sultan (pictured), 21, from Hull, killed her baby daughter after shunning medication because she wanted to avoid the 'stigma' of the condition . The court heard that her mind was ‘disturbed’ at the time of her daughter’s death, which might have been avoided if she had taken the pills. She wept as she appeared in the dock at Hull Crown Court, where she pleaded guilty to a charge of infanticide. Sultan and her boyfriend James Curtis had been living in a house in Hull with their daughter, who was born last year on August 28. Only a few weeks after the birth, on October 7, Mr Curtis left to start a night shift working as a security guard, leaving his partner at home with Amelia-Lilly. At 10.30pm she sent him a text message which said she was planning to get some rest as the baby was asleep. But when he got home at 8am the following morning, Mr Curtis found his daughter lying unconscious and cold in her cot. He desperately tried to revive her and called an ambulance but Amelia-Lilly was pronounced dead the following day. Sultan initially told hospital staff that she had tripped and dropped the baby. However an X-ray revealed a bilateral fracture of her skull which was ‘non-accidental’. Prosecutor Tim Roberts said only ‘significant’ force would have produced bilateral fractures. He added: ‘The severity of the injuries were inconsistent with the accident fall from waist height to a carpeted bedroom floor.’ Malcolm Swift, defending, explained that Sultan had been diagnosed with postnatal depression after the birth. He said: ‘The drugs that could have saved this from happening were not taken. It’s just a matter of circumstance and regret that those tablets weren’t taken.’ Sultan, who was originally charged with murder, has been using a public Facebook page to pay tribute to her daughter. Alongside one picture of Amelia-Lilly . she has written: ‘Our gorgeous little princess RIP darling. It was the . best time of our lives.’ A death notice posted in their local newspaper described the baby girl as the ‘special daughter of Natasha and James’. It said: ‘You kicked your socks and scratch mittens off. You always peeped to see if one of us were holding you. Hull Crown Court heard Sultan admitted the rare charge of infanticide on the grounds that she suffered a 'temporary unbalance' of her mind . ‘You are our first baby, a beautiful daughter born. ‘All . that we have left are photos and memories of your hiccups and, most of . all, memories of you. Love and miss you so much baby girl.’ Judge . Jeremy Richardson explained that the crime of infanticide, which is . ‘very rare’, carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. But the . court heard that ‘virtually all’ past sentences have been non-custodial. He . said: ‘The facts are clear. You killed your child, your wanted and . loved baby, while the balance of your mind was disturbed.’ However he said he would need to take some time to consider the case before delivering a sentence. ‘This . is both an anxious and difficult case and a little time for reflection . is needed by me in order that I deal justly,’ he said.","Natasha Sultan, 21, fractured the skull of six week-old Amelia-Lilly .

No time behind bars: Austin Clem will not go to prison despite being convicted of three counts of rape dating back to when his victim was only 14-years-old . An Alabama prosecutor wants a state appeals court to review a judge's sentence for a man who was convicted on three counts of rape but avoided any time in prison. Limestone County District Attorney Brian Jones filed papers over the weekend asking the Court of Criminal Appeals to intervene in the case of Austin Smith Clem, 25, of Athens, a clerk said today. Jones also asked a judge to delay the no-prison sentence and temporarily incarcerate Clem. A petition filed with the appeals court argues the lenient sentence was illegal under state law because Clem was convicted of first-degree rape and two counts of second-degree rape. Clem should have been sentenced to at least three years in prison under the type of sentence the judge ordered, the prosecutor argued. A jury in September convicted Clem on three counts of rape in a series of sexual assaults on a neighbor and one-time family friend, Courtney Andrews. The woman, now 20, testified that Clem sexually abused her at age 13 and then again when she was 14 and 18. The defense argued there was no evidence of assault and characterized the victim as a 'scorned woman.' Clem could have faced decades behind bars, but Limestone County Circuit Judge James Woodroof last week handed down a sentence that means Clem won't have to spend any time in prison. Victim: Courtney Andrews has taken the unconventional step of publicly identifying herself and slamming her attacker's sentence . Woodroof sentenced Clem to spend two . years with a community-based corrections program that will allow him to . continue working and living at home, plus spend three years on . supervised probation. He . was ordered to pay $1,631 in restitution, to stay away from the victim . and her family, to register as a sex offender, and to complete . counseling. The victim has . told reporters she is outraged by the sentence, which the judge did not . explain in his order. The victims of sexual assault has not been . identified. Rita Pfaff, a friend of the victim, testified that the woman told her at age 16 about the sexual abuse at 13 and rapes at 14. Pfaff . said she witnessed the victim telephone Clem's wife to tell her what . had happened and that Clem's wife begged the victim not to tell police. Mr Clem might have his sentencing appealed after a prosecutor wants it to be reviewed . Pfaff . said the victim went to Clem's apartment when she was 18 because she . was lured there under false pretense - the chance of seeing his three . daughters - and another assault occurred. 'He . gets released into the free world with a slap on the wrist,' Pfaff . said. 'You don't do this three times and get to go home to three little . girls with the chance of doing it again.' Court . records show Jones asked Woodroof the order Clem to jail while the case . is under review, but the judge did not rule immediately. ‘My . family was very relieved to hear the three guilty verdicts,’ Courtney’s . father Richard Andrews told AL.com. ‘We were floored to hear the judge . hand down such a light sentence.’ Explaining that she was ‘livid,’ Ms Andrews recalled to the site ‘I thought, 'How is this even possible?’","Austin Clem raped his neighbor three times between the ages of 14 and 18-years-old .

Police have issued an arrest warrant for the rapper boyfriend of Amish Mafia star Esther Schmucker, who allegedly brutalized his actress girlfriend in an attack on Halloween, breaking her nose, teeth and cheekbones. Schmucker, who stars in the Discovery Channel TV docu-drama, has previously filed at least three protection-from-abuse orders against her boyfriend Imir R. Williams - who also goes by the stage name Mirkat and is from Strasburg - however she failed to attend any of the court hearings so they were dismissed. Now police are actively searching for Williams after Schmucker told them he repeatedly punched her in the face during an assault on October 31 at their home in Lancaster Country, Pennsylvania, where Amish Mafia is filmed. The criminal complaint against Williams - who is black, 6-foot-4 and weighs 210 pounds - states that the alleged assault occurred between 1 and 2 a.m. Thursday at the home he shared with Schmucker in the 200 block of North Decatur Street, Strasburg.

Police were alerted to the incident by officials at Lancaster Regional Medical Center after Shmucker arrived for treatment for a broken nose, a facial fracture and numerous broken teeth. Shmucker was reluctant to discuss what had happened with the medical staff, initially saying her attacker was female, according to Lancaster Online. She then went into Strasburg police station on Sunday and officially reported the assault. Schmucker told officers she was afraid to tell medical personnel who had beaten her because Williams stayed with her as she was being treated. After allegedly attacking girlfriend Esther Schmucker, Imir R. Williams drove her here, to Lancaster Regional Medical Center, to have her injuries treated. When asked by staff what happened, Schmucker told them her wounds were inflicted by a female because Williams was at her side at the time . Schmucker is one of the stars of Discovery series Amish Mafia, which is now in its second series. It is part documentary, part re-enactment drama about the Amish men who protect their clan in Pennsylvania .

Caroline Kennedy started her new role as U.S. ambassador to Japan on Monday and began with a visit to the Japanese Foreign Ministry for her first official meetings with diplomats. Kennedy arrived in Tokyo on Friday to take up the position bringing one important strength: She has the ear of the American president. 'I bring greetings from President Obama,' she said in a short statement after getting off the plane with her husband Edwin Schlossberg at Narita airport on Friday. Newly appointed U.S. ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy, shakes hands with Akitaka Saiki, Japan's Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, at the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo on Monday . Japan hopes the 55-year-old daughter of late President John F. Kennedy will work closely with Barack Obama to tackle some urgent U.S.-Japan matters, analysts said. Her close ties to Obama come from playing a pivotal role during the Democratic presidential primaries in 2008 by endorsing him when Hillary Clinton was the lead candidate. 'What's important here is her strong pipeline with Obama and an ability to be able to pick up the phone and speak with Obama directly in the middle of the night for consultation on urgent matters,' said Ryuichi Teshima, professor of diplomacy at Keio University in Tokyo. As the first woman to serve as U.S. ambassador to Japan, Kennedy may also be a role model in a country that traditionally has restricted the role of women, said Toshihiro Nakayama, professor of international politics at Aoyama Gakuin University. Caroline Kennedy was warmly welcomed on her arrival at the Narita International Airport in Tokyo on Friday . John F Kennedy's grandson John 'Jack' Schlossberg, left, with his mother Caroline Kennedy as she is sworn in as U.S. Ambassador to Japan with her husband Dr Edwin Schlossberg and Secretary of State John Kerry . 'I am also proud to carry forward my father's legacy of public service,' Kennedy said. 'He had hoped to be the first U.S. president to visit Japan. So it is a special honor for me to be able to work to strengthen the close ties between our two great countries.' U.S.-Japan relations are generally on an even keel, but Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are not as close as some would like. 'The chemistry is off, possibly because Obama does not support the right-wing views Abe holds,' Teshima said. Major bilateral issues include the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks, the relocation of a U.S. military base on Okinawa and a revamp of defense cooperation guidelines between the two countries. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the warm welcome Kennedy received on arrival in Tokyo 'is a wonderful display of the strong relationship between the United States and Japan.' Caroline Kennedy is escorted by Japan's Vice Foreign Minister Akitaka Saiki prior to their meeting at the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo on Monday . Tradition: Caroline Kennedy says she is looking forward to learning more about Japanese culture . Asked about Kennedy's lack of diplomatic experience, Psaki told reporters: 'I think she's displayed her commitment to working closely with Japan and working through all of the issues that we work together on. 'And she comes from a long line of public service. And we have no doubt she'll do an incredible job on the ground there.' U.S. ambassadors to Japan can be grouped into three categories, Nakayama said. They are big political names, Japan experts and those with close ties to the president. Former U.S. Vice President Walter Mondale and former Senator Mike Mansfield fall into the first type. Edwin Reischauer, President Kennedy's envoy, would be the second. Nakayama puts Caroline Kennedy, an attorney and author, in the third group, along with her predecessor, John Roos, a Silicon Valley lawyer and Obama fundraiser, and Tom Schieffer, who was George W. Bush's business partner in the Texas Rangers baseball team. Kennedy is the first woman to serve in the post.","Caroline Kennedy spent her first day as U.S. ambassador to Japan having official meetings at the Japanese Foreign Ministry .

To a person with dyslexia, the world of words and numbers can appear jumbled and confused. In a bid to try and explain exactly how dyslexics view pages in books, words on signs, and numbers, one sufferer has designed the ‘I wonder what it’s like to be dyslexic’ book. It shows how capitals can often get mixed up with lowercase letters, how words can become jumbled and the ways in which different fonts can affect how easy a word is to read. Scroll down to video .

In another shooting a 16-year-old girl was hit in the ankle along with two men aged 19 and 21, who were all taken to hospital in a stable condition. According to police the shooting, which happened on Sunday at around 1.15am, may have been gang related. Some of the most serious violence happened in 20 minutes on Sunday morning when one man was left in critical condition, and two more were reported to be in serious condition after being shot in a separate incident. In the first attack a 21-year-old was shot in the head in a drive-by attack at 2.10am while walking on the 1600 block of 46th Place. Around 20 minutes later a 33-year-old man was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital after being shot in the foot and back, while a 25-year-old was taken to Stroger Hospital after being shot in the back. A third 36-year-old was shot in the thigh and backside, but was in a stable condition. The trio had been standing in the street when two men jumped out of a car and opened fire with handguns, according to police reports. It is the second time in two months that the city has seen 18 people shot, while it is just four months since 30 were injured and six were killed including a seven-year-old boy . A fourth man was also in serious condition after being shot at around 4am on Saturday. The 21-year-old had been standing on the sidewalk after a party when he was hit in the left leg. The oldest victim of the violence was a 48-year-old who suffered a shoulder wound after being approached while trying to get into a property by two armed men. The three men grappled on the doorstep before the victim was shot in the shoulder and the thugs ran off. Another man was shot on Saturday night by a masked man, a second was shot early Sunday morning while out walking, and the two most recent victims were attacked at 4am on Sunday. News of the shootings follows on from the death of Javier Gonzalez, 17, a known gang member, whose unconscious body was found by police officers after being shot in the back of the head and shoulder on Thursday. The teenager was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in critical condition but died of his wounds on Friday afternoon. The recent spate of bloodshed marks the second weekend in two months where there have been 18 shootings on a single weekend in Chicago. On that occasion, between September 20 and 22, four people were killed and another 14 injured. According to data compiled by Redeye, there were an average of five murders per weekend in Chicago between 2007 and 2012.

Shakil Munir, of Middlesbrough, is one of four defendants accused of sexually exploiting a number of teenagers from the town . A taxi driver had underage sex with a 14-year-old schoolgirl in a layby and later told her mother he believed she was 16, a court heard today. Shakil Munir, of Middlesbrough, is one of four defendants accused of sexually exploiting a number of teenagers from the town. The prosecution alleged the Bradford-born 32-year-old picked up a 14-year-old girl and had sex with her in the early hours in a parking spot on the A19 after they sent each other explicit messages on Facebook. But he told a court nothing happened between them in his car and he insisted he thought she was 16. Late on one night in January, she asked Munir to pick her up and take her to the garage to buy cigarettes, but it was alleged he stopped in a lay-by where, the prosecution said, he got her to give him oral sex, then full intercourse. Munir told the jury of ten women and two men at Teesside Crown Court he thought the sexual messages between them on Facebook were 'banter'. The driver, then aged 31, believed she was 16, he told the court. Asked by his barrister Ekwall Tiwana why he got involved in the conversation, Munir who is twice-married said: 'To be honest with you, I was going through a bad patch and I was bored and I just started chatting.' He had recently picked up the girl and two of her friends and given them a free lift, the jury heard. He denied they had sex in his car when they stopped in a lay-by. He explained that she had wanted to talk and told him about her family life and her problems. Munir parked up and they talked, he said, but he denied having sex with the girl. That night, with the girl still in his car, Munir received a text from her mother, telling him to bring her home immediately or she would call the police. It was only when the mother said her daughter was 14 that he realised her age, he said. 'I thought she was 16,' he told the jury. In a later meeting with the mother, he told her: 'Your daughter told me she was 16.' Munir said he had an arranged marriage when he was 17, which lasted 'two to three years' and that he remarried in 2004 in Pakistan. He denies child abduction and five counts of having sex with a child. Munir - who denies having sex with the girl - told the jury of ten women and two men at Teesside Crown Court he thought the sexual messages between them on Facebook were 'banter' His co-accused, two 18-year-olds and a 17-year-old, also deny all the charges against them. At the close of the prosecution case, the jury was told police had received reports that attempts had been made to stop girls from giving evidence. Christopher Knox, prosecuting, asked Detective Inspector Dino Carlucci, who is in charge of the investigation: 'There were in the course of the investigation reports reaching the police that there were pressures upon girls at or about school, discouraging them from reporting events to the police or agreeing to give evidence.' Mr Carlucci replied: 'That is a fair summary.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Shakil Munir is one of four accused of sexually exploiting teenagers .

Two physicists have produced some tips for men hoping to avoid 'splashback' when using the toilet, by studying the physics of urinal usage. Using high-speed videos of a stream of simulated urine, the scientists pinpointed when men are at most risk of splashback and stressed the importance of 'good technique' when using urinals. Their research shows reduced splash can be achieved by aiming at a vertical surface, moving closer to the urinal and by decreasing the impact angle. Scroll down for videos . Physicists have explored the physics of weeing. They believe most of the splashback caused by male urination is because of 'Plateau-Rayleigh instability,' which means streams of falling liquid quickly turn into droplets (pictured at the beginning of the stream of simulated urine) In news that will not surprise cleaners and dry cleaners, physicists Todd Truscott and Randy Hurd, who call themselves the wizz kids, said that 'significant splashback' occurs when using a urinal. Writing on their blog at Utah-based Brigham Young University's Incompressible Fluids Lab, they said: 'The amount of splash is considerable and should make one reconsider standing up to urinate.'

A Tory MP has survived an attempt by Conservative ‘dinosaurs’ to de-select him after he admitted he was gay. Former Prisons Minister Crispin Blunt was reconfirmed as the candidate for Reigate and Banstead seat after allies launched ‘Operation Meteor’ - a reference to the prehistoric asteroid hit on earth that is credited with rendering the dinosaurs extinct. Mr Blunt won a five to one victory in a ballot of every Tory member in the constituency after members of the local party board attempted to oust him. He has held the seat since 1997 and won in 2010 with a majority of 13,500. His win was hailed as a triumph for Tory moderates last night as Mr Blunt’s critics readily admitted that his homosexuality and support for gay marriage had turned them against him. Mr Blunt revealed in 2010 that he had separated from his wife to ‘come to terms with his homosexuality’. Tony Collinson, a member of the Reigate party’s executive committee, would not reveal whether he had supported Mr Blunt, but said he thought homosexuality was wrong. ‘Everyone is entitled to their own view and we had a secret ballot on it and I don’t think I should make any comment,’ he said. ‘I can tell you that the selection committee was not happy to have anyone that might have had any sort of thing in the cupboard. Mr Blunt won public support from David Cameron and Michael Gove after he announced he was gay . ‘I’m a Christian and I don’t think in fact that [homosexuality] is right. But that is entirely up to people. They must search their own consciences.’ Another executive member, Roger Newstead, told a fellow Tory in a letter: ‘There is no doubt in my mind that [Mr Blunt’s] very public and totally unnecessary announcement that he was “gay” was the final straw for some members’. Mr Newstead said: ‘To me it was an error of judgment. You don’t have to go out and tell people you have got homosexual tendencies - that sort of thing you know. It is a private matter and it shouldn’t have been put in the public domain. He put it in the public domain.’ But Mr Blunt won public support from David Cameron, Michael Gove, Eric Pickles, Michael Howard and Boris Johnson. The MP said last night: ‘This is a triumphant vote for tolerance which critics outside the party might not have believed possible. 'It says a great deal about Reigate, and the vote reflects very well on both the community and the local party.’ Another figure in the local association said: ‘You can’t change people who are 75, 85, 90. They’ve got their own views from years ago.’ The case was reminiscent of another constituency spat when the so-called ‘Turnip Taliban’ in South West Norfolk sought to ban candidate Liz Truss over an affair she had years before with Tory MP Mark Field. She eventually won and is now an education minister.","Former Prisons Minister Crispin Blunt was reconfirmed as the candidate for Reigate and Banstead seat .

Hard times: Esther Rantzen, pictured, has said elderly people are 'discarded like rubbish' and thrown away . Coming home at the end of a busy day, Esther Rantzen puts the key into her front door and finds herself in a dark, empty flat. There is nobody for her to make a cup of tea for, nobody to ask her about her day and nobody to sit on the sofa with to watch TV. It is for the TV presenter a lonely time and has been since her husband, Desmond Wilcox, passed away 13 years ago. The 73-year-old, best known for presenting BBC television series That’s Life!, has admitted she has found it difficult to adapt to life on her own and knows she is not alone as yesterday she said older people are often treated like ‘discarded rubbish with a sell by date’. And with Christmas approaching, Miss Rantzen is only too aware that this is the loneliest time for some of the UK’s 10 million people now over 65. With this in mind she is rolling out The Silver Line, a 24-hour helpline service aimed at elderly people who are struggling to cope with loneliness, nationally on Monday November 25. Talking about her decision to set up the service she said in a new interview with the Radio Times: ‘Recently I received a letter from Ellen, clearly a clever woman who has brought up a family and held a responsible job, and yet who feels that in her old age “my days are pointless and I’m a waste of space”. ‘Reading it, I felt a surge of anger. Something must be done to assure our older population that they are valued. We must reach out to them, link them back into their communities, and convince them that older people are a resource, a national treasure. There must be no sell-by date, no moment when older people become rubbish to be discarded, thrown away. Loneliness is, according to the Department of Health, as dangerous physically as smoking or obesity. Mentally and emotionally, it is utterly destructive. ‘This is the generation that does not readily ask for help. They don’t want to be a burden. Loneliness is a creeping enemy, it isolates, erodes confidence, until it becomes more and more difficult to step outside the front door.’ Loneliness: Miss Rantzen lost her husband Desmond Wilcox, pictured, 13-years-ago and has struggled with life alone ever since . Miss Rantzen’s late husband, documentary-maker Mr Wilcox, died from heart disease in 2000. Their relationship began as an affair in 1968, when he was her head of department at the BBC. They married in 1977 and spent 30 years together until his death, aged 69, and had three children together. However, the presenter has been living on her own for the past two years after her youngest child Joshua, now 32, moved out. She sold the family home and now lives in a two bedroom flat in London. It was earlier this year that Miss Rantzen spoke of her own sadness at being a widow, saying she would give up a decade of her life to spend just ten more minutes by her late husband’s side. Miss Rantzen has also revealed she had . even once pleaded with her daughter Emily, 34, to move back in with her . in a bid to help her overcome her loneliness. However, she admitted it . never happened, adding ‘What was I thinking? She’s a young woman who . values her independence and has every right to live by herself.’ Family: Documentary maker Desmond Wilcox, who died from heart disease, with his wife and their children Emily, 4, Rebecca, 3, and Joshua, 2 . For Miss Rantzen loneliness is linked with loss, she states in her Radio Times piece: ‘The loss of a partner, of a job, of a neighbourhood, of friends.  ‘Some people are alone all their lives and never feel it. But Bob wrote to me: “I have just said goodbye to my wife who died of Alzheimer’s. It’s 65 years since we married, but more to the point, 72 since we first kissed. And she waited for me throughout the war, and I for her. Loneliness… tell me about it.”' Having successfully set up the . ChildLine telephone service, Miss Rantzen knew providing a similar . service for the eldery would prove just as invaluable. She . said: ‘ChildLine has shown that a helpline that’s free, safe and . confidential can transform lives. Over the last 27 years, 3.2 million . children have rung 0800 1111 and found the support and comfort they . desperately needed. Now we are launching a helpline for older people, . The Silver Line. We have been running a pilot service for the past year, . funded by Comic Relief. It has already transformed lives. As one . gentleman told us, “When I put the telephone down, I feel like I belong . to the human race.” Help at hand: The television presenter, pictured working at a ChildLine call centre, is launching 'Silver Line' - a helpline for the elderly - on November 25 . The Silver Line has been running as a pilot for a year but will now be available nationally. Callers will be provided with information, friendship and advice linking them with projects in their communities. Volunteers will also be trained up to become   Silver Line Friends, making regular calls to older people to talk, discuss their hopes and dreams, pick over the news and share views. Miss Rantzen added: ‘Our hope for the future is that The Silver Line will find its place in enriching older people’s lives, and counteracting loneliness, the most terrible poverty of all.’ Pensioners need to realise there is more to life than having a nice garden, an expert on ageing said yesterday. Tom Kirkwood, of Newcastle University, said that society was sidelining the elderly, leading to a ‘criminal waste’ of their knowledge and experience. But retirees who settle for ‘tending the roses’ also have to shoulder some responsibility. He said: ‘This is a massive personal resource that is being parked in the potting shed, or wherever.’","73-year-old said Christmas can be lonely for UK's 10 million people over 65 .

The watch, believed to be codenamed Gem, could take advantage of the work Google has been doing on its Glass wearable computer. It could also use the same Google Now alerts for directions and text messages as the eyewear. Google fansite 9to5Google has created a mock-up of what Google's Gem watch could look like with a circular or square design, pictured.The watch is expected to run the Google-owned operating system, Android and will show notifications on its solid screen . In August, Google bought smartwatch maker WIMM. WIMM makes an Android-based watch with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth built-in. It syncs with a smartphone and can show the phone's notifications on its fixed screen. The WIMM One comes with pre-installed Micro Apps, including a calendar that syncs with Google and Exchange, weather, timer, stopwatch, world clock, and alarm clock. In August, it was revealed the firm bought a company called WIMM, which makes a watch that runs on Google’s Android software. ‘Google could put a lot of the functionality of Google Glass in the watch product,’ claims Seth Weintraub of the 9to5Google website. ‘Push a button, ask a question, get a response as the watch talks to the Now-enabled smartphone. ‘Also, the ‘serendipitous’ information that Google Now shows you on your phone could come up in the watch. ‘Time to get home, Calendar alarms, emails, SMSes, etc. all could get pushed to the watch’s display.' Juniper research says the market will be huge for wearables, and grow by about 14 times - to $19 billion - by 2018, and claims smartwatches will be the big winners, with 36 million in global shipments by 2018. Google's Gem device could be launched to rival Samsung's Galaxy Gear, pictured, and Sony's SmartWatch 2. Google is already an established played in the wearable technology market thanks to its Google Glass device .

About a million will be shipped this year after both Sony and Samsung launched new watches. Apple is believed to also be preparing a watch, although it is not expected to reveal it until next year. However some experts believe it may be too early to launch a smartwatch. Tim Ryan of legal firm Davenport Lyons, said ‘Given the potential market and the rapid advances in technology, it’s likely that the early adopters will be disappointed at how quickly their new devices are replaced or become redundant.’ He also believe app makers could be crippled by the small screens needed to fit the gadget on a wrist. ‘Even though the technology is very impressive, and will get more so, there is still the issue of physical size and physical constraint, particularly with screen size,’ he added.","Rumours claim Google is working on a watch to be unveiled 'within weeks'

School officials in Northern California will meet this week to decision if they should ditch the ‘racist’ American Indian mascot of a local high school. District administrators will recommend that the school board approve changing Vallejo High's Apache mascot at Wednesday's board meeting. The mascot, first adopted decade ago, has long been a source of tension between people who believe it honors the Apache and those who feel it is offensive to American Indians. District administrators will meet this week to vote on dumping Vallejo High's Apache mascot, which critics argue is offensive to American Indians . The contentious issue was raised two weeks ago during the school’s last board meeting. Supporters of both points of view spilled out of the crammed board meeting and into the hallways and an overflow space of the district office, reports The Vallejo Times Herald. During the section for public comments, most speakers spoke in favor of changing the mascot because of the offense it causes to some indigenous people. ‘What you're doing - using native images and native names - it's racist, it's demeaning,’ Local resident Karen Doris Wright told the board. Coachella Valley High School has been criticized for their team's name the 'Arabs' and for their 'stereotypical' mascot who makes appearances at school sporting events and dances along with high school cheerleaders . Despite the urging of mascot opponents during that session, board members couldn’t make a decision since the item wasn’t on the agenda. A staff report by Vallejo City Unified School District says the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights recommends avoiding the use of Native American images and nicknames. The report does not offer a specific replacement for the Apache mascot, but officials say the school will likely retain its colors even if the board approves the mascot change. A large number of schools have already changed their mascots in acknowledgement of the sensitivities surrounding the use of the word Apache. There remain 14 high schools that still have Apache mascots in the United States, according to maxpreps.com, a website that tracks high school sports teams. Washington's NFL team, the 'Redskins' has also come in for concerted pressure from Native American activists and a few media outlets, along with President Barack Obama, to change its name . This latest controversy follows hot on the heels of a similar story in Southern California, where school officials at Coachella Valley High School are under fire from anti-discrimination groups for their team's name the 'Arabs' and for their 'stereotypical' mascot. School officials say that they will consider changing their mascot but that their team name will remain. School superintendent Daryl Adams said that the team name the 'Arabs' has been in place ever since the 1920s. During a meeting with the school board on Friday night, Adams said he would meet with the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee sometime this week to address their concerns. The Committee sent a letter to the school complaining that the mascot was a stereotypical portrayal of Arab culture.

"By . Petronella Wyatt . PUBLISHED: . 17:47 EST, 13 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:47 EST, 13 November 2013 . My former sister-in-law's ideas about bringing up children have never tallied with mine. I won't forget the morning Caroline phoned me in a fury, asking: 'What do you think you were doing with my daughter? She came home with alcohol on her breath. She says you bought her lobster for dinner.' 'I'm her aunt,' I replied defensively. 'I thought it would be good for the growing-up process.' She refused to be mollified. Lucky: Petronella's nieces Genevra and Antonella . 'But Antonella is just 14,' she shrieked. 'Now she'll want to go to expensive restaurants all the time. What do you think you're doing? It's just too much!' But of course! Doing too much for our nieces and nephews is what we Panks - a new acronym devised by sociologists meaning Professional Aunts, No Kids - do best. Just like one in five women in Britain, I've passed the age of 40 without having had children. Combined with the fact that the nuclear family is splitting and reconfiguring itself into a bewildering number of shapes, Panks like me have come into their own. We are constant, indulgent and have bank accounts that have not been drained by the financial exigencies of bringing up children. Moreover, we have a surplus of free time and maternal love to lavish on nieces and nephews. Celebrity Panks such as actresses Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston, who are both childless, reiterate the mantra of Pank philosophy. Says Miss Diaz, 41, of her three nieces: 'I spoil them rotten. Whatever they want, they get. I cannot resist them.' It is no wonder we have become a source of irritation to mothers. Pank: Petronella is a new kind of woman, the Professional Aunt, No Kids . In the universe of Panks, there are good Panks and naughty Panks. Since my two nieces, Genevra and Antonella, were born, I have been regarded by my former sister-in-law as an X‑rated Pank. My brother Nicholas is much older than myself (I am 42 and he is 60) and when my first niece, Genevra, was born, I was only 18. She and her younger sister Antonella, who was born two years later, tugged at my heart strings from the minute they entered the world. Then, they were an unconscious substitute for the children yet to be born to me; later, as the years passed, they became a symbol of the children I might not have. Now, they are the closest thing to children I will ever get. Throughout their lives, in order to win their affection, I have resorted to a tactic that is typical of Panks, and the bane of so many mothers' lives: I have practised shameless one-upmanship. Nevertheless, I was determined to be the adult female they'd look forward to seeing at family events. While their mother scolded and performed the unpleasant tasks involved in raising children, I was keen to be a cross between a fairy godmother and a three ringed-circus; a never-ending source of fun, gifts, holidays and introductions that would make their peers break out in hives of envy. It was Pankdemonium. When my nieces were four and six, I bought indoor fireworks to entertain them at Christmas dinner at my then sister-in-law's house in Hammersmith. The set cost £100. It contained miniature volcanoes, Roman candles, spluttering snakes and exploding bombs. I shall never forget Caroline's face as the fireworks and their explosive debris did their worst to her recently redecorated dining room. The children and I collapsed in giggles. My sister-in-law, who looked as if she had been turned into granite, pointedly called me a minicab. After that, family dinners were transferred to my father's larger and more substantial house in North London, where I continued my Pankish ways. When the girls were 11 and 13, I started to shower them with clothing from Chanel. 'And where do you think they are going to wear that?' asked my sister-in-law. Antonella, to my great pride, had just won a place at my alma mater, St Pauls's Girls School in Hammersmith, which had no uniform. 'To school,' I replied blithely. Caroline began to choke. Celebrity Panks: Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston, both childless, endorse the Pank philosophy. Of her three nieces, Diaz says, 'I spoil them rotten' As the greatest Pank in English literature, Auntie Mame, says in the eponymous novel by Patrick Dennis, which chronicles the adventures of a boy growing up in the care of his eccentric aunt: 'Life is a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death.' Panks, on the other hand, promise indulgence, largesse - and delicious food. Auntie Mame, who was based on a real-life Pank, gets into trouble with her censorious relatives when she gives her 12-year-old nephew waffles flambéed with champagne while lounging on a chaise longue in a low-cut evening dress. I have managed to top even that. I started my nieces on the bubbly when they were about the same age. I would sneak glasses of wine to them when I thought no one was looking. On the evening of their confirmation (the girls were then 13 and 15), I arrived at the church wearing a figure-hugging catsuit. At the dinner afterwards, in the private room of a sedate restaurant, my nieces, demure in their smart frocks, were encouraged by me to get wildly tipsy. We ended up wrestling on the floor. I am lucky enough to have a contacts book that includes the names of well-known people. When, a while ago, I told my nieces I was going to have breakfast with the handsome actor Leonardo DiCaprio at the Dorchester Hotel, they begged for signed photographs - which I gleefully provided. 'The coolest Panks are often the maddest Panks.' I engineered an introduction to musical impressario Andrew Lloyd Webber. Four years ago I interviewed Roger Moore and sneaked my 13-year-old Bond-obsessed godson into the room. Readers may look askance at these admissions, imagining that I was trying to buy the love I was unable to expend on my own, unborn children. In part, this has been true. Not having children is an irrevocable sadness. I simply never met the right man at the right time. Though I have been engaged twice, on both occasions I decided not to make the trip to the altar. So it is fair to say nieces and nephews can become child substitutes - and, in my case, expensive ones at that. According to a global marketing research firm, Panks are spoiling their nieces and nephews to the tune of £6 billion a year, a figure which doesn't surprise me. One childless girlfriend of mine spent £10,000 in one year taking her 15-year-old niece on luxury holidays to the Maldives, Italy and St Moritz, knowing the child's own mother could not afford expensive vacations abroad. Such was her need to fill the childless void that, during these outings, she encouraged the girl to call her 'Mummy'. This takes Panking too far. I have never attempted consciously to be a replacement mother to my nieces, or to alienate them from their own. Grown-up: Genevra (pictured at her graduation) and Antonella have completed their education, but Petronella's antics are still favourite subjects for their anecdotes . While I've loved taking Antonella and Genevra out for lobster dinners after school, or for £20 lychee martinis at trendy new bars, it hasn't always been Pank pranks. I have also given advice on school work, helped them write essays and listened to accounts of their travails with young men, knowing they would speak freely to me in the way they couldn't to their mother. Children listen to Panks because they are the first grown-ups with whom they become friends. I have been frank with my nieces about sex, illegal substances and the difficulties young people today face. I have admitted that I once tried cocaine and that I found it a senseless, dangerous experience. I have told them what I know about the ways of men - and women - which, admittedly, is not very much judging by my chequered personal history. I have told them when I think they are getting too thin or, occasionally, overweight. But when a Pank criticises, the  sting is softened by humour and a pretence of eccentricity. Not that my nieces and godchildren believe the latter to be a pretence. For the coolest Panks are often the maddest Panks. My nieces, now 22 and 24, have completed their education and are starting out in professions.

The babysitter is booked, my little black dress has been dry-cleaned and several pairs of killer heels lie scattered on the bedroom floor. Carefully applying oxblood red varnish to my nails, I struggle to recall when I last took so much time and trouble getting ready for a night out. But I have waited too long for this date to rush things and risk stepping out in the wrong outfit. Tonight, I want to look fabulous. Because tonight, I'm meeting my ex-husband's new girlfriend for the first time. As I walk into the restaurant, my ex, Francesco, and his new lover are already there. As she smiles and offers her hand, I'm struck by how similar we look - she is slightly fairer, but we are the same age and build. She's wearing a little black dress, too. I notice her looking at Francesco as I once did almost 20 years ago when we first met at an English language school in Italy. She is bubbly, attentive and excited to be with him. Francesco's physical renaissance is inescapable, too. The weight he'd gained in the last stale years of our marriage has melted away. He has new Prada glasses and is sporting sharp new threads. As I watch him unable to take his eyes off her, I try to pinpoint the emotion I'm feeling. Jealousy? Bitterness? Grief for the remnants of our 15-year marriage? Not a bit of it. In fact, all I feel is unmitigated joy. I could cartwheel across the room with happiness. I'm delighted that my former husband has finally found love again two and a half years after our divorce. Eighteen months ago I, too, fell head over heels with a new man. In fact, Steve accompanies me on this date to the restaurant and the four of us share a lovely evening. But rewind three years and the thought of actually wanting to spend time with Francesco was inconceivable. We first met in Sicily while I was teaching English, and Francesco - who was a year older than me at 29 - was one of my pupils: a sharp dresser with movie-star sunglasses and a keen intellect. We fell for each other and moved to Britain in 1997, setting up home in North London. For the first few years we were very happy. Francesco was fun and we had a great social life. But like many long-term relationships, our marriage had started straining at the seams once we'd had our (much wanted and deeply loved) children. Brawls about housework, childcare and bringing home enough bacon eroded the love we had once shared. Our arguments were all about the marital division of labour - I felt I was doing the lion's share. In the end, our rows became so unpleasant, so frequent and so personal that I asked for a separation in November 2009. And the aftermath of our split was unusual in that when Francesco left the family home on May 1, 2010, he also left the country. He returned to his native Italy where, a couple of months before our separation, he had landed his dream job as a project manager for an architect. Young love: The writer and Francesco in the mid nineties . Finally, I was on my own, and it was such a relief not to have to nag him about the dirty socks under the bed and stubble in the sink. Far from feeling lonely, I felt wonderful waking up without him. But I was also left feeling terribly sad for my daughter and son, then nine and two. When I planned my family, this was not how I imagined the plot would turn out, and I felt guilty that Francesco and I had failed at our marriage. From the outset, we agreed that when Francesco visited the children every couple of months, he would stay with us. He no longer had a home in Britain and I didn't want their precious daddy-time to be spent in anonymous B&Bs and fast food outlets. It was emotionally important for our beloved children to see that the two people who had brought them into the world could actually be in the same room without biting each other's heads off. But I cannot pretend that I enjoyed Francesco's visits. They were a hard exercise in civility and restraint - and having him back in my home reminded me of the mountain of irritations behind our failed marriage. 'I had moved on, which was wonderful for me, but cannot have been easy for Francesco, and I felt a scintilla of sympathy for him' Why couldn't he read a bedtime story without falling asleep before the children? Why did he spend so much time mouldering on the sofa? I'm sure Francesco had his own simmering irritations - even if, for the children's sake, we were careful not to let them bubble over into actual rows. While married, he'd always accused me of nagging and that I didn't know how to relax. On the rare moments we found ourselves in a room without the children, it certainly felt awkward. That awkwardness became even more acute when, two years after our separation, I met Steve. Suddenly, a new and exciting chapter had opened in my life. I had moved on, which was wonderful for me, but cannot have been easy for Francesco, and I felt a scintilla of sympathy for him. It wasn't as if I could hide my new man on my ex's visits. Steve lives in the same North London mansion block as me - a friend joked that I'd ended up with a 56-year-old boy-next-door. A couple of months into our relationship, he was keen to be formally introduced to my former husband - to 'be clear and straight about things'. But I held back. Even though I was confident Francesco was glad we had separated, the tensions between us were still palpable. Openly parading my new man would have felt like rubbing salt into a not-quite-healed wound. Francesco and I were friendly in a perfunctory sort of way, but we were definitely not friends. On good terms: Bruce Willis with his wife, Emma Hemming, left, is still friends with his first wife, Demi Moore, right, with whom he has children including daughter Tallulah Belle Willis, second from right . But then, one magic weekend six months ago, everything changed. It was one of Francesco's visits to see the children, and the minute he walked through the door I knew things were different. For what felt like the first time in years, he smiled at me properly and bent down and gave me a continental peck on the cheek. It was surprising and lovely in equal measure. He looked great. He'd slimmed down and was wearing smart new clothes. One word sprang to mind: girlfriend. Later that night, when the children were in bed, Francesco confirmed my happy suspicions. My ex had a new woman, an architect who also lived in Italy. He wasn't sure how long it would last, but he was very keen on her. 'I know,' I said. 'Your whole being is grinning.' And I really did know. It was a familiar grin. I'd undergone a similar renaissance in the early weeks of my relationship with Steve when I'd finally lost my baby weight, bought new lingerie - the kind favoured by French politicians' mistresses - and starting paying for aggressive depilation. I can genuinely say I felt nothing but delight for Francesco. These days, he and I grin a lot more at each other, too, and it feels so good. After years of sniping and nastiness, our children sense their parents' genuine friendship, their pleasure in each other's company. Split ends . The number of couples who divorce has been falling since reaching a peak of 165,000 in 1993 . But I am not deluding myself. My offspring would no doubt be cheerier still if their mother and father were happily married. Yet, given that we aren't, we are surely in a better place than we were. In a society where 42 per cent of marriages end, many of them with children in the equation, friendship between exes is surely the way forward. It is obviously far more pleasant for everyone if former spouses get on. What's strange is that I never really thought I could be one of those former spouses. I always wanted to be good friends with Francesco, but deep down I feared the conventional wisdom was probably right: you can't really be proper friends with someone who has seen you naked. Indeed, when my divorced friends told me they got on brilliantly with their exes and that all the rancour had gone, I was sceptical. But thinking about them now, I realise they all have one crucial thing in common: they all have new partners. They are on an equal footing. Like me and my ex - he's happy, I'm happy. We can both start again. I now see that one of the biggest casualties of our relationship was respect. I had stopped admiring the man mouldering on the sofa, the snoring form in bed with whom I'd shared a marriage and a mortgage for more years than I wanted to remember, and had started taking him for granted. And I would say he had done exactly the same with me. Now when I see him smiling at his new lover, my only thought is: 'Good on you, my friend. I wish you every happiness in the world.'","Karen and Francesco were married for 15 years and had two children .

U.S. teens seeking weight-loss surgery have a startling number of health problems that used to be seen only in adults, according to a major government-funded study. Half the teens had at least four major illnesses linked with their excess weight. Three out of four had cholesterol problems; almost half had high blood pressure or joint pain; and many had diseased livers or kidneys. These kids weighed three times more than what is considered healthy, they weren't just teens ‘who want to fit into that cheerleading outfit better,’ said Dr. Thomas Inge, the study's lead researcher and a surgeon at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Scroll down for video . Teenage girl gets a medical exam in preparation for gastric bypass surgery: A new Government-funded study has found that surgery is perfectly safe for severely obese teens . The study offers reassuring evidence that obesity surgery is generally safe for teens, echoing previous short-term research. While it is a drastic, last-ditch option, major complications including accidental injury to internal organs occurred in just eight percent of teens. Less serious complications including bleeding and dehydration affected 15 percent of kids during the first month after surgery. The study involved 242 teens who had surgery at five U.S. centers from 2007 through 2011. Results for the first month after surgery were released online on Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. The National Institutes of Health paid for the study. In a recent scientific statement, the American Heart Association said obesity surgery may be the most effective treatment for what it called ‘severe obesity’ in teens, a condition it said affects about five percent of U.S. children and is increasing nationwide. Half of the teens surveyed had at least four major illnesses linked to their excess weight including high cholesterol, high blood pressure, joint pain, diseased livers and kidneys . The group's threshold for severe obesity is a body mass index of at least 35; the average BMI in the study was 51. Because lifestyle changes and medication rarely work for such obese teens, the statement says obesity surgery should be considered for those with related health problems who are psychologically mature enough to handle it. The new results bolster evidence from smaller studies in teens and also suggest teens may do better, at least initially, than adults. Earlier 30-day research in adults found a few deaths after obesity surgery, although the risk was no greater than for other major operations. There were no deaths in the teen study. A three-year follow-up report on more than 2,000 patients in the adult study was also published online Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Chelsea Hale holds a photo of herself made three years ago at the age of 17 before she had obesity surgery, in Fairfield, Ohio. Hale had weighed 314 pounds and is now about 170 pounds . It showed adults generally had fewer obesity-related illnesses than in the teen study, and most weight loss occurred within the first year after surgery. Gastric bypass surgery, the most common operation in the U.S., resulted in more weight loss and more improvement in related illnesses than stomach banding, as other studies have shown. Three-year death rates were low, and similar for both procedures, but band patients had many more repeat surgeries. In the teen study, whether obesity surgery resulted in lasting weight loss and better health remains to be seen; the researchers are still following the participants and calculating data. But anecdotal reports from the teens suggest they're doing pretty well. Chelsea Hale of Cincinnati has shrunk from 314 to 170 pounds - almost half her previous size - since having surgery three years ago at age 17 at Cincinnati Children's. Before surgery, Chelsea Hale had a hormonal problem, heart blockage and sleep apnea - all linked with obesity and all have since subsided since her surgery . Before surgery, Hale had a hormonal problem, heart blockage and sleep apnea - all linked with obesity and all have since subsided. ‘I feel good, I can pretty much physically do anything,’ said Hale, now in nursing school. Like 28 percent of the teens studied, she had gastric sleeve surgery, which involves removing part of the stomach and creating a smaller tube or sleeve-shaped stomach. She has to be careful about eating only small portions of foods, to avoid getting sick, but said otherwise she has no food restrictions. Some teens in the study say they can no longer tolerate certain foods, including sugar, meat or dairy products. Most teens had gastric bypass or stomach stapling, which creates a small pouch in the stomach and attaches it to the intestines. A handful had gastric band operations, in which surgeons position an adjustable band around the top of the stomach, and inflate it to shrink the stomach. This operation has not been approved for U.S. teens. The results of the new survey bolster existing evidence that suggest teens may do better - at least initially - than adults after having obesity surgery (file pic) Inge, a pioneer in obesity surgery in teens, says he does about 30 to 40 operations each year at Cincinnati Children's and the numbers have increased slightly in recent years. Kids must be severely obese to qualify. But many are so large that even when surgery results in substantial weight loss and better health, they can't shrink their BMI to below the obese range, Inge said. That underscores the need to find ways to prevent severe obesity, he said. University of Colorado heart specialist Dr. Robert Eckel, an American Heart Association spokesman, said the study shows obesity surgery should be considered a reasonable approach for kids, but that the study results may represent a best-case scenario, since surgeons involved were all highly experienced. Parents seeking obesity surgery for their teens should have them evaluated in centers that do lots of these operations, he said.","Government-funded study found that obesity surgery is safe for teens .

Fine: Andrew Gardiner has been convicted of threatening fellow councillor Mike Weston and fined £200 . A councillor has been fined for telling an election rival he would 'knock his block off' in a furious rant after losing at the polls. Andrew Gardiner threatened to kill fellow councillor Mike Welton and jabbed a finger at his face as bystanders looked on. But despite being convicted of using threatening words or behaviour, he insisted he had 'no regrets' about the incident and refused to resign as a councillor in Wymondham, Norfolk. Gardiner and Mr Welton both sit as independents on the town council, and were standing for Norfolk County Council during the local elections in May this year. When Gardiner was defeated by Conservative candidate Joseph Mooney, he launched an angry tirade at Mr Welton, accusing him of deliberately splitting the independent vote to keep him out of office. The councillor denied using threatening words or behaviour, but was found guilty at Norfolk Magistrates' Court yesterday. Gardiner, 51, was fined £250 and ordered to pay a £25 victim surcharge plus £200 in costs. Mr Welton told the court: 'He said I was a disgrace to Wymondham. He told me he was going to get me, he was going to knock my block off.' Jack Hornby said he was standing with a group of Conservative councillors outside Long Stratton leisure centre, where the vote count took place, at the time of the rant. He said that Gardiner repeatedly jabbed a finger at Mr Welton, intimidating him and forcing him to step backwards, and added that Gardiner threatened to 'kill' his rival. Oliver Haswell, prosecuting, said the defendant had 'lost his self-control, reacted appallingly in the circumstances and used threatening abusive words or behaviour towards Mr Welton'. Town: The two men are both councillors in the Norfolk town of Wymondham, whose abbey church is pictured here. The altercation happened outside Long Stratton leisure centre, in Norfolk . Gardiner insisted he had been provoked by Mr Welton and said he was under severe stress at the time of the row. 'I had four weeks and a day of being goaded by him,' he told magistrates. 'I had just had pneumonia and a friend had died. 'I was wound up by him. At some point you have to react - I've never turned the other cheek.' Last night, Mr Welton spoke of his relief that Gardiner had been convicted, saying: 'Threatening behaviour is a very serious offence. 'The verdict sends out a clear message to anyone contemplating this type of behaviour that the authorities will not tolerate it.' But Gardiner claimed he had done nothing wrong and again blamed his rival for the incident, insisting he would not resign from his position. 'I have always maintained that I did not threaten Mr Welton with violence,' he said. 'I think the magistrates' sentence reflects they did have some sympathy towards me. 'I have no regrets about what I said to Welton. But I deeply apologise to people in Wymondham for allowing myself to be goaded into reacting.'","Andrew Gardiner launched tirade at fellow town councillor Mike Weston .

A Dallas-area man was sentenced to death Saturday for killing his children's baby sitter to prevent her from testifying that he raped her. Franklin Davis,31, admitted in court to killing 16-year-old Shania Gray, describing how he lured her into his car outside her school, shot her, stepped on her throat, and dumped her body in a river in September 2012. He left his disposable cell-phone that he'd used to lure her, his shoes, and the gun in a pond and in a drainage ditch reports Dallas News. But he said he killed her out of revenge and hatred, not to obstruct the sexual assault case that was nearing trial. Scroll Down For Video . Franklin Davis killed his children's babysitter after she claims that he raped her when she was 14-yaers-old . Shania Gray, 16, was a straight A student and she had a beautiful singing voice . A Dallas jury convicted Davis of capital murder Tuesday before sentencing him to death. Gray was remembered as a vivacious, friendly girl who often played basketball in the family driveway. Most people did not know that she was at the center of the sexual assault case against Davis. Her mother told police in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite that Davis sexually assaulted Gray while she was baby-sitting his children. The Dallas News reports that the girl says Davis raped her when she was 14-years-old. Davis, known by the nickname 'Wish,' exposed himself and had sex with the girl four separate times in 2011, according to a police affidavit. Franklin Davis, 31, was shocked to hear the verdict that he would be placed on death row . A photo of Shania with her mother Sherry, who is relieved her daughter's murderer will be put to death . Davis continued to deny the allegations at his trial. 'She lied,' Davis said on the stand, according to Dallas television station KTVT. 'She ruined my life. She took everything from me, everything I work so hard to get. She took it.' In the days before he killed Gray, Davis called and sent her text messages pretending to be a boy and asking her questions about the sexual assault case. He also reportedly sent himself fake texts denying the sexual assault allegations that appeared to come from Shania’s phone . The day of the killing, Gray got a text message saying her new friend 'D' was outside her school to surprise her. Davis' defense attorneys argued he was trying to do his own investigation after police did not. But prosecutors scoffed at that notion. 'You know it, I know it and he knows it,' prosecutor Russell Wilson told jurors, according to The Dallas Morning News. His persecutors reminded the jury of Davis' his repeated assaults of women and his assault of a guard when he escaped while in custody . They did this to show that he is a future danger reported the Dallas News.

The study revealed that while many may be quick to insist they are avid viewers of high-brow programmes like Newsnight, it's actually the antics of the TOWIE cast and lure of conflict and emotional drama of Jeremy Kyle that have viewers hooked. Other guilty pleasures include tea-time drama Hollyoaks and Strictly Come Dancing. Brits are also keeping their love of Storage Hunters secured tightly as the show where treasure seekers bid on garages full of junk made the top ten. The report found that the average TV viewer clocks up over 25 hours of television in an average week - more than 1,266 hours a year - which may explain why over a third said they love nothing more than a night in front of the box.

Giuseppe 'Joe' Giudice, the husband of Real Housewives of New Jersey star Teresa Giudice, still owes his former business partner $260,000 for his part in a 2007 mortgage scam. Joe Mastropole has never seen a cent of the cash a judge ordered Giudice to pay after he forged Mastropole's signature on a mortgage document. Speaking in the wake of Giuseppe and Teresa Giudice's indictment on 39 counts of fraud and tax evasion, Mastropole said that he had never expected to get any of the money because the couple's income was 'fraudulent, untraceable and untaxed.'

Murray for more than a minute, discussing his recent back surgery and a letter . the Duchess of Cambridge had sent him. The former US Open champion said he was surprised they had spoken for so long as he was told the handover would only take around 15 seconds.

'I teased him a bit as he had sent me a note to me before Wimbledon wishing me luck and his wife had written me a letter afterwards.

Prince Harry has been pictured on a late-night snack run to fast-food chicken chain Nando's. The royal was spotted at the restaurant outlet in Fulham, following England's World Cup qualification against Poland on Tuesday night. According to onlookers, a casually dressed Harry - wearing baseball cap, jeans and T-shirt - ordered a chicken breast fillet in lemon and herb sauce, cheese, and a side order of mashed potato. Chicken royale... The Fullham Broadway franchise of Nandos Restaurant, where Prince Harry bought a meal and drinks with friends . He also ordered a double chicken breast wrap with medium spice and chips, the Daily Mirror reports. The bill came to around £24, staff said. The prince apparently placed the order at around 11.50pm, and spent the next few minutes playing with his mobile phone. He was joined by a friend and his . personal security team at the restaurant until they picked up the order . shortly after midnight and left, exiting through a car park. It is not the first time the prince has been spotted at Nando's. In 2009, he was spotted at an outlet in Stevenage alongside his army colleagues. Harry was clearly looking to burn off some of the calories today as he took to the rugby pitch to put some young players through their paces at Twickenham. Working off the calories: Prince Harry joined a rugby union coaching session at Twickenham Stadium today . The Patron of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) All Schools Programme delivered a training session alongside RFU coaching staff on the Rugby pitch, before heading inside the stadium to meet young people . The fourth in line to the throne is a man of many talents, as he is a qualified rugby coach, and he was challenged to show his talent by England World Cup winner Jason . Robinson, who joked that the prince could be in line for a call-up to . the national squad. But Harry, 29, replied: 'I think I'm a bit past it already.' The All Schools programme aims to . expand rugby into 750 state schools as part of the legacy of England . hosting the 2015 World Cup. Robinson, . who went to state schools in Leeds and represented Great Britain at . rugby league before switching codes and captaining the England rugby . union side, gave Harry a pair of the same type of white and red boots he . wore as an international to take part in the coaching session on .

'I can't guarantee that they'll get you into the England team but you'll go quick,' said Robinson. Changing into the boots, Harry stripped off his tracksuit and put his expensive designer watch inside a training shoe. 'No one's going to nick my watch?' he asked an aide, before having second thoughts and handing it to him for safekeeping. 'Keep an eye on that one,' he said cheekily gesturing toward Robinson. Prince Harry jostles for the ball against former England rugby union player Jason Robinson as he took part in the RFU All Schools Programme . Harry gets locked into a tough tackle with the player, who determinedly grapples with the Prince . After the game Robinson, looking over at the Prince , said: 'He's dripping with sweat.

On the pitch, the pair trained groups of boys and girls from schools around the country. 'Pass the ball, pass,' shouted Harry. 'Get Jason. Seriously, I'm knackered.' He has too many other commitments these days to be able to play the game regularly. Robinson, looking over at the Prince later, said: 'He's dripping with sweat. He's put everything into this.'

An artist saw her weight drop to just 5st 7lb because she was terrified that all food was going to poison her. Samantha Brown, 27, was eventually diagnosed with an unusual form of obsessive compulsive disorder. Her chronic anxiety, an effect of an obsessive compulsion to control her food intake, caused her weight to shrink dangerously low, to the horror of her family and friends. Recovered: Samantha Brown's weight plummeted to to 5st 7lb because she thought basic foods were poisoning her. She was later diagnosed with a rare form of obsessive compulsive disorder and now weighs a healthy 9st 7lb having undergone therapy . Miss Brown was working as a freelance fashion stylist when her OCD began to manifest itself. She said: 'I was incredibly stressed, doing a job that I hated. The recession had hit and the work was drying up. 'I was working so hard to make something of my freelance career, which involved a lot of rejection. I felt as if I had no control. 'I began dictating to myself what I could and couldn’t eat. As my behaviour developed, it became an OCD, where I thought practically everything was poison. 'It was all rooted in my desire for control.' Decline: Samantha pictured while she was rapidly losing weight. Her chronic anxiety, an effect of an obsessive compulsion to control her food intake, meant she only ate Coco Pops, salt and vinegar crisps and pizza . While OCD is treated as an entirely . separate condition to eating disorders such anorexia and bulimia, it is . known that patients with OCD tend to experience eating disorders more . severely. Miss Brown, of Leicester, suspects her paranoia that food was harming her was made worse by the fact that she also suffers from ME, which causes chronic fatigue. Shrinking: Samantha says her eating habits were rooted in her desire for control . Miss Brown said: 'I didn’t want to be thin. I wasn’t avoiding eating to stay skinny. 'Instead, I was convinced that unless I restricted myself to the foods I had decided were OK, I would poison myself. 'I drew up an ""allowed"" list and a ""forbidden"" list. Before long, the ""allowed"" list had just three things - Coco Pops, salt and vinegar crisps, and thin-crust pizza. 'Eventually, all I could manage was Coco Pops. My mum became really concerned. She would try to tempt me with new foods like macaroni cheese, but all I could do was sob into the plate, pleading with her and warning her that it would kill me.' At her lowest ebb in the spring of 2012, Miss Brown, who is 5ft 8in, weighed just 5st 7lb. The physical and emotional exertion was so great that she contemplated suicide. She said: 'I thought I was being an enormous burden on my parents, and I didn’t know whether I would ever get better. I couldn’t see any way out.' An appointment with her GP finally put her anxieties in context and, after an intensive course of cognitive behavioural therapy, she finally began to put on weight. She said: 'I stood on the scales and the doctor said, ""if you lose another half a stone, your organs are going to fail"". It was a wake-up call. 'When the doctor diagnosed me with OCD I was surprised because I thought I would be described as having a simple eating disorder. 'It never occurred to me that my . behaviour - my systematic approval and disapproval of foods - was . compulsive. 'But once I heard that I had OCD, it all started to make . sense. 'He said it was rare for OCD to have . the effect it had on me, but not unknown. He had seen two other women in . a similar situation over the course of his career.' Now Miss Brown, who exhibits art all over London, weighs a healthy 9st 7lb and maintains a balanced, varied diet. She said: 'I want to help other people who are struggling with OCD issues, if only by raising awareness about the different forms the condition can take.' Well-known symptom: Sufferers of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder carry out repetitive and ritualistic actions, such as washing hands . Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is an anxiety-based condition, characterised by the sufferer having uncontrolled intrusive thoughts that dictate their actions, moods and fears. The disorder is often depicted incorrectly in films and on television, where the sufferer has endearing or 'amusing' ritualistic behaviour. This depiction underplays the debilitating and often alienating nature of the condition. It affects children, adolescents and adults. The majority of sufferers display symptoms from an early age. The most well-known symptom of OCD includes the continuous and obsessive washing of hands, sometimes until the skin is irritated and feels raw. Other common symptoms include: repetitive rituals such as closing doors in a specific way, or repeatedly checking locks or appliances; hoarding; preoccupation with violent, religious or sexual thoughts; and aversion to particular numbers, words or objects. OCD sufferers can appear paranoid and even psychotic, and they can suffer emotional stress from the resulting breakdown in relationships at work and in their private lives. Worse still, many sufferers are aware that their actions appear irrational, leading to further anxiety. Suicide rates in sufferers is high, and more than 50 per cent of sufferers experience suicidal tendencies. Despite its irrational nature, OCD has been associated with above-average intelligence - both share personality traits such as high attention to detail, meticulous planning and a higher than normal sense of responsibility. People suffering from OCD can have related disorders, such as bipolar disorder, anorexia nervosa, Tourette syndrome, Aspergers syndrome, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and dermatillomania (skin picking) and trichotillomania (hair pulling). Famous sufferers include: Dr Samuel Johnson, retrospectively diagnosed because of his ritualistic behaviour of counting stairs and crossing doorway thresholds in a specific way; actress Cameron Diaz, who says she is irrationally terrified by the transmission of germs - especially from doorknobs; singer Justin Timberlake, who admits that certain foods must be present in his fridge at all times; Leonardo DiCaprio, who used his childhood OCD as inspiration when he played fellow sufferer Howard Hughes in The Aviator; and footballer David Beckham, who has said he must count his clothes and arrange books and magazines in straight lines.","Samantha Brown, 27, was eventually diagnosed with unusual form of OCD .

The trial of accused 9/11 terrorists held in Guantanamo Bay won’t officially begin for a year, but lawyers on both sides are already complaining about unprecedented challenges in what is the largest war crimes tribunal since the Second World War. Defense lawyers for men accused of helping kill thousands of Americans on September 11 call the trial an unjust charade and claim the CIA has illegally monitored meetings between them and their clients, even going so far as to use a fake smoke detector without even the prosecution’s knowledge. Chief prosecutor Army Brigadier General Mark Martins said he was swamped by untrue accusations that his evidence did not count because much of it was obtained during advanced interrogation like waterboarding. Justice? Lawyers for three of the 9/11 defendants say the trial has become a charade before it has even begun . ‘This is not a system that is set up to deliver justice,’ David Nevin, the attorney for the admitted mastermind of 9/11 Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, told 60 Minutes for their segment about the upcoming trial, which aired Sunday. Mr Nevin claims his client was waterboarded 183 times in a single month. While Mr Nevin filed a declaration that showed how his client had been treated, and under what conditions he confessed, the declaration had been censored because the military said its contents were classified. Nevin also described a moment in the courtroom in January when a big red hockey light went off as he spoke. The not-so-subtle light is to be lit by the judge or the court's security officer - and only when classified information is disclosed. Journey: It's the first American war crimes trial since WWII and it will be held in over a year in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Every six weeks, 250 lawyers and other court personnel are flown to Cuba at a cost of $90,000 . Chief prosecutor Brigadier General Mark Martins insists the law is being followed and denies the assertion that a legal admission of guilt can't follow harsh coercion techniques like waterboarding after a certain amount of time has elapsed . But neither the judge nor the security officer turned the light on. And Mr Nevin claims he hadn’t disclosed anything classified. When the judge investigated, it was determined that the CIA had hit the light - and it isn’t the only time the agency had made its presence in the military proceeding. Attorney Cheryl Bormann, who represents Walid bin Attash, believes she once caught the CIA red handed. She said: ‘I'm meeting with my client in a room. And, up on the ceiling, like you would normally find in a jail with a client, there's a smoke detector. Silenced: Cheryl Bormann represents Walid bin Attash. She says she caught the CIA illegally monitoring her meetings with her client using a fake smoke detector, and that she's not legally allowed to even discuss whether he was waterboarded . Does he deserve it? David Nevin represents Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the admitted mastermind of 9/11. He says his client was waterboarded 183 times in a month but he's being censored from presenting it in his defense . Alerted: Nevin said this light in the Gitmo courtroom, designed to alert the court when someone has divulged classified info, mysteriously went off - and it turned out to the the CIA listening in . ‘And one day I'm sitting in there and my client stops one of the correctional guards and says, ""That's - what is that? You're listening, aren't you?"". The guard says, ""Of course we're not listening. That's a smoke detector”.’ She said she believed the guard but decided to investigate anyway, and got a big surprise when she Googled the smoke detector's manufacturer. She said: ‘It turns out that they only make listening devices that are intended to . look like smoke detectors and other surreptitious listening devices. We find this out while we're in Guantanamo.’ Mr Nevin . said the government refused to disclose why, how, or even if the CIA was . monitoring the 9/11 detainees, over 150 of whom had not been charged . with a crime in their 12 years at Guantanamo. Constitutional loophole? The defense complains that the constitution has been 'kicked down the road' in Guantanamo as over 150 detainees remain there, still without being charged, after 12 years . 'We've got to ensure that what we do in these cases is justice and can't be accused of being vengeance,' said Martins. 'And that's a great challenge.' Colonel Martins . said the proceedings were being handled in accordance with the law, and . said he didn’t know who, for instance, turned on the red light. As . for the years-long wait for trial, Mr Nevin said: ‘That's one of the reasons I have a . sense of urgency to try everybody that we can try.' While . Ms Bormann said she couldn't even discuss any classified torture her client . might or might not have undergone (or else face up to 30 years in prison), . Colonel Martins insisted the evidence he using was obtained from a so-called . ‘clean-team’ sent in after President Barack Obama banned advanced interrogation. Besides, he said: ‘Justice requires that you look deeper. ‘The . people do not forfeit their chance for accountability because someone . may have crossed a line or have coerced or subjected to harsh measures . somebody who is in custody.' He insisted the trial was being treated just like any other trial in the United States for a U.S. civilian citizen. He said: ‘The . accused is presumed innocent, the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a . reasonable doubt. We've got to ensure that what we do in . these cases is justice and can't be accused of being vengeance. And . that's a great challenge.’ The defense, including Navy Commander Walter Ruiz - the attorney for Mustafa al-Hawsawi - disagrees. He said: ‘Every . day we listen to the national anthem in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but yet the constitution has been kicked down the road and is . persona non grata in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.’","The defense says CIA monitoring, breaches of the constitution, and lack of transparency have made the trial a charade before it has even begun .

Residents of a quiet Mississippi town fear that a legendary creature called El Chupacabra has come to life to terrorize them just in time for Halloween. Jennifer Whitfield spotted the hairless beast near her yard in the suburban town of Picayune last week. Black, canine-like and lumbering, she said the unwanted visitor was like nothing she’d ever seen. ‘If a zombie had a dog,’ Whitefield said, ‘it would look like that.’ Scroll down for video... El Chupacabra? Some residents of a small Mississippi have been scared to even go outside after a creature resembling a legendary blood-sucking beast started showing up in their backyards . Uncanny: Like the beast of legend, the animal in Picayune, Mississippi is hairless, lumbering, and has an elongated snout . Whitfield spotted the creature with her 11-year-old son Justin, who was quick thinking enough to capture video of their frightening encounter, reports WLOX. The footage shows an animal not unlike a dog, but hairless and with a strange, elongated snout. It looks just like El Chupacabra, a creature originally of Puerto Rican legend whose notoriety has spread to the mainland U.S. along with alleged sightings of the livestock killing, blood sucking monster. Down the street from the Whitfields, the Denton family had seen it, too. 'If a zombie had a dog, it would look like that,' said resident Jennifer Whitfield, who caught the animal on video with her son Justin . Mangy? Mississippi wildlife authority David Burnette hasn't seen the creature but believes it's likely a coyote with a bad case of the mange . Opportunistic? Burnette says the animal is likely very ill and staying close to human habitats in order to have an easily obtainable source of food in the form of trash . Amanda Denton did the natural things and turned to Google for an answer. ‘I kept looking up “hairless coyote” and it kept saying “chupacabra,”’ Denton told WLOX. Thereafter, she stopped taking chances and made sure to avoid a potential encounter with El Chupacabra. ‘We've been running back and forth to our cars because we didn't want the chupacabra to get us,’ she said. Authorities were called, but at first their efforts were for naught. ‘I didn't know what it was, but then Animal Control couldn't find it, so maybe it was a chupacabra,’ said Denton’s husband Jonathan. LEGEND AND SIGHTINGS OF EL CHUPACABRA . The word comes from two Spanish words - 'chupar', to suck, and 'cabra', goat. The first reported sighting was In 1995, when eight sheep were found dead in Puerto Rico with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood. Thus, the legend of the livestock killing, vampire-like chupacabra was born. Since then, the legendary beast has been spotted across the Americas and even the world. A Mexican incident where 35 sheep were found mysteriously dead was blamed on El Chupacabra in 2012. Earlier this year, yet another Mississippi sighting came when a Leake County man actually shot and killed what he claimed was El Chupacabra. Even a Belarusian town had a Chupacabra sighting this past July . 'Goat sucker': The legend of El Chupacabra likely originates from a 1995 case in Puerto Rico where 8 sheep were found dead with puncture wounds. It has been described as hairless, or as having spines along its back, and as having blue or red eyes, among other attributes . SCIENCE ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN . Scientists often speculate that hairless creatures believed to be El Chupacabra are actually wildlife like coyotes, foxes, and stray dogs infested with parasites. Most commonly pointed to is the parasite Sarcoptes scabiei, which causes mange. Mange is a painful, potentially life threatening condition which can cause complete hair loss in mammals and can also cause their skin to shrivel, making for an even more ghoulish looking beast. In humans, Sarcoptes scabiei causes scabies and a consequent itchy, painful rash as the parasites burrow around, leaving their feces under the skin. Finally, the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks was called. Residents told Master Sergeant David Burnette what they saw and finally got a possible answer. ‘The way they described it to me,’ said Burnette, ‘it’s a coyote that’s really bad off with the mange.’ Burnette didn’t see the creature, but says it shouldn’t be an issue in the neighborhood so long as residents keep their distance. ‘It's probably sick, weak, and not able to hunt on its own, so it's going to the nearest food source it can find,’ he said. Common? The Picayune sighting was not the first, even inn Mississippi. A man in Leake County, Mississippi shot and killed this animal he insisted was El Chupacabra just last month . Pan-American: This alleged Chupacabra showed up in Kentucky in 2010 . That source happens to the trash left out by Picayune’s townspeople. The department advised residents ‘to let nature take its course.’ Similar alleged El Chupacabra spottings have been reported everywhere from nearby Leake County—where a man actually shot and killed the hairless beast he spotted—to Mexico and all the way in Belarus, where farmers killed what some say was a Chupacabra that was attacking local cows. In some instances, like in Leake County, a mange-infested animal was blamed. In Belarus, some say the creature was actually a fox poisoned by radiation. In any case, believers become more and more convinced they've seen the legendary El Chupacabra remain adamant that the beast is real and as sightings continue popping up in Central America, the U.S. and across the world.

Retail giant Amazon is to start offering Sunday delivery to all its customers after striking a deal with the US Postal Service (USPS). From November 17 shoppers in the New York and LA areas will be able to select Sunday as a delivery day at the checkout. While the offer will be free for Prime subscribers, regular customers will still have access to the service as long as they pay for business day delivery. Amazon will be offering Sunday delivery from November 17 in New York and LA areas but will be rolled out to other major cities including Dallas and New Orleans next year . Dave Clark, Amazon's vice president of worldwide operations and customer service, said: 'This is part of a continuing effort to make online shopping a normal, seven-day-a-week, any-time-you-want experience.' Amazon says it is planning to extend the year-round service next year to Dallas, New Orleans, Phoenix and other cities. The offer is thought to be the first of its kind in the US and  provides a lifeline for struggling USPS which lost $16billion last year according to Forbes, as the delivery of letters declined. By contrast the demand for package deliveries is 'increasing in double-digit percentages', according to a USPS spokeswoman. The deal is the first of its kind in the US and poses a challenge to other retailers like Google and EBay who are developing their own same-day service . USPS delivered around 3.5billion parcels last year, up from 3.3billion in 2011 and 3.1billion in 2010. Despite the extra demand the company says it will not be taking on any extra staff and will be using its flexible workforce, who have agreed to work the extra days. The one-of-a-kind offer will challenge other big-name retailers who have been beefing up their own delivery options. Wal-Mart is currently testing one-day delivery in northern Virginia, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Denver, and the San Fransisco and San Jose areas in California. EBay has recently aquired London start-up company Shtl, which offers same-day service to online customers, with some products arriving within minutes of an order being placed. Google is also trialling one-day delivery in the Bay area, while Sport Chalet started offering the same service in April. Amazon had previously offered a Sunday deliver service using its own employees, but it was extremely restricted and charged a premium rate.","LA and New York metropolitan areas will have service from November 17 .

Coachella Valley High School in California is being pressured to abandon their 'offensive and stereotypical' football mascot by an anti-discrimination group. The snarling, black-bearded mascot wearing a headscarf has been urging fans to root for the Southern Californian team, in the desert town just east of Palm Springs since the 1920s . But The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee recently sent a letter to officials at the Coachella Valley Unified School District asking them to get rid of the mascot - arguing that its 'large nose, heavy beard and Arab head covering' is offensive. An anti-discriminating group wants Coachella Valley High School to remove this snarling, black-bearded mascot . 'By allowing continued use of the term and imagery, you are commending and enforcing the negative stereotypes of an entire ethnic group, millions of whom are citizens of this nation,' Abed Ayoub, the group's director of legal and policy affairs, wrote in the letter. The request comes amid mounting pressure for the NFL's Washington Redskins to change its mascot because it's offensive to American Indians. The Arab mascot has been around since the 1920s and was chosen to recognize the area's reliance on date farming, traditionally a Middle Eastern crop. The nearby community of Mecca also pays homage to the Middle East. The mascot has evolved from a turban-wearing horseman carrying a lance to a standing figure with a scowl and a headscarf. The current mascot is based on an 'angry Arab' design from the 1950s, The Desert Sun reported. Coachella Valley High School's mascot, 'Arab', gives the thumbs during a game against Yucca Valley, in Thermal, California . Superintendent Darryl Adams said the topic will be discussed at a Nov. 21 school board meeting. He said he was taken aback by the 'Arab' name when he first was hired two years ago. 'Being an African-American from the Deep South, I'm sensitive to stereotyping,' Adams told the newspaper. 'But in this context, when this was created it was not meant in that way. It was totally an admiration of the connection with the Middle East.' Adams said the letter from the anti-discrimination group was the first time the school had been criticized for stereotyping in the past two years. Some school alumni have defended the mascot, saying it's a matter of pride. 'There was no intention to demean Arabs or be discriminatory in any way,' said David Hinkle, a 1961 graduate. 'I don't think it's right to decide now that you can't do that anymore. It is political correctness run amok, I would say.' Coachella Valley High School isn't the only institution using a controversial mascot - The Palm Springs High School mascot is the 'Indians' and Indio High features 'Rajah' - a turban-wearing Indian prince.","Mascot was chosen to recognize the area's reliance on date farming - traditionally a Middle Eastern crop .

One in four NHS hospital trusts is failing to offer safe, good-quality care to all its patients, a damning report has shown. Out of 161 trusts in England, 44 have now been labelled as ‘high risk’, with serious concerns raised about their performance. Shockingly, a number of the hospitals now marked out as risky were classified ‘safe’ as recently as earlier this year. Care: Labour said David Cameron should be 'ashamed' that' after three and a half years of the coalition one in four hospitals are at risk of poor performance. The Prime Minister is pictured visiting Salford Hospital, which is in the second highest band . Some of the hospitals have been . flagged up because of high death rates while others have been identified . because of frequent ‘never events’ – serious incidents that should . never occur in hospitals, such as amputating the wrong limb. Risk . factors that have also been taken into consideration include poor . safety measures, low staffing levels, lengthy waiting times, high levels . of superbugs or very low levels of patient satisfaction. Let down: Schoolgirl Amie Miller . Yesterday’s . report came after health watchdog the Care Quality Commission examined . 161 acute trusts across England against more than 150 indicators, giving . each one a risk score. The analysis will act as a screening tool to . identify which trusts need the most rapid inspections. This . new approach has shown that three times as many hospitals as previously . thought are actually failing, with 24 in the highest possible band of . risk and 44 trusts in the top two bands. One . of the failing hospitals was criticised earlier this year for not . carrying out simple tests on a schoolgirl who later died from a brain . condition. Amie Miller, 15, was taken to Basildon Hospital in November 2008 complaining of a headache. She . died three days later after a catalogue of errors at the risky . hospital. An inquest heard there were several missed opportunities to . save her life. Yesterday . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt welcomed the CQC’s tougher stance, but . insisted that the failings exposed by the review were the result of . ‘problems stretching back many years’. He . said: ‘Sadly, under the last government, a lack of transparency about . poor care meant problems went unchecked for too long, sometimes with . tragic consequences for patients. ‘The . CQC’s new tough and transparent approach to hospital standards is . exactly what our NHS needs. The information released today is not new in . many cases, several of these hospitals have had serious problems . stretching back for many years. Alert: University Hospital, Aintree in Liverpool is placed in Band 1, at high risk on whistleblowing alerts and mortality rates . Mothers: Northampton General Hospital, placed in Band 1, is at high risk on c-sections in maternity care, mortality data and whistleblowers . Inspector: Professor Mike Richards said the new bands would highlight where there is a risk that people might not be receiving' safe, effective, high quality care' ‘The . difference now is that this Government is being transparent with this . information and honest with the public about the quality of care at . their local hospitals, as well as taking tough action where standards . aren’t up to scratch.’ Peter . Walsh, chief executive of charity Action Against Medical Accidents, . said: ‘The results may be worrying, but we very much welcome the more . proactive approach by CQC which is more likely to identify dangerous . trusts. ‘What we most need now is action to put things right – before more patients are needlessly harmed.’ Katherine . Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said the report . was ‘hugely worrying’ but matched the complaints they had received which . suggested poor care was widespread in the NHS. However . Labour’s health spokesman Jamie Reed blamed the problems on a lack of . frontline cash, criticising the Government for spending money on . reorganisation. He said: . ‘Hospitals were left on a financial knife-edge and they are clearly . struggling to maintain standards of patient care after more than three . years of chaos. ‘Almost . 6,000 nursing jobs have been axed since the election and David Cameron . presided over the first summer A&E crisis in living memory.’ But . a Department of Health spokesman defended the new inspection regime, . saying: ‘Following the Francis Inquiry, the CQC has introduced radical . changes to hospital inspections. ‘A . new chief inspector, Sir Mike Richards, is leading significantly larger . inspection teams which are headed up by clinical and other experts. This next step will help to give the CQC a good picture of risk within . trusts.’ They added: . ‘Patient safety should be the first in everything the NHS does and we . expect the CQC to act where it finds failings of care.’ Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust is at high risk on whistleblowing, knee replacement and hernia surgery, A&E waiting times and poor patient experience . The Care Quality Commission has placed all 161 NHS trusts . in England in one of six ‘risk’ bands. 1 is the worst and 6 the best, based . on 150 indicators on the quality, safety and effectiveness of care.

The baby was delivered after Alexis Boyce, 23, was allegedly shot in the head by her husband and the child's father Michael Boyce on Thursday. Mrs Boyce was eight pregnant with twin boys. Doctors in Orlando, Florida, were only able to save one of the unborn babies. His grandfather revealed that the child's name is Jael Huntley, a name Mrs Boyce picked out before her death. Leon Huntley told WFTV that little Jael is in stable condition and it getting the best care available. 'We're still praying for the child to get stronger and stronger and we know it's in the hands of the Lord right now,' he said. 'They're doing all that they can do, as far as technology and medical science, that the child is getting the best care.' Mr Huntley said he has been overwhelmed by the support he has received from the community. Boyce has been charged with shooting his wife Alexis - a Master at Arms in the U.S. Navy after a fight in their Orlando home. Mr Huntley, who was in the next room, said he confronted Boyce when he still had the gun he had just used to killed his daughter in his hand. 'I had no fear. I demanded that he put the weapon down.

A woolly mammoth known as Yuka is to go on show to the public in Taipei, Taiwan from today. The three-metre long female mammoth died at the age of 10 and was discovered in Siberia in 2010. The prehistoric animal is thought to have lived 39,000 years ago, and her perfectly preserved body was discovered in the frozen ground by tusk-hunters, who handed it over to scientists. People in protective suits examine a frozen woolly mammoth named 'Yuka' during a media preview at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei . Measuring three-metre long the female mammoth was 10 when she died. Her frozen body was discovered in Siberia in 2010. She is thought to have roamed the frozen plains 39,000 years ago. Marks on her body including a long cut from her head to the centre of her back and an 'unusual patterned opening' on her right flank, suggest that cave men hunted the animals. The mammoth appears to have escaped another predator at an earlier stage as it had a broken leg and other injuries. Mammoths evolved from African elephants when the Ice Age set in. They were around twice the size of today's elephants and weighed up to eight tonnes. Their long tusks helped them fight predators and pick grass and shrubs out of the ice. Visitors to the exhibition, called THE FROZEN WOOLLY MAMMOTH, will be able to see Yuka's remarkable ginger coat up close. The woolly mammoth goes on show at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei today. While many bones have been found . before – so scientists have an idea of how the legendary creatures looked when . they roamed the icy plains –  Yuka is unique in being an almost complete carcass. A long straight cut stretches from the animal's head to the centre of its back and there is an 'unusual patterned . opening' on the right flank made of small serrations as if from a . primitive saw-like tool.

A long straight cut stretches from the animal's head to the centre of its back and there is an 'unusual patterned opening' on the right flank made of small serrations as if from a primitive saw-like tool . Yuka has been preserved in spectacularly good condition and is the first mammoth carcasss to be pulled from the ice with its ginger fur still attached . The discovery of Yuka has been described as being of 'huge significance' and could be the first direct evidence of early humans having attacked woolly mammoths. The prehistoric creature's carcass with its ginger fur (pictured right) is also the first of its kind ever found .

Lack of sleep could double the signs of skin ageing, including fine lines, claim researchers. A US study shows the skin of women who were poor sleepers showed accelerated signs of age and was slower to recover from damage such as sunburn. Women who slept badly were also more likely to rate themselves as unattractive. Side effects: Not getting enough restorative sleep can age skin and make it slow to repair . Dr Elma Baron, director of the Skin Study Center at University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, said: ‘Sleep-deprived women show signs of premature skin ageing and a decrease in their skin’s ability to recover after sun exposure.’ The study analysed 60 women aged 30 to 49, with half not getting enough sleep. Scientists used tests such as UV light exposure to check for moisture loss – a sign of poor skin quality. Those who had insufficient sleep showed increased signs of skin ageing, with an average score of 4.4 – double the 2.2 average for good sleepers. This means those who slept badly had more fine lines, uneven skin colour and slackening of skin. The differences were statistically significant, says the study, commissioned by Estee Lauder. Slow recovery: Skin damage can take longer to heal if women have not slept enough . The researchers found good sleepers repaired skin damage more quickly and they were  more likely to rate themselves  as attractive. Dr Baron said: ‘While chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to medical problems such as obesity, diabetes, cancer and immune deficiency, its effects on skin function have previously been unknown.’ Dr Daniel Yarosh, of Basic Science Research at Estee Lauder, said: ‘This research shows for the first time that poor sleep quality can accelerate signs of skin ageing and weaken the skin’s ability to repair itself at night.’",Research found good sleepers repaired skin damage more quickly .

A former New Labour health adviser will succeed the embattled head of the NHS Sir David Nicholson. Simon Stevens is to take on the task of overhauling the health service in England following recent scandals, while budgets remain tight. Sir David will stand down next April, after months of pressure over his role overseeing the scandal-hit Mid Staffordshire Trust where hundreds are feared to have died needlessly due to failings. Simon Stevens (left) will succeed the embattled heead of the NHS Sir David Nicholson (right) He was dubbed ‘The Man With No Shame’ after failing to take responsibility for the disaster, and was accused . of presiding over a system where doctors, nurses and managers were . afraid to speak out about poor care, and hundreds were handed gagging . orders. The job description for the role of NHS England’s chief executive – with a budget of nearly £100billion – said it was seeking ‘an inspirational and transformational leader’ to ‘deliver more and better quality with less’. Mr Stevens, 47, who was Tony Blair’s health adviser in Number 10, volunteered to take a 10 per cent pay cut on Sir David’s salary from £211,000 to £189,000. A Government source said he wanted to ‘show leadership in tough times’. It is understood he was David Cameron’s first choice for the role, and also the preferred candidate of Professor Sir Malcolm Grant, the chairman of the five-member board of NHS England who make the final choice, although the health secretary has the right of veto. Sir David Nicholson was dubbed The Man With No Shame after failing to take responsibility for the Mid Staffordshire Trust scandal . Well-regarded in the NHS, he has 25 years’ experience of healthcare management. He started out in hospital management before being appointed as a policy adviser to Alan Milburn while he was health secretary in 1997-2001 and then as health policy adviser to Blair in Number Ten from 2001-2004, but he is seen as non-ideological. During his time as a New Labour adviser he helped develop their key policies to slash waiting times, expand the number of frontline staff and allow hospitals to become self-governing trusts. For the past nine years he has worked in senior roles for UnitedHealth, a not-for-profit healthcare provider in the US. He is currently president of their Global Health division which develops private healthcare systems in other countries. Mr Stevens said: ‘The next five years are going to be extremely challenging for the NHS, but compassionate high quality care for all is as vital as ever. Professor Sir Malcolm Grant, chair of the NHS England board, said he is 'delighted' at Mr Steven's appointment . ‘It will be a privilege to lead NHS England - at a time when the stakes have never been higher - because I believe in the NHS, and because I believe that a broad new partnership of patients, carers, staff and the public can together chart a successful future for our Health Service.’ He starts at a time of pressures on NHS budgets from an ageing population and the rising cost of managing chronic conditions. Sir Malcolm said: ‘I am delighted that Simon will be taking on this exceptionally challenging leadership role for the NHS. He has huge experience, both national and global, and across all sectors, and is admired by healthcare professionals across the world for his commitment to the values of the NHS and to the provision of quality healthcare for all. ‘We have been through a rigorous global search, and engaged with a range of excellent candidates. I am confident that Simon Stevens is the right person to lead NHS England through the coming years, bringing new ideas and fresh energy.’","Simon Stevens will succeed NHS head Sir David Nicolson in April .

Plea: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson asked the industry to try to reduce costs . Water companies have been urged by ministers to scrap planned hikes in bills to ease the pressure on family finances. The government has ordered the water regulator to ‘get under the skin’ of suppliers to ensure bills are not increased simply to maximise profits. Ministers have been under fire for their failure to prevent major rises in gas and electricity bills this winter by the Big Six firms who hiked prices by an average of 9.1 per cent. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson today asked the industry to try to reduce costs – and will promise bill payers a ‘fair deal’ by writing to the companies to stress ‘the tough times that households are facing and the crucial role that the industry can play to bring costs down’. Household water bills are set by regulator Ofwat, and increased by 3.5 per cent for this year – or £13 – to an average of £388 beginning in April. Water firms are more heavily regulated than the energy industry, but Ofwat also believes costs could be reduced over the next five years to reflect efficiency savings and the low cost of borrowing. Mr Paterson said: ‘We know that household budgets are under pressure, and keeping water bills affordable is a crucial way we can help hardworking people. That is why we are pressing hard to make sure customers get a fair deal.’ Firms will be ‘encouraged’ to review planned price increases, and introduce more discounts for vulnerable customers known as ‘social tariffs’ – although this will remain voluntary. This and other measures are expected to help cut the soaring burden of bad debt - when people cannot pay their bills and they are saddled onto other customers to the tune of £15-£20 per household. Ofwat set guidelines for prices five years in advance and then tweaks them when inflation figures are published in November. They believe the next price review for 2015 to 2020 which is published next year could reduce bills by up to £750 million a year - or around £30 per household. Water minister Dan Rogerson said Ofwat is the ‘key player’ in driving down water bills. He said that as long as investment was not jeopardised ‘we don't want to see bills going up unnecessarily’. ‘That is now a matter for Ofwat to get under the skin of all the companies,’ he told the Western Morning News. Sonia Brown, chief regulation officer at Ofwat said last week that there are ‘real opportunities’ for companies to reduce bills partly due to low interest rates. She said any company that will not be reducing them should provide ‘clear evidence that this is backed by its customers’. Costs: The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is to rush out action to limit water bill rises in an attempt to take back control of political debate over the cost of living . It refused an application from Thames Water which supplies 8million customers in London, to increase bills by 8 per cent this year. In September, George Osborne water bills were on the cards to reduce the ‘burden on families’ as well as energy bills, the cost of housing, transport and fees for financial services. But Labour’s environment spokeswoman Maria Eagle said British households face some of the highest water bills in Europe - and two million now spend more than 5pc of their income on water. Water UK, representing the suppliers, said they were already working on social tariffs and tackling bad debt, while efficiency savings have saved customers around £120.","Owen Paterson writes to water firms to ask them to reduce costs .

George Osbourne is planning to cut £75 of green taxes from household energy bills next month, according to industry sources . George Osbourne is planning to cut £75 of green taxes from household energy bills next month, industry sources claim. Levies which go towards low-carbon energy and insulating draughty homes will be taken off electricity and gas bills and put into general taxation, they said. Since David Cameron announced his intention to 'roll back' the green levies on households bills last month, this is the first time a concrete figure has been put forward. The power industry are braced for an announcement by the chancellor in the Autumn Statement, his mini-budget on December 4, to try and contain the growing row about rising energy bills. An average household's dual fuel bill has reached £1,400 after four of the Big Six energy firms, which cover 98pc of customers, hiked prices by an average of 9.1 per cent this winter. Green levies add £112 to annual bills, but are set to reach £286 by 2020 according to forecasts from the Department for Energy and Climate Change, who claim in the long run they will reduce bills. Attempts to cut down the burden have focused on the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) which is supposed to insulate the homes of people in fuel poverty but much of it is used for large, draughty homes. It accounts for £47 of green levies - although energy companies claim it can be far higher, npower claiming it adds £69 to the average bill. The Warm Homes Discount, costing £11 per household, which does help those struggling with their bills, could also be moved to general taxation. But the £30 which goes in direct subsidies to wind farms and nuclear power stations is likely to stay on bills. Ministers are thrashing out a substantial offer to reduce green levies on bills, while meeting commitments Britain has legally committed to regarding cutting carbon emissions, and overcoming the opposition of the environmentally-minded Liberal Democrats. Energy secretary Ed Davey, a Lib Dem, . announced last week there would be annual 'competition test' for the Big . Six to ensure their measures of rising wholesale prices are justified, . with criminal sanctions for bosses judged to have fixed prices to . rip-off customers. Energy secretary Ed Davey, a Lib Dem, announced last week there would be annual 'competition test' for the Big Six . Rising bills have dominated the agenda since Labour leader Ed Miliband announced he would freeze energy bills for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But while moving bills to general taxation would reduce the burden on the poorest, it would mean the government will have to find potentially more than £1billion of savings in other areas. Six bosses at the Government’s Green Investment Bank receive higher salaries than the Prime Minister. The Cabinet Office’s list of high-earning public officials and civil servants shows five of the seven highest paid are employed by the Bank, each earning between £275,000 and £335,000.

Tory MPs staged a revolt yesterday against plans to build thousands  of homes on the Green Belt, saying  it would lead to ‘planning anarchy’ and lose them votes at the next election. Angry backbenchers criticised Planning Minister Nick Boles for forcing a major building programme on councils to meet a chronic housing shortage. But he said they had to respond to a housing crisis caused by an ageing population and uncontrolled immigration under the last Labour government. Backbenchers said ministers had promised that they could decide where to build homes and draw up local plans. But they claimed developers were . being allowed to ride roughshod over the wishes of local planners and . foist housing developments on unsuitable areas. Former planning minister Sir Tony . Baldry said four developments proposed in his Banbury constituency were . refused by the council, only to be given the green light by Local . Government Secretary Eric Pickles. Sir Tony said the decisions ‘rode a . coach and horses though protection for the Green Belt’, adding: ‘This is . not a sensible planning policy, this is planning anarchy.’ Under threat: Mr Boles has claimed an area of greenfield land the size of London must be built on to solve the crisis . Laurence Robertson, MP for . Tewkesbury, said there was no shortage of homes in his constituency, but . developers planned to build 50 per cent more within 20 years. He added: ‘I question the .

Last year, Mr Boles told councils to find the land to build 270,000 homes by 2018. He has claimed an area of greenfield land the size of London must be built on to solve the crisis. Yesterday he told MPs it was better to  build on former industrial land, but this could only be used for 70 per cent of the homes needed, adding: ‘Our population has grown, and we have not built enough houses to keep pace. ‘That growth has two main sources. One is immigration, but the majority – about two thirds – is a result of ageing. 'It used to be rare that there was a great grandparent in the family, now it is common.

His school principal, Christine Malandro, spoke highly of the student and said of his progress: 'He's doing really well. 'He's very bright. He's a very resilient child. He just really wants to get back to school right away. That's his goal.' Eden's father, Luis Miranda Ochoa, 32, mother Viviana Rodriguez Saldado, 31, who was seven months pregnant, and his three siblings, Irvin, 12, Jose, six and Stephanie, five, were all killed. The drunk driver was ex-con Ryan Christopher Morales, 28, who was allegedly drinking vodka on the afternoon of October 22 before speeding in his SUV. Morales was also injured in the accident but was arrested on Friday after being released from Lodi hospital. He faces six counts of second degree murder and six counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated. He is currently in San Joaquin County Jail. Eden Miranda was listed in critical condition at University of California Davis Medical Center just three weeks ago in the aftermath of the deadly six-car collision in Lodi.

Eyewitness Erin Andrews told the Sacramento Bee that the brown SUV appeared to be doing about 100mph when it blew through a busy intersection, with the driver clutching a cell phone to his ear. ‘He looked angry, like he was on a mission,’ Andrews said. The carnage that decimated the Miranda family left the local community reeling. About 250 people gathered at the debris-strewn site of the crash for an emotional vigil to remember the young victims and their parents after the incident. Sabien Tafoya, 13, lit a candle for his friend Irving Miranda, describing him as a smart and funny boy who enjoyed making his friends laugh. Lodi Middle School also held a moment of silence for the 11-year-old and his two younger siblings. ‘We’re trying not to forget a loving friend,’ 12-year-old Jason Ordinola, who was on the soccer team with Irving, told Lodi News. Horrific aftermath: Police and fire officials work at the scene of the multicar crash in Lodi that killed six and injured 12 .

A television wildlife expert who appeared on Alan Titchmarsh’s chat show has walked free from court despite being convicted of keeping more than 70 exotic animals in 'unspeakable' conditions. Stephen Rowlands, 32, made regular television appearances and taught schoolchildren across the UK about the rare creatures with his company Tropical Inc. The company, which teaches school children about tropical animals, states on its website that its staff can educate people about how to care for exotic pets. When police raided the company’s headquarters in Dunhampton, Worcester, on January 3 they found 74 tropical creatures starved and crammed in four squalid holding pens. Scroll down for video . Convicted: Wildlife expert Stephen Rowlands, shown here on The Alan Titchmarsh Show on February 16, 2012, was found guilty of 34 counts of animal cruelty . Squalid: Animals such as racoons and porcupines were kept in cages piled on top of each other in a small room . Unspeakable: The animals lived without electricity, light and food at Tropical Inc in Dunhampton, Worcester . A court heard investigators found . meerkats, parrots, monkeys, turtles, owls, snakes and an armadillo kept . without electricity, light and food. The creatures were confiscated by RSPCA officers under the Animal Welfare Act after they were found covered in faeces. It has since cost the charity more than £100,000 to care for the range of bizarre breeds - which also included coatis (Brazilian aardvarks), genets (African mongooses), snapping turtles, tortoises, snakes, a porcupine, Harris hawks, and cotton-top tamarin monkeys. Rowlands was convicted of animal cruelty at Worcester Magistrates Court on Thursday after pleading guilty to 34 counts of not providing a suitable habitat. But a judge refused to jail Rowlands - who still teaches and presents on Tropical Inc shows - or ban him from working with, or keeping, animals. 'Unspeakable': Police found monkeys, an armadillo, hawks and other creatures cramped into four pens . Teacher: Rowlands, 32, teaches schoolchildren across the UK about the wild animals he keeps at the HQ . Not able to care for them: The judge ordered Rowlands to forfeit seven animals as he cannot care for them . Neglected: This armadillo is curled up in a sty filled with debris such as food packets in the company's HQ . Instead the TV personality was handed a 12-week jail term - suspended for two years - and £100,000 legal costs. Deputy district judge Nalla Lawrence said conditions at Tropical Inc had been 'unspeakable' and admitted the animals had 'suffered a great deal'. However, he ruled a ban would be 'going too far' because Rowlands had made 'tremendous progress' in refurbishing the facilities. The judge ordered Rowlands to forfeit seven animals and imposed a deprivation order which will see a further 36 removed from his possession. Passing sentence he said: 'He has learnt his lesson. 'This prosecution has prompted him to wake up. Adjustments: Tropical Inc has said they will work with the RSPCA to ensure their enclosures are safe . Keeping animals: The judge did not ban Rowlands from keeping animals or working with them in the future . 'I find if I return these animals to him he may not be able to care for them to the standard that he would want to, so I am not going to return them.” Rowlands was ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work as well as paying legal costs of £6,100, further costs of £100 and an £80 victim surcharge. Prosecutor Nick Sutton - on behalf of the RSPCA - told the court Tropical Inc’s website offers parties and educational talks on exotic animals. Mr Sutton said: 'The society’s view is this is a commercial business. 'The animals are the stock and trade of this business - it’s open to be seen.' Alan Titchmarsh interviewed Rowlands about the care of tropical animals such as turtles on his show last year . Dominic Benthall, defending, said Rowlands had taken steps since the raid to improve the animals’ accommodation. Mr Benthall said the company now employed a veterinary nurse, part-time carer and cleaner and students to help care for the animals. He also denied Rowlands, from Oldbury, West Midlands, ran the business purely for financial gain. He said: 'If it was just a business he would have fewer animals.' Rowlands, who has made regular appearances on ITV1’s Alan Titchmarsh Show can still be seen on Tropical Inc’s Facebook page appearing at company events. One picture, uploaded the same day as the court hearing, shows a young girl holding a parrot in front of Rowlands wearing a t-shirt with the company logo. In a statement posted two days after the dawn raid, the company said it was working to improve conditions in its holding pens. They said: 'As some of you may already be aware, the RSPCA visited our developing site on 3rd January 2013 at 6.30am, which unfortunately resulted in some of our rescued animals being removed from the site. 'As we had recently received planning permission to build our new education centre, some of the existing buildings had to be demolished in the process of constructing the new premises. Some of our animals had been moved from their enclosures to temporary indoor enclosures and the RSPCA have deemed some of these temporary enclosures to be unfit. Sentence: Rowlands, from the West Midlands, was handed a 12-month jail term suspended for two years . 'We would like to make everyone aware that these enclosures were temporary and it was never our intention to keep animals in them for any prolonged amount of time. 'However due to the extreme wet weather we have been experiencing which has caused significant problems for us and some animals had been in these enclosures for longer than we had anticipated. 'We wholeheartedly agree that animal welfare is a priority and will be working with the RSPCA to make sure our temporary enclosures are more suitable for our animals and will keep you all updated when we can. 'We would like to thank everyone for their support.'","Stephen Rowlands, 32, had meerkats, snakes, a porcupine, monkeys, and an armadillo in 4 pens at the headquarters for wildlife company Tropical Inc .

A boy had half of his skull removed because of a simple sinus infection but didn't let it get in the way of his schoolwork. Despite undergoing extreme surgery to halt the spread of the infection, Oliver Kirk, nine, from Abingdon in Oxfordshire, still attended school and protected his vulnerable brain by wearing a bicycle helmet. The operation left half his brain covered only by a thin layer of skin and, as a result, he had to wear the helmet for five months. However, two weeks ago he had surgery to place a ceramic skull replacement over the gap. He is now free of the helmet and looking forward to playing sport again. Oliver's initial infection was common - sinusitis causes the chambers above the nose to swell and become painful. It typically causes a high temperature, pain and tenderness in the face, and a blocked or runny nose. The majority of people take over-the-counter medications and the infection clears up on its own. When the condition is severe, antibiotics are often able to control the spread of infection to the nearby bone. However, . in very rare cases  - about one in 10,000 - infection can spread to the . area surrounding the eye, the bones, the blood or the brain. His mother, Liz, and father, David, first noticed something was wrong in February when Oliver's eyes began to droop and he suffered headaches. This was because his brain was beginning to swell and push against his eyes. His condition rapidly deteriorated and surgeons were forced to painstakingly cut away the entire left side of his skull. Doctors 'cleaned' his brain of infection but were concerned that potentially . fatal bacteria had spread into his skull bone, so decided not to replace . it after surgery. Oliver underwent surgery to remove half his skull because a usually harmless sinus infection spread to the bone in his skull, and to his brain . Oliver was back on his . feet within weeks, but with only his skin covering his brain he had to . wear a helmet to protect his 'squidgy' head. Two weeks ago he went under the knife again to allow doctors to fit a new custom-made ceramic skull implant. Oliver said: 'An infection went . up my nose and under my skull so they had to take the skull out, and . they then stitched the skin back over so you couldn't see the inside. Surprisingly Oliver was back on his feet within weeks, but with only his skin covering his brain he had to wear a helmet to protect his 'squidgy' head. Two weeks ago he went under the knife again when doctors fitted a new custom-made ceramic skull implant . 'At first I thought ""Where has it gone?"" and then my mum told me and I was really shocked. It felt really weird. It was really squidgy and jelly.' Sinusitis is inflammation of the lining of the sinuses, caused by a viral or bacterial infection. The sinuses are small, air-filled cavities behind the cheekbones and forehead. Sinusitis typically causes a high temperature, pain and tenderness in the face, and a blocked or runny nose. It is a common, usually harmless, condition and can affect people of any age . Complications of sinusitis are more common in children than in adults. If a child has sinusitis and swelling around the cheekbone or eyelid, it may be a bacterial infection of the skin and soft tissue or an infection of the tissue surrounding the eye. When the condition is severe, antibiotics are often able to control the spread of infection to the nearby bone. However, in very rare cases - about one in 10,000 - infection can spread to the area surrounding the eye, the bones, the blood or the brain. This can be fatal unless treated quickly. He added: 'When the skull wasn't there it was like a blancmange, because it was all squidgy, and there was only fluid there, and it wasn't symmetrical like heads sould be.' Oliver was on holiday with his parents, and brother Christian, 14, in February, when he developed a temperature. Surgeons at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford discovered an infection had moved from his sinuses to his brain and was putting pressure on his skull. He was rushed into surgery and doctors worked against the clock to catch the infection before it permanently damaged his brain. He was in an induced coma for three days, but after a few weeks in bed he was back on his feet. His mother said: 'He went back to school and he could do anything apart from sport. 'He had to wear his protective helmet right up until two weeks ago. 'He then underwent surgery to have a ""ceramic"" skull replacement fitted. The material, which is similar in tecture to coral, is porous. 'This means that as Ollie’s skull grows it will fuse with the synthetic bone, healing over the hole. 'Because the skull implant will be able to grow with Ollie, it will not restrict the growth of his brain and affect his development. 'He was really good about it and got . used to it. His attitude and his positive approach over the last few . months has been a lesson to us all really.' Oliver underwent surgery to have a 'ceramic' skull replacement fitted (mock up of how much was removed). The material, which is similar in texture to coral, is porous. This means that as Oliver skull grows it will fuse with the synthetic bone, healing over the hole . Surgeons believe it is the first time the operation has been carried out in the UK in response to an infection, instead of trauma. They hope it will eventually fuse with his remaining bits of skull. Neurosurgeon Dr Shailendra Magdum said: 'Ollie's case is, I think, the first case in this country to use this material.'","Oliver Kirk, from Oxfordshire, developed sinusitis that spread to his brain .

Miss Teen USA California Cassidy Wolf arrives to the Premiere of ""Wiener Dog Nationals"" at Pacific Theatre at The Grove on June 18, 2013 in Los Angeles, California . A 19-year-old Southern California computer science student pleaded guilty Tuesday to hacking the computers of Miss Teen USA and other women and secretly photographing them with their own webcams. Jared James Abrahams, of Temecula, answered a series of questions from U.S. District Judge James Selna in an Orange County courtroom, including an explanation of the crimes that were committed. 'I hacked several girls' computers and, using their webcams, took photos of them when they weren't aware,' Abrahams said meekly. Abrahams pleaded guilty to three counts of extortion and one count of unauthorized access of a computer. He faces up to 11 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million when he's sentenced in March. Over the past two years, Abrahams hacked into the computers of at least a dozen women in their late teens or early 20s from various states and countries, including Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf. The pair attended Great Oaks High School together for four years, . graduating in 2012. Scroll Down for Video . Guilty: Jared James Abrahams appears outside the Santa Ana, CA., court in September after posting $50,000 bail for his release . Court records say he also sent the women anonymous emails telling them he had downloaded nude photos of them. He told them he would publish the images on social media sites if they didn't send him additional pictures or undress for him. If the women complied, Abrahams promised to destroy the images. At least two of his victims gave in to his demands, authorities said. 'Did you know you were extorting them when you made these demands?' Selna asked. 'Yes,' Abrahams responded. Dressed in matching gray pants and shirt with a black jacket, Abrahams told the judge he has autism and has been under treatment for the past 10 years. He said he was on three medications Tuesday, but he said they wouldn't affect his ability to enter a guilty plea. Outside court, his attorney Alan Eisner said Abrahams apologizes for his actions. He said the autism played a contributing role in the scheme. 'The social disorder had, certainly, a part in it,' Eisner said. 'Again, I say that not to blame the conduct on anything, not to make an excuse for the conduct, but that's part of the full picture.' In Wolf's case, Abrahams was able to take nude photos of her without her knowledge, authorities said. He posted a naked photo of Wolf online after she didn't respond to him. Watch Video Here: . [captio . According to an FBI affidavit, Abrahams told Wolf: 'Your dream of being a model will be transformed into a pornstar.' Wolf, also 19 and a graduate of Great Oak High School in Temecula, won the Miss Teen USA crown in August. She has spoken publicly about the incident, saying she would use her fame to highlight cybercrime. Abrahams is accused of employing similar hacking tactics used by a Florida man who was sentenced to 10 years in prison last year after he broke into the personal online accounts of Scarlett Johansson, Christina Aguilera and other women and posted revealing photos and other material online. In September, Wolf told the website of NBC's ""Today"" show that earlier this year she received an anonymous email in which the sender claimed to have stolen images from the camera on her home computer. The sender of the email threatened to go public with images captured from Wolf's webcam unless she would provide nude pictures of herself, Eimiller said - a crime commonly known as 'sextortion.' Instead, Wolf went to authorities, and an investigation was launched in March. Shock: Cassidy Wolf, from California, was crowned as Miss Teen USA 2013 in the Bahamas . A federal complaint filed on Sept. 17 and unsealed Thursday charges Jared James Abrahams with extortion but Eimiller said other charges are possible. An FBI agent's affidavit, included in the complaint, contends that Abrahams used malicious software to remotely operate webcams to capture nude photos and videos of at least seven women as they changed clothes - some of whom he knew personally and others he found by hacking Facebook pages. The agent alleged that Abrahams, when interviewed, acknowledged controlling 30 to 40 hacked computers and extorting some women. Abrahams, a college freshman majoring in computer science, allegedly would use the women's webcams to capture nude images, then send emails threatening to post them on their hacked social media accounts unless they either sent him nude photos, a nude video, or logged onto the Skype video chat service and follow his orders for five minutes. Beauty queen: Months ahead of the pageant, 19-year-old Wolf (left) was the victim of the cyber-crime . Warning: She now visits local schools to warn others of her story and to give tips in online safety . He allegedly threatened Wolf that unless she heeded his demands, he would release her nude photos 'all over the Internet' and 'your dream of being a model will be transformed into a pornstar.' According to the affidavit, the victims included several women from other countries. One teenager in Ireland responded to the demands by writing: 'Please remember I'm 17. Have a heart,' according to the court record. Abrahams allegedly responded: 'I'll tell you this right now! I do NOT have a heart. However, I do stick to my deals. Also age doesn't mean a thing to me!!!' The girl then allegedly stripped during a Skype session, according to the FBI affidavit. A woman in Canada also stripped, according to the document.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:38 EST, 9 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:38 EST, 9 November 2013 . France raised questions Saturday about whether a proposed deal to temporarily curb Iran's nuclear program went far enough, complicating negotiations with the Iranians and casting doubt on whether an agreement could be reached during the current round of negotiations. Chances of that appeared to diminish as the day went on. A Western diplomat in Geneva for the talks told The Associated Press said it appeared that a new round of talks would be needed to agree on all points of a start-up deal meant to lead to a comprehensive agreement to ensure that Tehran's nuclear work remains peaceful. In talks: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry seen outside Intercontinental Hotel where talks about Iran's nuclear program are ongoing . Same side: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (left) meets with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during the Iran nuclear talks in Geneva, on November 9 . He said preparations were being made by both sides for an announcement later in the day of a new meeting within a few weeks. He said earlier that the French were holding out for conditions on the Iranians tougher than those agreed to by the U.S. and France's other negotiating partners, diminishing hopes of a done deal Saturday. But the talks in Geneva were still underway, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, and foreign ministers from Britain, France, Germany and Russia holding meetings with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius spoke of 'several points that... we're not satisfied with compared to the initial text,' telling France-Inter Radio his country did not want to be part of a 'con game.' He did not specify, but his comments suggested France thought a final draft of any first-step deal was too favorable to Iran. Concerns also were raised by Israel and a number of prominent figures in the U.S. Congress. The French position was confirmed by another Western diplomat. Niether gave specifics and demanded anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on the diplomatic maneuvering. Fabius' remarks were the first to provide some specifics on the obstacles at the Geneva talks, now in their third day. He spoke by telephone from Geneva. Negotiations: Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif (left) and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Catherine Ashton (right) speak together during the third day of closed-door nuclear talks in Geneva on Saturday . Fabius mentioned differences over Iran's Arak reactor southeast of Tehran, which could produce enough plutonium for several nuclear weapons a year once it goes online. He also said there was disagreement over efforts to limit Iran's uranium enrichment to levels that would require substantial further enriching before they could be used as the fissile core of a nuclear weapon. French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal pointed to 'rather large cohesion' among the negotiators and said France wanted 'the international community to see a serious change in the climate' of talks with Iran. 'There have been years of talks that have led to nothing,' Nadal said, alluding to the need for tough terms on Iran. Iran, which denies any interest in nuclear weapons, currently runs more than 10,000 centrifuges that have created tons of fuel-grade material that can be further enriched to arm nuclear warheads. It also has nearly 440 pounds (200 kilograms) of higher-enriched uranium in a form that can be turned into weapons much more quickly. Experts say 550 pounds (250 kilograms) of that 20 per cent-enriched uranium are needed to produce a single warhead. Iran says it expects Arak, the plutonium producing reactor, to be completed and go online sometime next year. It would need additional facilities to reprocess the plutonium into weapons-grade material and the U.N's nuclear agency monitoring Iran's atomic activities says it has seen no evidence of such a project. Roundtable: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry with diplomats from China, England, Germany, France and and Russia during the third day of closed-door nuclear talks in Geneva on November 9, 2013 . Fabius said Iran is opposed to suspending work on Arak while nuclear negotiations go on in attempt to reach a first-stage agreement and then a comprehensive final deal limiting Tehran's atomic work. He said that 'for us' suspension was absolutely necessary, but it was unclear if that meant France was alone in seeing the issue as non-negotiable or whether he was speaking for the rest of the negotiating group.Iran is also being asked to blend down 'a great part of this stock at 20 per cent, to five per cent,' Fabius said. Uranium enriched to five per cent is considered reactor fuel grade and upgrading it to weapons-level takes much longer than for 20 per cent enriched uranium. He also suggested that the six powers were looking for an Iranian commitment to cap future enrichment at five percent. 'We are hoping for a deal, but for the moment there are still issues that have not been resolved,' Fabius said. Debate: (left to right) British Foreign Secretary William Hague, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, Germany's Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton attend talks at the Intercontinental Hotel in Geneva . Signaling that the talks could end without agreement, British Foreign Secretary William Hague spoke of unresolved issues and told reporters 'there is no fixed time for us to reach a conclusion.' Any agreement would be a breakthrough after nearly a decade of mostly inconclusive talks, but would only be the start of a long process to reduce Iran's potential ability to produce nuclear arms, with no guarantee of ultimate success. Kerry and his European counterparts arrived in Geneva on Friday with the talks at a critical stage following a full day of negotiations Thursday and said some obstacles remained in the way of any agreement offering sanctions reductions for nuclear concessions. The presence of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and word that Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Baodong Li also was headed to the talks provided fresh hope for at least an interim deal. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted Friday any agreement in the making was a 'bad deal' that gave Iran a pass by offering to lift sanctions for cosmetic concessions that he said left intact Tehran's nuclear weapons-making ability. Critical: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on November 8 that Israel will not be bound to any agreements reached between Iran and the six world powers . Israel is strongly critical of any deal that even slightly lifts sanctions unless Iran is totally stripped of technology that can make nuclear arms.Asked about Netanyahu's criticism, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said 'any critique of the deal is premature' because an agreement has not been reached. The White House later said President Barack Obama called Netanyahu to update him on the ongoing talks and said Obama affirmed he's still committed to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The White House said Obama and Netanyahu will stay in close contact. Kerry tempered reports of progress, warning of 'important gaps' that must be overcome. But Lavrov's deputy, Sergei Ryabov, was quoted as saying that Moscow expects them to produce a 'lasting result expected by the international community.'The talks primarily focus on the size and output of Iran's enrichment program, which can create both reactor fuel and weapons-grade material suitable for a nuclear bomb. Iran insists it is pursuing only nuclear energy, medical treatments and research, but the U.S. and its allies fear that Iran could turn this material into the fissile core of nuclear warheads.","John Kerry has participated in the third day of talks over Iran's nuclear program .

Commuters on the London Underground have been urged to walk instead of taking the train in the latest bid to cut congestion during the rush hour. Passengers frequently complain that rush hour services on some lines are so packed that it can be hard to find a place to stand comfortably, let alone get a seat. But instead of compensating commuters for the poor conditions or increasing the frequency of trains, Transport for London bosses have launched a new campaign to persuade passengers to avoid the Tube altogether. Crush: Tube passengers have been urged to avoid public transport during peak rush hour times . Londoners arriving at Northern Line stations in Clapham, Balham and Tooting this morning were handed leaflets advising them to consider walking to their destination, according to the Evening Standard. The pamphlets, as well as information boards at the stations, warned commuters to avoid travelling altogether between 8am and 8.45 as part of a pilot scheme to reduce congestion. In addition, it was suggested that passengers should walk or cycle between the busiest stations. The journey between Tooting Bec and Clapham North, the stations at either end of the area targeted today, takes seven minutes by train, but by foot would be around 50 minutes. Moreover, thousands of people commute from South London into the City or the West End, which would take hours to walk to. Busy: Transport for London is hoping to reduce the density of passengers at peak times . Some passengers expressed outraged that they were being told not to take the Tube even though many have bought travelcards which cost at least £1,000 a year. Others pointed out that - like this morning, when it was raining at the stations involved in the scheme - the weather is often too bad to walk. Advertising worker Laura Belcher, 26, told the Standard: 'I can't see why TfL can't put on more trains. It's terrible.' Caroline Pidgeon, the Liberal Democrats' London transport spokesman, added: 'If TfL want more people to walk they need to provide an incentive for people to do so, such as travelcard discounts.' Stuart Reid, programme director of TfL, insisted that the organisation is not trying to force its customers off trains. 'We are certainly not calling for everyone to walk,' he said. 'We are providing information to customers on when the busiest times are at their stations so that they can make an informed choice on whether to make a small change to their journey, if they are able to. 'We appreciate that not everyone can change their travel time, but for those who may be able to by making a small change to the time they travel could make their journeys more comfortable.' The scheme is based on last year's Olympics, when bosses managed to ease congestion on the Tube by persuading them to avoid rush hour travel.","Leaflets handed out to passengers at South London Tube stations .

Brutal: Magomed Abdusalamov (right) lost a bloody bout with Mike Perez Saturday night in which he broke both his hand and his nose . After the fight, Abdusalamov complained of a headache. A scan revealed he was suffering from a blood clot in his brain . He was rushed to surgery to remove the clot and stem the bleeding. Doctors put him in a medically-induced coma. He is currently unconscious in critical condition, according to doctors at Roosevelt Hospital. The New York Daily News reports that Abdusalamov, 32, walked out of the ring Saturday night after losing to Cuban-born Perez by a unanimous decision of the judges. He could be seen shaking his head in disappointment. Abdusalamov was 18-0 with 18 knockouts before Saturday night's fight, which was broadcast on HBO Sports. The match was the talk of Twitter for its brutality and Abdusalamov's reputation as the 'Russian Tyson.' Perez beat the 'Russian Tyson' after 10 rounds in the ring on Saturday night. It was his first loss. Previously he had scored 18 knockouts in 18 bouts . Both men took a beating during the brawl, though it appears Abdusalamov took the brunt of the damage, as evidenced by his swollen face . Abdusalamov is married with two young daughters. His promoter says he's in the process of becoming an American citizen . His promoter Nathan Lewkowicz, says despite the doctors' assessments, the boxer is actually in 'stable' condition and his reflexes appear to be returning. Lewkowicz said the Abdusalamov's doctors hope he will be able to make a full recovery because of his age and his conditioning. Perez, who is now 20-0 with 12 knockouts, issued a statement Monday expressing concern for his opponent. 'Mago is in my thoughts and prayers and I hope he recovers quickly,' he said. 'He fought like a true warrior. I'm happy to be victorious but my main concern is for his health.'

Paul McCartney has asked Vladimir Putin to release 28 Greenpeace activists arrested for scaling an oil rig. The former Beatle reminded the Russian president that his 1968 single Back in the USSR was positive about the Soviet Union – and he wanted the favour returned. In a letter, he said the White Album song also had a line about how good it was to come home and the protesters deserved the same thing. Sir Paul McCartney has written a personal letter to the Russian president calling for the release of Greenpeace activists . Sir Paul, 71, said the activists, who . include eight Britons, were not anti-Russian or violent. ‘It would be . great if this misunderstanding could be resolved and the protesters can . be home with their families in time for Christmas,’ he wrote. ‘Vladimir, . millions of people in dozens of countries would be hugely grateful if . you were to intervene to bring about an end to this affair.’ The protesters, who  were arrested in the Arctic Sea on September 18, are being held in St Petersburg. The Russian ambassador to London claims their plight has not been properly represented by the media. Sir Paul, who has met Mr Putin in the Kremlin, wrote: 'Forty-five years ago I wrote a song about Russia for the White Album, back when it wasn't fashionable for English people to say nice things about your country. 'That song had one of my favourite Beatles lines in it: ""Been away so long I hardly knew the place, gee it's good to be back home."" Could you make that come true for the Greenpeace prisoners?' This morning, after releasing the letter on his website, he tweeted: 'The Russian Ambassador kindly responded saying that their situation ""is not properly represented in the world media""'. Ship: The Arctic Sunrise was boarded by Russian authorities during the protest . Footage was found which showed the moment the Greenpeace ship was raided by Russian special services . The private letter, written on October 14, added: 'I understand of course that the Russian courts and the Russian Presidency are separate. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has said the situation is not being properly represented in the world media . 'Nevertheless I wonder if you may be able to use whatever influence you have to reunite the detainees with their families?' 'I am writing to assure you that the Greenpeace I know is most certainly not an anti-Russian organisation...And above all else they are peaceful. In my experience, non-violence is an essential part of who they are.' Kumi Naidoo, executive director of Greenpeace International, said: 'Sir Paul's letter is an extraordinary and beautiful plea for justice from one of the 20th century's most famous icons, and it went straight into the inbox of President Putin himself. 'We know some of the Arctic 30 are able to listen to the radio in their cells, and some of them are no doubt Beatles fans, so this news would be music to their ears. 'Sir Paul is hugely respected in Russia, and so we hope his letter brings the day closer when those 30 brave men and women are back with their families.' Greenpeace said more than two million people have sent letters and emails calling for the Arctic 30 to be released.","Former-Beatle told Putin campaigners should be reunited with families .

A stray kitten that spent a year recuperating with an animal rescue group after getting plucked from the streets of a flood-ravaged section of Brooklyn has finally been adopted - by a fellow Superstorm Sandy refugee. The little white cat, named Joy, was the last of nearly 300 stray and displaced pets that wound up in an American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals shelter after the storm. Lucky: Joy the cat (pictured with an ASPCA worker) has been adopted by Robert Curran from Brooklyn, New York . This week, she was getting used to her new home with Robert Curran, whose home and family business on New York City's Rockaway Peninsula were also partially destroyed. Curran said he reached out to the ASPCA after The Associated Press wrote about the group's attempt to find Joy a permanent home. 'She looked like she just needed some love and affection and a happy place to be,' said Curran. 'I said, 'You know what? I'm rebuilding my life. This cat needs help too'.' Joy was probably about six-months-old when she was found, skinny and skittish, on the streets of Brooklyn's Gravesend section last November. After the emergency shelter closed, she lived at the ASPCA's offices in Manhattan. The organization didn't initially put her up for adoption because she was initially terrified around people. By the storm's anniversary last month, she was playful and eating treats out of people's hands. Meanwhile, Curran relocated from the Queens seashore to Brooklyn after Sandy's tidal surge pushed several feet of water into the P.J. Curran Bar & Grill, which his family has owned for decades. His apartment, above the bar, lost its heating and electrical systems. The place still hasn't reopened, and Curran said he doesn't know if it ever will. 'We're dealing with insurance issues. We're dealing with the future of the block,' he said. 'Remember, you're talking about putting an entertainment business back in an area where everyone lost their life savings ... Who has money to go out on a Friday night?' Still, Curran's a survivor. And, so far, Joy has proven to be one, too. 'She's adorable,' he said, adding that the transition has gone smoother than expected. 'I expected not to see her for two weeks. But she's been fine.'","Joy, an 18-month-old kitten injured during Superstorm Sandy, will be adopted .

High-ranking officials at the FBI and Department of Homeland Security purposely stalled the investigation that exposed the affair between CIA Director David Petraeus and his biographer until after the 2012 presidential election, claims the agent who started the probe. FBI Agent Fred Humphries says he was told by his bosses at the bureau that the investigation would be concluded 'quietly' after voters went to the polls - but not until then. NBC News reports that Humphries told his former supervisor and two Republican Congressmen, including House Majority Whip Eric Cantor, that he believed FBI higher-ups were interfering with the investigation for political reasons. Exposed: Revelations of the affair between CIA Director David Petraeus and his biographer, Paula Broadwell, shocked the nation . Outed: Veteran FBI agent Fred Humphries was targeted after he went to Republican Congressmen with allegations of the CIA director's infidelity. This shirtless picture of him was leaked . Humphries is now under investigation by the FBI's internal affairs division for an 'unauthorized disclosure' during the investigation. Charles Mandigo, Humphries' former supervisor who led the FBI's Seattle field office, told NBC that Humphries believed he had to go outside of the chain of command in order to ensure the Petraeus investigation would be completed and not swept under the rug. Three days after President Barack Obama was reelected last November, Petraeus issued a statement admitted that he had had an affair and that he was resigning from the CIA. The revelation shocked the nation, but Humphries feared that it may have never been made public. The affair began to unravel in June 2012 when Jill Kelley, a socialite in Tampa Bay, Florida, told Humphries - a longtime friend - that she was receiving threatening emails from a user with the handles 'Tampa Angel' and 'Kelley Patrol.' Agents later tracked the emails back to Paul Broadwell, Petraeus' biographer. They discovered that she had been having an affair with the former four-star general that began while she was working on her book about him, All In. Friends: Jill Kelley, who started the investigation that led to Petraeus' ouster, befriended the general when he was living in Tampa . Kelley, the wife of a prominent Tampa doctor, served as a volunteer civilian liaison to MacDill Air Force Base, where Petreaus and his wife had been stationed when he served as head of the military's Central Command. Petreaus struck up a friendship with Kelley and Broadwell feared he was having an affair with her, as well. Humphries, a 17-year FBI veteran with a distinguished counter-terrorism record, wasn't leading the investigation, but regularly checked in. 'He said at one point, he had been told, just sit back and wait. Once the election is over, this will be quietly handled and it will all be resolved,' Mandigo told NBC. That message, he said, came from a senior agent in Tampa. The new information comes to light as Kelley prepares to file a lawsuit against the FBI for its handling of the case. She claims that agents deliberately leaked her name to the public and then leaked emails between her and another general, George Allen, to insinuate an affair between them and smear her name. She says she was also accused of having an affair with Humphries.","Agent Fred Humphries, who started the investigation, says he faced political interference from FBI higher-ups .

A Chinese boy is fighting for his life after his mother forced him to drink petrol and then set him on fire. Authorities said the four-year-old was abused then torched in a grotesque plot by his mother to get revenge on her husband who she felt was not treating her with the 'proper respect'. The tragedy happened in the city of Jinhua in Zhejiang province in the east of China. Scroll down for video . Horrific: A Chinese boy fights for life in intensive care after allegedly being forced to drink petrol and then set alight by his mother after arguing with her husband that she wasn't being treated with respect . Grotesque plot: Authorities said the four-year-old (pictured before the attack) was abused then torched by his mother to get revenge on her husband . Neighbours said that the woman and her husband were frequently arguing about money. The woman, 40-year-old Shen Dan, and the man, 48-year-old Zhang Qiusheng, were both divorced and had then married each other. Before their marriage, Zhang lived with her daughter, Zhang Mengting, who is a college student now. After they were married Zhang and Shen had their own son, a boy called Duoduo. But the two were always rowing about money. At the start of this month the woman - after a particularly heated argument - had left the apartment to return with a can of petrol. She had then tried to force her son to drink it but had only been partially successful as the boy had tried to fight once the first sip had gone into his mouth. Getting a divorce: The boy's father Zhang Qiusheng (pictured) was also badly burnt after he tried to intervene when the mother reportedly dragged his son towards a naked flame on the stove . 'I hope I never have to see her again': Zhang Qiusheng suffered 15 per cent burns over his body . As his father tried to intervene, she dragged the boy towards the naked flame on the gas stove, spilling petrol over all three of them - and they then all caught fire. Despite the burns, the father rushed with the boy into the living room where he wrapped his head in a blanket to extinguish the flames. The boy is now in intensive care. Doctors say the boy has 35 per cent burns mainly over his head, but also that his lungs had been badly damaged from the petrol and the flames. Even if he survives they say he will almost certainly not be able to speak and will most likely be blind. The woman and her husband were also hospitalised with 15 per cent burns over their body. The woman faces criminal charges once the police investigation is complete - but for Zhang his world has ended. He said: 'I just can't understand it, she had disputes with me about money and she was so furious and angry that she felt the need to lash out by injuring that which was most important to me - my darling son. He's her son too, I just don't understand it. 'I hope I never have to see her again - I will certainly be getting a divorce soon as I can get out of here and find a lawyer.'","Shen Dan 'hatched sick plot to get revenge on husband  Zhang Qiusheng'

The Border Patrol chief in San Diego says agents can continue using deadly force against rock-throwers, despite the recommendation of a government-commissioned review to end the practice. The Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit group that advises law enforcement agencies, recommended that the Border Patrol and its parent agency, Customs and Border Protection, stop the use of deadly force against rock throwers and assailants in vehicles, Border Patrol Chief Mike Fisher said. Both recommendations were part of a broader internal review of CBP's use-of-force policies and practices that began last year. U.S. border patrol agents examine the area near where 14-year-old Mexican youth Sergio Adrian Hernandez Huereca was killed, allegedly shot by a U.S. Border Patrol agent, in 2010 . The measures were not included in a revised policy announced on Sept. 25 that calls for more training and better record-keeping. CBP considered the proposed curbs 'very restrictive', Fisher told The Associated Press. Under current policy, agents can use deadly force if they have a reasonable belief that their lives or the lives of others are in danger. 'We shouldn't have carve-outs in our policy and say, except for this, except for that,' Fisher said. 'Just to say that you shouldn't shoot at rock-throwers or vehicles for us, in our environment, was very problematic and could potentially put Border Patrol agents in danger.' CBP has not released the full findings of the Police Executive Research Forum. Fisher's comments are the most publicly detailed about them. U.S. border patrol vehicle drives along the U.S.-Mexico border fence near Yuma, Arizona . The internal review began last year after 16 members of Congress raised concern about the May 2010 killing of Anastasio Hernandez, an unarmed Mexican who died from stun gun wounds at San Diego's San Ysidro port of entry. Authorities have said he was being combative while being returned to Mexico. The Justice Department is investigating that killing. Hernandez was one of 20 people killed by CBP officials since 2010, including eight who died in rock-throwing incidents with Border Patrol agents, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Fisher repeated the agency's long-standing position that rocks are lethal weapons. Smugglers have long pelted agents with rocks, bottles and other objects — often from Mexico — hoping to create an opening elsewhere along the border when agents rush to assist colleagues being pelted. Agents were attacked with rocks 339 times in the 2011 fiscal year, more than any other type of assault, according to the Department of Homeland Security inspector general. They responded with gunfire 33 times and with less-than-lethal force — a category that includes pepper spray and batons — 118 times. Migrants look at a U.S. Border Patrol car from the Mexican side of the U.S.-Mexico border in Tijuana, Mexico . Rock attacks fell to 185 in the 2012 fiscal year, the second most common type of assault. Agents fired a gun 22 times and responded 42 times with less-than-lethal force. The proposed ban on firing at vehicles would have brought the Border Patrol in line with some metropolitan police departments, Fisher said. But he pointed out that the federal agency operates in much different terrain. 'You don't want to just start shooting indiscriminately at a vehicle and try to blow out tires like they do on TV, but our environment is totally different,' Fisher said. 'In many cases, unlike a concrete jungle, you have a very narrow trail and the Border Patrol agent doesn't always have the ability to get out of the way.' Activists were disappointed that CBP rejected the recommendations. 'We've long held that deadly force should be limited to the most exceptional circumstances,' said Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego, who attended a meeting with Obama administration officials at the White House in September that covered the topic. 'The Border Patrol has yet to demonstrate that that's the appropriate level of force in the cases that have happened,' Guerrero said. Shawn Moran, spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing Border Patrol officers, welcomed the agency's position. 'Almost every Border Patrol agent has been rocked at one point or another,' Moran said. 'I know agents here that have had vehicles accelerate toward them, attempt to run them down.' Fisher rejected any suggestion that Border Patrol agents were trigger-happy. 'When you look at that environment, that workspace, I think our agents show a great deal of restraint when it comes to use of deadly force,' he said.","20 people have been killed by CBP officials since 2010 .

A South Florida nudist facing child porn charges has claimed photos of his three daughters, aged 8 to 12, are family portraits. Brian Martens, who lives at a Palm Beach nudist colony, claimed there was nothing sexual about the photos, which were taken by a neighbor who has since been convicted of child pornography. Martens admits he gave professional photographer Leslie Grey Vanaman permission to take pictures of his daughters, but at least one photo was a close up of a girl's genital area, investigators claimed. Family friendly: Brian Martens was living at the Sunsport Gardens naturist resort with his three daughters . A grand jury has voted that there is enough evidence to indict 53-year-old Martens on one count of producing child pornography and one count of receiving it, according to the Sun Sentinel. At a hearing on Wednesday Magistrate Judge Bill Matthewman agreed, and told the court: 'Several of these photos the court has . reviewed are lascivious ... They are, in the court's opinion, sexually . explicit.' Martens, who passed a background check before moving to the Sunsport Gardens Family Naturist Resort, was investigated earlier this year after Homeland Security found inappropriate photos of his children on Vanaman's computer. The Sunsport Gardens nudist colony was founded by Hugo Forester in 1965, as a 'happy place for all living things'. He turned a 40-acre tomato farm into a tropical resort with swimming pools, saunas and volleyball facilities. The family friendly resort has a community of permanent residents as well as cabins and camping facilities for visitors. Everyone must have membership to the resort, which does background checks. Membership fees start at $487 for a year. Nudity is expected, weather permitting, but in the pool and sauna everyone must be naked. The resort reminds first-time visitors that it is polite to maintain eye contact and not 'gawk'. Sunsport has no liquor license and smoking has been banned, though guests are asked to carry a towel to sit on at all times. Written permission is needed before taking photos in communal parts of the resort. Vanaman, the owner of A Shade of Grey Photography, is serving a 60-year sentence after pleading guilty to receiving and possessing child pornography. An attorney for Martens has agreed that one of the photos was pornographic but argued that his client didn't know it existed and hadn't given permission for it to be taken when he hired Vanaman to take professional portraits. 'The girls have no clothes on … but . they're not doing anything of a sexual nature,' Mr Eisenberg said. 'In . the context that everybody in this family are naturists … these photos . are not lewd or pornographic in any way. Martens, who is raising his daughters alone, 'cried when he viewed the images,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Brandy Brentari Galler said. Martens' daughters have been taken into protective custody. Their mother lives . in Illinois and was said to have supported their decision to live year-round in a . nudist colony with their father. He claimed he had only given permission for naturist photos to be taken, but an investigation of Martens' computer revealed he had signed releases and received more than 50 photos containing child pornography between 2010 and 2012, Mr Galler told the court. Emails between Martens, Vanaman and a third unidentified man discussed the 'sensuality and sexuality' of the images, agents claimed. Vetted: Sunsport Gardens' spokesman Morley Schloss says residents undergo background checks before being allowed to move to the Florida site . Martens also allegedly claimed his daughters 'opened doors' for him in the naturist community, investigators said. None . of the photos depicted sexual activity or adults abusing children, the . agents said, adding that some of the photos showed scenes such as the . girls baking cookies while naked. Jailed: Leslie Grey Vanaman is serving a 60-year-sentence for child pornography . The prosecution argued however that . images not shown in court were more disturbing, including ones of girls . in 'sexually suggestive poses'. The . prosecution is arguing that the definition of child porn is images . designed to evoke a sexual response and don't have to be explicit. Martens' daughters are currently in foster care but they are expected to be returned to their mother. Morley Schloss, spokesman for Sunsport Gardens, said the . allegations against Martens and Vanaman were an isolated aberration. 'We investigate . people, and Mr Martens had no record of any kind,' Mr Schloss said. 'We would never tolerate any . exploitation.' He told WPBF 25 after Vanaman's arrest that the photographer had passed a background check. The community also has strict rules about taking photographs in common areas. Martens, who has pleaded not guilty, could face between 15 and 30 years in federal prison if convicted of the . child porn production charge, and 5 to 20 years if convicted of . receiving child pornography. He has been kept in custody with bond after a judge ruled he was a flight risk and posed 'a clear risk of danger to the community, and specifically to his daughters'.","53-year-old raising three girls alone at Florida nudist colony had nude images on computer .

But Ed Balls took the battle to a new level today when he appeared to tease David Cameron about only needing a small towel to preserve his modesty on the beach. The shadow chancellor was greeted with nervous laughter and bemused stares of incomprehension from delegates at the Labour party conference. The Prime Minister was snapped on a Cornish beach last month performing the time-honoured dancing of trying to change out of his trunks while maintaining a degree of decency and dignity. Having deftly completed the tricky manoeuvre, Mr Cameron then went on to remove his trusty polo shirt to reveal an ample - and very red - torso.

Robust: The CPS has unveiled strict rules that would take pay-as-you-go phones from gang members . Gang members will be banned from wearing hoodies, owning pay-as-you-go phones, and riding bicycles in a new set of measures to break up their activities. They will also be banished from the postcode their gang operates in. The set of court orders was announced today by the new head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Baljit Ubhey. She told the Evening Standard: ‘It’s being able to identify people and limit the type of activity that they get involved in that would support ongiong gang activity. ‘Curtailing people’s ability to associate post-conviction is also a really good way to prevent further gang activity.' She added: ‘We need to make sure that the Crown . Prosecution Service is taking a really robust line when it comes to . prosecuting gang crime. 'This has such an impact on communities that we’ve really got to take a very tough line.' However, Colin James, the founder and senior mentor of Gangs Unite, blasted the measures as 'ridiculous' that 'will just make everything harder'. He told MailOnline: 'I think some of those measures are ridiculous. Banning hoodies in the winter is just unfair. Do we stop everyone from wearing hoodies? Just stop making them. And bicycles - how is that going to help? 'I can understand that if they've got a phone in their name, they are then accountable for it. But the bicycle is going too far, and hoodies is going too far. 'They have done the robust approach. It . is all robust, robust, robust. It means there are more obstacles than . support so I think a little bit more effort should be put into support.' Hoodie ban: Gang members (posed by models) would be banned from wearing hoodies in the new measures . Disagree: Colin James (right), founder and senior mentor of Gangs Unite, blasted the measures outlined today by Baljit Ubhey (left) as 'too robust'. He said the 'American-style' system provides too many obstacles to youths . He attacked the notion of specific 'gang prosecutors' as 'American': 'We are going too far in our American-style approach. We need to look at it from An English perspective and come up with an approach that works. Tragic: Jimmy Mizen, 16, was murdered by Jake Fahri, 19, in May 2008 whilst at the Three Cook's Bakery in Lee, South East London . 'The more rules and boundaries there are will just make them rebel more. 'We need to look at the reasons behind what they are doing and work with them.' Junior Smart, founder of St Giles Trust SOS project, one of London's leading gang intervention services, also warned against  strict measures. He told MailOnline: 'Enforcement measures such as those outlined here have their place when applied appropriately and take into account the situation of the individual concerned. 'However, in our experience in providing one of London's largest gang intervention projects, they absolutely must be accompanied with a package of support which addresses the reasons why young people are involved in gangs and which helps them leave gangs safely and permanently.' Prince Charles has also announced his own volunteer-based initiative to deal with the soaring rates of violence among young people on Britain's streets. It is a far cry from the strict, 'robust' lines Ms Ubhey is proposing to draw to curb violence. Moved by the murder of 16-year-old Jimmy Mizen in 2008, the heir to the throne is leading an event called #iwill in Buckingham Palace next week. Flanked by 50 young people, David Cameron and Nick Clegg, he will make a plea for more to be invested in groups such as The Guides and Scouts to give gang members 'a rite of passage'. He said: 'The Mizens are convinced – as I have been for the past 40 years – that part of the solution  is in providing more structured activities for young people. 'In my opinion, tragedies such as the murder of Barry and Margaret’s son are the extreme result of too many young people no longer guided through a rite of passage; young people who would benefit from the guidance and help of organisations such as the Guides, Scouts, cadets and other youth organisations. 'However, these are all groups which are hampered in their growth by a lack of adult volunteers. 'That vision is that all of us, from all walks of life, will ‘step up’ and pledge, at #iwill, to help young people take every opportunity to be of service to others. Initiative: Prince Charles, here with . Barry and Margaret Mizen, is promoting volunteer-based gang initiatives . 'I know that young people have an immense contribution to  make to our society, but I have long believed we are failing to do enough to unlock their talent and unleash their energies to help tackle all sorts of challenges. 'Young people are the solution to so much and yet, too frequently, they are seen as the problem.'","Baljit Ubhey, new head of CPS, announced new 'robust' court orders .

Animation legend Joseph Barbera’s first ever cartoons which paved the way for Tom and Jerry, The Flintstones and Yogi Bear have gone on sale for £15,000. Barbera drew Kiko the Kangaroo in 1935 while working as a junior animator at the Terrytoons studio, home of Mighty Mouse and Deputy Dawg. It was the first cartoon the young designer had written and storyboarded and was based around an aeroplane race between Kiko and a mustachioed dog called Dirty Doug. Creative: Barbera drew Kiko the Kangaroo in 1935 while working as a junior animator at the Terrytoons studio, home of Mighty Mouse and Deputy Dawg . The cartoon gave Barbera, who was just 24 at the time, the confidence to go into storytelling and as a result he formed a historic partnership with director William Hanna. Together the pair created some of the most iconic cartoons ever made, also including The Jetsons, Wacky Races, Scooby-Doo and Huckleberry Hound. Barbera had been working for cartoonist Paul Terry at his Terrytoons studio working on Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle when he attempted his first cartoon. Amazingly, it was Terry’s indifference at Barbera’s creation that persuaded him to leave the company and join MGM, where he met Hanna. The first cartoon was based around an aeroplane race between Kiko and a mustachioed dog called Dirty Doug . The two formed Hanna-Barbera in 1957 and remained directors until their deaths. Barbera died in Los Angeles in 2006 aged 95 while Hanna passed away in 2001 aged 90. The sketches are being sold by Barbera’s nephew Larry, who was given them by Barbera’s mother Francesca. They have been sketched using graphite and pencil on special animation paper, and measure 8ins by 6ins. The 43 storyboards are tipped to fetch £15,000 when they go under the hammer. Jim Lentz, director of animation art at Heritage Auctions, said: 'The story of Joe Barbera’s first cartoon is a fascinating one. 'He was working in the clean-up department at Terrytoons when he decided he wanted to have a go at writing a story. Up for grabs: Joseph Barbera's first ever cartoon paved the way for Tom and Jerry and The Flintstones . The sketches belong to Barbera's nephew Larry and are being sold by Heritage Auctions in Los Angeles . The cartoon gave Barbera, who was just 24 at the time, the confidence to go into storytelling and as a result he formed a historic partnership with director William Hanna . 'So he sat down and drew a complete cartoon of Kiko the Kangaroo which was then shown to company boss Paul Terry. 'Terry took a look at the drawings, shrugged his shoulders and told Barbera to get back to work. 'Barbera knew he could write cartoon stories so at that point he decided to leave Terrytoons to join the newly formed MGM cartoon department. 'That’s when he met William Hanna and they began an historic partnership that created some of the world’s most famous cartoons. Barbera (right) went on to create cartoon characters like Fred Flintstone (left) after teaming up with Hanna . 'Had Paul Terry reacted differently to Barbera’s cartoon history could have worked out much differently. 'Joe Barbera was an incredible guy and a brilliant storyteller. 'In the 1940s and 50s when Disney was in its heyday, Tom and Jerry was winning Academy Awards. 'Barbera’s cartoons were so good they made it onto prime time television - he was effectively the Godfather of Saturday morning TV. 'This cartoon storyboard is very significant - it is the birthplace of some of the best and most historic cartoons ever made. 'It has been in the Barbera family ever since it was drawn. 'Animation is enjoying a renaissance now as the digital generation rediscovers these beautiful hand-drawn creations.'

Publishers should stick the Government’s plans for a Royal Charter on Press regulation ‘in the privy’, Boris Johnson said yesterday. The London Mayor urged all editors to follow the example of The Spectator magazine, which has said it has no intention of abiding by the new system, which gives a statutory basis to a new media regulator. Mr Johnson said he was pleased the magazine ‘has told the Privy Council to stick its charter in the privy’, and he urged ‘all other editors to follow suit’. Last month, politicians agreed the detail of a charter enshrining a system of newspaper regulation in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into media standards. An alternative proposal put forward by the Press, which would have meant a new independent regulator having strong investigative powers and the right to impose fines of up to £1million for wrongdoing, up-front corrections, with inaccuracies corrected fully and prominently, and independence from the industry and politicians, was rejected. The Spectator has already announced that it will refuse to take part in the Government’s new system of regulation. The Government has passed legislation meaning that newspapers that refuse to join a regulator approved under its charter will be hit with ‘exemplary’ damages in libel cases. However, senior figures including Lord Lester, an eminent QC who is the architect of reforms to Britain’s notorious libel laws, have suggested that will violate Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects freedom of expression.

And now one veggie-loving juice company thinks that we should be slurping our sprouts the rest of winter too. The UK's first ever Brussels sprout juice has been launched by Juice Club, going on sale at the exclusive food store Fortnum & Mason. Hoping to become this season's super juice staple, this intriguing health drink promises to deliver lots of health benefits and help keep bugs at bay. Can you stomach it? Juice Club have launched the first-ever Brussels sprout juice and it is available now at luxury store, Fortnum & Mason . The makers claim the juice offers a 'distinctly clean and punchy way to enjoy the Yuletide super food' and they're convinced it will rival the oh-so-virtuous kale in the health stakes. Sprouts are rich in vitamin C and K, which helps fight off infection. They also contain sulforaphane, which reduces risk from cancer, as well as lowering cholesterol. For those hard-core vegetable juice . addicts (yes you, Miranda Kerr), the Brussels sprout can be combined with spinach and kale or . enjoyed as a clean shot on its own. For the less adventurous foodies, the sprouts can be mixed into a punchy £3.95 concoction of pears, cinnamon and spices or apples and cranberry. Will they dare? Miranda Kerr (L) and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley are huge super juice fans, but will Brussels sprout juice become their new health essential? Dan Thomson, bartender of cult cocktail bars B.Y.O.C and Milk & Honey, said: 'The limited edition flavours are . perfectly enjoyed on a chilly morning walk to work or to revitalise . yourself before another festive party.' Elouise Bauskis, Nutritional Therapist at The Nutri Centre said: 'Brussela sprouts are a Cruciferous vegetable that are packed with vitamin K, vitamin C, folic acid, calcium and magnesium. 'As a juice I’d imagine the taste may be very intense, but by adding pear, cinnamon and spice or apples and cranberry would surely improve it. Combined with spinach and kale it’d become a super shot of green goodness. 'If you have thyroid issues, I wouldn’t have it too often, as Brussels sprouts are goitrogenic especially when consumed raw, meaning they can interfere with the absorption of iodine, which is essential for thyroid function.'' Jessica Anderson from Jessica's Recipe Bag food blog, said: 'Brussels sprouts are considered to be a super food. They are packed with numerous vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytochemicals. Good stuff: Brussels sprouts provide a good source of vitamin A, B6, C, E, K, potassium, manganese, folate acid, iron, glucosinolates, riboflavin, and thiamin . 'Brussels sprouts juice does provide a great source of vitamin A, B6, C, E, K, potassium, manganese, folate acid, iron, glucosinolates, riboflavin, and thiamin. By juicing Brussels sprouts, it allows your body to absorb all the nutrients found inside easier than if eaten. 'Many people find that Brussels sprouts are difficult to digest and cause bloating therefore juicing them is a good alternative . 'I do not support the claim that this juice is sure to keep winter infections at bay, it may help if used in combination with a balanced diet. Stress and lack of sleep also effect our immune system. 'I saw that you can buy a small shot of Brussels sprout juice for £2.00. A typical shot is around 50ml. You can buy 1 Kg of sprouts for less then £2 and make more then 10 shots with a good juicer. 'It concerns me that we are buying into the premise that juicing is a quick fix to optimising our health where as in fact juices like these are expensive and not a substitute for healthy eating.'

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced today that the marathon will take place on Sunday despite earlier rumors that the race would be delayed. 'The marathon will go on,' Mr Bloomberg said Wednesday. 'Most of the power will be back if not all of it.' There are still concerns, however, that many of the 50,000 runners won't be able to make it to the start line at Staten Island, as New York's subway system is flooded, the Staten Island Ferry is suspended and many flights to the city's airports cancelled. Closed: The Staten Island Ferry terminal at Battery Park in lower Manhattan will be used by about half of the 50,000 runners in Sunday's New York City Marathon . Carnage: A station on the Staten Island Railway covered in debris in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. It is unknown whether public transport will be back to normal by Sunday . Spectacular: The 26.2 mile course takes in all five of New York's boroughs . Runners have been given until Saturday to cancel their entry. 'The marathon is much more than a race and once again it's so true this year as was the case after 9/11, to deliver an event that can aid New York City's recovery,' Mary Wittenberg, the New York Road Runners president and CEO, said to USA Today. Up to 20,000 international runners could be affected by flight cancellations and delays, though Wittenburg said the organisation had 'a number of options to get them into any of our surrounding airports.' There was a positive sign on Wednesday morning with the re-opening of JFK and Newark airports. The group said that any runners unable to reach Manhattan would be entered into next year's race, though entry fees would not be refunded. About half of the runners will reach the start via the Staten Island Ferry from the Battery and though the service should be operational, it is by no means guaranteed that Subway trains to the Battery will be.

The start line on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is elevated but the first portion of the course in Brooklyn, along Fourth Avenue, isn't far from areas flooded on Monday night. Similarly, there could be problems when the course passes through Queens, close to the East River. The finish line is in Central Park, which will remain closed until the debris and fallen trees are cleared away.

Jailed: Michael Goldsmith, 43, of Anglesey, arranged to meet men at hotels in Bangor and Menai Bridge . A Harrow-educated conman who failed to deliver on his promise to pay a male escort's £11,000 university fees in return for sex has been jailed. Michael Goldsmith, 43, of Anglesey, North Wales - educated at Harrow School in North-West London - had previously been sent to prison for a similar offence, Mold Crown Court heard. He had arranged to meet men at hotels in Bangor and Menai Bridge through mobile phone app Grindr and the Hello Boys website - and promised to pay a male escort £11,000 for sex. He made a cheque out to a university so that he could pay for his course - and also wrote out a £5,000 personal cheque to the male escort, who was in his 20s and doing a master's degree. But both bounced and he also left the hotel without paying for the room, said Simon Rogers, prosecuting. Sexual activity took place between the two men before Goldsmith contacted other men via the app on his phone and another male joined them. Goldsmith said he wanted to watch them performing sex acts. The defendant left, saying he was married and had to return to his family - but arranged to see the escort the following day. He turned up, then said he had to leave because his wife had followed him, and claimed he would return with cash instead of the cheques. But he never did, the court was told. The man, who was registered with an escort service, presented the cheques - but they bounced. On another occasion, Goldsmith promised to pay a man £1,000 after posting a picture of someone other than himself on the app. He posed as a young man in his 20s, and said he was handsome. Liasons: Goldsmith had arranged to meet men at hotels in Bangor and Menai Bridge through mobile phone app Grindr (file picture) and the Hello Boys website - and promised to pay a male escort £11,000 for sex . That man initially refused to get involved and deleted the app. But he later saw a true picture of the defendant when he reloaded the app and realised it was the same man. He was persuaded by the offer of money to meet him in a hotel. In the room he was told they would discuss money later, and Goldsmith watched as he and another young man performed sex acts. But he left without paying and when later contacted, the defendant told him: ‘Why should I pay you and that d*******. You were c*** anyway.’ Goldsmith told him to ‘learn by his mistakes’ and said ‘you never know who you might meet out there.’ Jailing him for two years, Judge Niclas Parry branded him a cruel conman who placed no value on decency. Goldsmith sought to satisfy his sexual desires on the basis of lies and deceit. Goldsmith had done precisely the same thing in 2005, 2008 and 2011. He was on licence from a previous prison sentence when he committed the latest offences. Hearing: Mold Crown Court (pictured) was told he had previously been sent to prison for a similar offence . The judge said it ‘beggar's belief’ that some of his victims were prepared to accept payment for sexual services by cheque - and that they considered someone like him as someone capable of trust. It was a very unusual case of fraud for which he considered the sentencing guidelines did not apply, he said. Richard Thomas, defending, said that his client came from a wealthy family and was educated at Harrow. But within a matter of months or weeks of being released from prison he committed the same sort of offences again. His only explanation was that when he returned home to Anglesey he felt isolated there. He did not have anything to do and fell back into the same pattern of offending. Mr Thomas said that while the offences were based on sexual activity, he stressed that his client had been charged with fraud only and that the young men had entered into the agreements voluntarily. Goldsmith knew that if he continued to behave in such a way then he would spend large parts of his adult life in custody, Mr Thomas said. But he added Goldsmith had met a young man in custody and it was hoped the relationship would blossom. ‘If that is the case then he will have no need to get involved in such offending,’ he said.","Michael Goldsmith had previously been imprisoned for similar offence .

A grandfather blasted a 'jobsworth' bus driver who refused to let him use his OAP pass because he was just two minutes early. Frail Bernard Palfrey, 79, was forced to walk more than a mile from his home in Hereford to his doctor's appointment just two weeks after suffering a stroke. The retired engineer planned to catch the First Midlands Red number 71 bus after medics told him not to drive for three months. Too early: Bernard Palfrey, 79, from Hereford, was unable to use is bus pass because he was two minutes early . But he was stunned when the female driver told him he was just two minutes early to use his bus pass - which is only valid after 9.30am. Dad-of-three Mr Palfrey, who only had £1 in his pocket so couldn't afford the £1.90 fare, was then forced to walk to his 10am doctor's appointment. It took the pensioner - who suffered a mini-stroke two weeks earlier on August 19 - 30 minutes to make the mile-long trek to his GP's surgery. Mr Palfrey, who also suffered a second stroke on October 28, hit out at the 'jobsworth' driver for not bending the rules. He said: 'I was told the bus pass wasn't valid before half past nine. 'She said she couldn't accept the bus pass and was full of apologies but said all tickets are time marked. Bus stop: The retired engineer planned to catch the First Midlands Red number 71 bus after medics told him not to drive for three months following a stroke . 'I had a pound in my pocket because I wasn't intending on spending any money and asked how much the fare was. 'The driver said it was £1.90 and that threw me. 'I didn't have time to go home and get money so decided to walk to the doctors. I got there just in time for the appointment at 10am so it took me almost half an hour.' Mr Palfrey said he didn't accept the driver's apology. 'She was extremely apologetic but I would say she was a jobsworth.' He continued, 'I think she was too apprehensive about risking her job by doing something that wasn't in her company rules. 'I was in a job role where I managed 30 to 40 people and know you can bend the rules sometimes.'It's been an extremely difficult time for me and I could've done without it.' Walk: Dad-of-three Bernard, who only had £1 in his pocket so couldn't afford the £1.90 fare . Widowed MR Palfrey, whose wife Marilyn passed away aged 75 two years ago, said his three children were furious about his treatment. He said: 'My children have said what she could have done is let me go to the back of the bus and then swiped the card at the next stop because it would have been after half 9 by then.' His daughter Susan Clarke added: 'The next stop was only 100 yards down the road and the bus wasn't full so surely he could have stayed on until then. 'They say they don't know everyone's personal circumstances and they wouldn't have known he had suffered a stroke but you only need to look at my dad to know he is old. 'He is an old man with health problems and he doesn't need to be treated this way. 'All my dad wanted was an apology but they are so unsympathetic because they are a big company and think they can get away with it. 'They apologised to me by email but my dad has had nothing at all.' Defending the driver, First Midlands Red spokesman Ady Culpin said the driver was left with no choice. He added: 'Our drivers are challenged regularly about the 9.30am threshold. 'Our ticket machines are programmed to comply with the local authority scheme and we are obliged to adhere to this. 'These situations are always going to be difficult for our drivers to deal with. 'As stated by the gentleman, our driver was apologetic and explained the situation to him.

A new six-runway hub airport to the east of London could be built within seven years at a cost of £47.3billion. However, the ambitious plans would require the closure of Heathrow airport, which employs 76,000 people. The proposed new airport would sit on a purpose-built island off the Isle of Sheppey in Kent in the Thames Estuary, some 50 miles east of central London, and would be known as London Britannia Airport. Soaring ambition: An artist's impression of the £47.3bn London Britannia Airport, which would be built on an artificial island in the Thames Estuary . Rivals: As a result of Testrad's plans, Heathrow airport would likely have to close to accommodate the ambitious scheme . The British government and business . groups want to expand flights to fast-growing economies to ensure the UK . can tap into billions of pounds of trade opportunities. With Heathrow, . London's biggest airport, operating at 99 per cent capacity, more . runways are needed. However, the island airport has been criticised by environmental groups, who say the estuary is not just 'dead space waiting for development'. The proposal was released by Thames Estuary Research and Development (Testrad), a consortium formed by London Mayor Boris Johnson to address the capital's air capacity crunch. The plan, to be launched on Monday at the House of Lords, comes two years after architect Norman Foster unveiled proposals for a four-runway hub in the Thames Estuary, backed by Johnson and dubbed 'Boris Island'. The estuary airport is a passion project for Mr Johnson, who has blasted plans for a third - or even fourth - runway at Heathrow. He said any expansion will 'consign millions of Londoners to unacceptable levels of noise pollution', while a three-runway airport would be 'obsolete' as soon as it was built. Testrad said the new hub would have six runways and could be built within seven years without having to demolish houses or industrial infrastructure. It will also create 200,000 jobs. Testrad said the new hub would have six runways and could be built within seven years without having to demolish houses or industrial infrastructure .

'This project avoids flying over densely . populated areas of London and the south east, removing completely the . noise contours and impact which have bedevilled millions of people . throughout and around London over the past 40 years,' a Testrad . spokeswoman said. Testrad has proposed the Heathrow site is 'recycled' into a new borough for London, creating housing and business opportunities. It added: 'Under wartime legislation in 1944, the village of Heathrow and valuable farmland was requisitioned for a new military airfield. 'Relocation and recycling the tightly constrained Heathrow airport site as a city extension for London, will allow a transformation of acres of runway concrete into a real piece of city, with the return of bio-diversity, in gardens, lakes and a landscape park system full of trees, birds and other wildlife.' Proposed rail lines to link the airport to the capital, 50 miles away . Gateway: The British government and business groups want to expand flights to fast-growing economies to ensure the UK can tap into billions of pounds of trade opportunities . Vast: The outline of Heathrow in red above, superimposed over London. Testrad calls Heathrow 'highly constrained and overloaded' The Conservatives . last year set up the UK Airports Commission, chaired by Howard Davies, . to look into airport capacity in southern England. It is due to publish a . list of potential schemes by the end of this year with the final report . due after the 2015 general election. Earlier this year bosses at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports urged the government to let them build additional runways to solve the capacity shortage, plans vigorously opposed by Johnson. He previously proposed a new four-runway hub should be built either east of central London on the Isle of Grain or further out in the Thames Estuary on an artificial island. In July Mr Johnson, said: 'This is further welcome argument in favour of the feasibility of having a new hub airport in the Thames estuary. Officials at Heathrow (pictured) have vehemently opposed the plans, saying an extra runway is the solution to Britain's air capacity woes . The scheme has attracted condemnation from a number of environmental groups, notably Friends Of The Earth, WWF and Greenpeace UK. The Royal Society For The Protection Of Birds (RSPB) has also dismissed the campaign and says the consortium has failed to address the 'considerable' environmental issues. It said much of the estuary has international environmental protection and added that hundreds of thousands of birds use the estuary as a major migratory route, posing a considerable threat to planes from bird strike. Chris Corrigan, the RSPB’s Director for South East England said: 'Boris continues to pursue this pipe dream, but no amount of wishful thinking on his behalf changes the fact that the Thames Estuary is not dead space waiting for development. 'It is home to an immense number of birds and other wildlife. You can not recreate the estuary nor move the native or migratory wildlife that relies on it for food and shelter. 'I'm sure the Mayor doesn't want to go down in history as the man who decimated not just birds in the Thames, but global species too, while putting air passengers lives at risk due to bird strike. 'With so many options available for a multi-runway hub airport in a new location, it would be folly for the Airports Commission to give countenance to the prospect of expanding Heathrow, the most noise-polluting airport in Europe.' But Heathrow vehemently opposes the plans. In June Colin Matthews, CEO of Heathrow, said: 'Britain already has one of the world’s most successful international hub airports in Heathrow. 'Expanding Heathrow will put Britain ahead in the global race, connecting UK business to growth more quickly and at less cost to the taxpayer than any other option for new capacity. 'Heathrow is better located for passengers, business and jobs. Why build from scratch at a new hub when we can build on the strength that already exists around Heathrow today?'","The airport would sit on an artificial island 50 miles east of London .

Residents thought they would have to ride along a four-inch gap between the thick white line and the kerb, a daunting task for even the most experienced cyclist.

Baffling: Cyclists complained after it appeared council workers had painted a path for them four inches wide . Cyclist Ray Lawrance, 61, spotted the white line as he walked his two grandchildren to school. He said: 'As a layman looking at this, I am totally confused. Where is the cycle path, where is the pedestrian path? There's no clear definition which is which. Wheely confusing: The start of the bike path in Great Coates, Grimsby. Cyclists should ride on the left . 'It . is pointless. It does not appear to be the best use of public money. It . is probably to tick boxes to get a bit of central government funding . but it has left pedestrians and cyclists confused.' The line was painted last month on a residential street in the village of Great Coates, on the outskirts of Grimsby, as part of resurfacing work at a busy junction. Labour-controlled North East Lincolnshire Council insisted its intention was to mark out a shared space for cyclists and pedestrians, not to divide the path in two. A spokesman said: 'This is a commonly used marking to show where a cycle . path joins a footpath. Cyclists and pedestrians share the length of path . marked by the white line.' But Labour councillor Cliff Barber was forced to hold his hands up after the issue was raised at a community meeting on October 30. The path had been resurfaced following complaints from the public,' he said. 'It . was a very uneven surface with lots of holes in so they have completely . re-tarmacked it and they have done a good job, but I must admit the . newly painted line does look a bit narrow.' The council insisted the repainting was essential for the pavement, but declined to say whether they will change the original markings. Vic Goose, chairman of the North East Lincolnshire Cycle Forum, said: 'The cycle path has been there for some time and has always been a shared path. 'It is quite likely that the white line is to segregate the cycle path from the road.' The bizarre incident is certainly not the first questionable paint job by council workers. Contractors for Cumbria County Council last month painted the words KEEP CEEAR in huge white letters - before having to apologise and correct it for free. And workmen in Thatcham, Berkshire, were a laughing stock when they refused to let parked cars stop them doing their job - and simply painted double yellow lines between each one.","White line in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, was meant to mark 'shared pavement'

A cache of weapons including a 950,000 volt stun gun was discovered in the car of a taxi driver who said he was on his way to kill the Prime Minister, a court has heard. Police also found  hammers, kitchen knives, a machete, an unsheathed Samurai sword and masking tape in Irfaq Naz's Vauxhall Astra, when he was stopped after going the wrong way down a north London street. Officers later searched the . 34-year-old's home in Middlesbrough and found the Downing Street . postcode and the names of other prominent political figures. Discovery: Police found a cache of weapons including a 950,000 volt stun gun inside Irfaq Naz's Vauxhall Astra. The 34-year-old, shown leaving Teeside Crown Court inside this van, told officers he was on his way to kill the Prime Minister . The taxi driver was detained under . the Mental Health Act, and last month admitted possessing a prohibited . weapon, three counts of possessing an offensive weapon, seven counts of . having a bladed article and dangerous driving. Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, the Recorder of Middlesbrough, imposed a hospital order with a restriction order meaning Naz can only be released with the permission of the Home Secretary. Teesside Crown Court heard how he drove from Middlesbrough to London in the early hours of July 16 and by 4am had reached Kentish Town. He drove his blue Vauxhall Astra the wrong way down Camden High Street, a one-way street, for three-quarters of a mile, causing oncoming traffic to take evasive action. Police were called and tried to stop his car, but he carried on until he got caught in a jam at the junction with Euston Road. Concerned he might attempt to drive on, officers smashed their way into his car and detained him. 'It was then that the defendant stated that he was on his way to kill the Prime Minister, David Cameron,' Nick Dry, prosecuting, said. 'He was found to have a knuckleduster in his shirt pocket and an 18 inch hunting knife in the waistband of his trousers.' Police were concerned about his behaviour and found he had previously spent a month at Roseberry Park Hospital, Middlesbrough, as a mental health patient. Mr Dry added: 'A search of his vehicle revealed other weapons. 'In the driver’s door panel were three eight-inch kitchen knives. 'Between the driver’s seat and door was a samurai sword, its sheath found nearby in the passenger foot well. 'From the rear seat officers recovered a claw hammer, a lump hammer and an axe which were in a plastic bag that also contained masking tape. Detained: The court was told that Naz would reside at Roseberry Park Hospital in Middlesbrough. He was also disqualified from driving for three years and a judge ordered that the weapons be destroyed . 'In the boot they found a machete and a stun gun, shaped as a knuckleduster. 'That device, a Blast Knuckles 950,000 volt stun gun, was found to be in working order and a prohibited weapon.' Naz, of Finsbury Street, Middlesbrough, also had four mobile phones and £1,200 in cash in the car. Dr Pratish Thakkar, a consultant psychiatrist, diagnosed paranoid schnizophrenia and said he posed a significant risk to others having acted on his delusions. Naz, whose brother was in the public gallery, sat in the dock flanked by four mental health workers. He will reside at Roseberry Park Hospital, a mental health centre in Middlesbrough, where he has previously been treated. Peter Wishlade, defending, said: 'It is a tragedy, to put it bluntly, that this has happened to this family. 'Mr Naz, when he is taking his medication, is perfectly calm, rational, articulate and easy to talk to, but unfortunately when not, he is inclined to delusions and regrettably he has endeavoured to carry them out.' The judge felt his delusions, which included a desire to kill a world leader, posed a serious risk to the public. The court was told that Naz also believed the Mayor of Middlesbrough, Ray Mallon, and others in the community, were going to kill him. The judge disqualified him from driving for three years and ordered the weapons be destroyed. Outside court, Steven Orange, the district crown prosecutor for CPS Durham Tees, said: 'In the weeks before this incident Naz failed to take his medication which as a result has led to him having delusions. 'At the time of this incident he was therefore suffering from a major mental illness and his behaviour was undoubtedly influenced by the delusions he was having. 'His disorder will need psychological treatment in order to ensure compliance with medication and reduce the risk of him acting upon his delusions in the future.' Mr Orange added: 'It should be recognised that the sentence in this case is more about securing appropriate treatment for a man with significant mental health issues than punishment.'","Police found cache of weapons inside Irfaq Naz's Vauxhall Astra .

Fleury will walk free from jail next week after having his sentence halved . A driver who killed a father of two by driving on the wrong side of the road has been freed by Appeal Court judges because he is French. Alexis Sebastien Fleury had ‘lower culpability’ for causing the death of 62-year-old David Crane than a British driver would have done, the judges ruled. Mr Crane, of Rolvenden, Kent, was on his way home from work at 11.30pm on August 3, 2012, when his Skoda Fabia was hit head-on by Fleury’s grey Renault Laguna on the A28 near Tenterden. Charity fundraiser Mr Crane, who was a carer for his disabled wife,  suffered multiple injuries and died at the scene. Fleury was acquitted by a jury at Canterbury Crown Court of causing death by dangerous driving but was convicted of causing death by  careless driving in July and jailed for 18 months. Yesterday Lord Justice Lloyd Jones, Mr Justice Irwin and Mr Justice Green, sitting at London’s Criminal Appeal Court, halved that sentence to nine months – meaning 25-year-old Fleury will walk free next week. The court heard that Fleury from Orleans, central France, was driving to visit his English girlfriend, Emily Crick, in Wadhurst, East Sussex. He had travelled from France through the Eurotunnel. Fleury performed a U-turn and was driving down the wrong side of the road, when he crashed head-on into Mr Crane’s car. The Frenchman had been awake for 16 hours and had been driving for six and a-half hours at the time. But his lawyers argued that there was ‘no evidence’ that he had been tired, because he napped on the shuttle through the tunnel. Fleury said during his trial: ‘I missed my turning and decided to do a  U-turn. I was driving for a few seconds and saw headlights just in front of me and boom.’ Mr Justice Irwin said: ‘This young man made a mistake at the end of his journey. As a Frenchman, used to driving on the right-hand side of the road, he remained on the right-hand side of the road after his U-turn. He did a U-turn in the dark in England and, for moments or minutes, forgot that he was not driving in France. Ruling: Judges at the Appeal Court in the Royal Courts of Justice, pictured, ruled the driver was less culpable for the death of David Crane because he was not used to driving on the right-side of the road . ‘The culpability of a British driver in the same circumstances would have been very high indeed. For somebody from France, the culpability must  be reduced.’ Fleury’s lawyers said outside court that the reduced sentence means he will be released from prison at the beginning of  next week. Mr Justice Irwin expressed his sympathy for Mr Crane’s family, saying: ‘He was a very good and loving father to two daughters, and a husband who looked after his disabled partner. ‘They are all terribly distraught about their loss. It is clear that he was a good man and his death has caused great loss and pain.’","Alexis Sebastien Fleury had 'lower .

Conman: Adam Loveridge, 41, persuaded a vulnerable 64-year-old her porch and guttering needed fixing - and charged her £49,000 . A gypsy who charged a blind pensioner almost £50,000 for work worth just £1,000 has been jailed. Adam Loveridge, 41, cold-called at his victim's home and persuaded her that her porch and guttering needed fixing. He then billed the 64 year-old for a staggering £49,000 - which she began paying in installments. Over a year she paid out an extortionate £40,080 to Loveridge in a series of cheques until her bank became suspicious and contacted the police. Loveridge initially claimed he could not read the amounts on the cheques because of his illiteracy but he eventually admitted six counts of fraud. The conman, who lives on a caravan park in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, blew all but £3,000 of the money on gambling machines. Loveridge admitted six counts of fraud and was jailed for three-and-a-half years at Peterborough Crown Court. Recorder Richard Carey told him: 'What you did was to charge obscene amounts. 'You targeted a vulnerable victim and rejoiced in her money for more than a year.' Hugh Vass, prosecuting, said: 'Loveridge took £40,080 but he would have taken £9,000 more if the bank had not stopped payments. 'The victim is the stereotype vulnerable victim. She is a 69-year-old lady who lives alone and is totally blind. 'Loveridge cold called at her home and pressurised her into having work done. 'But being blind she could not see if the work had been completed or not.' Jailed: The man admitted six counts of fraud and was jailed for three and a half years at Peterborough Crown Court, pictured . Mr Vass said a surveyor visited the victim's house in Peterborough and concluded the work Loveridge did was worth no more than £1,000. Neil Corre, defending, claimed Loveridge had shown genuine empathy for his victim by pleading guilty. Peter Stonely, from Peterborough Trading Standards, said: 'The best advice we can give to elderly and vulnerable residents is never to deal with people who cold call at the doorstep.'","Adam Loveridge, 41, persuaded his 64-year-old victim her porch and guttering needed fixing and billed her for £49,000 .

It is often called the best kept secret in the City - company shares that come with lucrative perks. From discounted theme park tickets to Marks & Spencer shopping vouchers, firms are ramping up the freebies they hand out to small shareholders. Investors in luxury goods group Mulberry can get up to a fifth off its wares – potentially saving £300 on a £1,500 designer handbag. Incentive: Anybody who holds 250 shares in Mulberry can get 10 per cent off purchases worth more than £500 . More than 40 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange now offer such perks, according to Hargreaves Lansdown. Richard Hunter, head of equities at the stockbroker, said the trend became particularly popular in the 1990s. He said: ‘Companies jumped on the bandwagon as a means of getting to their shareholder base - after all, it is likely that a shareholder of the company will also be a customer.’ Even though the perks culture peaked before the turn of the century, many companies still offer enticements to investors, he added. The most recent example is Merlin Entertainments, which owns attractions across the UK including Madame Tussauds, Alton Towers, Thorpe Park and the London Eye. The company floated last week, and anyone buying more than 1,000 shares - which cost around 348p each – is entitled to a 30 per cent discount on up to two annual passes which give unlimited entry to the firm’s 31 UK attractions. But companies differ in how many shares are required to gain the extras. Groups such as M&S, Moss Bros and Legal & General say their discounts are open to all shareholders. Others require a minimum level of investment, and place conditions on the benefits. High street clothing giant Next requires investors to own 500 shares, which currently have an eye-watering total value of £27,475, to be able to claim its 25 per cent discount – and the offer lasts only between  April and the end of October,  so cannot be used in the Christmas rush. Larger size clothing retailer N Brown, which trades under brand names including Simply Be, High and Mighty and underwear label Figleaves, increases the discount shareholders can claim based on the number of shares they own. Other companies offer more unusual rewards. National Grid says its shareholders are entitled to go on a two-day annual visit each December to its sites around the country. Anyone holding more than 250 shares - worth around £2,400 - in pubs and brewing group Fuller, Smith & Turner can get a 10 per cent discount when booking to stay in any of its venues, with further offers on its food and drink. P&O owner Carnival offers credit that can be spent on board its cruises, but investors still have to pay full whack when booking their holiday. Others, such as chocolatier Thorntons or Frankie & Benny’s owner Restaurant Group, say they offer discounts periodically to investors. But the cost of offering such jaunts and freebies has led some firms to roll back the offers. British Airways used to give a discount of 10 per cent for shareholders of its parent company IAG - but the scheme is under review and the company last night couldn’t say whether it would continue. Mr Hunter warned that ‘perks are not a reason to buy shares’ and investment decisions should be based on key measures such as dividend and capital growth.","More than 40 companies on the London Stock Exchange offer perks .

Eleventh-hour: Ronald Phillips, 40, was due to be put to death on Thursday but was issued a stay of execution so he could give his liver to his mother . A death row inmate has had his  execution rescheduled so he can donate a kidney to his mother. Less than a day before child killer Ronald Phillips was set to die by lethal injection, the governor of Ohio called it off. Phillips, 40, who raped and killed a three-year-old girl, also wants to give his heart to his sister. ‘I realise this is a bit of uncharted territory for Ohio, but if another life can be saved by his willingness to donate his organs and tissues then we should allow for that to happen,’  governor John Kasich said. His sister, who has serious heart problems, might not be able to use the heart because it may be poisoned by the lethal chemicals. The execution will now take place on July 2, 2014. Critics have questioned whether the condemned can freely give consent, or are desperately hoping to win clemency. They worry such practices could make judges and juries more likely to hand out death sentences. And they are troubled by the notion of using inmates for spare parts. Medical ethicist Arthur Caplan of New York University said organ donation is incompatible with the goals of punishment. 'It's unethical because this guy who's being executed raped and killed a 3-year-old. When you donate your organs, there's a kind of redemption,' Caplan said. Postponed: Child killer Phillips will now be executed on a gurney similar to this next July . 'Punishment and organ donation don't go well together. I don't think the kinds of people we're executing we want to make in any way heroic.' Yet it's not unheard of for a death row inmate to become an organ donor. Condemned Delaware inmate Steven Shelton was allowed to donate a kidney to his mother in 1995, though his execution wasn't imminent. Controversial: Governor of Ohio John Kasich said the decision was 'uncharted territory' In 1996, the Alabama Supreme Court halted David Larry Nelson's execution so he could donate a kidney to his sick brother. His brother was too ill for surgery and later died. Requests in other states, including Texas, have been rejected. All involved so-called live donations, never donation of a vital organ like a heart. Richard Dieter, executive director of the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment, said the practice raises troubling concerns. 'Once you put the person into the death row or execution category, then their life becomes less in the equation of things,' he said. 'That's a slippery slope of one life being used to save another.' Anne Paschke, a spokeswoman for the United Network for Organ Sharing, said in a statement that her organization's ethics committee in 2007 deemed the practice 'morally reprehensible.' She said the committee sees extreme difficulty 'in ensuring that a condemned prisoner could give proper informed consent for donation, free from any coercion or consideration of personal gain.' Caplan said keeping vital organs viable during executions would require avoiding lethal injection, electrocution and other methods that would harm them. Utah murderer Gary Gilmore, executed by firing squad in 1977, agreed to donate his eyes, kidneys, liver and pituitary gland for medical use. His kidneys proved unusable because of bullet wounds. 'The only way I can think of to get organs out of prisoners is to shoot them in the head or guillotine them,' Caplan said. 'Are we really going to have witnessed executions of that type? I don't think so.' Dr. Brooks Edwards, the director of the Mayo Clinic Transplant Center and a transplant cardiologist, said it would be possible to use some organs after an execution, including the liver and kidney, but not the heart. Even so, he said he is opposed to the idea, saying it could lead a judge or jury to believe that handing down a death sentence could help save another's life. Precedent: In 1996, David Larry Nelson's (left) execution was halted so he could donate a kidney to his sick brother and Gary Gilmore, agreed to donate body parts for science before his execution in 1966 . 'One would worry that the enticement of organ donation could somehow be perceived, even subconsciously, as some kind of perverse incentive. I think that's wrong,' Edwards said. 'There are certainly accusations of prisoners being executed in other countries for organ donation, and we have to be well above that.' States such as California, Utah, Arizona, Oklahoma and Texas have nonetheless considered policies promoting organ donation among inmates. Some proposals would shorten sentences in exchange for organ or bone marrow donations. Some transplant recipients think such donations could be a good thing. 'I don't know who my donor is and I really don't care,"" said John Afek, a 57-year-old accountant and financial adviser who underwent a heart transplant nearly two years ago. 'It gave me my life back, and I'm a single dad with a couple kids who suddenly got their father back.'","Ronald Phillips, 40, was due to receive lethal injection on Thursday in Ohio .

An Alabama man will not go to prison despite being convicted of three counts of rape dating back to when his victim was only 14-years-old. Austin Clem, 25, raped the young girl three times between the ages of 14 and 18-years-old and will spend two years in a reform program and three years on probation instead of being locked up. Mr Clem will also have to register as a sex offender, but the slap on the wrist outraged many in the courtroom. ‘This isn't legal. It's not a legal sentence,’ Ms Andrews, now 20, told AL.com DA Jim Ayers jumped up in court and said. Mr Clem was convicted of one count of first-degree rape for the most recent incident two years ago, and two counts of second-degree rape for the two encounters when she was just 14-years-old. Sentencing guidelines provide for sentences anywhere from 10 to 99 years in prison, but Mr Clem will never see the inside of a cell. ‘My family was very relieved to hear the three guilty verdicts,’ Courtney’s father Richard Andrews told AL.com. ‘We were floored to hear the judge hand down such a light sentence.’ The convicted rapist will instead spend . two years in a reform program administered by the county jail, but . intended to keep non-violent offenders out of prison. Victim: Courtney Andrews has taken the unconventional step of publicly identifying herself and slamming her attacker's sentence . ‘Participation and successful completion in this program will offer offenders the opportunity, incentive and the means to correct behaviors and to appreciate consequences,’ according to the program’s website. Upon completion of the program, Mr Clem will spend three years on supervised probation. The married father must also register as a sex offender. Explaining that she was ‘livid,’ Ms Andrews recalled to the site ‘I thought, 'How is this even possible?’ Mr Clem’s attorney defended the sentencing in an interview with Mother Jones. Released back to his family: Mr Clem will be allowed to go back home to his family and will never see the inside of a prison cell . ‘It would seem to be relatively mild,’ Dan Totten told the site. ‘But [Clem's] lifestyle for the next six years is going to be very controlled.’ Some of the hardships Mr Clem will face include not being able to drink alcohol at parties or cross state lines to buy lottery tickets, the attorney explained. Ms Andrews, though, is concerned for the safety of both herself and her family, she told AL.com. ‘I moved to get as far away as possible from him,’ she said. Ms Andrews is currently enrolled at the University of South Alabama, according to her Facebook page. She also fears for the perverts young children. ‘The judge still chooses to send him home to his three little girls,’ said Ms Andrews. ‘I don't understand that. I can't fathom that.’ Mr Clem has also been ordered to stay away from his victim and her family, as well as pay just over $1,600 in restitution, according to sentencing documents reviewed by MailOnline.

Claims: Doctor Desai was called 'not one of us' by white colleagues at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough . A race row has erupted at a scandal-hit hospital where claims that up to 50 patients died as a result of alleged medical blunders were exposed by The Mail on Sunday last week. In an unprecedented move, 24 ethnic minority consultants from the hospital have written to the two main health watchdogs, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and Monitor, protesting about ‘bullying, harassment and racial discrimination’. They say the 140 consultants at Wexham Park Hospital, Slough – of whom about 90 are white – are split ‘on racial and ethnic lines’, suggesting that a disturbing type of medical apartheid exists. It comes as the CQC has said it is to investigate the alleged blunders at ‘high risk’ Wexham Park when it visits the hospital in the next few weeks. And it follows the revelation that a Tory MP, who is a doctor and whose constituency is served by the hospital, said he stopped his father having an operation there ‘to save his life’. The growing controversy over the hospital, which serves more than 440,000 people in the Thames Valley, follows this newspaper’s expose of  a secret report commissioned by  the hospital’s bosses into claims of medical blunders and feuding consultants dating back 14 years. Whistleblower Anil Desai, an Indian born consultant at Wexham Park, claimed up to 50 people may have died. His claims were dismissed by hospital bosses. But an official report by InPractice, a medical investigations firm, and leaked to this newspaper, supported him. The dispute escalated yesterday following the letter signed by 24 ethnic minority consultants at Wexham Park. In an incendiary claim, they say patients’ lives are being lost because serious errors by incompetent white doctors are covered up while ethnic minority doctors are victimised for minor mistakes on the operating table. Their letter states: ‘We are extremely concerned that patient safety is being compromised because of discriminatory treatment meted out to several ethnic minority consultants. This has included bullying and harassment, exclusion (suspension) as a first rather than a last resort, and other unfair treatment. ‘We fear the consultant body will soon be divided along racial and ethnic lines and indeed this may have happened already. We urge the CQC to investigate our concerns urgently in the interests of patient safety.’ 'We fear the consultant body will soon be divided along racial and ethnic lines and indeed this may have happened already' - Letter signed by 24 ethnic minority consultants . The signatories comprise leading consultants from several departments at the hospital. Most have Indian or Pakistani family roots, but a small number have Middle East  or East European backgrounds. The Mail on Sunday understands that seven ethnic minority consultants and doctors have been suspended in the past 18 months, while no white British consultants had been suspended. A source said: ‘The ethnic minority doctors feel they are hammered for trivial errors. They feel the mainly white medical hierarchy look after themselves like an old boys’ club and punish outsiders like naughty schoolboys.’ The Mail on Sunday revealed last week how, when Mr Desai first complained about blunders – a claim that was later upheld – an internal inquiry said his Indian background was ‘not initially a problem’. It added that colleagues of the (white) doctor that Desai complained about said ‘he is one of us, whereas Desai isn’t’. Fear: People avoid the hospital which has a poor reputation. Tory MP Phillip Lee said it is not fit for purpose . Wexham’s poor reputation was highlighted by Phillip Lee, Tory MP for nearby Bracknell, who is a doctor and still practises as a GP. Mr Lee’s father, Tony, 66, needed surgery and was due to be operated on at Wexham Park, but his son sent him to another hospital. MP Mr Lee said: ‘I decided he would get better care elsewhere. I did it to save his life. You can die on the operating table. Wexham Park is no longer fit for purpose.’ A CQC spokesman said: ‘Wexham will be inspected because it has been flagged as being potentially high risk. All information, including the InPractice report, will be considered.’ One of the consultants highlighted by The Mail on Sunday last week, Bob Soin, who, according to the InPractice report, had ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ outbursts, has been given two weeks paid time off by the hospital as a result of ‘stress’ caused by last week’s expose. It will cost taxpayers £10,000 to provide cover for him. Wexham Park is reportedly £80million in debt owing to mismanagement. Mr Soin declined to comment. A spokesman for Wexham Park was asked for a comment but failed to respond yesterday. The parents of a premature baby boy who died shortly after birth have won a six-year battle for compensation, after the hospital tried to ‘cover up’ its failings, writes Polly Dunbar. Daniel Diji died at Southend University Hospital in Essex 18 days after being born prematurely, at 27 weeks. His parents Paul and Melanie were told Daniel was profoundly brain damaged and that he died of ‘extreme prematurity’. But looking back after the initial shock of their son’s death in December 2007, they became suspicious they had not been told the truth, feeling staff had been ‘edgy and evasive’. In 2010, with the help of solicitors Simpson Millar, the family launched a legal bid for compensation. Tragic: Premature baby Daniel Diji died at Southend University Hospital 18 days after being born at 27 weeks . Now they have been awarded a five-figure sum in a Manchester court after a judge ruled hospital staff had failed to ventilate the baby properly. The pressure they used was too low, so Daniel’s lungs did not inflate properly. This meant he was starved of oxygen, causing severe brain damage and his eventual death, found Recorder Lawrence McDonald. 'We feel it was a cover-up. We think they knew from the start they had made a mistake. They've added insult to our injury' - Melanie Diji, mother of baby Daniel . The hospital had denied negligence. Lawyers for the NHS Litigation Authority argued Daniel had been born with dry lung syndrome, in which there is insufficient fluid for lungs to work properly. But the judge’s verdict was that ‘it was the failure to apply the proper pressures which caused Daniel’s death’, concluding ‘therefore, the breach of duty did cause Daniel’s death’. Mrs Diji said: ‘We feel it was a cover-up. We think they knew from the start they had made a mistake. 'By putting us through the ordeal of a court case instead of being honest, they’ve added insult to our injury.’ A Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: ‘We are extremely sorry the care Daniel received did not meet the standard we would expect and apologise unreservedly to Mrs and Mrs Diji for the loss they suffered following his death in 2007.’ Doctors at a hospital where staff fiddled cancer records told a pensioner he had the killer disease when what he really had was gallstones, writes Martyn Halle. Peter Sharp, 81, spent two years thinking he was close to death when he should have been enjoying retirement. He was ‘doped up to the eyeballs’ on morphine after being told by doctors at Colchester Hospital in Essex that he had cancer of the gallbladder and bile ducts. Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation . Trust has been placed in special measures after a Care Quality . Commission report found a number of cancer patients suffered 'undue . delays' At one stage, Mr Sharp was given six months to live – and counted down the weeks. The retired engineer kept on living, however, and was informed this August that there had been a mistake: his illness had been not tumours, but gallstones. Mr Sharp was fit and active until the misdiagnosis was made and he was put on morphine. He now has to use a mobility scooter to get around. 'Two years of morphine treatment for a cancer I never had has destroyed me. I felt like a zombie most of the time' - Peter Sharp, 81 . He said: ‘Two years of morphine treatment for a cancer I never had has destroyed me. I felt like a zombie most of the time. I can’t believe what’s happened. It’s an unimaginable situation.’ He intends to sue the hospital over the misdiagnosis. His solicitor, Julian Wilson of Thompson, Smith and Puxon, described it as ‘bizarre’ – but said he was investigating a similar case of a patient wrongly given chemotherapy. A spokesman for Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust said it had apologised to Mr Sharp for the distress and was investigating. Last week, the hospital was subjected to ‘special measures’ after inspectors found evidence staff had tried to hit targets by falsely recording how long cancer patients were waiting for treatment.","Feuding Wexham Hospital employees accused of racial and ethnic split .

Children's laureate Malorie Blackman has revealed she harboured anger towards white people for years after being sexually assaulted aged 13 . Malorie Blackman, the best-selling author and Children’s Laureate, was sexually assaulted in a cinema when she was just 13 years old, she has revealed. The writer, whose Noughts And Crosses novels explore racial tensions, said her ordeal at the hands of three white men meant she hated white people for much of her life as a teenager. Interviewed for today’s edition of Desert Island Discs, the 51-year-old author recalled: ‘I was 12 or 13 at the time. I used to go to the cinema a lot by myself and I was watching Disney’s Robin Hood. Three white guys came up behind me. ‘Two of them grabbed my arms so I couldn’t move and the other one sexually assaulted me.‘I was so traumatised. They were laughing and thought it was a big joke. I managed to get away and ran away in floods of tears.’ Blackman, who also wrote the acclaimed 1997 novel Pig Heart Boy, said the attack contributed to her being a very angry teenager. She described her attackers as ‘horrible’ and said that after the incident she felt ‘all white people were horrible’. Her love for a particular song eventually helped her break out of the cycle of hate.She said: ‘The thing that brought it home to me was a song I really loved called What You Won’t Do For Love, by Bobby Caldwell. ‘I went into a record shop and I found one of his albums and he was  a blonde guy. I remember thinking, ‘‘Oh my God, he’s white.’’ ‘And then I thought, ‘‘Are you really going to stop liking this song because this guy is white?’’ That’s when I caught myself and thought no, this is silly.’ Blackman, whose song choices on today’s programme include Bob Marley’s Redemption Song and Right Said Fred by Bernard Cribbins, also recalled how a racist careers teacher refused to write her a reference for university and blocked her dream of becoming an English teacher. Malorie Blackman, who tackles racism in her Noughts and Crosses series, also reveals a white careers teacher refused to write her a reference for university . Blackman said: ‘She just looked me in the eye and said, ‘‘Black people don’t become English teachers. Why don’t you be a secretary instead?’’ ‘For about three or four years I wasted my life hating her because  I thought she had ruined my life. If I met her again, I would thank her because she did me a favour. She taught me if that someone stands in the way of what you really want to do, you don’t stand there arguing with them and you certainly don’t let them stop you. What you do is find a way to go around them.’Desert Island Discs is on  BBC Radio 4 today at 11.15am.","Malorie Blackman was sexually assaulted by three white men in a cinema .

Getting involved: Wearing a yellow sweatshirt, khaki skirt and yellow necktie, an eight-year-old Kate Middleton in the Brownies . Prince Charles singled out for special praise his daughter-in-law’s work with the Scouts. The Duchess of Cambridge first became involved with the Scouting and Guiding movements when she enrolled in her local troop of Brownies in Bradfield Southend, Berkshire, at the age of eight. More than two decades later, she became a volunteer leader in the Scout Association. Writing in the MoS, the Prince says: ‘I need hardly say that I am particularly delighted that my daughter-in-law has helped to swell the ranks of much-needed Scout volunteers, since enrolling many more adults as  leaders is the greatest  need for so many of our youth organisations.’ When the Duchess joined the group in January 2012,  a spokesman for St James’s Palace explained that she ‘loved the idea of Scouting and working hands-on with children’, and felt that the organisation was well-suited to her own love of the outdoors. Her decision to join the Scouts, rather than the Guides, marked a change in times. Once only for males, the Scouts now boast 66,000 female members and in  2011 recruited more girls than boys. The Duchess’s involvement in the Scout Association has prompted a huge increase in the number of adults signing up to help, with more than 2,800 volunteering since she joined. Not content to be a figurehead, the Duchess has taken part in numerous Scouting activities. Joining in: The Duchess of Cambridge cooks with Scouts in the Lake District in March . In March, Kate, then five months . pregnant, met a troop in the Lake District for a day of outdoor . adventures, including baking bread on an open fire in the snow. Just a few weeks later, she took part in . a ceremony honouring the Scouts at Windsor Castle, where she was . praised as ‘an incredible role model’ by adventurer and Chief Scout Bear . Grylls. Prince Charles first experienced the satisfactions of volunteering during his schooldays at Gordonstoun. Charles – who loathed his time at the austere Scottish boarding school – found consolation in throwing himself into extra-curricular activities such as the Sea Cadets. He also became a volunteer coastguard when he joined the school’s surf-rescue unit. The Prince, who still speaks fondly of his time in the cadets, proved himself to be adept and determined, according to his biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby. In his second year at the school he was ‘skilled enough to paddle from Hopeman Beach to Findhorn Bay – 12 miles in a direct line but almost double the distance allowing for wind and tide’. It was during one of these adventurous outings that the most notorious incident of Charles’ schooldays took place. Quick Step: Prince Charles, centre behind a man in white uniform, on duty with the school's Sea Cadets . As a member of the four-man crew of the Pinta, one of the school’s ketches, the 14-year old prince sailed into Stornoway  harbour on the Isle of Lewis. During shore leave, he walked into a bar and ordered a ‘cherry brandy’. A journalist overheard him and the underage prince’s misdemeanour became global news. After the furore, the headmaster demoted Charles within  the cadets. The Prince was also the victim of bullying during his schooldays at Gordonstoun. And this may have shaped his campaign to stop teenagers drifting into street gangs. Charles endured beatings, extortion, rifling through his personal belongings and ostracisation.Jonathan Dimbleby wrote: ‘The Prince bore this thuggery with stoicism, apparently nurturing no enmity, though it reinforced his abhorrence of gangs.’","Duchess of Cambridge enrolled in her local Brownies in Bradfield Southend, Berkshire, when she was eight years old .

Taking his time: John Hurt as the weary doctor in The Day Of The Doctor, also starring Billie Piper . Hollywood star John Hurt has revealed that his role in the 50th anniversary episode of TV’s Doctor Who was one of the ‘toughest’ challenges of his career. The actor, who will play an earlier reincarnation of the Time Lord in The Day Of The Doctor – to be screened on BBC1 this week – said he had ‘given his life’ over to the part so he could get to grips with the script’s ‘quasi-scientific nonsense’. The 73-year-old star of the Alien, Elephant Man and the Harry Potter movies also dismissed a lot of modern television as ‘pap’ and said he was planning to cut back on his work commitments so he could spend more time indulging his passion for painting. Hurt, who will star with Matt Smith and David Tennant in the episode, said: ‘It was one of the toughest parts I have had to  learn, as difficult as anything I have done. ‘There is a lot of quasi-scientific nonsense which doesn’t stay in your head that easily and that meant entire weekends spent on solid learning. ‘I remember Matt said I’d have to give my life over to it because there is a lot of learning and very little time to shoot.’ Hurt’s unexpected debut as the War Doctor in the dying seconds of the last series caused a sensation when it was broadcast in May. Last week the BBC released an online mini-episode, which revealed that his character had regenerated from the eighth  Doctor, played by Paul McGann. Hurt last night remained tight- lipped about the episode but assured fans there was a lot  of interplay between the three Time Lords. He said: ‘You have three people playing one person. It’s the holy trinity. The War Doctor is not as quicksilver as the Matt and Davids of this world because he comes from a very different place. He is a little stiller and more reflective – a little more world-weary.’ Hurt said he didn’t think twice about signing up to the show. Scroll down for video . Phenomenal: He has been praised for his performance in the new episode with two other Time Lords . Alien: He even rates the TV role above his part in cult classic science fiction film Alien by Ridley Scott . ‘One of my agents didn’t reckon Doctor Who, but I said wait a minute, it sounds intriguing. It sounds like an event,’ he said. Hurt is still asked to sign autographs for his role in the 1979  science fiction film Alien and he expects to come under intense scrutiny from some of the more devoted Doctor Who fans. He said: ‘I’m very aware how important these things are to fans. For some people the show is their entire life.’ Less challenging? Hurt played severely deformed Joseph Merrick in the 1980 film The Elephant Man . Major roles: He landed a role in the Harry Potter franchise, playing Mr Ollivander, the wand merchant . Hurt said he was less enamoured with other TV shows and his first love remained independent cinema. ‘I know television is where a lot of people are running to. But I think it’s not rehearsed well enough and its not as complete as film,’ he said. Hurt added he had no plans to retire but would be cutting back on his workload. ‘I am not retiring but I’d like to slow down. I still want to do some painting,’ he said.","73-year-old 'gave his life' to part to understand 'quasi-scientific nonsense'

Frightened passengers on board a British Airways flight have told how they heard their pilot making a Mayday distress call 36,000ft above the Atlantic. The captain radioed for help when smoke filled the cockpit of the BA plane - and accidentally turned on the public address system. The Boeing 777 was flying from London Heathrow to New York but had to make an emergency landing at Ireland's Shannon Airport. Passengers on a British Airways flight heard a pilot make a Mayday distress call above the Atlantic (file picture) The BA flight took off at 1.05pm last Saturday with 220 people on board, the Sunday Express reported. But just before 2pm the crew spotted smoke filling the cabin. After putting on oxygen masks they immediately contacted air traffic control. They switched on the cabin address system, and the start of their Mayday call was heard by passengers. The flight had to land at Shannon Airport , with those on board told there had been an electrical fault. Passengers then had to wait seven hours for a replacement jet to JFK airport in New York. Some wrote about the incident on the The Aviation Herald website, which logs emergency landings. One user, Lester H, said: ‘I will not fly BA again. Ever.’ Passengers had to wait seven hours at Shannon Airport for another jet to JFK Airport in New York (file picture) Another, Rob Waite, said: ‘I was a passenger on board this flight with my new wife. ‘It was pretty frightening hearing the Mayday call, but [the] flight crew said the PA was accidentally turned on in the hubbub. The descent was controlled and landing heavy but again controlled. ‘Staff at Shannon couldn't have been more accommodating and we were offered free refreshments whilst there courtesy of BA.’ It is believed the smoke was caused by a fan in the cockpit which overheated. The jet has already been returned to service. A British Airways spokesman said: 'We flew engineers to Shannon who inspected the aircraft and it was brought back to Heathrow where it was fixed in the following days, and returned to service. 'We apologise to our customers who were diverted into Shannon. 'The diversion was precautionary and we sent a replacement aircraft out to collect customers and get them to their destination as quickly as possible. 'We understand any diversion is frustrating for our customers but we take safety very seriously and will always err on the side of caution.' Another Boeing 777 - on the same route - made an emergency landing at Shannon Airport on Thursday just an hour into crossing the Atlantic. Again the cause was a burning smell in the cabin - which is understood to have been caused by a faulty oven. Readers of The Aviation Herald warned electrical burning was what killed all 229 people on board a Swissair flight over the Atlantic in 1998. In that case, a fire is thought to have begun in the cockpit and spread to equipment before it could be brought under control.","Captain radioed for help when smoke filled cockpit on Boeing 777 .

Writing about the scientific device on Kickstarter, a site where creatives pledge for funds to launch their concepts, the team behind Smart Mug said: 'We have conducted extensive research and concluded that hot beverages such as tea, coffee, hot chocolate and others are frequently served at temperatures between 70⁰ C (158⁰ F) and 85⁰ C (185⁰ F). 'Brief exposures to liquids in these temperatures can cause scalds. 'We have thought about ways of measuring the temperature of the beverage consumed at home or office, without the need of any additional attributes. Eventually we came up with an idea of Smart Mug, powered by innovative elements and based on beautiful minimalist design.' There's never been a better time to put the kettle on. Careful! The mug has illustrations of a tea bag and coffee beans to indicate the average preferred temperature for each drink to help you avoid scalding your mouth .","Smart Mug determines the temperature .

Driver: Jack Hiscock, 24, above, admitted causing the death of his friend Jack Savage, 20, in a drink-fuelled car crash . A young driver who caused the death of his best friend in a drink-fuelled car crash has been jailed for 28 months. Tragic Jack Savage, 20, was a passenger in a Ford Fiesta driven by his friend, 24-year-old Jack Hiscock, in the early hours of May 11, this year. Hiscock, who had been drinking before getting behind the wheel, crashed the vehicle into an articulated lorry, leaving Mr Savage with fatal injuries. Police arrested Hiscock following the crash in Swindon, Wiltshire, and he later admitted causing death by careless driving while under the influence of alcohol. Mr Savage's family had pledged to stand by . Hiscock despite his actions - stating that their son would not have . wanted his best friend to suffer. However, he was sentenced to 28 months in prison by Judge Douglas Field, sitting at Swindon Crown Court, and banned from driving for three years. Speaking after the hearing, Police constable Lucy Fair of Wiltshire Police's Serious Collision Investigation Team, said: 'This is a tragic incident in which a young man lost his life. 'Jack Savage and Jack Hiscock were best friends and Hiscock will have to live knowing that his actions on that day in May resulted in the death of his friend. 'This case highlights the importance of driving with due care and attention at all times of the night and day. A driving error made in a split second can have fatal consequences. 'It also highlights the dangers of driving whilst under the influence of alcohol. Alcohol impairs judgment and awareness. 'Our thoughts remain with the family of Jack Savage at this difficult time.' Mr Savage's family previously said they were supporting Hiscock 'as one of our own', as their son would have wanted his friend to be treated with leniency. Scene: Jack Savage was a passenger in the Ford Fiesta when it crashed into an articulated lorry on the A419 at Commonhead, Swindon (file picture) His mother, Tanya, said that before his death, her son had known someone who was driving a car which crashed into a tree, and the passenger subsequently died. She said Mr Savage had felt sorry for the driver having to live with the guilt - a conversation the Savage family had in their minds after his death. 'We do not see the need for him to suffer more than he already is, and we know that our Jack would have wanted this,' she told the Swindon Advertiser. 'Everyone is supporting him and we stand by him as one of our own. So, we have put in a plea for leniency for when it comes to sentencing. 'He has got this to live with for the rest of his life, and that is a sentence that will never go away.' Mr Savage's father, Steve, told the BBC: 'Going to prison as he's expecting, whilst it serves a purpose to the public, it serves no purpose for him.'","Tragic Jack Savage, 20, was a passenger in car driven by Jack Hiscock .

Britain's top one per cent are now paying almost 30 per cent of all income tax - despite only earning 10 per cent of all income. Research shows the share paid by the highest earners, those who make £160,000 a year or more, jumped to almost a third from just 11 per cent when Margaret Thatcher came to power. It comes a month after government figures last confirmed the rise, crediting the coalition's policies for lower and middle income earners. Paying their share: How the share of tax paid by super-earners has risen (source: HM Revenue and Customs) The rise since 1979 was revealed in research by the accountancy firm BDO UK for the Sunday Times. The top one per cent of earners in 1979 paid just 11 per cent of the nation's income tax - despite the highest rate of income tax being set at 83 per cent. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured today on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, wants to raise the income tax threshold further to £10,500 . What they pay in proportion to everyone else has risen sharply since then, the paper reported, to a new high of 29.8 per cent this year. That is despite the super-earners, who number about 300,000 people, accounting for a far smaller 10 per cent of all Britain's income, according to the left-wing think tank The Resolution Foundation. When it comes to their assets, however, the super-rich are far better off - with the richest 10 per cent owning 44 per cent of the nation's wealth, or at least £437,000 each. The figures come after Chancellor George Osborne argued those with ‘broadest shoulders must take the biggest burden’. Low earners have seen their income tax bills cut, with the amount people can earn without getting taxed rising steadily to £10,000. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg wants to raise that further to £10,500. But the top one per cent of earners, who paid 20.8 per cent of all income tax just ten years ago, have seen the proportion they give to the taxman rise. It will be welcome news to the coalition, which faced attacks after lowering the top rate of tax from 50 per cent to 45 per cent. Labour said it was a tax cut for the rich - but Conservatives insisted it would stop the super-wealthy moving their income out of the country altogether. Jim O'Neill, former chief economist at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, told the Sunday Times: 'I don't have a problem with the fact that those of us who earn more pay so much more tax. I'm not one of those people who complain that the rich are paying too much. 'But I do think there needs to be much greater awareness of the fact that the same people politicians like to bash to win votes are contributing an awful lot to Britain's public services.'","Huge increase since 1979 revealed in research for the Sunday Times .

Outspoken historian David Starkey has sparked outrage by saying Princess Anne looks like a horse after she suggested eating horse meat could be a good thing. He went on to compare her idea to Jonathan Swift's iconic satirical essay A Modest Proposal, which said economically-troubled Irish people should sell their children as food for rich people. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions panel show, he said: 'I never thought of Princess Anne who is much given to riding around on horses - looks rather like one generally - as a satirist. 'I had never thought of her as reading Swift, for example, on what you do with the problem of Ireland,' he added, referring to the satirical piece. Mocking: David Starkey (right) was blasted by listeners for saying Princess Anne (left) looks like a horse . He went on to mock the princess, a former eventing champion, saying: 'It is exactly the same point, as mad, as brilliant, as circular – presumably it comes from having that coronet so firmly thrust into your elaborately quaffed and lacquered hair. 'Brilliant, it's a brilliant idea… perfect.' The academic has previously been accused of racism after describing Scotland, Wales and Ireland as ‘feeble little countries’ on the BBC1 panel programme, and blaming ‘black culture’ for the riots that swept the country. In 2011 he was attacked for calling a child 'fat' on Jamie Oliver's show Dream School. He has also branded the Queen a philistine who lacks an education, and told a Question Time audience we should not free oppressed countries - and shouldn't have helped to free the French. Listeners rushed to lambast the author for his comments. Welfare: Former eventing champion Princess Anne said selling horse meat could be an incentive for good welfare . One person wrote on Twitter: 'What right does Starkey have to insult Princess Anne with personal remarks on her looks?' Another tweeted: 'BBC just re-broadcast David Starkey's misogyny re. Princess Anne & a horse #bbcaq Plain wrong.' Others attacked the BBC for not condemning Starkey's comments. One said: 'Disgraceful that David Starkey's ref to Princess Anne resembling a horse went uncontested by the Chair - patriarchal sexism in action.' His comments follow a speech the princess made at an animal welfare conference, claiming horse owners might take better care of them if they believed they could later sell them for meat. She was addressing warnings of a horse welfare crisis, as 7,000 horses are currently at risk of abandonment and neglect. Speaking at the World Horse Welfare charity conference in London, Anne said: 'Our attitudes to the horse meat trade and the value of horse meat may have to change.'","Academic mocked princess's appearance on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions .

Plans: Labour MP Thomas Docherty has put forward proposals to give troops the same protection as ethnic minorities . Assaults on Armed Forces personnel would become a specific crime entailing tougher penalties for offenders, under a new law to be voted on by MPs this week. Verbal or physical attacks on members of the Army, Air Force or Navy would be categorised as hate crimes under an amendment to the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The proposal by Labour MP Thomas Docherty would give troops the  protection currently afforded to ethnic minorities, gay people and the disabled. An attack on a member of the Armed Forces or their family would be classed as an aggravated crime if  a court establishes that it was motivated by the victim’s association with the military. The move is backed by Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker and many Conservatives. The Ministry of Defence, however, said last night that Service chiefs did not want members of the Armed Forces to be singled out for special treatment. One in five troops has been verbally abused while in uniform, and one in 20 has been physically abused, according to a survey commissioned last year by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft. More than 9,000 Service personnel were quizzed as part of the research. Mr Docherty told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The evidence shows that our soldiers, sailors and airmen need the protection of the law as they are often singled out for attacks on the basis of their service to their country. ‘For this reason, the increase in sentences for aggravation related to disability, race or sexual orientation should be extended to include members of the Armed Forces and their families. The law would apply whether or not the personnel were in uniform at the time. Protection: Concern for the safety of soldiers has risen since the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby . ‘I have received a lot of support from Conservative MPs, so I am optimistic that the amendment will get the necessary backing in the Commons.’ Concern for the safety of soldiers has risen since the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby outside Woolwich Barracks in London earlier this year. Last night, Colonel Richard Kemp, a former British Army commander in Afghanistan, said: ‘It is shameful that members of the Armed Forces need specific legal protection, but that is the reality of a society in which we live. There have been too many cases in recent years where soldiers have been subjected to torrents of abuse, often by those who object to Britain’s use of military force overseas.’","Proposals would see soldiers get the same protection as ethnic minorities .

Wine makers thinking outside the box are selling their whites and reds in aluminum cans. While grape aficionados are likely to struggle with the 'beerification of wine', producers say the accessible packaging will attract new consumers. Wine not? Oregon-based Union Wine Company is selling wine in an aluminum to save 40 per cent on its packaging costs . Ryan Harms founded Union Wine Company in 2005 . Oregon’s Union Wine Company has put Pinot Noir and a Pinot Gris in an eight-ounce can, just like Pabst, Budweiser, or Miller Light. Owner Ryan Harms told Fast Company the decision will save the company about 40 percent on its packaging costs compared to bottles. But he said the main reason for the innovation was to rebrand the wine drinking experience. 'We wanted to come up with a product that embodied our company’s philosophy of making great craft wine minus all the fuss,' he said. 'There is a ‘winification' of beer trend going on and Union Wine Co. is at the forefront of a new trend, the ‘beerification’ of wine'. 'We want to be a part of those everyday . celebrations. That is a big part of our idea of ‘bringing . Oregon to your table,’ thus these wines are more about immediacy, and . the can is certainly an extension of that thinking.' The cans will be released next year for about $5 each. Classy: Australians Steve Barics and Greg Stokes invented Barokes Canned Wine after 'a narrowly-avoided shattered-glass-meets-jacuzzi episode' While the concept is relatively in the U.S., Australian producers Steve Barics and Greg Stokes  began selling their wine in cans three years ago. 'After a narrowly-avoided . shattered-glass-meets-jacuzzi episode', the men decided ready-to-drink recyclable cabs was the way of the future. The Barokes cans, featuring a patented design with a ceramic lining that prevents the wine from making contact with the aluminum, holds the equivalent of two wine glasses, according to L.A. Weekly. And last year, The Sparkling Collection, sold in cans under the Hardys, Banrock Station and Stone’s brands. 'We are passionate about innovation, and with the launch of these new cans from some of our most recognisable brands, we are spearheading the creation of a new category which will open wine up to new consumers, with new occasions,' Clare Griffiths, European marketing director for Accolade Wines, told The Drinks Business.","Wine producers are selling booze in cans to save on packaging costs and appeal to more consumers .

Philip Hammond is facing a revolt among his MPs over plans to replace full-time troops with reservists . Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is this week facing a revolt among his own MPs over controversial plans to replace full-time troops with Army reservists. Rebel Conservative backbenchers are plotting to line up with MPs from Labour and other parties to block plans for a dramatic expansion of the UK’s reserve forces. The move, led by Basildon Tory MP John Baron, could potentially threaten a Coalition scheme to remove 20,000 full-time personnel and beef up what used to be called the Territorial Army. But there are already fears that the plan is running into trouble, with new figures showing that the newly-named ‘Army Reserve’ is shrinking rather than growing to a planned size of 30,000 within five years. Led by Mr Baron, the 17-strong group of rebel Tories will this week try to force the Defence Secretary to order a study into the ‘viability and cost-effectiveness’ of the scheme. The rebels, who also include former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis, will seek the backing of Labour MPs and those from smaller parties in an attempt to inflict a humiliating Commons defeat on Mr Hammond. Mr Baron said last night: ‘There is growing concern in Parliament about the rising costs and badly missed recruitment targets of the Government’s Army Reserve plans. MPs of all parties want to scrutinise their viability and cost-effectiveness.’ Another rebel Tory said: ‘We can’t use a Commons vote to tell the Ministry of Defence what size the Army should be but we can raise questions about the replacement reservist plan – questions that they have to answer.’ Last night, the Ministry of Defence responded by insisting that the service reforms were on track. A spokesman said: ‘The reforms to the Army were announced over a year ago and are well under way. ‘We are two months into a five-year recruitment campaign that will see the Army Reserve increasing from 19,000 to 30,000 by 2018 with improved training and equipment. ‘Over 25,000 reservists have served on the front line in Iraq and Afghanistan. We intend to make increased use of them in future, in line with the way most of our allies operate.’ Rebel Conservative backbenchers are plotting to line up with MPs from Labour and other parties to block plans for a dramatic expansion of the UK's reserve forces . Labour has so far declined to say how it will vote but sources close to Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker said they were ‘strongly inclined’ to back the Tory rebels. Mr Hammond’s allies hit back  last night, warning Labour against ‘playing politics’ with the future of  the Army. One said: ‘It would be a shame if Labour did this as they have previously agreed to the need to reshape the Army with an increase in the reserves and a reduction in the regulars. After years of neglect under Labour, the reserves are being rebuilt, fully funded and equipped properly.’","Rebel backbenchers are plotting to line up with MPs from Labour and other parties to block Defence Secretary Philip Hammond's plans .

A Hasidic Jew who was fired from the NYPD for refusing to shave his beard could win the right to rejoin the force. Fishel Litzman, 39, was just a month away from graduating from the police academy when he was fired last June. The police department has a rule that beards may not exceed more than 1 millimeter in length. Litzman, who keeps a beard for religious purposes, objected to shaving and is fighting the NYPD in court to get his job back. On Friday, Federal Judge Harold Baer said that his termination made him a victim of religious discrimination. The ruling may allow Litzman to pursue the career of his dreams. 'I want people to know that you can follow your dreams and never have to compromise your religion. That's what makes this country so great,' Litzman told the Daily News. According to CNN, Litzman was in the top 1 per cent of his classes at the police academy and was well liked by fellow classmates. He's a Kipa! Litzman was in the top 1 per cent of his class at the police academy, was highly regarded by peers, and believes there is no reason the NYPD shouldn't keep him . He also told the police academy of his religious needs before he was even a student. 'Since I had applied for an exemption before I was accepted and had already been photographed, I believed that the NYPD was aware of my religious needs and accepted me knowing I needed to keep my beard intact,' Litzman wrote. The NYPD claims that officers must shave their beards so that they can properly wear a gas mask in the case of a terrorist attack. Litzman's lawyer, Nathan Lewin, is arguing that the police department made and 'after the fact rationalization' for why he had to shave his beard. He blames their decision on blatant discrimination. Even though the judge acknowledged that it would be problematic if all cops could not properly wear a gas mask, he also said that the NYPD couldn't claim the '1 millimeter' standard as an official rule. The NYPD also doesn't enforce the beard rule for undercover cops, who still may have to wear a gas mask in the case of an attack. Hair rule? The NYPD claims that police officers must be clean shaven in the chance that they must wear a gas mask . CNN reports that when Litzman was a student at the academy he was told, 'Cut your beard, after the academy you'll never have to.' People at the academy also told him, 'it's an unenforced rule.' 'One of the points that has been drilled home during my short time at the academy is the need to represent the NYPD with integrity,' Litzman wrote to police following his termination in 2012 . 'Although not knowing whether I will be punished for maintaining my religious beliefs has been very taxing on me and my family, I will not waver in my firm belief that I can be a successful member of the NYPD and an Orthodox (Hasidic) Jew at the same time,' he continued. Attorney Nathan Lewin is no stranger to hairy situations and has won many cases for Hasids who've fought to keep their beards in the Army and in the Air Force. 'We hope this is the beginning of the end of the NYPDs refusal to grant full religious accommodations to applicants who may not, for religious reasons, trim their beards,' said Lewin to the Daily News. Lewin also said that they will ask for Litzman to be reinstated. 'The primary objective was always to get back into the academy and do what I always dreamed of,' said Litzman. Litzman has been working as a paramedic since being fired but hopes to be in uniform again.","Fishel Litzman, 39, was a Hasid fired from the NYPD because he refused to shave his beard for religious purposes .
