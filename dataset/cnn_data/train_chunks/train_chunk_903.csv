Homes destroyed by wildfires in Pateros, Washington: The biggest wildfire in the state's history remains at 52 percent contained on Thursday but the weather forecast calls for hot and dry conditions to return over the next few days . The Carlton Complex of fires now stands at more than 250,000 acres, or nearly 400 square miles, and it's being fought by about 2,500 people. Remains of buildings burned by wildfires lies across the road from the Alta Lake Golf Course near Pateros, Wash. Thunderstorms on Wednesday dumped hail and heavy rain on the region and helped firefighters battling the blaze . The storm raised humidity in the area of the fire and prevented it from growing much, fire spokeswoman Kris Erikson said. Officials were concerned that lightning could spark new fires in the parched region, and that the precipitation could lead to flash floods because so much ground vegetation has been lost. Due to the intense thunderstorm activity, all firefighters in the Carlton Zone (north) were pulled off the line for safety reasons. In the end, the change in weather conditions helped dramatically raise the percent of the fire contained from 16 to 52 percent. It now stands at more than 250,000 acres, or nearly 400 square miles, and it's being fought by about 2,500 people.

The Carlton Complex of fires has burned nearly 400 square miles in the north-central part of the state and destroyed 150 homes . Unfortunately the weather forecast calls for hot and dry conditions to return over the next few days. Speaking at a fundraiser Tuesday in Seattle, President Barack Obama said the wildfire, along with other western blazes, can be attributed to climate change. ‘A lot of it has to do with drought, a lot of it has to do with changing precipitation patterns, and a lot of that has to do with climate change,’ the president said. Obama signed an emergency declaration on Wednesday because of wildfires burning the past two weeks in the state. The declaration authorizes the Federal . Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security to . coordinate disaster relief and help state and local agencies with . equipment and resources. At more than 250,000 acres, the Carlton Complex is larger than the 1902 Yacolt Burn, which consumed 238,920 acres in southwestern Washington and was the state's largest recorded forest fire, according to HistoryLink.org, an online resource of Washington state history.

Koczewski's wife to express his condolences. More . than 2,100 firefighters and support crew are involved with fighting the . fire, Payne said. She said firefighters have had success with fire . lines on the east side of state Highway 153 between Carlton and Twisp. Karina Shagren, spokeswoman for the state's Military Department, said the National Guard has already been offering aerial support, but 100 National Guard troops were now being used on the ground for firefighting, and additional troops were receiving firefighting training for potential future use. Inslee briefed Obama on the fire situation after the president arrived in Seattle on Tuesday afternoon at the start of a three-day West Coast trip. 'We have real significant challenges,' Inslee said. 'To have the president here today is actually a stroke of luck.'

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . Three Albuquerque teenagers accused of fatally beating two homeless men beyond recognition have been ordered held on $5 million bonds. Police say they are also investigating claims by one of the teens that the trio had been terrorizing transients around Albuquerque, New Mexico, for months. Prosecutors requested $1 million bond for each of the three during initial appearances on Monday, but Metropolitan Court Judge Linda Rogers set bond at $5 million. She cited the gravity of the alleged crimes and the suspects' potential to flee. Scroll down for video . Alex Rios,18, makes an appearance on video for an arraignment in court on Monday for participating in the beating of two homeless men in Albuquerque, New Mexico over the weekend . Police expect that brothers Nathaniel Carrillo, 16, and Gilbert Tafoya, 15, will be charged with murder as adults  after confessing to the brutal slayings . Alex Rios, 18, Nathaniel Carrillo, 16 and Gilbert Tafoya, 15, have been charged with open counts of murder and are being held in Bernalillo County detention facilities. Rios has been charged with two counts each of murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree felony and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He also faces three counts of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and one count each of tampering with evidence and robbery. Carrillo and Tafoya will likely be charged with murder as adults, Drobik said. ‘I personally, after reading that complaint, was sick to my stomach because of the nature of the violence and the age of the offenders,’ Drobik said. Bedding, clothing and broken glass litter the homeless encampment in Albuquerque where the three teenagers are accused of fatally beating two homeless men to death . Alex Rios, 18, has been charged with two counts each of murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree felony and contributing to the delinquency of a minor . Officers responded Saturday around 8 a.m. to a 911 call reporting two bodies in a field. They found one victim lying on a mattress and another lying on the ground. Jerome Eskeets, a third victim who said he was able to flee, was hospitalized for his injuries. Eskeets told police that he recognized one of the ‘kids’ hitting and kicking him as someone who lived in a house nearby. Police went to the home and found the three suspects, according to the complaint. The homeowner identified Tafoya and Carrillo as his sons and Rios as a friend who had spent the night. Investigators say in the complaint that blood on the waist band of Tafoya’s shorts triggered further investigating and interviews with all three. Rios told investigators he acted as a . lookout while the other boys attacked both men with bricks, sticks and a . metal fence pole. He said the victims were struck all over, including . in the face and chest. The . younger suspects, however, told police that Rios also took part in the . attacks. Both boys said they wanted to look for someone to beat up and . possibly rob. Both describe how all three covered their faces with black T-shirts before walking over to the victims, who were lying down. Then the trio allegedly used various objects to attack the men, including cinder blocks. According to Tafoya, they all took turns picking up cinder blocks over their heads and smashing them into the men's faces more than 10 times. The suspects said after the attack, they took one victim's driver's license and debit card. The license was found in the teens' home, police said. Crime scene: Albuquerque police work at the scene where three teenagers allegedly killing the two sleeping men in an open field in an attack so violent it left the victims unrecognizable, said police . According to Tafoya, all three have previously attacked homeless people around Albuquerque. The teens claim to have assaulted as many as 50 vagrants, reports NBC News. Police are now going to look into open cases involving attacks on transients to see if they are related, Drobik said. Meanwhile, investigators have not yet officially confirmed the identities of the two victims. Their transient background and the severity of their injuries have made identifying them somewhat difficult, Drobik said. The department is asking anyone in the homeless community with information to get in touch with them. Drobik said any transients uncomfortable approaching police can also contact them through any social service agency. ‘Just please come forward,’ Drobik said. Family and attorneys for the three declined comment after the court proceeding.","Alex Rios, 18, Nathaniel Carrillo, 16 and Gilbert Tafoya, 15, have been charged with open counts of murder .

"By . David Mccormack . and Joel Christie . The missing pregnant wife of a . California-based Marine who vanished last month had suffered a . miscarriage just a few months ago, a close friend has revealed. Erin Corwin was last seen on June 28 when she told her husband she was going on a hike in Joshua Tree National Park. When she didn't return home, husband Jonathan called police the next day. Court documents say that on the day . Corwin, 20, disappeared she had planned to meet with Christopher Brandon . Lee, a married neighbor that she was believed to be having an affair . with. Still missing: Erin Corwin, 20, disappeared on June 28, two weeks after discovering she was pregnant. Married to a Marine, she was allegedly having an affair with a fellow marine who lived on the same military base in Twentynine Palms, California . The lovers apparently planned to spend the day together enjoying a . hunting trip. Detective's affidavit shows the investigation is focusing on married . father-of-one Lee, 24, who may have been the father of Corwin's unborn child. Now a long-term friend of Corwin, Brooke Phillips, has revealed that her friend had suffered a miscarriage not long ago, although she wasn't exactly sure when. ‘She . was really sad about it. She wanted kids. She loves kids and she . thought she was really positive about it, like “Sure, the time will come . when I have kids,”’ Phillips told ABC News. The detective's affidavit also states that Lee's wife, Nichole Lee, had told a friend police 'would never find the body' and that she scolded her husband for 'not being able to keep his lies . straight when he was interviewed by detectives because he was dumb'. Arrested but released: Christopher Brandon Lee, 24, a recently discharged marine, was allegedly having an affair with Erin Corwin. He was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of having a 'destructive device' but released two days later. He has reportedly moved to Alaska . Newlyweds: Erin married Marine Cpl. Jonathan Corwin (pictured) two years ago, and they found out Erin was pregnant two weeks before she went missing . Base: The couple live at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms. Christopher Lee also lived at the base. Erin's abandoned car was found outside the site two days after she was reported missing . Lee, who volunteered at a horse ranch . with Corwin, was arrested July 4 on suspicion of possession of a . destructive device. The device turned out to be a potato gun, but Lee was held for two days before being released on bail. Authorities wouldn't say if the two cases are connected. Lee maintains he was not with Corwin on the day she went missing, but confirmed he was hunting in Joshua Tree National Park. He also told police that he had kissed Corwin, but denied having a sexual relationship with her, according to the documents. Corwin was last seen on June 28 bound for Joshua Tree National Park while three months pregnant. Her husband, Marine Cpl. Jonathan Corwin, reported her missing the following day. Two days later, her car was found outside . the gate of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine . Palms, where the couple and Lee live. Court documents show that Corwin had admitted to a friend she was having an affair with Lee in a series of text messages. Corwin said in the texts she had planned an outing with Lee for the day she disappeared. Lee was arrested earlier this month after a search warrant was served at a home in Yucco Valley. He was then released on bail two days later, the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department said in a statement. Wife: Nichole Lee (pictured), who is married to Christopher Lee, allegedly told a friend that police would 'never find' Corwin's body . Moved: Following his arrest earlier this month, Christopher Lee, 24, reportedly moved to Alaska . Family: Christopher and Nichole Lee have a daughter together . Ranch: Both Corwin and Lee kept horses at the White Rock Horse Rescue Ranch in Yucca Valley . Mystery: Erin Corwin was on her way to . Joshua Tree National Park (pictured) - about five miles from the Marine Corps base - . when she went missing three weeks ago . A day after that, he was honorably discharged after six years in the Marine Corps, the Desert Sun reported. While interviewing Isabella Megli, the owner of White Rock Horse Rescue Ranch, where Corwin and Lee keep horses, authorities learned that Lee's wife had made several comments to her about the investigation. 'Nichole told Isabella that without a body the detectives did not have a case against them and the detectives would never find the body,' the court document's said. Nichole also said investigators had searched her residence but 'missed something' because they didn't go through the garage. However Megli told The Desert Sun that her and Nichole were talking about something else. Megli owns the Yucco Valley home that the police searched. Lee, his wife and their daughter stayed at the home as they prepared to relocate to Alaska. They are believed to have moved last week. The affidavit says a rifle belonging to Lee was retrieved by police from a closet in the back of Megli's residence. Megli said she had no knowledge of the rifle. She added that she never suspected Corwin and Lee of having an affair. The court documents also say police found a single . set of shoe tracks at Corwin's abandoned vehicle at the marine base. The tracks led from . the driver side door of her Toyota and then disappeared next to a set of . tire tracks. The court document states that tracks found at the scene were 'consistent' with the tire tracks left by Lee's Jeep. Sweethearts: The married couple moved in . together for the first time only a few months ago after the husband . returned for serving overses. They have been together since they were teenagers (pictures) Sheriff's spokeswoman Jodi Miller said Lee was arrested as a result of a search warrant in an ongoing investigation, but would not give more details, nor say any more about the destructive device Lee is suspected of possessing. It was not immediately clear whether Lee had hired an attorney, and current contact information in his name could not be found. He was in the Marines for seven years, last serving as a rifleman in the Individual Ready Reserve. A number of people have been interviewed in Corwin's case, Miller said, but no person of interest or suspect has been named. Several law enforcement agencies and hundreds of volunteers searched a broad swath of desert for Corwin, but there have been no reported sightings. The search was significantly scaled back last week, but it continues, officials said. Corwin is still classified as a missing person. Police do not believe she ran away. Both Erin and Jonathan Corwin are from Oak Ridge, Tennessee. They have been together since they were teenagers.","Newly pregnant Erin Corwin, 20, was last seen leaving her home at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat .

The man behind the new book is Leslie Klinger. In 2011 he published a similar volume of re-imagined stories, A Study In Sherlock, and paid a $5,000 licensing fee even though he didn’t believe that he needed to. For his latest volume, In The Company Of Sherlock Holmes, Klinger doesn’t believe he should pay and last month a federal appeals court in Chicago ruled in his favor, sparking the latest court action. ‘When a story falls into the public domain, story elements - including characters covered by the expired copyright - become fair game for follow-on authors,’ wrote Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Lucy Liu portrays Doctor Joan Watson opposite Jonny Lee Miller as consulting detective Sherlock Holmes in CBS' modern-day version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous characters, right. The author's books were first published in the U.S. between 1887 and 1927 . Klinger argues that the essential characteristics of Holmes and Watson were established in the works already in the public domain. Therefore, he says, he and his team are free to write new works based on them. But Doyle's estate insists that the characters continued to develop throughout the course of all the Holmes works and are seeking further copyright protection, reports NBC News. 'Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson were not static but are dynamic literary characters who changed and developed throughout the Sherlock Holmes canon,' Doyle's heirs are arguing before the U.S. high court. 'Many aspects of these characters' natures are not revealed until the final 10 stories, which are still under copyright protection,' says the estate. It has asked the high court to delay enforcement of the appeals court ruling, at least temporarily, until its legal team could prepare a more detailed petition for the Supreme Court to hear their case. Leslie Klinger, left, doesn’t believe he should pay the Doyle estate to publish his latest book, right, and last month a federal appeals court in Chicago ruled in his favor, sparking the latest court action . Doyle's estate want to petition for the Supreme Court to hear their case . Klinger has dismissed the appeal to the Supreme Court. 'The 7th Circuit [federal appeals court] ruled on June 22 in our favor, finding that creators were free to use the characters of Holmes, Watson, etc., so long as the creators did not infringe on the ""protected elements"" in the remaining 10 copyrighted stories,' he wrote on his blog. 'Clearly, the characters' names and most of their characteristics are not such ""protected elements."" Thus, to put it very loosely, Sherlock Holmes is ""free.'"" His book is scheduled to be published in November.","Heirs of the literary rights to Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson have filed an appeal with the Supreme Court to stop publication of a book of new stories .

"By . Bianca London . Made In Chelsea was back with a bang on Sunday night as TV's favourite toffs landed in New York for a stateside spin-off. Familiar faces such as loveable pug Spencer Matthews and pint-sized Louise Thompson returned to our screens - but there were also some newcomers to the show, including Binky's big sister Anna-Louise Felstead, who joins the West London set as they spend the summer in New York. Anna-Louise, 35, is the eldest of three Felstead siblings and could potentially serve as a shoulder to cry on as Binky's turbulent love life with Alex Mytton unfolds. Big Binky! Anna-Louise Felstead joined the Made In Chelsea cast as they starred in the debut New York spin-off show so FEMAIL caught up with her to find out what it's like to be Binky's big sister . As avid Made In Chelsea fans will be well aware, Alex repeatedly messed with Binky's emotions in the last season of the posh reality TV show but as Sunday's show revealed, Binky has finally seen sense and cut ties with the love rat. Speaking to MailOnline, New-York based artist Anna-Louise said: 'It was a given that I’d be there to support Binky following the break-up. Usually she has mum, her dog Scrumble and her friends in London so I was there to offer a strong family support network.' 'The whole family were pulling their hair out when she continued to date Alex,' revealed Anna-Louise. 'We're just all so relieved she's finally seen sense. She wasn't acting herself at all, she was blinded by him and was clinging onto that earlier feeling of being in a loving secure relationship. 'She is worth so much more than that so yes, we're all very relieved it's over.' Family first: Binky, Jane and Anna-Louise are extremely close and Anna-Louise said the whole family were so relived when Binky and Alex finally called it quits . Another cast member who shares Anna-Louise's train of thought is Cheska Hull, who Anna-Louise describes as 'properly supportive' and a 'wonderful' friend to Binky. Opening up about growing up with Binky (who got her nickname 'because she's the youngest - small and dinky - which ended up as Binky somehow), Anna-Louise said: 'We are very close, although not very similar. She's more like my brother (i.e. naughty!). I'm more arty. 'Early memories of Binks were me dressing her up and photographing her for my Foundation art projects. When she was very young, she was often pottering around the garden wearing nothing but bright Wellington boots bottle feeding our baby goats. 'She was also riding my old pony Megan in a basket saddle before she could even walk.' Arty: Anna-Louise started working as a reportage artist and illustrator, painting and drawing on location at events like London Fashion Week and The Cartier Polo World Cup on Snow in St Moritz, and now she's a full-time artist based in New York . Need for speed: Anna-Louise is selling off her racy illustrations of motorsport events on Easyart and Binky says she is sure the collection is going to be a 'huge success' While Binky followed the reality TV path, her sister pursued her passion for art and is fast becoming renowned in the creative world. Anna-Louise started working as a reportage artist and illustrator, painting and drawing on location at events like London Fashion Week and The Cartier Polo World Cup on Snow in St Moritz, as well as illustrating articles for magazines and newspapers such as The Independent, Guardian and Spears WMS. 'I started filling up my father's work diary a from a very early age - he would bring large empty calendars back from the office,' she said of her earliest art memories. 'I was constantly drawing and painting and when I was very young started painting our pet chickens to sell to my parents' friends. At Saint Martins I contacted the Royal Navy and asked to paint on board ships. I spent two weeks on HMS CORNWALL documenting life at sea.' It's over: Binky and Alex Mytton, pictured in happier times enjoying some cocktails on the beach during a romantic holiday together, have finally called it a day - and the Felstead family couldn't be happier . Avid art fan: The 35-year-old said she started filling up her father's work diary a from a very early age - he would bring large empty paged calendars back from the office - and now she's made a career out of it . Talent: Binky's sister is selling her works of art, which feature popular Chelsea haunts, on Easyart . Anna-Louise has been full-time self-employed artist since 2005 and has given Easyart the exclusive licence to print her eye-catching artworks that depict some of Chelsea’s most famed hotspots, often frequented by the Made in Chelsea cast, as well as her illustrations of motorsport events. Speaking about her sister's talent, Binky  said: 'I’m really thrilled that my sister is working with Easyart. She is such an amazingly talented artist and I’m sure the collection is going to be a huge success.' Glamorous: While Anna-Louise pursued her love of painting, Binky has become one of Britain's best-known reality TV stars - but she's still a country girl at heart and spends a lot of time back in the 'Shire with her family .","Anna-Louise, 35, joins cast in New York this season .

"By . David Mccormack . Rookie NFL quarterback Johnny Manziel, who’s been enjoying a summer of non-stop partying since signing with the Cleveland Browns in May, looks to have found himself a girlfriend who is more than up to the challenge of matching his hard partying ways. Colleen Crowley, an undergrad at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas, has been spotted regularly with Manziel since the pair attended a Drake concert together last month. Earlier this month, the former Heisman Trophy winner and the Houston socialite were also spotted together at a Boston Red Sox game at Fenway Park together.

Now it looks like things could be getting pretty serious if the lovebirds respective Instagram accounts are anything to go by. In the last day or so, both Manziel and Crowley have shared intimate photos of them kissing and hugging each other. The pair appear to have much in common, including that they are both Texans.

"By . Bianca London . It's high summer and for those going on a beach break, it's time to unveil our bodies in the blinding sunshine. We've all got our insecurities: most of us have wobbly bits we'd like to change and pore over images of celebrity bodies, wishing we had the Duchess of Cambridge's slim legs or Lucy Meck's rock-hard abs. To this end, a new study polled both men and women on what parts would make up their ideal beach body if they could choose from any British celebrity. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likes of David Beckham and the Duchess of Cambridge featured along with popular sports personalities and reality TV stars. Scroll down for video . Is this the perfect human? A new study quizzed men and women on which celebrities had the best body parts and they created the 'perfect' celebrity beach body based on the results . For men, sports and movie stars were the popular choices, with Harry Styles' hair, David Beckham's face and Tom Hardy's beard forming the top half. Geordie Shore's Scott Timlin's torso, footballer Jack Wilshere's arms and Frank Lampard's legs make up the rest of the perfect celebrity man. Myleene Klass' face shape, Holly Willoughby's hair,  Keira Knightley's eyes and brows, and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's smile and dimples combine to form the 'perfect' celebrity female face. The perfect combo? Myleene Klass' face shape, Holly Willoughby's hair, Keira Knightley's eyes and brows, and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's smile and dimples made up the perfect celebrity face .

Lucy Mecklenburgh's stomach, Kelly Brook's boobs, the Duchess of Cambridge's legs and Jessica Ennis' arms made up the perfect female physique. As ever, the sum looks a lot less appealing than the parts. Kelly Brook's breasts and Kate's coltish legs look rather unlikely - and top-heavy - when spliced together. Keira Knightley's dark doe eyes and Holly Willoughby's tumbling flaxen mane don't quite gel either. The men fare slightly better, with the finished result slightly resembling Bradley Cooper. A spokesperson for My Voucher Codes, who created the images, said: 'It’s interesting to see what each sex would choose for their ideal beach body.

"By . Bianca London . Trainers have been the . footwear staple this season; they were on countless catwalks at fashion week and every celebrity owns a pair of designer kicks. Sick of the trend? Sorry folks, it's here to stay for another season so grab yourself some sneakers. And no, we don't mean a subtle pair of black on black New Balance, this season the humble trainer has undergone a total re-brand and for AW14 it's souped up, wedged and, as Vogue says, practically on steroids. Once . the reserve of the super fit, the traditional . running shoe has been given some serious style credentials in its new funky form. Step to it: This season, the trainer trend takes a psychedelic twist and the louder and brighter, the better. This Giuseppe Zanotti design, left, will, however, set you back £1,025 and Chanel's offering, right, costs a cool £700 . It all started at Chanel, where Karl Lagerfeld sent Cara Delevingne and co down the catwalk in colourful tweed trainers and the fash pack followed suit. Since then Katie . Grand, editor of LOVE magazine, has collaborated with trainer makers . Hogan to create wild looking designs combining neon colours and animal . print, while Stella McCartney’s designs for trainer giant Adidas have . been a huge hit. Long-time fan: Model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne is rarely . seen off duty without a pair of pimped up trainers on, like the . Alejandro Ingelmo Silver Trons (right) Delhi-born designer Ashish designed stand-out LED Buffalo Boots for Topshop.The light-up wedge trainers have already been spotted on Lily Allen, . Lady Gaga, Ellie Goulding and Rita Ora - however, at £350, they don't . come cheap. So high into the stratosphere of the . fashion gods has the blinged up, custom trainer risen, that Selfridges has devoted its entire shoe department (the largest in the . world) to sneakers. A massive central display is devoted to a single designer, alternating regularly to show all the seasons trainer trends. Helen . Attwood, shoe buying manager for Selfridges, says: 'It's a revolution. Out of all our footwear categories we are repeating orders mostly on . flats and trainers. They are selling out across every price point.' ‘From high street and sports labels to high fashion, it really is the most fun and democratic show trend we’ve seen in ages.’ Famous fans: Justin Bieber and Rita Ora love their souped up trainer styles and it seems they both have a pair for every day of the week . First look: The wacky shoes were unveiled at Ashish's AW14 runway show and they're coming to a store near you next week . Of course she's got some! Savvy dresser Lily Allen has already got her hands on the coveted trainers . And it seems the designers themselves also agree. Rebecca . Farrar-Hockley, creative director at Kurt Geiger, said: 'There's . definitely a radical shift towards lower heels. Sneakers are really on . trend. 'Girls are getting used to being able to run about and I don't think they are going back to the big high heels.' Celebrities . can't get enough of running shoes off duty, and the latest versions loved by . include creations designs in rare animal skins, bespoke pairs and . serious designer label bling. But how do you pull them off this season? Vogue's Jessica Bumpus mused: 'Wear them with your skate gear, wear them with your ballgown, this is footwear with cross-occasion appeal. 'Step out in glitter-bright or colour-blocked versions, or those with jewelled flower details - there's something out there to satisfy even the most reluctant of trainer-wearers.' Pricy: Isabel Marant is currently the queen of . sneakers, with one extremely long waiting list for her wedged trainer, . which comes in a variety of funky designs and costs several hundred pounds . DIY: The Nike Blazer (£85) can be customised on nike.com with a choice of colours , patterns and material for every part of the sneaker . Get creative: The classic Nike Air max 1 is as popular now as . it ever has been, but now comes in a kaleidoscopic range of designs and . colours (£150, nike.com) Trainers are also known as as kicks, trabs daps, sandshoes, gym boots or joggers, gutties, or canvers, according to Wikipedia. The . first athletic shoes, with a canvas upper and rubber sole, were . developed as beachwear in the 1830s by the Liverpool Rubber Company. They were  known then as plimsolls or pumps. By . the early 1900s, sneakers were being produced by small rubber companies . who specialized in the production of bicycle tyres. U.S. Rubber, . introduced Keds in 1916, about the same time that Converse was marketing . its All Star. At first, the . market for sneakers was small and practically invisible, but after the . First World War, the US turned to sports and athletes as a way to . demonstrate moral fibre and patriotism. A . huge breakthrough came in when the Olympics were revived after the . Second World War, attracting more fans not only to sports, but to . sneakers as well. The . 1950s gave American families more leisure time, and as the baby boom . started, more families chose to dress their youth in sneakers as school . dress codes relaxed. In . the early 1960s, sneakers were imported to the US from Japan, but . accounted for only a small portion of the market until Nike founders . Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman began importing Onitsuka Tiger shoes . (1950s) under the name Blue Ribbon Sports. By . the 1970s and 80s there were shoes for football, jogging, basketball, . running - every sport had its own shoe and trainers had graduated to the . movies. Dustin Hoffman wore them while playing reporter Carl Bernstein in the . movie All the President's Men while Cybill Shepherd even wore a pair of . comfortable orange sneakers with her elegant black gown at the 1985 Emmy . Awards. Woody Allen wore them to the ballet and Led Zeppelin had them on in their 1976 documentary. Companies . like Nike and Adidas cashed in on the craze with major endorsements to . players - the largest  to Chicago basketball player Michael Jordan, who . was given  a contract with Nike to make his own signature line of shoes . and apparel.","Trainers go colourful, wedged and crazy for AW14 .

"By . Bianca London . As the inimitable Duckface in Four Weddings And A ­Funeral, she was . memorably dumped at the altar by Hugh Grant. 'When I die my obituary will probably be . ""Duckface dies"",' admits the actress in a short film she's made with M&S in which she models one of its latest collections. However, her new role in season five of Downton Abbey might soon shake up the public's perception. We shall have to wait until September to find out if Lady Anstruther captures our imaginations in the same way as her breakthrough role in Four Weddings. Clearly keen to tap into her very British appeal, M&S has snapped the actress in the quintessential seaside town, Hastings, for its Style & Living section. Scroll down for video . Actress turned fashionista: Anna Chancellor, who shot to fame as Duckface in Four Weddings, is modelling M&S' latest range. Top, from £6.99, Jacket, £49.50 . Anna, . 49, is the perfect poster girl for M&S' range of cosy knits, polka-dot blouses and tailored blazers. Clearly throwing herself into her latest venture, the actress can be seen frolicking on a British beach and even jumps into the sea in the new imagery. Down-to-earth she might be, but Anna comes from illustrious stock: she's the granddaughter of the 4th Baron Hylton, her uncle is one-time Spectator editor Andrew Chancellor and her . ­sister ­Katherine was formerly ­married to acerbic writer Wilf Self. Speaking about her well-connected family, she said: 'I am related to a prime minister, Herbert Asquith and Jane Austen was my great aunt, though going back eight generations. My parents came from quite an aristocratic background. But how that has affected me? It’s difficult to say. 'You are what you are aren’t you? Genetically I suppose it has given me certain qualities but then it’s difficult to know which qualities came from whom, because of course by this stage it’s just stories - they weren’t anybody I actually knew. 'Jane Austen, I’m obviously very proud to be related to her. She was a famously good aunt, didn’t have any children herself but was very keen on her nephews and nieces so if I’m feeling a bit stressed or feeling that things aren’t going very well, I’m like ""Are you looking out for me, I hope you are looking out for me."" Autumn style: Anna, 49, is the perfect poster girl for the range of cosy knits, polka-dot blouses and linen blazers . Anna, who stays in shape by swimming, can be seen splashing around in the sea in the new imagery . 'Otherwise, maybe I was a bit rebellious about my background. Maybe I’ve embraced it on some levels - and probably a lot my acting skills and my ability with language is inherited. 'My father is very articulate and funny and probably would have made a good actor – there are quite a few hidden theatrical people in my family who weren’t actually actors but probably would have been quite good!' Speaking about her family - her parents divorced and married other partners, so she has step-siblings - she said: 'It was chaotic, we were outdoors a lot and rode a lot - very privileged but I think it was difficult at times because we were quite wild, that’s for sure. We were quite crazy. Anna went to a convent school and says she was one of those people who found learning 'very difficult.' 'I think I had learning difficulties actually, in fact, a lot of actors do find that they’re not that academic or intellectual. I often play parts where you would have had to have a very good education, a lawyer, doctor things like that - but I never could have been that in my own life. I could hardly get an o level. I was basically thick,' she said. Colourful history: Speaking about her family she said: 'It was chaotic. We were quite crazy' Jumper, £39.50 . She adds that she was 'incredibly lucky' to have found acting; otherwise she could have felt that she was an underachiever. 'I feel I should be able to tell people . that it is possible, to earn a living doing something you love - it’s a . great privilege and if you have that you should be very grateful.' Reminiscing on starting out as an actress at the age of 18, she explains how she 'fell into' becoming a naked artist’s model to earn a bit of money. 'I wasn’t physically shy,' she said. 'I’d turn up and they’d say ""will you take your clothes off"" and I’d think it was fine. I guess coming from the country side I was never self-conscious. So that was how I earned a living when I should have been at school!'. Anna had a baby, Poppy,  who was the somewhat unexpected result of a . romance the actress had at drama school with cult poet Jock Scott at the age of 21. She admits that everything looked like it was going to go 'tits up' and 'disastrously wrong' at the time. Beach babe: Anna worked as a naked artist's model when she was younger as a way to make money when she first moved to London . She said: 'I think one of the hardest things about . having a child is who is going to look after them when you’re working. And I was lucky because my mum would take her. But when you’re acting . you get up very early, you could leave for work at 5am and if you’re a . single mum, which I was at times, not always, you would have to think . who would take Poppy and maybe drop her off somewhere the night before. 'So it wasn’t easy for Poppy or me, she didn’t have know . that mum would pick her up all time - but I was very lucky because I was . very unsuccessful and very unemployed, so actually, I was around a lot!' Working mother: Anna, who had a baby when she was 21, said one of the hardest things about having a child is who is going to look after them when you're working - she was lucky to have her own mother on hand to help. Skirt £22.50 . Anna, who describes her personal style as 'scruffy', can't speak highly enough about her best friend and daughter Poppy. She said: . 'I feel that it was one of life’s incredible coincidences that I . happened to have a child that I love. Of course I love my child, but we . just really click. 'I always . found her so funny, witty, even when she was young she would say things . and I’d think that’s actually really funny - you’re a genuine wit. She’s . a wonderful person and we have so much in common. 'So of course you can . love your child very much but find you don’t have anything in common - . for either of you, but we can go to galleries and do things together - . go for walks, we love animals - we’ve got a lot in common and that’s . just a coincidence I think.' She also says she has been 'incredibly lucky' to have shared 16 years of her life with her husband, Algerian-born former minicab driver Redha Debbah, who is seven years her junior. 'I was mad about him,' she reminisces. 'It’s very sweet actually, very . romantic and we’ve been together a long time. We love each other. 'We lead quite separate lives, he’s busy and I’m busy - we come and go. Despite her enduring success, Anna is modest and doesn't believe that she has all the qualities of a leading lady. 'They always seem to think I’m more the dominatrix, the stalker, the nutter or the evil,' she said. Fit and fabulous: Revealing her secrets to looking good, Anna says she tries to swim every day as she's so bored of the gym. Blouse, £29.50 . 'I was always a character actress, I suppose. I think it’s a bit more fun – although sometimes it’s quite narrow the view that they see the heroine as.' Her most defining role has to be alongside Hugh Grant in Four Weddings, of which she laughs: 'When . I was in four weddings I didn’t realise that Duckface was my name - I . thought it was Henrietta so it took me ages to accept that Duckface was . my actual, official name. When I die my obituary will probably be . ""Duckface dies"". 'What can I say about that – do I mind? No.' Revealing her secrets to looking good at almost fifty, Anna says she tries to swim every day and that she's so bored of the gym. 'I hate being told I have to do 50 of this and 20 of that, by then I’m literally praying. I become a Catholic and revert to my roots, praying to the Virgin Mary for it to end. I can’t take any more of it. I just can’t do exercise in that form, but swimming is different. 'And when I come out I can’t be bothered to get dressed so I put on my dressing gown and get in my car, or sometimes I walk back home in my towelling dressing gown and I think everyone will see Duckface and think I’m a nutter,' she said.

"By . Bianca London . She will star in the new gymnastic reality show Tumble in just under two weeks and it seems that all those cartwheels have been paying off because Lucy Mecklenburgh looks incredibly toned in her new beauty campaign. Lucy is the new ambassador for Sunkissed - a tanning and bronzing cosmetics brand - and as a fake tan devotee, she is the perfect fit. The reality TV star, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, shows off her honed physique and golden glow as she poses in a series of images for the brand. Sharing her first ever fake tanning experience, Lucy said: 'I was about 12 or 13 when I first . started using fake tan. It was me and Sam Faiers after school and it was . really hard back then to get a good tan for a reasonable price so . we got these cheap wipes. Scroll down for video . Glow getter: Lucy Mecklenburgh, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, has been unveiled as the new face of Sunkissed and has shared her beauty secrets . 'We looked really streaky and we . absolutely stank. I've definitely learned over the years that it's . trial and error with fake tan.' Lucy, who always has a flawless glow and never looks less than immaculate, maintains that it only takes her fifteen minutes to get ready in the morning. She said: 'It literally takes me about 15 minutes . to get ready. I put a little bit of bronzer on, some . mascara or a pink lipstick to finish the look.' Bronzed babe: Lucy, 22, said that her signature look is some bronzer swept across her face and a slick of coral lipstick to complete the look . Natural beauty: Lucy, who always looks immaculate, maintains that it only takes her fifteen minutes to get ready in the morning . Body coincidence: Lucy said that while she was never particularly sporty at school, she developed a love of fitness later on in life and it's helped boost her self-confidence . The 22-year-old says that the best piece of beauty advice she's . ever been given was by her grandmother who told her to always wear a strong factor SPF. She cites her biggest beauty splurge as her tattooed semi-permanent . brows. 'It's just so much easier in the morning not having to pencil them . on every day. It's made my life a lot easier,' she said. While many women aspire to look just like Lucy, who regularly tops best beauty and body polls, the former TOWIE star looks up to someone else. 'My beauty icon is Jessica Alba. She's always got a lovely natural, healthy glow and she always dresses amazingly,' she said. Best investment: The fitness guru said that having her eyebrows tattooed on makes her beauty regime so much easier in the morning .

'Exercise definitely helps with your confidence and builds your self esteem,' she said. 'That's why I set up Results With Lucy, to help other girls feel the way I did. Toning up fills you with confidence, it makes you feel better in yourself.' And judging by her new campaign imagery, which sees her oozing confidence, her newfound love of fitness has paid off.

'I realised early on that nothing lasts . forever, especially as a model - you have to build something for . yourself from it. Looks go and you fade. Modelling is short lived,' she said. 'I . wanted something for when I want to take a back seat. There'll be a . brand that I'll be sitting at the helm of and enjoying. This is really . the start of something I see as a long-term thing.'

"By . Bianca London . She launched an extraordinary attack on the fashion world and hit out at fashion bible Vogue after the American edition claimed she fell asleep during an interview, but Cara Delevingne may well be regretting her tirade now. The 21-year-old has been revealed as British Vogue's new cover girl and graces the September issue - the glossy magazine's most prestigious edition. Writing about the upcoming issue on its website, Vogue says: 'The biggest that we have ever published - and with more fashion shoots than ever before - the September issue brings all of the autumn/winter 2014 collections to the fore for the first time, making us almost wish for the first leaf to fall (or at least start to prepare sartorially for when it does). Scroll down for video . Look who it is! Cara Delevingne has been revealed as British Vogue's new cover girl and graces the September issue - the glossy magazine's most prestigious edition . 'Inside, Delevingne is photographed by Mario Testino, making the most of her gamine frame and Sixties ingénue looks to showcase the coming season's most desirable pieces.' Described by the magazine as 'fashion's most talked about girl', this is the third time in 18 months that Cara has fronted the magazine. Clearly shot before Cara . described the fashion industry as 'not the most understanding or . compassionate of industries', the young supermodel looks flawless posing . in a 60s inspired outfit on the cover of the 462-page issue wearing . new-season Louis Vuitton. A few weeks ago, Cara lashed out at the fashion world in a well-documented Twitter tirade. It all stemmed from a piece that American Vogue's Plum Sykes wrote that claimed that the party-loving model was late for their meeting. She also said that the 21-year-old requested a massage prior to their interview and fell asleep, causing the meeting to be cut short. Hitting back: American Vogue has claimed that Cara Delevingne fell asleep during an interview and the model has hit back on Twitter branding the fashion bible 'liars' Sykes explains that Cara was in pain from too much kickboxing and wanted the pair to enjoy a massage before the interview so that they could both be 'relaxed.' Sykes was left waiting half an hour after the massage ended, only to be informed that Cara had fallen asleep. In her article about the episode, Sykes writes: 'Cara finally appears, looking refreshed after her rest. “I’m so sorry!!!” she exclaims, collapsing into a chair. “I fall asleep everywhere! Someone recently asked if they could publish a book of pictures of me sleeping, because there are so many.” Cara’s personal assistant then informed Sykes that Cara wasn't hanging around or going to Hackney City Farm with her as they had planned and was instead off to do some film recording, followed by hair and make-up, a fitting for her Met ball outfit with Stella McCartney, a Fendi-store launch party, all rounded off by dinner with Karl Lagerfeld. Sykes goes on to explain that she then called photographer Tim Walker, who has worked with Cara many times, only to be told by him that on every shoot he's done with her, Cara's fallen asleep (even snoozing for seven whole hours on a Mulberry shoot.) Speaking out: Cara took to Twitter to explain to her 1.7m followers that the fashion industry 'is not the most understanding or compassionate' of industries . Sykes discovers that Cara had been out partying with Lily Allen the night before their meeting and later calls Cara to ask about her love of a good night out and her resulting reputation. 'Well, the going out is more to do with the fact that I am literally jet-lagged all the time,' Cara told Sykes. 'I can’t sleep in the evenings.

Cover girl: While Cara has featured on the glossy cover of British Vogue, Cara doesn't appear to be too happy with the American version after the article they wrote about her . She took to Twitter and wrote: 'Why do people in the industry lie so much???? They would rather see you fail than succeed. What happened to supporting each other? It’s even worse when your [sic] trying to fight people that have all the power because then you are powerless. 'All I can say is I work extremely hard and ‘sleeping’ is proof that sometimes I work too hard. I apologise for being so ambitious. This just shows that the fashion industry is not the most understanding or compassionate of industries.

Motivational message: Cara shared an inspirational quote on her Instagram page after her Twitter rant about the offending article . In little more than . two years, Cara has reached . supermodel status, . but in a . recent interview she seemed a tad downbeat about her chosen industry. While she acknowledges her ‘luck’ at having achieved so much in such a short space of time, she told Alexis Petridis of The Guardian that young girls should be aspiring for careers that are more intellectually demanding. When asked what she’d do if her daughter . wanted to become a model, she replied: ‘I’d say no, if that’s all she . aspired to. You know, I get a lot of girls who say, I just want to be a . model so badly. And I think: You can do better than that. ‘I mean, look, I do love it, I’m not saying anything bad about it, I just think you can do a lot more.’ She . adds: ‘I was incredibly lucky to do as well as I’ve done, it’s not . easy, there’s so many models go through so much s**t, and it’s just, if . you have a brain, which everyone does, use it and try and do something . else.’ Success: Cara Delevingne's fortunes have changed . drastically over the last two years. From comparatively humble . beginnings as a fashion intern at Asos, she is now one of the world's . most successful, and sought after young models . Cara’s ascent began in the offices of . fashion website Asos in 2012, where she was ‘discovered’ by Burberry’s . Christopher Bailey while working as an intern. ‘As . a model, I really stand for not being a model, if that makes sense,’ she said.  ‘When I started, the whole idea of the model was very . different, it was a bit stuck-up. Not stuck-up, but no one was trying to . have fun, or not even have fun, but be willing to smile.’ That . smile, allied with a series of comedic expressions, has become . something of a trademark - and a magnet for the cameras that follow her . every move. What's . more, the star admits she would love to quit modelling herself one day . and go away and make a music album for six months. She said: 'That's what I'd f**king love to do. And when this shit doesn't work out, yeah, I will block that out and do it.'","Cara is September issue cover girl - after lashing out at fashion industry .

"By . Bianca London . It's the hairstyle that was once reserved for punks and male models but with a little help from the glossiest and most fashion-forward A-listers, the undercut is fast becoming the hairstyle du jour. Cara Delevingne and Miley Cyrus, who are known for their experimental styles, were the first celebrities to rock the shaved hairstyle and now even play-it-safe Jessica Alba and Jennifer Aniston are showcasing what at last looks like newly-shorn hair. Last week's Comic-Con International, a comic convention held annually in San Diego, was case in point. Co-stars Jessica Alba and Rosario Dawson wore matchy-matchy undercuts for the Sin City panel and Natalie Dormer loved the look so much, she wore it for three days in a row. Scroll down for video . Trialling the trend: Actresses Jessica Alba (L) and Rosario Dawson were both seen with urban undercuts - the hottest new hairstyle to sweep the beauty world . There are several takes on the new style but whether you literally shave one side of your head like Rosario or create an illusion of the look with a cornrow a la Jessica, you'll be bang on trend this season and next. The likes of Khloe Kardashian and Kendall Jenner have embraced a more pared-back and elegant take on the style and the usually grungy  Kristin Stewart even wore the look in her Chanel campaign. But this . isn't the first time we've seen the look. In fact, it's a catwalk style . that was trialled at Fashion Week in February that has since filtered . down to the red-carpet slowly but surely ever since. The rebellious style, which is expected . to play an even bigger part in London Fashion Week in September, was spotted at shows by . Alexander McQueen, Simone Rocha and Marchesa; the Vogue beauty team have even featured a how-to in their latest issue. She just can't get enough! Game Of Thrones star Natalie Dormer seemingly loves the new style - she's been seen sporting it at every event this fortnight . Long-standing fan: Trendy Cara Delevingne, who loves to experiment with her style, was seen wearing cornrows at last year's MET ball, left, as well as at the Elle Style Awards this year, right . Fake it: If you don't want to literally shave your hair off on one side, create the illusion by braiding it into cornrows a la Kendall Jenner, left, and Khloe Kardashian . But how do you take a tricky catwalk trend and pull the look off at home? Steve Carr, Senior Stylist at Jo Hansford, said: 'When . deciding between the undercut or the faux undercut, you need to consider . your lifestyle and if it’s something you need to hide for work. If so, . the faux option is the best choice. 'You can . only hide a real undercut if you have long thick hair. If you have a low . parting, opt for that side. If you have a centre parting, you can use . whichever side you feel most comfortable with. 'If you . are going to be bold and pick the real option, you have to go really, . really short - you definitely don’t want to have any fuzz! You need to . have it re-shaved regularly. Your stylist will be able to help you with . placement as the distance that you go back will depend on your crown. 'If . plaiting instead, decide on the number of plaits you need. They need to look . neat to get the best results so you may need to ask a friend or . professional for help. If you are doing yourself - you will get the . tidiest results with an inverted French plait. Famous fans: Ellie Goulding rocks an undercut on her album cover, left, while Kesha trials the trend with cornrows . 'Start by using a hair oil to tame any flyaways - Jo Hansford Illuminoil is perfect for this. Undercuts work best on short, messy looks - for example Miley Cyrus, or long textured styles like Alice Dellal. 'It doesn’t work so well on mid-length or fine hair, and you need to style the hair that you leave loose with texture or movement.' Cornrows date back to the Stone Age and were used to portray status, age, religion and ethnicity. Fast . forward to the Sixties and plaits were used as a political statement . with many African Americans embracing their cultural roots, and now, it seems, they're a serious style statement. According to style and brand expert Nick Ede, the cornrow is here to stay - and it's all Cara Delevingne's fault. He said: . 'Cornrows are a big trend right now that’s polarising the fashion elite! The Cara Effect will encourage festival goers and Ibiza trendies to . embrace the trend in different ways but it will be particularly . interesting to see how it trickles down to the high street. 'I think . we’ll see people trying both loose and tight styles, what will make this . interesting will be seeing if they can rock it like Cara.'

"By . Bianca London . A mother-of-two, who wanted to prove that women in the army could be just as feminine as their fellow females, has been crowned a beauty queen. Georgia Delaney, 23, from Calne, Wiltshire, joined the army four years ago on the advice of her mother after getting into the wrong crowd at college and 'messing up her education'. During her time as a Junior Combat Human Resources Specialist, Georgia, who always wanted to be a model, started looking into beauty pageants - and she's already won one. Beauty queen: Georgia Delaney, 23, started looking into beauty pageants during her time in the army and entered her first one in February last year - now she's taken part in three pageants and has won one . Stay-at-home mother Georgia, who has taken part in three pageants, said: 'I wanted to be a model but my mum suggested the army so I just went along with it. 'The training was extremely difficult and there were times when I just wanted to give it up, but I found something in myself and carried on. 'Women in the military aren’t seen as feminine so I decided to do pageants to prove people wrong. 'After leaving the army last year due to injury I am now looking to do more pageants to spread the word that you can be a mother and do beauty pageants.' Winning: The mother-of-two, who was in the army for four years but had to leave due to injury, is now a beauty queen and encouraging other women to follow her lead . Dream come true: Speaking about her newfound hobby, Georgia said: 'I wanted to be a model but my mum suggested the army so I just went along with it. Women in the military aren't seen as feminine so I decided to do pageants to prove people wrong' Georgia first joined the army in 2010 after she ‘messed up her education’ and despite wanting to be a model, she joined the military on the advice of her mother. After battling through the training Georgia qualified as Pte Delaney, Junior Combat Human Resources Specialist. She said: 'It was a lot easier once I got through the training. I was discharged in 2013 due to a non-freezing cold injury, which made my fingers go numb and meant I couldn’t even hold a rifle. 'Now I stay at home with my two boys, Oscar, eight months, and Henry, two, as well as doing some promo work.' Working mother: Georgia, pictured with her son, has now co-organised the Miss Swindon and Wiltshire heat and will compete in the Miss South West Great Britain finals next month . New life: After leaving the army, left, last year due to injury, Georgia is now looking to do more pageants to spread the word that you can be a mother and do beauty pageants . The official Miss England competition does not allow women to enter if they either have children or are married, so mother-of-two Georgia was relieved to find there were other pageant competitions out there. She said: 'I started pageants while I was in the army. I wanted to prove that just because I was in the military it didn’t make me masculine, and that having children didn’t change who I was as a person. 'My best friend, Hannah Goulding, was promoting pageants which inspired me to get involved. The first pageant I entered I won, which spurred me on to keep going. The second one was national and I came 15th out of 60.' Georgia has now co-organised the Miss Swindon and Wiltshire heat and will compete in the Miss South West Great Britain finals next month. In the army: Georgia joined the army after falling into the wrong crowd at college. During her time as a Junior Combat Human Resources Specialist, pictured, she started looking into beauty pageants and has taken part in three . She said: 'I have met so many people through the pageants. You are in competition with the other girls but it’s like competing against your friends. 'There’s a view that you have to be pretty but there is another side involved. It’s not just what you wear and how you look. 'My partner Michael doesn’t like the pageants - he doesn’t see the point.

"By . Julian Robinson . The mother of a four-year-old killed in a fire was ‘screaming for her little boy’ as her house went up in flames, according to a neighbour. A 10-year-old boy was rescued in the house fire near Bradford, West Yorkshire yesterday and is recovering in hospital, but his younger brother could not be saved. Police have now named the victim as Nathan Harrison. Neighbour Julie Mitchell, 35, has today told of the moment the boy’s mother raised the alarm. Scene: Nathan Harrison, died in hospital after inhaling fumes from the fire which began in the bedroom of his West Yorkshire family home . A ten-year-old boy is recovering in hospital after neighbours spotted smoke pouring from the back bedroom window of the house in Keighley, West Yorkshire . The elder boy is understood to have suffered smoke inhalation after Monday's fire inside the house, pictured . ‘She came round calling for help. She was screaming for her little boy,’ said Ms Mitchell. ‘The fire brigade turned up and ambulance took him away on a stretcher. ‘I can’t get it out of my head. I just keep seeing his little boy coming out of the house. ‘It’s so sad, he was the same age as my little girl. ‘He and his brother were just cheeky little blond haired boys. They would play football together in the garden. ‘I didn’t know them as they had only been here for a couple of months, but my heart goes out to them. It must be so painful for the whole family.’ The . two boys had been brought out of the house by the time police arrived . and both were taken to hospital with serious injuries from smoke . inhalation, West Yorkshire Police said. Emergency services were called to a . house in Keighley, near Bradford, just after 2pm yesterday after smoke . was seen coming from a rear bedroom at the property in Sunnyhill Grove. A woman, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘There was flashing lights everywhere. ‘There were three fire engines, two ambulances and a first responder. ‘We could see smoke coming out of the upstairs window, but then we saw this little boy coming out on a stretcher. Police investigating the fire have described it as 'a tragic incident' and said a full investigation will be carried out . ‘It was such a sad sight to see. No parent should have to go through that. ‘We didn’t know the family but we would see the boys playing outside together, with not a care in the world. ‘It must have been terrible for him, but I hope he is now at peace.’ A police officer remains on guard outside the detached property where the fire broke out. The cause of the fire, which was confined to the bedroom, is being investigated. The fire service confirmed that the property was fitted with two smoke alarms, but it is still being investigated as to whether they were operational at the time the fire broke out. Dave Walton, Assistant Chief Fire Officer for West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue, said: ‘On attending we found two boys, aged ten and four, being brought out of the house. Both were taken to hospital with smoke inhalation. ‘The ten-year-old is now recovering from his injuries which are not life-threatening. Sadly, the four-year-old died in hospital. ‘The cause of the fire which was contained to the back bedroom, remains under investigation. Initial enquiries are underway with the colleagues form the police, and are at a very early stage. ‘Clearly this has been a tragic incident in which a young child has lost his life and a full investigation will be carried out.’","Police have named four-year-old who died in house fire as Nathan Harrison .

"By . Rebecca Brett For Mailonline . A private document, revealing Gatwick's plans to campaign against expansion at Heathrow airport, embarrassingly backfired after papers outlining the strategy were reportedly left on a train. Secret plans from Gatwick Airport were revealed to lobby 'gold, silver and bronze' opinion formers against the expansion of the rival airport's third runway. Gatwick proposed to target influential people such as politicians, civil servants, business leaders and environmentalists in order to gain influence on the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies. Gatwick had planned to campaign against Heathrow's expansion by targeting influential people . The document, seen by The Sunday Times, revealed the operation being fought by Britain's second-biggest airport as it tries to convince the government-appointed commission that it should be allowed to expand. In addition to persuading the opinion formers to speak in favour of a second runway at Gatwick, the strategy also aims to 'neutralise the prevailing default bias that we perceive exists in favour of Heathrow.' Further reading revealed Gatwick's bosses also instigated a noise study which undermines claims made by Heathrow that less people would suffer from aircraft noise if it were given the green light to build a third runway. Heathrow accused Gatwick of failing to publish all the technical documents related to its own expansion plans . Heathrow previously stated the number of people 'significantly annoyed' by aircraft noise would reduce from 237,350 to between 187,000 and 202,900, even with an additional runway, as a result of steeper landing approaches and quieter aircraft. Gatwick, however, labelled these figures as 'disingenuous' and commissioned the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to model the noise impact of its west London competitor. Gatwick's dossier stated that once the Heathrow runway was at its full capacity the number of people affected by the noise would actually increase by 20,650 to 258,000. Heathrow insisted that its noise figures were also based on CAA modelling and accused Gatwick of failing to publish all the technical documents related to its own expansion plans. The document, that was found on the train, was reportedly discussed by Gatwick bosses last month and questions when to submit its findings to Sir Howard Davies and the commission.

"By . Brian Viner . Mick Channon did not get where he is today — master of all he surveys at the splendid West Ilsley stables in Berkshire — by mincing his words. ‘For me, Wayne Rooney is not the strong link, he’s the weak link,’ says the 65-year-old former England striker of the man whose form seems crucial if Roy Hodgson’s team are to prosper at the World Cup. ‘I’ve got a lot of time for him but he’s never delivered in World Cups, has he? This time, he’s got to come to the party. It’s time to step up, boy.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney at England's training camp in Portugal . Improvement needed: Mick Channon speaks to Sportsmail, and admits Rooney is England's weak link . The man? Rooney, going to his third World Cup, is desperate to prove his worth on the biggest stage . Channon’s own football career sometimes seems to him like another lifetime now he is a Flat racing trainer of renown but he remains a perceptive football  analyst, especially of those who operate where he used to, in and around the opposition penalty area. He has reservations about all four forwards — Rooney, Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck and Rickie Lambert — in Hodgson’s squad. ‘Sturridge and Welbeck have got legs, but whether they’re good enough, or have the right temperament, I’m not so sure,’ says Channon. ‘They’re only going to pick up bits and pieces out there. They’ve got to make something out of nothing, and can they adapt to that? If anyone thinks England are going to play an all-out attacking game, well, they might as well keep the plane engines running because they’ll be coming straight home.’ As for Lambert, a potent force with Channon’s beloved Southampton, he says: ‘He has a good football brain. He lacks pace, but he’s a decent finisher. If we’re winning 1-0, stick him on, he might get another but I’m sure Hodgson will start with Rooney, more for what he’s capable of, not for what he’s done.’ Strike! Channon (left) scored 21 goals in 45 appearances for England . Paired up: Daniel Sturridge and Wayne Rooney are likely to be England's first-choice front two up front . That said, Channon thinks England will make it through the group stages. ‘If we play as a team, we’ll do better than people think. Caps: 46. Goals: 21 (inc 2 pens) Debut: October 11, 1972 (age 23) England 1 Yugoslavia 1 . First goal: Scotland 0 England 5 February 14, 1973 . Last goal: England 1 Scotland 2 June 4, 1977 . Last match:  Switzerland 0 England 0 September 7, 1977 . Channon is 18th on the list of England’s all-time top scorers — equal with Kevin Keegan. He is the most capped England player never to play in a major tournament. 'My first choice was Harry Redknapp to be England manager, but I respect Hodgson. He has them functioning as a team. Whether they’re good enough is another matter. ‘For years managers have been obsessed with picking the best players in each position, but it’s not the best players who make the best team. That’s why Germany have done so well, and (Hodgson) understands it too, as Alf Ramsey did. ‘Look at the team who won in 1966. Bobby Charlton was a luxury. He never tackled anyone in his life. Alf played Nobby Stiles so that he could afford the luxury of Charlton. He sacrificed Jimmy Greaves, and played Roger Hunt and Geoff Hurst because they worked hard. And he never asked you to do something you didn’t do at club level. That was Alf’s great strength.’ Channon made his England debut under . Ramsey, against Yugoslavia in October 1972. There were still two World . Cup winners in the side, Bobby Moore and Alan Ball, and when Channon won . the last of his 46 England caps five years (and 21 goals) later, he . lined up alongside Kevin Keegan and Trevor Francis. Facing the press: Wayne Rooney speaks to the media during a press conference in Portugal . Yet those were barren years for England. At least Rooney still has the chance to score in a World Cup. Channon never even got there. ‘Yeah, I can still remember sitting in the dressing room after the Poland game (October 1973, when a 1-1 draw at Wembley meant England missed out on the 1974 finals). ‘That wasn’t where we threw it away, . though. It was in Poland where we got beat two-zip. It was one of Alf’s . rare mistakes. But Alf’s teams were the best I played in for England. The very best was probably the one that got stopped by the Poland . keeper, Jan Tomaszewski. Affection: Rooney ran over to kiss son Kai after an England training session at Vale Do Lobo on Wednesday . ‘Later, under Don Revie, we had good players without being a team. He kept making changes. Under Alf, once you got into the side, the hardest thing was to get out of it.’ Hodgson not only understands the team ethic as Ramsey did,  ventures Channon, but he inspires similar loyalty. ‘The players seem to like him and believe in what he’s doing. They’re probably not as good as the players Alf had, but he can make them hard to beat. ‘That back four has to be solid. Gerrard will sit deep, so we don’t get exposed. After that, he needs a hod-carrier like Bally. Who will that be? Jordan Henderson? Going forward from the middle Ross Barkley is terrific but he’s maybe a bit naive. I’d start with Adam Lallana. He makes things happen.’ Younger days: Rooney gestures during Germany 2006, the first World Cup tournament he played . Channon adds that Southampton will not easily replace Lallana if the player is sold this summer. ‘You’re always sad to lose players who can win games for you. I was one, Matt Le Tissier was another. If you don’t replace them with a match-winner, you’re in trouble.’ He buys four Southampton  season tickets every year, he says, but such are the demands of horse racing, Channon gets to St Mary’s only five or six times. ‘My two sons go, and the grandchildren. They’re Southampton nuts.’ When he does go, does he still find himself besieged by autograph hunters? After all, he scored a record 185 league goals for the Saints, and was instrumental in the famous FA Cup win of 1976. Relaxed: Rooney looks chilled as he poses for the camera after a press conference in the Algarve . Channon snorts. ‘I don’t go because I want people to tell me how great I was. I’ve no time for all that.’ All the same, he is not immune to nostalgia. Hanging in his office is a huge black-and-white photograph of him in his Southampton days, alongside his great mate, the late Alan Ball. ‘Bless him,’ he says, with a smile. England could do with a latter-day Ball now, I suggest. ‘Yeah, but they’ve got what they’ve got.’ There’s no arguing with that, and so assuming that England will not win the World Cup, who will? ‘Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Germany. Probably one of those. And Belgium have a lot of good players, haven’t they? But I keep coming back to it. The best players don’t necessarily make the best team.’","Mick Channon questioned Wayne Rooney's World Cup record .

And before long his jobless partner had moved in as well - prompting his parents to snap and said he would either have to get a job or move out. When he again refused they said they had no choice other than to take him to court. They did, and were successful after the court ruled that although Qing was their son, at the age of 29 they no longer had an obligation to support him and that as it was their house they could also force him to move out.

Keith Matthew Emerald, 32, is accused of starting a campfire on August 17 last year in an area where fires were prohibited in Stanislaus National Forest. The blaze that took hold a year ago turned into a massive Rim Fire raging for two months across 400 square miles of land after spreading to Yosemite National Park, threatening thousands of structures, destroying 11 homes and costing more than $125million to fight. Keith Matthew Emerald, 32, is accused of starting a campfire on August 17 last year in an area where fires were prohibited in Stanislaus National Forest. A firefighter is pictured battling the blaze . Investigators Investigators focused on Emerald, who was rescued by helicopter about an hour after the fire was reported, and almost immediately and repeatedly interviewed him over the course of the following several weeks while firefighters battled the blaze. Officers said Emarald at times acknowledged starting the fire and other times denied it. Hunting for deer with a bow that day, he initially told investigators that he caused a rock slide that sparked the fire, according to a search warrant affidavit for Emerald’s house and other sites. He then allegedly suggested it was started by marijuana growers in the area. Keith Matthew Emerald allegedly tried to claim that the fire was started by marijuana growers in the area, it is claimed. The Rim Fire is pictured burning near Yosemite National Park . After multiple interviews and a promise from investigators that they would keep his name out of the media for as long as they could, he acknowledged having a lighter, starting a fire and cooking a meal, according to the affidavit. He burned rubbish from his backpack, but some of the embers blew uphill and set the brush on fire, he allegedly told investigators in a handwritten statement with some misspellings. ‘The terrain was almost vertical, so I physically couldn't put it out,’ he wrote. He later went back on this comment, but investigators said a man who drove Emerald to pick up his truck after the fire began said the hunter acknowledged setting a campfire that got out of control. Calls to Emerald’s attorney, federal public defender Janet Bateman, have not yet been returned, AP reports. Devastation: The wildfire that ripped through Stanislaus National Forest and Yosemite National Park was one of the largest ever, destroying buildings and costing millions of dollars to fight . Emerald, a resident of Columbia, a town in the Sierra Nevada foothills, is also charged with lying to a federal agent. Prosecutors said no court date has been set for his arraignment. 'The Rim Fire was one of the largest in California history and caused tremendous economic and environmental harm,' U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner said in a written statement. 'While those harms cannot be undone, today we have brought criminal charges relating to the cause of the fire.'

"By . Julian Robinson . One of the earliest photos of The Beatles in Liverpool's Cavern Club is to be auctioned along with a series of other recently unearthed snaps of the band at the beginning of their career. The picture, taken in 1961, features Paul McCartney at the front of the stage and Pete Best on drums - a year before he was replaced by Ringo Starr. Stephen Bailey - the manager of The Beatles Shop, in Liverpool - said the memorabilia sale includes a series of negatives brought into the Mathew Street store by a man who casually told him: 'My father was a professional photographer and these might be of interest to you.' Scroll down for video . Early days: The picture, taken in 1961, features Paul McCartney at the front of the stage and Pete Best on drums during a performance at Liverpool's Cavern Club . Mr Bailey said the man handed over a series of envelopes of transparencies which all turned out to be in perfect condition. Another shot which stands out features George Harrison, John Lennon, McCartney and Best posing with six girls. Mr Bailey said he did some detective work on this photograph and found out it was taken on June 14, 1961, at St John's Hall, Tuebrook, Liverpool - the first date the band played after returning from Hamburg. He has also traced two of the girls in the picture. One of the others has died, he has learned, but he is still looking for the other three. 'It's a lovely photograph and so evocative of the relationship The Beatles had with their early fans,' Mr Bailey said. The memorabilia includes a photo featuring George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Pete Best posing with six girls . 'I am very excited about the auction. It just gets bigger and better every year.' Mr Bailey, who has managed The Beatles Shop for 28 years, said there will 330 lots at the auction including rare first, second and third editions of the legendary Merseybeat magazine, published in 1961. He said these recently came light when another customer calmly walked into the store and said: 'I thought that you might like to look at these.' He said he thinks the Cavern Club pictures could fetch £1,500 and the Merseybeat magazine could go for between £2,500 and £3,000. The Annual Liverpool Beatles Auction will be held in the Paul McCartney Auditorium at the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts on Saturday, August 23.","Picture taken in 1961 at Liverpool's Cavern Club to be auctioned this month .

"By . Julian Robinson . An underage boy was 'groomed' by a man 26 years his senior after they met on gay hook-up app Grindr, a court has heard. Gary Pearce messaged and swapped naked photographs with the 14-year-old on the Grindr app over the course of several weeks before arranging a meeting for sex, it was said. The boy had been 'curious' when he downloaded the app, which is for over-18s, and then lied about his age to sign up, it was said. Scroll down for video . Gary Pearce messages a 14-year-old boy on the Grindr app over the course of several weeks before arranging a meeting for sex, jurors heard at Inner London Crown Court (pictured) Pearce, 40, then drove in his silver sports car to meet the boy in the car park of Asda in Bexleyheath at the end of the summer holidays in 2012, Inner London Crown Court heard. They then went back to Pearce's house in Sidcup, Kent, where they engaged in a sex act and showered before Pearce dropped him back at the car park. However, the boy's mother discovered messages on her son's mobile phone and confronted him before calling the police. When Pearce was arrested, detectives found four indecent images of children in the trash folder of his computer which had been downloaded sometime around 2009. The boy had been 'curious' when he downloaded the app, which is for over-18s, and then lied about his age to sign up, the court heard (file image) He admitted picking up the teenager and engaging in a sex act but maintains he thought he was over the age of 16 - the age of consent. He denies sexual activity with a child, meeting with a child following sexual grooming and making by downloading indecent images of children. The jury was played a video interview given by the boy wearing his school uniform in December 2012 during which he insisted he told Pearce his real age early on. He told detectives 'I said how old I was, I said I was 14 or 15' before the messaging continued. Describing how they eventually met, the boy added: 'He waved at me and I was nervous because obviously I had never done it before. 'I don't remember what we talked about but he put his hand on my leg. I didn't expect it so I jumped but not too much.' They then went to the home and the boy said that he had been shown around the house adding: 'We stripped down and we were kissing.' Asked if he had wanted to engage in the sex act, the teenager said: 'I didn't know what I wanted because obviously I was trying it out.' Asked how he felt about what had happened during the interview, weeks after meeting Pearce he said: 'Well I now have sort of a girlfriend.' The trial continues.

"By . Bianca London . Take a look at the feet of any A-lister and it's likely you'll catch a flash of red. From Victoria Beckham to Lily Allen, the iconic Christian Louboutin red sole has adorned many of the world's most famous feet. And according to the French designer himself, even the super stylish Duchess of Cambridge has a pair stashed away, gifted to her by none other than Mrs Beckham. Scroll down for video . Footwear fans: Victoria Beckham gave the Duchess of Cambridge a pair of Christian Louboutin boots, revealed the French footwear designer . 'I know that Victoria Beckham offered her a pair of my boots and she looked great in them. She's been photographed wearing my boots. She looked fantastic,' he told The Times. Victoria, 41, is known for her penchant for sky-high stilettos so it comes as no surprise that she's one of Louboutin's greatest fans. However, sadly for Victoria and his army of A-list fans, Louboutin, who now has 91 standalone shops in 55 countries, admits that he doesn't think about comfort when designing his heels. Man of the hour: Christian Louboutin, 51, revealed the information when he was promoting his debut beauty range, which consists of 31 nail varnishes . Famous fan: Victoria, 41, is known for her penchant for sky-high stilettos so it comes as no surprise that she's one of Louboutin's greatest fans and has been wearing them since her she first burst onto the showbiz scene, right . He said: 'The first emotion I want to provoke is: ""How beautiful! How sexy!"" I don't want people to think: ""How comfortable."" 'Being tall can often be a great thing for men and women. I remember a woman thanking me because she applied for a job wearing my shoes and got it. I said don't give me the credit - they might have given you some confidence, but I doubt anyone would give you a job because of your shoes. I wouldn't.' That's ironic coming from the man who decided he wanted to start making shoes when he was just 12. Big sellers: His shoes are loved by the likes of Amanda Holden, left, and Hayden Panettiere, and he now has 91 stores across 55 countries . Fast forward to 1991 and he had opened his first shoe shop, with Princess Caroline of Monaco as its first customer. Clients such as Diane von Fürstenberg, Blake Lively, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kim Kardashian followed and Louboutins have gone on to become the most searched-for shoe on Google. Clearly keen to cash in on his success, the 51-year-old, whose shoes can cost between £480 and £2,000, has just launched his debut beauty range complete with 31 nail varnishes inspired by his famous shoes. In fact, the reason the soles are red are because he 'felt as though something was missing' when he saw his first prototype shoe and decided to paint the bottom with his assistant's red nail varnish. The Rouge Louboutin, inspired by that original red polish, will be the first colour to be unveiled on July 24, with 30 more to follow this summer. The collection will be available at Harrods, Selfridges, Harvey Nichols and in Christian Louboutin stores.

"By . Julian Robinson . An actor with an uncanny resemblance to Rob Ford is to take on the role of Toronto's controversial mayor in a new musical comedy. Sheldon Bergstrom, a portly 42-year-old Canadian who dyed his hair blond, said he begged producers to audition for the part in 'Rob Ford the Musical: Birth of A Ford Nation'. The musical is set to debut at Toronto's Factory Theatre in September - just over a month before the infamous politician seeks re-election. Uncanny: Actor Sheldon Bergstrom, left, is set to play the part of Rob Ford, right, in a new musical comedy about the controversial Toronto mayor . The 90-minute show has ten original tunes and sees a 'spiritual guide' leading Ford through the past year of his tumultuous life — including his admitted drug use and stint in rehab. Producers said the actor won the role over nearly 100 other hopeful actors, including one who is starring on Broadway. Mr Bergstrom said: 'All across Canada, all throughout the world, people are watching this man, this mayor of ... Canada's greatest city, and he has managed to pull off some amazing things and pull off some crazy things in his time as mayor. He added that the script gives Ford a 'fair shake' and that it was not an attempt to pick on Ford, who has gone from one controversy to another since admitting last year that he had smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor.' Lookalike: Producers said the Sheldon Bergstrom, pictured, won the role over nearly 100 other hopeful actors, including one who is starring on Broadway . The 90-minute show has ten original tunes and sees a 'spiritual guide' leading Rob Ford, pictured in 2013, through the past year of his tumultuous life - including his admitted drug use and stint in rehab. Ford returned to work in June after a two-month stint in rehab, pledging an 'unwavering' commitment to living clean. His duties as mayor have been curtailed since last year, when Toronto's City Council stripped him of most of his powers. Writer Brett McCaig said that resemblance, as well as the actor's talent, got him the part. And he hopes the show will be extended, with ambitions of going 'off-Broadway' with the production. But that will depend on the outcome of the mayoral race, he said. Doppleganger: The musical's writer Brett McCaig said that resemblance, as well as the actor's talent, got Sheldon Bergstrom, pictured, the part . Representatives for Rob Ford, pictured, have reportedly expressed indifference about the musical . 'The story dies if Rob doesn't get voted back in,' he added. 'If Rob gets voted back in, I think we've got legs for a continued run, for sure.' Rob Ford's spokesman Amin Massoudi expressed indifference about the musical, repeating a phrase that the mayor has taken to using when asked about his personal troubles: 'This is not news.' 'The mayor is concerned with running an efficient municipal government, creating jobs and building more subways in Toronto,' Massoudi said.","Sheldon Bergstrom to play role of Toronto's controversial mayor Rob Ford .

"By . Julian Robinson . Saheena Tegally, pictured, has been cleared of trying to let an uninsured driver off following a flirtatious exchange of messages . A policewoman accused of trying to let an uninsured Porsche driver off after they exchanged flirtatious messages has been cleared of perverting the course of justice. WPC Saheena Tegally, 26, swapped numbers with Richard Myerson after she pulled him over for an insurance check, London's Wood Green Crown Court heard. They sent texts and emails to each other, including one in which Mr Myerson suggested the Metropolitan Police officer should sit at her desk in her underwear after she complained about the heat, the jury was told. In another message, the court heard the West Hampstead-based officer told Mr Myerson 'It's really hot. I'm in my bikini catching the sun.' Prosecutors claimed WPC Tegally falsely told other officers that Mr Myerson had been covered when he was stopped because he was flirting with her and asked her out on a date. But she denied perverting the course of justice, telling her trial that the messages the couple swapped were just 'banter' and she never had any intention of meeting him on a date. The jury of eight women and four men unanimously found WPC Tegally not guilty of perverting the course of justice today, less than two hours after they retired to consider their verdicts. Wearing a black blazer, pink top and black skirt, WPC Tegally, of London Colney, Hertfordshire, broke down in tears in the dock and hugged members of her family after leaving the courtroom. Following the verdict, WPC Tegally said: 'I'm just pleased. I just want to go home.' Her mother added: 'She needs to rest, it's been a tough year.' During the trial, WPC Tegally said that at the time of the alleged offence in July last year she had just broken off a relationship, during which she had undergone an abortion. The court heard the officer sent Mr Myerson a text saying 'far too hot to be stuck in uniform', to which he replied 'you could sit behind your desk in your underwear, then people will take bad news much easier'. Saheena Tegally (pictured) of London Colney, Hertfordshire, broke down in tears in the dock after a jury cleared her of perverting the course of justice . She admitted she had been 'flattered' by the attention after the court heard she sent a text to a friend, saying she had 'seized a Porsche off a 25-year-old, he is minted and has asked to take me out'. During cross-examination, Miss Tegally said: 'It was flattering, yes it was. But that doesn't for one minute mean I was going to meet up with him or go for a drink. 'It was never my plan to go with him.' She told the jury she had still been in love with her ex-partner at the time, and still was, so would not have met up with Mr Myerson. Ms Tegally admitted that she helped Mr Myerson receive insurance documents and was sent via email documents showing he had not been insured but claimed she did not read them closely and initially assumed he was covered. She told the court it was just a mistake on her part and that she had never told her superiors definitively that he had been legally driving, only telling them it 'looked like' he was. She also denied a prosecution claim that she deliberately deleted emails relating to the case. Outside London's Wood Green Crown Court, Ms Tegally said: 'I'm just pleased. I just want to go home.' She said she created a proper 'paper trail' but the emails may have been lost after she deleted a large number from her account simultaneously without checking them, following a warning about not having enough space. She added: 'Although I was going through a bad time, I worked hard to become a police officer. 'I was struggling but it was, and still is, my life.' Ms Tegally, who joined the Met as a community support officer in 2007, was suspended by the force pending the outcome of the trial. A Scotland Yard spokesman said she remained suspended pending the outcome of a misconduct review hearing.","WPC Saheena Tegally cleared in court of perverting the course of justice .

"By . Julian Robinson . Afsor Ali, pictured, has been accused in court of keeping terror tutorials on his MP3 player . A Muslim extremist had a library of terror manuals including personal tutorials on Jihad with radical preacher Omar Bakri, the Old Bailey has heard. Afsor Ali kept a stash of Al Qaeda documents, bomb making plans, and extremist lectures on his computer, selecting some to carry with him on his MP3 player, the court was told. The 27-year-old also warned of a terrorist attack on the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and called for a Burn American Flag Day in inflammatory YouTube videos, is is said. Ali was allegedly the spokesman of banned extremist group Muslims Against Crusades when he praised the 9/11 suicide bomb attacks on America. Ali was personally counselled by Bakri, the militant cleric dubbed the Tottenham Ayatollah, and recorded two of their conversations about Jihadi fighting and martyrdom. He is on trial accused of having the Al Qaeda magazine Inspire and terrorist manual ‘39 Ways to Serve and Participate in Jihad’ on his computers and MP3 player. Prosecutor Oliver Glasgow said Ali was a leader of Muslims Against Crusades and appeared in four YouTube videos under the alias Abu Assadullah promoting extremism. In one clip, from April 2011, Ali ‘warns the viewer not to attend the Royal Wedding since there’s the risk of an attack by Muslim groups’, he said. ‘He explains to the viewer that the British public have no one to blame except themselves because of the inability to condemn their government.’ Another clip calls for Sharia Law in the UK, while in a third Ali ‘describes 9/11 as a historic event and suggests it has exposed the American ideology to be a fallacy’. ‘He describes the 9/11 atrocity as a blessing and an eye-opener for the American people’, said the prosecutor, of the fourth clip featuring Ali. His activities were investigated after he was arrested outside the American embassy in London on December 2, 2011, while leading a violent protest against drone strikes in Pakistan. Police suspect the group of 30 masked men protesting under the name United Ummah and led by Ali were also members of Muslims Against Crusades. After a violent tussle with police, Ali was arrested and an MP3 player in his pocket was found to contain the Inspire magazine. The magazine, produced by Al Qaeda, was a special edition produced to celebrate the ‘martyrdom’ of Osama Bin Laden. Ali’s laptop and hard drive, seized from his home, in east London contained a library of extremist material, including bomb making tips and guides to using AK47s, the court heard. Afsor Ali, pictured, kept a stash of Al Qaeda documents, bomb making plans, and extremist lectures on his computer, selecting some to carry with him on his MP3 player, the court was told . ‘There was also recordings of phone calls this defendant had with Omar Bakri, a radical ideologue and leader of a militant organisation while he was here in the UK’, said Mr Glasgow. ‘The defendant’s voice has been identified by experts, and the defendant accepts it’s him on the phone speaking to Omar Bakri. ‘This defendant and a colleague were seeking advice on the duty of Muslim males to participate in Jihad, and they discussed the requirement of Muslims to travel abroad to fight for Jihad.’ The court of making warned of a terrorist attack on the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (pictured), a court heard . He said Ali is heard saying it ‘would be sinful’ for them not to go abroad to fight. Ali was picked out at the protest as a leader of the group, shouting angrily at police and leading chanting by the others. ‘He appeared angry and was gesturing and shouting at the police officers’, said Mr Glasgow. ‘He had his fists clenched and he was shouting in anger. Ali had a library of terror manuals including personal tutorials on Jihad with radical preacher Omar Bakri (pictured), the court heard . ‘When an officer tried to detain another person from within the crowd, the defendant lunged forward and pushed the officers backwards.’ Mr Glasgow said the YouTube videos and computer material was only found after his arrest at the protest. The Inspire magazine had been transferred from the computer to the MP3 player, then back again, Mr Glasgow said, and was in a folder stored under the name Assadullah.. He told the court: ‘This defendant is likely to claim he has no idea how these files came to be saved on to his electronic devices. ‘He is likely to claim others had access to the hard disk and the MP3 player. ‘He claims anyone could have downloaded these files or it was downloaded accidentally without his knowledge. ‘If he is correct, and he had no idea what was saved on his computer, MP3 player, and external hard disk, you will want to consider with care the background to the offences. ‘If as we suggest is the case, the defendant was the spokesperson for a radical group of extremists, if the defendant was actively seeking advice from an extremist religious cleric on the duty of Muslims to participate in violent Jihad, if the defendant had a keen interest in religious Jihad and the call for violence against the West, you might want to ask yourself how the very information he was interest in was stored on his computer devices without his knowledge.’ Ali of Bethnal Green, east London, denies four counts of possessing documents containing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.

"By . Sam Webb . and Julian Robinson . The self-styled lord who led the life of an international playboy while masterminding a huge fraud must sell his lavish London home to avoid another decade behind bars. Edward - ‘Fast Eddie’ - Davenport, 48, hosted lavish parties at his mansion - which could sell for £30million - and boasted of befriending guests including supermodel Kate Moss and Princes William and Harry. But the socialite was exposed as a fraudster who duped victims out of their life savings through bogus start-up loan schemes. Now he must sell 33 Portland Place, in Marylebone, central London, to pay back £14million to his victims. Scroll down for video . Edward Davenport, shown left in a police photo,  rubbed shoulders with the rich and famous before his conviction and imprisonment. Right, the £30million mansion in London's Marylebone he must now sell to cover repayments to his victims . Debauched: One of the rooms in the 24-bedroom property, complete with poles for pole dancing . Scenes from the hit film The King's Speech were filmed at 33 Portland Place . He bought the 24-bedroom property for just £50,000 from the Sierra Leone government in . 1999 while the country was embroiled in a civil war. The . five-storey, 110-room house was used for film shoots, a fashion . show and a masquerade ball, while his swimming pool was reportedly . filled with Cognac so revellers could row through it. Scenes . from the Oscar winning film The King's Speech were also filmed there, . and Kate Moss was filmed walking down its staircase wearing nothing but . stiletto heels and underwear for an Agent Provocateur advert. Singer Amy Winehouse used it to shoot the video for her hit song Rehab. A party that took place at the vast property. Music videos were shot there and fashion shows were also held .

The socialite was exposed as a fraudster who duped victims out of their life savings through bogus start-up loan schemes . Famous face: Victoria Silvstedt launches her own lingerie range, 'Very Victoria Silvstedt', at 33 Portland Place, central London . He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'This place wasn’t really related to the offences... so it’s all a bit . unfair that I’m being forced to sell. Quite shockingly unfair, actually.' But investigators from the Serious Fraud Office claim Davenport used some of . the estimated £34.5 million raised through the fraud to buy and revamp the property. It is unclear whether he will retain the estimated remaining £16m from the sale of the property. For two decades, Davenport – the ‘Lord’ refers to a manorial title he bought – was a central  figure in London’s most hedonistic circles. In the late Eighties, his black-tie ‘Gatecrasher Balls’ became notorious for the drunken debauchery of public school-educated teens before they were brought to an abrupt end when he was convicted of tax fraud. The con artist, born Edward Ormus Sharington Davenport, promised millions of pounds to investors which never materialised after he had pocketed the administration fees and advance payments. Edward Davenport, pictured, will now have to sell his central London mansion, at Portland Place, which he bought for a pittance from the Sierra Leone government . Princess Diana’s wedding dress designer Elizabeth Emanuel lost the life savings she invested with Davenport. The . fraudster, who was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years behind bars in . 2011, was not at Southwark Crown Court to hear the Judge Peter Testar’s . ruling earlier this month. Davenport, . who was released from prison on licence in May due to acute kidney . problems will also have to find £1,943,620 in compensation in addition . to a £12million confiscation order. Edward Davenport, pictured left before a previous court appearance and right at 33 Portland Place, must repay £14million or face a decade in jail . Judge . Testar said at the time: ‘Through his dishonesty Edward Davenport has . caused harm to many people and it would be an insensitive judge who was . not conscious of those whom he had defrauded.’ He enticed his victims with a website boasting of his champagne and sports-car lifestyle and a £100m property portfolio in Britain, Thailand and Monaco. Davenport claimed to be a familiar face in ‘exclusive venues across the world’ and had ‘extensive business interests.’ His web page boasts: ‘Welcome to the website of Edward Davenport, one of London’s most flamboyant and best known entrepreneurs as well as a true English gentleman from an established British family.’ Among the stars Davenport was pictured with on the site’s gallery were actors Hugh Grant, Jeremy Irons, Jude Law and Steve Coogan and music mogul Simon Cowell. Davenport, of Portland Place, central London, was convicted after a trial of conspiracy to defraud. His bill could rise to £15,855,273, if he is ordered to meet both prosecution and defence costs.","Edward Davenport duped his victims through bogus start-up schemes, including Lady Diana's wedding dress designer .

"By . Julian Robinson . A soldier transformed his violin into a fascinating diary of his life in the trenches and the battles he fought - by carving names and dates into the wood. Ernest Johnson etched notes of where he had served into the back of the wooden instrument, which he used to to entertain troops during the First World War. The violin, discovered in a plastic bag in a loft, has been fully restored and the poignant diary entries - which include names of infamous Great War battle fields - remain in place. Ernest Johnson is pictured with his wife Jenny and their first two children Jim, four, and Hilda, two, taken in around 1916. The sapper transformed his violin into a fascinating diary of his life in the trenches . The entries include, dates and locations about where Ernest Johnson was serving as well as remarks about periods of leave . At the very top of the violin Ernest, who was 32 when he left for war, scratched: 'This violin is with Sapper E Johnson 143152' followed by his address in North Shields, Tyneside. The first entry read: 'Left Buxton for France, 8/8/1915' and is followed by 20 place names and dates where he saw action including well known battle locations in France, Belgium and Italy. The entries also contain remarks about periods of leave as well as a note about meeting King George on the front line at Messines, Belgium. The last of the etchings reads: 'Finished with army 18-2-19'. During his service Ernest used the violin to entertain his fellow front line soldiers with renditions of popular wartime tunes such as Roses of Picardy and Keep the Home Fires Burning. He died in 1948 and the story of his violin became the stuff of family legend until his granddaughter Jan Evans started researching their family history in 2012. To her surprise she discovered the violin still existed and had been kept in a bag in her cousin's loft for years. Ernest Johson, pictured right, scratched names and dates of  remarks about where he was serving and when he was on leave periods of leave on the back of his violin (left) Ernest Johnson etched notes  of where he had served into the back of the wooden instrument (pictured left and right), which he used to to entertain troops during the First World War . The 64-year-old retired special needs teacher had the violin professionally restored and then embarked on lessons to learn how to play the very same war songs her grandfather would have played in the trenches. The amazing tale has been told for the first time in a new book by Paul Atterbury, an expert on the Antiques Roadshow. The book, called World War One in 100 Family Treasures, highlights stories that came to light in the making of the Antiques Roadshow's WWI centenary programmes but never made it to air. Mrs Evans, from Kendal, Cumbria, said: 'My grandfather came from a musical family and so when he went off to war he took his violin with him. Etchings: Some of the entries on the violin . At the very top of violin Ernest, who was 32 when he left for war, scratched: 'This violin is with Sapper E Johnson 143152' followed by his address in North Shields, Tyneside. The first entry read: 'Left Buxton for France, 8/8/1915' and is followed by 20 place names and dates where he saw action including some of the most infamous battle locations in France, Belgium and Italy. These include La Couture on August 14, 1915 in Northern France and then the battlefields of Neuve Chapelle on Noember 1, 1916 and and Richebourg on January 4 the following year. His travels in the army continue when on June 1, 1916 he was posted to Messines in Belgium, the site of a fearsome Western Front battle the following year. It was here that he made a note about meeting King George on the front line. After 14 days leave, his diary indicates that he left France for Belgium on June 18 before being posted to the port city of Dunkirk on July 5 of that year. In the autumn of that year, he marks on his violin that he is 'Home for today's leave' before adding 'Left Belgium for Italy'. His diary entries list a number of Italian locations throughout 1917. The last of the etchings reads: 'Finished with army 18-2-19'. 'He would have played it to the soldiers in the trenches to entertain them and boost morale. As he travelled around he carved the names and dates of all the places he went to into the back of the violin. 'The writing starts off small because he didn't know how many places he would go to but gets larger as the war continued. 'I never met my grandfather but my grandmother used to tell me that when he came back from war he wasn't the same man she had married. 'He had seen such horrors that he had become quiet and withdrawn and spent his time playing his violin in his bedroom or in his shed at his allotment. 'The story of his violin was known within the family but when I found that it still existed I decided to have it restored and learn to play it. Ernest Johnson, is pictured in the middle row, to the right of the man in the light jacket along with fellow soldiers. 'I wanted to hear it for myself. It is very moving playing the violin but it has brought his memory back to life.' Ernest was 32 when enlisted in the Royal Engineers as a Sapper, leaving the family greengrocers in the hands of his wife Jenny and their two young children Jim and Hilda. He survived four years of service during which he was deeply affected by the horrors of war, so much so that when he returned home to his family he was a different man.

"By . Julian Robinson . A paddle boarder risked his life - and thousands of pounds - by edging within feet of at least two huge humpback whales. Photographer Jodi Frediani captured the dramatic encounter while she was whale watching in Monterey Bay, California. The man was seen repeatedly moving his paddle board towards the giant mammals, which can weigh up to 36 tonnes. Close encounter: The paddle boarder risks his life by moving within metres of two giant humpbacks off the coast of California . Too close for comfort: The man was also risking a fine of more than £6,500 by approaching the mammals in Monterey Bay, California . As well as putting his own life in danger, he was risking more than £6,500  because getting too close to the whales in the wild carries a massive fine. The paddle boarder waited to see where the whales - which can measure up to 16 metres - were feeding and then tried to approach them on 'multiple' occasions. Huge numbers of the creatures have come close to the shore to feed on the summer anchovy crop giving whale watchers the chance to see them up close. With its food source near the surface, wildlife enthusiasts have been able to watch incredible surface lunges that allow the whales to scoop up large numbers of fish. The paddle boarder waited to see where the whales - which can measure up to 16 metres - were feeding and then tried to approach them on 'multiple' occasions . The paddle boarder moves ever closer to a humpbank whale as it surfaces in Monterey Bay during a feeding session . Jodi said: 'This paddle boarder deliberately approached the whales multiple times but this can break the National Marine Fisheries Service guidelines. 'Fortunately for him, none of the whales got irritated enough to lash out with a large tail throw, something we saw them do to a sailboat which sailed right through a group of feeding whales. 'He could have been knocked off his board or seriously hurt if the whales were to come up where he was standing or do a tail lob.

With its food source near the surface, wildlife enthusiasts have been able to watch incredible surface lunges that allow the whales to scoop up large numbers of fish . 'They wouldn't deliberately attempt to hurt a person but they can weigh a huge amount. 'However I've been out to see them several times since this incident and people have been far more respectful. 'They've had amazing encounters with the whales approaching them. 'This year has been an exceptionally wonderful and rare occurrence to have so many humpback whales surface lunge-feeding on anchovies so close to shore.

"By . Julian Robinson . A pilot flying an historic fighter plane was forced to make a dramatic crash landing in front of thousands of airshow spectators today. White smoke could be seen coming from the engine of the Royal Navy Historic Flight's Hawker Sea Fury at the Air Day at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall. The aircraft, which was in the middle of a display, started to experience problems as it was coming in to land and moments later it hit the runway 'hard' before spinning on to grass in front of stunned onlookers. Scroll down for video . White smoke could be seen coming from the engine of the Royal Navy Historic Flight's Hawker Sea Fury as it performed the penultimate display at the RNAS Culdrose Air Day . The aircraft hit the runway 'hard' at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall after losing power shortly before touching down. The pilot was forced to make an emergency landing as thousands watched on . The historic aircraft's undercarriage appeared not to come out as it was coming in to land, according to witnesses.It then skidded along the runway prompting a stunned silence among the thousands of spectators . The aircraft eventually skidded to a halt around 100 metres from where it had touched down following its Air Day display. Emergency crews quickly arrived at the scene, but the pilot was able to climb from his cockpit . The crowd fell silent as the plane skidded along the runway, eventually coming to a halt around 100 metres from where it had touched down. Witnesses reported that the pilot had miraculously  escaped serious injury in the incident and jumped from the cockpit when the plane had come to rest. He was later praised for his skilled handling of the plane as the drama unfolded in front of crowds of up to 30,000. The Hawker Sea Fury was the last British propeller-driven fighter to serve with the Royal Navy. Although it was developed during the Second World War, the Sea Fury entered service two years after the conflict ended. Originally it was commissioned for the RAF, but when they cancelled the order, the Royal Navy stepped in seeing it as a suitable carrier aircraft. Having entered operational service in 1947, it went on to prove popular overseas and was used during the Korean War in the early 1950s. It attracted international orders as both a carrier and land-based aircraft and was operated by countries including Australia, Burma, Canada, Cuba, Egypt, West Germany, Iraq, and Pakistan. More than 860 of the planes were built between 1945 and 1955. It was designed to have a top speed of 460 mph and a wingspan of 12 metres. Several remain airworthy in the present day both as heritage and racing aircraft. The Royal Navy Historic Flight maintains and flies a small number of aircraft that are important to British Naval aviation. The organisation provides aircraft for air displays and is not part of the military establishment. It is staffed by civilians and is based at Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton, Somerset. The plane's under carriage appeared not to have come out in time. There was no fire and the plane had come down on the opposite side of the runway from the audience. Displays were suspended immediately while investigations got underway this afternoon.The exact cause of the problem is not yet known. This afternoon, RNAS Culdrose tweeted: 'Everyone do not panic. The main thing is the pilot is okay and fire engines are on scene.' Displays were suspended at RNAS Culdrose while investigations got underway this afternoon. A spokesman for the base said that the pilot was uninjured . Emergency services rushed to the scene, but no fire was reported. The pilot jumped from the cockpit after the plane had come to a halt and is reportedly uninjured following the ordeal . The incident happened during the penultimate display of the annual event this afternoon. It is thought the aircraft suffered mechanical problems and lost power as it was coming in to land. According to the The Cornishman newspaper, the pilot, Chris Gotke, made a request to land but then suffered further problems releasing the undercarriage of the plane. RNAS Culdrose told the thousands of visitors to its Air Day not to panic after the emergency landing . Witnesses described the landing as 'an amazing piece of emergency flying' while others took to Twitter to praise the actions of the pilot. The Helston base's communications officer Pete Wooldridge told the Cornishman: 'The pilot is fine, he leapt out as soon as the plane came to a halt and he is walking around. 'There is no fire and no one has been hurt. But scheduled events have currently been suspended.'","Smoke was seen coming from Royal Navy Historic Flight's Hawker Sea Fury during penultimate display at airshow .

"By . Julian Robinson . Thousands of BT staff are today set to cash in on shares worth £1.1 billion after a share scheme  paid out an average of nearly £42,000 each. The telecoms giant said the five-year share ownership scheme, which began in 2009, was 'one of the UK's largest broad-based employee share plan maturities ever'. Almost 23,000 staff who joined the plan saved between £5 and £225 every month until this month, meaning that they can now buy BT shares at 61p - a 14p discount to their level five years ago when the firm faced tough times. Scroll down for video . Almost 23,000 BT staff will cash in on shares worth a massive £1.1billion after the company's five-year share scheme paid out an average of £42,000 each. BT chief executive Gavin Patterson, pictured, says he is 'delighted' When the FTSE 100 closed last night BT shares were worth 388.5p, an enormous payout that will in the main go to engineers and call centre workers. Around 7,000 workers saved the maximum £225 a month, which means they are in line for a payout of £89,705 based on last night's prices. BT adds that the scheme includes a number of BT couples who saved the maximum and are now looking at a £179,410 windfall. The average worker saved £124 a month. Five-year BT share graph: When the FTSE 100 closed last night BT shares were worth 388.5p - an enormous payout that will in the main go to engineers and call centre workers . The BT workers in the scheme, who make up about one third of the telecom giant's UK staff, invested £177 million and are now in line for a payout worth £1.1 billion between them. BT chief executive Gavin Patterson said: 'I'm delighted that so many BT people are sharing in the company's success through our saveshare plan. 'BT was facing tough times five years ago and this was reflected in the share price.' Former chief executive Ian Livingston, who left the business last year, is credited with successfully reviving BT. Thousands of BT staff have been celebrating huge pay outs today. But there are some customers who have been less than impressed with their service in the last year. Here are five examples where the customer has suffered: . In September last year, a man claimed his 87-year-old mother Joan Bibby had been left stuck in her own home after BT workmen dug a four foot wide trench outside her property in Claughton, Merseyside. Joan Bibby pictured at the gate of her home after a 4ft-wide trench was dug outside her gates by BT workmen . The work took place on behalf of BT Openreach and without warning according to Mrs Bibby's son who said she had no way of getting out. However, BT said that she had been made aware of the works taking place and a ramp had been fitted outside the property. BT Sport was forced to apologise earlier this month after cutting to an advert break while the Newcastle United manager and captain were laying wreaths on the seats of two fans who died in the MH17 disaster. Producers only cut back to the Newcastle v Sydney FC match for half of the minute’s silence for John Alder, 63, and Liam Sweeney, 28. A BT Sport spokesman later apologised for the incident and played the missing footage later and online. In March, BT became the most complained about broadband provider for the first time according to figures from Ofcom. The level of complaints the industry watchdog received about BT was 0.32 per 1,000 customers with most of them about loss of service or unhappiness with the way those complaints were handled. BT faced a Twitter storm in June after customers complained that they were experiencing internet connection problems. The company, which provides broadband to seven million UK subscribers, was forced to apologise and said it was unable to say how many customers had been affected. In February BT was ordered to refund thousands of customers it overcharged in a directory enquiries rip-off. They were kept hanging on the line, unaware it was costing them £2.39 a minute with many of the victims elderly or vulnerable. BT, which failed to make its charges clear to callers kept waiting on its 118 500 number, was also fined £225,000 by the premium rate number watchdog PhonepayPlus. It imposed the fine and ordered the refunds after a tribunal ruled BT's failures were 'very serious'. When he became BT boss in June 2008, the former state-owned monopoly was burdened with huge debts and spiralling costs. He spearheaded a major turnaround, which involved slashing overheads and bringing its pension deficit under control. More recently Mr Livingston oversaw the rolling out of super-fast fibre optic broadband and last year expanded into sport broadcasting with a deal to show live Premier League games.","Nearly 23,000 staff are set to cash in on BT shares worth £1.1billion .

"By . Julian Robinson . Thavisha Lakindu Peiris was brutally stabbed to death while delivering pizzas . Two cousins are each facing a life sentence after a pizza delivery driver was brutally stabbed to death - on his last shift before starting a career in IT. Shamraze Khan, 25, and Kasim Ahmed, 18, killed Domino’s Pizza employee Thavisha Lakindu Peiris after trying to rob his phone last October in Sheffield. Khan, of Southey Crescent, Southey, was convicted by a jury at Sheffield Crown Court following a two-week trial. Ahmed, of Ronans Road, Darnall, pleaded guilty to Mr Peiris’ murder on the first day of the trial. Both men also admitted a robbery they committed earlier on the day of the murder in the Castle Markets area of Sheffield, just hours before trying to steal the IT student’s phone, then murdering him. The court heard how they struck as Sri Lankan-born Mr Peiris parked his car to deliver his last two pizzas. A struggle took place as Mr Peiris fought back and he was stabbed several times in the neck, chest, face and arms with one wound penetrating his heart. The hooded robbers left their victim to bleed to death in the driver’s seat of the Toyota Yaris at around 10.30pm on Southey Crescent on Sunday October 27. The Sri Lanka-born victim, 25, was studying IT at Sheffield Hallam University and worked for Domino’s to support his education. He had just successfully applied for a job as an IT consultant in the city and the fatal delivery was supposed to be his last. CCTV, forensic evidence and the public’s help led police to the killers. Kasim Ahmed, pictured left, pleaded guilty to Mr Peiris’ murder on the first day of the trial. A jury has also found Shamraze Khan guilty of murder . The student had been working at a branch of Domino's Pizza in Sheffield and was delivering an order to an address in Southey. When he failed to deliver the order, his workmates set off to find him . After the hearing superintendent Lisa Ray, who led the investigation, called the murder 'brutal' and 'senseless' before praising the family for the way they supported police efforts. 'Whilst nothing can fill the void or replace the loss of Thavisha, I hope his family can take some comfort knowing that justice has been served,' she added. His family said in a statement: 'We are still devastated and heartbroken over the loss of Thavisha and we are still unable to comprehend that he is actually gone. 'He gave us so many reasons to smile and was so caring and loving. All we have left are our memories, but they will never fill the void in our hearts. He will never again be with us and we will never hear his voice again. Crime scene: The street where Mr Peiris was stabbed to death while delivering pizzas .

'We sent our son to the UK to study so he could have a better life; we never thought he would be in any danger. 'The way in which he was taken from us is absolutely devastating, we cannot understand why anyone would do this to another human being and it fills us with such sadness. 'We were extremely proud of Thavisha’s achievements and we were so happy that he was doing so well in England. He was such a kind and considerate man, always full of life and always with a smile on his face, anyone who met him immediately liked him. 'We would never want another family to go through such a tragic loss and endure the pain that we feel; Thavisha was the centre of our world and we will never get over losing him.'

"By . Julian Robinson . Four teenagers were arrested today during a dramatic raid by a moped gang on a luxury watch shop in London's West End. Undercover officers were lying in wait as two pillion passengers jumped off their bikes and allegedly started smashing in to Parmigiani in Mount Street, Mayfair using hammers. One teen was arrested at the scene and three others were detained after allegedly running off down side alleys, police revealed, and it was claimed one of the youths was 'carrying a knife'. Undercover police are pictured pinning down and arresting a man at the scene of the raid today . Police say a taxi collided with one of the mopeds during an alleged raid at the luxury watch shop in Mayfair . Four teenagers were arrested after a failed attempt to smash into Parmigiani in Mayfair . During the incident, a taxi collided with one of the mopeds - though it is not yet clear how or why this happened. The attempted raid unfolded this morning and comes after a series of recent 'smash and grab' robberies in the West End, including two at London's five-star Dorchester hotel within a month. Police were ready to pounce today after they went undercover. Now a Scotland Yard detective has warned that smash and grab raids are 'in fashion' in the West End with luxury boutiques seen as easy targets for violent gangs. Speaking at the scene this afternoon, DCI Paul Johnson said the arrests of the 16, 17 and two 18-year-olds, were part of a 'fast-moving intelligence-led operation'. They are all being questioned at London police stations. A hammer is pictured on the ground at the scene of the alleged raid . Police say two men tried to smash in to the shop, in Mount Street in London's West End using hammers . It came as part of a Met crackdown on smash and grab raids, dubbed Operation Morgold. DCI Johnson said: 'These . raids are in fashion and we are going to take them out of fashion, we . are going to show people that they are going to get put before the court . and suitably punished if they carry out these crimes. 'Cash in transit robberies have fallen 30 per cent year on year over the past four years and are continuing downwards. 'We . have worked with the cash in transit industry to improve security and . safety and as a result it is now harder for criminals to get away with . them. 'As a result they are turning to the expensive shops in the West End.' No items were stolen this afternoon and none of the staff inside were injured, he said. Police descended on the scene and taped off the jewellery shop after the alleged raid on Wednesday morning . The incident was being investigated as part of the Met's Operation Morgold probing the recent rise in smash and grabs . But the detective could not say if the boutique's staff or management were aware the police were expecting trouble on the street. He . said: 'Our intelligence led us to expect a robbery on this street, . there are a lot of high-end stores in the area so any one could have . been the target.' 'We . will not comment on how many officers we had on the scene beforehand, . although they included surveillance specialists and officers from the . Flying Squad.' Commenting . on considerations for the public's safety he said: 'We were not armed . today. Smash and grab raids tend to involve hammers but generally they . are not armed. 'If we had intelligence to suggest they were, we would have prepared for that. 'We undertake a full risk assessment before any operation and no one was hurt today.'","Four arrested after alleged raid on luxury watch shop in London's Mayfair .

He is wanted in connection with the murder of Bei Cater, 49, who was found dead at Morayland Hotel, Marshall Avenue, Bridlington, East Yorkshire, late on Friday night. Humberside Police revealed he is also wanted in connection with a serious offence in Rotherham. Mr Heald, who is from South Yorkshire, was believed to have been staying at the guest house before she was killed.

"By . Julian Robinson . A former railway ticket office converted into a 'genuinely one-off' home has gone on the market - for £200,000. Potential buyers have been making tracks to the historic house in Scotland where passengers once paid their fares to use the Denburn Valley line. Estate agents are marketing the old station house on Aberdeen's Hutcheon Street as a 'unique' opportunity - and have reported 'significant interest'. The red-brick station house, pictured, on Aberdeen's Hutcheon Street, was put up for sale with an asking price of more than £200,000 . The two-storey, red-brick building sold tickets to passengers on the Denburn Valley Line from 1887 until 1937, when the line was discontinued . The two-storey, red-brick building sold tickets to passengers on the Denburn Valley Line from 1887 until 1937, when the line was discontinued. Since then it has had a varied history acting as a drum shop and blade sharpening business before being converted into a house in 1999. Current owner Richard Cowie, 56, has decided to sell his home as he prepares for retirement. He said: 'I'll be sorry to leave this place. It's so unique. The former ticket office has had a varied history acting as a drum shop and blade sharpening business before being converted into a house in 1999 . First class: The station ticket office has already attracted plenty of interest after it was put on the market by its current owners . The Denburn line carried commuters from Aberdeen's suburbs into the city's factories but was closed in the late 30s as tram and bus services improved . 'I moved here about four years ago and this place has just had such a terrific old-fashioned feel to it. 'I'm hoping to retire soon though and I need a place with a garage to keep me occupied.' The Denburn line carried commuters from Aberdeen's suburbs into the city's factories but was closed in the late 30s as tram and bus services improved. Offshore worker Mr Cowie added that the red brick house was well known in granite grey Aberdeen. All change: The building has converted in to a house in 1999 . Estate agents have described the old ticket office as a 'charming and unique accommodation across two floors' He said: 'I like the granite but everybody locally knows my house - even if they don't realise that it is a house. 'It does stand out from the surroundings. It's a red brick cottage in a street full of granite tenements. 'I think that is what has interested a lot of people in it. There have been significant numbers of people coming to view it in the last few days. 'I bought it because I needed somewhere smaller after my kids grew up and flew the nest, I didn't really think too hard about the history first. Current owner Richard Cowie, 56, has decided to sell his home as he prepares for retirement . Original features: The property retains some reminders of its past use as a ticket office . Standing-out: The building is well known in and around Aberdeen . '""Quaint"" is a word that's come up a lot with the viewers and they all comment on how much bigger it is on the inside. 'People think it's going to be much smaller until they open the door and it opens out, like Dr. Who's TARDIS. 'It's all been positive so far.' Agents Simpson and Marwick said: 'This is a genuinely one-off property, in ready-to-move into order.

"By . Julian Robinson . Furious pensioners have been ordered to replace their letterboxes for health and safety reasons - at a cost of £350. Residents at Sweetbriar House in Gloucestershire were called to a meeting by housing association Jephson and told their letterboxes no longer complied with fire safety rules. The company said changes must be made to meet new fire regulations and it asked a contractor to provide the quote as a 'goodwill gesture'. Residents at Sweetbriar House, in Churchdown, Gloucestershire, have been told they have got to replace their letterboxes, pictured, for health and safety reasons . But the 32 residents - aged between 55 and 90 - said they are unable to afford the quote and have slammed the company for the 'rip-off' request. A spokeswoman for Jephson was unable to explain the difference between the existing and proposed letterboxes - but said the current ones did not comply with regulations. Walter Griffiths, 67, said: 'This is absolutely ridiculous. 'I don’t know anybody who would pay that money for a letterbox and there are quite a few people that are going to refuse to do it. 'They seem to find expensive ways of doing things. Everybody here is over 55 and we have people who are 90. 'There are a lot of people who don’t have an awful lot of money and just their pension to live on - they are not rich people.' The leasehold homes in Churchdown, Gloucestershire were built in 1988 and are let by Jephson. Residents at Sweetbriar House, pictured, said they were given a quote of £350 to replace their letterboxes . The company said the upgrades need to be carried out after an independent consultant’s assessment found the letterboxes no longer met fire regulations. Residents said they had been told that while the letterboxes themselves cost between £50 and £90 it would take a day to fit just two - bumping up the price with labour costs. Jephson said the quote was simply a 'ballpark' figure and there was no deadline for residents to carry out the improvements. A spokeswoman said: 'As the residents own their flats within the scheme, they are responsible for these properties. 'Their obligations, which include ensuring their homes comply with fire regulations, are included in their lease agreement. Housing association Jephson said upgrades needed to be carried out after an independent consultant's assessment found the letterboxes no longer meet fire regulations . 'The safety of residents is of paramount importance to us and we have a duty of care to those living in the buildings we manage. 'We have therefore advised people living at Sweetbriar House to carry out this work in accordance with their lease agreement to eliminate what has been independently identified as an area for concern. 'If they choose not to, there is the risk that - in the event of a fire - someone may be injured or even killed. 'At the request of some of the residents, we asked an independent contractor to provide a quote for this work. Residents are under no obligation to use this contractor.'","Residents at Sweetbriar House in Gloucestershire told to replace letterboxes .

"By . Julian Robinson . A City banker and his wife have appeared in court to fight a fine for withdrawing their son from school to attend a memorial service. James Haymore, 34, and his wife Dana Haymore, 32, are accused of failing to ensure the regular attendance of their 11-year-old son, Toby, at Chancellor Park primary school in Chelmsford, Essex. The couple argue their son’s unauthorised absence came about as the family had been attending a memorial service for Toby’s great grandfather in America. James Haymore and his wife Dana, pictured arriving at court, are embarking on a test case to argue that a ban on taking children out of school during term time breaches their human rights . Mr Haymore, an account manager at global financial services firm JP Morgan, appeared alongside his wife at Colchester Magistrates’ Court for a brief hearing today where they both denied the charge. The couple could face a fine of up to £1,000 if found guilty of the offence. Today, Natasha Taylor, prosecuting, told the court: 'Toby Haymore is a Year Six pupil of compulsory school age. 'Between November 4 last year and March 21 this year he attended school on 146 occasions out of a possible 168. 'This represents an attendance rate of 87 percent. James Haymore and wife Dana are set for a two-day trial at Colchester Magistrates' Court, pictured, on October 10 . 'Part of these absences were related to unauthorised term time holiday.' The court heard the couple, who live with their three children in Chelmsford, Essex, will argue the £120 fine breaks their Article 8 right to a family life under the European Convention of Human Rights. The two-day trial is due to be heard at Colchester Magistrates’ Court on October 10. Former education secretary Michael Gove played a key part in tightening school absence rules. Since September last year absences in term time can only be authorised in ‘exceptional circumstances’. The Government has insisted that its reforms to deal with school absence are starting to have an effect (file picture) Parents of children aged five to 16 are legally responsible for ensuring they attend school regularly - unless they are home educated. Headteachers, social workers or police can issue parents penalty notices of up to £120 if a child regularly misses school, and their parents have not taken action or asked for help. If this is not paid, a prosecution will follow - and this can lead to a fine of up to £2,500, a three-month jail term or a community sentence. Council officials say that, aside from their education suffering, children who are often absent find it harder to sustain friendships, and are more likely to get involved with crime. Various options are available to headteachers, social workers or police including issuing parents with penalty notices between £60 and £120 if parents have not taken action or asked for help. If this is not paid, a prosecution will follow - and this can lead to a fine of up to £2,500, a three-month jail term or a community sentence. The Government has insisted that its reforms to deal with school absence are starting to have an effect. Under the changes, truancy fines have risen from £50 to £60, and from £100 to £120 if they are not paid within 28 days. Guidance on school holidays has also changed, with headteachers now only granting permission for term time trips in 'exceptional circumstances'. Earlier this year, Sally Randall, 35, landed herself with a criminal record after taking her son to Majorca during term-time to say goodbye to his dying grandfather. She pleaded guilty to a truancy charge when she appeared at Blackburn Magistrates’ Court, Lancashire. In February Nicola Duke was one of three parents prosecuted for failing to ensure their child attends Furness Academy in Barrow, Cumbria, and was fined £500 along with £120 of other costs. And in May, a 10-year-old girl was refused time off from Hansbury Farm Primary School, Tamworth to attend her grandfather's funeral - because the reasons for her absence did not amount to 'exceptional circumstances'. Gaynor Hodge, 39, and her husband Leigh, 41, sent in a leave of absence form asking for their daughter Demi to be allowed two days off during term time so she could attend the service.

"By . Julian Robinson . WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has lost a legal bid to have an arrest warrant issued in Sweden against him cancelled. A judge in Stockholm decided to uphold the warrant against him for alleged sexual offences against two women. The decision by Judge Lena Egelin dashes hopes of a breakthrough in the Australian’s case. Scroll down for video . Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, pictured, has lost a legal battle as he fights extradition to Sweden . He has been living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for more than two years as part of his bid to avoid extradition to Sweden. He believes that if he travels to Sweden, he will be sent on to the United States for questioning over the activities of the whistleblowing organisation. His Swedish lawyer said he will appeal against today’s decision. A court order to cancel the warrant would have been a step towards enabling the 43-year-old Australian to leave the London embassy. Julian Assange's lawyers Tomas Olsson, left, and Per E. Samuelsson talk to media ahead of the public court hearing in Stockholm today . Supporters of Mr Assange gathered outside the embassy in London’s Knightsbridge area, holding up banners calling for him to be freed. His lawyers lodged legal papers in Sweden last month shortly after the second anniversary of his dramatic arrival at the London embassy. He has been granted political asylum by Ecuador, but faces arrest the moment he steps outside the building. Police officers have been stationed outside the embassy since he arrived there. Police have been stationed outside the Ecuadorian embassy in London at a cost to the taxpayer of £6million . In April it was revealed that guarding the Ecuadorian embassy in London where Julian Assange has claimed asylum had cost taxpayers almost £6million. Metropolitan Police officers have been standing outside the Knightsbridge building since the WikiLeaks founder took refuge there in June 2012 - a vigil costing £11,000 per day. For more than two years he has lived in the embassy because he fears he will be extradited to America after he enraged the White House by releasing thousands of its secrets in 2010. At all times there are three Scotland Yard officers waiting outside the embassy to arrest him. At least one stands on the steps and others will question visitors leaving in case it is Assange in disguise. The cost of this up to April this year was £5.9million, including £1million in overtime costs. At the time Baroness Jenny Jones, deputy chair of the Police and Crime Committee condemnded the huge cost as 'ludicrous'. He has endured a self-imposed imprisonment in a single room after being given diplomatic asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London’s Knightsbridge. The embassy — strewn with red, yellow and blue Ecuadorian flags — takes up a single floor of an imposing block behind Harrods. Initially, Assange slept on an inflatable mattress donated by embassy staff, who are described as having become ‘like family’ to him. But when it became clear his stay was not going to be temporary, a small room was transformed into his living quarters and a bed installed. He is thought to have stood in direct sunlight for only about 20 minutes during his incarceration, when he emerged on the balcony to address his supporters in August 2012. He has a specially adapted lamp to mimic sunlight in his room — which measures just 15ft by 13ft. Near a Victorian fireplace he has a treadmill donated by the Left-wing film-maker Ken Loach and in his first year at the embassy he notched up 744 miles on the running machine. Revealing the £5.9million cost in a Freedom of Information request, Scotland Yard said the costs included £1million in overtime costs. In a meeting last month with reporters at the embassy to mark his second year of hiding, Assange said he had no intention of going to Sweden. He claimed this was because he has no guarantees he would not subsequently be sent to the United States. Officials there are maintaining their investigation into WikiLeaks' dissemination of hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents.","WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has lost key legal bid over arrest warrant .

"By . Julian Robinson . A British citizen has today been sentenced to more than 12 years for terror offences. Babar Ahmad, of Tooting, West London, admitted supporting terrorists in Afghanistan through websites that backed jihad. U.S. judge Janet Hall said he had helped enable Osama bin Laden to be protected when he was plotting the September 11 attacks by supporting the Taliban. Babar Ahmad, pictured, has been sentended to 12 years in prison by a judge who said he supported the Taliban regime in Afghanistan . But she said Ahmad had no knowledge of the plot and there was no evidence he supported bin Laden's al-Qaida terrorist group. The judge said: 'You can't walk away from the fact that what you were doing was enabling bin Laden to be protected in Afghanistan and to train the men who actually boarded the flights that drove into the Pentagon and World Trade Center.' But she imposed a much lower sentence than the 25 years sought by prosecutors, rejecting their claim that he posed a high risk of re-offending. The sentence will include the ten years Ahmad has already has served, she said. She also rejected testimony from a government cooperating witness that Ahmad had traveled to Afghanistan. Babar Ahmad's co-defendant, Syed Talha Ahsan, pictured, is also due to be sentenced and could face up to 15 years in prison . The case did not involve participation in acts of terrorism, and Ahmad showed no interest in doing so even after receiving a document detailing the movements and vulnerabilities of a U.S. Navy battle group, the court, in New Haven, Connecticut heard. Ahmad pleaded guilty in December to supporting terrorists through websites that sought to raise cash, recruit fighters and solicit items such as gas masks for the Taliban. Ahmad's attorney has said he publicly condemned the September 11 attacks and deeply regrets his support for the Taliban. Ahmad says he tried to help Muslims under attack in Bosnia and Chechnya, recalling atrocities he learned about while in Bosnia. Hall and a prosecutor said his support for the Taliban continued after the September 11 attacks. Ahmad told the judge he supported the Taliban because it was under attack, not because he supported bin Laden or Al-Qaida. He said he has read books about pacifist leader Mohandas K. Gandhi, also known as Mahatma Gandhi, and others while in prison and said talks can resolve differences. 'Not every conflict in the world is Bosnia,' said Ahmed, who was extradited to the U.S. in 2012 after an eight year legal battle. He added: 'The world is complicated.' A co-defendant, Syed Talha Ahsan, was due to be sentenced later on Wednesday. He faces up to 15 years in prison. The two men, who were extradited from Britain in 2012, faced charges in Connecticut because authorities said they used an Internet service provider in the state to run one of the websites.","Babar Ahmad sentenced to more than 12 years for supporting Taliban .

"By . Jenny Awford . It may be the height of the summer with millions of Britons enjoying well-deserved breaks in the sun. But big-name retailers have decided that it's the ideal time to start putting Christmas cards on the shelves. Clintons is just one high street name that decided to get the countdown to festive period under way at the start of this month - just as the country was basking in a heat wave. Scroll down for video . Christmas cards on sale in the Clintons store in Touchwood shopping centre in Solihull. It is one of the first high street stores to get into the festive spirit . The large display of Christmas cards at Clintons in Solihull has attracted a lot of attention from shoppers, with customers spending £100 a week . While the UK's recent battering by Hurricane Bertha may have brought an unwelcome reminder of autumnal chills, shoppers could still be forgiven for thinking Christmas has come a little early. At the card retailer's store in the Touchwood shopping centre in Solihull, West Midlands, the move has clearly struck a chord with some buyers. Assistant store manager Latoya Woodburn said customers had been spending up to £100 a week in the fortnight since the shop's 8ft (2.4m) sale display had gone up. Cards are not the only festive-themed wares, with winter wonderland wrapping paper and tree decorations, some featuring Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer also up for grabs. An employee at Selfridges in London checking the festive display which was unveiled on August 4 . Ms Woodburn said some customers had told staff it was too early, but the till receipts showed there was clearly a market despite December 25 being nearly four months away. The Harvester Bybrook Barn restaurant in Ashford, Kent, put up a Christmas tree four months early and were forced to take it down after complaints . She said: 'It's caused some reaction, but the sales are coming through the tills. 'People are coming in on a normal shop and just picking up a few Christmas cards at the same time. 'We do have some customers saying it's a bit too early, but we just smile and say 'Merry Christmas' - it's best to be prepared.' Shoppers were divided on whether it was still too soon to be thinking about sending season's greetings. Michelle Walker, from Solihull, said: 'It does seem a bit soon, but if you're trying to keep your finances on track and spread the cost throughout the year, it's probably a good thing, . 'We haven't even got summer out of the way yet though - it's a bit difficult to understand, but then I suppose people want different things.' Selfridges has already opened its Christmas store – with 134 shopping days left to buy all the celebration's essentials. The department store proudly claims to be the first in the world to launch its Christmas shop, with the North Pole-themed space set to welcome shoppers dressed in sunglasses and shorts. More than 700 sq ft of space on the fourth floor of the London flagship has been decked out with 100,000 festive decorations . It is expected to appeal mainly to tourists wanting to take home a memento. A pub was forced to take down a Christmas tree last week after a backlash from customers. Manager Mike Robinson got into the festive spirit by putting up a 12ft tree at the Harvester Bybrook Barn restaurant in Ashford, Kent - despite there still being 140 days to go. But Mr Robinson, who erected the tree to coincide with a Christmas promotion, said he had now taken down the tree because the plan 'backfired'.","Clinton Cards in Solihull unveiled its festive display  four months early .

"By . Sara Malm . Jailed: Zafar Iqbal, 67, molested and groped three girls, all under the age of 14, in south London in the 1970s and 80s . The chief executive of a Muslim women’s association has been jailed for sexually abusing three young girls in south London in the 1970s and 80s. Zafar Iqbal, 67, molested and groped the girls, all under the age of 14, on several occasions, but the abuse only came to light in 2010. The attacks saw the charity chief take the young girls to addresses in Peckham where he would force his tongue into their mouths as he molested and groped them, a court heard. Iqbal, who set up the council-funded Southwark Muslim Women’s Association in 1979, has been sentenced to seven and a half years in jail after being found guilty of 25 counts of sexual abuse earlier this year. The charity aims to support women, children and the elderly in a range of activities, including learning English, and still lists Iqbal as the main contact on the Charity Commission website. His work included running a creche and educational and recreational programmes and it is believed his wife Abida also worked for the charity. As part of his work Iqbal was introduced to The Queen and rubbed shoulders with Deputy Prime Minister Harriet Harman. The sex attacks took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s and only ended when Iqbal got married and moved away. However the council only informed police in 2012 when the abuse allegations surfaced. Iqbal was arrested and interviewed by detectives from the Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command (SOECA) before being charged with 45 counts of indecent assault in August 2013. After a trial he was found guilty of twenty five charges of sexual abuse against his victims who were all under 14. He was jailed for seven and a half years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for his whole life after being sentenced at Woolwich Crown Court yesterday. Detective Constable Martin Sharp, of the SOECA, said: ‘I would like to take this opportunity to praise the three young women that Iqbal abused and highlight their courage in coming forwarding and reporting to the police Iqbal’s crimes. ‘The support they gave the investigating officers during this investigation was instrumental bringing Iqbal to justice today. Attacker: Zafar Iqbal founded the council-funded Southwark Muslim Women's Association in 1979, which today operated from a south London address, and is still listed as the contact for the charity . ‘Zafar Iqbal no doubt thought the passage of time meant that he had escaped justice for the appalling offences he committed against three small children. I hope that his conviction and sentence gives other victims of sexual abuse confidence to come forward.’ A Southwark Council spokesperson said: ‘He worked for the charity for a number of years. It helps Muslims with a range of things, including learning English. ‘We are appalled by this man’s actions and we are undertaking an urgent review of Southwark Muslim Women’s Association and its association with the council.’ The council informed police after allegations of Iqbal’s abuse surfaced in 2010, it added. The spokesman added: ‘Southwark Muslim Women’s Association is an independent organisation funded from many sources, including the council. The convictions are not related to activities on the premises of the organisation.’ The Met said it began investigations in late 2012 after one of Iqbal’s victims came forward. Previous allegations were anonymous and so the force was unable to pursue them. Rubbing shoulders: This blurry image shows convicted sex offender Iqbal meeting Harriet Harman in 2009 . In the financial year ending March 2013, the Southwark Muslim Women’s Association (SMWA) had an income of just under £386,000. Iqbal had been on sick leave from the charity during that year. In the annual report he wrote: ‘It has been a frustrating year for me personally. The SMWA has been part of my life for more than 30 years so to be away from work due to ill health has been very difficult.’ Just five years ago, Iqbal was feted for his ‘excellence in education’ at The Muslim News Awards for Excellence. He was introduced to the Queen in 2010 as part of The City Bridge Trust’s 800th anniversary celebration. In 2009, Ms Harman, then Deputy Prime Minister, invited Iqbal and other members of the Association to the House of Commons where they were photographed together. Earlier this year Ms Harman was forced to express ‘regret’ over links between a paedophile group and the National Council of Civil Liberties when she was its legal officer in the 1970s and 1980s. The Paedophile Information Exchange was an affiliate of the NCCL while she, her husband, trade unionist Jack Dromey, and fellow Labour politician Patricia Hewitt held office there.","Zafar Iqbal, 67, guilty of 25 counts of historic sex abuse against three girls .

"By . Sara Malm . Tragedy: Lauren Walker, 13, died last October of a fatal gastric haemorrhage, which may have been preventable . A 13-year-old schoolgirl who died in her sleep could have been saved if she had undergone a routine brain scan, an inquest has heard. Lauren Walker, of Richmond, Sheffield, was rushed to hospital with severe headache and slurred speech, but her condition was treated as a migraine. Just weeks after the teenager had visited A&E at Sheffield Children’s Hospital, her parents found her dead in her bed last October. An inquest into her death heard that Lauren, a pupil at Sheffield’s City School, actually had hydrocephalus - a build-up of fluid on the brain - after being born with an undiagnosed defect which meant it was unable to drain away. A condition which could have been picked up with a CT or MRI scan and treated with surgery, pathologist Luiz Peres, who carried out a post-mortem examination, said. A Sheffield inquest heard that Lauren suffered a fatal gastric haemorrhage, possibly caused by a combination of painkillers to relieve her headaches and her brain condition, which caused some ulceration of her stomach lining. ‘We are all devastated by Lauren’s death, and would like to know if Lauren would still be here today if she’d had a brain scan. It makes it more difficult to deal with,’ Lauren’s father, Mark Walker, said in a statement. Lauren had complained about a headache on the night of her death, and her mother, Theresa Flint, had remained at her side until she fell asleep. Ms Flint told the inquest that when she checked on her daughter the following morning, she found her unresponsive. Mr Walker made several attempts to revive his daughter but it was too late. Three weeks earlier, Lauren complained of a headache and slurred speech, and an ambulance was called. Mr Walker told the inquest that he had spoken to Lauren’s mother, saying their daughter ‘needed a scan’. Avoidable: Lauren Walker's condition could have been picked up with a CT or MRI scan, but despite several medical professionals discussing the idea at Sheffield Children's Hospital, none was carried out . In addition, a trainee doctor and a consultant at Sheffield Children’s Hospital’s A&E that admitted the teenager both told the inquest they agreed a scan could have helped with diagnosis. Dr Katharine Nunn and Mr Chris Fitzsimmons, who worked in A&E on September 25, said they decided to admit her and referred her to the inpatient paediatric team. Both Dr Nunn and Mr Fitzsimmons said although they discussed the possibility of a scan, neither told the paediatric team of their thoughts. Mr Fitzsimmons, a consultant in paediatric emergency medicine, said: ‘My expectation was they probably would scan Lauren, but it was not my place to tell them to.’ He said he felt ‘comfortable they were doing the right thing’ referring the case on. Dr Nunn said she had considered a number of possible reasons for Lauren’s illness, including migraines, a brain tumour and trauma. Following a second episode of illness the inquest heard Lauren went to see her GP, Dr Ngozi Anumba, at Woodhouse Health Centre, on October 8. Dr Anumba said she was told by Lauren and her mum that the teen had been diagnosed with migraine, so prescribed migraine prevention medication. ‘My impression was it was a firm diagnosis,’ said the doctor. ‘Her mum told me Lauren had had all the tests, and they told me it was migraine. ‘I thought Lauren had had a scan - I didn’t know she had not had one. I didn’t get the impression there was any uncertainty about the diagnosis.’ Lauren’s mum, who sobbed as she described her daughter, said she was a member of a dance school and an athletics club, and ‘perfect’. She said: ‘She was doing well at school, she was athletic, she did lots of sports. She was a very kind, giving girl. She was just so kind, she had lots of friends.’ The inquest continues.","Lauren Walker, 13, died last October of a fatal gastric haemorrhage .

"By . Sara Malm . A man cut a tattoo of a former partner’s name off his own arm to prove to his girlfriend that he was faithful, a court has heard. Dominic Winner used a Stanley knife to remove the tattoo in front of his then girlfriend, whom he has been found guilty of subjecting to physical and emotional abuse. The 23-year-old from Hemlington, Middlesborough, was described as ‘violent, jealous, bullying and controlling’ to Teesside Crown Court on Friday. Violent: Dominic Winner, 23, subjected his then-girlfriend to physical and emotional abuse, Teesside Crown Court heard . Prosecutor Nigel Soppitt told the court how Winner’s then-girlfriend, who has not been named, suffered a perforated eardrum and had been threatened with a knife during the abusive relationship. According to Mr Soppitt, the pair got together last October, but just one month later, the arguments turned into physical abuse. Mr Soppit described how Winner had ‘pushed her around’, causing her pain and discomfort after blaming her when he missed a doctor’s appointment. He told the court the the couple's arguments got worse and he self-harmed in front of her, was jealous and controlling. Mr Soppitt said: ‘He took a Stanley knife and cut a tattoo of a former girlfriend’s name to prove he was faithful. ‘A few days later they argued about her use of her phone. He threatened to take her phone, her TV and clean out her bank account.’ Disturbing: Winner cut a tattoo of his former partner's name off his arm using a Stanley knife (file photo) As he swore and threatened her, Winner grabbed her right breast, and caused the skin to rip as he twisted it. She then fell and hit her head, suffering a perforated eardrum as a result. A few days after this incident, the woman told Winner would leave him, and he then pushed her against the bedroom wall and threw her on to the bed. Mr Soppitt added: ‘He was looking for his knife, and he told her that she deserved it.’ ‘He took a Stanley knife and cut a tattoo of a former girlfriend’s name to prove he was faithful' - Prosecutor Nigel Soppitt . After the third incident she finally report his assaults to the police and she was photographed covered with bruises. When Winner was interviewed by police he said: ‘She is making everything ten times worse.’ Winner has previous convictions for assaulting his mother in 2009 and for affray in 2010 when he approached a house in Hemlington with a knife. Mr Soppitt added: ‘The Crown say that the offences were in aggravated circumstances because they were repeated assaults on the same victim and, in the course of one assault, he said that he was looking for a knife,’ John Gillette, defending, said that Winner had been in custody for five months and he had re-established a relationship with the mother of his children, who had visited him in prison. He added: ‘There are still issues and attitudes to be addressed and he would very much appreciate assistance with that.’ The judge told Winner that because he had already served the equivalent of a ten-month sentence he would give him a suspended sentence which would allow him to be supervised. Winner was given a 16-month jail sentence suspended for two years with supervision and a Building Better Relationships programme after he pleaded guilty to two common assaults, an actual bodily harm assault and possession of a knife between November and January. The judge also imposed a restraining order for eight years banning Winner from contacting, causing harassment, alarm or distress to the girlfriend and two other women associated with her.","Dominic Winner subjected his partner to physical and emotional abuse .

"By . Chris Pleasance . and Sara Malm . Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn is suing the makers of a film allegedly loosely based on events in his life. Welcome To New York, which premiered in Cannes this weekend, stars Gerard Depardieu as sex-addict Mr Deveraux, whom, including other exploits, rapes a hotel maid. Strauss-Kahn's lawyer said today this makes the film defamatory, as the storyline is similar to the accusations the French statesman faced in a sexual assault case in 2011. Scroll down for video . Dominique Strauss-Kahn's lawyer said Welcome To New York is defamatory, as the storyline is similar to the accusations he faced in a sexual assault case in 2011 . A scene from the film Welcome to New York, which is loosely based on the rise and fall of former French presidential hopeful Dominique Strauss-Khan . The French . statesman was arrested in 2011 just as he was preparing a bid to become . the next French president, accused by Nafissatou Diallo, a New York . chamber maid, of trying to rape her. Lawyers . for Mr Strauss-Kahn proved that a sex act which took place was . consensual, but he was forced to step down from his $500,000 a-year job . at the International Monetary Fund. Diallo . then sued Mr Strauss-Kahn, but the two sides reached a financial . settlement late last year, the details of which have never been . disclosed. ‘This happened three years ago and he was cleared,’ lawyer Jean Veil told Europe 1 radio on Monday. ‘He is frightened, sickened (by the film). He has instructed his lawyers, myself, to make a complaint for defamation based on accusations of rape, on the insinuations made throughout this film.’ Welcome to New York (pictured), a film based on the sex scandal that engulfed Dominique Strauss-Khan in 2011, has premiered at Cannes . In the film Gerard Depardieu (left) plays Mr Deveraux a powerful sex-addict, thought to be based on Strauss-Khan (left) who was accused of sexually assaulting a chambermaid in a New York hotel . In the film, Mr Deveraux is seen taking part in several alcohol-fulled orgies involving prostitutes in a New York hotel room while on a business trip, before raping a hotel chambermaid as she comes to clean the room the next day. Deveraux is then arrested, given a full strip search captured in an unflinching single shot, before another harrowing flashback sequence shows him sexually assaulting a female journalist sent to interview him. The . two-hour film, which also stars Nip/Tuck actress Jacqueline Bisset as . the character Mr Deveraux’s wife, premiered at the festival on Saturday . with a private showing. The . film will not be shown in French cinemas but will be released on . video-on-demand websites. It will appear in cinemas in other countries . however, including the UK, at a later date. Before . the screening Depardieu , director Abel Ferrara and Jacqueline Bisset, . took to the stage of The Star cinema to introduce the film. Depardieu . said he 'disliked politicians' and was 'happy' to participate in the . film, while Mr Ferrara said Depardieu had not only agreed to act in the . film but also put up 'half the money'. Mr . Ferrara has defended himself against the accusations from Strauss-Khan, . saying he has artistic freedom and can choose his fictitious storylines . as he pleases. In the explicit film, Mr Deveraux is shown raping a chambermaid, also in a New York hotel . 'I’m not on trial,' Ferrara told Reuters TV in Cannes this weekend. 'I’m an artist, I have freedom of speech. I’m from America I’m from the country of the free, land of the free and home of the brave.' Since the premiere the film has received mixed reviews, with US actor Mickey Rourke saying it was Ferrara's best film in years. Rourke also praised Depardieu as having 'more courage than any other living actor today', according to Yahoo, while French director Claude Lelouch also hailed his performance. However, The Telegraph called the film 'superficial and pretentious', giving it just two stars out of five. Before the screening Vincent Maraval, producer of the film, said the French elite tried to block the  there is an ‘incestuous relationship between the media and political elite’ in France. He told the Independent: ‘No French TV station wanted to finance us. ‘Everyone warned us not to make this film, both our friends and our enemies.’","Welcome To New York 'based on the downfall of Mr Strauss-Khan'

Last Saturday night, Conchita’s Rise Like A Phoenix was awarded 290 points, ensuring that Eurovision 2015 will be held in the Austrian capital. More than 10,000 people gathered in front of the federal chancellery in Vienna, to celebrate the return of Conchita to the stage. Scroll down for video . The Phoenix: Austrian singer and Eurovision Song Contest winner Conchita Wurst performs on stage  in front of the federal chancellery in Vienna . Fandom: An estimated 10,000 people gathered to see Conchita return to the stage in Austria after her Eurovision win . Eventually, as more fake-bearded fans gathered in the square in front of Chancellor Werner Faymann's office, the space proved too small, forcing much of the crowd into a nearby park. Wurst said her Song Contest victory is ‘not for me, but for people who believe in a future with progress.’ In a meeting with Wurst, Chancellor Faymann, head of the Austrian government, praised her as a symbol for ‘tolerance, love and joy of life.’ Wurst, the alter ego of 25-year-old Thomas Neuwirth, triumphed over the 25 contestants in this year’s contest, including British singer Molly Smitten-Downes, who came 17th with just 40 points.

Prior to Eurovision, Wurst had faced a barrage of homophobic and transphobic attacks from within her own country and from other countries including Russia, Armenia and Belarus, who branded the contest a 'hotbed of sodomy', the BBC reported. 'I can only say thank you for your attention. If this is only about me and my person, I can live with it', Wurst previously said about her critics in emails. 'You know, I have a very thick skin. It's just strange that a little facial hair causes that much excitement.'

"By . Sara Malm . and John Hall . A series of love letters sent from one of the first soldiers to die during the Battle of the Somme to his fiancee have been found in a dusty attic. Private Frederick Bertram Key served with the 1/8th Battalion of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment as part of the ‘pals battalions’ between 1914 to 1916. He was killed at the age of 27 while fighting the German Empire during the bloody battle of the Somme, in France on July 1st, 1916 - the day the conflict began. 'My Darling Zen,' writes Private Frederick Key in a letter dated 16th May 1915 which has been found in an attic in a house in Hampshire along with 41  other letters and 15 post cards sent to Zen during his time serving in the British Army during World War I . Love letters: An undated photograph of Zen Hall, from Clifton-on-Teme, Worcestershire as part of her correspondence with her fiance Frederick Key who died on the first day of the battle of the Somme . During his time fighting World War I with the British Army he penned a series of moving letters to his wife-to-be Zen Hall from the front line. In the hand-written notes he speaks of his hopes of returning to start their married life together to ‘live in a state of bread and cheese and kisses.’ He outlines his dreams of them owning a house in the English countryside with a nice garden where they ‘could take tea in the summer’ and tells her ‘it is sure to turn out well in the end.’ Tragically, in his last letter written just five months before his death he resigns himself to his fate ‘whatever that may be’ but reassures Zen if he dies ‘you will find me waiting for you in spirit’. He signs off the final letter to his sweetheart declaring: ‘I love you my own sweet darling, with every fibre of my being, I just love you.’ Rearing to go: The 2nd Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment prepare to leave Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands in July 1915, the same regiment that Pvt. Fred Key served in . Separated: A 'Forget me not' card, which Fred Key sent to his fiance in November 1915 . Letters of hope: Private Key would write to his fiancee about the happy life they would lead together in a house in the countryside where they would 'take tea in the summer' once he was back from war . The remarkable letters were uncovered by a family in the attic of a house in Hampshire who are now selling them at auction in the centenary year of the start of WW1. The series of 42 letters and 15 autographed postcards are expected to fetch between £500 and £800 when they go under the hammer on May 16. Chris Albury, senior valuer and auctioneer at Dominic Winter Auctions, said: ‘Any letters from the front line are especially moving but these are so poignant. ‘You are clearly caught up in a beautiful love story, which ends tragically on the first day of the Battle of the Somme. ‘He remains aware of his own mortality and tackles the horror of war head on, while speaking about his hopes for their future. It really is heartbreaking. ‘It really is a case of being there by the grace of God and is a sobering reminder of what people sacrificed so we can live as we do now in Britain during 2014’ Pte Key, from Lichfield, Staffordshire had joined up along with his friends as one of the tragic ‘pals battalions’ sponsored by Dunlop - the company he worked for at the time. The pals battalions were specially constituted battalions comprising men who had enlisted together in local recruiting drives, with the promise that they would be able to serve alongside their friends, neighbours and work colleagues. Nine of the letters were sent to his beloved Zen while on training exercises in Essex between November 7, 1914 and March 21, 1915. The rest were sent from the front line ‘somewhere in France’ as Pte Key and his friends battled the German war machine. The letters begin in a light hearted . manner, describing the first experiences of battle, but soon outline the . true horror of the conflict. On one occasion he wrote: ‘Many a time I have to clench myself to keep from running away into shelter.’ Treasured words: One of the later letters, in a series of heartbreaking love notes sent to Zen from Fred Key on the front line during World War I in 1916 . Nine of the letters were sent to Zen while on training exercises in Essex between November 7 1914 and March 21 1915, and the rest were sent from the front line 'somewhere in France' 'Just off to the trenches': The series of 42 letters and 15 autographed postcards are expected to fetch between £500 and £800 at auction . Writing in April 1915 he also describes having to duck for cover as the German's began to bombard the British trenches. He said: ‘At 3 o'clock the Germans started to shell us, and hit the trench that I was in about 15 times. ‘So you bet that when they were doing that I began to fancy that I should never write it at all. ‘The trenches around here are on ground that is full of dead, and when there is any digging on it stinks something dreadfully. ‘You are not to worry about anything, it is sure to turn out well in the end and then D.V. we must have some good times together.’ While hopeful for the future each letter is sprinkled with the abbreviation DV, short for Deo volente, the latin for God Willing. Talking of his future with Zen he added on August 29, 1915: ‘What a happy day that will be when we have a home of our own, I suppose that you would live with me in a state of bread and cheese and kisses, but not until I can afford to keep you. ‘No I won't say that, when we can live together in a style that at least you are used to, but I shall if I can manage it live in the country, it is much cheaper as regards rent etc. and a nice motor cycle & sidecar for us to take some enjoyable runs together and which I can go to business on. ‘How does that strike you, with a nice front garden and a big one at the back, with a lawn where could take tea in the Summer. ‘Well I only hope D.V. that all will come true.’ As the months of war stretched on Fred's thought of survival increasingly involved the prayers of those back home. In . January 1916 he wrote: ‘I am sure that if I do get out of this business . safely, it will be mainly due to your and others applications to . Providence for my safety. 'Cause . although I do say my prayers as a rule regularly , I am sorry to say . that it is only when I am near or in the trenches, 'cause spiritually . & physically I am a coward, I shirk from bodily pain and many a time . I have to clench myself to keep from running away into shelter.’ Tragic end: Pvt Key died as the 14th Royal Warwicks, pictured during the Battle of Guillemont, led the first charges of the Somme on July 1st, 1916 with the 1/8th battalion virtually wiped out in one go . Total heartbreak: Zen Hall's diary entry which reads 'My darling was mortally wounded by a machine gun bullet in 3rd German line. I didn't know until the 8th' Pvt Key died as his regiment led the first charges of the Somme on July 1st, 1916. Just after 7.30am over 600 men went over the top to be mown down by enemy gunfire with the 1/8th virtually wiped out in one go. Fred's final heart wrenching letter in February 1916 writes of being parted from Zen and says: ‘Yes it is very nice to know that now I have met you, you will never be parted from me, except perhaps for a few short years. ‘I mean to say that when we are both defunct we have the satisfaction of knowing that we shall know and love one another more than ever and shall never be parted again, that is one of the things that make me resigned to my fate whatever it may be. ‘The parting would no doubt be long for you but very short to me, and you will find me waiting for you in spirit, still I hope that we shall live together on this earth many years yet, and that when the parting does come, it will be very short; I love you my own sweet darling, with every fibre of my being, I just love you.’ Along with the letters are two pencil sketches of a young woman, believed to be of Zen and her notebook, detailing their final meeting in December 1915. Slipped inside that book is a telegram informing the family of Fred's death, retrospectively Zen wrote: ‘July 1st 1916. My darling was mortally wounded by a machine gun bullet in 3rd German line & I didn't know until the 8th’ On July 10 she adds ‘Letter came saying my darling killed....went to Lichfield’. Following the tragic news she added: ‘And that is the last time I shall see him on this earth’.

"By . Sara Malm . It is the curse of modern train travel – the passenger with the loud voice and mobile phone who’s oblivious to the sign that says ‘quiet carriage’. On this occasion, however, it wasn’t just any passenger. It was Jamie Laing, millionaire heir to the McVitie’s biscuit empire and reality TV star. Perhaps he thought the railway bylaws did not apply to him. But the train guard and the British Transport Police did not share his view and the Made in Chelsea star  was arrested before he’d even finished his journey. Done in Peterborough: Made in Chelsea star Jamie Laing, 25, pictured during a promotional bungee jump this weekend, was arrested on a train from Leeds to London after refusing to turn his phone off . The drama unfolded after Laing boarded . the ‘quiet coach’ of the 3.05pm Leeds to London service on Sunday and . proceeded to use his mobile phone, ignoring staff’s repeated requests to . stop. So persistent was . the 25-year-old’s ‘unacceptable behaviour’ that staff alerted British . Transport Police, who boarded the train when it pulled into Peterborough . station. The millionaire . was arrested after he refused to give his details and was taken to a . nearby police station for questioning before being allowed to continue . his journey to London. When . he finally arrived at King’s Cross, he accepted a police caution for . ‘failing to give his details after committing a railway bylaw offence of . unacceptable behaviour’. No silent mode: The TV star and heir to McVities was interviewed at a police station in Peterborough and later received a caution for 'unacceptable behaviour' upon his arrival in London . Laing . – along with two full  and four half-siblings – is expected to inherit a . fortune from the  biscuit giant, which is worth  several billion . pounds. Following his . arrest, Laing, whose own confectionery range is stocked by Harvey . Nichols, tweeted on Monday: ‘Yesterday was up there with one of the . worst I’ve had, but you can only appreciate the good when you’ve . experienced the bad.’  The former student at Radley College, where fees . are more than £10,000 a term, had travelled to Leeds for a guest . appearance at Halo night club with Made in Chelsea co-star and diamond . mining heir Francis Boulle. Fellow . passenger Mario Shacailis, who witnessed the arrest, said: ‘I saw Jamie . being marched across the platform with two officers at his side. He . looked a bit tired.’ Other train users took to Twitter after witnessing the incident. Jack Macfarlane posted: ‘Just seen @JamieLaing_UK get arrested at Peterborough station hahaha chin up mate.’ Tom . Harris tweeted: ‘Fairly sure I just saw @JamieLaing_UK getting arrested . at Peterborough station, probably the weirdest thing I’ve seen today.’ The . quiet coaches on East Coast trains are for passengers who want a ‘more . peaceful journey’. Those who choose that carriage are expected to switch . their mobile phones to silent, keep noise to a minimum, use headphones . to listen to music, talk quietly and take calls only in designated . vestibules. Jamie Laing posted this image on his Instagram in the early hours of Sunday, featuring former Made in Chelsea star Francis Boulle and DJ Shy FX, captioned 'Couldn't be more in love with this guy, absolute legend' A statement from . the British Transport Police said: ‘Officers from BTP arrested a . 25-year-old man from Chelsea, London, for failing to give his details . after committing a railway bylaw offence of unacceptable behaviour on . board the 1505hrs Leeds to London King’s Cross service on Sunday, May . 18. ‘The man was taken off the  train by officers and taken to a police station in Peterborough to be interviewed. ‘He . then supplied officers with his details, was released and received  a . caution for the offence when  he arrived at London King’s  Cross . station.’ Passengers can be fined up to £1,000 for the offence. Laing has not responded  to requests for comment on  the incident. He . rose to fame as the playboy star of Channel 4’s reality show Made in . Chelsea, which is now in its seventh series and attracts audiences of . around 850,000. His great-great-grandfather Sir Alexander Grant was credited with inventing the Jaffa Cake, digestive and rich tea biscuits. Laing also runs his own business, Candy Kittens, where glamorous staff members sell a variety of sweets and clothing. He has been reported as saying his goal is to become ‘the Willy Wonka or Hugh Hefner of Chelsea’.","Made in Chelsea star arrested on train from Leeds to London .

The adventurous dog, called Bullseye, made his way onto the number 22 bus in Brighton, East Sussex, after the driver stopped to let on a crowd of passengers. It was not until the crowded bus reached its destination at Imperial Arcade that people onboard realised the animal was alone. A lost bulldog travelled almost two miles on a city bus route before passengers realised it had no owner on board.  Adventurous Bullseye sneaked onto the number 22 bus in Brighton, East Sussex . The bus stop at the top of Elm Grove by Brighton General Hospital where the British Bulldog dog caught the number 22 on his own . Bus driver Steve Weir was left looking after Bullseye until a dog warden from Brighton and Hove City Council came to rescue him. With no microchip, the was taken to a vets in Patcham near Brighton, East Sussex, where he was found to be in perfect health. And a short while later Bullseye, who shares his name with the dog in Charles Dickens’ Oliver, was reunited with his relieved owners. A member of the public stumbled across a group of children looking for a bulldog in Queen’s Park, Brighton, and informed them of Bullseye’s whereabouts. Bullseye was finally reunited with his family Scott Maynard and Terrie Nott, and their sons Jake, 10, and Jimmy, 3 . The dog's owner - father-of-two Scott Maynard, from Brighton - said: 'I went outside to talk to a neighbour and Bullseye must have escaped. 'It was raining and he hates that so he must have run round the corner and maybe got on the bus to shelter. 'My two boys were devastated when he went and we’re so glad to have him back. It sounds like he had quite an adventure.' Bullseye was reunited with Scott, his partner Terrie Nott and their boys Jimmy, three, and Jake, ten. Jake’s friends were searching Queen’s Park when they asked the member of the public if he had seen the dog who then helped to reunite them. It was not until the busy bus reached its destination at Imperial Arcade that people onboard realised the animal was alone . A spokeswoman for Brighton and Hove Bus Company said the company was delighted Bullseye’s owners had been found. They added he would be welcomed back onboard anytime, with an offer of free tickets for life. A spokeswoman for the company said: 'The bus was taken out of service and all the passengers had to be taken off. 'The driver then stayed with the dog for more than an hour while the warden was called. 'Steve said he was a lovely dog and wanted to thank all the passengers for their help in holding on to him as he wasn’t wearing a collar.'","Bullseye made his way onto the number 22 bus in Brighton, East Sussex .

There are four midfielders, four forwards and two defenders who make the list - with a combined total value of £83.6million, meaning you could put together a decent proportion of your squad with some of most popular picks. Fancy yourself as Louis van Gaal? Then join MailOnline's Fantasy Football game before the opening match . CLICK HERE for the ultimate guide of how to play MailOnline's Fantasy Football game. 10) Raheem Sterling (Liverpool, £9.8m) - Appears in 22.31% of teams . The England winger is lightning quick and extremely strong for his size, but most importantly he is a threat going forward. A return of nine goals and five assists last season is likely to be improved again this year, so he is a good choice for your side. Young star: Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling costs £9.8m in MailOnline's Fantasy Football game . Popular: Raheem Sterling is 10th on the list - he netted nine goals for Liverpool last season and got five assists . 9) Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal, £10.5m) - 22.50% . Many people are labelling Sanchez as the star who can finally turn Arsenal back into serious title contenders, and his record is impressive. In a wider role for Barcelona last season he scored 19 goals and contributed 10 assists - as the main man at Arsenal, who knows how impressive those figures could become. New arrival: Alexis Sanchez signed for Arsenal from Barcelona this summer and can excite the league . Dangerous: Sanchez (left) scored 19 goals and contributed 10 assists in La Liga for Barcelona last year . 8) Matty Taylor (Burnley, £3.2m) - 22.95% . Taylor's presence in the top 10 may surprise many but he is a bargain at £3.2m for a player who is likely to play week-in, week-out which itself brings points. He did not bag any goals or assists as a bit-part player for West Ham United last season, but as a man to put on the bench he is likely to accrue a few points if you are seriously struggling with injuries and suspensions. Super sub: Burnley's Matty Taylor is cheap and he offers a great option off the bench on Fantasy Football . 7) Leighton Baines (Everton, £6.5m) - 24.15% . No surprise at all to see Baines on this list as he is a one of those rare commodities - a defender who scores goal. The left-back takes penalties and free-kicks, meaning he contributed five goals and four assists last season. Everton keep a lot of clean sheets as well, so there's extra points in the bag. Essential: Leighton Baines is a must-have for any good Fantasy side because he scores from defence . 6) Diego Costa (Chelsea, £11.0m) - 24.17% . Chelsea's new signing excelled at Atletico Madrid last season, scoring 27 goals as he led the underdogs to the La Liga title. He is big, powerful and links up well with defenders - he will lead Chelsea's attack and is bound to pick up points as they focal point up front they have been so severely lacking. Prolific: Chelsea's Diego Costa scored 27 goals in La Liga for champions Atletico Madrid last season . 5) Dejan Lovren (Liverpool, £5.2m) - 27.19% . The Croat finally completed his move from Southampton to Liverpool this summer after a protracted transfer, and it is easy to see why they wanted him . Two Man of the Match awards last season, two tackles per games, 2.7 interceptions per game and eight clearances all add up to an impressive defensive rating. Seven yellow cards is a slight blot on the copybook, though he is a centre-back after all. Stalwart: Liverpool's Dejan Lovren was extremely solid at the back for Southampton last season . 4) Aaron Ramsey (Arsenal, £9.6m) - 28.26% . The 23-year-old had the season of his life last year - before injury cruelly curtailed it - and he netted an amazing 10 goals from midfield in 23 appearances. Ramsey also added eight assists, three Man of the Match award and was booked just three times - if he stays fit he seems a perfect choice. Form: Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey had the season of his life last season before getting injured . Useful: As a midfielder who scores goals - 10 last season - and contributes assists Ramsey is a good buy . 3) Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool, £10.4m) - 31.36% . The Liverpool forward is just above Rooney in the price-range for strikers and, after really coming of age last season, he can blossom this campaign as Brendan Rodgers' main man following the departure of Luis Suarez to Barcelona. He scored an incredible 21 goals - and added seven assists - in just 26 starts last season in the Premier League. If he can stay fit and Liverpool have another good season he will bag you points for fun. Main man: Daniel Sturridge is now top dog at Liverpool after Luis Suarez's move to Barcelona this summer . Good return: Sturridge contributed 21 goals and seven assists as Liverpool finished second last season . 2) Wayne Rooney (Manchester United, £10.3m) - 32.45% . The new Manchester United captain was always likely to feature on this list, and it is no surprise to see him nestled up in second place. A price-tag of £10.3m seems good value for a player who scored 17 goals and added 10 assists last season. He is the sixth most expensive striker, yet he has scored 83 Premier League goals in the last four seasons for United. Yes, his eight bookings last season means he drops a point here and there for his ill-discipline, but he also won seven Man of the Match awards and would be a great option as captain. Captain material: New Manchester United skipper Wayne Rooney has made his way on to second on the list . Red Devil: A return of 17 goals and 10 assists last season means Rooney is bound to bring in the points . 1) Ross Barkley (Everton, £7.1m) - 32.77% . Everton and England's midfield sensation is a somewhat surprising name to be the most popular pick - although his price makes him a very attractive proposition. The 20-year-old started 25 league games for Everton last season, and came off the bench on another nine occasions, scoring six goals in the process. He averages an impressive 2.3 shots per game for a midfielder, although with five bookings his disciplinary record is a minor concern. Barkley is likely to mature further this season and become a key part of Roberto Martinez's side, allowing him to accrue an even greater number of points. At just £7.1m he appears a snippet and that's why a third of all teams have selected him. Coming of age: Everton's Ross Barkley is a dangerous midfielder who can score goals and contribute assists . Number one: Ross Barkley of Everton is the most-picked player in this season's MailOnline Fantasy Football .","There are no Manchester City players in the top 10, but Burnley feature .
Six Englishman, a Welshman, Spaniard, a Chilean and a Croat appear .
The most-picked player has been chosen by 32.77% of all managers .
There are four midfielders, four forwards and two defenders totalling £83.6m ."

Adam Crafton: Emotional moment for Darren Fletcher. After celebrating with his team-mates, he raised his arms to the Stretford End and showed his gratitude.

Valencia have looked threatening on the counter-attack, but Jone and Smalling have coped well. Matt Barlow: Real Sociedad have flickered into life since going two down. Chelsea may have eased off a bit. Suddenly it has the air of… well, a pre-season friendly, after an intense opening eight minutes. The rain has stopped and Mourinho has emerged from the tunnel, where he was sheltering to prowl the touchline. His team are still 2-0 up. Adam Crafton: Not the most inspiring of beginning to the Louis van Gaal era at Old Trafford but one majestic pass from Ander Herrera has lit up Old Trafford. Driven with the laces across the field and a super cross from Young. Not sure about the fall from Rooney. Unlucky with the penalty, as it cannons off the post. Almost hit it too well.

Reports in Spain on Saturday claimed Falcao is on the verge of signing for the Champions League winners on an initial £10million year-long loan. And Jardim was anything but convincing with his response when he was asked about keeping Falcao at the principality club. Quality: Monaco striker Radamel Falcao has been linked with a £10m year-long loan move to Real Madrid . Jardim told French paper L'Equipe: 'For now, he is a Monaco player and I am counting on him.' Falcao, who moved to Monaco from Real's bitter rivals Atletico Madrid for £47.5m last summer, has been out injured since January after damaging knee ligaments and he missed Colombia's journey to the quarter-finals of the World Cup. Yet he is set to make his return to action in the Emirates Cup against Valencia - and he would then play either Arsenal or Benfica, depending on how the teams progress - over the weekend of August 2-3. 'I think he will be able to start playing again at the Emirates Cup. He is now in the final phase of his recuperation,' Jardim said.

The England legend says 'cricket has changed for the better' over the last 20 years. And he'd know - he has witnessed first-hand how the sport has evolved. From Hawk-Eye to Snicko, HotSpot to the batsman's wagonwheel - the presentation of cricket has been changing constantly during the former England captain's time at Sky Sports. VIDEO Scroll down to watch reaction to England's Test victory from Cook and Anderson . Looking on: Sky Sports pundits David Gower (right) and Ian Botham (left) look on during the Test . Behind the scenes: Cricket coverage on Sky Sports requires the use of more than 30 cameras and 80 staff . Pundits: Botham (centre) with Michael Atherton (right) and Nasser Hussian in the Sky Sports commentary box . As close as it gets: The players are often not happy with how invasive the cameramen can be at a match . Gadgets: Sky has introduced new innovations and technologies over the years, including the mobile Sky Pad . Victory: England beat India by 266 runs at the Ageas Bowl in the third Test to level the series at 1-1 . Joy: James Anderson (right) jumps after claiming a wicket during the match at the Ageas Bowl . At last: England captain Alastair Cook could celebrate his side's first win in 11 Test matches on Thursday . As England were marching headlong toward their first Test victory in 11 matches against India at the Ageas Bowl, an 80-strong team were buzzing around behind the scenes as Gower chatted on air. Crowds may have been disappointing for large parts of the third Test in Hampshire – with just 4,784 spectators in attendance on the fourth day – but the viewers at home were still tuning into the action on Sky Sports in their droves. Since Sky first broadcast cricket in 1990, when they covered England’s overseas tour of the West Indies, innovations to enhance the viewer's experience have come thick and fast. Cricket fans do not just watch a bowler running in and a batsman slapping the ball through extra cover any more – they can listen to the on-field reaction thanks to stump microphones, see how a spinner has managed to get so many revolutions on the ball with hi-motion replays and find out if an opener has nicked the ball through Hot Spot analysis. The Sky Sports punditry team includes six former England captains, several Wisden cricketers of the year and World Cup winners. Between them they have: . The commentary team includes: . Central figure: Gower anchors Sky Sports' coverage of England's international cricket both home and away . On screen: England players form a huddle in the middle of the Ageas Bowl pitch while a cameraman films them . Test: Sky Sports pundit Michael Atherton (left) talks with Alastair Cook (centre) as MS Dhoni (right) looks on . Innovations: Michael Holding (left) and Ian Ward talk through issues on Sky Sports Zone during the third Test . Sky Sports cover a range of different cricket matches including international Tests, ODIs and Twenty20s, as well as county matches. For just one cricket match, here is what is needed: . The public face of the operation are the star-studded pundits who boast 769 Tests, 33,440 runs and 1,694 wickets between them – including Sportsmail columnists Nasser Hussain and David 'Bumble' Lloyd alongside Gower, Andrew Strauss, Shane Warne, Michael Holding and Sir Ian Botham – as well as the stats man Benedict Bermange. The pundits and production staff are well . fed - they get an extensive menu at every ground, with the Ageas Bowl . providing options including prawn jalfrezi, with curry a favourite of . Botham and the rest, as well as salmon or lasagne. Each match alone needs more than 30 cameras, 40 microphones, 15 production trucks and 15 miles of cabling are placed around the ground and controlled by a crew of 80 staff. But there is one view cricket fans rarely glimpse - the sheer manpower that goes into providing the pictures. Gower – a veteran of 117 Tests, including 32 as England captain – said of the operation: ‘It is huge what goes on behind the scenes. 'Because of the innovations and the developments provided by the production staff we can be very forensic about pretty much anything. If you have someone like a Shane Warne up against you, if you think ""how do I steal a bit of a clue about facing them?"" You can view his action on screen in depth. That would have been – and now should be – an advantage. Close-up: Sky use 30 cameras in order to provide as many angles and slow-motion replays as possible . Pricey: For cricket coverage Sky Sports use this state-of-the-art truck... the most expensive in Europe . Wires: Hundreds of cables are attached to Sky's new broadcast truck used during the third Test . View: The truck is home to 78 different TV screens which each show a different feed of the match . On show: The director chooses from the different feeds what will be shown next on Sky's coverage . 'DRS (the Decision Review System) has helped to change the game on the field as well as for the viewers back home – we just have this strange situation where the Indians can opt out of it, but we can still use it in the studio and it has definitely moved the game forward.' Holding, the former West Indian fast bowler who was nicknamed the 'Whispering Death', was equally as effusive of Sky's development of cricket. In his famous Caribbean twang, Holding explained: 'Having all the information we get now cannot do the players any harm – if they don’t want to use it then ignore it. 'The most important thing for me as a former bowler is the Wagon Wheel which shows where a batsman scores his runs. That would have really helped me to decide where to bowl to them to starve them of runs and it is a great innovation.' Decisions on which pictures from the 30 camera feeds and the various gadgets used will be broadcast to the viewer next are decided from inside an £8m truck – the most expensive on the road in Europe – using 78 screens. In some ways the lavish expenditure on the production of cricket appears vulgar, but viewers want innovations, and in a world where budgets keep increasing and the likes of BT Sport are competing for every sport going, it makes sense to try and eek out every little bit to highlight how the coverage is different. Sky Sports has broadcast cricket since 1990 – when they showed live coverage of England’s tour of the West Indies. It has developed its production over time and the director’s truck which is the most expensive truck on the roads in Europe. Here are some of the main innovations since cricket started on Sky: . 1990 – Stump microphones . 1991 – Stump cameras . 1999 – Widescreen . 2000 – Interactivity (red button options) 2003 – Helmet-cams and player mics . 2004 – Umpire mics . 2004 – Ultra-motion replays . 2006 – Hi-motion replays . 2006 – High definition . 2007 – Hot Spot analysis . 2008 – Field Plan . 2009 – Pitchcam . 2010 – 3D international cricket . 2011 – 3D country cricket . 2013 – SkyCart . Sky Pad: Holding (left) and Ward (right) talk through issues on Sky Sports Zone in front of the cameras . Angles: Members of the 80-strong production staff trawl through footage to provide replays and analysis . Former captain Andrew Strauss is the newest member of the punditry team - having made the switch from the playing field to the commentary box. He said: 'I played with some of the guys before I came here but walking in on the first morning and being like: ""Hi guys, you are the people who have been criticising me for the last six years, nice to work with you"", was a bit strange. 'Everyone feels a little bit sheepish but it is very much a team environment in the commentary box.

James Anderson quickly claimed the final two wickets of India's first innings during the morning session before England rapidly scored 205 for four to leave the tourists needing a world record 445 runs to win the third Test. Cook and England have failed to win in their last 11 Tests but brilliant spin bowling from Moeen Ali and Joe Root reduced the Indians to a perilous 112 for four at stumps.

Proud: England bowling coach David Saker was full of praise for his bowling unit on day four . The tourists need 333 to win - having already lost their top four batsman - or they must survive a full fifth day with just six wickets left to scrape a draw. Saker told Sky Sports 2: 'The impressive thing has been their attitude. They’ve got stuck in and just gone and done their work and the results have come with that and that’s testament to this group. 'We’ve got a young group, pretty much other than Jimmy (Anderson) and Stuart (Broad), who have been really good in the way they have led us in theis Test.' With a particular mention for Anderson, who finished the day with figures of none for 13 from eight second-innings overs to go with his first-innings haul of five for 53, Saker added: 'He’s gone back to that magnificent control. 'We know he’s got the skill but if he backs that up with the control and putting the ball in difficult position for the batters, he always gets those rewards. Unit: Moeen Ali (left) and James Anderson (centre) were both pivotal to England's good bowling performance . 'We had a big chat about making sure we put the ball in a position where it is tough for the batsman, and we then use our skills to maybe move the ball and that’s pretty much what’s happened so far this game.' And Saker is confident that his men can get the job done on Thursday and finish off the tourists to level the series 1-1. He said: '(It’s about) running in and delivering the ball hard at a length, hitting the stumps as many times as you can and looking for the pads and the outside edge. 'It was pleasing today because we did have a couple of half appeals with inside edges hitting the pads and we got past the outside edge a bit.

Excitement continues to build with the Premier League season beginning on August 16... and that means you have just two weeks to finalise your MailOnline Fantasy Football team. With a £100million budget you may think the options are unlimited, but that cash needs to fund the purchase of 14 players so a bargain or two can go a long way. Here, Sportsmail give their recommendations on three must-have players for the spine of your team - Premier League powerhouses Tim Howard, John Terry and Yaya Toure. Fantasy: Sportsmail gives you the lowdown on three must-haves if you want to walk away with the title . Tim Howard (goalkeeper, Everton) - Value £5.4m . Howard excelled at the World Cup for the USA and he is likely to transfer that form to the Premier League for Roberto Martinez's side. At £5.4m Howard is a snip compared to Joe Hart (£6.0m) and Petr Cech (£5.8m) and his points return is likely to be extremely similar. Everton kept an impressive 15 clean sheets last season and Howard made some splendid saves, giving him an even greater return of points. A good side is built on a solid base with an exceptional goalkeeper and Howard fits the bill. He plays in a settled side and, at 35, is showing no signs of ageing. He made a World Cup record 16 saves in just one match in Brazil - if he was to do that in the Premier League then his points tally would rocket! Stopper: Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard is a perfect choice in goal at £5.4m due to his side's tight defence . You shall not pass: Howard made a World Cup record 16 saves against Belgium in Brazil, racking up the points . Blank: Everton kept 15 clean sheets last season, allowing Howard to accumulate lots of points . John Terry (defender, Chelsea) - Value £6.8m . If there is one thing Jose Mourinho is renowned for it is getting results based on clean sheets, and the Portuguese trusts his main lieutenant John Terry to provide them. The £6.8m price-tag is expensive for a defender but that is because you are signing the creme de la creme. Chelsea kept 16 clean sheets last season and Terry played on 34 occasions, meaning he brought in plenty of points. What's more, Terry scored three goals last season and he has already netted the same number in pre-season this year - so he can even contribute a bit going forward. He has an eye for goal at the minute so it could prove wise to capitalise on that while you can. The 33-year-old will be at the centre of Mourinho's title charge this season, meaning the points Terry provides really could end with prizes... Captain marvel: John Terry is Jose Mourinho's most trusted defensive lieutenant at Chelsea . Defensive: Terry (left) was key to Chelsea keeping 16 clean sheets last season in the Premier League . Attacking? The defender also popped up with three goals, and has scored three already in pre-season . Yaya Toure (midfielder, Manchester City) - Value £11.0m . He may be the most expensive midfielder on the game, but there's a perfectly good reason for that - Toure absolutely guarantees you points. The Ivorian scored an incredible 20 goals from midfield last season, making him worth his weight in gold. It's like having another striker! The 31-year-old also provided nine assists and kept 15 clean sheets, meaning he just racks up the points. He would be an ideal pick for captain as well, because he benefits from both scoring goals and gaining from Manchester City keeping clean sheets. What's more Toure barely misses a game - and for a team who won the title last season, he will continue to provide assists and find the back of the net. Man-of-the-match awards will also come in abundance for City's star man. He had an unsettled summer and will come back with a point to prove - he is the number one must-have pick. Pricey but worth it: Manchester City's Yaya Toure will set you back £11m but he will guarantee you points . Eye for goal: Toure (right) netted a staggering 20 goals from midfield for City last season . Total them up: Toure also provided nine assists and Manchester City kept an impressive 15 clean sheets .","The 2014-15 Premier League season kicks-off on August 16 .

"By . Chris Waugh . Newcastle United have completed the signing of Feyenoord right-back Daryl Janmaat for a fee of £5million. The 24-year-old has replaced Mathieu Debuchy on Tyneside after the France international full-back finally moved to Arsenal in a £10m deal on Thursday. But despite being an important member of Louis van Gaal's Holland squad at the World Cup, little is known of Janmaat. Here, Sportsmail tells you more... New signing: Holland right-back Daryl Janmaat has moved to Newcastle United from Feyenoord for £5million . Well then, who is he? Janmaat is a 24-year-old right-back - born in Leidschendam in southern Holland - who has represented the Dutch at Under-20, Under-21 and senior level. He has 21 senior Holland caps, making his debut against Turkey in September 2012, and featured five times under new Manchester United manager Van Gaal during the World Cup in Brazil where the Dutch finished third. Tackle: Janmaat (left) is not afraid to make a challenge and, although he is attacking, he can defend well too . Talented: Janmaat first played for ADO Den Haag, before moving to Heerenveen and then Feyenoord . What is his club record like? Solid and relatively impressive, if somewhat unspectacular. Janmaat broke into the first team at ADO Den Haag in 2007, playing 33 games and scoring three times for the second-tier Dutch side. The right-back was then snapped up by top-division outfit Heerenveen, where he spent four seasons, amassing 99 appearances and scoring on eight occasions. He was highly-regarded at the club and won the KNVB Cup - the Dutch equivalent of the FA Cup - in his first season. Following his successful spell at Heerenveen, Janmaat moved to Feyenoord on a free transfer once his contract expired. He quickly established himself in the team and was rewarded for his displays with a debut for the Holland side. He made 74 appearances for Feyenoord, scoring five times. All smiles: The 24-year-old is an attacking full-back and he is expected to fit straight into Newcastle's defence . Step-up? Janmaat has better league statistics than outgoing full-back Mathieu Debuchy had last season . How did he do last season? Last season Janmaat played extremely well for club side Feyenoord in the Dutch Eredivisie, helping them to second place in the league. In 30 league games, he scored twice and created five assists - showing the attacking threat he offers from full-back. He also had an 81 per cent pass completion ratio and 85 per cent tackle success rate - both higher than the player he is replacing, Debuchy, enjoyed in the Premier League last season. Although he is not the biggest defender in the world, he is decent in the air and is unlikely to be muscled off the ball. Going Dutch: Janmaat played five times at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil for Holland under Louis van Gaal . What sort of player are Newcastle getting? Alan Pardew is effectively getting a like-for-like replacement for the outgoing Debuchy. Janmaat loves to get forward and he will attack at every opportunity, overlapping his winger and offering himself up in the opposition half. He is extremely quick and is arguably a better defender than Debuchy as he covers the defence well and can sweep up opposition attacks. His attacking ability was shown during the third-place play-off during the World Cup when he overlapped well to expertly pass the ball to Georginio Wijnaldum to score the Dutch's third goal against Brazil. Looking up: Janmaat is quick and is likely to excite the St James' Park faithful with his overlapping runs . Any weaknesses? No obvious weaknesses that make him a liability, but his desire to attack has on occasion left a gap at right-back that the opposition can exploit. He is not weak but he is not the strongest so it may take him a little bit of time to adapt to the pace and power of the Premier League, although the Eredivisie has many similarities and so that should not be a problem long-term. Where will he fit in at Newcastle? He will slot straight in at the right-back slot vacated by Debuchy, who has left for Arsenal for £10m. Janmaat will be Pardew's first choice and he will likely be accompanied in defence by captain Fabricio Coloccini, Mike Williamson and Massadio Haidara. Gone: Janmaat replaces France right-back Mathieu Debuchy (pictured) who has signed for Arsenal . How did he end up in the North-East? Despite impressing during his time at Feyenoord, challenging for the Dutch title was not the height of his ambitions - Janmaat has described the transfer to Newcastle as the 'perfect move' for him right now. The full-back has been linked with Juventus and Arsenal in the past - as well as Manchester United due to the Van Gaal connection - and Janmaat confirmed he turned down interest from Italy to move to the North-East of England.

"By . Paul Newman . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . Gary Ballance, perhaps wisely, chose a low-key way to celebrate his third century in only his sixth Test in what became his first win with England. ‘I stayed in with a DVD,’ he said about victory in Southampton. ‘It was suggested to us that it might not be the best idea to go out.’ It is not difficult to see why. The last time Ballance, 24, did that, after the drawn first Test in Nottingham, he ended up shirtless and the worse for wear in the Pandora’s Box nightclub, shouting ‘England, England,’ as he was helped out. Scroll down for video... Lesson learnt: Gary Ballance is letting his cricket do the talking after his embarrassing night out . One too many! Here is how the Daily Mail reported Gary Ballance's night of shame . The resulting ticking off and acute embarrassment for a young batsman making his way in the England team was a severe test of his character. But it is one he responded to, scoring two centuries in the two Tests since in what is becoming one of the great introductions to the ultimate form of the game. ‘On that first morning at Lord’s I was a bit nervous and embarrassed,’ he admitted. ‘I was under pressure after what happened but that may have been good for me because I put in a performance and proved a few people wrong.’ It should be pointed out that the players had been given permission to go out after the Trent Bridge Test and Ballance did not break any team rules, was not out excessively late and did not behave badly to any members of the public. Yet it was not a good look for an elite sportsman four days before the next Test, not least because England were in the middle of such a dismal run and had very little at that stage to celebrate. Ballance insists he has learnt his lesson. ‘I have joked that I had bowled a maiden at Trent Bridge and wanted to celebrate,’ said Ballance. ‘But the timing of it coming out made me feel as if I’d let the team down the night before Lord’s. It’s not what you want from yourself. ‘We had been told we could go out and I like to let my hair down a bit at the right times but not in a stupid way. I probably had one too many. And I can’t ever remember taking my shirt off before. I was nervous about what my parents would think but they were very understanding. I think they have even framed one of the pictures of me!’ Big hitter: Gary Ballance recorded his first Test victory in the third match against India at the Ageas Bowl . That night, when pictures that at least confirmed Ballance has worked on his body shape and fitness emerged, England captain Alastair Cook decided to take the Zimbabwe-born player for a meal to make sure his mind was on the next day’s job. ‘I wasn’t told off as such,’ said Ballance after being reminded of his responsibilities. ‘It was more a slap on the wrist and I was told not to do it again. Then Cooky took me out for some food with Joe Root and Matt Prior and told me that it can happen and I would be laughing about it in a few days. He also said these things are quickly forgotten, but I’m not sure that’s the case just yet.’ At least his form and England’s Investec series-levelling win at the Ageas Bowl have turned more attention on Ballance’s batting than his drinking. He is not an eye-catching performer, but he is proving mightily effective in Jonathan Trott’s old position of No 3. Three hundreds, two further half centuries and 628 runs in total at an average of 62.80 is some going for this adopted Yorkshireman, especially in a team which before Southampton had been struggling so much. ‘I couldn’t have asked for a better start and I really didn’t expect it to go like this,’ admitted Ballance, who was asked to bat at three at the behest of Peter Moores before the series against Sri Lanka. ‘When the coaches back you to bat there it’s a massive boost because Trotty has done an unbelievable job there, scoring runs for fun, and they were big shoes to fill. Stats amazing! The Yorkshireman has hit three centuries in his fledgling Test career, with a run average of 62.8 . ‘I feel I’m batting up there with the best I’ve ever done,’ said Ballance, who was originally approached to join Yorkshire by Geoff Boycott after he had spent two years at Derbyshire when he first came to England. ‘I had a decent start to the county season and I’m delighted to have brought my form to Test cricket.’ And now he has his first Test victory, along with five other members of England’s third Test team, a landmark he celebrated by grabbing a stump as he ran from the Ageas Bowl when India were defeated. ‘The lads gave me some stick for that,’ he said. ‘Jimmy Anderson was man of the match and he didn’t get one. But I’ve still got that stump. Winning is a great feeling after such a tough time.’ *Investec, the specialist bank and asset manager, is the title sponsor of Test cricket in England.

Jimmy Anderson came under fire from India again as he began preparing for a ‘home’ Test at Old Trafford that could take him to the brink of English bowling history. Anderson, dramatically cleared of abusing and pushing Ravindra Jadeja last week, will go into Thursday’s fourth Test needing only 13 wickets to become England’s leading wicket-taker of all time but with India still seething over his behaviour at Trent Bridge. The speed with which judicial commissioner Gordon Lewis threw out a Level Three charge against Anderson on Friday was an embarrassment for India, but they are showing little sign of taking it on the chin and moving on. Common sense prevails: James Anderson has been cleared lf physically assaulting Ravindra Jedeja (R) Spat: Anderson and Jadeja were embroiled in a row as they left the Trent Bridge pitch . Delight: Anderson cannot hide his emotions after dismissing Jadeja at the Ageas Bowl . VIDEO Jadeja and Anderson cleared of wrong-doing . An unnamed BCCI official was scathing in his criticism of England’s attack leader on the respected Wisden India website and it is clear that a country who are used to getting their own way still hope to force an appeal. ‘Clearly the judgment is incorrect,’ said the Indian official of a verdict made by Lewis in just 10 minutes after six hours of expensive evidence. ‘And it sets a very bad example. There were a series of errors. The level of abuse has been ridiculous and the ICC have a lot to answer for. What example does it set for kids and others watching? It sends the message that it is OK to abuse and push and you’ll still go scot-free. ‘The umpire (Bruce Oxenford) has mentioned in his witness statement that Anderson used the ‘f’ and ‘c’ words repeatedly. Why haven’t the officials reported him to the ICC? If they have, why has no action been taken?’ The comments confirm that the crux of India’s high-handed complaint, which was driven by captain MS Dhoni despite attempts by the ICC, ECB and even his own Board to talk him out of it, was sparked by Anderson’s sledging. The man who could overtake Sir Ian Botham by the end of this series is quiet, almost shy, off the field but gets himself into ‘battle mode’ when he steps on to it. Anderson has talked about the two sides to his personality and his work with a sports psychologist, calling himself Jimmy on the field and James off it. England feel Anderson is at his best when he is Jimmy but also in control of his emotions. He is already England’s leading wicket-taker in all international cricket and, just 32, he looks poised to break every record in the book, testament to his exceptional competitiveness, skill and work ethic. The question now is whether the Lancastrian can keep his aggression in check and still bowl as well as he did at the Ageas Bowl when he reached heights not seen from him for over a year. And avoid any more flashpoints. Leader of the attack: Anderson was man of the match in England's third Test win at the Ageas Bowl . For fourth Test vs India at Old Trafford, starting on August 7 . Cook (c), Ali, Anderson, Ballance,  Bell,  Broad, Buttler (wkt), Jordan, Plunkett, Robson,  Root, Stokes, Woakes. Any appeal against the Australian judge’s verdict — and Lewis also cleared Jadeja of all wrong-doing — can only come through ICC chief executive David  Richardson and there seemed  little appetite for official intervention on Monday despite India’s huffing and puffing. The deadline for an appeal and a further twist in this acrimonious tale is Friday. England’s perfect script sees Anderson driving England to victory in this series and overtaking Botham in the final Test at the Kia Oval, his 99th and the last England will play until they tour the Caribbean next April. Yet Anderson has never taken five wickets in an innings on his home ground. It now seems certain that Stuart Broad will be fit enough to take  his place, while Chris Woakes looks sure to get another chance, leaving three bowlers competing for the last seam place. Chris Jordan is in possession and was exceptional at Old Trafford in the one-day international against Sri Lanka this season, while Ben Stokes is a strong contender on what is expected to be the quickest pitch of the Investec series. England have to be careful they do not chop and change too much but there is a strong case for  Steven Finn, added to the squad on Sunday when Liam Plunkett pulled out with injury, to leapfrog Jordan and Stokes on a pitch where his extra pace could well prove a handful. Ulterior motives? England believe that Ravindra Jadeja's accusations were a purely tactical move by India .","James Anderson was found not guilty of Level Three offence by ICC .

"By . Chris Cutmore . Follow @@Chris_Cutmore . Victor Dubuisson insists he’s ‘just a normal person’. When pressed about his life he says ‘I’m just… nothing special, you know’. Let’s reappraise that modest statement. He is a normal person, but one with an outside chance of winning The Open at on Sunday. And, despite his protestations, he is very special indeed. Dubuisson gatecrashed the top of the leaderboard at Hoylake after a third round 68 left him in fifth, eight shots behind Rory McIlroy with 18 holes to play. But whether or not the fairytale victory comes, Dubuisson is set for a year to remember. Talent: France's Victor Dubuisson is now a near-certainty to qualify for Europe's Ryder Cup team . The 24-year-old from Cannes has now announced his talent to the world. A former amateur No 1, Dubuisson’s first big victory came over Tiger Woods and a quality field in Turkey last November, and his short-game magic mesmerised in the final of the WGC Accenture Match Play in February. Dubuisson is now proving he can challenge at major championships and is now a near-certainty to qualify for Europe’s Ryder Cup team at Gleneagles. But, first things first, can he lift the Claret Jug today? ‘I’ll just try to do my best,’ he says. ‘If the putts go in, it can be a good day.’ Battle: Jimmy Walker and Victor Dubuisson can expect to go head-to-head at Gleneagles . He says he can handle the pressure on the biggest stages, whether at Hoylake or in Perthshire this autumn. ‘If the crowd is big, it’s not really a big difference,’ he claims. ‘I really focus on my game on the course.’ As chance would have it, Dubuisson played alongside Jimmy Walker, who is nailed-on to be a rookie on the American team in September. Walker had a flying start, but no birdies in his closing 13 holes mean the 35-year-old Oklahoman is out of the running. ‘I’m pretty bummed about the way the round finished,’ he admitted. Disappointment: Adam Scott slid down the leaderboard after a birdieless front nine on Saturday . He has formed the basis of a friendship with his European counterpart over the past few weeks, having played together at the US Open. ‘Victor’s a nice guy, he’s quiet, I enjoy playing with him,’ said Walker. Of course, that will be forgotten in the maelstrom of intercontinental matchplay, as Walker coldly insists: ‘I’m confident taking anybody on.’ Adam Scott, their playing partner, slid down the leaderboard after a birdie-less front nine and looked disconsolate after a double bogey on the 10th. But a birdie on the 11th and four more on the back nine lifted the spirits. Scott needs a miracle but is still fighting at six under par. Dubuisson, at eight under par, still has hopes of a maiden major. This small battle has been won by Europe, but there are plenty more in store at Gleneagles.","Dubuisson moved up to fifth, eight shots behind Rory McIlroy with 18 to play at Hoylake .

"By . Paul Newman . England looked flat just after tea at Old Trafford, Stuart Broad was in hospital and the prospect of Hurricane Bertha blowing away the last two days of this fourth Test loomed large. Then Hurricane Moeen rocked India’s foundations. What an extraordinary transformation in a last session which saw nine wickets crash and England claim a sensational innings-and-54-run victory to guarantee at least a share of this Investec series. And what a spineless, pathetic display from an India side who have imploded since their historic victory at Lord’s under the leadership of a captain in MS Dhoni who just did not look interested. VIDEO Scroll for Alastair Cook on England victory and Stuart Broad nose-break update . Great day: Moeen Ali celebrates dismissing Mahendra Singh Dhoni as one of his four wickets at Old Trafford . Done and dusted: Chris Jordan finished off India at Old Trafford as the hosts crushed the visitors on day three . How crucial, with biblical rain apparently heading to Manchester, was the intervention of the remarkable Moeen Ali and the brilliant Jimmy Anderson in a thrilling session which gave England victory in effectively two-and-a-half days. The farcical loss of at least two hours of play on Friday because of the limitations of the Lancashire drainage had increased the need for England to press for victory with such a bad forecast for the final two days. Yet it seemed that they would face frustration, not least when Broad was struck such a nasty blow through his helmet on to his nose that not only ruled him out of bowling yesterday but may force him to miss the Oval Test next week. England initially looked lacklustre in the field, Anderson appeared out of sorts and Broad was being badly missed as India moved to 33 at tea for the loss of only Murali Vijay, who provided Chris Woakes with a much-needed wicket. Easy does it: Jordan wheels away as Pankaj Singh can only look back at his wicket as India lost out . All India had to do was bat their way through a single session against a depleted England attack and then hope that Mother Nature could come to their rescue and allow them to head south for the final Test with all to play for. Yet they could not even do that, crashing to a humiliating defeat which saw four wickets fall for eight runs before all remaining nine were demolished for a further 128 runs to leave India in tatters. India’s inadequacy should take nothing away from the brilliance of an England side who have spectacularly found their feet under Alastair Cook after hitting rock bottom with their own last-day capitulation in the second Test. At the centre of the drama was again the distinctive figure of Moeen who, in the space of two Tests, has gone from a spinner whom England did not really trust to a match-winner of almost Graeme Swann-like proportions. Tough day: Virat Kohli and co had a nightmare while Jimmy Anderson chipped in with a couple of wickets . Delighted: Jordan jumps for joy as he wraps up the victory on day three at Old Trafford on Saturday . It was at Old Trafford where Moeen once took 12 wickets in a match for Worcestershire and now he mesmerised an India side supposedly proficient against spin for the second successive Test after excelling in Southampton. Moeen had taken six wickets in the second innings in that comprehensive victory at the Ageas Bowl and now he added four more to thrill the Manchester crowd and take his tally to an extraordinary 19 in four matches in this series. When you consider that only Ray Illingworth, with 20 victims in 1967, has taken more wickets with spin in a home series against India for England then you can appreciate the scale of this Test novice’s achievement. India simply had no answer to Moeen, who has bowled his off-spin significantly quicker since Lord’s, and the imperious Anderson, who claimed supposed danger man Virat Kohli for the fourth time for just seven runs. Reasons to be cheerful: Alastair Cook and James Anderson leave the pitch after winning the Test match . That was a second wicket for Anderson, cleared by judge Gordon Lewis before the match over his spat with Ravindra Jadeja and now just eight wickets away from overtaking Sir Ian Botham and becoming England’s leading Test wicket-taker. The stage is set for him to claim the record at The Oval. Anderson left the field for 35 minutes feeling unwell after claiming Kohli, a concern for England with the fifth Test coming on Friday, but he was back by the time Chris Jordan wrapped up victory with the final two wickets in two balls. Jordan had earlier been denied the wicket of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, well caught by Ian Bell, when he overstepped but it barely held up England, who had the game wrapped up by 6.20pm, to the joy of a near capacity Old Trafford crowd. Moeen even had a hand in the one wicket that did not fall to a bowler, turning and throwing brilliantly to run out Kumar and make up for Jordan’s mistake in denying himself a wicket that would have been invaluable to him. Painful: Broad takes a big hit to the face after a Varun Aaron ball went straight through the grille of his helmet . Distress: Broad looks in a bad way after the incident on Saturday afternoon . Bandaged up: Broad looks in a much better way after getting treatment for the injury . England had earlier batted with admirable tempo to extend their overnight lead to 215, Joe Root and Jos Buttler leading the way before Broad was struck an ugly blow the ball after pulling Varun Aaron for successive sixes. Broad had cut a disconsolate figure as he walked round the Old Trafford outfield having had his nose stitched up to depart for hospital and checks for both a break and possible concussion. Yet England’s heroics and his award as man of the match would have cheered him, not least the way England found a way to win so spectacularly without him and with Jordan and Woakes still failing to match the bowling of the big two. Bad day: Murali Vijay walks from the field with his head down after his dismissal and India's collapse . Broad’s fitness for The Oval must be in doubt but Liam Plunkett, who faces a fitness test tomorrow, is confident of being fit after a foot injury while the return of Steven Finn to the squad for this match showed he is on the way back. Suddenly England are looking a formidable young side and can look forward to The Oval with much excitement.","England thrash visitors and win by an innings and 54 runs at Old Trafford .

"Rory . By . Chris Cutmore . Follow @@Chris_Cutmore . Rory McIlroy has no chance of winning The Open if he continues to risk using his driver on links golf courses, insists former champion Tony Jacklin. Tiger Woods had the perfect strategy for attacking Hoylake when he won here eight years ago, avoiding fairway bunkers by using his low-flying ‘stinger’ iron off nearly every tee. But this year’s softer conditions mean more players will consider attacking the course from the tee. High risk: Rory McIlroy takes out his driver during a practice round on Wednesday . McIlroy has a two-iron in his bag this week but has admitted he will be using his driver just as often. Jacklin, who is the last Englishman to win the Claret Jug in England when he won at Royal Lytham in 1969, says that could be a disastrous tactic for the Northern Irishman. ‘Tiger Woods will have the strategy absolutely nailed down. He will be playing an iron a lot more than Rory,’ said Jacklin on Wednesday. ‘But Rory, despite being brought up on links golf, is historically not that good a links player. It’s about figuring out that the game is still played on the ground here.’ Jacklin explained that he thought hitting drivers could only lead to problems at Hoylake and cited three links legends  – Tom Watson, Peter Thomson and Bobby Locke, who have 14 Open titles between them – as the men McIlroy must emulate if he wants to improve on a record of just one top-10 at the Open. Big draw: McIlroy signs autographs for young fans during practice round at Royal Liverpool . VIDEO McIlroy starts strongly at Hoylake . ‘If you hit a driver up into the elements it gives the wind longer to affect the ball, and when it lands it doesn’t run as far so you’re gaining minimal distance anyway. It’s not about distance. All the great Open champions all figured it out: keep the ball under control, avoid the hazards. The key to links golf is strategy and patience.’ Hoylake is famed for the strong winds which blow in off the Wirral Estuary and provide the course’s main defence. But the weather forecast for this week looks good with just light winds. Jacklin, who is at Hoylake as an ambassador for Glenmorangie, is hoping for a sterner test, however. ‘If players are taking drivers and the wind blows they’re not going to be able to get round,’ he said. ‘These courses can be horrendous when the wind blows. Warning: Former champion Tony Jacklin (left) with Lee Westwood . ‘I remember one of the last Opens I played in, at Lytham, Jeff Maggert was hitting driver off every tee.  I felt like saying: “What are you doing? What are you trying to achieve?” ‘I know links golf better than I know anything. I’ve been playing it for 50 years in all conditions. I hope the wind blows. It’s the supreme test.’","Rory McIlroy has admitted he will be using his driver at Hoylake .

Rory McIlroy has joined the pantheon of golfing greats by winning his first Open title – and his third in total – at the age of 25 following a thrilling final round at Hoylake. In the history of the game only Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods – the two greatest players of them all - had won three majors by that tender age, but that is the exalted company McIlroy is now keeping. McIlroy had to hold off a charge from Sergio Garcia to lift the Claret Jug for the first time, and is now three quarters of the way to a career grand slam in majors, having already won the US Open and US PGA Championship.

McIlroy’s huge hitting game, surely it is only a matter of time before . the Northern Irishman completes the full set. McIlroy began the day with a huge . six-shot advantage over Rickie Fowler but the orange-clad American was . not able to challenge his playing partner. Instead the man who came . closest to hunting McIlroy down was Garcia, who imploded here dressed in . yellow eight years ago when Tiger Woods won and then told friends he . had just ‘bludgeoned Tweety Pie’. But, despite Garcia’s brilliant round . of 66, McIlroy closed out a two-shot victory with a closing 71 and a . winning total of 271 strokes - 17 under par. If McIlroy was feeling any nerves as he stood on the first tee those were immediately settled when he crunched a bullet drive down the first fairway before draining a putt from 15 feet for an opening birdie and stretched his lead to seven strokes.

McIlroy dropped two shots in . successive holes at the fifth and sixth, but still led by four heading . into the back nine after picking one back at the short ninth. The Spaniard, however, made his big . move by eagling the long 10th hole and by the 13th McIlroy’s lead was . just two strokes. But once Gaarcia left a bunker shot in the sand at the . 15th victory was all but assured. Hoylake stood to acclaim McIlroy as . he walked down the 18th fairway.

'It feels incredible,' McIlroy told the BBC. 'Today wasn't easy. There were a lot of guys making runs at me and I just needed to stay focused, keep in the present and concentrate on what I was doing out there. 'To be three legs towards the career grand slam at the age of 25 is a pretty good achievement. It's not going to sink in for a while."" Asked if he always felt in control, McIlroy added: 'The lead never got less than two. I always felt I had that little bit of a cushion. 'I knew I had some holes where I could make birdie and 16 was the real hole for me which I think settled the championship.' Speaking about the bet struck by his father and three friends, he added: 'I don't think it matters so much to my dad anymore but the team-mates he did it with, I think they're a little happier.

The right-back followed his French compatriots to the Premier League champions on a free after declining several contract offers in North London. And after seeing the success Nasri and Clichy have enjoyed, Sagna says it was an easy decision to make once he was sure he wanted to leave the Gunners.

Sagna is believed to have been offered a £150,000-a-week package to join City, where he will battle with Pablo Zabaleta to be first choice.

No sentimentality: Sagna says Arsenal are just another club for City to beat in the Premier League . He won't have to wait long to meet his former team-mates again though, with the two clubs due to meet at the Emirates Stadium in the fourth game of the season.

Arsene Wenger's first response to Yaya Sanogo's performance on Saturday was one that was replicated by astonished Arsenal fans. The former Auxerre striker finally burst on to the Gunners scene in the 5-1 win against Benfica after a questionable first year, netting four goals. Joel Campbell also scored as Arsenal impressed in the Emirates Cup, giving Wenger something to think about ahead of the new season. Unlikely hero: Yaya Sanogo was a man possessed on Saturday, scoring four goals against Benfica for Arsenal . Praise: Arsene Wenger admitted he was surprised, but said the youngster has a bright future at the club . In the mood: Sanogo celebrated his goals with a unique dance in front of the Emirates Stadium crowd . Alexis Sanchez was signed to vastly improve Arsenal's striking options as they aim for a title challenge, but Wenger admits the often erratic Sanogo has the potential to make it in North London. Sanogo was injured for basically two years before he came to us. If you look at his goal scoring record before he got injured, it is quite frightening,' Wenger told reporters. 'You could see when he scored the first goal today, suddenly they can raining. I especially liked the third goal he scored, it was really the goal of a striker of quality. 'He has a big future here, or course, he is 21. He has something of Adebayor. He is strong, a strong body, similar strengths (to Adebayor), but as well technical skill.' Core players: Wenger says he can slowly improve the England team with players like Calum Chambers . Point to prove: Jack Wilshere also featured on Saturday, another young Three Lions player . Calum Chambers was another player looking to make a point, and he excelled at centre-back, a position Wenger may look to utilise him in.

'He is 19 years old, and what he did is very promising. 'I told you we will have a core of English players, you have to trust me, I will get you slowly a good national team.' Impact: Wenger has a word with new signing Alexis Sanchez ahead of the Chilean's debut for the Gunners . Another swoop? Wenger hinted that he had enquired for Real Madrid midfielder Sami Khedira . Fans were in a buoyant mood after the pre-season victory, helped by early deals in the transfer market. But Wenger has already insisted he won't stop there. Sami Khedira has been heavily linked with a switch in recent weeks, and while the 64-year-old denied Arsenal had made a bid for the Real Madrid midfielder, he did hint that some contact had been made.

Larrazabal was playing the 14th hole of his second round at the Maybank Malaysian Open when he was suddenly attacked by a swarm of giant hornets. The 30-year-old from Barcelona was forced to flee from the angry swarm and, after failing to escape his attackers, dived into a lake and took cover under water in a desperate bid to shake off the insects, which he described as 'three times the size of bees'.

Tiger Woods insists that victory is the only acceptable result for him at The Open this week, despite playing in only his second tournament since undergoing major back surgery. The 14-time major champion had been expected to use Hoylake as the next step in his recovery from the operation on a herniated disc. A serious challenge for the Claret Jug this week appeared  beyond even Woods’s superhuman powers. But Woods was in bullish mood on Tuesday morning having spent several days at the scene of one of his greatest victories and was adamant that a fourth Open title is firmly on his mind. VIDEO Scroll down for Tiger Woods and Rory Mcilroy prepare for The Open . Confident: Tiger Woods said that anything less than a win at The Open would be unacceptable . Preparation: Woods practices at Hoylake on Tuesday ahead of his quest to win The Open . At a press conference ahead of The Open, Woods was asked what an acceptable finish would be given his recent injury turmoil.  ‘First’ came the quick reply.  Asked if anything less than first was unacceptable,  Woods responded flatly: ‘That’s always the case.’ Woods arrived at Hoylake on Saturday afternoon and quickly played a practice round on the course where he won his third Open in 2006, just two months after his father Earl had died of cancer. The American superstar said he also practiced on Sunday before taking Monday off to rest. He clearly likes what he sees flying off the clubface. The key to Woods’s confidence is being pain-free, which he says has not been the case for many years. Woods said emerging unscathed from his comeback tournament at Congressional in Washington last week was a ‘big boost’, despite missing the cut. Previous: The 38-year-old has won The Open on three previous occasions, in 2000, 2005 and 2006 . ‘It’s getting better,’ said Woods. ‘There’s no pain. I came back and hit it as hard as I want to hit it. I’m getting stronger and faster. That’s only going to continue. He added: ‘I’m not quite at the level I think I can be at in terms of explosion through the golf ball but I’m pretty darn close.’ Woods pointed out that arguably his greatest victory had come on the back of serious surgery. He stunned the world by winning the 2008 US Open at Torrey Pines despite having undergone keyhole surgery on his left knee just weeks before, while also suffering from stress fractures in his left leg and a ruined anterior cruciate ligament. On the mend: Woods is still recovering from undergoing major back surgery . Focus: Woods practices at Hoylake . ‘I’ve been in circumstances like this before,’ Woods said referring to 2008. ‘I had surgery after the Masters and I didn’t play until the US Open. I won it. I didn’t break 50 for nine holes before but I won the US Open with a broken leg and torn ACL.’ Woods admitted that this injury, however, had been the toughest he had ever had to deal with. So tough, in fact, that it could have forced him to retire from the game. ‘There was point in time when my knee was bad and it was tough,’ said the 38-year-old. ‘But with this injury I didn’t want to do anything. I couldn’t get out of bed, move around house or anything. It made me appreciate how I was able to play for so long such a high level. With no ACL I could still play. Not with this injury. I couldn’t enjoy my life.’ ‘If I was still feeling like that then I couldn’t play again. People who have had my surgery say the same thing: it changes your whole life. I don’t have pain all the way down my leg now. But I knew I could come back. It was just a matter of time before I could play at the elite level.’ Woods has had to battle through more than just injury since he broke down in tears on Hoylake’s 18th green six years ago. Infamous issues in his private life have changed forever the way he will be perceived by the world. But Woods revealed that his previous visit to Hoylake was one of just a few times in his entire career where he has ‘felt at peace’ on the course. The other occasions were his record-breaking victories at Augusta in 1997 and Pebble Beach in 2000, two of the most destructive performances in the game’s history. ‘It just happens,’ he said. ‘Maybe because I was in control of my game. The times I’ve had that feeling I’ve played really well. Everything was working. On the Sunday I felt my dad was with me. It felt like he was my 15th club. I felt that peace out there.’ VIDEO Tiger aims to roar once more .","Woods says only first place would be acceptable at Hoylake .

"By . Chris Cutmore . Follow @@Chris_Cutmore . Rory McIlroy survived the first big test of his nerve at Hoylake in spectacular style to set up the most glorious chance he will surely ever have to win his first Open Championship. There will be plenty more challenges to overcome on the back nine on Sunday, but the way McIlroy swatted away the challenge of Rickie Fowler with an eagle at the par-five 16th hole and then another at the 18th was the stuff of the greatest major champions. McIlroy will now take a six-shot lead into the final round of The Open after carding 68 on a day when The Open was played for the first time in its 143-year history with a two-tee start. The bold decision was made by the R&A following forecasts for Saturday afternoon of electrical storms, but these never materialised and, bizarrely, everything was wrapped up before 4pm.

"By . Matt Morlidge . Follow @@MattMorlidge . Thomas Vermaelen’s stint as Arsenal’s club captain is close to an end with the Belgian defender destined for a move to Barcelona. Few fans will miss the 28-year-old as a leader as injury problems coupled with a lack of form have seen him ousted from the starting line-up, let alone from his role as skipper. But every Premier League challenger needs a leader, and in that respect the Gunners have a sizeable hole to fill. Here, Sportsmail looks as the possible candidates to replace Vermaelen this season. Scroll down for video... On his way? Arsenal captain is set to leave the Emirates for Spanish giants Barcelona . MIKEL ARTETA . Would seem to be the logical choice after his vice-captain duties last season made him the go-to skipper in big games for Arsene Wenger, including the FA Cup final. Doubts remain over the 32-year-old’s future at the club though, with his contract due to expire at the end of the 2014/15 season. Supporters may doubt the Spaniard’s presence on the pitch too. Arteta is a man who keeps his cool in possession, but is hardly a grafter or a natural leader. Helping hand: Last season's vice-captain Mikel Arteta gives new signing Callum Chambers advice in training . VIDEO Arteta expecting great season . PER MERTESACKER . Searching for a presence? Well look no further. Standing at 6’7” the German World Cup winner demands respect. Along with Arteta would be a sensible choice for Wenger, having stood in for Vermaelen and the Spaniard last season. Commanding at the back, screaming instructions throughout the game, even idolising Tony Adams as a youngster; Mertesacker appears to be the best fit for the role in this squad. BFG: Per Mertesacker returns to Arsenal as a World Cup winner and is not afraid to speak his mind . AARON RAMSEY . After a stellar breakthrough year last season Ramsey will be in Wenger’s thoughts when considering his options. Having captained Wales in 2012, albeit at the wrong time for an out-of-form youngster, the 23-year-old has already been picked out as a future leader. Can he fulfill that role at Arsenal? He’s a regular starter, popular in the dressing room and a perfect professional. Don’t rule him out... Enter the dragon? Aaron Ramsey was Arsenal's most influential player before injury last season . JACK WILSHERE . Having progressed through the youth ranks Wilshere possesses the ‘Arsenal D.N.A’. However, after his recent antics he doesn’t quite fall under the role model category. The father-of-two has been pictured smoking and partying in Las Vegas, while he has work to do to break back into this talented first XI after injury problems since his early promise. Wenger is certainly a fan of the Stevenage-born midfielder though. ‘Of course he will be one of the leaders of this club - in fact he is already on the pitch,’ Wenger said back in 2013. ‘I think Jack will be captain of this club this day - yes, of course.’ Time will tell. Worth a risk? Arsene Wenger is an admirer of Jack Wilshere (L) but there are doubts over his lifestyle . LAURENT KOSCIELNY . Having been Arsenal’s most consistent player over the last two years, the French international automatically qualifies as a candidate. Not a leader as such - instead doing his talking on the pitch - Koscielny has built up a formidable partnership with Mertesacker at the heart of defence. French fancy? Defender Laurent Koscielny is a guaranteed starter but is not a born leader . Honourable mentions . Wojciech Szczesny - A character, if nothing else. The selfie machine (along with Lukas Podolski) keeps spirits high in North London and has improved as a goalkeeper, but he must rank down the list. Tomas Rosicky - Experience, professionalism, one of the manager’s favourites. Rosicky has stood in as captain on occasions but in truth doesn’t play often enough to merit the position. Glove affair? Goalkeeper Wojiech Szczesny is popular in the dressing room but an outsider for the captaincy . Abou Diaby - The longest serving player in this current squad. He’s a regular starter, right? Watch out for... Calum Chambers - Wenger has high hopes for the 19-year-old, who in his little experience at the club so far can already be seen organising his new team-mates from the back.

"By . Adam Shergold . Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel believes Louis van Gaal is the perfect man to restore the club's faded fortunes. The former goalkeeper, who played at Old Trafford between 1991 and 1999, is an admirer of the Dutchman's courage in making decisions other managers would never take. For example, in Holland's World Cup quarter-final with Costa Rica, Van Gaal replaced goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen with penalty specialist Tim Krul just moments before the shoot-out and his team duly prevailed on spot-kicks. Backing: Peter Schmeichel believes Louis van Gaal is the right manager to restore Manchester United to the pinnacle of the Barclays Premier League and admires his gutsy decision-making . New man: Louis van Gaal was appointed new Man United manager following the disastrous David Moyes era . The Dane told the Daily Mirror: 'Van Gaal did one or two things in the World Cup which were quite noticeable and have put his name right up there. They were things no one else ever dared to do. 'So he looks to be his own man who knows exactly what he wants to do. I think we should be contending for the title again this season under him. 'He has always been someone who is at a big club like Bayern Munich and Barcelona and done good things. Hopefully he can do the same at Manchester United.' European pedigree: Van Gaal guided Ajax to Champions League success back in 1995 . Bold decision: In Holland's World Cup quarter-final with Costa Rica, Van Gaal replaced first choice goalkeeper Jasper Cilessen with Tim Krul (second right), who duly won them the penalty shoot-out . Legend: Peter Schmeichel made over 300 appearances for the Old Trafford club between 1991 and 1999 . Van Gaal arrives at Old Trafford with a proven track record - he has won seven league titles in three countries and the Champions League with Ajax in 1995. He guided Holland to third place at the World Cup in Brazil this summer before taking up his post at United. The Dutchman favours an attack-minded 3-5-2 formation and this is likely to provide plenty of entertainment in the Premier League. United face Valencia in their final friendly on Tuesday night before starting the season at home to Swansea City on Saturday lunchtime.","Former Manchester United goalkeeper Schmeichel believes Louis van Gaal will guide club back to Premier League summit this season .

"By . Matt Morlidge . Follow @@MattMorlidge . After their Premier League title challenge faded away at the back of last season, Arsenal have started the summer in exactly the right fashion. The signing of Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona in a £30million deal was confirmed on Thursday; the second highest transfer in the club's history, . The Chilean's arrival has provided fans with genuine belief that they can prolong their stay at the top of the table this season, while adding to the many attacking options at Arsene Wenger's disposal. But how will the team shape up? VIDEO: Scroll down to see the Arsenal players, including Sanchez, in the new Puma kit . A Gun deal: Here's how £30million signing Alexis Sanchez will look in the new Arsenal kit . Signal of intent: The Chilean has the potential to play in all the front areas; he can be whatever he wants to be . Reason to cheer? Arsene Wenger could revel in a first title win in 10 years . Challengers: How Arsenal could line up next season . 'Players win games, squads win titles,' is a quote often banded about when talking of Premier League glory, and a way in which the Gunners have fallen short in recent years. Too often key players have picked up injuries at crucial times of the season, too often there hasn't been enough adequate cover in the squad. Take last season, when Wenger had to call upon the inexperienced Yaya Sanogo in pivotal games due to Olivier Giroud's form and fitness worries. But after convincing Sanchez to join, Wenger has a wealth of attacking options available. The 25-year-old has proved himself in many positions during some impressive displays for Barcelona and Chile. He has the potential to partner Giroud (who will realistically start due to the physical nature in England) or supply him from the left and right. Couple that with Theo Walcott's imminent return from knee injury, and the French striker can no longer complain of being isolated up front. And if that doesn't sound exciting enough, it should also see Mesut Ozil drastically improve. The German playmaker was the star of the last transfer window - signing for £42.5m - but struggled to adapt to English football, not helped by the lack of pace to supply. Now the Gunners could simply blow teams away with pace and style. 'Playing the Arsenal way,' as Wenger would put it. The boss has been patient for so long, and has been rewarded with the money to go out and attract the world's best. Set to shine: £42.5m man Mesut Ozil will benefit from having runners in Sanchez and Theo Walcott . Happy again: Ozil has shown what he is capable of at the World Cup with Germany . Confident: Theo Walcott's encouraging run of form was cut short by injury last season, but he's recovering now . Injury free: Aaron Ramsey will be keen to shine once again this season . See you soon: Mathieu Debuchy will be a £10m replacement for Bacary Sagna at right-back . Arsenal's new-found solidity last season (taking away the demolitions at Anfield, Stamford Bridge and the Etihad Stadium) had the look of a title-winning system, though surprisingly the team were let down by goals. It's safe to say that should not happen this year... Mathieu Debuchy will be confirmed as Bacary Sagna's £10m replacement, giving Wenger a proven right-back capable of stepping up to the first team immediately. Mikel Arteta was often the scapegoat in poor away performances, and Arsenal are looking to strengthen that midfield area. Sami Khedira and the Bender brothers have been linked but Morgan Schneiderlin would be a more-than adequate signing to bolster Arsenal's spine. The Southampton man is eager to get away from a side who are selling the majority of their key players. One point which is often brought up to reference Arsenal's failures in years gone by is lack of strength, both mentally and physically. But this squad would have the experience and sheer size to challenge on all fronts. The Puma kit launch on Thursday stressed the message; Future, Forever, Victorious. Something just feels right. Strong: Morgan Schneiderlin could bolster Arsenal's spine . Believe: Arteta, Giroud and Cazorla are depicted in front of the London eye . Tear jerker: Arsene Wenger gave an inspiration speech for the Puma kit launch on Thursday . Away kit launch: But Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will find it tough to break into the starting eleven this season . Midfield options: Jack Wilshere will be looking to turn potential into consistency . With all these impressive changes going on in North London, it may be hard for young England stars Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to make a permanent impression on the first team. Both were affected by injuries last season, and will have been looking to kick on as they turn teenage stardom into consistency on the pitch. Saying that, they certainly have the potential to make an impact from the bench, as well as Lukas Podolski. Santi Cazorla will be another key member of the squad at the Emirates, though the 29-year-old misses out here due to the thought of Sanchez and Walcott racing through on goal from the flanks, The Spaniard is also linked with a move back to his homeland. Unveiled: But Santi Cazorla has been linked with a return to Spain this summer . In today, gone tomorrow? Thomas Vermaelen is expected to leave the club this summer . Abject: There were too many horror shows away from home last season . The early transfer window movement is already triggering thoughts of an intriguing title race. Liverpool (who were beaten to the signing of Sanchez), though selling Luis Suarez, have strengthened their squad in Emre Can and Adam Lallana. Manchester United are building a new legacy with Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera under Louis van Gaal. Chelsea made the biggest early impact this summer by announcing Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas, but Arsenal may well have trumped them with a signal of intent. Make no mistake, the Gunners are in the hunt this year. And don't be surprised to see them end that 10-year wait for a title. Team spirit: Arsenal are looking to bring the good times back to north London . German duo: Lukas Podolski and Per Mertesacker in the new Arsenal kit .

"By . Matt Morlidge . Follow @@MattMorlidge . Petra Kvitova made light work of Eugenie Bouchard on Saturday to win the Wimbledon 2014 women's title. Kvitova won 6-3, 6-0 on Centre Court. Read the report here. Host commentator . The fastest women's Wimbledon final in 31 years, at 55 minutes. That's all from us today, unfortunately it wasn't the competitive final we'd hoped for. Back tomorrow for the men! Bouchard receives a standing ovation, and says: 'I'd like to congratulate Petra she's played fantastic for two weeks. 'Really tough today but I'm proud with how I've played, I love coming here . 'It's a step in the right direction, I don't know if I deserve all your love today but I really appreciate it.' Genie's been Bouchard. Genie's bottled it. No way - Kvitova was just sensational. What a display of hitting from the left-hander. I'm all for competitive finals, but sometimes you just have to applaud a player seizing the opportunity to perform at the very highest level. An extraordinary display. Both players have left the court while the roof closes for the presentation ceremony. Where has that Kvitova been hiding since 2011. That was nearly two hours shorter than the Sharapova-Halep French Open final, brilliant from the victor, sobering for Princess Eugenie. One of the best performances in Wimbledon history that, Petra Kvitova absolutely demolishes the helpless Eugenie Bouchard, winning 6-3, 6-0. You've got to hand it to her, that was superb. Up next, the winner's ceremony... The Czech star is on the brink here... Inevitable. Bouchard was up 40-15 up there, but again Kvitova manages to win the game. A winner on the stretch just sums up Eugenie's day. MIKE DICKSON: Frank Lampard having a long chat in the Royal Boks with venerable journalist Max Hastings - something of an odd couple. They are watching a fine display from Kvitova. Bouchard forces Kvitova to deuce, but the Czech again lands her fastest serve at the tournament at 113mph when it matters most. This really could be over soon. Another break for Kvitova, Bouchard just has no answer at the moment. She is pummeling her second serve, and the Czech doesn't look like being broken at the moment... Another comfortable hold for Kvitova, she serves to love. Something drastic has got to happen for this match to change. This final was always going to be about whether Kvitova, who is a wonderfully talented ball striker, would be able to let her talent flow and be free enough from nerves. I think we have the answer – this has been extremely high quality from the Czech and Bouchard has no answer. The Canadian likes to take the ball early and dictate but she has just not had the chance. So far the mental strength of Bouchard has not been allowed to be a factor. Another break of serve for Kvitova, that's three in a row. She's dictating play, with some huge returns. Bouchard's got a huge fight on her hands to get back in this one. Genie breaks back! For the first time in the match the youngster manages to get on top in the rallies, taking full advantage. This is incredible. Another break for Kvitova, who is playing the tennis of her life right now. Nine winners compared to Bouchard's four. More huge serving from Kvitova. Bouchard just can't deal with that first serve at the moment, losing 82% of the time when it's in. Crucial hold for Eugenie - she was down 15-40 but recovers well. Few unforced errors from Bouchard, but she is trailing on winners. While Kvitova is serving so strongly, Bouchard just can't get into the points. Two aces already for the Czech, though Eugenie is trying to attack her second serve. A superb winner on the defensive from Kvitova wins her the game - Bouchard could be in for a long afternoon. Brilliant from the Czech. She is already striking the ball superbly, and three winners in that game is enough to take the early advantage. Can Genie fight back? But Kvitova comes back with a comfortable hold herself, landing her fastest serve of the tournament so far in the process. Vital early hold of serve for Bouchard, that should settle her nerves nicely. A typical powerful forehand beats Kvitova all ends up. Kvitova looking for her second Wimbledon title, while the Canadian is searching for her first (surely of many) Grand Slam. Both have got better and better throughout the tournament, so we're expecting a cracker. Boost for the players! We're expecting them out on Centre Court shortly. While Eugenie Bouchard and Petra Kvitova prepare in the locker room before stepping out onto Centre Court, the men's finalists Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic have already completed practice sessions ahead of their hotly-anticipated clash tomorrow. Federer hit with former player Fabrice ""The Magician"" Santoro in front of a large crowd out on Court 4. Moments ago, I just walked past Federer round the back of the press centre and he could not look more relaxed as he casually strolled towards the broadcast area for pre-final interviews. Laura Robson and Eugenie Bouchard were once so close that the Canadian stayed with Robson at her family home near the All England Club when they played there. As teenagers they dined together every night during overseas tournaments and two years ago made a video featuring tennis stars - including Maria Sharapova - performing Gangnam Style dance moves. But there has been an acrimonious falling out. Asked on Friday if they were still close, Bouchard responded bluntly: ‘No. I don’t think so,’ adding ‘I’m sure you guys can figure out that one... I’ll leave it at that.’ Princess Eugenie was expected at Wimbledon on Saturday to watch from the Royal Box as Eugenie Bouchard, the Canadian tennis player named after her, contested the women's singles final. Other guests included the Duke of Kent, last year's women's champion Marion Bartoli, England footballer Frank Lampard, the actress Keira Knightley, Sports Minister Helen Grant, American golfer Jack Nicklaus and Britain's last women's singles winner at Wimbledon, Virginia Wade. But we still have a fine day at Wimbledon coming up for you. 20-year-old Eugenie Bouchard has done so well to make it this far, but she has quite a task on her hands in the final. Petra Kvitova is up next, with the match due to start (perhaps under the roof) at 2pm.","Kvitova beats Bouchard in straight sets, 6-3, 6-0 .

Following the previous disappointments of finishing runners-up to Brazil in the 2002 World Cup final and Spain in the 2008 European Championship final, Germany became the first European side to win the biggest prize on South American soil. They were, by popular consensus, the best team on show in Brazil and sent shockwaves through world football with their astonishing 7-1 rout of the hosts in the semi-final. Chancellor Angela Merkel was present at the Maracana to see the team crowned champions and she embraced each of the players in turn as they walked up to collect their medals.

QPR manager Harry Redknapp says the club are building for a season with striker Loic Remy, despite the Frenchman coming close to a move to Liverpool last month. Redknapp was in dire need of the 27-year-old in front of goal during Saturday's 1-0 friendly defeat to PAOK at Loftus Road, the Hoops taking 70 minutes to test the opposition goalkeeper.

Despite pre-season spirits being higher than they should be - testament to an honest support whose expectations have sadly dropped to an all-time low – Villa are sixth favourites to be relegated from the Premier League for the first time. In truth, that’s generous. Five years ago, Europa League was a prerequisite at Villa Park. Now, the only desire is to stay alive while hoping the club is sold before long. VIDEO Scroll down to watch new signing Joe Cole perform an impresive freestyle trick . Worry: Villa have been ever-presents in the Premier League, but they are 3-1 to get relegated . Last chance: Manager Paul Lambert is heading into his third season as Villa boss after two disappointing campaigns . What’s going against Villa? A wantaway owner who can’t find a buyer despite lowering the asking price. A manager nobody wants but with no alternative. Three consecutive seasons of failing to muster up more than 41 points. Three signings you’d be pleased with on the 2004 version of Championship Manager. Just 15 Premier League home wins out of a possible 57. And Roy Keane is now involved to help steady the ship. Their last three top flight finishes – 16th, 15th and 15th – suggests this could be the year. What’s going for Aston Villa? History… and optimism. The last two factors do count for something. If Villa are to attract a buyer – at the £150million asking price or below – the club’s proud past is a selling point. After all, that’s what brought Randy Lerner to the Midlands in the first place (Villa finished 16th the season before the American’s arrival); the 26 consecutive years of top flight football and wide fan base does help. More importantly, optimism and positivity . may see Villa through a fifth straight relegation dog fight. Whether . it's token pre-season hope or real evidence of a change in fortunes on . the horizon, Villa fans realise they desperately need to get behind the . team again for a make-or-break season. Helping hand? Former Sunderland and Ipswich boss Roy Keane has been brought in as Lambert's assistant . The murmurs of discontent have calmed somewhat as we approach the equivalent of Villa's D-Day, drawn out over 38 games. But the events of the summer have done little to convince us the club's ever-present Premier League tag will keep for another season. The signings . Paul Lambert finally gave in to fans’ cries when things got desperate last year by admitting the club needed experience, six months and a transfer window after the Holte End had made that very observation. Lambert moved quick this summer to bring in Philippe Senderos (29), Kieran Richardson (29) and Joe Cole (32). Experience box ticked in one swoop. All three have something to prove, but hardly set fans' imagination alight. Know-how: Lambert needed experience, and brought in 29-year-olds Richardson (left) and Senderos (right) If all three had signed for a Championship side this summer, you wouldn't bat an eyelid. Cole in particular has bags of experience, but struggled in the Premier League even during his romantic return to West Ham. His injury problems are a whole other issue - exactly what Villa don't need. Senderos is back-up and Richardson could prove handy, but Villa's exit door is still open, with the futures of Fabian Delph and Ron Vlaar still uncertain. There is a real possibility the team could be in worse shape than 12 months ago come September 2. Something to prove: At 32, Joe Cole has been given another chance in the Premier League . The manager . Hands tied? Yes. A sticky situation? Certainly. But Lambert hasn't helped himself. Home form must improve, and the criticisms of the Scot's lack of tactical awareness have been loud and understandable. This transfer window has been the polar opposite to his four previous, where Villa took gambles on youth. In drastically changing, Lambert has admitted his previous faults in the market, and knows this is his final chance. It's third time lucky in what should be his third and final season at Villa. Underperformed: Villa have won just 11 home league games under Lambert, finishing 15th twice . The assistant manager . Roy Keane has the potential to destroy morale as quickly as he raises it. Appointing the Irishman was Villa's riskiest move of the summer but the fear should give certain players a lift and separate the men from the boys. Delph and Ashley Westwood could also learn a thing or two from one of the greatest central midfielders to have graced the game. But it is widely assumed, and rightly so, that if Lambert is sacked at some point during the season, Keane will take over. Again, that appointment could go either way. Learn from the best: Fabian Delph (left) and Ashley Westwood (right) could prosper under Keane's influence . I'm next: Keane is Villa's realistic replacement if Lambert loses him job during the course of the season . The owner . When Villa were put on the market in May, it was naive to expect a quick takeover before the new season. Attaining a club is more than a swing by the corner shop. But Lerner can't even get out of the front door and pass the first hurdle; finding a suitable buyer. Lerner wishes to hand over the club to a chairman with the same intentions as himself; healthy, sustainable investment without ruining the identity of the club. Patience is key here, but if another six months passes with no movement, the American may sell to anybody. Attractive: Villa's proud history and tradition should entice buyers, but that hasn't been the case as yet . Flog it: Randy Lerner has struggled to find a suitable buyer for the club, despite reducing the asking price . The bomb squad . Darren Bent, Alan Hutton and Charles N'Zogbia are back in the fold after being all but ignored by Lambert. Villa are desperate, and the experience of the three - whose transfer fees total £38m - is something the Scot sees as beneficial to a young squad. He even allowed Shay Given to become his right-hand man towards the end of last season, despite the Irish goalkeeper earlier admitting the club previously wanted him out the door.

"By . Gerard Brand . Follow @@gedbrand10 . The nation hasn't reached a major tournament since 1976, but the Welsh finally have something to shout about with countryman Gareth Bale reaching the Champions League final on Tuesday night. Barring injury, Bale will become only the fifth Welshman to play on the grandest stage of European football after Real Madrid came through 5-0 on aggregate against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena. Madrid can win their 10th European Cup in Lisbon, but will the Welshman shine? Here's how the others fared... Off to Lisbon: Bale (third right) celebrates after Real Madrid's first goal in Munich on Tuesday night . Terry Yorath - Leeds United, 1975 . The Cardiff-born midfielder was in Jimmy Armfield's XI for the defeat by Bayern Munich in Paris in 1975, and it didn't take long for him to make his stamp on the game. With the sort of challenge which would have you sent off four times over these days, Yorath's fourth-minute attack on Bjorn Andersson was described by Uli Hoeness as 'the most brutal foul I think I have ever seen. His leg was a mess, and it was eight or nine months before he could play again.' Leeds lost 2-0 despite dominating the match, thanks to late goals from Franz Roth and Gerd Muller. Stamp: Yorath made his impact in the game early on with a thumping challenge on Bjorn Andersson . Ian Rush - Liverpool, 1984, 1985 . The deadly finisher was a winner in 1984 as Liverpool beat Roma on their own turf on penalties, with Rush slotting home Liverpool's third spot kick in a 4-2 shoot-out win. He was part of the team that won the 1981 final against Real Madrid in Paris, but never made it into the match-day squad. He played in the 1985 final in Heysel against Juventus, remembered for the 39 people killed by a collapsed concrete wall after trouble in the ground. He went to Juve in search of more of the same with English clubs banned from European competition after Heysel, but returned after just a season. Victory: Rush (back row, second right) celebrates Liverpool's 1984 European Cup final win over Roma . Ryan Giggs - Manchester United, 1999, 2008, 2009 and 2011 . The most decorated Welsh player of all time, the legend played a big part in both of Manchester United's Champions League final wins, and both were as dramatic as they come. The wing wizard helped United get to the final with goals against Juventus in the semi-final and three goals in the group stage, but it was his mishit in the final minutes at the Nou Camp against Bayern Munich that lives longest in the memory. His hashed effort fell to Teddy Sheringham, who equalised for United before Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's winner. In 2008, he scored United's sixth penalty in a 6-5 shoot-out win over Chelsea in Moscow, coming on as a substitute in the 87th minute. He lifted the trophy alongside Rio Ferdinand. Barcelona became his nemesis, losing in the final in Rome in 2009 and then Wembley in 2011. Night to remember: Giggs holds the trophy aloft with Ferdinand after his second Champions League triumph . Joey Jones - Liverpool, 1977 . A two-time winner alongside Ryan Giggs, Jones was victorious in consecutive years with Liverpool in the late 70s. Jones started at left-back in the Reds' 3-1 win over Borussia Monchengladbach in 1977 in Rome, but was on the bench for the 1-0 win over Club Brugge the following year at Wembley. A memorable banner was unfurled by Liverpool supporters in Rome read 'Joey Ate The Frogs Legs, Made The Swiss Roll, Now He's Munching Gladbach' in reference to beating St Etienne and Zurich on their way to the final. Jubilant: Jones celebrates the 3-1 win over Borussia Monchengladbach in Rome . Gareth Bale - Real Madrid . Could he be the best? He has a long way to go to catch up with Giggs in terms of medals, but Bale could easily surpass his Champions League haul if this becomes the Real Madrid side that finally lives up to expectations in Europe. He's scored five goals in Europe this term, and having scored the winner in the Copa del Rey earlier this month, the next step up is to grab the all-important goal in Lisbon. The stage is set for the most expensive player on earth. At last: Bale (background) could be part of a Real Madrid side winning their first Champions League in 12 years .","Gareth Bale's Real Madrid take on Atletico Madrid in the UEFA Champions League final in Lisbon .

"By . Dominic King for Daily Mail . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . Brendan Rodgers believes Raheem Sterling will have teams running scared this season as he tipped the England winger to maintain his relentless progress. The 19-year-old has thrived under Rodgers' guidance and, given his sparkling pre-season form, he has already been installed as one of the favourites to win the PFA Young Player of the Year award next April. Sterling was one of the few England players to emerge from the World Cup finals with his reputation intact and he will be at the forefront for Rodgers in the forthcoming campaign, charged with the task of keeping Liverpool on the front foot after the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona. Talent: Brendan Rodgers believes Raheem Sterling will continue his rapid rise to the top . Diminutive: Sterling earned rave reviews for a series of scintillating displays for the Reds last season . Rodgers said after Liverpool had beaten Borussia Dortmund 4-0 on Sunday that Sterling could 'become anything he wants to be' and he has expanded on the point, claiming he is now playing with such swagger and confidence that teams will be forced to make special plans to deal with him. 'Something we said to Raheem when he first broke into the team and something we've reiterated is that you have to have an identity as a player,' Rodgers explained. 'His identity is he has to score goals and create goals – that's what the job is. 'He scored 10 goals last year and this kid is only going to get better. You look at one of the goals he scored against Manchester City (in New York) – he cushioned it and then the finish – how many times have we seen (Lionel) Messi produce a touch like that? Taking it through bodies and when it's so tight in the box. 'The great thing with watching him now is that he gets you off your seat. When he gets the ball you think 'something could happen here'. There was a moment against Manchester City when he had (Gael) Clichy, (Jesus) Navas and another midfielder coming back to press him and block the space. 'So for teams to have that fear of him as a young shows his development. There is still work for him to do, but he knows that and is a really good boy who is developing really well.' It hasn't always been this way between Rodgers and Sterling. During the manager' s first summer in charge, there was the need for tough love and again last season, when he had two court appearances to contend with. The penny, however, has dropped since Sterling was made a fixture in Liverpool' s starting line-up and Rodgers is delighted that he is working with a more mature professional, one who knows what is expected of him. 'When you're so young, it's important to understand exactly what your role is,' said Rodgers. 'It's not just about looking good, you have to be efficient and effective. His development has gone to a new level. He's way above the level from when he first came in. Wing wizard: Sterling has forged a reputation as one of the top wingers in England . 'Tactically, technically, and what has been beautiful to watch with Raheem has been his maturity and he's turning into a beautiful young man, with all the responsibility. 'Raheem is taking it all in his stride and now he's in a good place with every part of his game. It's just about maintaining that commitment to his work. He's still only 19, but in big games he's performed and he's a wonderful talent.' Adam Lallana is also on course to return to action at the start of next month after clearing a significant hurdle in his rehabilitation. The England international suffered knee ligament damage during Liverpool's tour of the United States three weeks ago but he has been given the green light to start running again at the club's Melwood training base. Lallana was initially ruled out for six weeks but he has been working hard cut the time he is on the sidelines. If, for instance, he was fit to be included in Liverpool's trip to Tottenham on August 31, he may yet be fit enough to figure in Roy Hodgson's plans for the games with Norway and Switzerland. Liverpool, however, will not rush him and it seems most likely that he will be available for the game against Aston Villa on September 13.","Rodgers is backing the 19-year-old to continue his fine form for Liverpool .

The Eredivisie side dispute Swansea’s claim that Vorm was signed by Spurs on a free transfer and insist they are owed 30 per cent of whatever the Welsh club received, in line with a sell-on clause inserted in the deal when the goalkeeper arrived at the Liberty Stadium from Utrecht in 2011.

He told me that they let him go for free. That’s unbelievable and unacceptable. He is 30 years old, in the prime of his life. He still had a two-year contract and has a good reputation. Besides that he’s a solid member of the Dutch squad. ‘Everyone knows that Michel wasn’t sold for zero pounds. That money went somewhere. We want to know where. ‘We have brought this transfer to the FIFA.’ Swansea insisted last week that they will make no further comment on the subject after denying they had a case to answer. They said the deal was ‘conducted and concluded correctly’ and ‘approved by the Premier League and also FIFA via their TMS system’.

"By . Gerard Brand . Follow @@gedbrand10 . Brazil's 7-1 defeat by Germany will be remembered for several reasons. A nation being dismantled on the biggest stage in their own backyard will override most. But one man who may be overlooked in the hysteria is Joachim Low, the leader of the rout. Brazil were depleted without Neymar and Thiago Silva, but Low still masterminded a demolition that, if any sympathy you have for Brazil is overlooked, was as impressive as it was ruthless. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Andre Schurrle and Kevin Grosskruetz celebrating . Cool and calm: Low (centre, right) hugs Scolari after the incredible win in Belo Horizonte . Goals galore: Toni Kroos (right) celebrates after scoring Germany's third . Put on the spot at both half-time and full-time, BBC's Alan Shearer criticised Brazil and praised Germany in equal measure, a direction some pundits dodged. He was spot on. So, who is Joachim Low? Eight years has told us a lot, but Low continues to grow as a manager. Appearances in a World Cup final and semi-final, plus a European Championship final and semi-final tells us he is consistent. Not surprising. He has built a model for Germany that can be recycled for years to come. The talent pool is huge, but Low does not rest believing the talent alone will prevail. Low is a believer in the German players being individually suited to his style, not shoehorning eleven players into positions based on their club performances. Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola was paid a huge . compliment when Low attempted to use Philipp Lahm in midfield during the . group stages, the Spaniard's preferred position for one of the best full-backs we have ever seen.

Lahm went back to full-back and they overcame France in the quarter-finals despite some doubters. There . is more to the 54-year-old than reliability. He is a likeable character . who stands by his tactical decisions with an air of confidence that on . Tuesday night shone through to his players. Like so many great managers, his playing career comes second to his coaching achievements. An attacking midfielder, he appeared for . West Germany's U21 side four times, and had difficulties settling into . any German side, leaving Freiburg in 1980 only to return twice. Mentor: Low was Jurgen Klinsmann's assistant for two years between 2004 and 2006 . Big call: Low made the decision to push Lahm back to full-back for the quarter-final against France . Low's real talents were with coaching, and after a short spell as manager with FC Frauenfeld he became Stuttgart assistant and then boss. Two . successful years with Stuttgart culminated in a 1-0 defeat to Chelsea . in the European Cup Winners Cup final in 1998, before an unsuccessful . year-long spell Fenerbahce. Several years in limbo ended when . Jurgen Klinsmann brought Low in as his assistant with Germany in 2004 . following a poor European Championship campaign.

Low is a motivator and a tactician, leaving no stone unturned while preventing Germany from becoming running robots. The speed in which they attacked when winning the ball in Belo Horizonte will strike fear into both Argentina and Holland. Germany must be favourites. And don't forget, they are doing this without their star man, Marco Reus. Low is already one of the longest-serving managers in football today. A World Cup win would surely give him another four years at least, if he wants them.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles is investigating a possible security breach of its credit card processing services, but its internal computer system does not appear to have been accessed, a spokesman said on Saturday. The disclosure by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in the nation's most populous state comes at a time of heightened concern about data breaches following revelations of a massive theft of payment card records from Target Corp. ‘The Department of Motor Vehicles has been alerted by law enforcement authorities to a potential security issue within its credit card processing services,’ spokesman Armando Botello said in a statement. The California Department of Motor Vehicles is investigating a possible security breach of its credit card processing services . He added that the agency has opened an investigation ‘out of an abundance of caution’ along with federal and state law enforcement agencies. The DMV allows clients to pay by credit card in online transactions and at self-service terminals at some locations, for transactions such as renewing driver's licenses and vehicle registrations, Botello said in a phone interview. He declined to release other details about the potential breach, including how many customers might have had their data compromised and the time frame when it might have occurred. There is no evidence of a direct breach of the DMV's computer system, Botello said in the statement. The potentially compromised transactions may have occurred between August 2 and January 31 and the data that may have been stolen could include credit card numbers, expiration dates and three-digit security codes . ‘In its investigation, the department is performing a forensic review of its systems and seeking information regarding any potential breach from both the external vendor that processes the DMV's credit card transactions and the credit card companies themselves,’ the statement said. The blog Krebs on Security first reported the suspected data breach, citing unnamed sources at financial institutions. It said the potentially compromised transactions occurred between August 2 and January 31 and the data that may have been stolen could include credit card numbers, expiration dates and three-digit security codes. Representatives from MasterCard Inc, Visa Inc, American Express Co and Discover Financial Services could not immediately be reached for comment. MasterCard spokesman Seith Eisen told the Los Angeles Times the credit card company is ""aware of and investigating"" reports of a potential breach involving the California DMV. The DMV revelations come at a time of heightened concern about data breaches following revelations of a massive theft of payment card records from Target Corp . Last year, some 40 million payment card records were stolen from retailer Target, and Congress is investigating the breach along with lapses at other retailers. Credit card companies have pushed for better security. Earlier this year, upscale retailer Neiman Marcus said a data breach potentially exposed payment card information at 77 of its 85 stores between last July and October.","California Department of Motor Vehicles is investigating a possible security breach of its credit card processing services .

"By . Meghan Keneally . and Reuters Reporter . Experts have determined the disease that has brought Florida orange production to its lowest levels in 30 years and led to a massive price spike throughout the country. A gnat-sized bug called the Asian citrus psyllid is believed to be the insect spreading the deadly bacteria that has cut the state's production dramatically. The gnat is not the only problem facing the plants, as citrus greening disease and an unexpectedly harsh winter posed their own problems for the crop. Lower production: A combination of a new strand of bacteria, a brutally cold winter and other standard threats have led the Department of Agriculture to set lower production targets for Florida's orange crop in coming years . Farmers don't know what to do to fix the issue, as they have kept on check with insecticide and mineral treatments in the soil. Harder work: Farmers are trying their best to fight off the bacteria by being diligent with their use of insecticide but that isn't enough . 'We spray at least every four weeks... but we are not keeping pace with the spread,' said Ellis Hunt, a family farmer whose 5,000 acres near Lake Wales have been struck by the spreading disease. 'It feels we are losing the fight,' he told the AFP. As a result, American orange juice prices hit two-year highs last week after a government crop report trimmed last month's forecasts for production and yield from Florida. The U.S. Department of Agriculture cut its latest estimates for Florida's orange output and yield in a report issued after one of the most brutal winters in decades. Florida's orange output for 2013/14 had been reduced to 110 million boxes from a previous forecast of 114 boxes in March, the USDA said. 'The Florida all orange forecast, at 110 million boxes (4.95 million tons), is down 4 percent from the previous forecast and down 18 per cent from last season's final utilization,' it said. Yields for frozen concentrated orange juice were revised to an estimated 1.6 gallons a box, from last month's forecast of 1.61 gallons. The yields were 'down 1 per cent from the March forecast but up 1 per cent from last season's final yield of 1.59 gallons per box,' it added. Backlash: As a result of lower production, American orange juice prices hit two-year highs last week . Adding to farmer's problems is the fact that orange juice consumption has dropped by 30 per cent since 2003 as a result of the growing number of drink options available and the growing tendancy to skip breakfast. 'Juice is often associated with breakfast and as our society changes, we rush ourselves a little bit and we have a tendency to skip it,' said Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services official Daniel Sleep.","A gnat-sized insect is spreading a rare bacteria throughout Florida's orange farms .

"By . Reuters Reporter . Suntory Holdings Ltd on Monday said it would buy U.S. spirits company Beam Inc for $13.6 billion cash in a deal that would make the Japanese company the world's third-largest spirits maker. Including the assumption of Beam's net debt, the deal is valued at $16 billion. It brings together Beam's Jim Beam and Maker's Mark bourbons, Courvoisier cognac and Sauza tequila with Suntory's Yamazaki, Hakushu, Hibiki and Kakubin Japanese whiskies, Bowmore Scotch whisky and Midori liqueur. Once the acquisition is completed, Suntory will become the third largest whiskey company and the fifth largest malt whiskey company by volume, according to International Wine & Spirit Research. Illinois-based Beam Inc. will be purchased by Japanese powerhouse Suntory Holdings for $16billion . The deal is the latest example of how Japanese beverage companies are seeking to quench their thirst for overseas growth as the population in their home market shrinks. 'All Japanese beverage companies have been focused on getting growth outside Japan,' said Bernstein Research analyst Trevor Stirling. The deal boosts Suntory's market share in the U.S. to 11 percent from less than 1 percent, according to Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg. The proposed acquisition is also Japan's third-largest announced outbound deal of all time, according to Thomson Reuters data. Last year, privately held Suntory floated its food and non-alcoholic drinks company, Suntory Beverage & Food, to raise money for overseas acquisitions. Kirin Holdings Co bought control of Brazil's Schincariol for $2.6 billion in 2011, and Asahi Group Holdings took a stake in Chinese brewery Tsingtao in 2009. Jim Beam is one of the best-selling and most-recognizable brands of bourbon - a uniquely American spirit - in the world . ACKMAN WINS BIG . One of the biggest winners in the Suntory deal will be Pershing Square Capital Management. The $12 billion hedge fund owned by William Ackman owned 12.8 percent, or 20.8 million shares, of Beam at the end of the third quarter. At that time, Beam was Pershing's third-biggest position, and it has helped boost the hedge fund's performance in a year overshadowed by a $500 million loss on J.C. Penney Co Inc and climbing losses on Herbalife Ltd. Pershing Square first invested in Fortune Brands in October 2010. The company then sold its golf business, which included Titleist golf balls, and spun off its home supply products including faucet maker Moen and MasterBrand Cabinet. The name of the remaining company was then changed to Beam. Ackman declined to comment on the deal with Suntory. Suntory said on Monday that it would pay $83.50 per share in cash, a 25 percent premium to Beam's closing stock price of $66.97 on Friday. Beam shares closed up 24.6 percent at $83.42 on Monday. The purchase price is more than 20 times Beam's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, a multiple that comes close to the record 20.8 times EBITDA that Pernod Ricard paid in 2008 for the maker of Absolut vodka. Suntory Holdings will become the third-largest spirits company in the world after the deal comes through . But unlike the Absolut acquisition, there are few cost-saving opportunities in Monday's deal, Stirling said, since more than 90 percent of Suntory's business is in Japan, and the Beam business will continue to operate in the United States. If the deal falls through, Beam must pay Suntory a $425 million termination fee. The deal between Suntory and Beam came together quickly - in less than two months, according to a person close to the transaction. Analysts believe a counterbid by the likes of larger rivals Diageo Plc or Pernod is unlikely, citing the deal's high multiple, termination fee and approval by both boards. Suntory already distributes Beam products in Japan, and Beam distributes Suntory's products in Singapore and other Asian markets. Suntory already has a portfolio of Japanese whiskies and one Scotch that are strong in its home market, but the acquisition of Beam gives it bourbon, Scotch, Irish and Canadian whiskies and access to a stronger distribution network not just in the U.S. but in key emerging markets such as India, Russia and Brazil. The combined company will have annual sales of about $4.3 billion. Beam has been viewed as an attractive takeover target since becoming a stand-alone public spirits company in October 2011. Analysts and bankers long speculated that its range of bourbons would fit nicely into Diageo's portfolio, which has many Scotch whiskies but only one bourbon. So-called brown spirits, like whiskey, have experienced a resurgence in recent years, helped by the growing popularity of classic cocktails. U.S. sales volume of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey have grown 13.2 percent in the five years to 2012, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. Super-premium brands have grown nearly 80 percent over the same period. Suntory intends to fund the acquisition with cash on hand and fully committed financing from Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Financial advisers in the deal are Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley for Suntory and Centerview Partners and Credit Suisse for Beam. Legal advisers are Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP for Suntory and Sidley Austin LLP for Beam.","Suntory acquires historic bourbon maker for $13.6billion cash and assumes $2.4billion in debt .

"By . David Mccormack . and Reuters Reporter . U.S. health regulators have recommended that healthcare professionals stop prescribing combination drugs that contain more than 325 milligrams of acetaminophen per tablet, capsule, or other dosage unit, citing the risk of liver damage. One of the most commonly used drugs in the country, acetaminophen, is widely used in both prescription and over-the-counter products to reduce pain and fever. Limiting the quantity per dosage unit will reduce the risk of inadvertent overdose, which can lead to liver failure, liver transplant and death, said the Food and Drug Administration. U.S. health regulators have recommended that healthcare professionals stop prescribing combination drugs that contain more than 325 milligrams of acetaminophen including Panadol . It cited the fact that no available data . showed that taking more than the recommended dose provided benefits . that outweighed the added risks. Inadvertent overdose from combination drugs containing acetaminophen - known as paracetamol in other countries - accounts for nearly half of all cases of acetaminophen-related liver failure in the United States, the agency said. 'Acetaminophen overdose is one of the most common poisonings worldwide,' according to the National Institutes of Health. Combination acetaminophen products are commonly prescribed to patients to treat pain from acute injuries, post-operative pain, or pain following dental procedures. Acetaminophen is widely used in both prescription and over-the-counter products to reduce pain and fever . It is commonly used in pain . medications with opioids such as oxycodone (Percocet), hydrocodone . (Vicodin) and codeine (Tylenol with Codeine). In January 2011, the FDA asked manufacturers of combination drugs containing acetaminophen, sold globally under trade names such as Tylenol and Panadol, to limit acetaminophen doses to no more than 325 mg in each tablet or capsule by January 14, 2014. Some of these products still remain available, the agency said. The FDA also suggested that pharmacists who receive a prescription for a combination product with more than the recommended dose contact the prescriber to discuss using a lower dose. In the near future, the FDA plans to institute proceedings to withdraw approval for combination drugs that remain on the market, it said in a statement. The FDA has set the recommended maximum for adults at 4,000 milligrams per day, but it is easier to reach this limit than you might think - with a single gel tablet of Extra Strength Tylenol containing 500 mg. Consumers should not take more than the prescribed dose of any medication that contains acetaminophen, according to the FDA, and should avoid taking more than one acetaminophen product at a time. Drinking alcohol while taking acetaminophen also puts you at risk. The warning does not apply to over-the-counter drugs such as Tylenol, which contains acetaminophen. The FDA said it will address these products in another regulatory action.","Acetaminophen is widely used in both prescription and over-the-counter products to reduce pain and fever .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Reuters Reporter . Microsoft Corp said on Thursday it had disrupted the largest network of compromised personal computers, involving some 2 million machines around the world, since it stepped up its battle against organized online criminals three years ago. The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant filed a lawsuit in Texas and won a judge's order directing Internet service providers to block all traffic to 18 Internet addresses that were used to direct fraudulent activity to the infected machines. Law enforcement in many European countries served warrants at the same time, seizing servers expected to contain more evidence about the leaders of the ZeroAccess crime ring, which was devoted to ‘click fraud’. Put a spanner in the works: Microsoft Corp says it has disrupted the largest network of compromised personal computers, involving some 2 million machines around the world . Such rings use networks of captive machines, known as botnets, in complicated schemes that force them to click on ads without the computer owners' knowledge. The schemes cheat advertisers on search engines including Microsoft's Bing by making them pay for interactions that have no chance of leading to a sale. Microsoft said the botnet had been costing advertisers on Bing, Google Inc and Yahoo Inc an estimated $2.7 million monthly. The coordinated effort marks the eighth time Microsoft has moved against a botnet and a rare instance of it doing serious damage to one that is controlled with a peer-to-peer mechanism, where infected machines give each other instructions instead of relying on a central server that defenders can hunt down and disable. Complicated schemes: Crime rings, such as ZeroAccess, use networks of captive machines, known as botnets, that force the PC to click on ads without the computer owners' knowledge . But the ZeroAccess botnet still had a weakness: The code in the infected machines told them to reach out to one of the 18 numeric Internet addresses for details on which ads to click. Microsoft recently opened a new Cybercrime Center in Redmond and is using new tools in its efforts. They are helped by a provision in trademark that allows pretrial seizure of suspected counterfeit goods, including websites that, as in the present case, are spreading tainted versions of the Internet Explorer browser. The company is working with national computer security authorities in various countries and with Internet service providers to notify individual computer owners with infected machines, hoping to reach most of them before the fraudsters can spread new instructions. Good news: Richard Boscovich, assistant general council for the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit, says the fraud by the ZeroAccess botnet network has been stopped, for now . Microsoft has been sharing evidence with the FBI and Europol, the continent's law enforcement coordinating service. National agencies took part in seizure actions in Germany, Switzerland, Latvia, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. For now, at least, the fraud by this network has stopped, said Microsoft Assistant General Counsel Richard Boscovich. The operators of the botnet are believed to be in Russia, while the author of the malicious software distributed on it could be based elsewhere, Boscovich said.","Microsoft Corp said Thursday it had disrupted the network of some 2 million compromised personal computers around the world in its three-year battle .

"By . Reuters Reporter . Videogame maker King, creator of the Candy Crush Saga, a game that has millions of fans around the world, said on Tuesday it had trademarked the word 'candy' to protect the game from persistent intellectual property infringements. Created in 2003, King has experienced an explosion in popularity since launching on Facebook in 2011 with its saga games, in which players move through a competitive landscape and pass their friends on the way. Candy Crush Saga was the top downloaded free app for 2013, and the year's top revenue grossing app. It has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch in 2012. Incredibly popular: Candy Crush is the most-downloaded game in the world with over 500million users - and hundreds of imitators . The company now says it wants to protect its game title from imitators who also use the word 'candy.' It has obtained a trademark from the European Union, which will apply not only to computer games, but also to areas such as clothes and footwear, the European Commission's trademark office told Reuters. 'We don't enforce against all uses of ""candy"" - some are legitimate and of course, we would not ask app developers who use the term legitimately to stop doing so,' King spokesman Martin Bunge-Meyer said. King is still waiting approval for a similar trademark in the United States, Bunge-Meyer added. King's games appeal to a growing trend for players, more and more of them female, to play puzzle games with their friends in short bursts, especially as games are increasingly played on the move on phones or tablets to kill spare minutes.","Candy Crush Saga was the most-downloaded game in the world last year .

"By . Reuters Reporter . and Associated Press . US regulators are crafting a rule that would require all new vehicles to be able to 'talk' to one another using wireless technology, which the Department of Transportation said would significantly reduce accidents on the  roads and alleviate traffic congestion. A rule mandating so-called vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology should be put in place before President Barack Obama leaves office in early 2017, DOT officials said on Monday. A radio beacon would continually transmit a vehicle's position, heading, speed and other information. Cars would receive the same information back from other vehicles, and a vehicle's computer would alert the driver to an impending collision. Some systems may automatically brake to avoid an accident if manufacturers choose to include that option. Acting National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Administrator David Friedman (right) and Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx (left) announced the tracking program today . The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has been working with automakers on the technology for the past decade, estimates vehicle-to-vehicle communications could prevent up to 80 percent of accidents that don't involve drunken drivers or mechanical failure. 'When these technologies are adapted across the fleet, the results could be nothing short of revolutionary for roadway safety,' said David Friedman, acting administrator of the DOT's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The details of implementation are still unknown. Mandating the use of technology once thought to be science-fiction will 'pave the way for market penetration of vehicle-to-vehicle safety applications,' the DOT said in a statement. This 'V2V' technology allows cars on the road to trade basic safety data, such as speed and position, at a rate of ten times per second. This exchange of information might help avoid or reduce the severity of 80 percent of crashes that occur when the driver is not impaired, NHTSA said. ""Think of all the everyday situations that this technology could help with; when folks pull up to a four-way stop, driving behind a big truck or an SUV that limits your visibility or even making a lane change and a car moves into your blind spot,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told a news conference. The tracking system, which allows other cars to communicate with your vehicle, could prevent gridlock like the kind seen here in Los Angeles . This data does not include personal details about the driver or vehicle, the DOT said. Vehicles or a group of vehicles can be identified through a defined procedure 'only if there is a need to fix a safety problem.' The announcement comes as NHTSA finishes its analysis of data gathered during its year-long pilot program of V2V technology in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In that program, US officials and the University of Michigan outfitted nearly 3,000 cars, trucks and buses with wireless devices that tracked other vehicles' speed and location, and alerted drivers to congestion. Those findings, as well as a preliminary estimate of the costs of this technology, will be published in coming weeks. An industry trade group aligned with auto manufacturers said it is willing to explore the idea but that a lot of questions remain. 'Many pieces of a large puzzle still need to fit together,' said Gloria Bergquist, head of communications for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. 'What remains to be addressed is security and privacy, along with consumer acceptance, affordability, achieving the critical mass to enable the ""network effect"" and establishment of the necessary legal and regulatory framework,' she said. 'Automakers have invested significantly in safety technology and systems, and we will review today's announcement and engage with NHTSA in next steps.'","Department of Transportation is working on the new rule right now .

"By . Reuters Reporter . The agency that oversees development in the San Francisco Bay in California has begun a formal investigation into the construction of a secretive Google Inc barge on an island in the bay. The probe, which began in the past week, will examine what permits are needed to build the barge and whether the owners of the Treasure Island pier where the vessel is moored have the proper permits, said Larry Goldzband, the executive director of the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission. 'We want to make sure that the permits that are used by the owners of the pier actually allowed for construction to happen,' Mr Goldzband told Reuters on Wednesday, referring to what he described as 'a preliminary and formal enforcement investigation.' Under investigation: City officials began looking into the barge's permits after the Coast Guard requested changes to its design . Google officials informed Mr Goldzband in a recent meeting that they are in the process of making changes to the barge's design which have been requested by the U.S. Coast Guard. Jason Tama, a Coast Guard commander, said he could not comment on any specific cases, but noted that it was standard practice for the Coast Guard to inspect new construction to ensure that safety, security and environmental protection regulations are met. Changes to vessels are a common part of the process, he said. Google did not return requests for comment. The barge, which is made of steel shipping containers stacked four-stories high, has stirred intense speculation about its purpose since its existence was first reported in October. Google, the world's No.1 Internet search engine, has kept mum on what it intends to use the barge for. Documents submitted to the Port of San Francisco in August describe an 'artistic' technology exhibition space. Shrouded in mystery: Construction materials are see outside a hanger adjacent to a barge Google had built with four levels of windowed shipping containers at a pier on Treasure Island in San Francisco . A report in the San Francisco Chronicle on Monday, citing documents that Google submitted to barge builder Turner Construction Co, refer to a 'floating retail store.' A floating retail store might raise questions with the conservation and development commission, which issues permits for vessels that are moored in one spot for an extended time. The current investigation is focused on the construction of the barge, rather than its future use. The probe, which should take a few weeks, will look at who owns the pier, who uses it and for what purposes, said Mr Goldzband. Bay Ship and Yacht Co has a lease with Treasure Island for Pier One which ran until November 30, according to documents provided to Reuters by the Treasure Island Development Authority earlier this year. The director of the development authority was not immediately available on Wednesday. Bay Ship and Yacht Co could not immediately be reached for comment. Mr Goldzband would not speculate about what kind of action might result if it was determined that there was a violation, but he said that the commission has the power to levy fines as well as to issue 'cease-and-desist' orders.","Google shrouded the barge in secrecy as it was built earlier this year in San Francisco Bay .

And just over a minute later the Black Cats doubled their advantage after they were awarded a penalty when Vergini was taken down in the area. The impressive Wickham made no mistake from the spot coolly slotting home as they inched ever closer to a second successive pre-season win. The hosts were unfortunate not to receive another spot-kick after Liam Agnew looked to be taken down, before Udinese went on the counter-attack up the other end going close through Luis Muriel - who dragged his shot just wide of the far post.

E-cigarettes are slim, reusable metal tubes that contain nicotine-laced liquid in a variety of exotic flavors such as bubble gum and bacon. As a ""smoker"" puffs on the device, the nicotine is heated and releases a vapor that, unlike cigarette smoke, contains no tar, which is known to cause cancer and other diseases. Critics of the law contend that such a ban would do more harm than good. Richard Carmona, a former U.S. Surgeon General and a current board member at NJOY, one of America's largest electronic cigarette manufacturers, sent a letter to the council recently to urge rejection of the bill. Legacy: Environmental and health legislation championed by Michael Bloomberg, pictured, have been introduced despite him losing office in November . 'I'm extremely concerned that a well-intentioned but scientifically unsupported effort like the current proposal to include electronic cigarettes in New York's current smoking ban, could constitute a giant step backward in the effort to defeat tobacco smoking,' Carmona wrote. The debate over risks versus benefits of e-cigarettes is far from being settled, but a study published recently in the British medical journal, The Lancet, said they are as effective as nicotine patches for smokers trying to kick the habit. Three states - Utah, North Dakota and New Jersey - and Washington, D.C. have already passed legislation banning e-cigarettes wherever smoking is prohibited.","The ban on 'vaping' will go into effect in four months and follows the Bloomberg administration's bans on smoking, trans fat and an attempted ban on large sodas .
The move comes weeks after New York became the first major city to raise the legal age to purchase tobacco to 21 .
Bloomberg's detractors have derided him for trying to impose a 'nanny state' in America's largest city ."

"By . Sean Gallagher . Michael Owen has hailed Steven Gerrard as the second-best player of his generation only bettered by Zinedine Zidane following the Liverpool midfielder's decision to retire from England duty. Owen - who played with Gerrard in Liverpool's first team for six years - believes the 34-year-old can hold his head high after 114 caps and 21 goals for the Three Lions during a 14-year stint. He told Sportlobster: 'In my career I was fortunate to have played alongside some of the greatest footballers of my generation and the biggest compliment I can pay to Stevie is that in my opinion he is second only to Zinedane Zidane in terms of world-class status. Celebrations: Michael Owen wheels away in delight with Steven Gerrard after scoring for England . Quality: The duo formed a great partnership during their time together at Liverpool . 'Rather like when I was considering hanging up my boots, you go through all the pros and cons of staying or going and you consider all the personal and professional hopes and dreams that you’ve held on to for so many years. 'Ultimately you have to make a decision that you feel most comfortable with and one that you hope will be in the best interests of everyone who is likely to affected. All smiles: Gerrard and Owen celebrate League Cup success in 2001 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff . 'In Stevie’s case he obviously feels that it’s time for the younger generation to step forward and quite literally fill his boots at international level. 'Having reached that decision we can only admire his conviction and congratulate him on an international career to be proud of. 'Of course he will have wanted the team to have achieved more at the six major tournaments that he played in, but with 114 caps and 21 goals to his name, not to mention captaining his country on 38 occasions he can be very proud of his achievements.' Owen, who himself made 89 appearances for England, saw he knew instantly when first saw Gerrard play that he was all set to become a star, later forming a formidable partnership with the midfielder at Anfield. 'The first time I saw Stevie play, as an 11-year-old in the Liverpool youth ranks, it was obvious how much ability he possessed and that in all probability he would  become the complete, modern footballer. 'I first met Stevie at Liverpool’s training ground in 1992 when we were on our way through the club’s youth ranks and in those days there was no standing on ceremony when judging talent. 'The Liverpool coaches quite openly put the best players in the same team and as we were considered two of the brightest prospects we’d always be paired together. Memorable: Gerrard scores his first goal for his country in the historic 5-1 win over Germany in Munich . Walking away: Gerrard has called time on a 14-year international career with England . 'I knew very quickly that I was playing alongside someone special. There wasn’t a particular moment of realisation as such. 'With me, I would make a forward run and Stevie would just keep delivering the ball right into my path. That’s how it was with us for the next 20 years at Liverpool and then with England. No-one created more goals for me.' The retired forward also hopes Gerrard's decision to call time on his international career will bring him more success domestically, with the Premier League crown a trophy Gerrard is still desperate to add to his collection. He added: 'I believe that Stevie’s decision to stand down from International duty has in no small part been made with a view to prolonging his career at Liverpool. 'Despite England’s lack of success during his time with them I for one hope that he can add to his already impressive haul with Liverpool by lifting the one piece of domestic silverware that has eluded him thus far.'","Owen believes Gerrard was the second-best player of his generation, only bettered by Zinedine Zidane, following his retirement with England .

He added: 'I spoke to Ryan Giggs, not that I had any doubts, and he told me if he had still been manager this season Rio would have been his number one centre half. 'When he had that spell in charge the first thing he did was put Rio in the team. He was fit all season. It was just a case of David (Moyes) going in and turning a few things around.

At 5ft 8in, she should weigh between 9st and 12st, according to NHS advice. Instead, she is a tiny 4st 3lbs, less than half of what her lightest healthy weight should be. Scroll down to see the interview . Valeria Levitin is a walking skeleton after years of anorexia reduced her weight to just four stone . Valeria aged 19, on holiday in Mexico. She developed the eating disorder as a teenager and has now chosen to speak out about how the illness has ruined her life . What is most worrying is that Valeria, originally from Russia but who now lives in Monaco, says she gets fan mail from girls desperate to copy her skeletal look. The 39-year-old told The Sun: ‘I have received emails from young girls who want me to teach them how to be like me. ‘All the letters I’ve had are from women, mainly in their twenties, who see me as some kind of inspiration.’ As a result, she has taken the brave step to speak out about her condition and campaign against anorexia – and says she refuses to teach young girls how to die. She says she wants to share her story to prevent other people falling victim to the same fate, saying anorexia has made her 'lonely, unattractive and repulsive for the people around me' Valeria, pictured as she is today, was banned from ballet at the age of 24 over concerns she would injure herself as she weighed just six stone .

She . says she wants to share her story to prevent other people falling . victim to the same fate, saying anorexia has made her ‘lonely, . unattractive and repulsive for the people around me’. Valeria, here aged 11, believes the roots of her condition lie with her mother, who was terrified she would grow up obese like her relatives . She believes the roots of her condition lie with her mother, who was terrified Valeria would grow up obese like her relatives. Even as a young child, her diet was curtailed. Hello dear Valeria, . I . am 23 and weigh 8½st and I do not like myself this way. I want to look . skinny like Thumbelina. Nobody can persuade me not to diet, even though I . acquired gastritis and pancreatitis. I . have tried all kinds of diets but they all yielded only temporary . results. On my present diet I do not feel hungry... I cannot return to my old way of eating because I fear I . will gain weight. All my . relatives are telling me it will hurt me, that I will be a victim of . anorexia. I am a little worried that one day I will be faced with a . problem of critically low weight and I want to know when to get worried. When did it happen to you? Valeria was weighed often to ensure she hadn’t gained any weight, such was her mother’s drive for perfection. At 16, and weighing 10st, Valeria moved to Chicago with her parents. Desperate to fit in at a new school, she thought that if she lost weight, she would be accepted and liked. As a result, she restricted her diet even further, cutting out sugar or carbohydrates. The irony today is that, having cut out certain foods for so long, her body is intolerant to them and could not process them even if she wanted to. When a classmate made a cruel comment about Valeria’s figure, she became even more determined to lose weight. She said: 'We were playing football and during the game a man said, ""I know how we can win. We need to put Valeria’s big ar*e in the goal”. It shattered my whole world.' By the time she was 23, Valeria’s dress size had plummeted from a healthy size 12 to a tiny size six. Deciding to become a model made the situation even worse, as she was told she was still too fat to succeed. As her weight continued to plummet, by the age of 24 and weighing just six stone, she was banned from dancing over concerns she would injure herself. It has been so long since Valeria ate bread that she can no longer remember what it tastes like . For the next ten years she saw more than 30 health specialists, though once dipped to a dangerously low 3st 10lbs. Today, even if she wanted to eat certain foods, she would be unable to. Many foods have to be avoided because they don’t agree with her body any more. It has been so long since she ate bread that she can no longer remember what it tastes like. Her illness has also made her life a very lonely one. Single for a decade, she says relationships are difficult as she is unable to do the normal things that couples do, as going to restaurants. Now, she believes she cannot be cured simply by going to a doctor, having never gained weight after seeing a specialist. Aged 23, she decided to become a model, but suffered further set-backs after being told she was too big . Rather, she says the problem is more about a 'lack of harmony between body and . soul'. Today Valeria takes supplements to counter the risk of bruising and avoids situations where she could fall. And . she believes the solution could lie in moving back to Moscow - where . she feels more at ease with herself - and trying to fulfill her lifelong . dream of becoming a mother via a surrogate. For . the incentive of wanting a child could be a trigger to get healthy . again, she says.  It is something she feels she can do if she can get . herself healthy. Now 39, Valeria says she is desperate to get better and fulfill her dream of becoming a mother. She also wants to serve as a warning to others about the dangers of extreme dieting . She said: 'I would love to have a family because I feel I have so much to give. But obviously it wouldn’t be right to have a baby when I am ill. It wouldn’t be fair on the child. 'I want to stand up to anorexia. I’ve never given up on anything in my life and I’m not about to give up now.' Valeria would like people suffering from eating disorders like hers to get help.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The exact science behind how our Milky Way began has baffled astronomers for centuries. But the discovery of a 'baby Milky Way' galaxy called DLA2222-0946 could provide us with the clues we need to reveal the secrets of our own creation. University of Hawaii at Manoa astronomer Dr Regina Jorgenson used the most powerful telescope on Earth to make the discovery that could rewrite the laws of galaxy formation. The galaxy DLA2222-0946, a young version of our Milky Way, was detected by observing its hydrogen emission as shown in this image of a chunk of the galaxy 16,300 light years across . The movement of the gas in the galaxy (red is towards us, blue is away) indicates it is in the early stages of forming a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, which could reveal how our own galaxy formed . The young galaxy was found 10.8 billion light years from Earth using a quasar, a super-heated region of gas and dust around a supermassive black hole, as a reference. The discovery was made using the W. M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, one of the most advanced and powerful telescopes in the world. Thousands of so-called 'damped Lyman-alpha systems' (DLAs) have been found to date, which are galaxies discovered by detecting their influence on nearby objects like quasars. But DLA2222-0946 is the first to be discovered that so closely resembles the same formation process our Milky Way went through several billion years ago, termed a 'baby Milky Way' by Dr Jorgenson. 'It's sort of extraordinary for being ordinary,' said Dr Jorgenson, speaking in Washington D.C. at an American Astronomical Society meeting. How did the Milky Way begin? Observations of galaxies that will ultimately form the same shape as our own could give us the vital clues we need to explain how stars were created in our galaxy . Discoveries of this sort are all the more impressive for their difficulty. Dr Jorgenson likened finding DLA2222-0946 as 'akin to reading the President's newspaper in the White House' from six miles away. She added finding such a galaxy in this stage of its formation 'is something astronomers have been trying to do for over thirty years.' The discovery was made using the W. M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, one of the biggest and most powerful telescopes in the world . The galaxy is so far away that what we are observing now corresponds to a time when the universe was only 20 percent of its current age. Determining how galaxies like this turn their gas and dust into stars is one of the biggest mysteries in the cosmos. Continued studies of DLA2222-0946 could ultimately reveal this missing piece in the story of the Milky Way's formation. Cambridge scientists have found evidence that the Milky Way was formed from the inside out. Using data from the Gaia-ESO project, scientists were able to back up predicted divisions in the chemical make-up of stars. Their research reveals how stars in centre of the Milky Way ‘live fast and die young’, shedding light on the formation of disk galaxies. The scientists analysed the levels of magnesium - which is present in older stars - to determine their age. Using the eight metre Very Large Telescope in Chile, they discovered the inner regions of the Milky Way were the first to form, explaining its 'flying saucer' shape.","University of Hawaii astronomer has obtained the first image of a young galaxy similar to our own Milky Way in the process of formation .

And it is more common than shoving a dummy in their mouth or giving them a soft toy or even a bottle in these high tech times. A range of apps for youngsters, including games, puzzles and educational programmes, means smartphones are now a parent’s best friend, said Asda. The study found 27 per cent of mothers give their phones to their children to keep them entertained.

"By . Julian Robinson . David Cameron called on Christians to be ‘more evangelical’ about their faith last night as he admitted he has felt the ‘healing power’ of the Church. In an Easter article for the Church Times, the Prime Minister said Christians should be ‘more confident’ in talking up their beliefs. Blending his faith and his pet political project the Big Society, Mr Cameron asked Christians to volunteer and ‘get out there and make a difference to people’s lives’. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured speaking at the Conservative Party Spring Forum in central London earlier this month, has said Britain should be 'more confident about our status as a Christian nation' The Prime Minister insisted that . being a Christian country did not mean 'doing down' other religions or . 'passing judgment' on those with no faith at all. It . comes after the Government came under attack from senior clergy over . its welfare reforms, but Mr Cameron has responded by saying 'we all . believe in many of the same principles' and that churches were 'vital . partners'. Mr Cameron described himself as a 'classic' member of the Church of England, 'not that regular in attendance, and a bit vague on some of the more difficult parts of the faith'. And he rejected the idea that in an 'ever more secular age' people should not talk about their religion. In his most robust words to date on the importance of religion in politics he said he wants to ‘infuse politics’ with Christian ‘ideals and values’ such as ‘hard work, charity, compassion, humility and love’. 'I believe we should be more confident about our status as a Christian country, more ambitious about expanding the role of faith-based organisations, and, frankly, more evangelical about a faith that compels us to get out there and make a difference to people's lives,' he said. 'First, being more confident about our status as a Christian country does not somehow involve doing down other faiths or passing judgment on those with no faith at all.' David Cameron has said Britain being 'more confident' about its status as a Christian country should not involve 'doing down' other faiths. He is pictured in Polzeath, North Cornwall, during a summer holiday with wife Samantha in August 2013 . Mr Cameron said he had 'felt at first . hand the healing power of the Church's pastoral care' and Christians . 'know how powerful faith can be in the toughest of times' – comments . that perhaps refer to the period when his eldest son Ivan died. Earlier this year the Government came . under attack from 27 Anglican bishops who warned that thousands of . people were being forced to rely on hand-outs from food banks as a . result of the coalition's benefit changes. The leader of the Roman Catholic . Church in England and Wales Cardinal Vincent Nichols has also said it . was a 'disgrace' that in such a wealthy country there were people who . could not afford to feed themselves. 'Many people tell me it is easier to be Jewish or Muslim in Britain than in a secular country precisely because the tolerance that Christianity demands of our society provides greater space for other religious faiths, too. 'Crucially, the Christian values of responsibility, hard work, charity, compassion, humility, and love are shared by people of every faith and none - and we should be confident in standing up to defend them. St Mary Abbotts School church, pictured to the left, in West London where David Cameron goes for Eucharist . 'People who, instead, advocate some . sort of secular neutrality fail to grasp the consequences of that . neutrality, or the role that faith can play in helping people to have a . moral code. Of course, faith is neither necessary nor sufficient for . morality. 'Many atheists . and agnostics live by a moral code - and there are Christians who don't. But for people who do have a faith, that faith can be a guide or a . helpful prod in the right direction - and, whether inspired by faith or . not, that direction or moral code matters.' Mr Cameron acknowledged that welfare was 'controversial' but said 'not enough is made of our efforts to tackle poverty' The Prime Minister, who has faced . criticism from within his own party over the Government's commitment to . spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income on overseas aid, said the . policy should be a 'source of national pride'. The article is the latest demonstration of Mr Cameron's religious faith. At an Easter reception in Downing . Street earlier this month he told an audience of Christian leaders and . politicians in Downing Street that his 'moments of greatest peace' occurred every other Thursday morning attending the Eucharist at St Mary Abbots, the west London church linked to the school his children attend. 'I find a little bit of peace and hopefully a bit of guidance,' he added.","PM admits he has felt the 'healing power' of the Church .

"By . Associated Press . Former Boston crime boss James 'Whitey' Bulger is appealing the federal conviction that sent him to prison for life last year, arguing that he was unable to fully present his defense. Bulger, who's 84, was convicted and sentenced on racketeering charges that tied him to 11 murders and other gangland crimes from the 1970s and '80s. In an appeal filed Thursday in the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Bulger's lawyers Henry Brennan and James Budreau argue he was 'deprived' of a critical defense in his trial: that a now-dead federal prosecutor had given him immunity from his crimes. Scroll down for video . Appeal: Attorneys for the former Boston crime boss say they expect to file an appeal Thursday of the convictions that sent crime boss Whitey Bulger to prison for life . Bulger had been an FBI informant against the rival New England Mafia, which his lawyers say allowed him to avoid prosecution for almost 25 years while his Winter Hill Gang consolidated power and built a criminal enterprise that took in millions of dollars through drugs, gambling, loansharking and other illegal activities. Bulger's case ultimately became a black eye for the FBI and the basis for recent Hollywood movies after it was revealed that corrupt federal agents had accepted bribes and protected him over the years. But, during the trial last year, Judge Denise Casper ruled Bulger couldn't raise the immunity claim because he offered no hard evidence to support it. The judge also said prosecutor Jeremiah O'Sullivan, who died in 2009, didn't have authority to grant such immunity. This 'constitutional error' affected the fairness of Bulger's trial and must result in reversal, his lawyers wrote in their appeal. Immortalized: Bulger (left) and the corrupt FBI agents who protected him are the subject of an upcoming film, Black Mass, starring Johnny Depp (right) 'If Mr. Bulger had been permitted to testify about his immunity defense in his own words, then the jury would have the opportunity to weigh his credibility with that of the government's witnesses,' they wrote. '... His testimony alone could have made a difference in the verdict.' Bulger's lawyers also argue they had been prevented from showing how the government's plea deals with three key witnesses — a gangster, a hit man and a Bulger protege — 'deeply inspired' the former associates to blame their boss for 'any and all crimes, regardless of the truth.' Bulger's lawyers hone in on hit man John Martorano, who admitted killing 20 people but served only 12 years in prison in exchange for testifying against Bulger. Bulger's lawyers say they should have been allowed to explore allegations Martorano had been committing new crimes since his release from prison. Prosecutors have said the allegations had been investigated and found untrue. Bulger fled Boston shortly before his 1995 indictment after being tipped off by a former FBI agent. He was one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives for 16 years until his 2011 arrest in Santa Monica, California. Following a 35-day trial, a federal jury last August found Bulger guilty of 31 of 32 counts, including racketeering, money laundering, extortion and firearms violations. The jury also found prosecutors had proved Bulger participated in 11 of the 19 murders of which he was accused. Bulger was sentenced in November 2013.","James 'Whitey' Bulger, 84, is appealing his conviction and life sentence on racketeering charges .

"By . Pete D'amato For Mailonline . Starbucks is trying to play catch up to your favorite local cafe by offering 'cold brew' coffee, a hipper and less acidic alternative to normal iced coffee, to customers in Boston-area stores. The Seattle-based giant became famous for introducing specialty coffee to a wider American audience as it expanded across the country, but on the coffee front the brewing behemoth has been outdone recently by smaller roasters and cafes. According to the blog Starbucks Melody, the chain began 'quietly' serving a 'core Ethiopian' iced coffee prepared on the Toddy cold brew system in one area around Boston. Be cool: Starbucks introduced cold brew coffee, a hip alternative to its normal iced coffee, to its stores with little fanfare . According to the system's instructions, preparing cold brew on the Toddy takes anywhere from 12 to 18 hours and produces a cup that's significantly less acidic than regular brewed coffee. This method is different than the normal preparation technique for iced coffee, which is brewed hot before being chilled and served over ice. GrubStreet states that cold brew is just one more way that Starbucks is 'inching into third-wave coffee,' the umbrella term for increased attention on brewing techniques and specialty coffee. Starbucks introduced pour over techniques and Clover machines, both of which produce one cup of coffee at a time, in recent years. Starbucks was beaten to the punch by a number of smaller-name coffee shops. The blog Shot Zombies says that Portland-based Stumptown Coffee Roasters was selling cold brew in stores and released a bottled version as far back as 2010. Cool kids: Profits for the Seattle-based giant are up, but coffee-wise it's being outdone by pretenders from Portland, Chicago and New York . There shouldn't be any reason for Starbucks to panic over being behind: Forbes says sales at the Seattle chain are up. Starbucks is preparing the cold brew in small daily batches, meaning that for locals need to hustle in for their fix before it sells out.","The company has not released plans for a wider release of cold brew coffee, which is being sold in Boston-area Starbucks .
Cold brew is prepared with grounds steeped in cold water for over 12 hours, as opposed to normal iced coffee, which is brewed hot then chilled .

"By . Emily Sheridan . Justin Lee Collins' ex-girlfriend Anna Larke has spoken of the comedian's controlling ways during their turbulent relationship, claiming he made her cut contact with friends and family. Former PR Anna, 38, said the Bristol-born funnyman, also 38, told her what clothes to wear and how to style her hair. When they were out in public, he ordered her to look at ground in case she caught another man's eye in the street. Turmoil: Justin Lee Collins (right) was found guilty of harassing his ex-girlfriend Anna Larke at St Albans Crown Court this week . Anna spoke out in today's Daily Mirror after Justin was found guilty this week of a single charge of harassment causing her fear of violence on at least two occasions. Judge John Plumstead described the crime as a . 'very serious matter' as he sentenced Collins to 140 hours community . service and ordered him to pay £3,500 costs. The former PR worker told how Collins started to take over her life within weeks of the couple moving into a flat in Kew, West London, in January, 2011. Anna told the Daily Mirror: 'He stopped me talking to my old friends and family, he bought my clothes, told me what to wear, how to have my hair.' She revealed that Collins was also incredibly jealous - telling her to 'look at the ground, the tree, any inanimate object' other than another man. She admitted she felt 'humiliated' when he made her list every man she had been intimate with on a notepad, with details of contraception used, what body parts were touched and sexual positions. Turbulent: Anna, pictured in Miami last year, claimed Justin made her look at the ground when they were out in public . Justin had left his wife Karen, 39, and their two children a few weeks earlier to move in with Anna, demanding the list of her conquests early into their relationship. He also made her get a new mobile number and told her not to contact her friends, and even her brother. She said: 'He made me close down my Facebook site, my Twitter. I wasn’t even allowed my own email, we had to have a joint one. 'Then he banned me from ringing my mum, who lives in Hertfordshire, unless he was in the room. Mum’s Greek and often we’d talk to each other in Greek on the phone but that had to stop too.' 'Mental abuse': Anna Larke saidCollins told her she was 'riddled with cellulite' During the trial, Anna had told St Albans Crown Court how Justin had  had spat in her face, yanked her hair back, hit her between her legs and slapped her in the face causing 'hundreds' of bruises. She said he forced her to close down . her email and Facebook accounts, sleep facing him, compile an explicit . dossier of her former lovers and throw away DVDs starring actors she . found attractive. Secret recordings were played in . which Collins swore at Miss Larke calling her a '****ing slag', 'dirty . vile whore' and '****ing coke head'. The jury heard that at one point Collins told her: 'When you're with me . you look at the ****ing ground, you look at a tree ... you don't look at . any other ****ing human being.' A jury of nine women and two men decided Collins was guilty of . a single charge of harassment causing Miss Larke fear of violence on at . least two occasions. The majority verdict came after almost 12 hours of . deliberation and after one juror was dismissed. But Mrs Collins – who is divorcing the presenter – gave evidence saying he was 'gentle, kind and generous'. Speaking from her home in Bristol, Mrs Collins described the . guilty verdict as 'ridiculous'. She said: 'At the moment my priority is . the children. But I can say that I think the verdict is ridiculous. I . don't believe it even for one second.' Domestic violence charities reacted with fury after he escaped with a community sentence for harassment. Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said: 'Until the courts give . sentences that fit the crime, men like Justin Lee Collins will get away . with campaigns of terror and thousands of women, like Anna, will . continue to be at risk.' Collins could have been jailed for up to five years for his campaign of physical and mental abuse against Anna. Looking cheerful: Collins in January 2011 with Miss Larke, shortly after he left wife Karen . The judge said: 'This is humbling work for someone who lives a prominent . public life, but the very humility that manual work will induce will . make you pause and think about what you have done.' But Miss Larke's brother Alex, who gave evidence against Collins, suggested the sentence was lenient because he was a celebrity. He said: 'The maximum for what he did to my sister was prison, but we live in a time when celebrities unfortunately don't get what comes to them.' Her family yesterday released a statement describing their relief at the verdict. It said: 'We are absolutely ecstatic at the verdict and are relieved the jury were able to see through the lies of an abuser. We will not rest on our laurels in the wake of this good news and intend to go out into the world and use this experience to empower women to stand up to domestic abuse.' In a statement, Collins's spokesman said: 'Justin is extremely disappointed by the verdict.'

"By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . Couples from the US and Australia, who were flying out with surrogate babies, have been barred from travel by immigration officials in Thailand as its local government continues its crackdown on surrogacy laws. It is believed the couples, including Australian homosexuals, were leaving from Bangkok international airport when they were stopped on Thursday afternoon, according to the ABC. One of the couples was with a surrogate mother. Scroll down for video . The alleged abandonment of baby Gammy - a child carried by surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua (pictured with the seven-month-old - sparked a surrogacy crackdown in Thailand . This discovery came after two American couples were also stopped for the same thing in the past 24 hours. Another Australian couple were also sent home from Bangkok on Sunday when they tried to leave the country with a baby born via a surrogate mother, Fairfax Media reported. Unless a court order directs otherwise, immigration officials have the authority to stop surrogate babies leaving the country. Meanwhile, Thailand's new government looks to push through legislation looking at halting commercial surrogacy. Two Australian couples were stopped at Bangkok international airport on Thursday while trying to travel out of the country with surrogate babies . Wendy and David Farnell, from Western Australia, were accused of abandoning Gammy and taking only his twin sister, Pipah, when they found out he had Down syndrome . Members of the Thai parliament are from the militia and its army general is trying to prevent Thailand from becoming a surrogacy hotbed for overseas couples by criminalising it. The country's sudden crackdown on the industry was sparked by an Australian couple who caused international outcry when they were accused of leaving behind a Thai-born baby named Gammy when they found out he had Down syndrome, instead taking his twin sister home with them. Gammy's surrogate mother, Pattaramon Chanbua, was the one who levelled the accusations at Western Australian couple David and Wendy Farnell. In another twist in the story, it emerged David Farnell had been convicted of 22 child sex offences - including a victim aged just seven - in his 20s. The couple appeared on 60 Minutes on Sunday to hit back at the claims made by Ms Pattaramon, 21 . Farnell was sentenced to three years jail in 1997 for sexually molesting two girls in 'secretive meetings' in his shed or house, in 1982 and 1983, when the girls were aged seven and 10. The couple hid their home for a week while media was camped outside and Western Australian government officials from the Department of Child Protection sought them out for a meeting after the news of Farnell's past surfaced. David and Wendy Farnell appeared on Channel Nine's 60 Minutes on Sunday to hit back at reports circulating they had abandoned Gammy. 'It's been very stressing. We miss our little boy. I come home from work some days and Wendy has dressed our little girl (Gammy's twin sister Pipah) all in blue because she wants to remember the little boy,' Farnell told the news program. 'We said we want both babies to be born and we will think about this.'","Four couples, from the U.S. and Australia, have been stopped in Bangkok .

"By . Sean Poulter for Daily Mail . The problem appears to have occurred because Procter & Gamble has changed the way it markets Fairy Liquid . The scientists at Fairy Liquid have spent more than 60 years tweaking the formula to ensure a little goes a long way – however, it seems, they struggle with basic maths. The popular brand has run into trouble after a recent TV commercial caught the eye of former maths teacher James Clifford. The voiceover proclaimed that the washing-up liquid lasts 50 per cent longer than rival products. However, this boast was illustrated with an image of Fairy Liquid next to two bottles of an unidentified rival – suggesting it lasts 100 per cent longer. It was clear to Mr Clifford, who gave up a teaching career in September to launch a training business, that both could not be true and so he made a complaint. Now the Advertising Standards Authority, which said that Mr Clifford was one of ten people to have spotted the problem, has instructed manufacturer Procter & Gamble to change the commercial. Mr Clifford, 39, said: ‘You do not need to be a maths genius to understand this was wrong.’ The problem appears to have occurred because Procter & Gamble has changed the way it markets Fairy Liquid. For generations, it claimed Fairy lasted 50 per cent longer, but two years ago began claiming it lasted twice as long, a boast other manufacturers objected to. Now it has gone back to claiming it lasts 50 per cent longer. For hands that do dishes - Fairy Liquid changed its bottle shape . Procter & Gamble said that while the advert compared Fairy’s lasting power to two bottles of a rival product, one of these was only half full. The company said the only error was that the images were not shown for long enough to make it clear that one bottle of Fairy is equivalent to one and a half bottles of a rival.","Former teacher James Cliifford was one of ten viewers who spotted the error .

"By . Alex Finnis For Mail Online . If you flicked through his photographs, you might think that surfing instructor Callum Morse lives in Tenerife or Hawaii. You would never believe that his stunning pictures of sunrises and sunsets, captured from inside rolling waves, were taken literally just off these shores - on the coast of Cornwall. Mr Morse, 22, has been capturing incredible images of daybreak and twilight from the sea for five years, and they give us views normally reserved for the very bravest of surfers - from inside the barrels of waves. Callum Morse, 22, lives in St Ives, Cornwall, but people struggle to believe him when he tells them his photos were taken there and not in Hawaii or the Canary Islands. This photo was taken at sunset in St Ives Bay (Hayle) This image, taken at Porthtowan, gives  a rare glimpse into the lives of the bravest of surfers, seeing sunrises and sunsets as never before - through the barrel of a wave . The sunrises create some incredible, vivid colours as they catch the tips of the crashing waves, like these at St Ives Bay (Hayle) The St Ives man is extremely dedicated to his cause -  he will wade out into freezing waters in the early hours while it is still dark to make sure he catches the sunrise. He is constantly battered against rocks and has been seriously injured before, but it is all worth it when he sees the faces of people who cannot believe his photos were taken just minutes from their homes. 'I'm addicted to trying to get the perfect shot and that's what keeps me out in the waves,' he said. Mr Morse has seriously injured himself while taking the photos before - his camera crashed into his head and split it open, but it has not deterred him from continuing, This photo was taken at Godrevy . The surf instructor goes all over Cornwall to take the photographs, which he then compiles into calendars and sells. This one is from Porthmeor (St Ives) 'It is grey most of the time in Cornwall but it can look quite tropical especially when the sun is coming up. 'A lot of people are surprised to find out that my pictures were taken in the UK - people think these pictures must have been taken in Hawaii or the Canary Islands. 'Even the local surfers who know the coast here better than anyone think they could not have been taken in Cornwall.' Mr Morse heads down to the beaches like Godrevy  in the early hours and gets into the sea while it is still dark so that he is prepared to capture that perfect sunrise photo . He will spend hours in the water at places like this in Porthleven - as long as five at a time, and says that he can only ever be found in the sea or in the pub . Mr Morse has a girlfriend of two years, 21-year-old Holly Lanyon, also from St Ives, and luckily, she doesn't mind that her boyfriend spends so much time in the sea. 'She is pretty cool about me being in the water all the time,' he said. 'She doesn't come out with me when I take my pictures, I prefer being by myself to take them. 'Since we have been together I have taught her how to surf, so we both do spend some time together in the sea.' Mr Morse takes pictures all over Cornwall and sells calendars featuring his pictures. Some of his snaps hang in local restaurants and hotels. Mr Morse has been taking the unique photographs for five years, starting out when he was just a teenager. This one comes from Porthleven . Mr Morse is often smashed into rocks and back onto the sand by large powerful waves, but says the knocks and scrapes are worth the end result. This huge wave was captured at Watergate Bay in Newquay . He often spends as long as five hours in the water with his Canon EOS 7D SLR, waiting to capture the perfect picture from inside a wave. 'I'm rarely out of the sea. I'm either in the water or in the pub,' he said. 'I try and wait for the magic hour - the hour around sunrise and the hour around sunset. 'This means I'll get in the water when its dark and get straight in the sea to wait for the sun to come up. 'I can be in the water for hours - basically until I fill up my memory card.' The impressive photographer often does not leave the water until he has filled up his entire memory card with images like this, from Watergate Bay . Cornwall is one of the best areas of the UK for surfing, along with neighbouring county Devon, as well as parts of Wales and Scotland. This was was snapped at Godrevy . The bold wave-rider said he has severely hurt himself before, while trying to photograph the crashing waves, but says that comes as part and parcel of what he does. 'To take the pictures you need to stand right in the impact zone, the area where the wave curls over,' he said. 'If you want to get the shot you have to put yourself in a position where you will get crumpled up on the beach or smashed up into the sand. 'I split my head open with the waterproof housing on my camera once. The wave hit the camera and the camera hit me in the face and I caught the sharp edge of the housing. 'Sometimes I shoot on a shallow reef, so when the wave hits I get smashed into the rocks. 'It doesn't deter me at all because I love getting the pictures, and who cares about a few scratches and bumps?' A green-blue wave rolls towards the camera at sunset at Godrevy, the colour of the water contrasting with the reds and oranges in the sky .","Callum Morse, 22, spends as long as five hours in the water at a time with his Canon EOS 7D SLR .

"By . Chris Wheeler for Daily Mail . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . Manchester City's new signing Bacary Sagna has apologised to team-mate Pablo Zabaleta for ‘losing the plot’ during an angry bust-up between the two players. Sagna was still coming to terms with the sudden death of his elder brother Omar from a seizure when he reacted furiously to a comment made by Zabaleta in a goalless draw between Arsenal and City at the Emirates in January 2011. He twice thrust his head into the Argentine’s face and both players were sent off, although Zabaleta’s red card was later rescinded. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Bacary Sagna training in the gym ahead of the new season . Confrontation: Pablo Zabaleta (right) pushes Bacary Sagna (left) during a match in January 2011 . Head-to-head: Sagna will be hoping to dislodge fellow right-back Zabaleta at new side Manchester City . Sagna, who will compete with Zabaleta to play at right-back for City after arriving on a free transfer from Arsenal this summer, now admits he over-reacted. ‘I’ll say I was wrong,’ confessed the Frenchman. ‘It’s in the past. I made a mistake and I apologise. ‘I understand Spanish and he said something. He didn’t mean to say it to me but I took it personally – I lost the plot. ‘It was a very emotional day for me. I had just lost my brother and was not in a good frame of mind. ‘It’s one of the only times I have lost my cool, but I had just lost someone in my family. I didn’t talk to anyone and kept everything inside, so when it happened I just went crazy. I was too upset to talk to him after the game.’ Seeing red: Both Sagna and Zabaleta were sent off after their confrontation in a goalless draw . Sagna saw a psychologist to address the issue and hopes to offer Zabaleta an explanation face to face. ‘Now I’m in a good place,’ he added. ‘It’s part of life and I’m okay. I did seek help when I was at Arsenal two or there times. It was good for me to talk about it. ‘I know he (Zabaleta) is a nice guy and was the first one to come over to me at training. We have not talked about it since I came here but if I get the chance one day I will explain to him.’ Even so, Sagna has no intention of playing second fiddle to fans' favourite Zabaleta after signing a three-year deal at City. ‘I know the fans love him, but this is the right challenge for me because I felt a bit in a comfort zone at Arsenal,’ he said. ‘I know I will have to fight and train really hard to get into the team. ‘The manager is going to choose the one who is in form, not the one who has just come here or who has been with the team a long time.’ Summer signings: Sagna joined Manchester City along with his fellow countryman Eliaquim Mangala .","Manchester City signed Bacary Sagna on a free transfer this summer .

It appears that many of our favourite jokes – including even the famous Python dead parrot sketch – can be traced back to the Romans. According to historian Mary Beard, the sketch, in which John Cleese complains to a shopkeeper that the parrot he bought is an ‘ex-parrot’, originally made senators and emperors chuckle. Historian Mary Beard claims some of the UK's favourite gags, including the famous 'dead parrot' sketch from Monty Python, all came from a Roman joke book . The original version features a man who complains that his slave has died shortly after purchase. The slave trader replies simply: ‘When he was with me, he never did any such thing.’ According to Professor Beard, who presents BBC history programmes, the joke is just one of the ‘Monty Python-esque’ gags that made the Romans laugh. Enoch Powell once quipped that a talkative barber asked him how he'd like his hair  cut, to which he replied 'quietly' - another joke from the book . ‘We have learned how to joke from the Romans,’ she said at a talk to promote her new book Laughter in Ancient Rome: On Joking, Tickling and Cracking Up. The professor added that we should thank them for the ‘building blocks with which our own modern [comic] repertoire is constructed’. Much of what we know about classical humour comes from a Roman joke book containing 265 gags known as the Philogelos – translated as Laughter Lover. It is thought to be a collection of different manuscripts rather than the work of a single author. Another favourite joke – credited to former Conservative minister Enoch Powell – is the one about a chatty barber who asks his customer how he would like his hair cut. The customer replies tersely: ‘In silence.’ Professor Beard said: ‘What almost everybody failed to realise – but I’m sure Powell knew because he was one of the world’s best classicists – that joke is actually from the Roman joke book, absolutely the same.’ Other Roman jokes include one about a miser who made himself the heir in his own will and the patient who complains to a doctor about feeling dizzy half an hour after waking up. The doctor replies: ‘Get up half an hour later.’","Roman joke book Philogelos revealed as source of nation's best gags .

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Alan Pardew has blamed Yohan Cabaye for the 4-0 drubbing at Manchester City on the opening day of last season – and has warned the champions his side are much stronger one year on. The France midfielder refused to play at the Etihad as he tried to force through a move to Arsenal. Pardew, though, only learned of Cabaye's strike on the day of the game and his team subsequently put in a shambolic performance in which Steven Taylor was sent off for elbowing Sergio Aguero. Blame game: Alan Pardew said last season's opening day defeat to Manchester City was Yohan Cabaye's fault . Cabaye, of course, remained at the club until January before moving to Paris Saint-Germain for £20million. Newcastle are preparing to welcome City to St James' on Sunday, and Pardew said: 'At the time (last season) we were in dispute with our midfield player. When we got off that bus, was he going to play or was he not going to play? 'The difference now is we're much more settled.The disruption of that unsettled us. Training day: Newcastle players step up their preparations before playing Manchester City on Sunday . Krul to be kind: Dutch keeper Tim Krul will hope to keep Sergio Aguero and the City forwards at bay on Sunday . 'We lost a player (Steven Taylor to a red card) in the first half, which is maybe a consequence of the frustration we were all sharing.' Pardew has added nine players to his squad this summer and believes Manuel Pellegrini will see a big improvement in the Magpies. 'We have a new-found sense belief and players grow when they see new signings,' he added. Making his point: Alan Pardew has been busy in the transfer market  over the summer months . 'If you see more quality around you feel more confident. 'The players who have been here a while see that the group is bigger and stronger. 'I do feel we can give them a good game.'

Pardew will be without Siem de Jong (calf) and Chieck Tiote (hamstring) this weekend, but feels he now has the resource to deal with their loss. 'In terms of players we have now got a really strong group which makes my job easier,' he said. 'There is some real quality offensively, which we didn't have at the back end of last season. Enforcer: Cheik Tiote will be important for Newcastle this season but will miss Sunday's match . 'I'm looking forward to putting them on the pitch and bringing back a brand of football, that the fans like to see. 'There are a few players out and normally that would be too big a blow against a team like Man City, but we're able to cope and that shows the strength in depth we've got.

A disgusted mother got more than she bargained for when she opened up her tin of Tesco Value potatoes - only to find a live maggot crawling inside. Teaching assistant Amanda Cooper was preparing dinner for her children Aidan, 12, and Abby, 10, when she saw the bug wriggling across what was supposed to be their meal. Ms Cooper, 33, bought the 15p tin, which had a sell-by date of March 2017, from a Tesco Express store near her home in Cambridge. 'It was horrible,' she said. 'When you buy a tin of something which has been processed in what you think is a clean environment, you expect to get just what you want. 'It put me right off. It was a Saturday afternoon sausage and broccoli dinner, just something easy for a Saturday. 'I buy the tin occasionally to back up my cupboards, just to have as a staple. 'In the end they just had the sausage and broccoli. I kept schtum about it until after we had eaten, but when Aidan saw the tin he was absolutely horrified.' Ms Cooper returned the tin to the store, was given her money back and told told that someone would be in touch. 'I was happy with the way they dealt with it in-store, but I am really put off buying any tinned stuff now, and I won't be shopping in Tesco any time soon. 'When you buy lettuce or fresh food you wash your salad as you might get little things there where it's straight out of a field into the shop, but when you have got something processed that has been tinned it opens all sorts of questions.' Put off: Ms Cooper says she is now wary of buying tinned food and will not be shopping at Tesco again soon . A Tesco spokeswoman said: 'We set ourselves high standards for the quality of the food we sell and were disappointed to hear of this incident.

"By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . The test opener of the Bledisloe Cup left Wallabies star Israel Folau red-faced and bleeding, but it was not from chasing down the opposition. The full-back came off second best after an embarrassing clash with teammate Nic White, and walked away clutching his nose as blood gushed down his face at ANZ Stadium in Sydney on Saturday. But after a quick spritz from his water bottle and a dab of a tissue, Folau was back on the field and minutes later he had another run-in - this time with a referee, which left both of them on their backs. It was a slow start for the Wallabies who failed to gain traction and finished the first-half six points down against the All Blacks who had garnered nine points. But when the final siren went, the home side again denied the Kiwis a record 18th consecutive test win, ending the game on a draw with 12 points a piece. Two years ago, an 18-18 draw in Brisbane prevented the All Blacks matching the 18 straight wins by New Zealand from 1965-69 and South Africa's 1997-98 outfit - and the first tryless Test in Sydney since 1979 denied the Kiwis again on Saturday night. Wallabies five-eighth Kurtley Beale and All Blacks opposite Aaron Cruden both landed four penalty goals in a wet and sloppy - but ultimately gripping - match at ANZ Stadium. South African Jaco Peyper's pedantic and, at times, bemusing refereeing reduced the much-anticipated trans-Tasman showdown to a dour, stop-start affair in front of a 68,627 fans. The two rivals are set to meet again on August 23 at Auckland's Eden Park. Scroll down for video .

"By . Pete Jenson . Follow @@petejenson . Barcelona's new coach Luis Enrique finished Wednesday’s friendly against Napoli with 10 youth-team players on the pitch and seems determined to give youth its chance. But who from Barca’s academy will really make the step up to the first team? VIDEO Scroll down for 'Halilovic's first senior goal for Dinamo Zagreb vs. Slaven Belupo' Martin Montoya (23) He was the oldest outfield player on the pitch last night and finished the game with the captain’s armband. He knows this is a make or break season at Barcelona with Dani Alves looking out of a favour and Barca unlikely to bring in a new specialist right-back. Big opportunity: Martin Montoya (left) has a chance to become Barcelona's new first-choice right-back . Alejandro Grimaldi (18) Very highly thought of at Barcelona and the eventual successor to Jordi Alba. He offers the same attacking threat from deep although it might still be a while before he’s ahead of the Spain international. Edgar Le (20) Ticks at least two of the Barcelona defender boxes because he can also play at right-back and the comes out from the back with great confidence. Also defends well but there is no imminent step-up on the horizon. Seung woo Lee (16) After bettering Leo Messi’s youth team scoring statistics Lee put most of the top teams in Europe on alert with his finshing, his speed and his intelligence. Unfortunately for Barcelona, Fifa were also alerted to the way he was brought from Korea to Calalonia, and the game’s governing body say their rules on the relocation of young players parents were broken so he can only play in friendlies until he turns 18. He looks set to stay at Barcelona however and those who have watched his development since arriving in 2011 believe if he continues to progress it will be well worth the wait. Frank Bagnack (19) A graduate of Barcelona’s Cameroon academy set up by Samuel Eto’o, Bagnack is lightning quick but like Le not expected to step up to the first team despite Barcelona’s shortcomings in the centre of defence. Sergi Samper (19) Perhaps the pick of the bunch. Keeps possession well but not at the expense of moving the ball forward purposefully. Should make the step up at some point soon. Big things expected of a midfielder who Barcelona have tied to the club until 2017 and have no intention of letting go despite interest from the Premier League. More to come: Defensive midfielder Sergi Samper (right) is one of Barca's brightest prospects . Sergi Roberto (22) Stepped up to the first team squad last season but without really taking his chance and may not be far from the crossroads of a move away from Barcelona on loan to show he can take the next step. Another tidy midfielder but needs to show he can also drive a team forward. Pep Guardiola was a big fan and looked at taking him to Bayern last year. Wanted: Midfielder Sergi Roberto (right) was considered by Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola last summer . Munir El Haddadi (18) Plays wide left or through the middle and was the only youngster to start for Barca against Napoli – ahead of Gerard Deulofeu who Luis Enrique says still needs to improve defensively. He showed plenty of intelligent running and was played in twice for goalscoring chances but failed to take his chance both times. Impossible to step up with so much talent ahead of him. Battle: Munir El Haddadi (left) played well against Napoli but he is unlikely to break into Enrique's first XI . Alen Halilovic (18) Much is expected of the Croatia national team’s youngest ever debutant who will play for Barca’s B-team this season but with an eye to a fast-track to the first team. Can play wide in the front three but far more comfortable in midfield where his left-foot passing range can cut teams open. Bright future: Croatian Alen Halilovic (right) is expected to become a star at the Nou Camp . Adama Traore (18) The jury is split on Adama. Is he the next big thing to come out of football club Barcelona or does he just look so good at B-team level because he is so much quicker and stronger than his peers? If his footballing brain develops to match his pace, power and skill he will soon make the step-up. A season on loan similar to Deulofeu's at Everton might help that process. On the move: Winger Adama Traore could benefit from first-team football on loan at another club . VIDEO Xavi announces his retirement . CLICK HERE to start picking your Fantasy Football team NOW!

"By . James Salmon for Daily Mail . Follow @@JamesSalmon79 . Millions of customers are being targeted by sales-hungry Lloyds staff despite the bank’s appalling record on mis-selling. Branches are under increased pressure to sell more insurance policies, loans and investments, secret documents reveal. Despite racking up a £10billion bill for mis-selling payment protection insurance (PPI), Britain’s biggest bank has ordered staff to meet increased sales targets or face losing their bonuses – or even their job. Cut throat: Staff at Lloyds, Britain's biggest bank, face losing bonuses or their job if they don't meet targets . And the edict was issued months after Lloyds – which was bailed out by the taxpayer in 2008 – was fined £28million by watchdogs over its ruthless sales culture and ‘champagne’ bonuses. The order to ramp up sales led one exasperated employee to post a message on the company’s intranet asking: ‘Will this bank never learn?’ The secret move was revealed by a whistleblower who has lifted the lid on the bank’s rapacious methods. The whistleblower, a senior personal banking adviser at a North London branch of Lloyds, says staff fear for their jobs and are mis-selling insurance and investments just to hit their sales targets. To back up his claims, he has handed internal documents to the Daily Mail showing the latest targets. Lloyds has insisted it has eradicated the sales culture which has blighted so many of its 30million customers. But managers raised their targets in March, the documents show. They reveal the elaborate points system Lloyds now uses to encourage staff to sell products to customers who walk into a High Street branch. The system is skewed to encourage the sale of products which are more profitable for the bank but often riskier or more expensive for the customer. Selling a £10,000 loan generates 550 points while selling a junior cash Isa generates just 23. Staff who fail to hit their targets miss out on their bonus – an important incentive to personal banking advisers whose average starting salary is just £19,055. The whistleblower, who asked not to be identified, said: ‘The bank pretends they don’t talk about sales but they do. Staff are being exploited by the bank and we are all under huge pressure. ‘It is difficult to give honest advice to customers. There is a clear incentive to lend as much to customers as possible. Most of us are not trying to get a bonus. Dishonest? A whistleblower said it is difficult to give honest advice to customers while keeping a bonus or job . 'Sometimes people are mis-selling to customers because they don’t want to be disciplined. Lots of advisers are on “red”, which means they haven’t hit their targets. People are afraid of losing their jobs.’ The employee came forward after the Mail published a leaked internal email last week which revealed the bank is continuing to pressure staff to mis-sell credit cards, loans and insurance. In the memo, a regional manager chastised staff for failing to hit targets. Referring to the number of daily appointments advisers are expected to make, it warns: ‘I’ll give you a clue that 1s, 2s and 3s are simply not acceptable.’ The email, described by Lloyds Trade Union as ‘gratuitous, threatening and menacing’, emerged in the same week that the bank’s bill for mis-selling PPI topped £10billion – dwarfing the provisions made by its rivals. Lloyds insisted the email ‘is in no way representative of behaviour across the group’, adding it had launched an internal investigation and was taking disciplinary action. But the internal documents passed to the Mail reveal how Lloyds increased its sales targets for staff by more than a quarter in March – three months after the bank was fined £28million for promoting a ruthless sales culture. Staff were handed bonuses for selling customers investments they did not want or need. One salesman sold insurance to himself, his wife and a colleague to prevent his salary from being cut. Comments posted on the company’s intranet – in response to a weekly blog posted by Lloyds retail boss Owen Woodley – reveal the bitterness felt by some staff who feel under increased pressure. Lloyds branch staff are awarded points for selling a product, such as an insurance policy or a fee-charging bank account. They also earn points if they refer a customer to a Lloyds financial adviser who goes on to make a sale. Each employee is given a quarterly sales target based on a multiple of 1.91 times their salary. So a worker earning an annual salary of £20,000 will have to generate 38,200 points every three months. If they hit their target, they qualify for a bonus. Lloyds says employees also have to satisfy a range of other criteria, such as providing good customer service, in order to win bonuses. But products that are more profitable for the bank – which tend to be either more risky or more expensive for the customer – will bring in more points towards their sales target. So a tax-free cash Isa will generate just 45 points. But referring a customer to a financial adviser who then sells them a life insurance policy will generate 500 points for the frontline staff member. If they refer a customer and it results in a mortgage sale they will get 1,200 points. A frontline staff member who simply books an appointment with an investment manager for a customer will also receive 500 points. A personal loan will generate 55 points per £1,000 borrowed – so the bigger the loan, the more points awarded. One employee said: ‘[Is this] really the way to motivate staff and prevent mis-selling? Surely when we are supposed to be needs-based selling, the pressure should stop.’ Another said: ‘And so it begins again, the pressure to sell to our customers, targets for internet banking, targets for Club Lloyds, will this bank never learn!!!!’ But last night a Conservative MP said Lloyds’ staff could not absolve themselves from blame. Mark Garnier a member of the Treasury Select Committee said: ‘Frontline staff need to be exposed to sanctions for responding to flawed sales incentives. 'A defence of “I was only obeying my bonus incentive scheme” is simply unacceptable. Sales staff have a crucial role to play in upping standards at banks and they must all be held responsible for bad practice, not just their managers.’ Lloyds said it has ditched straightforward sales targets, and said annual bonuses are based on ‘balanced scorecards’, which gauge feedback from customers. But it admitted that targets for staff were increased in March. It refused to reveal the size of the bonuses available to staff, but said they are based on a percentage of salary. A spokesman said: ‘Our key objective is to help our customers manage their money in the best possible way. ‘Our training, processes and measures are focused on providing excellent service to our valued customers. We conduct regular reviews to ensure that customer needs are being appropriately met, but encourage our colleagues to talk to us if they do have any concerns.’","Banks under increasing pressure to sell more policies, loans, investments .
