"By . Sam Webb . A builder who battered and stabbed his ex-girlfriend’s father and then poured petrol over him before setting him alight was today jailed for a minimum of 27 years for his murder. James Carbott, 31, beat Thomas Baird with a crowbar and stabbed him with a retractable blade knife inside his bungalow in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. He left, but returned to destroy evidence by dousing petrol on 63-year-old Mr Baird, who was lying on his doorstep and was either dead or dying. He set his body and the victim’s bungalow alight. James Carbott, 31, beat Thomas Baird with a crowbar and stabbed him with a retractable blade knife inside his bungalow. He later set the body alight. He was today jailed for a minimum of 27 years . Sentencing him to life at St Albans Crown Court, Judge Andrew Bright QC said: 'Your attack was brutal and relentless.' The jury heard Carbott had split up from Mr Baird’s daughter Kelly in October 2012, five months before the killing. When Carbott, who had worked as a builder for Mr Baird, moved in with Kelly he had diverted the electricity supply, so that it bypassed the meter. After he left, Mr Baird wanted him to correct the wiring. Carbott promised to meet Mr Baird on the Tuesday before he died, but rang to cancel. He was then supposed to call him on the Thursday, but did not. Prosecutor Stuart Trimmer said the defendant’s behaviour seriously annoyed Mr Baird, who spoke to friends and relatives and threatened violence to Carbott and said he would damage the home where he lived with his mother. Scene: The bungalow in Hemel Hempstead where Mr Baird was killed and set on fire . In response to voicemail messages left by Mr Baird, Carbott went to his terraced bungalow in Westerdale. There he attacked Mr Baird, who was only 5 feet 6 tall and weighed just 66 kilos, with the knife and crowbar before setting him alight. A post mortem examination revealed 17 cuts and stab wounds to the head, face and neck. There were also stab penetrations fracturing the jaw. His voice box was fractured, a wound that may have been caused by severe gripping, but is more likely to have been due to kicking or stamping while on the ground. Carbott was arrested the following day and told the police: 'What's this got to do with me? I haven't been anywhere' Pathologist Dr Nat Carey found internal bleeding in the brain and evidence of blunt impacts, including one very forceful blow to the right side, causing fracturing of the vault and base of the skull. There was burning to his head, trunk and legs. A lack of soot inhalation suggested Mr Baird was either dead or dying at the time he was set alight. Carbott was arrested at ten to five the following day and told the police: 'What’s this got to do with me? I haven’t been anywhere. 'All I have done is walk my dog. I have been at my mum’s.' He made no comment in four police interviews, but gave the officers a prepared statement through his solicitor in which he said Mr Baird had left threats to him and his mother on his voicemail. He said he did not want him threatening his mother and went to Mr Baird’s home. When he went to the door he said Mr Baird appeared with a crowbar and a knife and said: 'J - have this' and pushed the knife towards him. He said there was a struggle in which he disarmed him and caused injuries. In the statement Carbott admitted he had started the fire because he was scared. He said he had left the scene in his silver Mondeo estate and headed to a farm track on the Redbourn Road near Woodend Farm where he burned his clothes and the petrol and threw the knife and crow bar in a ditch. Carbott, of Epping Green, Hemel Hempstead, pleaded not guilty to murdering Mr Baird between Friday 1 March and Saturday 2 March last year and also denied arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered. But at the end of a trial last month the jury of eight men and four women convicted him of murder by a majority of 10 to 2. They unanimously convicted him of the arson charge. Giving evidence Carbott said Mr Baird was a 'good laugh'. Asked by his barrister Richard Carey-Hughes how they got on, he replied: 'Fine. We used to got out drinking, watch football and go to the pub. He was a good laugh. He was OK.' He said he suffered anxiety and depression after being attacked in 2007. He had also been diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. 'I had suicidal thoughts. I used to self-harm a lot. I was always planning in my head to kill myself,' he said. A post-mortem examination revealed 17 cuts and stab wounds to Mr Baird's head, face and neck. There were also stab penetrations fracturing the jaw . He said he had known Mr Baird for two years before he died and had been 'best friends' with his son Tommy Baird. But Tommy did not speak to him again after Carbott had hit him when he intervened during a row Tommy was having with his sister. After Mr Baird died and he was remanded in custody, Carbott said he had nightmares and flashbacks. 'I was waking up screaming. It was terrifying,' he said. Setting a minimum term of 27 years before Carbott can apply for parole, Judge Bright told Carbott, who appeared for sentence via a video link from Bedford jail: 'When you lose your temper, as you did that night, you are a very dangerous man.' Following the sentencing today the victim's family and the police have released statements. Thomas' daughter, Kelly, said: 'Myself and Harry would like to send thanks to all those who have been involved in Tom's case. 'I am extremely grateful for the fantastic support we have received over the last 11 months. 'Life without my Dad has felt unbearable and felt as though we are living in limbo. This void in our lives will never be filled. 'My dad was devoted to me and Harry and we have a daily struggle without him in our lives. He was the most secure and constant person in our lives. He became my rock and my best friend in my adult life and to say I feel lost and alone is an understatement. 'Harry adored his Grandad and aspired to be like him and he has been robbed of having him around to support and guide him to adulthood. 'We will never recover from this tragedy and our lives will never be the same again. We are now however reaching a point where we can begin to grieve and rebuild our lives, and we ask and thank people in advance for the privacy to do so.' Speaking about the sentence, Detective Inspector John Arthur from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, who led the investigation said: 'Thomas was the victim of a horrific and sustained attack and Carbott lied in an attempt to cover his tracks. 'Although this sentence will do nothing to bring back Thomas to his family, it does reflect the severity of Carbott's actions and I am pleased with today's sentence. 'I would like to pay tribute to Thomas's family as they have not only lost their loved one in the most brutal way, they have had to endure a trial and relive the horrific events which took place that night. 'Whilst the verdict and sentence will not bring Thomas back, I hope this sentence is of some comfort to them and that it will assist them with moving forward with their lives.'","James Carbott battered and stabbed Thomas Baird to death .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Headteacher Peter Maddocks, who failed to attend an emergency public meeting about high levels of absent staff at his school in Dolgellau, Wales . A school has come under fire today after it was forced to hold an emergency meeting about high levels of absent staff - but when parents turned up, the headteacher was not there. Governors at Ysgol y Gader school in Dolgellau, Gwynedd, Wales, agreed to the meeting after parents created a petition voicing concerns over staff absenteeism. It also said they were alarmed about teaching and learning standards. The meeting was due to be held last Wednesday at 7pm in the school hall. However, headteacher Peter Maddocks was not present - with parents apparantly unaware he was not going to attend. The council have confirmed that he was not at the meeting and is currently absent from work - but they did not explain why. However, one parent at the 400-pupil school, who asked not to be named, said they have been told he is off sick. They said: 'The meeting was a farce and now we have been told the headteacher is off sick. Someone needs to step in to sort this mess out. 'Ysgol y Gader used to be an excellent school, but parents don't know what's happening.' Another angry parent said: 'The damage has already been done.' It is not clear whether anyone else was present to represent the headteacher. The parent petition handed to governors read: . 'We believe that the school is failing to provide suitably-qualified . staff to cover lessons during long-term staff absences, which leads to a . lack of consistence and rigour in the standard of teaching and . learning. 'It also causes a lack of progress in pupils' learning. 'We are also concerned about the number of experienced staff who have recently left Ysgol y Gader, sometimes at short notice.' The . petition went on to say: 'Pupils regularly complain that they have not . had a formal lesson and/or that lessons are poorly planned with a lack . of continuity and progression. 'Pupils . also regularly complain of being taught by classroom assistants, who . are there to support the qualified teachers, not to shoulder the . responsibility of delivering the lesson, . Parents began the petition following concerns over high levels of staff absence and teaching standards at the Ysgol y Gader School (pictured) 'This is unfair on the classroom assistant and unfair on the pupils.' The . governors' letter informing parents of the meeting said: 'Following a . petition received from parents/guardians, a meeting between the school . governors and parents will be held on Wednesday, 19 March, 2014 at . 7.00pm in the school hall.' A Gwynedd Council spokesman said: 'We . can confirm that Ysgol y Gader's headteacher was not present at the . public meeting last week and that he is not at work at present. 'In the meantime, a member of staff has been designated as a headteacher-in-charge.' Cllr Dyfrig Siencyn, chairman of governors at Ysgol y Gader said: 'The governing body recognises that there are concerns regarding staff absenteeism at Ysgol y Gader during the current academic year. 'As a school we are working with Gwynedd Council's education department and taking all possible steps to address the situation so that we ensure continuity of the pupils' education.' Cllr Dyfrig Siencyn said after the three-hour meeting he was not in a position to make an additional statement. Dewi . Jones, Gwynedd Council head of education said: 'Gwynedd Council's . Education Department works with all the county's schools to raise . educational standards. 'In . the case of Ysgol y Gader, education officers are working closely with . the staff and governors to address the concerns that have been raised.' Dear Parent/Guardian . Following a petition received from parents/guardians, a meeting between the school governors and parents will be held on: . Wednesday, 19 March, 2014 at 7.00pm in the school hall. The agenda of the meeting will be to discuss the two following points only: . 1. Staff absenteeism and staff turnover. We believe the high levels of staff absenteeism in Ysgol Y Gader are having a detrimental impact on pupils' progress and achievement in their studies. We believe that the school is failing to provide consistance (sic) and rigour in the standard of teaching and learning. It also causes a lack of progress in pupils' learning. This is particular concern in the case of core subjects such as science and maths, but also in subjects such as music. ""We are also concerned about the number of experienced staff who have recently left Ysgol y Gader, sometimes at short notice. This was evident in the case of history where a member of staff left abruptly during the summer, which consequently meant a whole term of GCSE syllabus was delivered by a retired supply teacher. This adds weight to the strong anecdotal evidence to suggest there is a culture of overbearing management in the school, causing a serious issue with staff morale. 2. Monitoring of standards in teaching and learning. We are concerned about the standards in teaching and learning in some subjects. Pupils regularly complain that they have not had a formal lesson and/or that lessons are poorly planned, with a lack of continuity and progression. Pupils also regularly complain of being taught by classroom assistants, who are there to support qualified teachers; not to shoulder the responsibility of delivering the lesson. This is unfair on the classroom assistant and unfair on the pupils. In accordance with guidance no matters other than those raised in the petition can be discussed. Note also that discussion that may refer to individual members of staff, parents or pupils will not be allowed. I look forward to a beneficial and positive meeting. Yours sincerely, . Dyfrig Siencyn - Chairman .","Parents at Ysgol y Gader school, Wales, created petition about absent staff .

"By . Sara Malm . Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has stepped into the reported family feud following the death of Nelson Mandela, saying that the oldest child will head the clan – not his oldest living male relative. The ex-wife of the human rights icon said Makaziwe Mandela, 60, the only living child from Mandela’s first marriage to Evelyn Mase, will take charge. It has previously been reported that Nelson Mandela’s oldest male heir, grandson Mandla Mandela, would take over as head of the family. Taking a stand: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has said that oldest living child Makaziwe will become the head of the Mandela family - not the oldest male descendant, grandson Mandla . Ms Madikizela-Mandela denied that the . family is engaged in a ‘succession or dynasty’ battle, refuting claims . in media of a feud. ‘In . accordance with customary law and tradition the eldest daughter, being . Ms. Makaziwe Mandela, will head the family and will make decisions with . the support of her two sisters. 'To this end there is no . misunderstanding, or debate.

"By . Sam Webb . Former deputy speaker Nigel Evans entered the witness box today and told a jury that he had not raped or sexually assaulted anyone. The 56-year-old is alleged to have sexually assaulted seven young men on various dates between 2002 and last year by using his 'powerful' political influence to take advantage of them, often while drunk. In his trial at Preston Crown Court he denies one rape, two indecent assaults, five sexual assaults and one attempted sexual assault. A court artist's sketch of former deputy speaker of the House of Commons Nigel Evans appearing at Preston Crown Court today. He faces nine charges, dating from 2002 to last year, of sexual offences against seven men . His barrister, Peter Wright QC, asked him: 'Have you sexually assaulted anyone in terms of the allegations set out here, Mr Evans?' The MP replied: 'No, Mr Wright.' Mr Wright then asked: 'Have you raped anyone?' Evans repeated: 'No, Mr Wright.' The Swansea-born MP confirmed that he had no previous convictions and had not been arrested before these events. Addressing the rape claim, Mr Wright said: 'The principal allegation here that you face is having raped and sexually assaulted a young man. Did you have sexual contact with him?' Mr Evans arrives at Preston Crown Court. He denies one rape, two indecent assaults, five sexual assaults and one attempted sexual assault . The MP said: 'Yes, I did.' The barrister continued: 'Did you engage in sexual intercourse with him?' Evans repeated: 'Yes, I did.' Mr Wright asked: 'Was that in the bedroom of your house?' Evans said: 'Yes, it was in Pendleton.' Mr Wright said: 'In terms of that activity, was it with or without his consent?' Mr Evans told a jury that he had not raped or sexually assaulted anyone . The MP said: 'Absolutely with consent.' Mr Wright went on: 'And in terms of your belief to his consent, was there ever any indication that he was not consenting?' Evans replied: 'Absolutely not.' The MP also denied to the jury that he committed two further sexual assaults against the rape complainant on the same night. Evans agreed that he did have sex with one 22-year-old man he is said to have raped.Mr Wright continued: 'Was it with or without his consent?' Evans replied: 'Absolutely with consent.' Mr Wright said he would begin by putting to the defendant a 'general review of the nature of the case' against him. The prosecutor asked him about the allegation that he sexually assaulted a bisexual young man on the sofa at his house in Pendleton, Lancashire, in July 2009. Evans accepted that he made an 'approach' and that he touched the complainant. Mr Wright said: 'Was the touching sexual?' Evans replied: 'It depends how you interpret that, if I may explain. 'I did get under the duvet or blanket and I did put my arm around him. 'We laid together for a while with my arm around him and his hand holding mine. When my hand started to move down, he slowly brushed it away.' The MP said he held the young man before moving his hand down again. Evans added: 'That's when he exploded and said ""No"".' The MP said his hand got no further down than the top of the young man's belt - though the complainant has told the jury that Evans fondled his penis. Mr Wright continued: 'Was there any further attempt to engage in sexual activity?' Evans replied with a dismissive laugh: 'Hah! No. Not only not on that night but never again.' Mr Wright then turned to what he called 'general matters' dealing with Evans's family background. Evans said he was born in Swansea and educated at local schools. As soon as his head could be seen above the counter, he was involved in helping to run the family grocery shop, started by his grandfather in the 1930s - which he described as something like the store in Open All Hours. He said all the newspapers would be in the shop, which he thought sparked his interest in current affairs and politics - and he joined the Young Conservatives at the age of 17. He denied raping one of the men and said they had had consensual sex . Evans said: 'I always thought it was God's little joke - he made me born in Swansea and born a Tory. There's not many Tories in Swansea.' He told the court he was unsuccessful several times in running for office as both a councillor and an MP until he was finally elected as MP for Ribble Valley in 1992. Evans spoke of his 'co-ordinated' revelation in public via a Mail on Sunday article in December 2010 that he was gay. He told the jury: 'I struggled with it over many years, whether I should come out or not. 'My mum was in her 80s, there was no right time. I just did not want to upset her. I didn't know how she would take it.' But he said he now thought it would not have been a problem and was sorry he had not told her. He continued: 'When she died on March 27 2009 that was a period for me to start to reflect when it was an appropriate time to finally come out at some stage. 'It's not that nobody knew. 'It's been referred to as an open secret in Westminster but some people knew and other people didn't know.' Evans was later asked about the stage of his political career when he left his post as shadow secretary of state for Wales . He said that, following his decision to go public, he informed his family, members of his constituency association and Prime Minister David Cameron. Evans was later asked about the stage of his political career when he left his post as shadow secretary of state for Wales. The MP said: ""Michael Howard (then Tory leader) decided to have a reshuffle of the shadow cabinet. 'It was much more major than that. He decided to deconstruct much of the shadow cabinet. He slimlined it and merged most of the posts.' Mr Wright asked him: 'Were you demoted?' Evans replied: 'I decided to return to the backbenches. 'When I knew the position was not going to remain, I was unhappy. 'I already had problems with the Welsh Assembly leader of the Conservatives there. 'I thought it was a demotion for Wales and I was not prepared to take that. Wales deserved better. 'Michael Howard offered me the job again but outside the shadow cabinet. 'I explained why I could not take it and handed in my resignation letter."" Before the 2010 general election he opted to put his name forward in the election of deputy speakers of the House of Commons. He said: 'I thought ""Here is an opportunity to be involved in the day-to-day running of Parliament on a much bigger basis"".' The subject later turned to the MP's social life. Mr Wright asked him if there was any 'age profile' to the people he would mix with. Evans replied: 'I would probably say not.' He said he was just as likely to be playing dominos in his local pub with people in their 70s as mixing with those in their 20s. Mr Wright said: 'There has been evidence that you have been drunk on occasion. Have you been drunk on occasion?' Evans said: 'Probably.' His barrister continued: 'On and off the parliamentary estate?' Evans said: 'Yes.' Mr Wright said: 'Again at Conservative Party conferences?' The MP said: 'The party conferences are not just politics that you see on the television. They are social events. It is an opportunity for the party workers, the MPs and ministers to meet. 'Therefore, there is absolutely nothing peculiar to people drinking at party conferences. 'It is not just the Conservatives. It is all party conferences.'

"By . Peter Allen . France’s tax authorities have launched a 1 billion euro tax claim against Google, it was reported today. It follows financial inspectors searching the Paris offices of the internet giant in June 2011 as it investigated their accounting. Google has reduced the amount of tax it pays in France by channelling its revenue through a Dutch-registered intermediary and then to a Bermuda-registered holding, Google Ireland Limited, before reporting it in low-tax Ireland. Paying up: Google has been channelling its French revenue through a Dutch intermediary and then to a Bermuda-registered holding, before reporting it in Ireland, an investigation found . Socialist France is currently one of the highest taxed countries in the world, with the top rate of income tax standing at 75 per cent. According to court documents obtained by AFP, the French national news agency, Google France reported 192.9 million euros of revenue in 2012, and paid 6.5 million euros in tax on the 8.3 million euros of net profit it earned. Analysts have meanwhile estimated that Google generated up to 1.4 billion in revenue in France in 2011, mainly through advertising. Respected news magazine Le Point reports the claim by the French tax authorities, and these have been followed up by other media across the country. Je t'aime le tax: The French government under socialist President Francois Hollande has raised the highest income tax to 75 per cent . The Paris exchequer refused to comment, saying anyone’s tax affairs are confidential. A spokesman for Google declined to comment too. President Francois Hollande has led his country to economic ruin since his election in 2012. The unemployment rate is currently more than 11 per cent, while the cost of living is also spiralling . Figures released last week showed that foreign investment in France in 2013 – Mr Hollande’s first full year in power – was down by 77 per cent. Faced with huge debts, France is determined to clamp down on multinational companies who avoid having to hand over huge parts of their income to failing national governments.","Google found to have channeled French revenue to Ireland .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Donna Canavan-McClung, 32, was found hanged in a cemetery after her partner said she would press domestic abuse charges . A woman who married her lesbian lover in one of Britain’s first same sex weddings was found hanged in a cemetery, more than a year after the marriage fell apart, a coroner heard today. Donna Canavan-McClung had divorced her partner of nine years and started a 'volatile' relationship with a new girlfriend who filed a domestic abuse complaint against her days before she died, an inquest into her death heard. Mrs Canavan-McClung, 32, married mother-of-two Colleen Canavan in 2006, months after the law was changed to allow gay civil ceremonies in the UK.  But the marriage broke down after five years and they divorced in February last year. Mrs Canavan-McClung, a lifeguard and swimming teacher who had recently lost her job, began a new relationship with a woman called Miranda Yardley, which, Dorset coroner Sherriff Payne said, was 'volatile'. The new couple lived together most of the time but often fell out and had violent rows, the inquest heard. Their problems came to a head this October when Miss Yardley went to the police claiming she was a victim of domestic abuse, before sending her lover a text saying she was bringing domestic abuse charges against her. Mrs Canavan-McClung was upset by the news and told relations that she would 'go on the run' rather than be arrested, the coroner heard. Her mother, Beth Rowles said: 'Miranda had contacted her and told her she had spent four hours in a police station pressing charges against Donna over a domestic problem, which frightened Donna and which is why she ran off. 'She could not face being arrested.  Her opinion, as far as we know, was ""What’s the point of being here?""' The inquest heard that Mrs Canavan-McClung had been prescribed anti-depressants after losing the job she loved at a local leisure centre earlier this year. Her mother said she was 'tipped over the edge' when Miss Yardley turned up at her home and dumped her belongings on the driveway in the middle of the night on 7 October. The inquest heard Mrs Canavan-McClung had sent a final text message to her mother saying: 'What’s the point? I’ve had enough. Nothing good ever happens to me. I will get the blame anyway.' Two days later she sent a worrying text message to her father, and police later found her hanging in Weymouth Cemetery at 9.15pm that night, the inquest heard. Friends and relations of Donna Canavan-McClung including her mother, in striped top, and former wife attended the inquest . PC Michael Holman, of Dorset Police, told the coroner in a statement: 'I could see a figure hanging'. 'She was warm to the touch. I concluded she had not been in this position for very long.' Officers cut her down 'with great difficulty', but she was declared dead at the scene. CCTV footage from the supermarket in Weymouth showed Mrs Canavan-McClung on her own in the store at 7pm on the night she died, buying items she used to kill herself, the inquest heard. A post-mortem examination and toxicology test on the body found she had 174mg of alcohol per 100ml of her blood in her system at the time of her death, more than twice the legal driving limit. 'She had reached a crisis point and she had seen a message that the police were likely to arrest her.' - Dorset coroner Sherriff Payne . Summing up the case at Dorchester County Hall, the Dorset coroner said: 'She had a long-term relationship with another woman, which failed, and was then involved in another relationship which seems to have been marred by various episodes of disputes between then and much unpleasantness. 'Close to the time of her death, matters were getting very difficult for her. She had not got settled accommodation for the future, and she was involved in a dispute with her new partner about her belongings and possessions. 'She had reached a crisis point and she had seen a message that the police were likely to arrest her. She became very alarmed by this and so she was going on the run. 'During the course of 9 October, she left various messages with members of her family and this woman to the effect that she was going to kill herself. 'The family understandably became concerned and informed the police, who began a search. 'She was subsequently found in the cemetery. She was quite clearly dead.' He added: 'I’m sure that she knew what she was doing. She knew that this was going to end her life and therefore she has taken her own life. She has committed suicide.'

"By . Lucy Crossley . Hero: Bethan Woolford (pictured) heard Robyn Jeffrey's cries for help and leapt from her car to catch one-year-old Harley as his mother dropped him from the first floor window of the burning home . A young mother made a desperate plea for a passer-by to catch her baby son as she dropped him from the window of her burning home. Frightened Robyn Jeffrey shouted for help through the top floor window as flames and smoke filled her family's house. Fortunately, Bethan Woolford, 20, heard 17-year-old Ms Jeffrey's cries and leapt from her car to catch one-year-old Harley as his mother dropped him from the first floor window of the burning home in Harlow, Essex. Ms Woolford had been driving to work when she saw the drama and ran to help, telling Ms Jeffrey to drop the child into her arms. She caught the little boy safely as a van driver also stopped and put his ladder against the wall of the house to rescue Ms Jeffrey. 'This girl opened the window and screamed ""My baby's in here!,"" said care worker Ms Woolford. 'I told her to chuck him down. She said she couldn't do it but I swore I'd catch him. 'She held him out the window and let go. I caught him round his waist. It was just instinct, I didn't really think about it. 'Afterwards Harley was just laughing. He thought it was hilarious. I think he wanted another go.' Ms Jeffrey said: 'I woke up to find thick black smoke everywhere. 'There was no other way to escape except my bedroom window on the middle floor. 'I couldn't see anything because the smoke was so thick. 'I went to the window and I was just screaming ""Help me, my baby is in here"". Grateful: Robyn Jeffrey (pictured centre with her son Harvey) and the rest of her family, Stephanie Jeffrey, Raina Jeffrey, Alan Durack and Rebecca Jeffrey . 'I shouted ""please catch my baby"". She said I promise I will and she caught him.' The house was gutted by fire, but Ms Jeffrey and her family have been able to find a new home following the fire last Thursday. A joint investigation by the fire brigade and police is underway to determine the cause of the blaze. The mother-of-one said dropping Harley was 'the most difficult decision of her life' but she knew she had no other option. She added: 'I just don't know how to say thanks to her. She's such a hero in my eyes. 'I wouldn't have jumped, I just don't think I could have done it. It was the hardest day of my life but I'm so glad my little boy came to no harm.'

"By . Miles Goslett . Controversial: Former director-general Mark Thompson, 56, left the BBC in September 2012 after eight years in charge . The BBC is under fire for agreeing to spend £20,000 of licence fee money on an official portrait of former director-general Mark Thompson. The 56-year-old, who left the corporation in September 2012 after eight years in charge, has been advised by senior executives that the public will foot the five-figure bill for the commissioned work. It has been a tradition for director generals to have an official portrait since the first man to hold the post, Lord Reith, sat for an artist in the 1930s. Thompson – now chief executive of the New York Times, where he earned an estimated $6 million (£3.7million) including a bonus during his first year in charge – is currently choosing which artist will depict him on canvas. The picture is intended to hang in Broadcasting House, the BBC's headquarters in central London, and insiders have indicated that at least £20,000 is available for the exercise. But critics have lambasted the idea, insisting millionaire Mr Thompson should pay for it himself. Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the Commons media select committee, said: 'No public money should be spent on this. The BBC has already accepted that Mark Thompson was an overpaid director-general. 'We know this because although his salary was as high as £834,000 at one point, his successor is paid only £450,000. Mark Thompson should pay for this picture out of the additional funds he received which even the BBC now admits were unjustified.' Rob Wilson MP, an aide to chancellor George Osborne, said he objected to the portrait being paid for with public money in part because of the various BBC scandals with which Thompson is associated, such as the inquiry into Jimmy Savile's sex abuse, illegal executive pay-offs, and the £100million Digital Media Initiative fiasco. Mr Wilson said: 'In light of what we now know about Mark Thompson's tenure, I would suggest that if he wishes to have a BBC portrait he should pay for it himself. 'There may be a tradition of commissioning portraits of director-generals, but I think it's an anachronism in this day and age. It smacks of an elitist, almost imperial culture at the top of the BBC that glorifies itself and its leadership rather than focussing on the people it serves.' It has been a tradition for director generals to have an official portrait since the first man to hold the post, Lord Reith, sat for an artist in the 1930s . George Entwistle, who succeeded Thompson in September 2012 but was forced to quit after 54 days over the Lord McAlpine scandal, has not been granted an official BBC portrait. Thompson's predecessor, Greg Dyke, spent £15,000 of public money on his official BBC portrait, painted by John Keane and unveiled in 2006. Although Thompson left at a time of his choosing, his BBC track record has been scrutinised like none of his predecessors'. He has been forced to return to London from his new base in New York three times in 15 months to give evidence to official inquiries into BBC scandals. The first related to Savile. Thompson said he knew nothing about the abuse allegations surrounding the late DJ until after he stopped running the BBC. However, legal papers plus statements to MPs from his colleague Helen Boaden, the BBC's head of Radio, have since surfaced which contradict his story. Thompson was also in charge of the BBC when £25 million in golden goodbyes was paid to 150 departing executives, some of whom were not entitled to the six-figure sums they received. He was grilled about this by MPs last September and has subsequently been accused of misleading their committee, an allegation he is still battling. And on Monday he was in London to give evidence to the same parliamentary committee about the Digital Media Initiative IT project, in which £100 million of licence fee money was written off. Thompson apologised for the catastrophe, but MPs say his precise role in the affair remains unclear.","The 56-year-old left in September 2012 after eight years in charge .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The BBC licence fee should be scrapped and replaced with a voluntary subscription service, TV presenter Nick Ross has claimed. The former host of Crimewatch warned support for the BBC would ‘fall off a cliff’ if the mandatory charge for all owners of a television set is not axed. But the Corporation hit back saying the change would mean fewer people paying much more each year to maintain a quality service. Ex-Crimewatch host Nick Ross said people who support the BBC could change their minds if the licence fee is not scrapped . Viewers must buy a TV licence £145.50 licence if they want to watch live broadcasts. But they can legally avoid paying by waiting until their favourite show is available on BBC iPlayer instead. The rise of rival subscription services including Sky, Virgin Media, BT and Netflix has also raised questions about the viability of a compulsory charge for the BBC. Wrangling over the future of the licence fee is expected to build in the run up to the renewal of the BBC royal charter in 2017. Ross argues that the flat fee for every home should be replaced with a pay-per-view or subscroiption charge, which he claims could raise more than the current £3.6billion. Ross told the Sunday Times: ‘I'm one of the few people calling for the abolition of the licence fee who are doing this because they treasure the BBC. ‘The experience of BSkyB is that people will voluntarily pay far more than they will under criminal sanction, and easily enough to promote and subsidise the encrypted radio-receiver technology that would need to be phased in. ‘People who support the BBC now could change their minds; this would be pretty dangerous for the BBC,’ he added. The BBC¿s iPlayer website received a record three billion requests for free online programmes last year, reigniting fears viewers will stop paying the TV licence fee . However a BBC spokesman warned: ‘While subscription might initially appeal to some, it would actually lead to more expensive fees paid for by fewer people. 'The licence fee is effective and good value and continues to be the best way to fund the BBC.' Ross is only the latest senior figure with links to the BBC calling for an overhaul of the licenece fee. Question Time host David Dimblbely last year called on the director-general Tony Hall to hand out the licence fee to its commercial rivals to create ‘more variety’ in TV and radio output. It came after former head of TV news Roger Mosey admitted the BBC was too big and too left wing, and also suggested the licence fee should be shared with rivals and the number of TV channels reduced.","Licence fee 'should be replaced with pay-per-view or subscription'

"By . Katy Winter . A woman has lost an incredible 19.8st - more than half her 43st body weight - following dangerous weight loss surgery . Morbidly obese Tara Taylor, 35, developed a complex and deeply unhealthy relationship with food after being raped at the age of 26, using food to comfort herself and her size as a way of protecting herself from the world. But after her son Darren, six, told her that all his classmates called her fat, Tara made the decision to lose weight for the sake of her children. Tara's 43st weight meant she was mainly confined to her bed and in near constant pain . Tara dropped from 43.2st (left) to 23.4st (left) in the course of 12 months after opting for risky bypass surgery . The mother-of-two, from Lafayette in Louisiana, had tipped the scales at a staggering 606lbs (43.2st) and suffered from numerous health problems that left her bed bound and unable to care for her children. She could barely walk and spent most of her days in bed while her mother Paula cooked her meals and cared for the children. Speaking on TLC's My 600lb Life ahead of the operation, Tara said: 'I’m disgusted with myself. If I could cut it off I would. 'There’s a lot of things in my life that’s hard and because of my size I don’t do much of anything. Basically my day in stuck in the bed. 'I’m in constant pain. My weight has worn . down the cartilage in my knees so when I walk it is literally bone on . bone. My back hurts because my stomach hangs so far down. I’m just . tired.' Tara used food as an emotional crutch and her size as a means of protection against the world . Worse, Tara also said her children, Darren and Felicity, were missing out on being raised by their mother with grandmother Paula doing the bulk of the childcare instead. ‘She . does everything for them,' explained Tara. 'But she’s getting too old to be doing what . she’s doing - I should be taking care of her. 'I want to be there for my . children. I want to see them play sports and see them grow up. 'Ever since I can remember I have been . overweight,' she continued. 'It didn’t really dawn on me about my size until when I was . 13 years old I stepped on the scales and it read 187.5lb [13st 4lbs] but I just . brushed it off. When I graduated high school I was 352lb [25st 1lb]. 'My . food is an addiction. Food doesn’t judge me whether I’m happy or sad, . angry, upset- I always have food. Food has always been my safe haven.' But although she'd always been big, the trigger for the weight gain that took her to a massive 43st 2lb was a traumatic rape at the age of 26. After becoming pregnant by her rapist, Tara then suffered a miscarriage and in the aftermath, began eating more 'to feel safe and unattractive' to men. Tara also felt her size meant she was missing out on raising daughter Felicity and son Darren, who had to interact with her on her bed . Although Tara's mother prepared most of her food, Tara, who admitted she ate 6 times a day, was able to cook for herself sitting down . ‘When I was 26 I was raped and I got pregnant from the rape and had a miscarriage,' she revealed. 'I . was heavy, but afterwards I just got heavier. I felt that if I got more . unattractive no man would want to touch me and I would be safe. 'It made me not care. I didn’t care about anyone else's feelings. After I eat I feel disgusted, angry at myself. I beat myself up about it.’ Despite her size - and her inability to cook for herself - Tara's mother Paula says she felt unable to deny her requests for food. ‘I’m helping her to stay like she is . because it is hard to serve her and tell her, ""That’s all you can have"",' she explained. 'I . always end up giving into her… she’s my child.’ With dieting made difficult by her situation, Tara travelled to Texas to consult leading bariatric surgeon, Dr Younan Nowazaradan in a bid to lose weight. Tara shopping using a scooter with her mother Paula (left) and daughter Felicity (right) Tara travelled to Texas to meet with Dr Nowzaradan, who described her condition as 'critical' and undergo surgery . Demanding that she make an effort to change her unhealthy habits on her own before undergoing surgery, Dr Nowzaradan instructed Tara – who admitted she ate at least six times a day- to lose 20lbs in a month at home. ‘Tara’s conditional is critical. If she doesn’t start to lose weight, I don’t think she will live another five years,’ he warned. The surgery, which left her with a stomach the size of a boiled egg, was a success, although Tara admits she did have trouble adapting to her new diet at first. ‘Changing your eating habits is hard, especially when your whole life you have turned to food to make you happy,’ she explained. Despite disappointing initial weight loss, Tara's surgery goes ahead, with her son admitting to her at her bedside that he is teased at school over her size . Tara's weight led to complications during surgery, but it was a success; reducing the size of Tara's stomach to about the same as a boiled egg . Despite a bumpy start to sticking to her diet, Tara eventually becomes committed, walking more and even starting at a gym . A year later, Tara has lost almost half her body weight, and can now walk around the supermarket instead of having to ride on a scooter, and can help her son get ready for school in the morning. ‘A year ago I was at the lowest point in my life,' she says. 'I will never forget who that 600lb person was; I will always love her but I sure won’t miss her. ‘Now I have a world of possibilities and I just can’t wait to start living my life.'

"By . Claire Ellicott . UPDATED: . 01:38 EST, 2 August 2011 . When Elsie Campbell began having cravings for lettuce, she thought it was a passing fancy. Even when it became an obsession that saw her eating four whole lettuces a day, she still tried to shrug it off  as harmless. Luckily for Mrs Campbell, her husband Jim, a research scientist, suspected there might be something more to it. Jim Campbell realised his wife's sudden love of lettuce could be her body's way of signalling she was suffering from a more serious health problem . He worked out that lettuce contains a . particular nutrient that is lacking in breast cancer sufferers and that . his wife’s urge to eat so much of it could mean she was suffering from . the disease. After a visit to her doctor, the . mother of three was diagnosed with breast cancer, but has now made a . full recovery thanks to the early diagnosis. She credits her husband’s . quick-thinking for saving her life. ‘I woke up one day and suddenly fancied some lettuce,’ said Mrs Campbell, a 59-year-old accounts assistant. ‘I’d always eaten it in salads, but . suddenly, I just couldn’t get enough of it. I could eat three or four . whole lettuces a day. I’d eat a whole iceberg lettuce at work, and sit . on the bus on the way home thinking about eating more and more. ‘I’d get home and cut one into chunks and eat it like a watermelon. ‘I knew something wasn’t quite right – and my husband and my sons started to get quite worried about me. ‘Jim started investigating which . nutrients and minerals were found in lettuce – and realised they  were . the same ones that your body can be deprived of when it is fighting . cancer.’ Mrs Campbell, from Derby, added: ‘Not . long afterwards, I discovered a small dimple on my breast – and my . doctor confirmed I had  breast cancer. ‘It’s only now that I realise my body . was making me eat lettuce to combat the cancer. It was like my body was . trying to cure itself.’ Mr Campbell has now created a website, . questionmyhealth.com, that he says can help identify if users are . suffering from a nutrient deficiency caused by something more serious. The website asks users to answer a . series of questions about themselves – such as whether they have white . spots on their fingernails, whether they have a high libido, or whether . they crave Marmite. It then analyses the answers and warns of any . minerals or vitamins the user may be deficient in – and what that  could . mean. Elsie Campbell, 59, developed a sudden inexplicable craving for lettuce. Her husband realised she could be deficient in sulforaphane . The scientist, who has also written a . book on nutrient deficiencies, hopes the site will help others spot . potential diseases and cancers while they are still in the early stages. Mr Campbell said: ‘Some chronic . diseases, like diabetes and Alzheimer’s, can take 20 years to develop, . but your body can give you a clue to what you are dealing with early on . if you know what to look for.’ He added: ‘As a scientist, I know that . everything has to have a cause and effect. Elsie didn’t start eating . lettuce for no reason, so I started to do some research in which . minerals and vitamins are found in it. ‘I discovered lettuce, like a lot of . green veg, contains sulforaphane – which can attack cancer cells. I . wondered if that was the reason why her body was craving it and . suggested that Elsie visited the doctor. ‘Coincidentally, she discovered the . small dimple on her breast the same day. We were devastated when the . doctors told us she had cancer – but relieved that they managed to catch . it so early. ‘Her lettuce cravings really were a . warning sign – if she hadn’t suspected something was wrong, she would . have probably never found the dimple, or certainly would not have been . so concerned about it.’ Mrs Campbell, whose lettuce craving began in 2004, was diagnosed with breast cancer in early 2005. She had the small lump removed from her breast and had months of treatment but has now been given the all-clear. She added: ‘Strangely, since the lump . was removed, I haven’t wanted to eat a single lettuce leaf – the . craving’s completely vanished. ‘I was so lucky Jim spotted the signs when he did – my lettuce addiction probably saved my life.’","Scientist husband realised his wife's craving could be a sign she was fighting a serious illness .

"By . Associated Press . For the residents of a sleepy upstate New York town, the Christmas film It's a Wonderful Life has a special place in their hearts. Those living in Seneca Falls believe their homely town, with its steel truss bridge and broad main street, is where Frank Capra based his classic film. And, while a direct connection between the director and the town can't be confirmed, it doesn't stop its 9,000 residents celebrating the movie every Christmas. Scroll down for video . Christmas classic: Every year residents of Seneca Falls dress up as characters from It's a Wonderful Life and parade through their town . Heartwarming: Clarence the Angel (Henry Travers), left, and George Bailey (James Stewart) in the 1946 film . Those in Seneca Falls believe George Bailey's fictional hometown of Bedford Falls was heavily inspired by their own town. Seneca Falls in New York claims to have been the inspiration for Capra's 1946 film. The town has similar features to the fictional Bedford Falls, including a steel truss bridge, broad Main Street, and railroad station. Characters in the film also refer to nearby towns such as Rochester and Elmira. Local barber Tommy Bellissima is believed to have cut Frank Capra's hair when the director passed through the town in 1945. In 1917, Seneca Falls resident Antonio Varacalli saved a woman's life after she jumped from the town's bridge - an act seemingly reflected in the 1946 film. A plaque commemorates Varacalli, who died after getting the woman to safety. Each year bells are run in the town to remember him as 'an angel who got his wings'. Seneca Falls holds a weekend celebration based around the classic film every December. Every year, members of the community dress as characters including Clarence the Angel and mean Mr Potter, for a parade down the Main Street. They even mark the end of the festival with a ringing of the bells in memory of Antonio Varacalli, who saved a woman's life in 1917, and to honor 'angels' nominated by current residents. 'Capra always said Bedford Falls represented little slices of small towns that he had visited all across America. We're not in a position to dispute that,' Francis Caraccilo, a trustee for the town's It's a Wonderful Life Museum, said. 'We just think we're a bigger slice.' While there's no definitive proof . that Capra ever set foot in Seneca Falls, local barber Tommy Bellissima . claimed he cut the director's hair in 1945, as he passed through on his . way to visit an aunt. Mr Bellissima, . who died in 2011, didn't initially know the customer he chatted with . was famous, but the surname Capra stuck in his head because it means . 'goat' in Italian. The 1946 film starred Jimmy Stewart as Bailey, a small-town, frustrated banker who realizes his life's value after Clarence shows him what would become of Bedford Falls if he had never been born. The homey town falls into the clutches of the greedy slumlord Potter, and his Pottersville becomes a city of sin, with sleazy nightclubs, burlesque halls, pawn shops and neon lights. Christmas spirit: Sean Kennedy dresses as character Henry Potter for the annual parade . Parade: Actors dress in costumes inspired by the film for an annual celebration in Seneca Falls . Connection: The steel truss bridge in Seneca Falls, above, is similar to the one in the film, below . Hero: In an act similar to the film's plot, Seneca Falls resident Antonio Varacalli saved a woman's life after she jumped from the town's bridge. In the film, Clarence the Angel jumps in so George Bailey will rescue him . If Bedford Falls - the nice one, not the naughty one - really was modeled after Seneca Falls, Capra never let on before his death in 1991. But there are striking similarities. Seneca Falls has a broad main street like Bedford Falls, and its bridge has a plaque dedicated to a man who lost his life by diving in after a suicidal woman in 1917 - an act echoed in the film. Karolyn Grimes, who played Bailey's daughter Zuzu in the movie and is a festival regular, said the similarities were so striking that she blurted out 'It's Bedford Falls!' during her first visit. The film also has references to nearby upstate cities. The bank examiner wants to get back to his family in Elmira for Christmas. George's wealthy friend Sam Wainwright talks of building a factory outside Rochester, and his brother is offered a job in Buffalo. Bedford Falls also has a Genesee Street. The word ""genesee"" is from the Iroquois and is closely associated with the Finger Lakes region that includes Seneca Falls. Popular: Nearly 3,000 people, pictured coming across the bridge, took part in a fun run as part of the town's festivities on Saturday . Classic: George Bailey with his family in It's a Wonderful Life . Stamp of approval: A festive postmark highlights the town's claims to have been the inspiration for fictional Bedford Falls . Seasonal attraction: The weekend festival celebrating the film brings in visitors including Mary Owen, center, the daughter of actress Donna Reed, who played Mary Hatch . Festive: The holiday classic, starring James Stewart, left, and Donna Reed, center, was made in 1946 . Perhaps fitting for a Christmas story, the contention that Seneca Falls is the real Bedford Falls comes down to belief. 'There just is no evidence to support it, but God bless them,' Jeanine Basinger, curator of the Frank Capra Archive at Wesleyan University and author of The It's a Wonderful Life Book, said. Ms Basinger said Capra was a meticulous record keeper, yet she has never come across the link in his records, diary entries or script notes - not to mention the many conversations she had with Capra over years. 'I hate being in the role of Mr Potter. I'm sorry, everybody. I wish I could say: ""Eureka! And here it is!"" But the fact is there is absolutely no evidence to confirm this,' she said. It's also possible that Capra might have known of Bedford Hills, a hamlet in the moneyed community of Bedford (think Sam Wainwright) north of New York City.

But Evelyne Ryan, executive director of the Bedford Historical Society, said that the place is not similar to Bedford Falls and that a case has never been seriously made. It's also possible Bedford Falls was meant to be an ideal, not a place. Ms Basinger noted that the great thing about It's a Wonderful Life is that everyone feels it's their hometown. And that's just fine to some Seneca Falls partisans. 'We're OK not having proof. In fact, maybe having a little mystery behind it makes it even better,' Mr Caraccilo said.

"By . Katy Winter . It’s official, the UK is full of adoring mummy’s boys. Men are more likely to buy their mother a gift this Mother’s Day (47 per cent) than bought their partner a gift last Valentines (44 per cent), suggesting mum is still their number one girl. Men up and down the country claim it is easier to buy presents for their mum than their partner, with more than a quarter (27 per cent) citing their other half as the most difficult person to buy for. British boys, like Russell Brand and One Direction's Louis Tomlinson, are always mummy's boys at heart (left, Russell with his mother Barbara Elizabeth, and right, Louis with mother Johannah Poulston) On average, men admit to spending £26 on a gift for Mother’s Day, with one in ten (10 per cent) spending £50 or more on their mother. And it would seem that the boys are edging ahead of the girls when it comes to getting in their mother’s good books, with women admitting to spending slightly less on a Mother’s Day gift (£23). And with more than a quarter of Britons (27 per cent) admitting that they usually purchase gifts using their credit card, choosing the right card is more important than ever. Nerys Lewis, head of credit cards at Confused.com, who conducted the research, comments: 'It seems that we do indeed have a nation of mummy’s boys! While it is traditionally daughters who are seen to be the more caring of the sexes, this year it is boys who will be splashing out on their Mums and putting the girls to shame.'

Hannah Foxley, who recently had a mastectomy, says she wants to show women you can still be beautiful even when you’ve had parts of your body removed. The 35-year-old said her world turned upside down when she found a lump in her breast in April 2011. Hannah Foxley, who recently had a mastectomy, has posed naked on the cover of Cosmopolitan to inspire other women . 'I was grieving for . my father, Bill, who’d died five months earlier, when I found a lump in . my breast and was diagnosed with cancer. 'It was like being hit by a . train. It didn’t feel real. Like most young women, I thought I was . invincible,' she told the fashion magazine. She had a lumpectomy and eight cycles of gruelling chemotherapy. Then, a . week before her treatment was due to end, she found a second cancerous lump. She had a mastectomy, followed by five weeks of . radiotherapy. Speaking to MailOnline, she said: 'It was difficult. Losing something that is so key to your femininity takes a lot of coming to terms with.'

While the treatment was successful, she is still . being monitored and is on a waiting list for a reconstruction, which could see her waiting up to twelve months for. Originally she didn't want to consider reconstruction but as time passed, she missed wearing sexy underwear and backless dresses so decided to speak to a plastic surgeon about it. Speaking after the operation, she said: 'I was worried about how my body would look and how men would react. But I also realised I still had a fit, healthy body. The only thing . that had changed was the clothes I could wear.' Hannah recorded her cancer journey with her friend and photographer Justin Paget. They have won a major international award for their raw and emotional portrayal of her journey through treatment and eventual mastectomy - this shows the beginning of her journey . Ten . days after her treatment, she left her job as an employed financial planner and set up The Women's Wealth Expert, which is a fee based financial planning form that specialises in working with high net worth divorcing women, as well as signing up as an ambassador for .

"By . Ruth Styles . After a 24-year career as a desk clerk in the RAF, John Wildey, 77, had spent plenty of time looking at planes but had never taken the controls. But all that changed after a pleasure flight to Skegness turned into a nightmare when Mr Wildey's friend and pilot was suddenly taken ill and died during the flight. Now, six months after making headlines after being forced to make an emergency landing solo and in the dark, Mr Wildey is to tell the full story for the first time as part of a new Channel 4 documentary. Terrifying: John Wildey had a brush with death after his pilot friend tragically passed away during a flight . 'We were having a good flight, we were enjoying it and picking out landmarks. It was just a day out and we were enjoying ourselves,' explains Mr Wildey of the moments leading up to his friend's death. 'It was getting late evening, the weather was good, we had about another hour to get down before the end of daylight.' But just a few miles from the Sandtoft air base where the two men were due to land, disaster struck when the pilot suddenly revealed that he felt ill. 'He said he felt sick, so I said, ""Don't be sick on my trousers!"",' remembers Mr Wildey. 'I asked if we stop should somewhere and he said no, so we went on. 'Then he asked me to take the controls for a moment and then he leaned back and started breathing rapidly. Flights to and from Humberside were suspended or diverted as the runway was cleared for an emergency landing . Mr Wildey was guided to safety by two flying instructors who had been called in to help land the aircraft at Humberside Airport . 'He began hyperventilating and threw his head back. I thought he'd fainted or something at first and then I tried to feel for a pulse because his hand was hanging down. 'I just thought, ""Well what do I do now?"" I thought, ""I'm going to have to fly this thing."" It was a Houston, we have a problem moment. I pressed the transmit button on the console and I called: Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.' Emergency services were quickly scrambled on the ground but Mr Wildey had to be diverted to the bigger airport at Humberside, where the runways were swiftly cleared of traffic in anticipation of a crash landing. 'I was trying to keep as calm as possible . because I knew if I didn't, I'd lose everything,' adds Mr Wildey. 'I've had my skin for . 77 years and I'd like to keep it for a few more years.' By now, Mr Wildey's Cessna aircraft had been joined by an RAF Search and Rescue team from nearby RAF Leconfield while in the control tower at Humberside, instructor Russell Murray had arrived to coach Mr Whitley through the perilous descent. Roy Murray, chief instructor at the airport's Frank Morgan Flying School was called at his home in the Waltham, Lincolnshire . 'I was OK guiding the plane but landing was a different proposition,' says Mr Wildey. 'I just couldn't . position myself. And I was looking for the runway but I couldn't see a . thing. I don't know how I high I was. All I could see was the black.' After three aborted landing attempts, Mr Wildey was becoming increasingly thirsty and tired, while on the ground, his would-be rescuers were preparing for the worst. 'I could have paid a million quid for a . drink at that time,' he remembers. 'I think it was the adrenaline kicking in but I was . so dry that it hurt.' One-and-a-half hours after first taking control of the plane, Mr Wildey geared up for his fourth attempt at landing. 'I didn't want to go round again if I could help it. I just wanted to come in and get down - and I was gagging for a drink,' he says. Former RAF ground crewman John Wildey, 77, landed the light aircraft he had been a passenger in after the pilot collapsed at the controls . 'I . brought it down to do the approach and it was then I could hear them . [air traffic control] say, ""He's diving now"". I just thought, ""It's going down now, I'm doing . it - just get down!""' One bumpy landing that saw the Cessna skew off the runway and into a patch of grass later, and Mr Wildey's nightmare was finally over. But his relief that he was alive was tinged with sadness as his pilot friend, rushed to hospital by medics, was pronounced dead later that night. Mr Wildey, by contrast, is relieved he's still alive. 'It . was an Andy Warhol moment for me wasn't it,' he sighs. 'Iâ€™m a pretty lucky bloke . anyway - I went and bought a lottery ticket that week and got Â£6.70 so . there must be something right.'

"By . Ruth Styles . From Marni's embrace of graphic artist Brian Rea to Prada's emphasis on pop art prints, fashion that nods to the art world is bang on trend. But although it might appear to be a modern phenomenon, fashion's love affair with art began more than a century ago, with Andy Warhol, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali among the names to have turned their hand to textile design, . Now creations by Dali, Warhol and Picasso are to join pieces by Marc Chagall, Henry Matisse and Yorkshire sculptor Henry Moore in a stunning new exhibition opening tomorrow. Wearable art: ‘Ballerina’, a screen-printed silk scarf designed by Salvador Dali for Wesley Simpson circa 1947 . Artist Textiles: Picasso to Warhol documents fashion's early fascination with art and includes designs by Warhol that, until recently, languished in the attic of a family of New York decorators. The creations, which include a delicate pattern of repeating blue butterflies, were unearthed by curator Richard Chamberlain, and were commissioned by fabric companies eager to sell their customers a wearable piece of modern art. 'The Warhol pieces are extremely rare due to them having been lost for so many years and only recently having been discovered,' explains Chamberlain. 'Warhol was already engaged with graphic design, so textile design was another string to his bow,' he adds. 'Whether it was a record cover for the RCA or a textile for Fuller fabrics, Warhol was always willing to satisfy any paying customer.' Spectacular: Designs by Graham Sutherland (left) and Eduardo Paolozzi (right) for Horrockes Fashions . Talented: Salvador Dali, pictured during a 1959 visit to London, designed several sets of textiles . And he wasn't the only one. Spanish surrealist Salvador Dali and Hungarian costume designer Marcel Vertès both created work for New York based Wesley Simpson Custom Fabrics, while in 1947, Henri Matisse designed a limited edition pattern for Ascher Scarves. Other artists to cash in on their talents included Pablo Picasso, who, in a coup for Fuller Fabric boss, Dan Fuller, agreed to contribute to the company's 'Modern Master Prints' series. Although initially reluctant, by the 1960s, shoppers were able to purchase Picasso-designed textiles that could be used for almost anything, with the single exception of upholstery. As Chamberlain puts it: 'Picassos may be leaned against, but not sat on.' Talent: Although Picasso (left) was picky about the use his designs were put to, anything went for Warhol . Delicate: One of the four headsquares designed by Marcel Vertes for Wesley Simpson Custom Fabrics, 1944 . By contrast, Warhol was happy for his work to be put to any use the new owners required and went on to become one of the most referenced artists of the 20th century. 'Warhol continually influences designers,' adds Chamberlain. 'The bright colours and blotted ink lines are very fashionable both in textile design, illustration and graphics.' And Chamberlain isn't wrong. More than 60 years after he first appeared on the scene, all it takes is a swift look at Prada's latest collection to see that Warhol's talent for textiles remains as influential as ever. Artist Textiles: Picasso to Warhol opens tomorrow at the Fashion and Textile Museum. Tickets cost £8 for adults, concessions £6.50. See ftmlondon.org for more information.

"By . Bianca London . Girl power is alive and kicking for one family who have just welcomed yet another baby girl to their female-heavy family. Newborn Pixie-Lee is the fifth generation of a family, from Stockport, Cheshire, who can't stop having girls. Despite her efforts to keep the sex of her baby quiet, it came as no surprise when new mother Katie Moore gave birth to Pixie-Lee on February 28. Newborn Pixie-Lee is joined by mother Katie Donaldson, 24, (right), grandmother Cheryl Donaldson, 48, (back left), great grandmother Lynne Styles, 66, (back right) and great great grandmother Emily Burston, 89 . Mother's Day is now the family's biggest yearly celebration as Pixie-Lee celebrates with mother Katie, 24, grandma Cheryl Donaldson, 48, great-grandma Lynne Styles, 66, and great-great-grandma Emily Burston, 89. During Katie's pregnancy, her female relatives kept their fingers crossed for another lady and when the cry of 'It's a girl' came, they were all overjoyed. Lynne said: 'When Katie was pregnant they couldn't tell what gender the baby was because of how it was lying in the womb. 'Of course we just wanted the baby to be healthy - but we were all secretly hoping for another girl. During Katie's pregnancy, her female relatives kept their fingers crossed for another lady and when the cry of 'It's a girl' came, there really was no surprise .

'We are a very close family, especially the women, and it's lovely to have another girl in the family. 'And to have five generations of living women is just unheard of. 'My mum is the head of the family, for 89 she is brilliant, and she is absolutely thrilled to have her first great-great-grandchild.' Lynne's husband John was the first to realise that the family were an unusual statistic. She added: 'It was my husband John who first pointed out that actually it was quite unusual to have five generations of women in one family. Despite her efforts to keep the sex of her baby quiet, it was no surprise when new mother Katie gave birth to Pixie-Lee on February 28 . 'We weren't sure what the odds were but after speaking to people we realised it was quite rare. 'So when Katie had a little girl we were absolutely delighted. We are all going to get together this weekend to have a big family get together to celebrate Mother's Day.

"By . Arlene Phillips . As a child, my ambition was to be a ballerina. I would stand on tiptoes and twirl around in the mirror imagining myself leaping across the stage at the Royal Ballet to the crowd's rapturous applause. But soon after starting dance classes, it became crushingly obvious that no matter how adroit my pirouette, I would never be Giselle. Where my fellow dancers' legs were long and lithe, mine were short by comparison. I had to give up my dreams of ballet stardom and went into contemporary dance instead. It was an early lesson in having to make the best of what I had. Even now at 70, despite being under 5ft 3in, I always try to make the most of my legs because I've been so painfully aware of their, well, shortcomings. Autograph dress, £69, marksandspencer.com; Nude patent heels, £185, lucychoilondon.com (right) It doesn't help that I have gained weight over the past two years. I used to be very strict with my diet, cutting out carbohydrates, but recently I've relaxed a bit and started eating the things I love - cheese, chocolate and pasta. I've gone up from a size eight to a size 12, which is quite a lot for my height, and it means I have to dress even more cleverly, because some outfits - like the one pictured I wore last September - can make me look dumpy. If you've ever seen me judging, you'll know I never give very high marks. But I do think some of these outfits, selected by the Mail's fashion editor Eliza Scarborough, work wonders. ARLENE SAYS: The Duchess of Cambridge has fabulous legs, but there's a reason she often wears nude heels. Paired with matching tights, they can make your legs look up to six inches longer because you trick the eye into seeing the shoe as part of the leg. Meanwhile the dark side panels on this dress have the effect of whittling down the waist. 9/10 . Eliza says: It's not just the shoe's colour that matters - the style can also affect how long your legs look. Avoid ankle-strap or T-bar shoes, which will cut your leg off at the ankle and cost you inches.

SAYS: This reminds me of the ballet dress I wore to teach in, and I'd . forgotten what a flattering look it is. It has a lovely, flirty swing . and makes my legs look like they start from my waist. And with this . neckline, I'm well aware my best asset is my bosom rather than my legs! 6/10 . Eliza says: The wide flare is an optical illusion, making . the legs look longer, and the floaty edge doesn't cut your legs off . halfway up, as a pencil skirt would. ARLENE . SAYS: Instead of accentuating my natural waistline, this dress gives me . a waist just under my bust, which has the effect of making my top half . shorter and my bottom half longer. Usually, I avoid horizontal stripes . in case they give me extra width. But the dark panels at the side mean . the overall effect here is slimming. However, the stripes don't make me . feel totally confident.        6/10 . Eliza says: If you're short, . avoid clothes that accentuate your natural waist. The higher your . waistline, the longer the legs appear.

This is my favourite. The soft, stretchy, clingy crepe fits perfectly to the body but gives a long, smooth line. Because you can't see my knees, it gives the illusion mine could be higher than they are! And the skirt shows off every inch of lower leg. Perfect. 10/10 . Eliza says: Covering your knees gives the impression your legs go up higher than they do. But don't let hems fall too low - a mid-calf skirt can look grannyish if you're lacking in height. ARLENE SAYS: To lengthen the leg, match your shoe colour to your trousers. Then the eye travels from the top of your leg to the floor. This gives the impression that my waistline is higher than it is. And if these trousers had been in black or white, I'd have been in heaven, but I'm not crazy about the bright blue.        5/10 . ELIZA SAYS: As well as colour-matching trousers and shoes, choose a slim, tapered-leg trouser. Trousers that are wide at the bottom, like a boot-cut or flare, will make your legs look shorter - no matter how high your heels.","In ballet Arlene, 70, realised her legs were short in comparison to others'

The two looked understandably delighted to be reunited, as Eugenie continues her position with New York based auction house, Paddle8, which keeps the two on opposite sides of the Atlantic.

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple is considering launching its first Android app in a bid to sell music to users of Google's software, it has been claimed. The firm is also considering launching a streaming service to take on Spotify. Experts say the moves could help stem the tide of falling sales for the firm's iTunes store as streaming services become popular. The move would be the first time ever apple has created an app for Android. 'Apple has opened exploratory talks with senior label executives about the possibility of launching an on-demand streaming service that would rival Spotify and Beats Music, according to three people familiar with the talks,' according to Billboard Biz. 'Apple is also thinking about adding an iTunes App for Android phones, the Google rival that has been growing faster than the iPhone,' the same sources said. Apple already has 80 percent of download sales in the U.S. However, overall, song downloads began to slump last year, and are now down about 12 percent through the first eight weeks of 2014, according to Nielsen SoundScan data. The decline is attributed to several factors, including streaming music services like Spotify and recently launched Beats Music. Steve Jobs launching iTunes Music Store in the territories of Great Britain, Germany and France, on June 15, 2004 in London. In a major shift in strategy, the firm is now claimed to be considering launching an Android app for the store, even though co-founder which Steve Jobs famously claimed he would go 'thermonuclear war' on Android , believing Google simply copied the iPhone . According to the LA Times, music industry insiders said Apple is pushing for a new release window — similar to the one that some Hollywood studios impose for films newly released for home viewing. 'These are really changing times, and I think everybody's going to be trying different things, whether it's iTunes, Spotify or the labels,' Irving Azoff, manager of the Eagles, Christina Aguilera and other acts, told the paper. Apple has a history of digital exlusives. In 2010 it struck a deal with the record label EMI and the Beatles' company Apple Corps to sell digital downloads of the legendary rock band's music on iTunes. 'It's kind of up for grabs.' According Nielson, 48% of smartphone owners use their portable devices every day to listen to streaming music, as opposed to 42% who use them for downloading music. Another rap act relied heavily on streaming to build awareness for a forthcoming release — and debuted at the top of Billboard's album chart last week. Streaming services such as Spotify are believed to have eaten into Apple's sales . Schoolboy Q's 'Oxymoron,' was heavily promoted on Spotify, and sold nearly 139,000 copies in its first week, after . Spotify users in the U.S. had listened to 3.3 million streams in the months ahead of the album debut .

"By . Bianca London . A mother-of-seven has lost 16 stone after she became wedged in a shower cubicle during a family caravan holiday. At her heaviest Louise Watson, 33, weighed 27st and was warned by doctors that unless she stopped her nightly kebab takeaway habit her internal organs would be crushed under her own weight. Once forced to wear size 30 clothing, she can now fit into size 12 outfits following an NHS-funded gastric bypass operation. Louise Watson, 33, weighed 27st and was warned by doctors that unless she stopped her nightly kebab takeaway habit her internal organs would be crushed under her own weight. She lost 16st and is now 10st 10lb . Speaking about her motivation for losing weight, she said: 'The caravan holiday was the last straw. I'd been fine getting into the shower, but as I got out I became stuck. I couldn't move at all because of my size. 'I had to call to my husband Jamie to come and get me. It was mortifying. Later on the beach someone called out that I was a beached whale. I knew I had to do something about it.' Mrs Watson, of Northampton, saw her weight steadily increase following the births of her children Michael, now 16, Evie, nine, Annabel, eight, twins Olivia and Eston, six, Ronnie, four, and Francesca, two. The holiday photo which persuaded Louise, pictured at 27st, to lose weight - she was shamed into losing weight after she became stuck in a shower cubicle . The mother-of-seven piled on the pounds after giving birth to each of her children. She would have takeaways, such as kebabs, for dinner most nights . She said: 'With every pregnancy I put on weight, then I made a concerted effort to lose it, only to regain it and add an extra stone every time. 'Over time my weight just went up and up. I tried every diet imaginable - different branded programmes, focussing on particular types of food, using slimming milkshakes and tablets â€“ but nothing worked. 'After the children went to bed I would binge eat. I would order the biggest thing on the menu from a takeaway, followed by ice cream for dessert. 'I made sure the children ate properly but I wasn't anywhere near as careful when it came to myself. I was constantly giving myself excuses to overeat. If I reached a weight target in a week of fad dieting, I would reward myself with a fatty takeaway. 'It was a very vicious cycle and I became severely depressed. I barely left the house.' Louise, pictured in Skegness, had gone on an English holiday because she couldn't face getting on a plane and having the embarrassment of getting stuck in a plane seat - but had a similar incident in the shower cubicle . Louise was particularly hurt after someone on the beach branded her a 'beached whale' while on a family holiday . Her pregnancy with Francesca was particularly harrowing. She had to spend weeks in hospital attached to special equipment. She said: 'The midwives had to order a special bed and mattress which passed health and safety standards for people my weight. 'I had to be induced into labour so they knew the equipment was ready. It was so embarrassing. I couldn't look the other expectant mothers in the eye. I felt guilty about getting such special treatment.' A holiday to Skegness in September 2012, when she was around 27st, proved all too much. She said: 'I had gone on an English holiday because I couldn't face getting on a plane and having the embarrassment of getting stuck in a plane seat. I ended up with the embarrassment of getting stuck in a shower cubicle instead. Louise, pictured, left, at her wedding day in May 2009, had to do a double-take at holiday photos of herself and was immediately inspired to lose weight after that . 'I was aware of people looking at me. Someone on the beach someone shouted out I was a beached whale. I felt so sorry for my kids who had to deal with that. 'At several points my eldest son got hold of the camera. When I was bigger everyone knew not to take pictures of me because I hated my size. When I got home and saw the pictures he had taken I had to do a double-take. 'I didn't register that the person in the pictures was me - I looked so large and unhealthy.' In February 2013 Mrs Watson had a gastric bypass at Luton and Dunstable Hospital. She said: 'I was challenged to lose five per cent of my body weight before I even got to the operating table to help my body prepare for the change. I was on a milk diet for four weeks. Despite her substantial weight loss, Louise has been left with excess skin. She will need to wait another year before becoming eligible for corrective surgery . 'It was horrible. I was incredibly sick, but in a month I lost around three stone. After the operation I was on liquids for a month before building up to more solid food.' At her heaviest weight, Mrs Watson typically ate six custard cream biscuits with coffee followed by a fry-up for breakfast. She would snack on chocolate and crisps consistently throughout the day, often buying a McDonald's lunch. While her children would receive healthy square meals in the evening, her default option was nearly always a kebab or Chinese takeaway. Today she restricts herself to black coffee with half a slice of toast for breakfast, followed by yogurt with cheese and crackers for lunch and a dinner of fish or chicken with fresh vegetables. Snacks consist of handfuls of cashew or pistachio nuts, or fresh fruit. Louise now weighs 10st 10lb, to the delight of her supportive husband Jamie (right) Mrs Watson, an office administration assistant, now weighs 10st 10lb, to the delight of her supportive husband Jamie, 35. She said: 'My family are so proud of me. My eldest son is a bit embarrassed - I think he's worried that people will mistake me for his girlfriend while we're out and about. 'I've changed my look completely. I used to wear frumpy clothes but now I have a vintage retro look. I can walk past relatives and they don't recognise me. I have a real love of fashion now.' Mrs Watson's amazing weight loss has left her with excess skin but she will have to wait another year before surgeons consider her suitable for corrective cosmetic surgery. She said: 'I have to wear binding underwear and three bras to have any shape to my body. I make sure I wear long-sleeve tops to disguise the excess skin on my arms. Other than that, it's just about bearable. 'It's changed my life around completely. I was very depressed and unsure of myself before I lost the weight. I'd only leave the house once a week to do the weekly food shop and even then I would get panic attacks because I was so anxious. 'Those days are behind me now. The surgery lifted that dark cloud from me. I feel as though I've been reborn.' Six custard cream biscuits with coffee and fry-up for breakfast . Chocolate and crisps consistently throughout day .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Stress is bad for our health, but it could also be undermining our relationships with other people, a new study has claimed. Stressed men tend to become more selfish and less able to understand their own emotions, as well as those of other people, which can mean they behave meanly, according to a team of international scientists. However, they discovered that the opposite is true for women, who become more ‘prosocial,’ perhaps because they are more able to share their problems and successfully harness external help. Stressed men (illustrated) tend to become more selfish and less able to understand their own emotions, as well as those of other people, which can mean they behave meanly according to a team of international scientists . The study found that men tend to become more self-centred and less able to understand other people's emotions. However, women become more 'prosocial' under pressure. They are not exactly sure why women can cope better when stressed. Dr Giorgia Silani thinks it could be because at a psychological level, women be able to internalise stress and then interact effectively with others to get support. 'This means the more they need help - and are thus stressed - the more they apply social strategies,' she said. The gender difference might be explained by the oxytocin system. The hormone connects social behaviours and a previous study has revealed that women have higher physiological levels of oxytocin than men when they are stressed. While women seem to apply social . straggles to cope with stressful scenarios, the study hints that men . find it harder to communicate and ask for help. ‘There's a subtle boundary between the ability to identify with others and take on their perspective - and therefore be empathic - and the inability to distinguish between self and other, thus acting egocentrically,’ said of Giorgia Silani from the International School for Advanced Studies of Trieste in Italy. ‘To be truly empathic and behave prosocially it's important to maintain the ability to distinguish between self and other and stress appears to play an important role in this,’ she said. Stress is a psycho-biological mechanism that enables a person to recruit extra resources when they are faced with a demanding situation. This lets us cope with a stressful scenario by either trying to reduce the internal ‘extra’ resources or by seeking external support, she said. The researchers, who were also from the Social Cognitive Neuroscience Unit of the University of Vienna and the University of Freiburg, began their study with a starting hypothesis that stressed individuals tend to be more egocentric. The researchers are not sure why women cope better with stress but said that at a psychosocial level, females may have internalised the stressful experience so that they receive more external support by sharing their problems and interacting better with others (pictured) They said that taking a selfish perspective reduces the emotional and cognitive load and that they expected people to be less empathetic in the study, which was published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology. However, they were surprised to find that only men become more self-centred under stress. They created ‘conditions of moderate stress’ in a laboratory by forcing participants to take mental arithmetic tests and to make a speech. The participants - half of whom were female and the other half male - then had to imitate certain movements to demonstrate motor control, recognise their own or other people’s emotions or make a judgement taking on another person's perspective to display cognitive condition. ‘What we observed was that stress worsens the performance of men in all three types of tasks. The opposite is true for women’ Dr Silani said. The researchers were surprised to find that only men become more self-centred under stress. They created 'conditions of moderate stress' in a laboratory by forcing participants to take mental arithmetic tests (illustrated) and make a speech to come to their conclusion . The researchers are not sure why this happens but said they might try and find possible explanations in subsequent studies. ‘At a psychosocial level, women may have internalised the experience that they receive more external support when they are able to interact better with others,’ Dr Silani said. ‘This means that the more they need help - and are thus stressed - the more they apply social strategies’ Dr Silani said that at a physiological level, the gender difference might be accounted for by the oxytocin system. ‘Oxytocin is a hormone connected with social behaviours and a previous study found that in conditions of stress women had higher physiological levels of oxytocin than men,’ she added. The old saying 'a problem shared is a problem halved' may have been based on scientific fact, according to a study published in January. Researchers from California have proved that the best way to beat stress is to share your feelings - and sharing with someone in the same situation yields the best results. This is because sharing a threatening situation with a person in a similar emotional state 'buffers individuals from experiencing the heightened levels of stress that typically accompany threat,' claimed the study. A total of 52 female undergraduates were paired up and asked to make a speech while being taped by researchers from the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business. Prior to each speech, participants were encouraged to discuss how they felt about public speaking with the researchers, and their fellow participants. Other participants were told not to discuss their feelings. Levels of the stress hormone cortisol were measured before, during and after each participant's speech. The researchers found that stress levels were significantly reduced when the participants were able to vocalise how they felt about the speeches. This was most noticeable when the discussion was had with a fellow participant, in which they shared a common fear.","Researchers from the International School for Advanced Studies of Trieste, Italy, found men find it hard to understand people's emotions under stress .

"By . Luke Garratt . Plain cigarette packaging has no branding or advertising on the box, instead coming only with a plain description of the product and a large warning label . Unbranded cigarettes may not stop people from smoking according to new research in Australia where cigarette packets are already unbranded. Industry data from Australia has warned plain packaging could lead to a rise in the sale of cigarette packs, because smokers, and potential smokers, will no longer care about buying expensive brands. The industry data suggests the amount of tobacco delivered to retailers has actually risen since the move to plain packaging was introduced in 2012. Health campaigners have been vying for the plain packages all over the world, saying the move will protect children and potential new smokers who are attracted to branded packaging. The thinking is that potential smokers are less likely to buy packs of cigarettes if they are unbranded. The data comes as leaders of the industry have announced that they intend to present an independent report to ministers, calling for a review of the banning of branded cigarette packs. Philip Morris International, the manufacturers of Marlboro cigarettes, released data from Australia, which introduced the ban on plain packaging on December 1, 2012, which suggests that they have had a rise in deliveries of tobacco for the first time in five years. Their data suggests that unbranded cigarette packets have reversed the downward trend of the fall in people buying cigarettes, and that people may potentially be buying more. It says that in 2013 after a year of unbranded packaging, tobacco firms in Australia sold the equivalent of 21.074 cigarettes - a rise of 0.3 per cent after four years of bad sales, while the sales of loose tobacco used in roll-up cigarettes increased 3.4 per cent. Health campaigners and anti-smoking groups previously said they were concerned about this potential result from instituting unbranded packaging. However, they also say a ban on branded packaging is not enough, and that harsher taxes to increase the price of cigarettes should also be instituted to dissuade people even more. The proposal for plain packs in the UK . was intended to reduce the amount of children and teenagers that would . ordinarily be drawn to smoking because of branded packaging, which can . make a cigarette packet seem more attractive. Parliament has been toying with the possibility of a UK ban, and in November 2013 they ordered an independent review of branded packaging to find out whether the ban would be effective. However, so far the issue is still under consideration, and no date has been given as to when a ban might be introduced in the UK. Currently branded packaging in the UK is still allowed, and the Government has not set a date for the potential ban of branded packaging. However, . parliament has been reviewing the issue, and have requested an . independent review into whether banning branded packaging would be . successful. The key facts on tobacco sales in the UK are: . The . Labour Party banned all advertising of tobacco products as a part of . the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act in 2002, which banned tobacco . advertising in the following order: . The new data from the tobacco industry suggests that the plain packaging in Australia has actually increased sales of cigarettes and loose tobacco, the reverse effect from the agenda of plain packaging . The UK wanted to wait for the results of the Australian ban on branded packaging in 2012 before making a decision. Deborah Arnott, director of Action on Smoking and Health believes that the data is a deliberate attempt to promote the agenda of the cigarette and tobacco companies. She said: 'We are repeatedly seeing attempts to undermine the case for standardised packaging. 'It is about dissuading them from taking up smoking - and one year's data from Australia about delivery levels of tobacco tells us nothing about that. Eoin Dadis, director of corporate affairs for Philip Morris in Britain believes that the implications that the data from his company bring to light need to be examined. He said: 'If people are buying cheaper stuff, maybe they're smoking more of it. 'It's definitely a point of interest and that's something that absolutely needs to be explored because that's the counter of what this policy is seeking to achieve.' Electronic cigarettes are classed as 'medicines' since tightened of nicotine-containing products . A new report from the university of California in San Francisco suggests that while e-cigarettes are promoted as aids to help people stop smoking, they are not stopping people smoking. The study was conducted with data from 949 smokers (88 of the smokers using e-cigarettes at baseline) to determine if e-cigarettes were associated with more successful quitting or reduced cigarette consumption. But the results were that more women, younger adults and people with less education used e-cigarettes, and that e-cigarette use among their test subjects did not reduce cigarette consumption or help people quit. Rachel Grana Ph.D, the author of the study, said: 'Nonetheless, our data add to the . current evidence that e-cigarettes may not increase rates of smoking . cessation. 'Regulations should prohibit advertising claiming or . suggesting that e-cigarettes are effective smoking cessation devices . until claims are supported by scientific evidence.'","Data from tobacco industry says plain packaging may increase smoking .

"By . Leon Watson . Besotted: Sadie Johnson, 36, systematically plundered £45,600 from a charity he helped run, a court heard . A lovesick secretary who stole more than £45,000 from a charity to splash on a man she met online broke down and wept as she was jailed for 12 months. Sadie Johnson, 36, was a personal assistant to orthopaedic consultant Peter Hallam at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. But the besotted crook systematically plundered £45,600 from a charity he helped run, a court heard. Mr Hallam was also secretary of the East Anglian Orthopaedic Club, which is not connected with the NNUH but helps promote training and courses for doctors. Johnson began siphoning off cash from it over a four-year period, Norwich Crown Court was told. She was caught after she went off long-term sick and Mr Hallam got her replacement to check the account in January this year over an unpaid invoice. The shocked expert found there was only £124 left and the charity was 'almost bust'. Chris Youell, prosecuting, said: 'He was somewhat surprised and shocked as he expected it to have substantially more.' Mr Youell said Johnson had written out cheques to herself and forged Mr Hallam's signature. He said there were 93 transactions amounting to £45,600. Mr Youell said the PA admitted her crimes. Johnson, who cried in the dock, accepted she had lived beyond her means and spent money on a man she met on the internet. Mr Youell said: 'She said she had no idea how much she had taken.' Johnson, of Bowthorpe, Norwich, admitted theft from her employer and was jailed for 12 months. Judge Anthony Bate told her she had breached the trust placed in her. The judge said: 'People in your kind of job have to be trusted by doctors, patients and colleagues.' Norwich Crown Court was told Johnson began siphoning off cash from it over a four-year period . He said that as a consultant surgeon Mr Hallam was busy looking after his patients. 'They don't have the time to devote to routine paperwork,' added Judge Bate. 'They trust their secretaries and personal assistants.' The judge said she had started stealing after coming under the 'malign influence' of a man she met. Judge Bate said that while it explained her actions, it did not excuse them. 'You brought this whole shame on yourself and you must now pay the penalty for it,' he told her. Stephen Spence, defending, said: 'It was inevitably going to lead back to her. She had been living beyond her means and was spending some of the money on herself.' But he said she was also 'na've' and after meeting a man online was manipulated by him into taking the money and she had been 'milked' of cash. 'She is a rather broken young woman but who has a lot of her life ahead of her,' said Mr Spence.","Sadie Johnson, 36, was a PA to a orthopaedic consultant .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Stanford researchers have developed adapters (pictured) that enable a smartphone to capture images of the front and back of the eye . Plenty of people put off eye tests because of the expense or the time it takes to see a specialist. But these problems could become a thing of the past as researchers have developed cheap adapters that let a smartphone take high-quality pictures of the front and back of the eye. They claim to make it easy for anyone with basic training to take a picture of the eye and pass it to experts who can interpret it and then store it as part of a patient’s electronic records. ‘Think Instagram for the eye,’ said one of the developers, Robert Chang, who is assistant professor of ophthalmology of Stanford University School of Medicine. They believe their technology can increase access to eye-care services as well as to improve doctors’ ability to advise on patient care remotely. Current equipment used to photograph the eye costs tens of thousands of dollars and requires extensive training to use properly. Some rural areas of the world do not have access to it at all. Ophthalmology resident Dr David Myung, who is lead-author of the paper describing the technology, said: ‘Adapting smartphones for the eye has the potential to enhance the delivery of eye care - in particular, to provide it in places where it’s less accessible. ‘Whether it’s in the emergency department, where patients often have to wait a long time for a specialist, or during a primary-care physician visit, we hope that we can improve the quality of care for our patients, especially in the developing world where ophthalmologists are few and far between. ‘Imagine a car accident victim arriving in the emergency department with an eye injury resulting in a hyphema - blood inside the front of her eye. Normally the physician would have to describe this finding in her electronic record with words alone. The researchers believe the technology is a step towards remote diagnosis of conditions. While microscope adapters for smartphones that can take images of the front of the eye are available, they are time consuming. A view of the retina showing diabetic retinopathy associated with diabetes mellitus is pictured . It's a cheap adapter that lets a smartphone take high-quality pictures of the front and back of the eye. The gadget claims to make it easy for anyone with basic training to take a picture of the eye and pass it to experts who can interpret it. It could increase access to eye-care services as well as to improve doctors’ ability to advise on patient care remotely. The device offers point-and-shoot ability in seconds, not minutes, with instant upload to a secure server to store patient records. First prototypes were built using inexpensive parts including plastic caps and spacers, LEDs, switches, universal mounts, macro lenses and even a handful of Lego bricks. A computerised model of the prototypes was used to produce 3D-printed versions, now dubbed Eye-Go. A clinical study of the quality of the smartphone images will be conducted in the Stanford Emergency Department, while a second study will test the ability of images taken with the adapters to track eye disease in patients with diabetes. ‘Smartphones today not only have the camera resolution to supplement those words with a high-resolution photo, but also the data-transfer capability to upload that photo securely to the medical record in a matter of seconds,’ he explained. Dr Myung believes the technology is a step towards remote diagnosis of conditions. While microscope adapters for smartphones that can take images of the front of the eye are available, they are time consuming and inconvenient, he explained. ‘Given the fast pace of patient care, he wanted point-and-shoot ability in seconds, not minutes, with instant upload to a secure server,’ Dr Myung said. So they started designing a pocket-sized adapter that makes the phone do most of the ‘heavy lifting’ and after several prototypes, found a combination of magnification and lighting elements that worked. ‘It took some time to figure out how to mount the lens and lighting elements to the phone in an efficient yet effective way,’ said Dr Myung, who built the prototypes with inexpensive parts including plastic caps and spacers, LEDs, switches, universal mounts, macro lenses and even a handful of Lego bricks. The scientists believe their technology can increase access to eye-care (illustrated) services as well as to improve doctors' ability to advise on patient care remotely . After successfully imaging the front of the eye, he focused on visualising the inside lining of the back of the eye, called the retina. ‘Taking a photo of the retina is harder because you need to focus light through the pupil to reach inside the eye,’ Dr Myung said. He worked out the perfect distance and lighting conditions for a simple adapter that connects a conventional examination lens to a phone to do this. A computerised model of the prototypes was used to produce 3D-printed versions, according to the study, which was published in the Journal of Mobile Technology in Medicine. A clinical study of the quality of the smartphone images will be conducted in the Stanford Emergency Department, while a second study will test the ability of images taken with the adapters to track eye disease in patients with diabetes. A small batch of adapters, currently dubbed EyeGo will be produced for distribution and will be available for purchase for research purposes only.","Researchers from Stanford University, California, believe their adapters make it easy for anyone with basic training to take a picture of the eye .

"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . and Matt Chorley . Revealed: This is the prototype of the badge which senior Tories are planning to wear in the Commons next week . This is the badge which senior Conservatives are planning to wear in an . extraordinary show of defiance against Commons Speaker John Bercow . following a series of intemperate outbursts against the party’s MPs. A group including several ministers . has formed what has been called ‘the BBB Club’, members of which . complain they have been ‘Bol****ed By Bercow’. Transport minister Simon Burns has designed a prototype badge featuring three bees - a reference to the BBB club name - which Tory MPs and ministers plan to wear to the last Prime Minister’s . Questions before Parliament’s summer recess next week. The design of the badge also appears calculated to poke fun at the Speaker’s extreme phobia of wasps and bees, which is said to date back to his childhood. According to a biography of Mr Bercow, he was mocked at school for his terror of flying insects and was once thrown into a biology pond. Those understood to have been . approached about joining the revolt include ministers Michael Gove, . and Anna Soubry, former minister Tim Loughton and . backbenchers Jason McCartney, Simon Kirby and Ian Liddell-Grainger. Conservative MP Sheryll Murray, who . has produced badges calling for an EU referendum and the No to AV . campaign, has been asked to make the ‘BBB’ badges in time for next week, . one of the rebel MPs told the Daily Mail. Such a move would be an unprecedented . snub to the Speaker, whose often fractious relations with Tory MPs have . been stretched to breaking point by spectacular outbursts in recent . weeks. Tory anger over his alleged bias . against the party was intensified yesterday as he cut David Cameron off . as he attacked Labour over its donations from the trade unions, waving . his hand dismissively until the Prime Minister’s microphone was cut off . while he was still speaking. MPs claim the Speaker’s behaviour from . the chair has been increasingly ‘eccentric’ in recent weeks, with . Tories bearing the brunt. His outbursts have even led to speculation in . Westminster that his marriage to wife Sally may be under strain. A series of eruptions began when he . launched an extraordinary attack on Mr Liddell-Grainger, the . mild-mannered Bridgwater and West Somerset MP, who he accused of . heckling at a Labour MP. Mr Bercow yelled: ‘Be quiet, and if . you cannot be quiet, get out. You are adding nothing, and you are . subtracting a lot. It is rude, it is stupid, it is pompous and it needs . to stop.’ But to the Speaker’s embarrassment, . Tory Minister Alan Duncan admitted that he was the heckler, with Mr . Liddell-Grainger the innocent party. Health minister Miss Soubry was . attacked three times by the Speaker, who declared that she ‘thinks her . views are relevant, but we are not interested’. Suspicion: Backbench MPs are planning to wear badges bearing the title BBB - inferring they have been 'bol****ed by Bercow' Later in the week, he issued an . extraordinary rebuke of respected Defence Secretary Philip Hammond over . his handling of a Commons statement on the Territorial Army, accusing . him of being ‘utterly incompetent’ and ‘woefully inadequate’ and giving a . strong suggestion that he considered him a bore. The same day, he attacked transport . minister Mr Burns, who turned on Labour MPs who were heckling him. A . furious Mr Bercow accused Mr Burns of hypocrisy and said he was a ‘slow . learner’ who had to ‘raise his game’. The minister was heard muttering . that the Speaker was a ‘silly little man’. The previous week, Tory MPs claim the . Speaker failed to discipline a Labour MP who allegedly made an offensive . gesture to Chancellor George Osborne during his statement on the . spending review. Witnesses say Tory backbencher Jason . McCartney wrote the name of the offending Labour MP on a note and handed . it to the Speaker only to see Mr Bercow tear it up in fury. Yesterday, at Prime Minister’s . Questions, the Speaker again turned his ire on the Conservative benches, . though Labour MPs were making far more noise at one of the rowdiest . recent sessions. He told MP Michael Ellis, a former . lawyer: ‘You find it so difficult to control yourself. I am sure you did . not when you were practising at the Bar. Calm it, man! Get a grip of . the situation!’ Conservatives are planning a show of defiance against the perceived bias of Commons Speaker John Bercow, pictured with his wife Sally . Tory MPs have privately commissioned . research from the Commons library which suggests that Mr Bercow is far . quicker to rebuke his old Conservative colleagues than their Labour . counterparts. The study showed that over a six-month . period the Speaker reprimanded 15 Tory MPs for heckling or interrupting . during debates, and only two Labour MPs. He rebuked 16 Conservative MPs for . other examples of alleged misconduct, compared to two Labour MPs, one . Liberal Democrat and one Scottish Nationalist. Mr Bercow has long been viewed . suspiciously by Tory MPs. They suspect the Buckingham MP, once a . hardline Right-winger, began an extraordinary move across the political . spectrum after realising he would only get the job of Speaker with . Labour support. He won only a handful of Tory votes in . a House of Commons secret ballot, securing the job thanks to massive . support on the Labour benches. The exact number is hotly disputed, but . is thought to be barely into double figures. If an MP objects to Mr Bercow’s . re-election as Speaker after the next election in 2015, an open ballot . will have to be held of the entire Commons.","Backbench MPs planning extraordinary show of defiance in last PMQs .

"It is the moment a lifetime of scientific research is proved to be true - and could lead to a Nobel prize. Researchers at Stanford today posted a video in which they revealed just how a leading physicist reacted when he was told his theory had been proved correct on a groundbreaking experiment that has changed the face of physics. It shows Assistant Professor Chao Lin Kuo visiting the home of Professor Andre Lindei, known as the 'father of inflation'. Scroll down to see the video . Eureka! Assistant Professor Chao-Lin Kuo surprises Professor Andrei Linde with evidence that supports cosmic inflation theory. Once the surprise has sunk in, the pair celebrate the 'spectacular' discovery with champagne. Scientists view the the universe as being made up of a 'fabric of space-time'. This corresponds to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity which was published 1916. Objects in the . universe bend this fabric, and more massive objects bend it more. Gravitational waves are considered ripples in this fabric. They can be produced for instance, when black holes orbit each other or by the merging of galaxies. Gravitational waves are also thought to have been produced during the Big Bang. 'I'm going to tell him our experiment has found the smoking gun evidence of inflation,' says Chao Lin Kuo, one of the team that today announced the discovery. 'I have a surprise for you,' he tells the Professor, known as the 'father of inflation' for his work on the subject, before explaining the team has proved his theory. 'What? Can you repeat it again?,' the stunned scientists tells him. The discovery reveals what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang. This is a very brief moment of time at the beginning of everything when the universe expanded very rapidly - a theory called cosmic inflation first devised by Linde. According to Albert Einstein when something very explosive like this happens it leaves ripples in space-time known as 'gravitational waves'. Gravitational waves from inflation generate a faint but distinctive twisting pattern in the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background, which is the afterglow of the afterglow of the Big Bang . Scientists, from left, Clem Pryke, Jamie Bock, Chao-Lin Kuo and John Kovac smile during a news conference at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge to announce their groundbreaking results . The theory suggests that this intial spurt would have taken the infant universe from something infinitely small to something close to the size of a marble. 'It's just unbelievable quite honestly,' Professor Peter Ade, who helped build the instrument that detected the waves, told MailOnline. 'This is confirming what is, to me, a wacky idea. The next step is quite clear; to confirm the data with another technology.' This graphic shows the universe as it evolved from the Big Bang to now. Nasa scientists believe that the universe expanded from subatomic scales to the astronomical in just a fraction of a second after its birth . The finding by the BICEP2 telescope (pictured) in the South Pole could rank with the greatest discoveries about the universe over the last 25 years . Researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for . Astrophysics in Massachusetts built super-sensitive radiation detectors . and installed them in the BICEP2 radio telescope at the South Pole to . find these 'ripples in the sand.' Nine years later they found these . swirling patterns in cosmic background radiation created by the . gravitational waves caused by the very beginnings of the universe. Many scientists already believed that an initial, extremely rapid growth spurt happened, but finding this evidence has been a key goal in the study of the universe. The results have been described as 'spectacular', and are expected to result in a Nobel prize for the scientists . The discovery gives us a window on the universe at the very beginning when it was far less than one-trillionth of a second old. The work still has to be reviewed by other scientists, but there is already talk of a Nobel prize. 'It's what's I would term Nobel prize winning physics,' continued Professor Ade. 'Just who that prize goes to, however, will be up for debate.' Microwave radiation from the whole sky, captured by the European Space Agency's Planck satellite. Astronomers today announced that they have found 'primordial gravitational waves' - an echo of the Big Bang in which the universe came into existence 14bn years ago. According to Albert Einstein when something very explosive like this happens it leaves ripples in space-time known as 'gravitational waves' A telescope at the south pole, called BICEP2 (Background Imaging of cosmic Extragalactic Polarisation) was used to search for evidence of gravitational waves. The instrument, which scans the sky from the South Pole, examines what is called the cosmic microwave background, the extremely weak radiation that pervades the universe. The background radiation is not precisely uniform. Like light, the relic radiation is polarised as the result of interacting with electrons and atoms in space. Computer models predicted a particular curl pattern in the background radiation that would match what would be expected with the universe's inflation after the big bang. It did this by detecting a subtle property of the cosmic microwave background radiation. This is radiation that was created in the Big Bang and originally discovered in 1964. BICEP2 measured the large-scale polarisation of this microwave radiation. Only primordial gravitational waves can imprint such a pattern, and only if they have been amplified by inflation. ‘It's just amazing,’ added theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss of Arizona State University, who was not involved in the work. ‘You can see back to the beginning of time.’ Another outside expert, physicist Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the finding already suggests that some ideas about the rapid expansion of the universe can be ruled out. Right after the Big Bang, the universe was a hot soup of particles. It took about 380,000 years to cool enough that the particles could form atoms, then stars and galaxies. Billions of years later, planets formed from gas and dust that were orbiting stars. The universe has continued to spread out. Professor Krauss said he thinks the new finding could rank with the greatest discoveries about the universe over the last 25 years, such as the Nobel prize-winning discovery that the universe's expansion is accelerating. The new results were announced by a collaboration that includes researchers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, the University of Minnesota, Stanford University, the California Institute of Technology and Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The team plans to submit its results to a scientific journal this week, said its leader, John Kovac of Harvard. This image shows temperature fluctuations, indicated by variations in colour, of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).  Researchers say since the CMB is a form of light, it exhibits all the properties of light, including polarisation (shown by black lines). The changes in polarisation are thought to be caused by gravitational waves . The 14-billion-year-long history of our universe. It shows the main events that occurred between the initial phase of the cosmos -- where its properties were almost uniform and punctuated only by tiny fluctuations - to the cosmic structure that we see today, ranging from stars and planets to galaxies and galaxy clusters . A telescope at the south pole, called BICEP2 (Background Imaging of cosmic Extragalactic Polarisation) was used to search for evidence of gravitational waves. BICEP2 is shown here in the foreground with the South Pole Telescope in the background . For their research, astronomers scanned about two per cent of the sky for three years with a telescope at the South Pole, chosen for its very dry air, to aid in the observations. They were looking for a specific pattern in light waves within the faint microwave glow left over from the Big Bang. The pattern has long been considered evidence of the rapid growth spurt, known as inflation. Professor Kovac called it ‘the smoking gun signature of inflation.’ The scientists said the light-wave pattern was caused by gravitational waves, which are ripples in the interweaving of space and time that sprawls through the universe. The BICEP2 telescope's focal plane uses novel technology, developed at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, to build an array of devices that use superconductivity to gather, filter, detect, and amplify polarised radiation from the cosmic microwave background.  Each pixel is made from a printed antenna sensitive to polarised millimeter-wave radiation . A full-sky map of the oldest light in the universe. Colors indicate 'warmer' (red) and 'cooler' (blue) spots. Nasa has called this image the best  baby picture  of the Universe ever taken . If confirmed, the new work would be the first detection of such waves from the birth of the universe, which have been called the first tremors of the Big Bang. Arizona State's Krauss cautioned that it's possible that the light-wave pattern is not a sign of inflation, although he stressed it's 'extremely likely’ that it is. It's ‘our best hope’ for a direct test of whether the rapid growth spurt happened, he added. Professor Krauss and other experts said the results must be verified by other observations - a standard caveat in science. Marc Kamionkowski, a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins University who didn't participate in the work, called the detection of the light-wave pattern ‘huge news’ for the study of the cosmos. ‘It's not every day you wake up and learn something completely new about the early universe,’ he said.","Using the BICEP2 telescope, scientists looked at specific patterns in light waves within the faint microwave glow left from the Big Bang .

"By . Simon Walters . and Brendan Carlin . David Cameron faced a new Tory revolt last night after a second Conservative MP admitted he has secretly asked for a vote aimed at sacking him as leader. Anti-gay marriage MP Andrew Bridgen confirmed to The Mail on Sunday that he has written to party chiefs calling for a vote of 'no confidence' in Mr Cameron. It is believed that as many as 25 of the 46 Tory MPs needed to trigger a vote on the Prime Minister's future have now sent letters to senior backbencher Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory 1922 Committee. Revolt: Andrew Bridgen has launched a bid to oust Prime Minister David Cameron . Businessman Mr Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire, said the Tories could lose the next Election unless Mr Cameron was replaced. 'There is a credibility problem with the current leader,' he said. 'It's like being in an aeroplane. The pilot doesn't know how to land it. We can either do something about it . . . or sit back, watch the in-flight movies and wait for the inevitable.' Mr Bridgen, 48, refused to say who he believed should replace Mr Cameron. But he is known to be close to Windsor Tory MP Adam Afriyie, who, as The Mail on Sunday revealed earlier this year, has been linked to a Conservative leadership plot. Ambitious Mr Afriyie denies he is trying to bring down Mr Cameron, but is seen by some Conservatives as a potential future leader. Mr Bridgen enraged Downing Street last week after he wrote a letter signed by 80 Tory MPs challenging Mr Cameron's policy on the civil war in Syria. Amid reports that the Prime Minister is about to supply arms to Syrian rebels, Mr Bridgen and his supporters delivered a letter to No 10 demanding the right for MPs to have the final say on the issue, not Mr Cameron. In trouble? David Cameron could be set to face a 'vote of no confidence' in his leadership from party members . No 10 saw it as an attack on Mr Cameron. 'Bridgen has shown little interest in foreign affairs before. This was a feeble excuse to have a go at the PM,' said a Cameron supporter. The letter was sent to No 10 last week by Mr Bridgen and co-author, fellow Right-wing Eurosceptic MP John Baron, who led the Queen's Speech revolt against the Coalition over a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU. Mr Bridgen's stand against Mr Cameron emerged as a poll commissioned by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft showed that, for the first time, Mr Cameron's ratings are lagging behind those of his party. Mr Bridgen has voiced doubts about Mr Cameron privately for some time, but the gay marriage issue was the last straw. He wrote to Mr Brady calling for a vote of no confidence in Mr Cameron as the legislation was being debated in the Commons last month. Mr Cameron's allies last night dismissed Mr Bridgen's demand for a 'no confidence' vote as 'irrelevant'. One said: 'The vast majority of Conservative MPs are solidly behind the PM. There are always one or two mavericks who are out to cause trouble. The only other MP to write such a letter didn't fare too well.' This comment was a sarcastic reference to Patrick Mercer who, as revealed by this newspaper in 2011, was the first Tory MP to be identified as having called for a vote of no confidence in Mr Cameron. He was forced to resign the Tory whip a week ago after the BBC claimed he had broken the rules on lobbying by MPs. It means his 'no confidence' letter is invalid. Nevertheless, Mr Bridgen's protest letter demanding a vote on Syria produced almost immediate success, with Ministers promising there would be a vote by MPs. By Andrew Bridgen . Vocal: Tory Adam Afriyie has already called on the party to prepare to oust Cameron . I did not seek to make my name public, but since I have been asked to confirm that I have called for a no confidence vote in the Prime Minister, I think it is wrong to deny it. I informed the Tory whips office in advance that I was putting in my letter of no confidence. It is with regret that I have called for such a vote. I have come to the view that although many of our policies are right, whether on welfare reform or reducing the deficit, there is a credibility problem with the current leader. The voters think we have many of the right messages â€“ they just don't believe the messenger. In some cases, the messages are wrong . or badly handled. By pressing ahead with gay marriage and delaying a . promise on an EU referendum until he was forced to do so, Mr Cameron has . fuelled the rise of UKIP. We have created our own nemesis. I . believe the Prime Minister has blundered by forcing through the gay . marriage vote. This was something we did not have to do. The PM marched . us on to the guns over this and it has cost us a lot of support. I . know No 10 denied that anyone close to the Prime Minister regarded . ordinary party members as 'swivel-eyed loons', but I am afraid that some . people at the top of the party do perceive Tory grassroots activists in . this way. There are . questions over the style of leadership we have had in the past few . years. In my view, loyalty has to run in both directions â€“ from the . bottom to the top and the top to the bottom. People will ask whether now . is the wrong time to consider a change of leader. But I think the situation is this: it's like being in an aeroplane. The . pilot doesn't know how to land it. We can either do something about it . before the crash, or sit back, watch the in-flight movies and wait for . the inevitable.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . The Air Force has fired nine mid-level nuclear commanders and will discipline dozens of junior officers at a nuclear missile base in Montana after an exam-cheating scandal that spanned two years. Air Force officials called the moves unprecedented in the history of the intercontinental ballistic missile force. None of the nine commanders fired from Malmstrom Air Force Base were directly involved in the cheating, but each was determined to have failed in his or her leadership responsibilities. Officials originally said the cheating happened in August or September last year. But investigators determined that it in fact spanned from as early as November 2011 until November 2013, according to a defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to reveal details before James' announcement. Out: This undated handout photo provided by the US Air Force shows Col. Robert Stanley II. No Air Force general is being punished, but Stanley, the top commander at the Montana base, which is where the exam cheating was discovered in January, has resigned . It involved unauthorized passing of answers to exams designed to test missile launch officers' proficiency in handling 'emergency war orders,' which are messages involving the targeting and launching of missiles. When the cheating was first revealed, Air Force leaders condemned it as violating the most basic Air Force values. They also suggested that it reflected an unhealthy pressure from commanders to achieve perfect test scores. The tests are one part of a training and evaluation system that is supposed to ensure that every one of the more than 500 missile launch officers is fully proficient. The drastic firings come after the Associated Press last year revealed a series of security and other problems in the nuclear force, including a failed safety and security inspection at Malmstrom Air Force Base. In a bid to correct root causes of the missile corps' failings - including low morale and weak management - the Air Force also announced a series of new or expanded programs to improve leadership development, to modernize the three ICBM bases and to reinforce 'core values' including integrity. Scene: The cheating scandal took place over two years at the Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, pictured . Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James, the service's top civilian official, had promised to hold officers at Malmstrom accountable once the cheating investigation was completed and the scope of the scandal was clear. The most senior person touched directly by the cheating scandal was the commander of Malmstrom's 341st Missile Wing, Col. Robert Stanley. He was permitted to resign, according to a defense official. The official described the Air Force actions on condition of anonymity before they were announced. Nine key commanders below Stanley were fired, including the commanders of the 341st Wing's three missile squadrons, each of which is responsible for 50 Minuteman three nuclear missiles. Also sacked were the commander and deputy commander of the 341st Operations Group, which oversees all three missile squadrons as well as a helicopter unit and a support squadron responsible for administering monthly proficiency tests to Malmstrom's launch crews and evaluating their performance. Members of all three missile squadrons were implicated in the cheating, either by providing or receiving test answers or knowing about the cheating and not reporting it. No generals are being punished. Maj. Gen. Michael Carey, who was fired last October as commander of the 20th Air . Force, which is responsible for all three 150-missile wings of the ICBM . force, is still on duty as a staff officer at Air Force Space Command . but has requested retirement; his request is being reviewed. Widespread: Members of all three missile squadrons were implicated in the cheating at the base, pictured, either by providing or receiving test answers or knowing about the cheating and not reporting it . Carey was fired after a military investigation determined that he had engaged in inappropriate behavior while leading a U.S. government delegation to a nuclear security exercise in Russia last summer. He was replaced by Maj. Gen. Jack Weinstein. The cheating at Malmstrom was discovered in early January during the course of an unrelated drug investigation that included two launch officers at Malmstrom and others at several other bases; the drug probe is continuing. A total of 100 missile launch crew members at Malmstrom were identified as potentially involved in the cheating, but nine were cleared by investigators. Another nine of the 100 are being handled separately by the Air Force Office of Special Investigation; eight of those nine involve possible criminal charges stemming from the alleged mishandling of classified information. Of the remaining 82 officers, an estimated 30 to 40 are eligible to be retrained and returned to duty on the missile force; the rest face unspecified disciplinary action that could include dismissal from the Air Force, officials said. After the cheating was announced in January, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel launched a pair of in-depth reviews of the nuclear forces to determine why the ICBM force has suffered so many setbacks over the past year. Hagel said he his goal was to restore public confidence in the nuclear force.","The commanders were fired from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana Thursday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 16:44 EST, 15 July 2011 . Vitamin D deficiency: Scientists have finally discovered what killed the composer Mozart aged just 35 . If only Mozart had spent a little more time outdoors enjoying the sunshine – because then we might have had a few more masterpieces. Scientists discovered the composer, who died at just 35, did not get enough sunlight. He lived in Austria, which was darker than most of Europe, and would work through the night and sleep during the day. This prevented his body from producing sufficient levels of vitamin D. Mozart suffered illness throughout his life, including kidney disease, smallpox, typhoid fever, tonsillitis and strep throat. Retired Nasa scientist Dr William Grant, believes that vitamin D deficiency was the underlying cause of his  poor health and early death. Dr Grant said: ‘Almost every disease has a vitamin D connection. If only Mozart had known about vitamin D and had access to supplements, he could have doubled his lifetime’s output of work.’ The ‘sunshine vitamin’ is essential for bone health and is produced when the skin is exposed to the ultraviolet B sunrays. Vitamin D deficiency is linked to many medical conditions, and increases the risk of developing influenza, pneumonia, certain cancers, cardiovascular disease and musculoskeletal pain. Another victim: Austrian composer Gustav Mahler died in 1911 from bacterial endocarditis, which is also caused by a lack of vitamin D . 'The same goes for several other famous musicians who died at young ages. 'I think modern-day musicians are unaware of the fact that by staying indoors, they are not getting the adequate amount of vitamin D that they need.' The study 'Medical Problems of Performing Artists' also suggests two other famous musicians died from lack of sunlight. British cellist Jacqueline Mary du Pre died in 1987 aged 42 from multiple sclerosis, a disease linked to vitamin D deficiency. Austrian composer Gustav Mahler died in 1911 from bacterial endocarditis, which is also caused by a lack of vitamin D. Many have speculated over Mozart’s . death. He was buried just three days after he died in 1791, and no . autopsy was ever performed.","Vitamin D deficiency led to early death, claim scientists ."
"By . Ruth Styles . A house that lacks running water and sits on top of a mountain two kilometres from the nearest road wouldn't be many people's idea of a dream place to live but for Steve Lao, 69, it's paradise. The Oxford-educated son of a former state governor, Lao swapped a privileged life in the upper echelons of Indian society and a career as an elite fighter pilot for a hand-to-mouth existence in Uttaranchal in northern India. He lives with wife Parvati in a home that lacks any sort of mod con, including a shower, and sees his children, both of whom moved away, less than once a month. Remote: Former fighter pilot Steve Lao (pictured with Ben Fogle) has chosen to live in the wilderness . But Mr Lao says he has no regrets and instead, says his remote 34-acre estate, Gilling, is the only place he could imagine living. 'Being what I've always been, an . individualist, I'm unsuitable... I can't live in an organised society,' he explains. 'And it's not that I'm evil or bad - I just can't live in that sort of nine to five . environment. And then to have something of your own, to have that . freedom... That's what I like.' Lao and his wife Parvati have lived on the estate for 33 years and had nothing at all when they first arrived. Over years, the couple built themselves a home on the site of what used to be cowsheds and live on just Â£3,000 a year - money they raise through farming and by renting out a pair of small cottages to passing hikers. Mountainous: Steve's home is 6,500ft above sea level and is two kilometres from the nearest road . Basic: The couple's home, which they built themselves, has no running water and cooking is done outside . One such visitor is Ben Fogle, who spends a week with Mr Lao and his family as part of his new series, New Lives in the Wild. 'You can't open the fridge and get out a . bottle of milk,' he observes of Mr Lao's unusual set-up. 'You have to come down here and milk the cow or, in this . case, a buffalo.' Although the house now has electricity, there is no running water, no internet and no central heating -  not pleasant when the temperature dips below zero as it regularly does in winter. Nevertheless, Mr Lao, whose hobbies include spending time alone naked in the wild ('The feeling of wearing no clothes is very liberating to me!') and refurbishing old motorbikes, says that the tough daily slog is well worth it. That slog begins at dawn when the couple get up to milk their seven cows before knuckling down to farm work. Top of the world: Steve and Parvati's home is so remote, getting to the nearest major city takes nine hours . Fun times: When he's not farming, Steve is indulging in his other passion - restoring old motorbikes . Mr Lao also conducts regular patrols around the estate, much of which is forested, in a bid to keep wood-pinching locals from the nearest village at bay. It's a far cry from his early life, spent in luxury with his affluent parents, and his fighter pilot career, which saw him take to the skies in Hawker Hunter and MIG 21 jets and fight in two wars. But in 1974, Lao, who had already been subjected to three court martials for refusing to accept orders, was kicked out of the air force for good - much to the horror of his father. 'My father was horrified because he was a . pretty conservative sort of chap,' he explains, his English still retaining traces of his very British education. 'But I said to him, ""Dad, you took a . lot of bullsh** when you were part of the Defence Ministry but I speak . out which is slightly different from you."" So he was able to keep his . mouth shut - I could not. 'And . then I met this exceptional woman, Parvati,' he continues. 'She's a woman without any . education, this, that and the other but there was something inborn in . her so we fell in love. 'And I told my father and my father said: ""Oh dear, this is not on dammit!"" I said ""Dad, . what's the problem? You should be a better Christian!"" and then I left. 'I . took my guns and put them over my shoulder, I met her father down below . and said ""give us your blessings, we're off!"" and that was it.' But it wasn't long before Lao's father, worried about the fate of the family's Gilling estate, got back in touch. 'Then the shit hit the fan and they said ""Son! Can you come here?"" [to Gilling] and like a good son, I came.' More than 30 years later, Lao is still there and still farming despite having to deal with challenges such as arthritis and the depredations of local leopards. Threat: Steve says that four or five leopards live close to his mountain eyrie as well as parrots and monkeys . Happy: Steve and his wife Parvati have no plans to change their home, despite advancing old age . 'There are around four to five around . here in this area,' he reveals. 'There are many incidences of leopards catching . children, catching women, catching men...' His two children, Richard and Nandoni, were brought up on the estate themselves, although educated in Delhi at the behest of his parents. While Lao is bullish about most aspects of life in the wilderness, he does admit that there were moments when he worried about what might happen to them. 'In reality, there were moments with a . lot of self-doubt and uncertainty,' he says. 'My main worries were the education . and the sort of society they would grow up in.' With both now in their 30s, Lao's latest worry is what will happen to the estate after he's gone so to make life easier for his children, he's taken preparations in hand - including digging his own grave. 'Would be bloody funny if I kicked the bucket now,' he quips as he shows Fogle the waiting tomb. 'Welcome to my grave! This was dug many, many years ago,' he adds. 'I said: ""Let's be prepared for these things""!' Satisfied with life: Steve says his only regret is not flying his fighter plane over the farm . With his grave complete, he says his only worry left is whether his two children will be able to keep the estate intact after his death. 'In this day . and age with things all around us, slowly breaking up, you know law and . order and things like that, that's my only worry. 'How are they going to . look after this with people trying to make inroads and things like this?' Despite the challenges of life on a mountaintop and the uncertainty about what will happen after he's gone, Lao says he's missed out on nothing. 'The . only regret I have is that I never flew my fighter plane over my own . farm,' he chuckles. 'I've flown the length and breadth of India but never here. That's . my only regret.'

"By . John Hall . A fundraiser dubbed the 'British Forrest Gump' is celebrating after running the equivalent of 200 marathons across Canada dressed as comic book superhero The Flash. Jamie McDonald, 27, from Tredworth in Gloucestershire, completed the epic 5,000-mile coast-to-coast challenge in 275 days, during which he was mugged, beaten up and forced to sleep rough. He finally crossed the finish line in Vancouver yesterday, becoming the first person to run across the country without a support team - all the while raising £150,000 for charities dedicated to sick children. Tough: Jamie McDonald completed the epic 5,000-mile coast-to-coast challenge in 275 days, during which he was mugged, beaten up and forced to sleep rough . Nearing the end: Jamie McDonald finally crossed the finish line in Vancouver yesterday, becoming the first person to run across Canada without a support team . After completing his ambitious journey, Mr McDonald said: 'I just can't believe it's over.' 'I have worked for so long and given this run everything I have, physically and mentally, that to finally dip my hand into the Pacific Ocean 11 months and the equivalent of more than 200 marathons after going the same thing in the Atlantic Ocean is just incredible,' he added. 'Thinking about all the people that have helped me along the way, whether it was offering a bed, or handing me a coffee, it brings a tear to my eye,' he went on to say. Mr McDonald decided to run dressed as comic superhero The Flash after asking for costume requests on Facebook and Twitter. He originally took up the challenge to show gratitude for the care he received as a child when he suffered from a debilitating immune deficiency and a rare spinal condition called syringomyelia. Epic: Jamie McDonald's challenge began in March, using money he had saved for a mortgage to fund the trip. He has since passed through mountain ranges (pictured), national parks and run along numerous highways .

His epic challenge began in March, when using money he had saved for a mortgage to fund the trip, he touched down in St John's in the Canadian state of Labrador. He has since passed through mountain ranges, national parks and run along numerous highways. But as he celebrated New Year's Eve in ski resort Banff, Mr McDonald was beaten up and mugged, with a bag containing film footage of his adventure, as well as cash and credit cards, stolen. The bag was later returned following a Twitter campaign, but the robbery came as a huge setback.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . President Obama has once again argued that marijuana is just as dangerous as alcohol even after his own drug enforcement czar blasted the claims. 'I stand by my belief based on the scientific evidence that marijuana for casual users, individual users, is subject to abuse, just like alcohol is and should be treated as a public health problem and challenge,' he said during an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. He went on to stipulate that his motivation in speaking out on the topic isn’t so much focused on the health risks but more about the legal inequalities that come in handing down sentences for drug-related crimes. Sticking to his guns: President Obama said that he thinks the criminal sentences for marijuana do not match up to the severity of the drug and that should be fixed within the legal system . 'My concern is when you end up having very heavy criminal penalties for individual users that have been applied unevenly and, in some cases, with a racial disparity. I think that is a problem. ‘Over the long term, what I believe that if we can deal with some of the criminal penalty issues, then we can really tackle what is a problem not just for marijuana, but also alcohol, also cigarettes, also harder drugs and that is to see that our kids don't get into these habits in the first place. ‘The incarceration model that we have taken- particularly around marijuana- does not seem to produce the kind of goals that we've set. 'I think that is a problem. We're going to see what happens in the experiments in Colorado and Washington. The Department of Justice under Eric Holder has said that we are going to continue to enforce federal laws. Parsing the issue: He is still wary of wide-spread legalization because that could lead to increased marketing and promotion of the drug, and he views it should be viewed like similar 'vices' like alcohol and cigarettes . 'I think they have to ask themselves . some tough questions, too. Because if we start having a situation where . big corporations with lots of resources and distribution and marketing . arms are suddenly going out there, peddling marijuana, then the levels . of abuse that may take place are going to be higher,' he said. Mr . Obama has been open in his admissions about his own prior drug use, as . he first described his frequent dabbles with the drug in high school in . his memoir that was released when he was a Senator. The issue has come up again in recent weeks following an interview he gave to New Yorker editor David Remnick wherein he said that the drug is not as dangerous as it has been perceived and the laws surrounding it deserve to be revisited. The future: American opinion seems to be falling in line with Mr Obama following the recent legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington State. Above, a legal Denver dispensary . 'As has been well documented, I smoked pot as a kid, and I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life. I don’t think it is more dangerous,' Mr Obama said in the New Yorker interview. 'Middle-class kids don’t get locked up for smoking pot, and poor kids do,' he said. 'And African-American kids and Latino kids are more likely to be poor and less likely to have the resources and the support to avoid unduly harsh penalties.' 'We should not be locking up kids or individual users for long stretches of jail time when some of the folks who are writing those laws have probably done the same thing,' Mr Obama added.","President Obama stands by his calls to address the criminal charges around marijuana possession .

Beau Isagba, who also has convictions for carrying a blade and cannabis possession, wept as he heard he faced a long prison sentence. The 17-year-old can now be named after the judge took the unusual step of lifting reporting restrictions due to the public interest in the case after the student’s ordeal was seen by millions of people on YouTube. Scroll down for video . Lawless: A thief shamelessly rifles through Ashraf Rossli's bag as the young man stands bleeding after being punched in the face. The incident sparked national outrage . Beau Isagba, now 18, was last month found guilty of assaulting Malaysian student Ashraf Rossli during the London riots . Video footage of events after the attack became one of the most enduring images of the riots that appalled the world and shamed Britain. Dazed and bleeding heavily, Malaysian student Ashraf Rossli, is seen slumped on a pavement clutching his jaw after being punched by the yob who stole his bicycle. Minutes later, he is robbed by a gang posing as ‘Good Samaritans’ who rifle through his rucksack before fleeing, leaving him staggering in a daze. Yesterday the shaven-haired thug who broke the 20-year-old’s jaw and left him at the mercy of the muggers was facing jail after being convicted of grievous bodily harm and robbery. Isagba told the court he was ‘very, very ashamed’ of himself. But Judge Witold Pawlack told Wood Green Crown Court: ‘He is facing a long prison sentence and there is no reason that I can see why he should remain on bail now.’ Mr Rossli was cycling over a flyover in Barking, East London, with a friend on August 8, during the height of the looting and violence which swept the country. The accountancy student, from Kuala . Lumpur, managed to dodge past one group of hoodies who lunged at him. But he then felt a hand reach into his jacket pocket. As Mr Rossli turned round to look, he was hit in the face. The blow, which was not featured in the clip, smashed his jaw and threw him from his bicycle to the laughter of a gang of youths watching. Mr Rossli said: ‘The impact was hard. I fell to the ground. Blood was coming out of my mouth.’ Isagba was captured on CCTV pedalling off with Mr Rossli’s bike. Dazed and confused, blood dripping from his mouth, Ashraf Rossli is encircled by thugs after being savagely beaten to the ground during the violence in London .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A crafty tenant in a New York City apartment has figured out an ingenious scheme to keep her hands on the oft-sought gem of the New York real estate market: The coveted rent-controlled apartment. At 63 years old, Pamela Becker - who now calls herself 'Maria DeTommaso' - had herself legally adopted by an elderly retired dock worker so his $100-a-month, rent-controlled, two-bedroom apartment in the up-and-coming neighborhood of Long Island City, Queens, would go to her, the man's 'daughter.' Becker now is battling the couple who owns the building - who claim she has no right to live in the apartment at its rent-controlled price - in Queens Housing Court over whether she has any right to the apartment. Arrangement: Pamela set up the deal with her friend to secure a rent controlled apartment . Inheritance: Pamela Becker was adopted by Nicholas DeTommaso (pictured) so she could inherit his rent-controlled apartment . 'She has made my life a living hell,' Sugrim Outar, who owns the . small apartment building with his wife, said on the witness stand during a court hearing last week, the New York Post reports. According to the paper, Becker first came to the apartment building in the 1990s as a cat-sitter for a tenant. At some point, the former yoga instructor befriended DeTommaso - and she latched on. Neighbors say Becker would often take the old man shopping and spend time with him. Soon after, he started giving her gifts - including a 'series of cars.' By 2002, Becker had officially moved in with the older man, who in 2007 was diagnosed with dementia, at which point Becker was granted power of attorney for the ailing former dock worker. As the person in charge of making all of his financial and legal decisions, Becker became the beneficiary of his life insurance policy and his pension. Dispute: The argument is over this two bedroom apartment in Long Island City . Two bed: The apartment, pictured, would cost thousands of dollars a month to rent on the open market . However, she refused to marry him. 'Some people said I should marry him. I didn't want to marry him, that's . gross. I don't do stuff like that,' Becker told the Post. Rather, Becker had herself legally adopted by DeTommaso just weeks before his June 2009 death. Since DeTommaso's death, Becker has continued to live in the apartment - and pay the $100-a-month rent. Long Island City's proximity to Manhattan - one subway stop from Grand Central Station in midtown - as well as the construction of a collection of luxury high-rise apartment buildings over the last decade has rental prices in the area far higher than the $100-a-month Becker currently is paying to live in her 'father's' rent controlled apartment. High-rise: Real estate in Long Island City has skyrocketed in recent years due to luxury high-rises and its close proximity to midtown Manhattan . In 2013, the average price for a two-bedroom apartment in the emerging neighborhood was about $3,000. And that was after a $50-a-month increase from the previous year. The Outars were forced to withdraw their lawsuit against Becker due to technical issues. Sugrim Outar, however, says he plans to try and have Becker evicted from his property. 'I'm legally adopted,' Becker told the Post. 'I'm going to win this battle.'","Pamela Becker had herself adopted by an elderly man with dementia 22 days before he died so she could inherit his rent-controlled apartment .

"By . Margot Peppers . If you have an annoying habit of losing things, a new device that can be attached to any object and located with a smartphone app may be the solution to your problems. The Tile, a matchbook-sized square linked up to your iPhone or iPad via Bluetooth, lets you see how close you are to the missing item, within a 50 to 150-foot range. And even if the item travels out of this range, other smartphones with the same app can also detect it, and an alert is automatically sent to you if they have it in their range. Scroll down for video . Lost and found: With the Tile App, you can attach this matchbook-sized square any item, and track its whereabouts with Bluetooth via a smartphone app . Tiny technology: Each Tile costs $18.95, and you can link up your phone with up to ten Tiles - which will be available for shipping starting this winter . Each Tile costs $18.95, and you can link up your phone with up to ten Tiles - which will be available for shipping starting this winter. When you log into the app on your phone, it shows you, with green bars that increase or decrease, how close or far away you are from the tile. You can also program it to emit a beeping tone when you get close. The most interesting aspect of the app is its reliance on crowdsourcing; indeed, the website deems it 'the world's largest lost and found'. It allows you to share your access to . Tiles with friends, and to log into your Tile app from anyone else's . smartphone, and locate the Tile from there. Am I getting warmer? When you log into the app on your phone, it shows you, with green bars that increase or decrease, how close or far away you are from the Tile . Crowd-sourced: If your Tile goes out of your own phone's 150-foot Bluetooth range, you can set it as a 'lost item', which automatically puts all other phones with the app 'on the lookout' for your item . And if your lost object - a wandering . dog, for example, or a stolen bike - goes out of your own phone's . 150-foot Bluetooth range, you can set it as a 'lost item'. The Tile is linked up to your smartphone app via Bluetooth. It has a hole in it that makes it attachable to a keyring, and a double-sided adhesive that lets you stick it on to different objects. When you log onto the app, it tells you how close or far away you are from the Tile, within a 50 to 150-foot range. If the Tile goes out of this range, you can set it as a 'lost item', which automatically puts all other smartphones with the App 'on the lookout' for your Tile.

This automatically puts all other smartphones with the Tile app 'on the lookout' for your item. If any of these phones comes within range of your item, a message is sent to your own phone, alerting you to its location. The app also has the function to remember where it last saw your Tile, so that you can easily find where you left it. Since the Tiles use Bluetooth rather than GPS, they never run out of battery or need to be charged, and they last for one year before needing to be replaced. And even though the app uses the Cloud to alert you if your Tile is detected by other smartphones, this doesn't give other people access to your account.

"By . Lydia Warren . A 19-year-old model who posed nude and filmed graphic footage at her old Catholic high school has been sentenced to 45 days in jail. Valerie Dodds, known as Val Midwest online, said she was just going to treat the time at Lancaster County Jail, Nebraska as 'a really bad vacation'. 'I feel like I'm harmless as to what I . did, and they are definitely bringing the hammer as far as the . sentencing goes,' she told KETV before she reported to jail on Wednesday. She also sent out a tweet, saying: 'Jail bait baby'. Controversy: Valerie Dodds, 19, was charged with indecent exposure for taking nude pictures and footage at her old Catholic high school after classmates ridiculed her for wanting to model nude . Last June, Dodds was charged with indecent exposure after posing nude on the football field and inside Pius X High School and masturbating on campus. She said it was a way to get back at her former classmates and teachers who scorned her dream of working in the adult entertainment industry. She had attended the school before transferring to another school for her senior year. 'Everyone in my high school had something nasty to say to me when I started my website and so this is my tribute to all of you,' she wrote on her website, where she shared the racy footage and images. But days after baring it all, she received a ticket for trespassing and public nudity. 'Why would you give me a ticket for public nudity if I'm trespassing onto private property?' she asked. Trespassing: Dodds is pictured climbing over the fence at her former high school last June . Dodd's website manager, Shane Harrington, . added: 'It may be wrong, and some people may not agree, but I always . believe if you're attacked, you defend yourself.' After Dodds received a ticket, St Pius X school said in a statement that they would pursue the case if she had done anything illegal. 'We constantly follow our school's motto: . To Restore All Things In Christ,' the statement said. 'To that end, we are praying for the . young lady and her family, and we stand ready to offer forgiveness and . support should she seek it.' Not giving up: After her initial citation, she returned to the school - this time wearing nothing but stickers .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Three years ago Rachael Johnston was given just 48 hours to live after a four-year battle with anorexia left her weighing a mere 4½ stone. Her shocking decline was fuelled by an obsession with photo- graphs of super-slim celebrities in glossy magazines. Now aged 20 and a healthy size eight, she is determined others should not go through her ordeal and is demanding a ban on airbrushed images in magazines and adverts that are aimed at children. Recovering: Rachel Johnson was put on a drip in hospital after her weight plummeted, left, but having now recovered, right, the 20-year-old is campaigning to have images of super-skinny celebrities banned . An e-petition, launched with her . mother Lynne, urges the Government to bring in a ban or, failing that, . they want health warnings on airbrushed photos, similar to those that . appear on cigarette packets. Miss Johnston’s descent into anorexia began when, at 13, she started to idolise celebrities and obsess over their figures. She stuck magazine cuttings inside her . school locker and compiled motivational scrapbooks which she would pore . over to prevent herself from eating when she felt hungry. Desperate to . achieve a ‘celebrity figure’, she would survive on half an apple every . two days, and once went without food or water for ten days. Miss Johnston of Warrington, Cheshire, . said: ‘Although airbrushed images didn’t actually cause my eating . disorder, once I was unwell I would obsess over them. 'It wasn’t until . later that I realised what an effect these images can have and how they . affected the things I did or how I felt. ‘Although these glossy magazines . aren’t actually aimed at under 16s, they still read them. If an image . has been airbrushed it should say so and which parts of the body have . been altered. ‘People should be comfortable with who they are and not be ashamed to go out in public no matter how they look.’ Obsession: Rachel started to idolise slim stars when she was younger, including Victoria Beckham, left, and Nicole Richie, right, and began to starve herself in order the get the 'celebrity figure' Aged 13 in January 2005, Miss Johnston . was a healthy size 10-12, weighing eight stone, but she made a New . Year’s resolution to lose weight. By February 2006, her weight had . plummeted. She would restrict her food intake at school and on returning . home, tell her parents she had already eaten. The death of her grandmother . aggravated the illness. She switched to a vegetarian diet and secretly . did 1,000 sit-ups every morning and evening. She started making herself . sick after eating and disguised her shrinking frame with baggy clothes. The first of eight hospital admissions . over the course of her illness happened in March 2007 when she . collapsed at home. Speaking of her state of mind at the time, she said: . ‘I was cutting out pictures of models and celebrities and filling . scrapbooks with them. My obsession at the time was Victoria Beckham. I . would cut out images of her body and stick my face on the top. ‘I would write underneath, “This is what you have to be – she’s perfect”. Campaign: Rachael and mother Lynn have started a campaign to get airbrushing banned or at least captioned in magazine images . ‘I had them pinned up everywhere. I even took it in the hospital with me and stuck it in the wardrobe. ‘The longest I ever went without food and water was ten days. I don’t know how my body got through it.’ She was re-admitted to hospital for . five months in February 2009 after her weight plunged to 4½ stone and . she could only fit into children’s age 9-10 clothing. Three years on Miss Johnston is 5ft . 4in and a healthy size eight, although she has been left with . osteoporosis as a result of malnutrition. Miss Johnston said: ‘I’m still in . recovery, I have medication for depression and I have a very low immune . system. I do have osteoporosis in my back and knees, but it’s just a . case of getting on with it.’ Support: Rachael and mother Lynn need 100,000 signatures on their e-petition in order to get the Government to debate banning airbrushed images or at least having a health warning displayed on them . During her recovery she worked with Beat, an eating disorder charity, and still gives talks to youngsters about her ordeal. She added: ‘I love pizza and I love . chocolate. Even when I was really poorly it was something I still liked. I’ve got to be in the right mood to be able to eat it. I don’t want to . feel guilty afterwards. It’s the feelings that I struggle with.’ The e-petition, which requires 100,000 . signatures, calls for the Government to ‘ban airbrushing of all images . and adverts aimed at children in the UK’, stating that such images ‘give . a false representation of beauty’ and subject children to ‘completely . unattainable’ images. ÷ To join the petition go  to http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/31414 .","Rachel Johnson weighed little more than four stone during four-year battle with eating disorder .

"By . Sophie Borland . UPDATED: . 04:00 EST, 3 August 2011 . A super-salmonella bug that cannot be treated by any drug is on the rise in Britain, scientists warn. They think the strain originated in Egypt and is now being spread across Europe by contaminated fruit, vegetables and spices. So far at least 200 Britons have been infected with the bug known as Salmonella Kentucky since 2000. Super bug: Scientists think the new strain of Salmonella originated in Egypt and is now being spread across Europe by contaminated fruit, vegetables and spices . The scientists from the World Health Organisation warn that there have probably been many more cases which were never reported to health officials. Figures show that the number of Britons infected with this particular type has trebled over the past decade. In 2000 fewer than 20 cases were reported to the Health Protection Agency but this had gone up to 60 in 2008, the most recently available figures. It is not known if anyone has died from this strain. There are around 2,500 different types of salmonella bacteria across the world lurking in soil or in the intestines of animals. Most people catch the bug by eating infected chicken or eggs but it can also be spread by fruit or vegetables that have been contaminated in the soil. It isnâ€™t normally serious and symptoms include vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches and fever which clear up without treatment within a few days. Food poisoning: Most people catch salmonella by eating infected chicken, eggs or red meat . But it can be deadly in the elderly, young children and patients with long-term illnesses such as cancer and often they need antibiotics. Scientists from the Institut Pasteur at the World Health Organisation in Paris say that this particular type is resistant to all types of drugs. They are concerned it could spread very quickly around the world â€“ and could  prove deadly for the most vulnerable. The scientists, whose study is published in the Journal of Infectious Disease, looked at the number of reported cases in England and Wales, France, Denmark  and the U.S. between 2002 and 2008. They discovered that in all countries the number of cases had increased substantially. The scientists think that the strain originated in Egypt in the 1990s and has since spread to other African countries such as Morocco and Ethiopia through infected poultry. They think it is now being spread across Europe through contaminated spices, fruit or vegetables imported from Africa. Dr Le Hello, lead researcher, said: 'We hope that this publication might stir awareness among national and international health, food, and agricultural  authorities so that they take the necessary measures to control and stop the dissemination of this strain before it spreads globally.'","Salmonella Kentucky strain is thought to come from Egypt .

"By . James Rush . Three lapdancers and their female agent were yesterday cleared of kidnapping a nightclub boss in a dispute over unpaid fees. Curtis Woodman had claimed he was bundled into a car and driven to a field where he was beaten up after refusing to pay the women. He said he had withheld the money after being forced to close his temporary strip club where they worked because the women had refused to keep some clothes on, breaking the terms of the venue’s licence. Actress Charlotte Devaney (second from left) and lapdancers Mandy Cool (left), Rachel Goodchild (second from right) and Stephanie Pye (right) have been cleared of kidnapping a club boss who failed to pay them £42,000 in wages . Rachel Goodchild, Stephanie Pye, Mandy Cool and Charlotte Devaney celebrate after being cleared at Bristol Crown Court . But Mandy Cool, 29, Rachel Goodchild, 24, Stephanie Pye, 31, and their agent Charlotte Devaney, 34, claimed they should have been paid their share of the takings – including half of a £42,000 bill racked up by just one customer. Mr Woodman claims they set up a kidnapping to force him to pay up. But Miss Devaney told the jury he had concocted the kidnap story to avoid paying his debts. ‘You don’t make girls take their clothes off and then not pay them to work. It is not a moral thing to do.’ Charlotte Devaney (left) and Stephanie Pye . (right), both pictured outside Bristol Crown Court today, have been . cleared of kidnapping Curtis Woodman . Rachel Goodchild (left) and Mandy Cool (right) had also denied a charge of kidnapping Mr Woodman and were cleared today . The four women and brothers Robert Morris, 27, and Alexander Morris, 23, were all found not guilty of kidnap following a three and a half week trial at Bristol Crown Court. Speaking outside court, Miss Devaney said: ‘It is the right verdict. We are now looking forward to getting on with our lives.’ Civil proceedings against Mr Woodman for the share of £42,000 are ongoing. Robert Morris was also acquitted of robbery. Alexander Morris was convicted of two counts of robbery – taking Mr Woodman’s £4,650 Breitling watch and £60 in cash. Robert Morris (left) has also been cleared after . he denied kidnap along with two counts of robbery. His brother Alex . Morris (right) has been convicted of two robbery charges .

Devaney (pictured, right, in 2009) said: 'It is the right verdict. We . are now looking forward to getting on with our lives now' The court had heard how the women confronted Mr Woodman in September 2012, six months after the Cheltenham Festival. They turned up at the 34-year-old’s office in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, in miniskirts and high heels, accompanied by the Morris brothers. The court heard the two men had been enlisted because the women feared Mr Woodman saw them as ‘ditsy strippers’. Tempers then flared when Mr Woodman described the women as ‘a bunch of prostitutes’ and Robert Morris, who was Mandy Cool’s boyfriend, attacked him, it was claimed.

Devaney said 19 girls were left unpaid after the closure and constantly phoned her to find out where their earnings were . Devaney spent months chasing Mr Woodman for payment before driving to confront him with the three dancers and the Morris brothers . Devaney told the jury that Mr Woodman had concocted the kidnap story to avoid paying his debts . He says he was punched once in the head before being taken behind a hay bale where Robert Morris continued to punch and kick him. Mr Woodman claimed he was driven a short way along the M5 motorway before Alexander Morris produced a Stanley knife and insisted Mr Woodman hand over his watch. Robert Morris told the court that Mr Woodman’s account of the ‘kidnap’ was ridiculous. He said: ‘There are four women dressed in mini-skirts, daisy dukes and high heels, we stood out, you couldn’t have missed us. I’m a black guy in a tight T-shirt, we all stood out, why did no one spot us if we kidnapped him like he says?’ At the beginning of the trial Alexander Morris admitted carrying a bladed article on the day of the alleged kidnap. He will be sentenced for that in two weeks’ time, together with the two robbery convictions.

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Phil Tufnell has admitted he is not embarrassed to have had cosmetic surgery to halt the signs of ageing on his hairline. The former cricketer, 47, said having a hair transplant to rejuvenate his thinning locks was not a 'big deal' and he was happy to harness new technology to boost his barnet. He said: 'Years ago there was nothing we could do about these things. If you lost your hair you couldn't get it back but it's ­different now,' he told The Mirror. Happy: Phil Tufnell is pleased with the results of his hair transplant . Reversing signs of ageing: The area is yet to fully heal but should give the former cricketer thicker locks where he was receding . Why not? The star thinks men should make the most of modern technology to boost their barnets . He added: 'This is just hopefully going to be natural, give me a bit thicker hair where I was receding, so why not? I was ­starting to recede.' The former Strictly Come Dancing star and I'm A Celebrity champion said he undertook the procedure at DHI Global in London with the full support of his wife, Dawn. He said he doesn't care if he gets mocked for it by his sportsmen peers and has been proud to show off the results via his Twitter account. Spot the difference: Tufnell following treatment, left, and earlier this month on the Strictly Come Dancing tour, right, where his hair was beginning to thin on top . 'Revolutionary' technique: He had the treatment at DHI Global whose surgeons can remove up to 6000 individual hairs from one part of the head or body and then replant them . Laugh all you like: Tufnell said he doesn't mind if he's mocked for having the hair transplant . He has also participated in a webinar for his cosmetic surgeons to answer questions from other men who are thinking of following his lead. He explained: 'I think loads of guys are going to . start doing it a bit more now, like with all sorts of stuff. With teeth . whitening. If your teeth are wonky you can do something about it. Remember that 20 years ago you couldn't do that. You had to live with what you had.' The former England spinner admitted cricket has become a lot more 'metrosexual' since his days at the crease, when all he needed was a toothbrush 'and a bit of underarm' in his wash bag when touring. The Question Of Sport captain is happy to answer questions on how the treatment works and took part in a webinar for DHI Global . 'Never say never': He added that he hasn't ruled out Botox . He added that he would 'never say never' to further cosmetic treatments such as Botox but wouldn't go as far as Australian Shane Warne in his pursuit of beauty. He said: 'I'm not going to go that far. I haven't had a fake tan since I finished Strictly in 2009. Shane looked so different but I don't really see it as something to rib ­someone about.' Tufnell shared a selfie of his hair transplant with his Twitter followers last week stating: 'Day 1. Job done. Piece of cake! #TuffersBarnet.' Proud: Phil Tufnell shows off the results of his hair restoration treatment . He later even credited his new do as being a lucky charm for the England cricket team who recently suffered a humiliating 5-0 defeat against Australia in The Ashes. On Friday, the Alastair Cook led team scored a victory against the Australians in a one day international. The victory prompted Tufnell to tweet: 'The day after my new barnet England start winning! Coincidence?? I don't think so. Good work @DHIGLOBAL' DHI Global are the international company he turned to for his treatment. On their website they promise natural results using the latest 'revolutionary techniques that eliminates the use of scalpels.' They add that 'best of all the procedure is pain free'. Work in progress: The former cricketer was seen taking a cigarette break while at DHI Global for the treatment . Expensive fix: Tufnell visited the London hair implantation branch. They recommend people have four sessions for the best results at a cost of £20,000 . Tufnell was pictured outside their London clinic last week having a cigarette between treatments whilst wearing a plastic cover over his head. Konstantinos Giotis, founder DHI Medical Group, said they recommend four sessions for the best results at a cost of £20,000. He added that men and women interested in the treatment can start with just one session of £3,000 if they prefer. The clinic Tufnell visited: The group say they use innovative methods that are painfree . The company explain on their website how the procedure is carried out under local anaesthetic. The surgeons can remove up to 6000 individual hairs from one part of the head or body and then replant them in follicles on the head where hair has thinned. The group say their method is superior to skin grafts using scalpels as it eliminates stitches and scarring. They say patients will see the results within 16 weeks. Turning back the clock: The cricketer with a full head of hair in his youth, left, and before the recent restoration treatment, right . Tufnell tweeted before his first treatment that he was 'nervous but excited to see the results' and is clearly already pleased with the results.

"By . John Hall . Components originating from Britain are being used inside North Korean missiles, a UN report has claimed. Temperature gauges, pressure gauges and generic resistors manufactured by unidentified companies based in Britain were found among debris recovered from the sea after a North Korea missile test in December 2012, the UN Panel of Experts concluded in an 127-page report. The discovery has led to questions over how British parts found their way into North Korea's illegal programme to manufacture intercontinental ballistic missiles - especially as the country is currently under UN sanctions banning the delivery of military goods. Scroll down for video . Launch: Gauges and resistors manufactured by British companies were found in among the debris of an Unha-3 rocket (right) that North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un (left) ordered to be test fired in December 2012 . As well as the British equipment, parts made in the U.S., Switzerland, and China were discovered among the debris of an Unha-3 rocket that crashed after an event Pyongyang described as a satellite launch. The U.S. said the satellite claims were nonsense however, adding that North Korea had in fact been testing intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Panel of Experts described all the British parts found in the missile as 'off-the-shelf items that do not meet any of the specifications in the lists of prohibited items, in particular the ballistic missile-related list.' The report said that all the British items had entered North Korea through third party countries - including Taiwan - with some of them arriving as recently as 2011. The report did not name the manufacturers of the items. Dispute: The U.S. said Pyongyang's claims that the Unha-3 rocket was a satellite were nonsense, adding that North Korea was in fact continuing to test military weapons (pictured) Evidence: Although the foreign parts may have found their way into North Korea innocently, the UN report said they proved Kim Jong-un's ability 'to assemble complex systems with globally sourced components' Only one foreign item found among the debris met some but not all of the criteria defined by the list of items banned from being exported into North Korea under the current UN sanctions. These were radial ball bearings found inside the turbo pumps of the four rocket motors. However the report said these items were likely to have been made in the 1980s in the former Soviet Union, so could easily have passed into North Korea long before the UN restrictions were installed. Although the foreign parts may have found their way into North Korea innocently, the UN report said they proved Pyongyang's ability 'to assemble complex systems with globally sourced components'. 'The acquisition of components abroad for its prohibited programmes despite its Juche philosophy of self-reliance points to the limitations of its own industrial production capabilities,' the report added. Ready for action: Earlier this week it was reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un told his military chiefs to prepare the nation's soldiers (pictured) for war against South Korea in 2015 . Within the report, a number of Taiwanese companies and individuals were named as being suspected of purchasing dual-use components on behalf of North Korea. The UN said this aspect of the report would need further investigation. This is not the first time dual-use components have found their way an international debate about military sanctions. In 1998 Iraq's then leader Saddam Hussein launched 'Project Babylon' - a campaign with objectives that remain unclear to this day but involved plans to build a series of 'superguns'. Dual-use components have long been part of the debate about military sanctions. In 1988 Saddam Hussein launched a campaign to assemble 'superguns' using metal tubes built in Britain (pictured) Many of the parts for the weapons were made from dual-use items made by various companies in Europe - including metal tubes for the barrels and gun cradles purchased from Sheffield Forgemasters in South Yorkshire and Walter Somers in Worcestershire. The majority of the parts were seized in transit and destroyed, but the resulting debate over the export of dual-use items led to more stringent restrictions on what could be exported to countries that were under sanctions. Earlier this week it was reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un told his military chiefs to prepare for war against South Korea in 2015. According to South Korea's largest daily newspaper, a source has revealed that the dictator plans to invade and has ordered the army to remain 'combat-ready'.","British gauges and resistors found among debris of Unha-3 rocket .

"By . Vincent Graff . My new best friend has some advice for me. 'Don’t take yourself too seriously,' says Frankie Wales, a pretty 28-year-old dance instructor who has just stepped into my life. 'If you don’t quite understand what I’m doing, keep moving. And let yourself go.' It’s an order, rather than a request, but it’s delivered so sweetly – a peculiar mixture of authority and concern, like a country policeman who’s just found the local headmaster whose satnav has sent him the wrong way – that I do my best to obey. I’m at my very first zumba class – and Frankie is my teacher. I’ve spent the last five years of my life walking past leaflets and posters advertising this fitness craze, and now finally I’ve succumbed. Fish out of water: Vince, centre, went to his first zumba class - and says he seemed to be going in one direction while everyone else went in the other . I call it a craze. But it’s gone way beyond that. Invented nearly 20 years ago by a Colombian dance choreographer named Alberto Perez, zumba is now practised all over the world. It’s estimated that 140 million people have taken part in zumba  – a dance fitness programme, based around Latin music – in 185 countries. Yet, here in Britain at least, there are precious few men who do it. 'I don’t know why men come to zumba so rarely,' says Frankie, who has taught just a 'handful' of chaps in the three years she’s been holding regular classes. 'I’m always telling men that it was a bloke who invented it.' I’m in Uppingham, a beautiful market . town in the county of Rutland. Glorious sandstone and limestone . buildings line the streets and market square. But I’m cocooned inside a bright, shiny gymnasium – and there’s fast, rhythmic music pounding from the speakers. Meanwhile, . Frankie is pointing to her shoulders, pointing to her toes, imploring . us – gently, kindly – to leap here, clap there, and jump to our left and . right while waving our arms to the right and the left. (So confusing!). Getting stuck in: Instructor Frankie, left, told Vincent to let himself go and not to worry if people are watching - and Vince says by the end of the class, he manages just that . My heart is beating, my legs and arms are moving. Just not necessarily in the same direction as Frankie’s. Put it like this: if she’s Ginger Rogers, I’m Freddie Starr. But does it matter? Let’s say that, at the start of the class, I haven’t yet made up my mind. So why have I come to this particular zumba class? Rutland . is Britain’s smallest county (there are just two towns, and not a . single city, within it) but it is part of a big, bold challenge. Earlier . this month, more than 100 local residents turned up early on a crisp . winter morning to a public hall in the neighbouring town of Oakham. They’d all been invited along to have their blood cholesterol measured. If . their cholesterol was above the government’s recommended level, they . were asked if they wanted to take part in a community challenge. The . plan was see whether, working in concert with their friends and . neighbours, a whole community (or at least a good chunk of it) could . collectively lower its cholesterol.* . The volunteers agreed to alter their diets – fewer saturated fats, please, and more fruit and vegetables – and exercise more. They’d also consume products from the . Flora pro.activ range – which has been shown to lower cholesterol when . consumed as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle*. Community spirit: The class was arranged by Flora as part of its initiative to reduce cholesterol among residents of Rutland. 'This is a close-knit part of the world,' says one. 'People pull together' Then, three weeks after they started, the local residents will have their cholesterol measured again – and see how well they’ve done. The zumba class attendees here today seem to like the way this health challenge – individuals joining together to achieve a common good – has brought the community closer. 'This is a close-knit part of the world. People pull together,' says 66-year-old former English teacher Margaret Day. It’s clear local people are taking the challenge seriously. It’s 10am on a Tuesday morning but the people here are not the usual zumba suspects but ordinary folk from all walks of life, in all shapes and sizes. I chat to women in their 40s, 50s and 60s; fit folk who take plenty of exercise anyway to  larger types who are new to zumba. One by one, the locals have lined up to tell me that it doesn’t matter that I think I can’t dance. So does the chap who’s been sent along by Flora pro.activ to make sure we’ve all got what we need. And the amazing thing is that a few minutes into the class, I realise the truth: so what if I don’t keep up with every step? My eyes are fixed on Frankie and her instructions. And – crucially – so are everybody else’s. No one is spending a moment watching my dancing, how I’m getting on. It takes all your concentration to keep your own show on the road. There’s no time to pass judgment on others. So, I follow Frankie’s advice. If I get a step wrong, I just keep moving. And no one notices apart from me.And soon even I stop caring about that. At the end, I feel hot, sweaty – and like I’ve achieved something. Frankie says I’ve done jolly well. And even if I don’t believe her, I’ve ended up rather enjoying myself. How did I allow that to happen?* Flora pro.activ contains plant sterols, which have been shown to lower blood cholesterol: scientific tests demonstrate that consuming 1.5-2.4g of plant sterols per day can lower cholesterol by 7-10% in 2-3 weeks when consumed as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle with sufficient fruit and vegetables.","Vincent has spent five years walking past posters advertising fitness craze .

"By . Ted Thornhill . At least ten tigers have been butchered in China in front of rich businessmen and officials who ordered the killings for entertainment – and to show off their wealth - it's been reported. The animals, which are protected by law, were slaughtered in Zhanjiang city in the country’s Guangdong province and police have arrested 15 people over the killings, which they said first began in 2006. The suspects could face the death penalty if found guilty. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Investigation: The police seized a video showing men apparently electrocuting a tiger in a cage . Raid: Police found the film, said to have been shot in 2012, when they arrested the gang members . It’s not clear how the tigers were killed in each instance, but it’s likely that they were drugged first before being put on display for those watching and then butchered. One male suspect, aged 61, apparently died while leaping from a building in a desperate attempt to escape a police raid on March 19, according to Ecns.com. He butchered pigs for a living, according to the site. Police spokesman Long She said the gang were facing the death penalty if convicted of poaching and killing the rare big cats. He said: 'As far as we can work out they started operating in 2006 and we have confirmed there were more than 10 tiger deaths as a result of their activities. We suspect there may be more. Under Chinese law the tiger is a grade one endangered species - and anyone convicted of poaching the animals faces the death penalty.' Horrific footage that apparently shows the gang electrocuting a tiger in a cage in 2012 was seized by police and has since been uploaded to YouTube. The tigers were killed simply as entertainment for officials and businessmen, and as a way of flaunting wealth, according to China Daily. WWF said there there may only be 3,200 wild tigers left in the world – and just 50 in China. It said: ‘Tiger skins are still in demand as luxury items in some countries, and tiger parts coveted for their ""medicinal"" properties. Supposed health benefits: Many people in China believe consuming certain tiger parts is good for them (file picture) Endangered: There are only around 3,200 wild tigers left - and about 50 in China . 'The tigers’ forest habitat is vanishing too. Destruction of forests for timber, agriculture and road building has forced tigers into ever-smaller areas, where they’re even more vulnerable to poachers. 'Poachers also hunt the tiger’s prey species, and tigers are forced to target domestic animals, bringing them into fatal conflict with local people.’ One scientist said that tigers will always be in danger if Chinese people continue to believe that their parts have health benefits. ‘Tigers are subjected to slaughter as long as Chinese have faith in the medical value of tiger products, such as their bones or male genitalia, which are actually very controversial in terms of their efficacy,’ Xie Yan, an expert from the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, told the Global Times. ‘Tigers are first class national protected animals in our country and it's illegal to raise tigers without a certificate.

"By . Chris Pleasance . If you have ever been to a football match, it will come as no surprise to find that fans like to swear. Researchers looking at fans' tweets during football matches found that around one in 20 tweets about the beautiful game contains some form of profanity. But perhaps more surprising was that discovery that swearing is usually directed at their own team, rather than match officials or opponents - with Liverpool fans among the worst offenders. Analysis of football fans' tweets during games has found that they mostly swear about their own teams . Researchers found that Liverpool fans were most likely to swear when talking about their team . The team of researchers found that roughly one in 20 tweets about football contains a profanity . The study, carried out by RGU's Dr Emma Byrne and Dr David Corney, looked at tweets about English Premier League matches on Saturday afternoons over three consecutive weeks. They collected an average of just over 125,000 tweets during the allotted analysis period on each match day. Analysis revealed that almost 6,500 tweets, or just over 5 per cent, contained the two most common swearwords in the English language. While fans used swear words to express frustration with their team or opponents' foul play, at other times they were used in expressions of celebration or humour. The research paper concludes: 'Through a careful analysis of a collection of tweets about football that contain swearing, we have shown that bad language is not always negative; that the wider context is often crucial to interpret meaning; and that perhaps counter-intuitively, some of the strongest sentiments expressed are self-critical.' It goes on: 'We have seen that fans of English Premier League teams often swear about or at their own team, and relatively rarely about an opposing team or match officials. Researchers found that Liverpool fans were the most likely to swear about their own team (file pic) The team from Robert Gordon University concluded that swearing online is not always negative, and among football fans is often used as a show of passion . 'It may be that swearing is being used as a means of demonstrating affiliation to a particular group, or to demonstrate greater passion about their own team and an apparent indifference to all others.' Reflecting on the research, Dr Byrne said: 'It's no secret that football fans like to swear. But what's surprising is how and why they swear. 'For example, we found that fans are even more likely to swear when something great happens - when their team scores a goal, for example - than they are when something bad occurs.' One aspect which might surprise the casual fan is the extent to which diehards swear about their own team, researchers said. 'We found that Liverpool fans in particular were fantastic for this.' added Dr Byrne, a supporter of the team herself. 'Even when they've just scored, Liverpool fans always find something to gripe about.' Fans were also found swearing at their own team more often than match officials, despite controversial decisions (pictured, referee Andre Marriner sends off Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs after mistaking him for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain) Dr Corney, senior research fellow at RGU's innovation, design and sustainability research institute, said: 'There's a serious side to this research. 'Sentiment mining - the attempt to understand what emotions people are expressing in their online social networks - is huge business. 'Until now, many sentiment miners had taken the rather naive view that swearing is always a sign of anger or frustration. 'Our research shows that this is not the case - that swearing can also be an intensifier that is used at times of elation or excitement.' The research paper, entitled Sweet FA: sentiment, swearing and soccer, is to be presented next week at a multimedia conference.","Researchers looked at 125,000 fans' tweets over three Saturdays .

The six-tonne pile was found after stray dogs were seen carrying around the heads in the village of Druzhino . ‘We couldn't work out where they were getting them from initially, but after taking one of the heads away we then followed the dog when it ran back to the site to get another one. ‘We were stunned to find a huge amount of pigs' heads had been dumped by the stream.’ The head of the Veterinary Department Omsk, Vladimir Plaschenko, said: ‘This is a very serious offence, especially as it was dumped so close to a water supply. ‘We have tested the heads and none of the animal had any diseases but the rotting meat still posed a considerable health threat to the villagers and others further downstream.

Tests are currently being carried out on the heads to try and work out if it is possible to identify where they were from and more importantly where they ended up before being butchered.

About two weeks ago, the government announced that the only haircut allowed would be the Dear Leader haircut favoured by Kim Jong-Un.

According to local media, the style is more commonly associated with Chinese smugglers, rather than the nation’s leader. ‘Until the mid-2000s, we called it the “Chinese smuggler haircut”,’ the Korea Times writes. ‘Our leader's haircut is very particular, if you will,’ one source told Radio Free Asia. ‘It doesn't always go with everyone since everyone has different face and head shapes.’ The new hair regulation is a further trim on previous rules, which saw men forced to choose between ten different styles. Women were spoiled with a full 18 haircuts to choose from. A Kim trim: The ¿dear leader¿-haircut now forced upon male students in North Korea is a closely shaved undercut and floppy curtains .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . 'Only joking': Lewis Hamilton, 24, was jailed for two years yesterday for aggravated burglary . An incompetent armed burglar has been jailed after he was recognised by his old manager halfway through trying to rob the pub where he used to work. Lewis Hamilton, 24, who had been sacked from his job as a barman at the Trading Room pub in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, then tried to pass his crime off as a joke. Hamilton stormed into the pub armed with a six-inch knife 13 days after losing his job there. When he came through the door he had his face covered by his jacket and a scarf. He then demanded money from his former manager, Holly McDonald, but his makeshift disguise slipped and he was immediately recognised. He then tried to laugh off the incident, and even tried to bribe Ms McDonald with half his takings, but left empty-handed and was apprehended by police. Hamilton , of Chelmsford, Essex, was sentenced to two years in prison at Basildon Crown Court yesterday after he pleaded guilty to aggravated burglary. The court heard that after his cover was ruined, Hamilton, still wielding his knife, said: 'Don’t worry - I am only joking.' He then tried to claim he was simply returning his uniform despite not having it with him. He had been fired 13 days previously when it emerged he had been sacked from a former pub job after he didn't pay off his food tab. He returned on 27 October 2013 and broke in through a fire exit. Charlotte Davison, prosecuting, told the court: “Ms McDonald heard someone outside the office and saw the door move. 'She called out: ""Are you going to come in, then?"" The door flew open and the defendant appeared in front of her. Stormed: Hamilton attempted to burgle his former place of work, the Trading Room pub in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex . 'She did not recognise him at first as he had the top of his coat covering his face. He was holding a kitchen knife with a six-inch blade and asked her to hand over the money on the desk.' The makeshift disguise, which included a scarf wrapped around his head, fell down revealing Hamilton’s face as he demanded she hand over money which was being cashed up. It was then he attempted to laugh off his crime, desperately offering his former boss half of the stolen money, but he left without anything and was arrested later that evening. Ms Davison concluded saying: 'Ms McDonald said the whole experience felt unreal and she was left in shock.'","Lewis Hamilton, 24, tried to rob the Trading Room pub with a six-inch knife .

"By . Jack Doyle . Prescription drug addicts are abusing the NHS to feed their habits by ‘doctor shopping’ around different GP surgeries, MPs warn today. The Home Affairs Committee report revealed as many as 1.5million people are addicted to prescription drugs in the UK. It found fears many visit multiple GP practices to secure drugs and feed their habit. Among the most popular are painkillers such as diazepam and Tramadol. Diazepam: Drug addicts are feeding their addiction by 'doctor shopping' at different surgeries . The committee urged GPs to start collecting data on patients they suspect are hooked on prescribed drugs so the problem can be combated. They warned of ‘catastrophic consequences’ if nothing was done. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘There are currently 1.5 million people addicted to prescription drugs in the UK. ‘The abuse of these types of substances is taking place in the shadows and its extent is still unquantified. ‘Local GPs need to report their suspicions and collate information to illuminate this problem.’ Data should be made anonymous to ensure patient confidentiality is protected, the report said. The cross-party group of MPs concluded: ‘We recommend that medical practices start an anonymous data collection of those patients who have been proven to be, or a medical professional has reasonable suspicion of being, addicted to prescription drugs and how they are being supplied.’ The report also warned that GPs nurses and other health staff could escape prosecution even if they illegally supply prescription drugs. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee said: ‘GPs already play a key role in treating patients in the community suffering from the impact of drug addiction. ‘It is a devastating medical condition that ruins lives, families and communities and it is right that we continuously look at how we can improve drug addiction treatment. ‘However, the identification of individuals addicted to prescription drugs is not straight forward and whilst we should do all we can to support their withdrawal from such drugs, we also need to ensure that patients are confident that their sensitive personal data will remain secure.’ Legal highs: Legal high abuse is more significant in suburban and rural areas . Deaths from the drugs - which mimic the effects of banned substances like cocaine and ecstasy but are designed to stay outside the law - have increased by 80 per cent in just a year. The report warned the problem will get worse and new drugs will continue to emerge unless ‘immediate action’ is taken. Legal high abuse is more significant in suburban and rural areas, it warned - and called for tougher action to target suppliers. Ministers have launched a review of the laws governing legal highs.","Drug addicts are feeding addiction by 'doctor shopping' at surgeries .

"By . Jill Reilly . Warning: U.S. President Barack Obama at a press conference during the EU-U.S. summit in Brussels where he warned against cutting military budgets . 'Freedom isn't free,' warned U.S. President Barack Obama today, as his defence chief claimed that Russia has continued to build up its forces at Ukraine's eastern border. The Kremlin last week assured the U.S. that it would not send troops into east Ukraine, but Chuck Hagel claimed 'the reality is that they continue to build up their forces.' 'They [the Russians] need to make sure they stay committed to what Minister (Sergei) Shoigu told me,' the Pentagon chief said after meeting his British counterpart, Philip Hammond. Meanwhile, the cold conflict turned hot in Crimea where Russian assault teams in speedboats and helicopters captured a Ukrainian ship and moved it to a Russian military port. Mr Hagel's claims of a Russian military build-up came as Barack Obama said he was concerned that some Nato members are cutting spending on weapons and soldiers. The U.S. president spoke at a news conference with in Brussels after meeting with European Union leaders to discuss the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. He said that for collective defence to work, everybody has to pitch in and Nato can't just rely on U.S. and British efforts. 'I have had some concerns about a diminished level of defense spending by some of our partners in Nato,' Obama said. 'The situation in Ukraine reminds us that our freedom isn't free.' The President also met today also with Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who says the trans-Atlantic alliance will increase its military cooperation with Ukraine and help the country to modernise its armed forces. U.S. defence officials claim that there are now more than 20,000 Russian troops, including airborne units, fighter aircraft and armoured vehicles, deployed near the Ukrainian border.

The President also met with Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen who announced plans to step up military cooperation with Ukraine and help the country to modernise its armed forces . Amid concerns among Nato states in Eastern Europe over Russia's actions in Ukraine, Mr Hammond, Britain's defence secretary, vowed that the alliance was fully committed to defend the sovereignty of its members. 'I don't think any member of NATO has any doubt that all 28 members are prepared to come to the security interests, if that's what's required, to defend the integrity and sovereignty of those member countries,' he said. The comments came on a dramatic day in Crimea, where shots rang out and explosions rumbled as Russian special forces seized the last Ukrainian ship left on the peninsula. The Ukrainian Defence Ministry confirmed to Fox News that the ship is being moved by the tug boat to a Russian military port facility in the Bay of Donuslav.

"By . Emily Allen . UPDATED: . 16:04 EST, 11 January 2012 . They were the secret messages of resistance that Hitler’s henchmen failed to spot. Held in a Nazi camp, Major Alexis Casdagli whiled away the long hours sewing samplers in cross-stitch. His captors were so impressed by his pretty needlework they even put it on display in the camp. Yet not one of them spotted the coded messages he had stitched into his designs – which read ‘God Save the King’ and ‘F*** Hitler’. Passive resistance: Major Alexis Casdagli created this stitched tapestry in captivity in Germany. The inner border reads 'God Save The King' in Morse Code while the outer border reads 'F*** Hitler' The subversive samplers have since been displayed at the Victoria & Albert museum in London as a testament to a British soldier who never lost his fighting spirit. Defiant: Major Alexis Casdagli pictured during the war. The sampler was created using red and blue thread from a disintegrating pullover . ‘It used to give him pleasure when the Germans were doing their rounds,’ his 79-year-old son, Tony Casdagli, said. ‘It also stopped him going mad. He would say after the war the Red Cross saved his life, but his embroidery saved his sanity.’ Major Casdagli, of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, began sewing six months into his time at a camp in Dossel-Warbung, Germany. He made his seemingly innocent sampler using red and blue thread from the jumper of a fellow inmate, a Cretan army general. Around the swastikas and a banal inscription, he also stitched a border of irregular dots and dashes – containing the messages in Morse code. His work was displayed for years at the camps in Germany where he was held. If discovered, the messages of resistance could have put his life in jeopardy, his son said. ‘He was so good at sewing the Germans had him giving classes to his fellow officers,’ he added. ‘But they never worked out his code.’ His son, a retired Royal Navy officer who lives in London with his wife Sally, told how another of Major Casdagli’s rebellious works featured a Union Flag. On it he stitched a flap with ‘do not open’ written on it, as showing the flag was banned in Nazi Germany. Prisoner: Major Casdagli created the sampler while in captivity at a prisoner of war camp in Dossel-Warbung, pictured, in Germany in 1941. He was in captivity at various camps for four years . ‘Each week the same officer would open the flap and say, “This is illegal,” and Pa said, “You’re showing it, I’m not”.’ Major Casdagli was held captive between 1941 and 1945, in four camps. He continued to sew until his death in 1990, at the age of 90. Reunited: Tony Casdagli, Major Casdagli's son, now has the sampler after it was displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London recently . When Mr Casdagli was 11 his father sent him this stitched letter which read: 'It is 1,581 days since I saw you last but it will not be long now. Do you remember when I fell down the well?

"By . Simon Walters . and Glen Owen . UPDATED: . 05:46 EST, 13 November 2011 . Tony Blair is facing questions after one of his charities launched a bid to grab a slice of Britain's £8billion foreign aid budget. His organisation has taken the first steps to become eligible for grants awarded by the Department for International Development to rebuild war-torn countries. The highly sensitive move has prompted concerns over a possible conflict of interest with Mr Blair's complex business dealings. Tony Blair is being made an honorary Paramount Chief in the village of Mahera in Sierra Leone. Of his estimated £7m-a-year earnings, about £2m comes from merchant bank JP Morgan, which has major interests in many of the countries receiving British aid . Of his estimated £7 million-a-year earnings, about £2 million comes from merchant bank JP Morgan, which has major interests in many of the countries receiving British aid. Mr Blair's charity has applied to join the tendering process for the Department for International Development (DfID) 'security and governance' scheme, which undertakes 'peace-building' work in countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. The remit has raised eyebrows given the former Premier's disastrous decision to back the Iraq War. Last night, Conservative MPs said Mr Blair must prove that the pitch would not conflict with his lucrative commercial activities. Tory Philip Davies said: 'This is a very sensitive issue. The Government will have to be scrupulously careful with the award of any contracts to Mr Blair to ensure there can be no possible conflict of interest with his widespread business dealings in the Third World.' However, when asked about MPs' fears  that the application could conflict with Mr Blair's business activities, a spokesman for the former Prime Minister said: 'On what basis do they claim there is a conflict? There is none, and to claim or imply otherwise is defamatory.' Mr Blair has applied to be considered for grants via the Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative. Curiously, the application has been made in the name of the Tony Blair Governance Initiative, omitting the word Africa. Mr Blair's spokesman said the charity only operated in Africa. Ex-PM Tony Blair talks with health workers at Rokupa Government Hospital in Freetown on a visit to Sierra Leone, where his charity and JP Morgan operate, last year . The charity is run from the same office in London's Grosvenor Square as his business empire, the Office of Tony Blair. They share the same PO Box address in Paddington and are registered at the same address near St James's Park. The PO Box address is also shared by Cherie Blair's Foundation For Women charity. DfID – the Whitehall department whose budget will rise to £11 billion by 2015 – is spending £787 million this year on 'governance and security' schemes. Of this, £34 million is going to Afghanistan and £1.7 million to Iraq. Large sums also go to African and other Asian countries. Individual contracts can  be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. It is believed that some are worth millions, although a DfID spokesman refused to confirm this. A secret DfID document seen by The Mail on Sunday shows Mr Blair's name on the list of those who have applied for 'Lot A' of the DfID governance portfolio. If successful, his charity would then be on a list  of organisations eligible to bid for contracts as they came up. Others on the application list include the 'Big Four' accountancy giants – Ernst & Young, KPMG, Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers – plus charities such as Save The Children and Christian Aid. Philip Davies MP warned Mr Blair is entering a very sensitive area of policy and the Government will have to be careful when awarding contracts . The document suggests that Mr Blair's record in Iraq and Afghanistan could be significant, as it states: 'Bidders should describe their approach to operating in conflict-affected and fragile states.' A DfID guide says bidders must prove their expertise in public sector reform and be able to help with 'the effective functioning of the Cabinet and PM's/President's offices'. That remit may raise eyebrows given that Mr Blair was criticised for his record on public service reform and the way he ran No 10, making key decisions with informal 'sofa diplomacy' sessions with his cronies, rather than the Cabinet system. International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell last night confirmed that Mr Blair had applied to be considered for DfID cash. He said 'The Tony Blair Governance Initiative has applied . . . to be eligible to compete for a contract on public sector governance. 'Their bid will be treated like any other and judged on value for money and effectiveness. All DfID contracts operate under strict rules designed to get the best for British taxpayers and deliver help to the world's poorest people.' Mr Blair has entered a three-stage tendering process in which he must show he is fit to run a major overseas aid project with public money. If Mr Blair's bid is approved, he will then face separate 'mini competitions' for individual contracts. His overall finances are shrouded in mystery, but it is understood that until now his charitable activities  in the Third World have been funded mainly from his lucrative commercial activities. Adding Government money to this would represent a major expansion of his empire. Mr Blair is thought to have made about £25 million since leaving office, but the opaque way his finances are structured makes it almost impossible to establish the true size of his fortune. It is known that his property portfolio contains seven homes, worth £14 million. The Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative (AGI) is part of the Byzantine structure of companies, partnerships and consultancies constructed by the former PM. At the centre of the web is the Office of Tony Blair, based in Grosvenor Square, London, which co-ordinates all his activities. Aid to Sierra Leone is at the centre of concerns over a potential conflict of interest for Mr Blair . The office is funded by a structure called Windrush Ventures, into which much of his estimated £7 million-a-year income is funnelled. This income is derived from his commercial consultancy, Tony Blair Associates, the JP Morgan consultancy, another job with the Swiss insurer Zurich Financial Services and speaking engagements that can earn him six-figure payments. The AGI is registered as a charity, as is his Faith Foundation and Sports Foundation. However, last year the AGI was reprimanded by the Charities Commission for asking supporters to back Labour in the Election. The former PM divides his time between the charities and his diplomatic role as Middle East peace envoy for the 'Quartet' of the UN, Russia, America and the EU. Critics argue that much of his charitable work helps him to establish key political and commercial contacts around the world. Nick Thompson, the chief operating officer of AGI, previously headed the climate change unit at the Department for Business. Paul Skidmore, AGI's director of strategy and fundraising, is a former adviser to David Miliband; Andrew Ratcliffe, one of its project leaders, was in Mr Blair's Downing Street Strategy Unit, while Malte Gerhold, who is a project leader for AGI in Sierra Leone, worked in his Delivery Unit. Sierra Leone illustrates how Mr Blair could be open to claims that his business and governmental links could lead to a conflict of interest. The AGI is working to end the nation's dependence on aid, and has helped the government there to push through reforms, including fast-track commercial courts and easier financing from banks to small businesses. Meanwhile, JP Morgan has business interests in the country, including a stake in mining company Titanium Resources Group.

"By . John Hall . Fear: Jodie Marsh received up to five letters a week from stalker Joseph Mafwenke . A man who bombarded glamour model Jodie Marsh with letters and photographs of his penis faces prison after being found guilty of stalking. Joseph Mafwenke, 38, left Miss Marsh fearing for her life after sending hundreds of letters and photographs to her home address in Brentwood, Essex in an attempt to win her affection. Today a jury at Basildon Crown Court took just 30 minutes to find Mafwenke guilty of a stalking campaign that lasted from November 2012 until September last year. Mafwenke’s bizarre actions included sending Miss Marsh, 35, doctored images of the pair having sex and strolling hand in hand. During the trial Miss Marsh said she feared she could be kidnapped, raped or even murdered. That fear forced the glamour model turned bodybuilder to move out of her home in the hope of escaping Mafwenke's letters. Mafwenke was eventually arrested after Miss Marsh spotted him staring into a window at her old house when she arrived back in the neighbourhood to visit her family last September. Although that had not met at that point, Miss Marsh recognised Mafwenke from the photographs she had been sent. Mafwenke, of Crawley in West Sussex, denied the claims by arguing that an interview Miss Marsh gave to Zoo magazine suggested she wanted a boyfriend. He told the court: 'I wanted to try my chances with her.' In court Miss Marsh gave evidence from behind a screen so she would not have to face the defendant. At one point she broke down in tears when confronted with letters that had been sent to her home address. The letters initially arrived at a rate of once or twice a week, before increasing in volume to one a day. 'Straight away, I knew it was not normal fan mail, the letters would say things like 'you will be my wife', 'we will be together', 'you will have four children', 'we are meant to be together', Miss Marsh said. 'The way it was said, it was like it was a given that it would happen,' she added. Miss Marsh said the letters, which included pictures of a naked Mafwenke Photoshopped on top of her, left her 'really scared'. Scroll down for video . Miss Marsh said she 'feared for her life' when she received the letters - some of which had been photoshopped to show her having sex with Mafwenke. He also sent her pictures of his penis, jurors heard . The former glamour model, who is now a bodybuilder, said she initially told police not to take any action in case it 'tipped Mafwenke over the edge.' He would send up to five letters a week to Miss Marsh the court heard . 'He would send photos of himself, at first he was fully clothed then the photos turned explicit and he sent pictures of himself  naked and photos of his penis and erect penis,' she said. 'That was really upsetting. It was really disgusting - not something that I would want to see.' 'I was left nervous, thinking about what he might do in the future... I was worried that he was mentally unstable,' Miss Marsh added. She told the court she had initially asked police not to take any action in case it encouraged Mafwenke to escalate his stalking campaign. Miss Marsh in a 'no make-up selfie'. Mafwenke sent the bodybuilder letters saying he 'loved her' and 'wanted to have four children' with her . Miss Marsh pictured this month in a selfie with her pet pug. The court was told Mafwenke was inspired to send letters to the television personality after seeing her in a Zoo magazine article . - Jodie Marsh . Asked by the Crown what she feared could happen, Miss Marsh said: 'I thought it might be rape, murder, kidnap. In my line of work, you don’t think anything is too far-fetched.' The frequency of the letters then increased to up to five per week with the mail being sent by recorded delivery. One letter said: 'I love you and the way you are alone... I plan to have four babies with you in married life. Thank you for I make it happen.' 'Our time is now to have our childrens,' another read. The court heard Mafwenke also made . 'calculations' using his date of birth and Miss Marsh’s to work out . whether they would be happy together. When questioned in court Miss Marsh, pictured in training, said she never responded to any of the messages . Convicted: Mafwenke, who was arrested outside Miss Marsh's former home in Brentwood, was found guilty of stalking at Basildon Crown Court (pictured) Talking about the letters, Miss Marsh said: 'I honestly thought he was deluded. I did not think he was mentally stable.' Miss Marsh told the court she had never responded to the letters and only accepted recorded mail as much of the post she received for work was delivered that way. Mafwenke, who appeared in the dock wearing a blue and white striped shirt and black trousers alongside his Swahili interpreter, had pleaded not guilty to stalking Miss Marsh at an earlier hearing. He did not react as the guilty verdict was read out and was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing at Basildon Crown Court in May.","Joseph Mafwenke, 38, sent model Jodie Marsh, 35, explicit photographs .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A Little League coach in New York has spoken of how his family were terrorized by the mother of a little boy who failed to make the team. For nearly a year threatening letters were sent to John DeMasi and anonymous and unfounded claims of abuse where made against him. The family became so fearful of their stalker, who even wrote to their 10-year-old son, that Mr DeMasi's wife, Linda, was forced to give up work. Ordeal: Linda and John DeMasi were sent threatening letters for nearly a year . Arrest: Janet Chiauzzi was found guilty of stalking after police matched her handwriting to the handwritten addresses on the envelopes . In a chilling twist, the person responsible for the letters turned out to be neighbor Janet Chiauzzi, who the family had considered a friend. She was caught when Mr DeMasi's wife, Linda, asked the 44-year-old to sign up for a fundraiser, and recognized the woman's distinctive handwriting. Charges: Chiauzzi was found guilty of stalking in May 2012, and was sentenced to 60 days' prison . 'The way she wrote ""East Meadow"", it was . a certain way,' Mrs DeMasi told ABC's 20/20. 'I could feel my knees starting . to shake as I was standing there, and I couldn't believe it.' Chiauzzi was sentenced to 60 days in prison and five years' probation when she was sentenced in May 2012 on charges of stalking. She began her hate campaign when her son failed to make it on to the summer travel team. Although the case was nearly two years ago, the DeMasi family remain haunted by the letters and threats made against them. Their ordeal is documented in an episode of 20/20, due to be broadcast tonight. The first letters started to arrive in the summer of 2010, accusing Mr DeMasi of using his position as coach to get his son Dominic on the team. Soon other letters arrived, but this time, instead of complaining about the team and his coaching abilities, the letters included personal information about the family. 'I know where your wife goes every day. I know where your daughter goes to dance school,'  Mrs DeMasi said one of the letters claimed. Concerned for her safety, Mrs DeMasi felt unable to work, and had to give up her part-time job so she could stay as near to her children as possible. 'I didn't feel safe with somebody else driving my children. I was afraid,' she said. In early 2011, the letter-writer also targeted the couple's son, Dominic. The note arrived on the same day as one addressed to his father, and it said: 'If your father doesn't step back, I'm going to kill him.' The second letter, addressed to Mr DeMasi, said: 'I made it my life's goal now to observe . your family on a 24/7 basis ... Just tell your wife and kids to watch . themselves, especially at night.' Shortly afterwards, Nassau County Child Protective Services interviewed the couple's children after receiving an anonymous letter claiming their father beat them - allegations completely unfounded. The threats affected everyone in the family, including Dominic, who was only 10 at the time. 'Every time I . went up to bat, I felt someone was always watching me. It definitely . made the game more nerve-wrecking and harder to deal with,' he told 20/20. Targeted: The DeMasi's son, Dominic, also received letters threatening that harm would come to his family if they didn't cut their ties to the Little League team . The letter that had been addressed to him had read: 'Tell your stupid father to back away from the travel team and East Meadow Baseball or he will be sorry ... accidents do happen and I'm sure you don't want to see your family get hurt.' During the terrifying ordeal, Chiauzzi, who the family considered a friend, was regularly texting Mrs DeMasi and even came to her 40th birthday party. But police, who believed the letters to the family, and the one to the school, were coming from the same source, began to suspect the new friend wasn't all that she seemed. The same handwriting and stamps appeared on all the envelopes, and police believed the letter writer was someone who had intimate knowledge of the family. To get proof, Mrs DeMasi pretended to be collecting addresses for a fundraising event, to get Chiauzzi to provide a handwriting sample. She immediately recognized the writing, and police spent 48 hours analyzing the sample with the letters, before finally arresting Chiauzzi in June 2011. The woman's attorney told 20/20 that Chiauzzi, who was found guilty of stalking, was 'genuinely remorseful'. 'She was willing to accept responsibility for her actions rather than exercise her right to go to trial,' the attorney added.","John DeMasi and his 10-year-old son were sent letters threatening harm if they didn't quit team .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A family were left devastated when their new puppy was taken from them and placed into quarantine after he was discovered to be an illegal immigrant with a fake passport. Little Milo had only been living with the Donkin family for three weeks when trading standards officers arrived to take him away. The five-month-old white Maltese Terrier was one of ten puppies imported illegally from Holland. Little Milo (pictured with owner Eleanor Donkin) had only been living with his new family for three weeks when trading standards arrived to take him away . The five-month-old white Maltese Terrier was one of ten puppies imported illegally from Holland . During a trip to the vets, Eleanor was told Milo hadn't had the right injections and that his passport looked false . The family had no idea there was anything wrong until they took the dog for a routine check-up and a vet noticed his passport looked false. Trading Standards officers were contacted and Milo was taken into quarantine, much to the despair of Eleanor, 16, who had convinced her mother Carolyn, 48, to buy the dog. Eleanor, from Hexham, Northumberland, said: 'I didn't think we would be coming home with a puppy but as soon as I saw him my heart melted. 'We'd spotted him for sale online and met up with the seller to have a tentative look. 'He was the last boy puppy left, and as soon as I saw him I knew I had to have him. 'We had no idea that there was anything wrong with Milo. He was such a loveable perfect puppy and I was so happy to have him in my life.' Milo was taken into quarantine after trading standards had been contacted, much to the despair of Eleanor who had convinced her mother Carolyn to buy the dog . Three weeks after Milo was taken, he was reunited with his family with all his jabs up-to-date . But sadly his brother and sister were not so lucky and had to be put down . 'I couldn't imagine life without my little ball of fur': Eleanor's family were forced to spend nearly £500 on Milo's quarantine after it was discovered that he had been illegally smuggled into the country from the Netherlands . Milo and his siblings were sold by John Graham, a furniture salesman from Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, who brought them to England without their rabies injections, selling them off to unsuspecting families across the North East . During a trip to the veterinary . surgery, Eleanor was told Milo hadn't had the right injections and that . his passport looked false.. She was told to contact trading standards, who then ordered the dog to be quarantined costing £490. She said: 'I didn't consider for a second that it was anything wrong with him. They said he might have to be put down. 'I didn't want anyone to take Milo away from me but I knew I had to protect mum and I too. 'The day that trading standards came to take him away I made the man promise that I would get him back,' she added. Milo jumps for joy . Pet owners bringing their dog, cat or ferret into the UK are able to do so without placing it in quarantine so long as they meet the rules of the Pet Travel Scheme. This requires pets travelling in to or returning to the UK from an EU or non-EU listed country to have a microchip, a rabies vaccination, a pet passport or official third country veteninary certificate and tapeworm treatment (for dogs only). The owner must also be an authorised carrier and on an approved route. Those travelling from an 'unlisted' country however must ensure their pet has a microchip, a rabies vaccination, a blood test, an official third country veterinary certificate and tapeworm treatment (for dogs only). Again, those transporting the pet must be an authorised carrier and taking an approved route. Puppy smuggler Graham pleaded guilty at Bedlington Magistrates' Court to importing puppies into the UK from Holland in breach of the Rabies Order 1974 . The puppies were sold by John Graham, a furniture salesman from Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, who brought them to England without their rabies injections, selling them off to unsuspecting families across the North East region. Graham pleaded guilty at Bedlington Magistrates' Court to importing puppies into the UK from Holland in breach of the Rabies Order 1974. Three weeks after Milo was taken, he was reunited with his family with all his jabs up-to-date. However, his brother and sister weren't so lucky and had to be put down.

"By . Amy Willis . and Leon Watson . and Michael Seamark . Personal messages left by Prince William for his ‘babykins’ Kate Middleton were hacked by the News of the World, a court heard yesterday. In one voicemail the Duke of Cambridge, who was at Sandhurst military academy at the time, told his future wife he was nearly shot while on an Army training exercise. Prince Harry’s voicemail was also intercepted, the phone-hacking trial was told. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pictured yesterday visiting Only Connect, . a charity supporting ex-offenders and young people at risk of . offending, in King's Cross, London. The Old Bailey heard intimate messages from William to Kate were intercepted in 2006 . The Duchess and Prince William together on the day of their graduation ceremony at St Andrew's University while they were dating . A joke message apparently left by . William in which he called his younger brother ‘ginger’, put on a . high-pitched voice and pretended to be Harry’s then-girlfriend Chelsy . Davy was hacked. Prosecutor . Andrew Edis QC read the Old Bailey transcripts of the voice recordings – . made in 2006 – which were discovered by detectives investigating . hacking allegations. In one, William started by saying: ‘Hi baby’, . adding: ‘Had a busy day today again. The Duchess as she left Younger Hall after her graduation ceremony in June, 2005 . ‘I’ve . been running around the woods of Aldershot chasing shadows and getting . terribly lost, and I walked into some other regiment’s ambush, which was . slightly embarrassing because I nearly got shot. Not by live rounds but . by blank rounds, which would be very embarrassing though. ‘Um, . er, yeah, I’m off on exercise tomorrow morning, just for the day, and . then I’m back on Saturday first thing, erm, so I probably won’t be able . to speak to you tomorrow night.’ He . then told her he might send her ‘a cheeky text message’ because he . might have his phone with him, before signing off: ‘All right, baby, . lots of love, um, speak to you soon. Bye bye.’ Among . the details of voicemails discovered by detectives at the home of . private investigator Glenn Mulcaire was another call from William in . which he said: ‘My head’s all right. I’ve just picked up your message. Oh, my little babykins! I hope you are all right. ‘I . just tried ringing you but I do not think you would pick it up because . it is 5.35am in the morning so it is probably not a very good time to . ring you. I hope you are all right.’ In . another message William says: ‘Hello baby, it’s me. Sorry I did not . ring you earlier and tell you what I was doing. Been a bit of a . nightmare day. I think I would just about be finished in a minute. ‘It . has just gone six but I don’t think I will be able to leave here till . about seven. I have got stuff here to do, bits and pieces, but I should . be able to leave at about seven at the least. Crack on with what you . have got to do and don’t worry about me. I will give you a buzz later. News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman claimed Prince William was booted out of an Army party for ‘braying Hooray Henry’ antics in front of horrified guests, the court heard. He emailed the paper’s deputy editor Neil Wallis in 2006 with an account of Prince Harry’s passing out party at Sandhurst. Goodman also said Kate Middleton shunned the party and did not get on with Harry’s then-girlfriend Chelsy Davy. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC introduced the email alongside a hacked message recovered by police from royal aide Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton left by Sandhurst commandant Major General Andrew Ritchie referring to an ‘incident at the ball’. A story containing large parts of Goodman’s claims appeared on April 16, 2006, under the headline ‘So silly Willy’, the court heard. Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson .

Lots of . love and I’ll speak to you later.’ Clive Goodman exposed a joke by Prince William after hacking into Prince Harry's voicemail messages, the court heard. The jury were read a transcript of a tape recovered in 2006 apparently left on Prince Harry's phone pretending to be girlfriend Chelsy Davy (pictured together above). In it, he was dubbed a 'big, hairy fat ginger', and told 'you really are quite ugly for a ginger', the court heard. The jokey message, delivered in a high pitched voice with a South African accent, was attributed to Prince William in one of Goodman's stories printed on April 9,, 2006 . The message said: 'Hi its Chelsy here, I just want to say I miss you so much, and I think you're the most - best looking ginger I've ever seen. 'Although you really are quite ugly for a ginger, I hope you're having a lovely time, I really miss you. 'It's lovely out here in Africa and hopefully I'll see you very soon, you big hairy fat ginger, anyway, speak to you later.' In . one call, William talks of wanting to go on a drag hunt with beagles: . ‘Hi honey, it’s me. I’m back in the small land of Sandhurst. A couple of . pretty nasty days on exercise. Decided to just enjoy them. I am feeling . a bit s***** at the moment but hope you are OK. Lovely to speak to . you... ‘You are probably . very busy working but if there is any chance you are free, maybe later . this afternoon or evening, I might be able to get out. I am going to try . and go out beagling again and then come to you afterwards. ‘So . if you are around at home this evening I would love to see you. Let me . know. Give me a text or ring back. I am around about the rest of the . day.’ The prosecuting . lawyer then read excerpts from the voicemail which it is claimed was . left by William for Harry, quoting from it: ‘Hi its Chelsy here, I just . want to say I miss you so much, and I think you’re the most – best . looking ginger I’ve ever seen. ‘Although . you really are quite ugly for a ginger, I hope you’re having a lovely . time, I really miss you. It’s lovely out here in Africa and hopefully . I’ll see you very soon, you big hairy fat ginger, anyway, speak to you . later.’ In January 2006 a . story appeared in the News of the World headlined ‘William shot in . ambush’. The court heard the ‘babykins’ nickname appeared in an . exclusive by Clive Goodman on February 12, 2006 which said: ‘Wills wants . the girl he calls “babykins” to be his princess.’ William . and Kate, who met at St Andrews University in 2001, were first . romantically linked in 2004. They split briefly in 2007 but were engaged . in 2010 and married the following year. Former . News of the World managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, and former editor . Andy Coulson are accused of conspiring to hack phones between October . 3, 2000, and August 9, 2006, along with former News International chief . executive Rebekah Brooks. Mrs . Brooks faces two counts of conspiring with others to commit misconduct . in public office linked to alleged inappropriate payments to public . officials. She also faces . two allegations of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice: one with . her former personal assistant Cheryl Carter and a second with her . husband, Charles Brooks, and former News International head of security . Mark Hanna and others. Mr . Coulson faces two allegations that he conspired with former NOTW royal . editor Goodman, 56, and others to commit misconduct in public office. The defendants deny all charges. The trial continues. Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks faces a series of charges linked to the phone hacking of celebrities and others . Rebekah Brooks 'categorically' denies making a corrupt payment to a serving member of the armed forces or the Ministry of Defence or to a serving police officer, an Old Bailey jury has heard. The former editor of the News of the World and the Sun newspapers made the flat-out denials in 2012 while being interviewed by police officers who were investigating claims that telephones had been hacked. She was responding to questions about how she ran the top-selling tabloids while she was in charge. The written statements she prepared to rebut the allegations were read out to the jury. In the statement she made on March 21 2012, Brooks told detectives: 'I categorically deny the allegation that you have put to me that I was involved in a conspiracy to make corrupt payments to the serving member of the armed forces, or the employee of the MoD.' In another denial she made during a police interview on October 4 2012, Brooks said: 'I have chosen to answer the allegations that you have put to me today by means of a statement. I have never knowingly authorised a corrupt payment to a serving police officer. 'I have never had a serving police officer as a paid source as editor of the Sun and the News of the World. I never sanctioned either explicitly or implicitly corrupt payments to serving police officers.'

"By . Hannah Roberts . Silvio Berlusconi paid underage exotic dancer Ruby-the-Heart-stealer five million Euros to commit perjury at his sex trial, prosecutors believe. The former Italian premier was last year convicted of paying for sex with Ruby, real name Karima el Mahroug when she was just 17, during notorious burlesque orgies at his mansion. It is illegal to have sex with a prostitute under the age of 18 in Italy. An entire troupe of ‘bunga bunga’ girls are also accused of perjury in the Milan prosecutor’s probe into an alleged attempt to pervert the course of justice during the trial. Money talks: Prosecutors believe Karima 'Ruby' el Mahrough was promised €5million by Silvio Berlusconi to keep quiet during his trial . Underage sex: Silvio Berlusconi was convicted of paying for sex with Ruby, real name Karima el Mahroug when she was just 17, at trial last year . In court seven of the showgirls and starlets admitted receiving a salary of €2,500 a month, but prosecutors now believe as many as 30 received payments. Some were also living rent-free in apartments on Berlusconi’s vast property development adjacent to Milan, Milan 2. Berlusconi has always said that he maintained them because ‘their lives were ruined by the trial’. Forty five people are named in the prosecutor's investigation into judicial corruption, including Berlusconi’s two lawyers, an aged pop star and a journalist on Berlusconi's Mediaset channels, who allegedly received payments totalling €800,000 from the former premier, as well as several cars. Giorgia Iafrate, the policewoman who authorised Ruby’s release from jail, because Berlusconi claimed she was the niece of former Egyptian despot Hosni Mubarak, is also named in the writ. Tapped: Karima 'Ruby the Heart Stealer' El Mahrough told a friend that she was expecting ¿5million from Berlusconi . A Milan-based group of bunga bunga girls were allegedly summoned to Berlusconi’s mansion on the night of January 15, 2011 to finalise the defensive strategy. ‘Ruby in particular was promised a huge reward if she kept quiet and if not Berlusconi would go ballistic, judicial sources told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. The former nightclub dancer later told a friend that she was expecting €5million from Berlusconi, police phone taps have revealed. Prosecutor Edmondo Bruti Liberati of the Court of Milan confirmed the probe and said that his investigations were ongoing. Disgraced politician: Prosecutors have indicted an entire troupe of ¿bunga bunga¿ girls in an alleged attempt to pervert the course of justice during Berlusconi's trial . Berlusconi denies the allegations and vowed today to remain in politics ‘until the end.’ He said: 'I feel the responsibility of the trust given to me and of the votes of the public. 'I will stay in the field, more convinced than ever that I have to fight till the end to see what I deeply believe in prevail.' The media mogul is currently appealing his seven year sentence in the Ruby trial and faces a court ruling in April on his one year sentence for tax fraud. Berlusconi has applied to serve his sentence performing community service but could ace house arrest which would hinder his party’s chances in the May European elections.","Silvio Berlusconi paid for sex with Ruby when she was just 17 .

"By . Sara Malm . and Daily Mail Reporter . The base jumpers who filmed as they leaped off One World Trade Center in a daredevil stunt have said they didn't mean to be disrespectful. James Brady and Andrew Rossig, who leaped off the 104th floor of Freedom Tower with their friend, Marko Markovich, in September, said the jump was supposed to be a private moment. But, after handing themselves into police Monday, the friends uploaded footage of the jump, made at 3am on September 30, last year. The video has quickly gone viral, with more than 200,000 views in just over one day. Scroll down for video . Captured: Police allegedly seized the GoPro video of the BASE jump during a search of the four men's home last month, and it was not posted online until yesterday . Spreading fast: The five-minute video was uploaded to YouTube on Monday and quickly went viral . Stunning views: Manhattan is lit up below the men as they parachute across the city . Their actions were condemned by the Port Authority and New York Police Department, which said the jump 'violated the spirit of respect and reverence for this sacred site that almost all connected with the WTC project feel'. In an interview on GMA this morning however, Brady, who worked on a construction team building the tower, and Rossig, said they were just thrill seekers who had meant no harm. 'Everybody has their thing. This is our thing ... we were thinking that very clearly that everything was working out for us to make a clean safe jump,' Brady, 32, said. Rossig added: 'We had no intention of being disrespectful,' as the friends explained how they had found a blind spot in the site's security camera coverage, and a hole in the fence, that let them slip in unnoticed. The 33-year-old added that it was supposed to have been a 'peaceful, quiet moment' and said he was surprised that police came looking for them six months after the jump. 'We were a little bit shocked that they spent that much time and energy continuing to pursue something that they knew was not a terroristic act,' he said. 'Our intent was never for this to go public. We never posted the video footage. People didn’t know about it. We kept things quiet. As far as we were concerned, no one ever needed to know,' he added. Confessed: James Brady, left, and Andrew Rossig, right, are accompanied by attorney Timothy Parlatore as they turn themselves in to police on Monday . Defense: Brady, left, and Rossig, right, appeared on GMA to reveal why they decided to leap off the building . Police had tracked the group down . using surveillance footage from the area they landed in. 'Just a little . snippet of video that we had of someone landing on the West Side Highway . with a parachute around 4am. That’s all we had to work with initially,' Commissioner William Bratton said. The . five-minute clip filmed by one of the base jumpers was posted on Monday . as the three jumpers; Brady, Rossig, and Markovich, 27, and their . alleged lookout, Kyle Hartwell, 29, . all from New York, handed themselves in to NYPD. According . to Rossig's attorney, the film was seized by police last month after a . search of the men's homes, but has only now been posted online. All proceeds made from advertisement revenue will be donated to charity, the group has said. The four, who pleaded not guilty, face charges of burglary and trespassing as well as misdemeanor . reckless endangerment and misdemeanor jumping from a structure. They have been released on $3,500 bail. ‘It's a fair . amount of free-fall time,’ he said. ‘You really get to enjoy the view of . the city and see it from a different perspective.’ Rossig, . an avid BASE jumper said the skydivers took care to keep from endangering anyone, . choosing a time when streets would be largely deserted. Going down: The initial free-fall from the 1,776ft tall One World Trade Center tower is several hundred feet . Good cause: All proceeds made from the video will be donated to charity, the group has said . City that never sleeps: One of the jumpers descends on the streets of New York City . While a majority of YouTube users are . applauding the group's daring jump, some criticised their choice of . doing so just weeks after the anniversary of 9/11. Ted . Morris wrote 'Does any one see the irony of this guys JUMPING from 1 . world trade? kind of eerie, being that about 13 years ago hundreds were . doing it... to their deaths.

"By . Dan Bloom . Animal cruelty: Khalid Undre's restaurant boasted green credentials, but he was convicted of failures in rearing cows on his own smallholidng . The owner of an upmarket vegetarian restaurant has been accused of 'appalling animal cruelty' after he some of his cows died by the leader of Harrow Council. Khalid Undre failed to give enough food and water to a 20-strong herd of Red Poll cattle on his smallholding in the middle of winter. RSPCA inspectors were tipped off and found one cow dead in heavy snow alongside its calf. Another died after giving birth, though its calf survived and now lives on a petting farm in Sussex. The other cattle were underweight and dehydrated after being left exposed in sub-zero conditions without enough food or water. The shocking case came despite Undre's restaurant Down to Earth, in west London's Kensington High Street, boasting of its 'environmentally sound, sustainable and animal friendly' credentials. Located in one of London's wealthiest areas and including a cafe and shop, it sold dishes like organic scrambled eggs with herb-sauteed mushrooms for £7.50 and a 'raw food' vegan terrine for £8.50. Other animal-friendly dishes included a Shepherd's pie made from lentils and a burger made from mixed nuts and vegetables. The restaurant's website even claimed that 'by-products from our kitchen go to feed the cows in our Harrow farm.' It added: 'Our organic food is produced using the purest methods; no synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers, radiation, industrial solvents or chemical food additives allowed. 'By its nature environmentally sound, sustainable and animal friendly, we work hard to ensure that the organic produce we offer always meets the highest of standards: Our own.' Willesden Magistrates' Court heard RSPCA officers visited the smallholding in Harrow, north London, last January after a tip-off from a worried member of the public. He denied five charges of animal mistreatment but was found guilty after a trial. After the investigation the dehydrated herd was then sold to another farmer. Some calves which had been born at the site were left untagged contrary to the law, and were slaughtered at Undre’s request, the court heard. Upmarket: The restaurant (pictured) is in Kensington High Street, one of London's wealthiest areas . The surviving cows were found dehydrated and underweight, the court heard. Undre denied five charges of animal cruelty but was found guilty, handed 120 hours' community service and made to pay £2,500 . Undre, 50, from Kenton, north London, was sentenced to 120 hours of community work and ordered to pay £2,500 towards prosecution costs. He was found guilty on five counts: failing to feed his cows a wholesome diet, failing to feed them at regular intervals, failing to provide adequate access to drinking water, failing to tag four calves and failing to dispose of a carcass. Harrow Council leader Susan Hall said: 'This was an appalling offence of animal cruelty, made all the more grotesque by the cynical way in which this man paraded himself as a champion of ethical food standards. 'Our officers work extremely hard to prosecute these complex cases, and it is down to their hard work that these animals’ suffering is over, and their owner brought to justice.' MailOnline was unable to reach Undre immediately. However, he told the Evening Standard he intended to appeal against his conviction.","Khalid Undre failed to give adequate food and water to 20 cows on his smallholding .

That was the excuse CNN producer Yon Promrenze, 35, and his 26-year-old cameraman Connor Boals gave police officers before they were arrested for trying to break into the World Trade Center Tuesday. The two men first tried blatantly walking through a security gate on Vesey and Washington Streets but were stopped by an officer, Port Authoruty spokesman Steve Coleman said. 'If a 16-year-old can get on the site, we should be able to get in as well,' one of them allegedly told the officer. Scroll down for video .

Sneaky: Weehawken, New Jersey teen Justin Casquejo, 16, was arrested after successfully making it to the top of One World Trade Center in the middle of the night on March 16 . They were referring to 16-year-old Weehawken, New Jersey student Justin Casquejo who was arrested last week after successfully making it past security and to the top of the Freedom Tower in the middle of the night. They then headed east toward the New Jersey Path Station and Boals twice tried to climb the fence but were again stopped by security. It was on their third attempt to push through a gate at Vesey and Church streets in front of a security guard that the CNN journalists were finally arrested. 'They were trying to prove a point. I guess they thought anybody could get in,' a law enforcement source told the New York Post. The two men were arrested, booked and charged with trespassing, obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct. Port Authority spokesman Joseph Pentangelo told the New York Daily News that the journalists' arrests was 'an incredible waste of police resources'. According to their LinkedIn profiles, Pomrenze has been at CNN since March 2012 while Boals has worked at the news network since January. Boals is a graduate of the Columbia Journalism School.

'They were in the surrounding area to do a story about the recent incidents at the WTC and other sites – and the notion that daredevils are being drawn to them.'

A secondary school has installed a dog in the classroom to help young children read. Flossie, a 15-week-old Cockapoo, has quickly become a hit in the classroom after being brought in by bosses at Hylands School in Chelmsford, Essex. She is pictured here with Year 7 students (left to right) Bradley Day, Jake Gurton, Leia Osborne, Charlie Goody and Caitlin Clark. Flossie, a ten-month-old Cockapoo, was brought after studies revealed children feel more comfortable reading to pets because they are not judgemental like adults if they make a mistake. The cocker spaniel/poodle cross has become a huge hit at Hylands School in Chelmsford, Essex, and teachers say they have already seen a marked improvement in literacy. Her influence doesn't end there - foreign language classes are more fun now that dog commands in French and Spanish are on the syllabus. Flossie is also helping children with road safety skills during walkies with staff and pupils. And her calm nature is being used to help children overcome their fear of animals. Jacob Wicks, 11, who joined the school in September - the same time as the dog - said: 'I think Flossie is cute, soft and lovely. 'Reading to her could help as dogs can't make bad comments like people can.' Flossie was brought after studies revealed children feel more comfortable reading to pets .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Troubled: James Hammonds died after jumping from a bridge in Bristol in June last year . A teenager battling a shopping addiction committed suicide after stealing thousands of pounds from his mother to feed his compulsion, an inquest has heard. James Hammonds struggled with depression and obsessions since the death of his father in 2008. The 19-year-old leapt to his death from a bridge after a night out with friends in Bristol on June 29 last year. An inquest heard the shop assistant indulged in a 10-week spree, secretly transferring £7,780 from his mother Elizabeth Hammonds' bank account, to buy clothes online and to fund nights out. But when his mother confronted him, demanding he get help, Mr Hammonds threatened to kill himself. Days later Ms Hammond reported her son missing. His body was discovered on July 4. Ms Hammonds told the inquest: 'It was when he was at college I noticed James was depressed. 'He was struggling to get out of bed. He displayed obsessive behaviour - cleaning and often throwing things away having recently bought them. 'The £6,000 he got in inheritance, he just blew the lot. He had a shopping addiction and this was where a large sum of money was spent. 'I was shocked [when I realised he had taken the money] and I thought it was his compulsive shopping disorder.' Ms Hammonds, from Eastville in Bristol, said she discovered her son had been stealing money since April 2013, when he was on holiday in Magaluf, Spain last June. The day after he returned she confronted him, telling the teenager if he did not get help she would go to the police. Mr Hammonds, who lived with his mother, confessed that he was 'seriously depressed' and thinking about killing himself, prompting Ms Hammonds to call the family GP. Obsessive: The 19-year-old shop assistant had battled depression and obsessions including an addiction to shopping since his father died in 2008 of a blood clot . James Hammonds' family today paid tribute to the 'intelligent and much-loved' teenager. They said his shopping addiction was a 'serious problem' but they had no idea how much he had spent on designer clothes and trainers. Speaking at the family home yesterday, his mother's partner Jason Sparkes, 43, said: 'He was much loved and respected by his family and friends. 'He was depressed and what he did was totally out of character. 'He was well liked by everyone who knew him and his colleagues at Ikea presented a lovely book of condolence about him. Nearly everyone commented on his great sense of humour. 'He was just a typical 19-year-old boy.' Speaking about his compulsive shopping, Mr Sparkes added: 'I don't know how common it is but it was a compulsion for internet shopping and he did have a real problem. It had gone quite far. 'It was mostly clothes and trainers - he liked to look good. 'It is not a well documented symptom of depression but it is probably more common than people think because of the ease with which people can just order things from the internet.' He said James was much-missed by his two older half-sisters from his father's previous marriage and his three nieces and his nephew. Dr Loveday concluded he was 'acutely suicidal' and asked Bristol Intensive Team to visit him within four hours. But the mental health workers were content to speak to the 19-year-old and his mother on the phone and arrange future meetings. He was prescribed antidepressants and referred a number of emergency mental health workers, including nurse Ciaran Purceil. Mr Purceil said the teen's money worries were a primary contributor to his low mood - along with the problematic relationship with his mum and the death of his father Peter from a blood clot in 2008. He told the inquest: 'I referred to his response to difficult situations, for example having to repay the significant sum of money. 'In that situation his initial response had been the only way out of this would be ending my life. 'I would say it was one of the key concerns.' On the night of his death Mr Hammonds had been out in Bristol with friends Sunil Pandya and Charlie Cooper. The trio parted ways at around 2am on June 29. CCTV caught Mr Hammonds stumbling close to a bridge before he jumped half an hour after leaving his friends. His mother - who had been working a night shift - was woken at 1pm the next day by friends worried about messages her son had posted on Facebook. Ms Hammonds told the inquest: 'They were words to the effect of ""I don't want anyone to feel responsible for what I have done"" and ""I just want to go to sleep for a long time"".' Ms Hammonds reported her son missing and his body was discovered on July 4. Coroner Dr Peter Harrowing recorded a verdict of death by suicide due to multiple injuries. He said: 'I put it to Dr Sterling [a senior mental health nurse] there were a number of stresses in his life. 'She identified particularly her concerns of his use of alcohol and the - I think significant - issue in relation to the loss of money from his mother's account. 'I consider that loss of money played a significant impact on him. The express concern of how that money was to be repaid.' He added: 'I consider that James did take a deliberate act. 'I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that James knew what he was doing and understood the action he took and moreover knew the consequences of this action would be his death.' During the inquest James' family questioned the number of different health workers he saw - at least four different people - and a confusion over who his key worker was. They also criticised the fact James was assessed on the phone by the mental health team despite the fact his doctor had requested a visit within four hours. They suggested a system should be put in place to check patients have enrolled on the voluntary help programmes. But Dr Harrowing said the phone call assessment was 'appropriate in this case' and that James' care was 'not compromised as a consequence' of the confusion over his key worker. His half-sister Jenny Hammonds said her brother had first been prescribed anti-depressants some months prior to his death, but had stopped taking his medication without seeking medical advice. She said: 'James went on to antidepressants after self-harming and having suicidal thoughts he thought he could cope without them and said they made him feel numb. 'He only told us this when he reached crisis point, we did not know he had come off his medication at the time. 'James was very good at hiding his feelings and wanted to appear as if everything was okay. He came off them in April without a doctors advice. 'He then had a relapse of his depression and this was a major contributing factor to his suicide. He started the antidepressants again a week before the suicide, this can heighten your energy for a short period and the risk of suicide can increase before the antidepressants really start working. 'I think it's important to raise awareness of these issues in order to help others in James's position. You shouldn't come off antidepressants abruptly without medical opinion, it can cause a severe relapse. 'James had been suffering from depression for a long time and this was the real issue, the spending addiction was just a symptom of this, . 'James was the loveliest, kindest, most gentle and caring person you could ever wish to meet and I wish I had known how to help him.'

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Eight million people in the UK are at high risk of heart disease and diabetes even though they have a 'healthy' body mass index (BMI), experts have said. People of African, Caribbean and Asian descent are up to six times more likely to suffer from type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke. This is according to the National Institute for Health and Care . Excellence (NICE), in a briefing to the local authorities that . plan health campaigns. People of African, Caribbean and Asian descent are up to six times more likely to suffer from type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke - and a BMI of 23 should ring alarm bells, experts say . It said a lower BMI of 23 - typically . classed as in the 'healthy' range of 18 to 25 - must be used as a . trigger for action in helping those from these backgrounds avoid ill . health. Professor Mike Kelly, director of the centre for public health at Nice, said: 'Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke are potentially life-threatening conditions, which people of African, Caribbean and Asian descent and other minority ethnicities are significantly more likely to develop than the wider population. The most widely used way to measure an adult's weight is to calculate body mass index (BMI). This is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in metres squared. A 'healthy' BMI is classed as between 18 and 25. If your BMI is between 25 and 29.9, you are over the ideal weight for your height (overweight). If your BMI is between 30 and 39.9, you are obese. If your BMI is over 40, you are very obese (known as ‘morbidly obese’). 'So it's vital that local authorities are supported in taking action to prevent these illnesses in people who have a high risk of developing them. 'Not only are people from these ethnic backgrounds up to six times more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, they are 50% more likely to die from cardiovascular disease, and they also suffer from these conditions at a younger age. 'This briefing recommends that a BMI of 23 should be the threshold to trigger action to prevent these chronic conditions in people of African, Caribbean and Asian descent and other minority ethnicities, as these individuals are at an increased risk at what is normally considered a healthy weight. 'In our diverse population, it's essential that decision makers, practitioners and individuals are aware of this difference, as it's lower than the 25 BMI value routinely used to signal an increased risk of chronic illness.' Critics have previously argued that Body Mass Index is an insensitive measure of obesity, prone to underestimating obesity in women in particular. Critics have previously argued that Body Mass Index is an insensitive measure of obesity, prone to underestimating obesity in women in particular . Two years ago Dr Eric Braverman, of . Weill Cornell Medical School, and Dr Nirav Shah, the New York state . health commissioner, found that BMI drastically underestimated how many . people should regard themselves as unhealthily overweight or obese. In addition, the likelihood of error increased as they got older. Fifty-nine per cent more women aged 70 or over were classified as obese when measured with a DXA scan than their BMI suggested. Researchers said this was because women lost more muscle to fat than men as they age. As BMI does not distinguish between muscle and fat, it doesn’t pick up on the change, Dr Braverman said. He added that BMI should be called the ‘baloney mass index’ because it was so inaccurate.","People of African, Caribbean and Asian .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Ryan Gorman . A 16-year-old boy bypassed security and climbed to the top of 1 World Trade Center, the nation's tallest building, to take pictures in the middle of the night, police said Thursday. Justin Casquejo, of nearby Weehakwen, New Jersey, was arrested at 6 a.m. Sunday and charged with misdemeanor criminal trespass, said Joe Pentangelo, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site. The teen accessed the construction site of the nearly completed tower by slipping through a 1-foot opening in a fence at around 4.00 a.m., Pentangelo said. He then allegedly entered the tower by climbing scaffolding. Daredevil: Justin Casquejo, 16, sneaked into the WTC site and spent almost two hours on the roof of the nearly completed Freedom Tower, he is pictured at right on top of a construction crane in nearby Hoboken . Fascinated: Casquejo has long been obsessed with the WTC's Freedom Tower, according to the Post . 'He’s a skinny kid who got through a skinny hole,' a police source told the New York Post. Casquejo is said to have taken an elevator up to the 88th floor despite not having any identification, according to the paper. He was let off at the 88th floor and hoofed it up to the 104th floor where he sneaked past a sleeping guard to access the roof. That guard has since been fired, the spokesman said, but the elevator operator was ab;e to keep his job because he is in a union. Casquejo scaled equipment on the roof to reach the 1,776-foot tall Freedom Tower's antenna. The daredevil spent two hours perched atop the city before trying to sneak his way out as the sun came up. 'He came here and he ran hog wild,' a site worker told the Post. Thrillseeker: Casquejo, pictured on a construction crane in Hoboken, appears to love sneaking into tall buildings under construction . Accused: Casquejo faces a criminal trespass charge for his WTC stunt, but appears to have gotten away with climbing a construction crane in Hoboken (right) Boisterous: Casquejo was much more talkative on Twitter than when reached by the Post . Port Authority police arrested him on the premises. His camera and cellphone were seized after authorities obtained a search warrant. Officials are still trying to piece together exactly how he was able to elude security measures implemented by agencies including the New York Police Department, Port Authority Police and private security firms. 'I walked around the construction site and figured out how to access the Freedom Tower rooftop,' Casquejo said in court, according to documents cited by the paper. The investigation was continuing into whether the teen may have entered other parts of the building. He later tweeted the word 'inspired,' in reference to his now-infamous climb to the top of one of the tallest buildings in the world. He wasn't nearly as talkative when reached by the post. 'Ha ha, oh yeah, that. Right. I would really love to talk to you guys because I have a lot that I want to say about it,' said the teen. 'I was told that I just can’t [talk] without permission.' 'We take security and these types of infractions very seriously and will prosecute violators,' Joe Dunne, chief security officer for the Port Authority, said in a statement. 'We continue to reassess our security posture at the site and are constantly working to make this site as secure as possible.'","Justin Casquejo, 16, was charged Sunday with criminal trespass for sneaking into the World Trade Center .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A five-year-old boy has been accused of deliberately starting a fire in a Pennsylvania house on Sunday night that killed his young cousin. The victim of the fire, two-year-old Ayanna Lisa Brooks, died of smoke inhalation as she tried to hide from the flames that quickly engulfed the McKeesport home she lived in. Her cousin, who has a history of starting fires, is believed to have used a lighter to start the blaze which destroyed three homes, and seriously damaged a fourth. Inferno: The blaze quickly took hold in the rented house on Sunday night . Victim: Ayanna Lisa Brooks was found in an upstairs bedroom, where police believe she was trying to hide . The cousins were living at the rented home, which was shared by their mothers and five children. At the time of the fire Ayanna's mother was in Florida with another child. Three children were able to escape from the blaze at about 11.30pm on Sunday, but Ayanna was found trapped in an upstairs bedroom. A medical examiner found that she had died from smoke inhalation. 'She didnâ€™t die in the fire. The child was probably hiding; we believe hiding from the fire,' Allegheny County district attorney Stephen Zappala told CBS Pittsburgh. Her cousin later gave officers 'sufficient evidence' that he had started the fire on purpose. Children under 10 cannot be charged with . murder, but court proceedings could be used to . possibly remove him from his family. Investigation: District attorney Stephen Zappala, far right, meets police outside the remains of the house . Blaze: The fire destroyed three homes and seriously damaged a fourth . 'This is arson,' Zappala said. 'This was not an accident. You light pieces of paper together, furniture starts to combust. 'Given the structure of the house and the construction of the house, it went up in a hurry.' Zappala told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that the landlord, Steel City Realty Investments, may have violated a law requiring smoke detectors to be fitted in homes. No smoke alarms were heard as the blaze ripped through the properties, and firefighters said the have not yet found any among the rubble of the buildings. An investigation into the fire and any possible violations is ongoing. The rental company has not yet commented.

"By . Associated Press . Stacey Dean Rambold was only given a one month prison sentence for his rape against a 14-year-old victim he said 'looked older than her age' A former Billings, Montana teacher convicted of rape wrongly blamed his 14-year-old victim when he argued that she bore responsibility in the case, an attorney for the state said on Thursday in a court filing. The office of Attorney General Tim Fox is appealing Stacey Dean Rambold's one-month prison sentence to the Montana Supreme Court. The state says he should have served a mandatory minimum of four years after pleading guilty to sexual assault without consent. Rambold, 54, is fighting the appeal. In a brief submitted to justices Thursday, Assistant Attorney General Tammy Plubell chastised Rambold for suggesting the victim should share in the blame. That assertion from Rambold was contained in arguments submitted by his attorneys. Victim Cherice Moralez killed herself while the case against Rambold was pending. Rambold was 47 at the time of his crime. Under state law, children younger than 16 cannot consent to sexual intercourse. 'Rambold continues to perpetuate the myth that a 14-year-old girl should bear responsibility for her sexual victimization by a 47-year-old teacher,' Plubell wrote. 'The law, though, rightly defines her as blameless.' Rambold's attorneys have argued that the original sentence from state District Judge G. Todd Baugh was appropriate. In a brief submitted to the state's high court last month, they urged justices to reject the appeal. Citing Moralez's statements in interviews with law enforcement recorded before her death, Rambold attorneys Jay Lansing and Nancy Schwartz said there was 'no rational basis' to conclude a 14-year-old could bear responsibility only as the offender in a rape case. A 14-year-old victim can bear responsibility, too, the attorneys suggested. The interviews are under court seal and have not been made public. Lansing and Schwartz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They have turned down previous interview requests. Rambold said that his 14-year-old victim Cherice Moralez (pictured here) was responsible for his actions because she appeared older than her age . The victim Cherice Moralez killed herself while the case against Rambold was pending . Moralez was a freshman at Billings High School when she was raped. Rambold was her business teacher. She committed suicide in 2010, an act her mother said was driven largely by the rape. The girl's death took away the prosecution's main witness, and Rambold initially avoided prison under a deferred-prosecution agreement that included sex-offender treatment. He violated the agreement by having unauthorized visits with relatives' children and having a sexual relationship with an adult woman, according to court documents. That re-opened the case and led to the August sentence from Baugh of 15 years in prison with all but one month suspended. Rambold was released in September. Baugh unsuccessfully sought to impose a longer term after coming under criticism for saying during the sentencing hearing that the victim 'appeared older than her chronological age.' Montana's Judicial Standards Commission has asked the Supreme Court to censure Baugh for imposing an unlawful sentence and blaming the child victim. The panel investigated the case after receiving hundreds of complaints about the judge.

"By . Louise Boyle In Darrington, Washington . Nichole Webb Rivera was teaching a class when she first found out about the Oso mudslide through a Facebook message from a friend in her home town. Mrs Rivera, 39, who grew up in Darrington, Washington, but now lives in Texas, said that it was a few hours later, after numerous calls went to unanswered, that she realized with growing dread that her daughter Delaney, the 20-year-old's fiance Alan and her parents were among the scores of people missing. Delaney Webb, 20, and her husband-to-be Alan Bejvl had driven up from their apartment in Everett, Washington, to visit her grandparents Thom and Marcy Satterlee last weekend. Lost: Delaney Webb, 20, and her husband-to-be are listed among the missing and presumed dead in the Washington mudslide . Heartbroken: Nichole Webb Rivera learned the horrific news about her daughter and future son-in-law and her parents, Thom and Marcy Satterlee, in a Facebook message from a friend . Loving couple: In this undated photo provided by Nichole Webb Rivera, Rivera's daughter, Delaney Webb, right, and her fiance, Alan Bejvl, left, are shown . Striking beauty: Delaney's grieving mother described her daughter as the 'most beautiful, sweetest girl with the biggest heart' The young couple, who got engaged last October, had been planning to go over their summer wedding plans. Mrs Rivera, a mother-of-five, told MailOnline today: 'I stayed up all night listening to a police scanner online. My ex-husband and two sons drove up to Oso when they first heard but were turned back by rescuers. 'By Sunday morning, I knew that I had to be there. I'm the eldest child and Delaney is my oldest daughter, so I bought a one-way ticket.' Although Mrs Rivera said that she always holds on to hope, the reality she believes is that her family are gone. 'We lost four,' she added. She described her daughter Delaney as the 'most beautiful, sweetest girl with the biggest heart. I am blessed to have had her for 19 years'. Dashed hopes: The 20-year-old bride was set to walk down the aisle in the summer, and she traveled to Oso, Washington, over the weekend to talk about the wedding plans with her grandparents . Unaccounted: Rivera's parents, Thom and Marcy Satterlee, are among the dozens of people currently missing in the aftermath of the slide . She said that Delaney's fiancé, Alan, who is also from the Snohomish County, 'would be next to the Wikipedia entry for a perfect man.’ 'He was respectful, had a good sense of humor, was a lovely young man. He and my daughter were crazy in love and so happy together,' Mrs Rivera said. 'I'm just grateful that they went together and on a high note in their lives.' Her father, Thom, a Vietnam veteran who spent many years recovering from PTSD, was brilliant with a 'heart the size of that mudslide.’ Mr Satterlee, who had 52 first cousins, even more second cousins and 6 grandchildren, would have helped anyone he could, especially in a disaster situation like this, his daughter said Wednesday. Hoping against hope: Nichole Webb Rivera said she knows her daughter is likely among the dead, even though the family are still praying for a miracle . Marcy Satterlee was remembered by her daughter as beautiful and hysterically funny - 'she would make you wet your pants laughing' - as well as a talented artist who loved to be outside, working on her garden. Mrs Rivera's remarkable show of strength is in part for the sake of those around her. She said her two teenage sons Sam, 17, and Jarron Webb, 14, had said little since the disaster. 'It's hard to tell with teenagers', the mom added. Her sons and their elder sister, Delaney, also just lost their stepmom in January. Delaney also has two other half-sisters who are desperately waiting on any news. Mrs Rivera, who lives in Houston with her husband, Vince, and their son aged five and two-year-old daughter, said that the eldest girl asks constantly for Delaney. The mother has explained to her that her big sister is missing, to which she responds that 'she doesn't want her sister to be died,’ Mrs Rivera said. She said that the elder members of the family are 'beside themselves with grief,' but that they are praying and coming together to make decisions about what next steps should be taken as they wait for news. Natural disaster: This March 24, 2014 aerial photo released by the U.S. Geological Survey shows the extent and impacts from the March 22 mudslide near Arlington in northwest Washington state . Altered landscape: The slide destroyed a rural community, likely killing at least 24, and left scores missing . Linne Haywood, community volunteer and high school teacher, organizes donations at the Darrington Community Center in Darrington, Wash., on Wednesday, March 26, 2014 . Community members gather in Darrington for a prayer service at the Darrington High School auditorium on Wednesday night . Mrs Rivera, who is a textile artist with her own bespoke quilting business, has set up a fundraising page which has raised close to $17,000. Mrs Rivera said that 'in the spirit of my dad who hated bureaucracy' she was organizing to have the money shared directly with those affected by the mudslide tragedy. She said that fundraising was a way she could show her own gratitude to all the volunteers and rescuers in Darrington who have gone out into the field to recover their families, friends and neighbors. 'We take care of our own, that's what we do up there. People have hearts of gold.'I want  to do something to show that I love them,' she said. Despite her own devastating losses, Mrs Rivera still holds on to her sense of hope. She added: 'I am hopeful that something will come from this whole tragedy.

Rough terrain: Searchers using dogs kept slogging through the mess of broken wood and mud again Wednesday, looking for more bodies . Grim operation: Heavy equipment was brought it to clean the landslide that is covering State Route 530 near Oso . 'It shows that helping people is powerful and it's possible. I'm hopeful the community will recover and thrive and be stronger than before.' Search crews using dogs, bulldozers and their bare hands kept slogging through the mess of broken wood and mud again Wednesday, looking for more bodies or anyone who might still be alive nearly five days after a wall of fast-moving earth destroyed a small rural community. But authorities have acknowledged they might have to leave some victims buried because trying to recover every corpse would be impractical and dangerous. Previously, authorities said they believed they had found 24 bodies from the slide that swept through a rural area north of Seattle on Saturday, though not all had been removed from the area. The debris field is about a square mile and 30 to 40 feet deep in places, with a moon-like surface that includes quicksand-like muck, rain-slickened mud and ice. The terrain is difficult to navigate on foot and makes it treacherous or impossible to bring in heavy equipment.","Nichole Webb Rivera told MailOnline her daughter Delaney and fiance Alan Bejvi were visiting her grandparents in the Oso area when mudslide struck .

"By . James  Nye . Worrying new study: Coleen Boyle, Director of the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the CDC in Atlanta . Rates of autism in the United States rocketed by nearly 30 percent between 2008 and 2010 and have more than doubled since the beginning of the century, according to a worrying new study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The condition now affects 1 in 68 U.S. children - which in effect means that every grade in every elementary school in the country has an autistic child - which is an astonishing rise in numbers for a condition that was unheard of 25-years ago. The study does not explain why the numbers have so dramatically risen, but much  of the increase is believed to be from a cultural and medical shift, with doctors diagnosing autism more frequently, especially in children with milder cases of the condition. 'We don't know the extent those factors explain in terms of the increase, but we clearly know they do play a role,' said Coleen Boyle, director of the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the CDC to USA Today. 'Our system tells us what's going on. It only gives us clues as to the why.' Experts have also made a link between parents who have children later on in life. However, Robert Ring, the chief science officer for Autism Speaks said that he believes the problem needs to be confronted and that something in the environment may be causing the problem. The latest report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which looks at data from 2010, estimates that 14.7 per 1,000 8-year-olds in 11 U.S. communities have autism. That compares with the prior estimate of 1 in 88 children, or 11.3 of 1,000 8-year-olds, in 2008, and 1 in 150 children in 2000 . Other experts told USA Today that they were not surprised at all by the increase and said that numbers were only set to rise. They pointed out that in New Jersey, autism rates were 50 percent higher than the rest of the nation in 2000 and were still much higher in 2010. This suggests that national rates will only catch up to those in New Jersey. 'We can't dismiss the numbers. But we can't interpret it to mean more people are getting the disorder,' said Marisela Huerta, a psychologist at the New York-Presbyterian Center for Autism and the Developing Brain in suburban White Plains, N.Y. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the latest estimate Thursday. The Atlanta-based agency said its calculation means autism affects roughly 1.2 million Americans under 21. Two years ago, the CDC put the estimate at 1 in 88 children, or about 1 million. The cause or causes of autism are still not known. Without any blood test or other medical tests for autism, diagnosis is not an exact science. It's identified by making judgments about a child's behavior. Autism encompasses a spectrum of disorders, ranging from a profound inability to communicate and mental retardation to relatively mild symptoms in people with very high intellectual ability . A child diagnosed on the autism spectrium must show deficits in three distinct areas: communications, social skills and typical behavior. Roughly one-third of children in the CDC study also showed intellectual problems, but the other two-thirds showed above-average intelligence. Thursday's report is considered the most comprehensive on the frequency of autism. Researchers gathered data in 2010 from areas in 11 states — Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin. The report focused on 8-year-olds because most autism is diagnosed by that age. The researchers checked health and school records to see which children met the criteria for autism, even if they hadn't been formally diagnosed. Then, the researchers calculated how common autism was in each place and overall. The CDC started using this method in 2007 when it came up with an estimate of 1 in 150 children. Two years later, it went to 1 in 110. In 2012, it went to 1 in 88. Last year, the CDC released results of a less reliable calculation — from a survey of parents — which suggested as many as 1 in 50 children have autism. Experts aren't surprised by the growing numbers, and some say all it reflects is that doctors, teachers and parents are increasingly likely to say a child with learning and behavior problems is autistic. Some CDC experts say screening and diagnosis are clearly major drivers, but that they can't rule out some actual increase as well. 'We cannot say what portion is from better diagnosis and improved understanding versus if there's a real change,' said Coleen Boyle, the CDC official overseeing research into children's developmental disabilities. For decades, autism meant kids with severe language, intellectual and social impairments and unusual, repetitious behaviors. But the definition has gradually expanded and now includes milder, related conditions. The study showed significantly different autism rates by region, ranging from 1 in 175 children in Alabama to 1 in 45 children in New Jersey, which could reflect access to healthcare and other factors . One sign of that: In the latest study, almost half of autistic kids had average or above average IQs. That's up from a third a decade ago and can be taken as an indication that the autism label is more commonly given to higher-functioning children, CDC officials acknowledged. Aside from that, much in the latest CDC report echoes earlier findings. Autism and related disorders continue to be diagnosed far more often in boys than girls, and in whites than blacks or Hispanics. The racial and ethnic differences probably reflects white communities' greater focus on looking for autism and white parents' access to doctors, because there's no biological reason to believe whites get autism more than other people, CDC officials said at a press briefing Thursday. One change CDC officials had hoped to see, but didn't, was a drop in the age of diagnosis. Experts say a diagnosis can now be made at age 2 or even earlier. But the new report said the majority of children continue to be diagnosed after they turn 4. 'We know the earlier a child is identified and connected with services, the better,' Boyle said. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a statement Thursday, saying the nation needs to step up screening for the condition and research into autism's causes. 'It's critical that we as a society do not become numb to these numbers,' said Dr. Susan Hyman, head of the group's autism subcommittee.","As many as one in 68 U.S. children may have autism, U.S. health officials said on Thursday .

She is brilliant, she writes well, she speaks eloquently, she is zealous but not overly so, she is always prepared, she treats others, including her opponents, with civility and respect, she wears very short skirts and shows lots of her ample chest. I especially appreciate the last two attributes,' he wrote. He then goes on to give another example of an allegedly inappropriately dressed lawyer but this time says that the criticism came to his attention by way of 'the sisterhood' of female law clerks that he works with. He writes that they 'seethed and sneered' at the woman's 'unprofessional' choice of dress. The judge's proposed solutions for the problem do not help the situation, starting off by writing: 'You can’t win. Men are both pigs and prudes. Get over it.' Legal mind: Kopf, who was given his lifetime appointment by George H.W. Bush in 1992, wrote about how a lawyer's short skirts and low-cut shirts are the attributes he admires about her most . He finishes by warning women to 'tone it down' if they ever think that female law clerks 'are likely to label you, like Jane Curtain, an ignorant slut,' including a link to a Saturday Night Live skit where Dan Ackroyd hurls the insult at Curtain. Judge Kopf was appointed to his position by former President George H.W. Bush in 1992. Because federal judges are appointed for life, he can only leave the bench if he resigns, dies, or is impeached by the House of Representatives after being convicted by the Senate. Unsurprisingly, the post prompted an immediate backlash and a local columnist for the Omaha World-Herald took him to task, and he immediately wrote a somewhat apologetic if not conciliatory second post. 'If, on balance, you think the post was harmful to the image of the federal judiciary and truly treated women as objects, I am very, very, very sorry for that, but I would ask you to pause and reread it,' he says, addressing columnist Erin Grace. Back in the day: Nebraska-based Kopf, seen here in 2001, told women 'you can't win. Men are both pigs and prudes. Get over it' 'I hope you will find upon objective reflection that the mockery I make of myself and the hyperbole and somewhat mordant tone I employed, made a point worth considering.' This is not the first time that the judge has been arguably overly candid on his blog, which he describes as being a place for his musings on ‘the role of the federal trial judge’. He told Congress to ‘go to hell’ during the government shutdown last fall and included a link to the Urban Dictionary definition of ‘bats***’. The Wall Street Journal reports that the judge originally wrote in January that he was going to quit blogging, prompting some to think that this latest post was the result of his site being hacked. Instead, it appears that he decided to saddle back up to the keyboard and has been particularly prolific this week, following the ‘dirty old man’ post with a detailed account of his treatment for stage III classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma.","U.S. District Judge Richard Kopf has written a blog post urging female lawyers not to wear short skits and low-cut shirts .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . An Arkansas mother who was arrested in a restaurant for breastfeeding her baby after having two beers has defended her decision to have a drink. Mother-of-three Tasha Adams had been at a Conway restaurant with her family for dinner in November when an off-duty waitress reported her to police for consuming alcohol. Adams, 28, was arrested for child endangerment and taken to jail, and her six-month-old baby Ana was left in the care of her family. Defense: Tasha Adams says despite having two drinks she was sober enough to care for and feed her baby . Caring: Mother-of-three Tasha Adams, pictured with her husband and baby girl, Ana . Charges against Adams were dropped last week because there wasn't enough evidence to prove she had been too drunk to care for her child. But the 28-year-old told ABC's 20/20 she wishes the police had given her a breathalyzer test at the restaurant to prove she hadn't endangered her baby. 'If I’m drunk, I feel, you know, that . I’m not able to take care of my kids,' Adams said. 'I wish they would’ve . given me a breathalyzer so it could be proven.' Adams, a florist from Toad Suck, had stopped off at the Gusano's Pizzeria in Conway after attending a funeral with her parents. She ordered two beers with her meal, which she drank slowly over nearly two hours. 'Some people I'm sure can drink two beers and get buzzed or drunk. I can't,' she said in an interview, due to be broadcast on ABC this Friday. Adams added that she did drink and breastfeed, but said: 'I didn't know it was illegal. If I knew it was illegal, I wouldn't have done it.' However, a waitress who had stopped at the restaurant for a staff meeting, was shocked to see a nursing mom who had been drinking. Arrest: Charges of endangering a child were dropped against Adams, seen here in her booking photo . Jackie Conners reported Adams to the restaurant's management, and then contacted police when no action was taken. Conners, who has a young child of her own, lost her job shortly after reporting Adams to police, but said if she would do it again if faced with the same situation. 'Even if I knew . my job was on the line and it was right around the holidays, I would . still do it again,' she told 20/20. A manager at Gusanao’s said last year that Conners was not fired for reporting the customer, but declined to give more information on the matter. Reported: Tasha Adams, pictured with her baby, left, was arrested after Jackie Conners, right, called police . Adams says that while she knows she . was sober enough to care for and feed her baby, she can understand why . Conners reacted in the way she did. 'Whether it was right or wrong in my . eyes is different, you know, but if she really thought my baby was in . danger, you know, maybe she done the right thing,' Adams said. Arkansas . law doesn't ban drinking and breastfeeding, and experts say little . research has been done on whether it does affect a nursing child. Dr . Jennifer Ashton said: 'Moderate consumption, which really means once . and a while to consume a drink, probably will not do any harm for the . baby. 'But we have to remember that alcohol is a toxin. It’s especially toxic to the newborn's brain, to the developing brain.' Scientists . have not yet determined how much alcohol is found in a mother's milk, . but women are advised to either use a breast pump before having a drink, . or switching to formula for a few hours.","Tasha Adams says she did have two drinks but was sober enough to feed her baby girl .

"By . Wills Robinson . Blow: Entrepreneur Rob Law was dealt a crushing blow as judges ruled a rival to his Trunki children's suitcase does not infringe on his design rights . An inventor has become the 'Dragons' Den' most successful reject - after selling two million sit-on suitcases. Entrepreneur Rob Law came up with his idea for the Trunki in 1997 but was turned down when he appeared on the BBC show in 2006. Despite the rejection, he invested thousands of pounds into developing the product and it is now very popular baggage item among families. Mr Law, of Clifton, Bristol, now enjoys a turnover of over £7 million a year and his company employs 30 people. During his first appearance on the programme, he asked for £100,000 in exchange for  a 10 per cent share of his company. The Dragon's initially took a liking to the product with Deborah Meadon and Theo Paphitis saying it was 'cute'. He introduced the merchandise as a suitcase 'todllers can pack, sit on and ride... while parents can keep their children in tow.' But Theo got hold of the product and managed to break one of the straps, leading the rest of the Dragons to question its quality. He then received the negative verdict of 'I'm out' from all of the judges and left the Den without his desired investment. Seven years on however, his business has turned into a success story. This year the firm moved into a new phase when it bought its own factory in Devon and moved production of its suitcases to the UK. To mark the two-million milestone, Trunki produced two special suitcases complete with gold horns. A competition has been launched – and more than 1,000 people have signed up on Facebook for the chance to win one of the cases. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sucessful: Mr Law employs more than 50 people and enjoys a turnover of more than £7 million a year . Practical: Globetrotting children can sit on the suitcase as their parents pull them along . Design: His invention is made from the same material as adult suitcase brands and can be ridden like a toy . Demonstration: He sat on one of his products during his appearance in front of the Dragons in 2006. But he left the Den disappointed as one by one the Dragons declared 'I'm out' This year has also seen the firm win a major law case against a rival company, and land £4 million worth of funding to help pay for its expansion plans over the coming 12 months. The factory in Devon was bought a little over a year ago and went into administration almost immediately. But around 50 jobs were rescued when Magma Moulding, the manufacturing division of Trunki, purchased the factory out of administration. Mr Law has never regretted the decision to take over the manufacturing side of the business. He said: 'We had only recently started UK manufacturing when the factory went into administration.' Test: Former Dragon Richard Farleigh was the first to try the sit-on suitcases . Curious: The Dragons were initially impressed with the product, with Theo and Deborah (second and third from right) calling it 'cute' Dreams dashed: Mr Law felt the investment slipping away when Theo Paphitis managed to break one of the straps .","Rob Law from Clifton, Bristol, invented the Trunki in 1997 .

"By . David Mccormack . and Snejana Farberov . A petition calling on the network A&E to reinstate Phil Robertson on the hit reality show Duck Dynasty has now met - and surpassed - its target of 250,000 signatures. As of Friday morning, more than 253,000 supporters of the controversial reality star have electronically signed to have him back on the show after he had been suspended indefinitely for making homophobic and racially charged remarks during an interview with GQ magazine. The petition is being spearheaded by the Christian conservative group Faith Driven Consumer, which is also behind the site IStandWithPhil.com. Scroll down for video . Executives at A&E have admitted that they could have done more to dampen the hysteria surrounding Phil Robertson's anti-gay remarks by immediately taking the hit reality show off the air for two weeks . Cause celebre: A petition calling on the network A&E to reinstate Phil Robertson on the hit show Duck Dynasty has surpassed - its target of 250,000 signatures . Bowing to pressure? A&E is set to rake in mountains of ad revenue as the network decides to air 11-hour Duck Dynasty marathon in spite of star Phil Robertson's anti-gay tirade . An open letter accompanying the . petition accuses A&E of 'intolerant, discriminatory, and punitive . treatment' of the 67-year-old Robertson patriarch. The . author goes on to say that Robertson's comments equating homosexuality . with terrorism and bestiality 'are simply reflective of a biblical view . of sexuality, marriage and faith - a view that has stood the test of . time for thousands of years and continues to be held by the majority of . Americans and today’s world as a whole.' The . right-wing organization has condemned A&E for discriminating . against Robertson for expressing a perspective conflicting with the . LGBT agenda, calling it ‘patently un-American.' The . goal of the petition is to have Robertson back on the show and force . A&E to formally apologize to him, his family and their supporters. The . letter concludes with a stern warning that if the group's demands are . not met, tens of millions of ‘Faith Driven Consumers’ in the U.S. will . stop watching A&E programming altogether. Duck Dynasty, the most popular reality show of all times following the foibles of the Robertson family in Monroe, Louisiana - the site of their successful duck call business - has been embroiled in controversy since homophobic quotes made by Robertson in the January 2014 issue of GQ Magazine became public last Wednesday. In . the immediate aftermath of the scandal, A&E sought to distance . itself from Robertson by suspending him indefinitely, and saying 'his . personal views in no way reflect those of A&E'. Phil Robertson (pictured second left) is also on record making racially insensitive remarks suggesting that blacks didn't need civil rights reform in order to be happy . Robertson's fans, from average viewers to political leaders, have been hard at work lobbying for his return. A Facebook page called 'Boycott A&E Until Phil Robertson Is Put Back on Duck Dynasty' has sprung up, drawing more than 1.7 million 'likes.' A second petition on Change.org titled 'A&E Network: Bring Phil Robertson back!' has more than 118,600 signers. Robertson, the patriarch of the Louisiana clan on the reality show about hunting, fishing and domestic squabbles, was put on indefinite hiatus by A&E last week for his remarks to GQ magazine characterizing homosexuality as sinful behavior. The network has previously said it was disappointed after reading Robertson's remarks, which it added were his personal views and did not reflect those of the network. Civil rights groups GLAAD strongly  criticized the comments, but the 67-year-old Robertson also found supporters among Republican politicians such as former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas. However, in a Monday interview with Fox News anchor Great Van Susteren, the former Alaska governor admitted that she came to Robertson's defense without ever reading his interview in GQ. 'I haven’t read the article,' Palin said. 'I don’t know exactly how he said it.' Sarah Palin, pictured with the Duck Dynasty cast while on her book tour in Louisiana. The former governor and her daughter, Bristol, have defended Robertson . The future of the popular series, . which is scheduled to begin its previously taped fifth season on Jan. 15, is up in the air following Robertson's indefinite suspension and his . family hinted that they would not participate without him. ‘We . have had a successful working relationship with A&E but, as a . family, we cannot imagine the show going forward without our patriarch . at the helm,' the family said in a statement last Thursday. The . standoff between the Robertson family and A&E has put big money in . the balance as the impasse also threatens a vast array of 'Duck Dynasty' licensed merchandise that has brought in some $400 million, according . to Forbes magazine.

He calls her Princess Lacey. 'Adreian's my brother,' she added. 'I just think of him and I smile.' The duo met in Lansing's Sparrow Hospital at the start of 2012, a month after Lacey was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a form of childhood cancer that originates in the nerves. Doctors discovered that she had two tumors - one in her abdomen roughly the size of a football and another wrapped around her spine, according to her fundraising page.

He has also battled breathing issues due to small lungs, but he has learned to take smaller breaths. 'It can't be all about you,' Payne said. 'That’s true with your teammates. What can you do to help make them better? And it’s true with others you meet. 'It's more important to have a role in other people's lives that you care for.' He said that as soon as he met Lacey, he was touched by her fighting spirit. 'She calls me her ""Superman"", but . she’s the one who's got the super strength,' Payne said. 'And if I can . bring her a little bit of happiness to help her forget everything for a . little while, then that’s what I want to do.' By his side: Lacey joined Payne as he cut down the net after the Big Ten championship earlier this month . Champions: Payne said he just wants to bring Lacey happiness so she can forget her pain for a little while . Lacey’s cancer was thought to have been beaten last summer but it returned last fall and she continues to undergo treatment. She suffered a seizure on Tuesday, but she'll continue to be rooting for Payne and Michigan State in the Sweet 16 in the NCAA Tournament. 'It's like having a family member that's really sick and ill,' he told Mlive. 'The only thing you can do is just play basketball because you can't be there with them.

"By . Tara Brady . The daughter of Uzbekistan's president is allegedly being kept under house arrest by her father who 'sent men to beat her up'. Gulnara Karimova, 41, is said to be being held by security forces from her father's dictatorial regime on allegations of corruption. According to the BBC she managed to smuggle a letter out to inform people of her arrest. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Gulnara Karimova (left) is believed to be being held under house arrest and her father Islam Karimov is alleged to have sent men round to assault his daughter, it has been claimed . In it she wrote: 'How naive was I to think that the rule of law exists in the country? 'The reason for the Pinochet-style persecution is that I dared to speak up about things that millions are quiet about.' According to sources, Ms Karimova, who is a pop star in Uzbekistan, was put under house arrest with her 15-year-old daughter on February 17. Her father, Islam Karimov is believed to have ordered 20 to 30 men to raid her apartment after she suggested travelling to Israel for medical treatment because she feared doctors may try and kill her in Uzbekistan. According to sources, Ms Karimova was put under house arrest with . her 15-year-old daughter on February 17 . According to uznews.net Ms Karimova's partner was arrested and beaten up. Ms Karimova tried to escape but was dragged back to the flat where she was beaten, it is alleged. It also emerged last week that Swedish prosecutors are investigating Ms Karimova on suspicion of taking bribes to let Nordic telecoms company TeliaSonera enter the country's market . Ms Karimova had already been named by the Swiss public prosecutor as a suspect in the case which is also being investigated by Dutch and U.S. authorities. Prosecutors are looking into allegations that when TeliaSonera paid 2.3 billion Swedish crowns (Â£216million) for a 3G licence in Uzbekistan in 2007 to Gibraltar-registered firm Takilant, it knew the company was a front for Ms Karimova. Gulnara Karimova, who performs under the name Googoosha, starring her music video How Dare . The allegations, first made in a Swedish television programme in 2012, have already forced most of the TeliaSonera board, its chief executive and several senior employees from their jobs. In a request to a Stockholm court asking for more time to bring charges, Swedish prosecutors said they suspected that representatives for TeliaSonera had bribed members of Uzbekistan's 'political elite'. 'In the investigation there is now a concrete basis, including information on control over assets, which gives reason to suspect that Gulnara Karimova, who also served as a public official during the time period relevant for the case, was the one who orchestrated, controlled, and also was the one who primarily benefited from the procedure,' the prosecutors said. She has in the past denied allegations of business impropriety. TeliaSonera, which has appointed its own lawyers to investigate its past business deals in Uzbekistan and other countries in the region, said it was collaborating with the prosecutors. Uzbekistan's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva from December 2008 until last year, Ms Karimova is also a jewellery designer and pop singer whose stage name is Googoosha.

"By . Chris Greenwood . Multi-millionaire Robert Ekaireb, 39, was convicted yesterday of killing Li Hua Cao (above), 27, in a jealous rage . A wealthy property developer who murdered his pregnant wife is suspected of recruiting one of Britain’s most notorious crime syndicates to dispose of her body. Multi-millionaire Robert Ekaireb, 39, was convicted yesterday of killing Li Hua Cao, 27, in a jealous rage. No trace of the Chinese lapdancer, known as Lisa, has been found since she vanished ‘into thin air’ more than seven years ago. Detectives suspect Li Hua was buried on the Olympic Park site as the ground was prepared for the huge project. Ekaireb was a successful businessman and wholesale gold jeweller based in London’s Hatton Garden, an Old Bailey jury was told. But the Mail can reveal he is closely linked to the Adams crime family, who are said to be responsible for up to 25 murders. Detectives discovered a complex web of links between Ekaireb and the Clerkenwell-based crime syndicate. In some cases their victims have never . been found and one former member has confessed to dismembering and . dumping at least four bodies. Police . found Ekaireb enjoyed the trappings of huge wealth from his portfolio . of 85 properties worth tens of millions of pounds across Hampstead, . Knightsbridge and Hendon. Ekaireb (left) met Li Hua when she was working as a lap dancer, but became obsessed by her past. The Mail can reveal he is closely linked to the Adams crime family, who are said to be responsible for up to 25 murders . He lived in a flat with a gold-plated toilet, a £45,000 carpet and owned a fleet of prestige cars, including a Bentley. The killer spent the trial on bail after paying a £1million surety and was backed at earlier hearings by his brother Jason, a £3million-a-year Goldman Sachs banker. Property tycoon Robert Ekaireb was yesterday found guilty of killing . his pregnant wife Li Hua, 27, although her body has never been found . Ekaireb stared at his sobbing girlfriend in the public gallery as he was convicted of murder yesterday. Justice Spencer QC told him he will be jailed for life. The trial heard Li Hua had a whirlwind romance with Ekaireb after he paid her £270 for private dances at a lapdancing club in March 2006. Her family said she travelled from the coastal city of Dalian to the West to find a wealthy husband and at first he showered her with affection, cash and gifts. The couple married in China within weeks and had a simple ceremony at Barnet Register Office to formalise the arrangement. But 6ft 2in Ekaireb was obsessive, jealous and unstable, telling a psychologist he was scared of his anger and had visions of stabbing his 4ft 11in wife to death. Li Hua tried to leave him six times, but on every occasion he persuaded her to return. At the time of her disappearance she was 22 weeks pregnant, and her husband wanted her to take  a lie detector test to prove the  baby was his. Despite his jealousy, he continued to see a previous Slovakian lover and had an affair with a neighbour. Police believe Ekaireb killed her in a fit of rage fuelled by his suspicion that she was sneaking off to charge up to £600 a time for sex. Her last known actions were calls to her family on the night of October 23, 2006, when she said she was desperately unhappy and wanted to leave. Detectives traced how she called the businessman on his mobile before he returned home late that evening. A short time later he called the manager’s office of a West End club operated by a senior member of the Adams family. Police suspect he held a ‘council of war’ at the club to plan the disposal of her body. It was not until February 2007 that Li Hua’s family reported her disappearance. A missing person inquiry  began which later became a full murder inquiry in 2010. By then police could find no trace of the young woman with her bank accounts left untouched, her mobile unused and no record of the baby being born. Pavilion Court in Hampstead, where the couple shared a one-bedroom flat. The Old Bailey heard Ekarieb had the flat completely re-carpeted and redecorated in the months after his pregnant wife disappeared . Ekaireb, who was arrested as he tried . to fly to Prague with a one-way ticket, claimed she simply walked out. Detectives found he ordered builders to completely redecorate and . re-carpet the £1million flat they shared within weeks of her . disappearance. A second flat which Ekaireb shared with his previous girlfriend on the same private gated estate was left like a ‘time capsule’. When police searched it in 2010 they found it had been left untouched since October 2006, with cake half-eaten on a table. After the killing Ekaireb went back to the Slovakian girlfriend and the couple had a baby girl. She is now pregnant again. Detectives suspect Li Hua was buried on the Olympic Park site as the ground was prepared for the huge project . Investigators were stunned by Ekaireb’s gaudy possessions and brash sense of fashion. He owned a laptop studded with ‘diamonds’ reading, Robert ‘the one and only’ Ekaireb. The ‘time capsule’ flat had a gold-plated toilet as well as an expensive gold-leaf carpet with the Versace logo embroidered in it. Detectives found Ekaireb and his father Rex, a chartered accountant, amassed their property empire from 2006 onwards and owned scores of homes worth up to £3million each. Officers repeatedly tried to speak to members of the Adams family, but were blocked by lawyers who accused them of harassment. Ekaireb will be sentenced in January.","Robert Ekaireb, 38, murdered 22 weeks pregnant Li Hua Cao, 27, in 2006 .

"By . Luke Garratt . A man who ate more than 15 stone of Sugar Puffs a year has lost nine stone in sixth months after completely cutting the cereal from his diet. Andy Mack, 39, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, used to weigh 29 stone and ate three family size boxes a week - more than 150 every year. Mr Mack said this was a major reason for his original weight gain but he has now shed the pounds after replacing Sugar Puffs with a more healthy breakfast. Andy Mack's old diet consisted of 15 stone worth of Sugar Puffs a year and massive portions of rice and pasta. He has now lost nine stone in six months after cutting out the cereal and exercising more . Mr Mack said: 'I was told cereal was a healthy breakfast so I thought I could eat as much of it as I liked. 'I’d often find myself refilling my mammoth bowl just to make sure I felt full.' Mr Mack believes that it wasn't just the Sugar Puffs that had an effect - he also consumed a huge number of snacks throughout the day. He said: 'I pretty much had the diet of an elephant. I thought I was eating well. 'When I fancied a snack I would have an apple. But I never just ate one apple, I would eat about eight apples in a row. 'After that I would have five bananas to fill myself up.' Andy Mack used to eat three family sized boxes of Sugar Puffs a week, thinking that because 'eating cereal was healthy' he could eat as much as he wanted . Now that he has given up the cereal, he has lost around nine stone due to his new diet . Breakfast: A portion of Sugar Puffs in a fruit bowl - and possibly seconds. Snacks: Six or seven apples back-to-back, followed by four or five bananas. Lunch: A sandwich with four slices of bread instead of two. Fillings comprised of meat and cheese with mayonnaise or salad cream. Afternoon snack: Six or seven apples back-to-back, followed by four or five bananas. Dinner: Massive portion of rice or pasta with pasta sauce or meat - sometimes followed by a second serving. Once a week: A takeaway with all the sides, starters and extras available . Alcohol: 15-20 pints on one night a week . Exercise: Minimal . Breakfast: No cereal, instead he has a light breakfast controlled by his fitness program . Snacks: None . Lunch: A sensibly portioned light lunch, with healthy fillings if it is a sandwich. Otherwsie he has a salad. Afternoon snack: None . Dinner: A sensibly portioned dinner of regular food, such as pasta or rice, but limited to one serving and a regular sized portion. Takeaways are off the menu . Alcohol: None . Exercise: Andy now trains four times a week for an hour at a time at his gym - this includes cycling, running, weights and a mixture of cardio and free weight lifting . When it came to dinner, Mr Mack once again piled his plate high thinking he was being healthy. He said: 'On certain diets things like pasta and rice are ""free foods"" so I thought there was no limit on the amount I could eat. Andy Mack has been compared to the Honey Monster, the popular mascot of Sugar Puffs cereal . 'My portion sizes were as big as my head. I would have seconds too. 'The trouble is, the more you eat the more you want.' Mr Mack had always been overweight but had ridden bikes to keep his fitness levels up. So when an opportunity arose for him to do a bike ride last year in support of a charity set up by family friends, following their young son Jack’s diagnosis with a rare illness, he jumped at the chance. But he soon found that his weight was holding him back. He said: 'I thought it would be a ride in the park but I seriously struggled. This race nearly broke me. 'It . took me 10 hours to complete the race which took the average person . only six. I didn’t think I was going to make it to the finish line. 'I was so shocked at how much I struggled, I knew I had to do something. 'I decided I would lose this weight I had been carrying around for years and sort myself out.' Mr Mack set himself a target to lose nine stone in six months to raise money for the charity. Andy Mack (before his diet, left) struggled to ride his bike when he was at his heaviest and realised he had to start training (right). He now exercises more and has cut his portion sizes dramatically . He said: 'My friend Nick Wilkinson is a previous big weight loss loser and he came up with the idea that I should lose the weight for the ""Joining Jack"" charity.' Mr Mack, who plays in a pub band, would get free drinks during a gig, and would sometimes drink 20 pints in one night . The charity was set up by friends Alex and Andy Johnson, whose son suffers from the rare muscle wasting condition Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, which affects one in approximately 3500 boys worldwide and currently has no cure. They are hoping to raise money to find a treatment for the disease and Mr Mack's massive weight loss has helped in a huge way. He has raised £7,300 for the charity, at the same time as shedding nine stone in six months. Mr Mack said: 'I have drastically changed my diet and I have my portion sizes under control. 'I go train four times a week and follow their strict diet plan. 'No more Sugar Puffs for me.' His successful loss of nine stone and has taken 14 inches off his waist. After weighing 28 stone 8 pounds Mr Mack now weighs a much healthier 19 stone. He said: 'I’ve lost so much weight that people I know don’t even recognise me in the street. 'I just want to be fit and healthy and I am not going to stop until I am just that. 'Raising money for Joining Jack in the process is that added push and keeps me going.' Mr Mack has signed himself up for the same bike ride challenge he struggled to finish for later this year and is hoping to shave four hours off his current personal best.","Andy Mack, 39, used to eat three family boxes of Sugar Puffs a week .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Bass Reeves, one of the first African Americans to become a Deputy U.S. Marshal west of the Mississippi River, could have been an inspiration for Quentin Tarantino’s fictional character Django. Reeves, who was born a slave, arrested 3,000 felons, killed 14 men and was never shot throughout his 32-year career as a federal lawman. The fearless solider was born into slavery in 1838 in Crawford County, Arkansas, and eventually broke from his owner, George Reeves, to live among the Creek and Seminole Indians. Scroll down for video . Real-life Django: Bass Reeves, born a slave, later became a Deputy U.S. Marshal and arrested 3,000 felons and killed 14 men . Appointment: Reeves became a Deputy U.S. Marshal in 1875 at the age of 38, after 'Hanging Judge' Isaac C. Parker was made the federal judge of Indian Territory . During his time with them, he learned their customs and languages and became an adept territorial scout. Reeves later procured his own land in Van Buren, Arkansas, where he married his wife, Nellie Jennie, built an eight-room house with his bare hands, and raised ten children as the first black settler in the region. He became a Deputy U.S. Marshal in 1875 at the age of 38, after ‘Hanging Judge’ Isaac C. Parker was made the federal judge of Indian Territory. Under President Ulysses S. Grant, Parker appointed Confederate Army General James Fagan a U.S. Marshal and ordered him to hire 200 deputies.Among them was Reeves. Fagan knew of the former slave, his ability to negotiate Indian Territory and his ability to speak their languages, and so Reeves was named the first black Deputy Marshal west of the Mississippi. In that role he was authorized to arrest both black and white outlaws. Legendary soldier: Reeves was authorized to arrest both black and white outlaws . Over the years Reeves gained a reputation for persistence, fearlessness. incredible marksmanship and the ability to outsmart lawbreakers, according to historical records. In 1882, Reeves arrested outlaw Belle Starr for horse theft. According to some accounts, Starr turned herself in when she heard that the legendary Reeves was looking for her. In 1889, after Reeves was assigned to Paris, Texas, he went after the Tom Story gang for their infamous horse theft operation. Reeves reportedly waited along the route that Tom Story used, and surprised the gang leader with an arrest warrant. Story panicked and drew his gun, but Reeves shot him dead before Story could fire. The rest of the Tom Story gang disbanded and were never heard from again. Fictional Reeves? Actor Jamie Foxx, right, plays Django, a character very similar to Reeves, in Quentin Tarantino's new movie 'Django Unchained' Reeves later killed two of the murderous Brunter brothers and arrested the third. In 1887, the black Deputy Marshall was arrested himself and charged with murdering his posse cook, William Leach. Brought to trial before Judge Parker, Reeves testified that he shot Leach by accident while cleaning his gun, and was acquitted. Reeves later became became an officer of the Muskogee, Oklahoma, police department at the age of 68. He died of Bright's disease on January 12, 1910, at the age of 72. 'Bass Reeves', a fictionalized film of the lawman’s life and military career was produced and released by Ponderous Productions of San Antonio, Texas, in 2010. Actor Morgan Freeman has spent more than five years attempting to get the story of Reeves to the big screen, according to the film news site IndieWire.com.

"By . Liz Hull . Fraud charges: Skermer, 45, yesterday before magistrates in Runcorn, Cheshire . A married banker has been charged with stealing more than £2 million from Barclays - allegedly blowing most of it on high-class prostitutes, it emerged yesterday. John Skermer, 45, is accused of stealing £2,148,793 from accounts under his control over a period of almost five years . It is understood the father of two then spent £1.9 million of the cash on prostitutes – with £1million going to one escort girl alone. The rest is believed to have been splashed on luxury items such as  holidays and fast cars. The alleged fraud was discovered during a routine audit by bosses who called in police. Yesterday Skermer appeared before magistrates in Runcorn, Cheshire, after being charged with four counts of fraud by abuse of his position. Alison Warburton, prosecuting, told the court Skermer also blew the money on gifts for family and friends, including luxury golfing holidays and tickets to see Manchester United matches. He also bought himself a £35,000 Audi car and handed £25,000 to a female acquaintance that he had met just once in order to help her move house. ‘Mr Skermer was in a position of authority within the bank which he exploited,’ Mrs Warburton said. ‘It was a breach of trust. And he took a vast amount of money from the bank. 'He used the money to fund his lavish lifestyle. Around £700,000 has been recovered, but the bank are still working to recover stolen goods.’ It is understood Skermer began working as a manager for Barclays in 2006. His role included looking after a software engineering team and retail accounts for the banking giant. The charges relate to a period of almost five years, between January 2009 and this month. Skermer, of Widnes, Cheshire, was granted bail before his next appearance at Chester Crown Court in April. He was accompanied to court by his maths teacher wife Tracy, 33. Support: Skermer's wife Tracy, a 33-year-old maths teacher, accompanied her husband to court . The couple, who have been married for ten years, live in a £400,000 detached house in Widnes with their two children. A spokesman for Barclays said no customers had been affected. ‘Protecting our customers’ money is our top priority and we have a zero tolerance approach to fraud,’ she said. ‘No customer has lost any money as we’ve taken swift and immediate action to ensure that this matter has been dealt with.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","John Skemer, 45, is charged with fraud by abuse of his position .

"By . Daniel Miller . Bacon has topped a list of Britain’s favourite 100 foods, ahead of chicken, chocolate and delicacies such as duck and lobster. Britain’s first ever Top 100 Food Index is a comprehensive study into what now makes up our favourite tastes. One in ten Brits named the breakfast and sandwich favourite their top food, followed by chicken and chocolate in second and third spots. Nation's choice: Bacon has been voted Britain's favourite food in the first ever Top 100 Index . The entire list ranges from the everyday - baked beans, jam and apples - to more exotic foods such as sushi and spices like ginger. Meat dominated the top 10 with steak, beef and lamb also featuring. The research, commissioned by Food . Network UK, found that the banana is now Britain’s favourite fruit, . coming in at number eight on the list, ahead of apples. Bananas are now our favourite fruit . And asparagus is our preferred vegetable, at number 14 in the list, with artichokes coming second at number 19. The study, carried out among 2,000 adults, also suggests we are not a nation of sweet tooths with ice cream, the top ranked favourite dessert, down in 27th. Salmon was voted the top fish, in 15th, ahead of anchovies in 24th. And chilli would seem to be our preferred spice, in 22nd. Quintessentially English spread Marmite was voted 35th favourite food. The study indicates bacon may retain top spot for years to come, with more than two thirds (67 per cent) of Brits saying their favourite food has been the same for the past ten years. Meanwhile, a third claim they could eat their favourite food every single day without ever tiring of it. British ingredients dominate with asparagus, blue cheese such as Stilton and strawberries making the top 20 and two-thirds claiming they use more British ingredients than 10 years ago. Although some more exotic foods are represented, such as chorizo, mango and lobster, the majority are more traditional fare, with bread at number 7. Not to everyone's taste: But anchovies (24th) and Marmite (35th) both ranked highly in the survey . Food Network UK chef Andy Bates said: 'The study shows we tend to be quite traditional and safe with our tastes - leaning towards ingredients considered staples rather than more unusual, luxury ingredients. 'We definitely favour foods we’re more familiar with but also those that are affordable, simple and versatile.' Nick Thorogood, Managing Director of Food Network, added: 'We are seeing a resurgence of British ingredients, including asparagus and black pudding - along with many others that made the Top 100 Index. Exotic: Foreign delicacies such as Spanish chorizo (39th) and Japanese sushi (58th) are also popular . 'It will be interesting to see how this list evolves in the next few years - Food Network UK aims to inspire people to try new foods but also new ways of cooking with existing ingredients.' Bacon, which contains Vitamin B1, B12, Zinc and Selenium, is one of the oldest processed meats in history - the Chinese began salting pork bellies as early as 1500BC. It is so popular that pigs from Yorkshire and Tamworth are bred especially for bacon. The phrase ‘to bring home the bacon’ comes from the ancient country fair sport of catching a greased pig.

"By . Sarah Johnson . Britons are abandoning traditional barbecue fare in favour of more upmarket foods including marinated meat, exotic salads and stuffed vegetables, a study has revealed. Many are ditching plain sausages and burgers in favour of grilled fish, succulent steaks and homemade coleslaw, according to research. In an effort to impress their guests, 22 per cent of Britons cook more unusual meats such as venison or duck to liven up their outdoor feast, while a third will only buy good cuts of herbed or marinated meat. Out with the old: Brits are bored with traditional barbeque fare . Another 21 per cent depend on exotic . foods and home-made salads and 34 per cent focus on presentation in an . effort to wow their guests. And, 61 per cent of Britons use marinades, some even making their own, to make their food stand out. A spokesman for Kikkoman, which . produces soy sauce and carried out the study, said: ‘There was a time . when barbecues would consist of a burnt sausage in a roll, a plain . burger with processed cheese slices and a bit of salad on the side. ‘But it seems people are being more . creative when it comes to their outdoor feasts and the traditional food . no longer makes the grade. The days of eating burnt sausages at a barbeque are over. Brits now crave more upmarket fare . ‘Rather than simply slapping a few . burgers on the coals, hosting a barbecue now means taking your time in . the kitchen to make sure you produce the tastiest food possible. ‘Hosts are now going the extra mile to . make sure their guests enjoy their food by making burgers and salads . from scratch instead of buying them ready-made, and marinating fresh . meat for hours beforehand.’ The study, of 1,000 Britons, found that . 58 per cent said they were tired of eating the same barbecue food all . the time and that nine in ten enjoyed having something different.

"By . Sam Adams . It has provided a luxurious night's sleep for 15 generations of the same aristocratic family. This antique four-poster with its ornate carved headboard was built for the residents of the Berkeley Castle estate in Gloucestershire in 1608 and has been used for more than 400 years. Far from being roped off into retirement . like many pieces of historic furniture, John Berkeley, 81, and his wife . Georgina, 73, still use the bed in the castle's Great State Bedroom. Treasured: This 400-year old bed has provided a good night's rest for 15 generations of the Berkeley family . Ornate: Its carved bed posts are thought to represent Henry, Baron Berkeley and his wife Jane . The bed was identified by retailer . Furniture Village which launched a challenge to find the piece of . furniture that has remained in continuous use by the same family the . longest. Furniture historians say the style of the bed posts date them to the period 1560 to 1640. They believe the royal arms in the middle of the headboard are those of the Stuart monarchy, dating the bed more specifically to the period after the accession of James I in 1603. It has been suggested that the male and female figures in the pedestals represent Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley, and his second wife, Jane. Georgina Berkeley said: 'Despite its great age, it is the most comfortable bed in the castle. Sleeping in such a wonderfully historic bed conveys a real feeling of British history.' The Berkeley family is recognised in British noble history for having an unbroken, identifiable male line of descent from a Saxon ancestor who lived before the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Home: Berkeley Castle, in Gloucestershire, is thought to be the longest continually inhabited private castle in England . The first feudal baron of Berkeley, . Robert Fitzharding, died in 1170 and was reputedly the grandson of . Eadnoth the Constable, a high official under King Edward the Confessor. Henry Berkeley was born in 1534 and . named after his godfather, King Henry VIII. His mother, Anne, was a . lady-in-waiting and companion of Queen Anne Boleyn, the second wife of . the king. He was a politician and became Lord Lieutenant and Vice Admiral of Gloucestershire. The bed is listed on an inventory . taken on September 20 1608 of New Park Lodge, a family property on the . Berkeley Castle estate. The grade I building is believed to be the . oldest private castle in England still inhabited by the family which . built it. The Berkeleys stay in private apartments in the castle, which is open to visitors between April and October. Charlie Harrison, marketing director . at Furniture Village, said: 'Our research revealed that, although people . pass on items of furniture to loved ones and treasured items can remain . in the family, after a few generations the stories of the original . owners become forgotten. 'What makes the Berkeley bed so . unique is that it is still used by the same family and its moment of . appearance can be accurately dated. 'Most importantly, of course, the . 400-year-old Berkeley Castle bed offers compelling evidence that nothing . beats British furniture for craftsmanship and durability.'","Bed has been used by same family for longer than any other in Britain .

"By . Laura Collins . The sister of the Indian diplomat accused keeping her maid a ‘virtual slave’ has hit out against critics’ claims that her sibling is a ‘rich elite poster girl of privilege.’ In an impassioned defence of her sister Devyani, 39, Sharmistha Khobragade has revealed: ‘She is receiving hate mails from unknown random people accusing her of ‘using slave labor’ and being a rich elite poster child of privilege.’ She said: ‘More than the public . humiliation she has been through, these accusations which attack the . very core of her value system are causing her deep pain and anguish.’ Scroll down for video . Viified as a 'rich elite poster child of privelege' but diplomat Devyani Khobragade is 'just another working mother' according to her sister Sharmistha . The Indian government reacted with outrage over the treatment of its Deputy Consul in New York who was arrested on charges of visa fraud, strip-searched and held in a cell with sex workers and drug addicts before posting $250,000 bail. But according to her sister: ‘The hate mail and the unfair accusations are far more likely to break Devyani’s spirit than anything else.’ Impassioned Defence: Dr Khobragade's sister Sharmistha has refuted claims that her sister is a 'poster child for privelege' Sharmistha broke her silence in a lengthy Facebook posting in which she rebutted the allegations made by Dr Khobragade’s maid, Sangeeta Richard. She hit back at the presentation of her sister as ‘a rich elite poster child of privilege, used to having servants at her beck and call, an exploiter and a hypocrite for talking about women’s rights.’ But Dr Khobragade’s background is certainly one of considerable comfort and academic ambition. Born and brought up in Mumbai, her father, Uttam is former magistrate and retired IAS officer and her uncle, Dr Ajay M Gondane is Indian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea. She studied medicine and qualified from the Seth GS Medical College and King Edward Memorial Hospital in Mumbai but abandoned it to enter the Indian Foreign Service in 1999. She is proficient in English, Hindi, German and her mother tongue, Marathi. But it was neither family precedent nor her own undoubted abilities that secured Dr Khobragade her place in the IFS. Instead it was the fact that she is a Dalit – or Untouchable – which allowed her entrance to the IFS on the India’s quota system for ‘Schedule Castes', according to surprising reports in India. A total of 7.5 per cent of all jobs in the IFS must go to members of Scheduled Castes. The system was established with the aim of helping social mobility in an otherwise rigid culture of cast discrimination. Dr Khobragade's treatment was raised in India's parliament, the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday when Bahiyan Samaj Party leader, Mayawati accused central government of 'reacting late' because of the diplomat's low caste. Raised in a culture where inequity is keenly felt and plainly seen, Dr Khobragade’s campaigning on issues of equality is, according to her family, neither posturing nor hypocritical but, instead, profoundly personal. Allegations of keeping her maid a 'virtual slave' have struck to the very core of Dr Khobragade's value system . Had she been used to ‘having servants at her beck and call,’ her sister claimed: ‘Devyani would have taken servants each time she was posted abroad. ‘But she did not take a servant when she was unmarried and without children. The actual fact is that Devyani is happiest when she does not have servants around.’ Today, as a working mother to two daughters, now 3 and 6, ‘this is not an option for her.’ United front: Dr Khobragade's brother, Shashank, has also posted a spirited defence of his sister . An attack on Indian sovereignty: Dr Khobragade's father, Uttam, above has described America's treatment of his daughter as an attack on his nation . Sharmistha said: ‘I am concerned with whether she (Devyani) has mistreated, defrauded or exploited another human being in any way. The answer to this is a resounding, “no.”’ She claimed that Richard was paid ‘whatever Devyani had promised her.’ She explained: ‘A sum of Rs30,000 was paid into Sangeeta’s husband’s bank account in India monthly. In addition to this, according to the $9/hour contract, Devyani paid Sangeeta several hundred dollars each month in New York, in cash at her request.’ According to Sharmistha: ‘Sangeeta had two large comfortable rooms to herself in a well-appointed apartment with all modern facilities and a separate entrance.’ She ate the same food as the family, she had ‘complete discretion in managing the house’ and was ‘allowed to pace her work as she wished.’ In a glowing account of Richard’s working conditions she added: ‘She was allowed to come and go as she pleased, having the house keys, metro pass and the option to take taxis at Devyani’s expense.’ She added: ‘We was provided with a mobile phone, had bought an iPad which she often used for Facebook and could communicate with whomever she wished whenever she wished, in India or New York.’ 'The hate mail and accusations are far more likely to break Devyani's spirit than anything else,'                         -Sharmistha Khobragade . According to Sharmistha, Richard was welcomed as a member of the family and forged a close bond with the girls for whom she largely cared. In return she left ‘without any warning or notice,’ she said, and ‘without even leaving a good-bye not for the girls who were so fond of her.’ She claimed that Dr Khobragade offered to pay for Richard’s flight back to India if she was unhappy with her role and that when ‘she faced Devyani across a negotiating table,’ Richard told her: ‘I will not go back. Why will I go back? I know that if I go back I will never be able to come back to the US.‘So who exploited whom? Who used whom?’ By her own admission Sharmistha did not witness any of the scenes she so keenly described. But, she said: ‘I know most of this from Devyani and from my father who did visit her in the November 2012- June 2013 period.’ Unjustified: Strip searches are required of all suspects in the US but it is seen as outrageous- especially for women- in India . Demonstrators in Bhopal, India burn pictures of President Obama as they protest the arrest of Devyani Khobragade . Dr Khobragade’s brother, Shashank, posted his own comment describing the ‘US behaviour as arrogant and inhuman.’ Speaking to MailOnline Dr Khobragade’s father, Uttam, revealed that he planned to travel to New York to be with his daughter. Describing the sequence of events as ‘shocking’ he said: ‘She’s a brave girl. She has not done anything wrong. I myself was a magistrate for seven years. She has not done anything that warrants her arrest.’ And though Sharmistha spoke of her sister’s sense of personal betrayal, her father insisted: ‘The whole of India feels that it is not an attack on Devyani, it is an attack on Indian sovereignty.’ Additional Reporting by James Tapper in New Delhi .","Devyani Khobragade's sister claims hate mail and allegations could break her sibling's spirit .

"By . James  Nye . It has taken them over 30 years, but the FBI have finally charged members of the New York mafia with the 1978 Lufthansa heist at JFK - made famous by the movie Goodfellas. Five high-ranking members of the Bonanno organized crime family were arrested and charged in pre-dawn raids on Thursday morning in connection with the $6 million robbery that is still one of the largest cash thefts in American history. The arrests took place across New York and included Thomas 'Tommy D' DiDiore, who is believed to be the highest ranking member of the Bonanno family outside of prison and Vincent Asaro, 78, who is alleged to be a captain, or capo in the ranks of the crime family. Scroll Down for Video . Arrest: Vincent Vinny Asaro, second from right, has been charged over the the infamous Lufthansa heist of 1978 . Charges: Vincent Asaro, an alleged captain in the Bonanno crime family, has denied allegations that he was involved in the robbert . Boss: Thomas (Tommy D) DiFiore , reportedly connected to the Bonanno crime family, is escorted by FBI agents out of a federal building in Brooklyn, New York on Thursday after being charged in connection with the Lufthansa heist of 1978 . Pinched: Two of five men arrested by the FBI this morning in connection with the infamous Lufthansa heist of 1978 leaves the court in Brooklyn . Investigation: One of the five men arrested by the FBI is escorted by agents . Tough guy: A man connected to the Bonanno crime family is escorted by FBI agents today in Brooklyn. Court papers unsealed in New York charge that the men were members of the Bonanno crime family . This is the first time any accused member of the mafia has ever faced charges in connection with the crime. The arrests of the five men follows a discovery by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of human remains at a New York property tied to James 'Jimmy the Gent' Burke last summer. Burke, the suspected mastermind of the heist, died in prison in 1996 while serving time for the murder of a drug dealer. Actor Robert De Niro played a character based on Burke in the film. Vincent Asaro, identified as one of the leaders of the Bonanno gang, was charged with the theft of $5 million in cash and $1 million in jewelry from the Lufthansa Terminal at Kennedy on December 11, 1978. At the time, it was the biggest cash heist ever in the United States. The stolen $5 million would be worth $17.9 million in 2013 dollars, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The crime stumped investigators for years, but a break in the case came last summer during a search that turned up human remains buried at the former home of Burke. The indictment charges Asaro with the murder of Paul Katz in 1969, as well as robbery, conspiracy and other charges tied to the 1978 heist. The Asaros, both alleged captains in the Bonanno organized crime family, also were charged together in a 1984 robbery of $1.25 million worth of gold salts from a Federal Express employee. Information on their attorneys was not immediately available. Iconic: The multi-million dollar heist was made famous in the 1990 film Goodfellas . Burke owned Robert's Lounge, the saloon that a fellow Lucchese associate, the late Henry Hill - played by Ray Liotta in Goodfellas - described as Burke's private cemetery. 'Jimmy buried over a dozen bodies ... under the bocce courts,' Hill wrote in his book, 'A Goodfella's Guide to New York.' Law enforcement have said that the arrested are Bonanno crime family members Vincent Asaro, 78; Jerome Asaro, 55; Thomas 'Tommy D' DiFiore, 70; John 'Bazoo' Ragano, 52; and Jack Bonventre, whose age isn't known. Two of the suspects live in Queens, two in Long Island and one in upstate New York. Life and film: James ""Jimmy the Gent"" Burke is led handcuffed from a law enforcenemt vehicle in this April 1979 file photo - and (right) as portrayed by Robert De Niro in the 1990 film Goodfellas . The exact connection between the search of Burke's home in Queens and the Lufthansa heist has not been made clear by the FBI as of Thursday. Before today the only person ever convicted in connection with the robbery was airport insider, Louis Werner - who tipped off the men who stole the money. The theft occurred in the middle of the night on December 11, 1978 and netted the robbers more than $5 million in cash and $1 million in jewels. At the time, it was the largest heist ever in America and led to a huge, decades-long search for the perpetrators that until now has been fruitless. Six masked gunman took 64 minutes to steal the packets of cash, toss them into a van and escape. The FBI has always agreed with the plot of the movie Goodfellas about all loose connections to the robbery being killed off by paranoid mob bosses. Anger: The character of Jimmy Conway - played by Robert De Niro - becomes angry in the aftermath of the Lufthansa robbery and begins to kill those associated with the heist . Iconic: The 1990 Martin Scorsese movie Goodfellas is considered by some to be one of the best movies about organized crime in modern American history . Federal agents believe that Asaro was the key mafia overseer for JFK and as such would have been informed of Burke's plan to rob the currency shipment from West Germany. The indictment charges Asaro with the murder of Paul Katz in 1969, as well as robbery, conspiracy and other charges tied to the 1978 heist. ABC News reported Katz was killed, and his remains buried, because Burke believed he was working with law enforcement. Burke was a specialist in hijacking and was arrrested in 1982 for a parole violation and was sentenced to 12 years in prison for match fixing involving the Boston College basketball team. During his prison term, Burke was indicted for the murder of a known drug dealer whose body was found tied up hanging in a freezer truck in Brooklyn. He was sentenced to 20 years to life for second-degree murder and died behind bars in 1996, at age 64, almost two decades after the airport robbery. The cash has never been recovered from the robbery.","Five suspected mobsters have been arrested for their part in the 1978 Lufthansa heist at New York's Kennedy International Airport .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Not guilty: Neville Neville walks away from Bolton Crown Court after he was cleared of sexual assault . The father of former England footballers Gary and Phil Neville has been cleared of sexually assaulting a woman. Neville Neville, 64, admitted he engaged in sexual activity with the middle-aged complainant in her car just 20 yards from his house but said it was consensual. The woman told a jury at Bolton Crown Court that Neville drunkenly forced himself upon her. Neville bowed his head as the woman foreman delivered the verdict after the jury deliberated for just under 75 minutes. He then breathed a sigh of relief and looked upwards before he mouthed 'Thank you' in the direction of the jury. After he was told he could leave the dock, he stepped out and hugged his legal team. Asked for a comment outside the courtroom, Neville said: 'I can't say anything right now. Maybe later.' His son, Gary, who cried as the verdict was delivered, stepped in and said: 'Dad, come on. He won't be saying anything.' Earlier today, his defence lawyer told the jury Neville had 'imperilled his marriage and his children's affections, trust and respect', but was not guilty of sexual assault. The jury of eight women and four men listened to closing speeches today from prosecution and defence counsel, along with Neville's two sons and his daughter, netball international Tracey, in the public gallery. The incident was alleged to have taken place in Bury, Greater Manchester in the early hours of March 23 when the middle-aged complainant offered Neville a lift home in bad weather. Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, said the case was not about 'precision of recollection' but about who was telling the truth. 'Nothing seriously has been suggested to you about why (the alleged victim) should tell a pack of lies. Nothing has been put forward by the defence as to why she should lie about it. Has she really put herself through the ordeal of this trial on the back of a pack of lies?' he said. Exit: Gary Neville (left) drives his father away from court after he was cleared of the charges . Former England footballers Gary (left) and Phil Neville (right) outside Bolton Crown Court where their father was today cleared of sexually assaulting a woman . 'There can hardly be anyone in this country who has not read a newspaper or watched television over the last few years who does not know that is very likely to be a traumatic ordeal to give evidence when one is alleged to be the victim of a sexual crime. 'If she had this consensual liaison with the defendant and then afterwards regrets it, or is even ashamed of it, the last thing she is going to do is to be talking about it. 'Is it not a remarkable coincidence that neither of them had any sexual interest in one another up until that very moment and suddenly in an instant without any preamble at all they both fall into each other's arms. A bit Mills and Boon that isn't it?' The Crown suggested that once Neville started kissing her, he could not stop and lost his self-control, Mr Cadwallader said. A combination of alcohol, opportunity and the fact that he fancied her led to him committing the offence, he said. It had been alleged Neville lunged at her, thrust his tongue down her throat, put his hand up her shirt and grabbed her breast. The complainant then said he placed his hand down her trousers and sexually assaulted her. Netball international Tracey Neville arriving with her father Neville Neville at Bolton Crown Court today . Orlando Pownall QC, defending, told the jury: 'There is nothing Mills and Boon about it. It is squalid whichever way one looks at the facts. Most, if not all, of the evidence given involves details of events that are seldom talked about in private, yet alone aired in public.' It would be natural to feel sympathy for the alleged victim but feel limited sympathy for his client, he said. 'Mr Neville, upon his own admission, did something he should never have done,' the barrister said. 'Sympathy for the Neville family and, in particular, his wife (Jill). Sympathy wherever it lies will play no part in your deliberations. For a true verdict is a dispassionate one.' Gary Neville was not called to give evidence yesterday because of his 'celebrity status', he said. 'It simply is this. He was a son, no more or less, called on behalf of his father to give in brief an account of his experience of his father,' Mr Pownall said. He asked the jury to disregard the alleged victim's comparison of Neville to Stuart Hall when it was put to her that no one else had ever made a similar complaint about the defendant. 'Contrast that with the present case,' he said. 'Not one other complaint. Not one other communication, false or otherwise, to suggest that this defendant has been involved in any similar activity before and he accepts, from the word go, he had kissed and intimately touched (the alleged victim).' He asked the jury to consider whether it was the case that the complainant bitterly regretted her actions on the night and maybe convinced herself that it was without her consent. 'This defendant has done wrong. He should never have kissed (the alleged victim). In doing so he imperilled his marriage and his children's affections, trust and respect, and he is going to have to live with that. But on a fair assessment of the evidence heard, he is not guilty of the allegation made,' Mr Pownall said.","Neville admitted engaging in sexual activity but said it was consensual .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Backyard death: Student William McCaw was found dead in a New Jersey backyard by police . A man who was already facing trial for the death of a cyclist in a hit-and-run accident has now been arrested over the death of a college student, who was found in the backyard of a New Jersey home last month. Middlesex County prosecutors say Timothy Puskas, 38, is being charged with murder for the death of William McCaw, a 22-year-old Rutgers University student who was found February 15 outside a New Brunswick home. Puskas was already looking at jail time for allegedly killing a bicyclist in a 2012 hit-and-run. Puskas was arrested on Friday in Milltown, New Jersey on charges of aggravated assault that were unrelated to McCaw's killing. Prosecutors did not elaborate on what allegedly happened between Puskas and McCaw, but a spokesman said the preliminary investigation indicated they did not know each other. Investigators believe McCaw died of blunt force trauma and killed between 3 a.m. and 9 a.m. the day after he attended a fraternity party. 'He was going from place to place, having a good time, enjoying his weekend, when he came upon the defendant,' says Assistant Prosecutor Sheree Pitch. 'When he came upon him, his weekend ended.' McCaw had no connection to the people who lived in the home, and it is not clear where he was attacked. McCaw, originally from Gallatin, Tenn., previously attended Rutgers University and would return to New Brunswick occasionally to visit friends.

"By . Helen Lawson . Michael Hall is married to Michael Caine's daughter Natasha, pictured with her father in 2002 . Michael Caine's son-in-law avoided bankruptcy today after agreeing a settlement with a man he allegedly owed £120,000. Michael Hall was being sued over a £117,000 loan Russell Teasdale claimed he was owed by the businessman. Mr Hall, who married the actor's daughter Natasha in 2007, was said to have borrowed the money from Mr Teasdale that same year to help bankroll office building projects in central London. Six years later Mr Teasdale claimed he was still owed most of the money, with Mr Hall only having repaid £3,200. Today at Kingston County Court Anna Medvinskaia, for Mr Hall, handed in an agreement - known as a consent order - to Deputy District Judge Parker. A source said: 'A consent order has been agreed because there's a settlement. The order is an agreement between the two parties involved in the case. 'Settlement agreements need to be followed through - if they are not further action can be taken. The terms of the settlement itself have not been disclosed and the consent order has not yet been published. The 30 second hearing was not attended by Mr Hall. The agreement was reached after lawyers acting for Mr Teasdale had earlier issued a statutory demand, which would have forced Mr Hall to pay up. This was countered by a set aside application by Mr Hall, in a bid to have proceedings against him halted. However in the wake of today's consent order both processes have now been stopped. Ms Medvinskaia and Suhail Nigar, for Mr Teasdale, both refused to comment on the agreement afterwards. At an earlier hearing Watson Pringle, representing Mr Hall, claimed his client agreed an oral deal with Mr Teasdale which effectively saw the debt waivered. Mr Hall borrowed money from Russell Teasdale in 2007 - the same year as his wedding to Michael and Shakira Caine's daughter Natasha, pictured in 2003 . Michael Hall did not attend the 30 second hearing at Kingston County Court today . Mr Pringle said: 'To my mind the only issue that is raised that is new was that he alleges there was an oral discussion about the debt having been assigned. 'He [Mr Hall] says that at some stage in 2012 they decided to stop the insolvent payments and work out the set-off between them.' However, Mr Nigar countered the claims, saying Mr Teasdale denied the existence of any such agreement and added that his client was 'very upset' by the suggestion that there was.","Michael Hall was said to have repaid only £3,200 of a 2007 loan from Russell Teasdale ."
"By . Daniel Miller . The Free Syrian Army has been accused of war crimes after video emerged appearing to show a group of rebels executing around 10 captured government soldiers. The disturbing clip, which has been branded 'shocking' by human rights group Amnesty International, shows the captured soldiers, some of whom appear wounded, being heaped together on the ground. They are heard pleading for their lives as they are taunted and kicked by the rebel troops who then step back and open fire. Scroll down for video . Executions: Disturbing video footage has appeared on YouTube appearing to . show Syrian rebels executing a group of government soldiers . Rebels are heard calling them 'Assad's Dogs', before firing round after round into their bodies as they lay on the ground. One rebel soldier is heard telling a prisoner: 'Do you not know that we belong to the people of this country?' The soldier replies: 'I swear in the name of God I did not fire.' Amnesty International's Ann Harrison said in a statement: 'This shocking footage depicts a potential war crime in progress, and demonstrates an utter disregard for international humanitarian law by the armed group in question.' A spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said it was examining the video. 'The . allegations are that these were soldiers who were no longer combatants . and therefore, at this point, it looks very like a war crime. Another . one,' the spokesman, Rupert Colville, told reporters in Geneva. Final moments: The soldiers are shown heaped together on the ground, begging for their lives before their captors step back and open fire . War crimes: The captured soldiers are heard pleading for their lives before being stamped on. Human rights group Amnesty International described the footage as 'shocking' 'Unfortunately this could be the latest in a string of documented summary executions by opposition factions as well as by government forces and groups affiliated with them, such as the (pro-government) shabiha militia. 'The people committing these crimes should be under no illusion that they will escape accountability, because there is a lot of accumulated evidence, perhaps including this video,' he said. The executed soldiers are believed to be among at least 153 people killed nationwide on Thursday including 72 soldiers, 43 civilians and 38 rebels, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The highway linking the capital Damascus . to the contested city of Aleppo, Syria's commercial center, has been . the scene of heavy fighting since rebels cut the road last month. Atrocity: A rebel soldier is seen talking to the camera before the executions begin . Five rebels were killed in the fighting near the city of Saraqeb in the northwest, now a key battleground after rebels seized the town of Maaret al-Numan on the Damascus-Aleppo road last month. President Bashar al-Assad's forces launched intensive air strikes this week which analysts say are a response to opposition gains and aimed at 'terrorizing' local communities. Riad Kahwaji, head of the Dubai-based Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis said:'They are trying to make the civilian population so angry and so scared that it will not be possible for the rebels to find safe havens.' On Thursday helicopter gunships attacked a district of Damascus as warplanes pounded rebel bastions in the capital's suburbs and in Edleb, the Observatory said. At least three air raids hit the northern Damascus suburb of Harasta, home to some of the rebel Free Syrian Army's best organized fighters, as on the other side of the city gunships attacked the Al-Hajar al-Aswad district. Clashes also raged in the northern commercial hub of Aleppo, the Observatory said, and elsewhere in Edleb, where FSA forces backed by the Islamist Al-Nusra Front continued their siege of the Wadi Deif army base.

The Observatory says more than 36,000 people have now been killed since the uprising broke out in March 2011 and evolved into an armed civil conflict. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned on Wednesday against efforts by Islamic extremists to 'hijack' the revolution, but the opposition SNC head said the lack of an international response to the conflict was to blame. 'The international community is responsible, through its lack of support for the Syrian people, for the growth of extremism in Syria,' its director Abdel Basset Sayda told AFP.

Wreckage: Buildings destroyed in Saif Al Dawla near Aleppo, Syria . Deep divisions over how to deal with Assad â€“ China and Russia have repeatedly used their UN Security Council vetoes to block resolutions aimed at putting more pressure on the Syrian leader â€“ have stymied international efforts to address the conflict. But China said Thursday it had made 'constructive new suggestions' to end the bloodshed, including a phased region-by-region ceasefire and the formation of a transitional government. In an apparent attempt to position China at the heart of efforts to solve the issue, the foreign ministry gave a detailed account of proposals it made to Brahimi during his visit this week. 'China's position on the Syrian issue is consistent. The new proposal is an extension of China's efforts to push forward a political resolution of the Syrian issue,' ministry spokesperson Hong Lei told a regular briefing. Brahimi, who visited Moscow and Beijing this week in a bid to revive peace efforts after a failed ceasefire during last weekend's Eid al-Adha Muslim holiday, is due to present new proposals for resolving the conflict to the Security Council later this month.","Ten government soldiers shown begging for their lives before being shot .

"By . Victoria Allen . Teacher Eppie Sprung Dawson has moved the teenager, now 18, into her home despite being on the sex offenders' register . A teacher caught having an affair with her 17-year-old pupil is now living with him in her marital home, two months after being placed on the sex offenders’ register. Eppie Sprung Dawson, 27, lost her job and her marriage after being discovered half-naked in a layby with teenager Matthew Robinson. She narrowly escaped a prison sentence and is now working behind a bar in Dumfries. But she has moved the boy she was caught with into her house, to the distress of his parents who are appealing to him to come home. Matthew, now 18, left his parents’ farmhouse last week after a row with his mother over failing to tidy his room. He is now living with his former teacher and they fear he may not return. The teenager’s mother, Sheree Robinson, said: ‘We had a normal family row about his room being untidy and he just left. He rang Eppie to come and pick him up. ‘We don’t know what she is after and what is in her mind. ‘I think the whole family are still in shock. You send your child to school and you expect them to to be safe. 'She is a sex offender - she has abused her power and her position to gain the trust of a child and to do this. ‘Given he was 17 when this happened, she should have gone to jail.’ The young teacher’s affair was exposed when they were caught together in her car following a school dance last December. The pair were half-naked when police knocked on the window and she pleaded guilty to sexual activity with a person under 18 while she was in a position of trust and his teacher. Sprung Dawson escaped being jailed at the court case in July but was ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register for six months and given a six-month community payback order. She lost her job at St Joseph’s College in Dumfries and separated from her husband of two years, Ranald Dawson, also a teacher and the son of former Solicitor General for Scotland Lord Dawson. But just minutes after appearing in the dock, Matthew’s father, Jonathan Robinson, revealed the disgraced teacher telephoned his son. The pair have stayed in close contact and she has showered the youngster with expensive Xbox computer games and rugby tops. Engineer Mr Robinson, 45, said: ‘She’s just generally keeping him there by buying him things. ‘She has got her hooks into him at the moment. She just can’t let go.’ Dawson had sex with the student after she offered to give extra help to at St Joseph's College, Dumfries . Matthew’s family fear they will become a couple, although he has insisted to his parents that they are just friends. The pair are currently living together in Sprung Dawson’s house in an upmarket area of Dumfries, which she shared with her husband before he walked out. Mrs Robinson, a mother of six, said she and her husband had begged the teacher, who they knew from parents’ evenings, to end the relationship following the trial. She said: ‘We asked her to our farmhouse to talk to her and we thought it was resolved because she said she was happy to leave him alone and it was Matthew’s choice. ‘We now know she went and rang him shortly afterwards. She didn’t do what we asked her and she was devious. It is clear she wants more out of the relationship than Matthew but he has no chance to meet a girl his own age while he is living there.’ Instead of backing off from Matthew, Mrs Sprung Dawson is said to have bombarded him with text messages and phone calls. She grew close to Matthew after giving the dyslexic schoolboy extra lessons to help him with his studies. Sprung Dawson's marriage to husband Ranald ended after the affair was revealed and the student is now living in their former marital home in Dumfries . During their secret affair, she took him to a hotel in Carlisle for a romantic trip and attended parties with his teenage friends. His parents had no suspicions and Matthew told them he was playing rugby. The first they knew was when the police turned up at their door last year. Their son, now a carpentry and joinery student at Dumfries College, has given no indication he will return home and his parents say he has become isolated from friends his own age. Mrs Sprung Dawson, who is undergoing psychosexual counselling after telling Dumfries Sheriff Court she had been molested by an older man at the age of 13, was not at home yesterday. The owner of the Slipstream bar, where she now works, said she had been given as much time off as she needed following the renewed attention over her relationship and had gone to Edinburgh. No one was available for comment at the house she shares with Matthew. The family of Matthew Robinson have said they have ‘no clue’ what to do next, and have refused to visit him at Sprung Dawson’s home. Mrs Robinson said she believed the teenager had been pursued by his teacher, adding: ‘He is a teenage boy and what teenage boy would not have done what he did? ‘We are still in shock over everything that has happened. ‘My son’s future is at stake and we feel that she has got away with it. I just hope that he comes home.’","Eppie Sprung Dawson was caught with student Matthew Robinson, then 17 .

"By . Ben Spencer . and Louise Eccles . Dr Barend Delport, pictured at an earlier hearing, has been jailed for six years for sexually assaulting and taking intimate pictures of women . A married doctor who sexually assaulted and photographed patients as young as 18 months was jailed for six years yesterday. Barend Delport, 55, a trusted GP and Christian leader, took 800 photos of women and children at his surgery for his own sexual gratification. He told his victims – who ranged from a toddler to a woman in her 60s – a raft of lies, even claiming he needed the images for training purposes. Judge Philip Statman, sentencing  Delport yesterday at Maidstone Crown Court, said it was difficult to imagine ‘a graver breach of trust’. The doctor carried out the abuse between 2003 and 2012, assaulting numerous victims. The court was given details of only six – three women and three girls aged 14, four and 18 months – who he sexually assaulted at his surgery in Swanley, Kent. The South African-born doctor was caught only after a mother asked why her young daughter had been intimately examined and photographed by Delport when she had only complained of a stomach ache. When police received the complaint in March, a letter was sent to every patient at The Oaks surgery urging them to get in touch if they had concerns. It provoked a string of similar allegations. Shortly after his arrest, Delport resigned from the surgery and  left the £500,000 three-bedroom home he shared with his wife  Sally in the village of Eynsford,  near Sevenoaks. Mrs Delport, who is a 54-year-old jewellery maker, is said to ‘remain committed’ to her husband, although they have separated. Anthony Haycroft, prosecuting, said Delport concocted a string of excuses to justify taking pictures of his victims. He claimed to be a dermatologist when taking intimate pictures of a child suffering from a skin complaint, the prosecutor said. He also took photographs of women telling them he was  building a case against the midwives at Darent Valley Hospital who he falsely accused of failures of care. When he was arrested police found 500,000 images on  his computer. Of those, more than 5,500 were pornographic and 842 were of patients he had taken himself. Photographic consent forms were also seized in which patients had agreed to being photographed  during their examinations. ‘The mothers of the child victims all feel totally and understandably abused,’ said Mr Haycroft. ‘They have feelings of guilt and they have lost trust in doctors completely.’ Abuser:  Many of the patients allowed themselves to be photographed because they trusted Delport as their doctor . Delport admitted 26 offences, including four indecent assaults on adults and three indecent assaults on children. He . also admitted two counts  of possessing indecent images of children, . five of making indecent images of children and 12 of taking indecent . images. Delport accepted two . further charges of indecent assault yesterday – against a victim who . came forward following his last court hearing – and asked for them to be . taken into consideration. Michael . Haynes, representing Delport, said the GP’s shame was ‘overwhelming’ and that he had  let down his wife, friends, patients and church. Delport had sought treatment for his 'addiction to pornography', his defence said . Since his arrest Delport has sought treatment for his ‘addiction to pornography’. At . the time of his arrest, he was presiding over Sunday service at . Eynsford Baptist Church following the departure of the minister. A . source told the Mail: ‘People trusted him with their lives to guide . them and give them advice when, all along, he was a paedophile. ‘He believed God would talk to him directly about what was wrong with a patient. ‘No one can believe what was actually going on. It is shocking.’ Friends said Delport earned more than £100,000 a year and enjoyed spending his money on golfing holidays, clothes and gadgets.","Barend Delport , 55, was caged for six years for the photographs .

"By . Chris Pleasance . New 3D images of Pablo Picasso have been discovered nearly six decades after they were first taken. These three pairs of images, which appear in three dimensions when seen through a special viewer or glasses, were taken by French photographer Robert Mouzillat in 1957. In the photographs - taken at the height of Picasso's fame - the artist poses in his Cannes house in a stetson, and holds a cigarette and a drink in his cluttered studio. The never-before-seen pictures of Picasso were taken by Robert Mouzillat - the inventor of the 3D camera - in 1957 at the height of the artist's fame . Mouzillat invented the 3D camera, which uses two lenses to take pairs of pictures from slightly different angles, and chose the 75-year-old Picasso for one of his first projects. In order to view them in 3D, viewers are supposed to focus on a point halfway between their face and the picture, bringing the two photos together in the centre. Included in the collection of images are Picasso's biographer John Richardson, poet Jean Cocteau, surrealist artist Jaime Sabartes and Picasso's wife Jacqueline Rocque. His pets, including Lump the dachshund, Yan the boxer and Esmerelda the goat, are also pictured. The camera uses two lenses to take pictures from slightly different angles, and can be viewed in 3D by 'defocusing' your eyes so the two pictures appear as one image in the centre . The pictures were discovered by Anthony Sturgis, the director of the Holburne Museum in Bath, where the photographs will go on display. He was invited to Jersey by Mouzillat's daughter Elizabeth Mouzillat Jowett to view 100,000 images stored on the archives there. Among pictures of monuments, French landscapes, nudes, and the inside of the ElysÃ©e Palace, he spotted the images of Picasso. Included in the collection, which is to go on display in Bath, are images of Picasso's studio (pictured), his wife and several of his beloved pets - including Esmeralda the goat . Speaking to the Guardian, Sturgis said: 'It is not every day that one finds a group of photographs of Picasso that no one has seen before.' Among his favourites were the ones of Picasso's studio. He added: 'It really is rather amazing. They are my favourite images. You get a sense of the space and the room and this mix of his art, other people's art and then just clutter... rubbish.'

"By . Steve Nolan . Notorious child killer Roy Whiting was stabbed in the eye in his prison cell by a double murderer because he was a 'dirty little nonce'. Newcastle Crown Court heard how Whiting, a convicted sex offender who was given a life sentence in 2001 for the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne, was stabbed by powerfully-built Gary Vinter, 42 because he wanted to change his jail conditions at Wakefield prison, West Yorkshire. Double murderer Vinter picked a high profile target for the attack, which took place last July, to further his cause. Attack: Gary Vinter, left, was jailed for an additional five years for stabbing child-killer Roy Whiting, right, in both eyes at Wakefield Prison last July . He was jailed for a further five years for the attack from which Whiting made a full recovery. After hearing Andrew Kershaw, prosecuting, give an explanation for the gruesome attack, Vinter, who was appearing via videolink from Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, said: 'He was a dirty little nonce. That’s why I did it.' Vinter, from Middlesbrough, sneaked into Whiting’s cell and used a sharpened plastic toilet brush handle to stab Whiting in both eyes. Mr Kershaw said: 'On the second stabbing the tip of the weapon broke leaving a piece of plastic in this victim’s eye socket.' Vinter then kicked and punched Whiting as he lay on the floor, before leaving the cell. The double murderer later told prison authorities 'the only reason Whiting was still alive is he got tired during the attack,' added Mr Kershaw. There was no evidence of any previous animosity between the two, who had only been on the same wing at Wakefield Prison for a few days. Jail: Roy Whiting was stabbed at Wakefield Prison, pictured, in July last year . But Vinter, who is serving a life sentence after murdering a workmate in 1996 and his estranged wife in 2008, picked out Whiting for his notoriety, the court heard. Mr Kershaw said: 'It was a cold-blooded premeditated attack intending to maim at least. 'It was calculated to manipulate the prison authorities into changing the conditions under which he was detained.' He told officers he had tried to kill Whiting, that as a 'natural life' prisoner he had no hope and he had warned the authorities he would target a 'high-profiler'. In a statement read out in court, Whiting said: 'I was immediately punched and hit to the right eye and nose area and it made me stagger into the cell wall. 'I then felt a second punch or blow to the left side. 'Following the second blow I was aware of a severe pain in my eye and my vision was now blurred in my left eye. 'I slid down the walls to the floor and I raised my arms to defend myself but felt further kicks and punches.' Whiting was treated at Pinderfields Hospital where he received stitches in his eye lids and the shard of plastic was removed. Despite three months of blurred vision in his left eye, Whiting has made a full recovery apart from some numbness to the area. Vinter admitted wounding with intent at a previous hearing and was given an indefinite sentence, with a notional minimum term of five years. Treatment: Whiting made a full recovery after being treated at Pinderfields Hospital, pictured . Mr Justice Openshaw said Vinter chose his victim because he was a 'notorious child murderer' and an aggravating factor of the offence was Whiting’s vulnerability. He added: 'There is no regret or remorse, on the contrary, the defendant derived and continues to derive considerable satisfaction from having committed this offence.' After sentencing Vinter said: 'Thank you very much judge, it has been a pleasure.' Vinter is appealing against his full life term before European Human Rights judges at the end of this month. In 1996 Vinter was jailed for life for murdering Carl Edon, 22, a railway signalman. He was released from prison in 2006 after serving a 10-year minimum term but was recalled to prison for his part in a pub brawl and then went on to murder his wife Anne White, 40, in a chilling offence four years ago. He had followed her around Middlesbrough pubs, then had her kidnapped to his mother’s house where he stabbed her to death having failed in his attempt to strangle her.","Roy Whiting was stabbed by powerfully-built Gary Vinter at Wakefield Prison last July .

"By . Sam Webb . Blair said said militant Islamist ideology had created an enemy that was 'insidious and venomous, but also difficult to beat' Tony Blair has said religion needs to be put 'in its proper place in politics' in order to defeat terrorists who 'fight without hesitation, kill without mercy and die without regret'. Speaking from outside the United Nations' headquarters in New York, the former prime minister and current envoy to the Middle East said Islamist ideology had created an enemy that was 'insidious and venomous, but also difficult to beat'. And he called for the 'basic long-term problem of extremism based on a perversion of religion' to be confronted following the Westgate mall massacre in Kenya, deadly attacks on Christians in Pakistan and the conflagrations in the Middle East. He told Sky News: 'We need to realise that unless we are educating people to a tolerant and respectful and open-minded approach to the world, then this cancer of terrorist groups will continue. 'The thing about these people is that they fight without hesitation, they kill without mercy and they die without regret.' Asked if he had hoped for an end to al Qaeda after the death of Osama Bin Laden, he said: 'No because it doesn't put an end to the ideology. 'I think it's right that it happened and it will have had a certain impact and it shows that if you organise these terrorist attacks in the end the long arm of the law will ultimately come out and get you. 'But this is a vibrant ideology that stretches quite deep, I'm afraid, in certain countries. 'If you look at the Middle East right now, if you took out this toxic abuse of religion, all these situations would be easier to deal with. 'One of the things I work on now and I am very passionate about is the need to put religion in its proper place in politics and also to encourage people who are religious to be tolerant and respectful of those who have a different faith from theirs. The former British Prime Minister said terrorist groups such as the Al-Shabaab Islamist Movement will eventually fall foul of justice . 'This is deep and this ideology is being pushed out from the Middle East but elsewhere now, right across the world, and we are a long way from beating it I'm afraid.' Mr Blair was speaking after it was announced that Britain, the U.S., Russia, France and China may be edging closer to a United Nations Security Council resolution designed to rid Syria of its chemical weapons. He welcomed the possibility of an agreement on chemical weapons without the need for military intervention, but warned that a 'threat of firm action from the West' to bring the fighting in Syria to an end would still be needed. Blair warned that a 'threat of firm action from the West' was needed to end the crisis in Syria . 'Unless we do that Syria, will continue disintegrating and the implications for the region are huge and the implications for us are huge as well by the way,' he said. The was a risk that the country could be effectively partitioned with President Bashar Assad and minority groups on one side and an 'extremist-dominated eastern hinterland'. 'That would be a disaster for everyone,' he said. Finally asked about revelations that Gordon Brown's former spin doctor Damian McBride had briefed against members of his own party, Mr Blair declined to comment. 'Here in the United Nations it all seems a long, long time ago and a long way away,' he said.","Former PM called extreme Islamist ideology 'insidious and venomous'

"UPDATED: . 13:40 EST, 26 August 2011 . About half of both men and women in the U.S. will be obese by 2030 if current trends continue, health experts warned today. Obesity is fast replacing tobacco as the single most important preventable cause of chronic non-communicable diseases, and will add an extra 7.8million cases of diabetes, 6.8million cases of heart disease and stroke, and 539,000 cases of cancer in the U.S. within the next two decades. Some 32 per cent of men and 35 per cent of women are now obese in the U.S., according to a research team led by Claire Wang at the Mailman School of Public Health in Columbia University in New York. Epidemic: Approximately 32 per cent of men and 35 percent of women are now obese in the U.S. They published their findings in a special series of four papers on obesity in The Lancet. The findings showed Obesity is most widespread in the UK and the U.S. among the world's leading economies. In Britain, obesity rates will balloon to between 41-48 per cent for men and 35-43 per cent for women by 2030 from what is now 26 per cent for both sexes, they warned. 'An extra 668,000 cases of diabetes, 461,000 of heart disease and 130,000 cancer cases would result,' they wrote. Due to overeating and insufficient exercise, obesity is now a growing problem everywhere and experts are warning about its ripple effects on health and healthcare spending. Obesity raises the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, various cancers, hypertension, high cholesterol, among others. Because of obesity, the U.S. can expect to spend an extra 2.6 per cent on its overall healthcare bill, or $66billion per year, while Britain's bill will grow by two per cent, or 2billion per year, Wang and colleagues warned. Health risks: Obesity raises the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, various cancers, hypertension and high cholesterol . In Japan and China, one in 20 women is obese, compared with one in 10 in the Netherlands, one in four in Australia and seven in 10 in Tonga, according to another paper led by Boyd Swinburn and Gary Sacks of the WHO Collaborating Center for Obesity Prevention at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia. Worldwide, around 1.5billion adults are overweight and a further 0.5billion are obese, with 170million children classified as overweight or obese. Obesity takes up between two to six per cent of healthcare costs in many countries. 'Increased supply of cheap, tasty, energy-dense food, improved food distribution and marketing, and the strong economic forces driving consumption and growth are the key drivers of the obesity epidemic,' Swinburn and Sacks wrote. The health experts urged governments to lead the fight in reversing the obesity epidemic. 'These include taxes on unhealthy food and drink (such as sugar sweetened beverages) and restrictions on food and beverage TV advertising to children,' wrote a team led by Steven Gortmaker at the Harvard School of Public Health, which published the fourth paper in the series.","By 2030 the number of obese Americans could increase from 99million in 2008 to 164million .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An American woman has ditched her comfortable, fun-loving Californian lifestyle to become a traditional housewife in rural India. Adriana Peral, 41, took a leap of faith last August when she flew to the sub continent to meet a man young enough to be her son who she had fallen in love with over Facebook. Within months she was married to Mukesh Kumar, 25, and had assumed her new role as a doting housewife - sweeping, cooking, cleaning and mucking in on the family's farm in an impoverished rural community in Haryana, India. Scroll down for video . Transformation: Adriana Peral, seen at a nightclub in Merced, California, left, swapped parties for a quieter life in India after travelling to the subcontinent to marry a man she met on Facebook . It is a far cry from sun-kissed, body-conscious California, where Mrs Kumar enjoyed clubbing with friends, hitting the gym and shopping with daughter Lucy. But despite the radical lifestyle change, she insists she is happier than ever. The former receptionist at an acupuncture centre said: 'I love my life here with Mukesh - I wouldn't exchange it for anything in the world.' In love: Adriana Peral, 41, and her husband Mukesh Kumar, 25, met and fell in love online . Rural: The pace of life in the remote rural village of Panipat, India, is a far cry from the modern homelife Adriana Peral, left behind in California . Home comforts: Adriana Peral makes some tea for her husband and in-laws, left, and sweeps the courtyard , right, at her house in a village in Panipat, India, during a typical day as a housewife . Mrs Kumar - who admits she had plenty of . relationships back in the U.S., but had never found true love - began . talking with Mukesh, sixteen years her junior, on the social networking . site in February. Over the next few months the pair grew closer, until one evening Mukesh unexpectedly called. She explained: 'Mukesh declared his love to me right there and then on the . phone. I didn't know how to react, and at first just laughed it off. 'But . after we talked some more, I realised he was serious and so I said if . you win my heart, I will consider marrying you. We spoke for around . three more weeks and it was during that time I decided I wanted to move . to India to be with him.' Change of pace: Adriana Peral stands beside a cow at the front yard of her house in a village in Panipat, India, as she gets used to a rural existance . Culture shock: Adriana Peral stands in front of house old Californian home, left, and outside the bed room of her house in a village in Panipat, India, right . Leaving behind her 25-year-old . daughter Lucy Cortez was a heart-wrenching moment, with many friends and . family fearing for her safety in India. Mrs Kumar, . whose parents moved to the U.S. from Mexico, said: 'When I walked in . and told everyone I had decided to leave and move to India, they were in . complete shock. 'My daughter was crying, she was in floods of tears. She was worried something bad would happen to me. 'She said India was unsafe for women. I had to turn to her and reassure her everything would be alright. Hard work: Adriana Peral has left the creature comforts of an electronic dishwasher behind as she does the dishes by hand at her house in a village in Panipat, India, . Youthful: A young Adriana Peral, suns herself on a beach in Merced, California . 'Some people thought Mukesh was a . fake, an online scam and that he didn't really exist. I can't describe . the moment I finally saw him at the arrivals gate at Indira Gandhi . airport - it was a big relief to finally see him in person.' But she admits nothing had prepared her for the culture shock she was about to experience. Her new home was a modest farm house in Popran, a large village over 30 minutes drive from the nearest town. Mrs Kumar found the family used cow pat cakes, made by drying out the excrement of the families herd, as fuel. And . with no inside toilet, a bucket for a shower and cows roaming around . the communal area, the lack of amenities was tough to adapt to. Day to day: Adriana Peral gets on with the chores at home in her new front yard - a far cry from the Californian house . Home from home: Adriana Peral, pictured with her husband Mukesh Kumar while enjoying their lunch at their house in a village in Panipat, India, says she has no regrets about leaving California . She added: 'When I first stepped off the plane it was a complete culture shock. 'It is stricter here - women have to cover up more. 'In . Haryana many people live off the land, there are few basic amenities. We cook on a stove which is outside, and my living room doubles as the . place where we store the cows at night. 'We . sometimes use the bull and cart to ride around, and the toilet is a . communal one. The shower is just a bucket in a closet sized room with a . hole in the floor. 'If people back home could see where I am living they would think I am crazy. 'At first it was a real struggle, but soon you realise you don't need a fancy toilet or power shower to be happy.' One of the biggest challenges, says Adriana, was being accepted among the largely impoverished locals. Then and now: Adriana Peral, pictured during her younger days in Merced, California, left, now lives in a remote rural village in India, where she has adopted the lifestyle of a traditional Indian housewife, right . Family: Adriana Peral and her mother-in-law Bimla Devi share a moment together at the front yard of their house in a village in Panipat, India . Home: Adriana Peral shares this home in a village in Panipat, India, with husband Mukesh Kumar . Mrs Kumar, who immediately ditched her . favoured high heels and adopted sandals, saree and headdress, said: . 'Foreigners are rarely seen in the villages here, and wherever I went a . crowd would develop all wanting to catch a glimpse of this outsider. 'Over time I began to get used to it. It was a bit like being a celebrity, but they have accepted me as one of their own now. 'A . big part of that was dressing like they do and trying to speak some . Hindi. In the U.S. I loved wearing high heels and dressing up for a night . out at a club with my friends, but here things are more low key. 'You . can't get any of the make-up I'm used to using and women generally . don't apply much of it anyway, it is an unnecessary cost. 'The locals respond when you try and fit in and live as they live.' In . November 2013 Mukesh and Adriana tied the knot in a traditional Hindu . ceremony, which made headlines in India's national Hindi language media. The event was a major . occasion within the conservative community too - where women are still . often expected to be doting housewives upon marriage and normally wed . within their own religion and caste. Culture: Adriana Peral and Mukesh Kumar celebrate their wedding in Panipat, India, in traditional style . Bull power: Adriana Peral and her husband Mukesh Kumar enjoy a buffalo cart ride through the fields near their village in rural India . Leg power: Adriana Peral, works out in the gym in Merced, California . Mukesh, who speaks broken English, but is learning from his new wife, said: 'Adriana is a good wife. 'She is always doing housework and if my mum is doing dishes she say, ""No, I want to do - it is my job"". 'I am very happy to marry with her. It is true love.' Crucially for Mrs Kumar, her mother-in-law Bimla Devi, 70, has given the pair her blessings - and even endorsed her housewife skills. Speaking in Hindi, Bimla said: 'I am happy my son married a foreigner. She respects me. If he had married a girl from our village, she would probably not have respected me as much as Adriana does. 'She works all the house too, I like her a lot.' Bedtime reading: A hindi version of The Bible is seen along with some traditional make-up items at Adriana Peral and Mukesh Kumar's bedroom . The couple now plan to have children together and build a family in India, but Adriana isn't ruling out returning to the US one day. She said: 'I am actually planning to have children with Mukesh and my mother-in-law even wants me to have two. 'I get on really well with all the family, Mukesh's brothers and sisters, his uncles - they have all taken me to their hearts. 'If I could bring the American food and luxuries here it would be perfect. But one day we would like to return to America with our family.

"By . Wills Robinson . A young Chinese woman has become the focus of an online hate campaign in China after she jokingly posted images of herself boiling a cat and using the remains to make soup. Li Jinbang's uploaded the disturbing pictures of her killing her friend's pet to Weibo, the Chinese version of Facebook. But she quickly began receiving hate mail and threats from fellow users, and before she could delete the post, the images went viral. Cruel: The woman, who lives in China's Guangdong province, posted the photos of the cat trapped in a cage before she cruelly boiled it and used the parts to make a soup . Initially, the woman just wrote: 'Hey look, I managed to catch a tiger and ate it.' But she subsequently posted the pictures and explained how she had boiled the animal before stripping its fur and cutting it to pieces. The images included the defenceless cat cowering in a cage before it was hung up, prior to being butchered. It also showed the young woman wearing a . fur coat and glasses while she prepared the soup. After being bombarded with emails, . including hate messages, she tried to defend herself by saying  the cat, which in the images looked perfectly healthy prior to . being boiled, had been badly injured in a car accident and she was . simply doing a friend a favour by putting it out of its misery. She said: 'It was a perfectly lawful killing and I killed the cat and ate it without doing anything illegal.' Some users pointed out it was no surprise she was from southeast Chinaâ€™s Guangdong . province, which is famous for its exotic eating . habits, which often include unusual animal dishes. Targeted: Li Jinbang received hate mail after the disturbing images spread over the internet after she uploaded them to social network site Weibo . China officially frowns on the process of eating cats, but estimated around 4million are eaten in the country each year. In 2012, authorities drafted legislation to make the eating of cats and dogs illegal with jail sentences of up to 15 days for offenders. But privately officials admit that the number of cats eaten is rising each year. Cowering: The young woman tried to defend herself by saying the cat, which in the images looked perfectly healthy, had been badly injured in a car accident . Authorities in China have considered making the practice of killing and eating cats illegal for many years. The legislation would have seen large fines and jail sentences handed out to those caught cooking the animals. But restaurants in certain parts of the country still serve it up as a delicacy. Overseas visitors to China rarely come . across cooked cat, as it is mainly the fringe areas in cities and rural . areas where it is popular. In both Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, cat flesh is regarded as a good winter dish as it is believed to be capable of keeping the body warm during the cold winter months. Some chefs have also claimed it is good for metabolism and helps those who eat it sweat in the summer. Most parts of the cat are said to be edible including the feet which are used to make a special type of meat soup. The head is rarely used. Cat meat is also used in the traditional 'dragon, tiger, phoenix' dish where the dragon is snake meat, the tiger is cat and the Phoenix chicken. It is especially popular as a dish for cleansing the body.","Li Jinbang, from Guandong province, uploaded images on social media .

"By . Associated Press . The family of a brain-dead, pregnant Texas woman says she has been removed from life support following a judge's ruling that a Fort Worth hospital was misapplying state law in the case. A statement sent by lawyers for the husband of Marlisa Munoz on Sunday afternoon says she was disconnected from life support about 11:30am. It says her body was released to her husband, Erick Munoz, and that the family is now looking to lay her to rest. Mother: Marlise Munoz was already a mother of one. She was a few months pregnant when she suffered a blood clot and went brain dead . A judge had given John Peter Smith . Hospital in Fort Worth hospital until 5pm Monday to comply with his . ruling to remove Marlisa Munoz from life support, which Erick Munoz . says is what his wife would have wanted. J.R. Labbe, a hospital spokeswoman, issued a statement earlier Sunday saying the hospital would follow the order. She was 14 weeks pregnant when her husband found her unconscious November 26, possibly due to a blood clot. Both . the hospital and family agreed before Wallace's ruling that Marlise . Munoz meets the criteria to be considered brain-dead - which means she . is dead both medically and under Texas law - and that her fetus, at . about 23 weeks, could not be born alive this early in pregnancy. Her attorneys revealed last week that the fetus was not developing normally, after being deprived of oxygen. What she would have wanted: Husband Erik Munoz says his wife wouldn't have wanted to keep living in her condition . Tense weeks: Erick Munoz stands with a photograph of himself, left, with wife Marlise and their son Mateo, in Haltom City, Texas. Marlise was removed from life support on Sunday after the family's high profile fight to let the pregnant woman die . 'According to the medical records we have been provided, the fetus is distinctly abnormal,' the attorneys said. 'Even at this early stage, the lower extremities are deformed to the extent that the gender cannot be determined.' The attorneys said the fetus also has fluid building up inside the skull and possibly has a heart problem. The . case has raised questions about end-of-life care and whether a pregnant . woman who is considered legally and medically dead should be kept on . life support for the sake of a fetus. It also has garnered attention on . both sides of the abortion debate, with anti-abortion groups arguing . Munoz's fetus deserves a chance to be born. Erick . Munoz and his wife are both paramedics familiar with end-of-life issues . and knew they did not want to be kept alive by machines in this type of . situation. Munoz described . in a signed affidavit Thursday what it was like to see his wife now: her . glassy, 'soulless' eyes; and the smell of her perfume replaced by what . he knows to be the smell of death. He said he tried to hold her hand but . can't. 'Her limbs have . become so stiff and rigid due to her deteriorating condition that now, . when I move her hands, her bones crack, and her legs are nothing more . than dead weight,' Munoz said. But . the hospital argued it was bound by Texas law that says life-sustaining . treatment cannot be withdrawn from a pregnant patient, regardless of . her end-of-life wishes. Unborn: The couple is pictured here with their first son Matteo . Legal . experts interviewed by The Associated Press have said the hospital was . misreading the law and that the law doesn't have an absolute command to . keep someone like Munoz on life support. Larry . Thompson, a state's attorney arguing on behalf of the hospital Friday, . said the hospital was trying to protect the rights of the fetus as it . believed Texas law instructed it to do. 'There is a life involved, and the life is the unborn child,' Thompson said. But on Sunday, the hospital said it would respect the judge's order and back down. 'The . past eight weeks have been difficult for the Munoz family, the . caregivers and the entire Tarrant County community, which found itself . involved in a sad situation,' the hospital's statement says. 'JPS Health . Network has followed what we believed were the demands of a state . statute.' Filing suit: Erick Munoz filed suit against John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas to force the hospital to remove the life support keeping his pregnant brain dead wife alive . Support: Autumn Brackeen, left, and Afton Brown, right, both of Fort Worth, Texas show their support for the Munoz family outside the Tim Curry Criminal Justice Center on Friday.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . UKIP supporters are cousins of the Tory party ‘and we want them back’, a former Conservative minister has declared. Ex-chief whip Andrew Mitchell also hit out at the European Union as a ‘supranational organisation’ unable to respond to British needs. But he sought to reach out to people who have backed UKIP, in stark contrast to previous attacks launched by senior Tories dismissing them as fruitcakes, racists or clowns. Appeal: Former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell reached out to voters who have switched to UKIP . Ahead of the Conservative conference in Manchester, party strategists are increasingly anxious about how to win back voters who have switched to the UK Independence Party. In the latest YouGov poll Labour has a nine-point lead over the Tories, but 11 per cent say they will back UKIP. UKIP leader Nigel Farage predicts his party will win next year’s European Parliament elections before winning their first seats in the Commons in 2010. Mr Mitchell, who is tipped for a return to government in the forthcoming reshuffle, hinted at a new Tory attempt to reach out disaffected voters who have defected to UKIP. ‘They are mostly our cousins and we want them back,’ he told the New Statesman. The remark strikes a more conciliatory tone than the outright attacks launched by senior Conservatives in the past. UKIP leader Nigel Farage (left) said Godfrey Bloom had made the right decision to quit as a UKIP MEP . Most famously, in 2006 David Cameron . declared: ‘UKIP is sort of a bunch of ... fruit cakes and loonies and . closet racists mostly.’ Ahead . of local elections this year, Tory minister Ken Clarke suggested UKIP . were ‘a collection of clowns or indignant, angry people’. Attempts . by Mr Farage to present a more professional image for his party have . been hampered by the outlandish behaviour of some of his members. MEP . Godfrey Bloom this week he announced he would not represent UKIP in the . European Parliament after repeatedly embarrassing the leadership. A row has erupted over attempts by the main political parties to exclude UKIP from TV leaders' debates. Ed Miliband yesterday challenged David Cameron to sign up to TV debates at the next election. The . Labour leader told the Prime Minister to 'stop ducking and diving' and . agree to repeat the live broadcasts first seen during the 2010 campaign. But Mr . Miliband ruled out the idea of UKIP leader Nigel Farage being given a . place insisting it should be the same format as last time, with Lib . Dems, Labour and Tories represented. In response, Mr Farage said: 'Ed Miliband was all for UKIP being involved in televised debates until he woke up to the fact that we take votes from all over the political spectrum.' Things reached a head when he called described UKIP members at an event promoting women in politics ‘sluts’ before hitting a TV report over the head. Mr Farage hit the roof as the farcical antics overshadowed UKIPs annual conference in central London. Mr Cameron has sought to tackle the threat posed by UKIP by promising an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU by 2017. A future Tory government would seek negotiate a ‘fresh settlement’ with Brussels before holding the vote. Asked which powers he would like to see clawed back from the EU, Mr Mitchell said: ‘There are areas where national governments are better at responding to the wishes of those they serve than a supranational organisation can be. ‘We should discuss the repatriation of these powers with our colleagues in other national parliaments and try to reach a common understanding with other national politicians.’ Mr Mitchell was forced to resign last year after he was accused of launching a foul-mouthed rant at police officers guarding Downing Street as he asked to cycle through the main gates. Pressure intensified a police log of the incident emerged, which claimed he called officers ‘plebs’ and swore at them repeatedly for making him walk through a side gate. He insisted he did not use the words attributed to him, and later said he was the victim of a deliberate attempt to ‘toxify’ the Tories and ruin his career. This week eight people including five police officers arrested as part of the heavily criticised investigation were re-bailed until late October. They include five constables from the Diplomatic Protection Group, which is responsible for guarding politicians and foreign dignitaries, one of whom, a 46-year-old woman, was present when the row happened. Two of the officers - the woman and a man who is also 46 - were arrested over alleged leaks to the media about what happened. The members of police staff are two women aged 46 and 49 who were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, and a 23-year-old man who was held in December.","Ex-chief whip reaches out to people who have switched to UKIP .

"By . Jaya Narain . and Louise Eccles . On trial: Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell smoking a cigarette outside Manchester Crown Court yesterday, which heard he was a drunk and a 'weak man' but not a child rapist . Michael Le Vell might be a weak and stupid alcoholic but he did not rape a girl from the age of six, his lawyers said yesterday. A trial was told the Coronation Street actor’s drinking problems were being used against him in a ‘prosecution by cliché’. But Eleanor Laws QC, for the Crown, insisted the soap star had committed the offences  ‘in drink’. She told the jury to dismiss the idea the 48-year-old was the subject of a witch hunt amid a welter of prosecutions of celebrities. And she said the alleged victim had nothing to gain by ‘quite literally destroying the life’ of an innocent man. ‘No one likes to think someone they liked or admired has done anything like this,’ Miss Laws added. ‘These offences are not committed by one obvious type of person. They are committed by individuals who are loved by their friends, who have no idea what is going on.’ Barristers yesterday delivered their final speeches to the jury of eight women and four men at the end of the six-day trial at Manchester Crown Court. Le Vell, who has played garage mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV soap for 30 years and is being tried under his real name Michael Turner, denies five counts of rape, three of indecent assault and four relating to sexual activity with a child. Closing speech: Prosecution barrister Eleanor Laws QC (left) urged the jury as they retired yesterday to find the actor guilty, as he watched on from the dock (right) Defence: Barrister Alisdair Williamson told the eight women and four men 'the only right thing to do is not guilty' Alisdair Williamson, defending, told . the jury Le Vell should not be found guilty just because he was ‘weak, . inadequate and a drunk’. ‘This . has been prosecution by cliché,’ he added. ‘Mr Turner drinks a lot, he . has his demons. What’s that supposed to mean? He has troubles. What’s . that supposed to mean? That’s all the Crown can come up with for a . motive.’ He said the . evidence put forward by the girl was ‘inconsistent’ and lacked detail . and was at times ‘incoherent and unbelievable’. Arguments: Michael Le Vell's legal team admitted he was troubled and had 'demons' but added this did not make him a sex offender . Going home: The actor, 48, was swept away by car yesterday as the jury began its deliberations . He . said that there was no physical evidence to back up the victim’s . claims: ‘There’s an agonising lack of detail from this witness. She . can’t give you details because it did not happen and that’s why her . story varies according to who she’s talking to.’ He . dismissed prosecution assertions that, as an actor, Le Vell had been . putting on a  performance in court: ‘Did you think he was acting? ‘Or . was his evidence the scared and frightened evidence of a man who faces . the most unbelievable and terrible thing ever to happen to a man – a . girl saying he raped her?’ Famous face: Coronation Street actor Le Vell exits Manchester Crown Court as a minder helps him through the crowd of photographers outside . He . said no child pornography was found on Le Vell’s computer, no adults . had been uneasy having their children around him and he had no criminal . convictions. He told the . jury that if they found the actor guilty they were ‘going to take a . man’s life away from him’ and cast him into the ‘outer darkness’. ‘Nothing . in this case has taken you anywhere near the level of certainty that . you would need so that you can look in the mirror in the days that come . and say, “I was sure”,’ he said. The jury has retired to consider its verdicts. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Actor denies 12 sex offences against a .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A person with access to a gun is three times more likely to commit suicide and nearly twice as likely to be a murder victim as someone who does not have access, a new study warns. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, drew the conclusion after analysing 15 studies about the relationship between gun ownership and violence. Men and women, they found, are affected in different ways. A University of California study has shown that having a gun in the home can greatly increase murder and suicide rates . When firearms were accessible, men were nearly four times more likely to commit suicide than when firearms were not accessible, while women were almost three times more likely to be victims of homicide. Gun ownership in America is higher than anywhere else in the world and firearms cause an estimated 31,000 deaths each year. Lead researcher and U.S. Army veteran Dr Andrew Anglemyer believes that the more access to weapons people have, the more violent society becomes. Gun ownership in the U.S. is higher than any other country in the world . He said: ‘Our analysis shows that having access to firearms is a significant risk factor for men committing suicide and for women being victims of homicide. Since empirical data suggest that most victims of homicide know their assailants, the higher risk for women strongly indicates domestic violence.’ Firearms play a significant role in both suicide and homicide, accounting for slightly more than half of all suicide deaths and two-thirds of homicide deaths, according to 2009 data from the 16-state National Violent Death Reporting System, which is run by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 75 per cent of suicides occur in the victims' homes, and a similar percentage of female homicide victims die in their homes. The figure is about 45 per cent for men. All but two of the studies were done in the United States and the results of the UCSF study was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. David Hemenway of the Harvard School of Public Health, in an Annals editorial accompanying the feature on the study, underlined the dangers of having a gun in the home. He wrote: ‘Why having a gun in the home would substantially increase the risk for being murdered by a person who is not a family member is uncertain, and Anglemyer and colleagues do not provide an explanation. ‘Obtaining a firearm not only endangers those living in the home but also imposes substantial costs on the community.’ There are 31,000 deaths from firearms a year in the U.S (pictured is a gun shop in Kennewick, Washington) The Smith & Wesson's new monster handgun . The study on gun violence was released shortly after Smith & Wesson unveiled its new monster handgun - the so-called 'Backpack Cannon'. It's a .460-caliber revolver clearly built for those looking to tap into their inner Clint Eastwood or Hellboy. Smith & Wesson claim that it's the ideal gun for carrying around in your backpack and is a great addition to a hunting party that's targeting wild pigs or boar. And useful for fending off 'critters big enough to eat you'. The new gun, unveiled at the annual SHOT show in Las Vegas, costs $1,200.","UCSF researchers looked at 15 studies on gun ownership and violence .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Levi Aron, the 'Butcher of Brooklyn', plead guilty today after admitting to the murder of eight-year-old Leiby Kletzky, who was abducted last July as he walked home from day camp alone for the first time. The boy had to walk just seven blocks to get to where his parents were eagerly waiting for him, when he got lost and stopped to ask Aron for directions. In a gruesome confession, Aron told the courts that he smothered, dismembered and stuffed Leiby into a suitcase after snatching him from a Brooklyn street on July 11, 2011, in shockingly detached detail. Plea: Levi Aron arrives in New York state Supreme Court to plead guilty to murder . Guilty: Levi Aron, center, confers with his attorneys Howard Greenberg, left, Jennifer McCann, and Pierre Bazile, in New York state Supreme Court, . Under the deal, Aron would entered a guilty plea to murder, receiving up to life in prison, plus another 15 years for kidnapping. Judge Neil Firetog asked Aron a series of questions during the court appearance. He admitted to kidnapping the boy, taking him to a wedding in Rockland County and then killing him. Just two days after Leiby went missing last year, Aron penned a confessional that detailed his horrific crime. 'He fought back a little bit until [sic] eventually he stopped breathing,' Aron wrote. 'I carried the body to the front room to start by placing him on the red mattress where I cut one leg at the hip.' Today he told the court again that he tied Leiby up with a towel when they returned from the wedding. 'What did you do with that towel?' asked the judge. 'Smothered him,' he whispered. Then, the judge asked him what he did next. 'I got rid of the body,' Aron said, according to the New York Post. 'How did you get rid of the body,' the judge asked. Brutal killing: Leiby Kletzky, 8, was walking home alone for the first time last July when he was snatched from the street . 'I put it in a suitcase.' 'In order to put the body in a suitcase, did you have to cut up the body?' 'Yes,' Aron replied. 'Did you get a knife?' 'Yes.' 'From where?' the judge asked. 'The kitchen.' 'What did u do with the suitcase?' 'I took it to a dumpster.' Nachman and Esther Kletzky did not attend the hearing, but did issue a statement. 'There is no way one can comprehend or understand the pain of losing a child,' Nachman Kletzky said. 'Esther and I faced this unspeakable tragedy last year when out little boy Leiby was ruthlessly taken from us.' 'Today my family has finally received some partial closure on one aspect of this nightmare. Closure does not mean we don't continue to feel the pain.' He continued: 'A day does not pass without our thinking of Leiby -- but today we close the door on this one aspect of our tragedy and seek to remember only the gifts that God has bestowed, including the nine years Leiby was with us.' Confession: Levi Aron penned this horrific confession after his arrest last year . Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who has been speaking on behalf of the Kletzky family, told the New York Daily News that the family did not want to go through with a trial. 'The family has to live with this for the rest of their lives. They want to bring this to a conclusion,' he said. 'The idea of having a trial was not something that they wanted to go through. They want to make sure that there is justice.' There was no comment from Aron's defense lawyers on the plea deal. Last . July, Leiby got lost on his walk home from day . camp and asked Aron, whom he met on the street, for help. Family: Nachman Kletzy and his family mourn his son Leiby in Brooklyn . Saying goodbye: The close-knit Hasidic . community said goodbye to the boy in a funeral in Borough Park . It was the first time the child had been allowed to walk home alone. He was supposed to walk just seven blocks to . meet his mother but missed a turn. Aron, . a hardware supply store clerk, took the boy home where they watched TV before the boy fell asleep, police said. Leiby . remained there the next day when Aron went to work - and a frantic . search was taking place in the community for the lost boy. 'Towards the end of the day when I saw the flyers, I panicked and was affraid [sic],' he wrote in his confession on July 13, 2011. Heavy matters: Levi Aron, the confessed killer of an 8-year-old Hasidic boy, has gained a significant amount of weight while in jail at Rikers . Booking: Levi Aron, right,  is seen being led into the 67th Precinct by police July 14, 2011 . He made the boy a tuna sandwich before smothering him with a towel. 'He fought back a little bit until [sic] eventually he stopped breathing,' Aron wrote. Not knowing what to do with the body, Aron began cutting into the boy's skin. 'I carried the body to the front room to start by placing him on the red mattress where I cut one leg at the hip,' he wrote. 'I understand this maybe [sic] wrong and I'm sorry for hurt that I've caused.' Levi Aron . Referring then on to the boy's limbs as 'parts' he stuffed them in the refrigerator and took two showers. 'I panicked and looked for something to transport the parts. Then putting the parts in a suitcase. Then carrying suitcase to the car. Then left,' he wrote. He put the suitcase in a dumpster just two miles from his home. Officials found Leiby's severed feet still wrapped in plastic in his freezer. Afterwards he told officers that he was hearing voices telling him ‘to take his own life for . what he did.' Aron, . who has grown massively obese while on Riker's Island, was allegedly . suffering from psychotic episodes and placed on suicide watch. My name is Levi Aron. Jailed for life: Levi Aron, 36, accepted a plea deal for the kidnap, murder and dismemberment of Leiby Kletzky last July in Brooklyn, New York . On Monday evening around 5:30P I went to my dentist Dr Sorcher to make a payment for visit for exam routine. A boy approached me on where the Judaica book store was, he was still there when went out from the dentist's office. He asked me for a ride to the Judaica book store. While on the way, he changed his mind and wasn't sure where he wanted to go. So I asked if he wanted to go for the ride (wedding in Monsey). Since I didn't think I was going to stay for the whole thing since my back was hurting. He said OK. Due to traffic I got back around 11:30P and my back was hurting from earlier that day. So I brought him to my house, thinking I'd bring him to his house the next day. He watched TV, then fell asleep in the front room. I went to the middle room to sleep. That next morning he was still sleeping when I was ready to leave. So I woke him and told him I'll bring him to his house when I get back afterwards. Towards the end of the day when I saw the flyers, I panicked and was affraid [sic]. When I got home he was still there. So I made him a tuna sandwich. I was still in panic from the fliers and affraid [sic] to bring him home (his house). That is when approximately I went for a towel to smother him (in the side room.) He fought back a little bit until [sic] eventually he stopped breathing. Afterwards, I panicked because I didn't know what do with the body. After about 15-20 minutes, I carried the body to the front room to start by placing him on the red mattress where I cut one leg at the hip. Then carried the two parts to the back room placing the two parts between freezer and frigerator [sic], then placing plastics covering floor and table. Was having trouble the leg to fit in the bag, so I had to cut at bottom. Then separating the other leg in same places, I place the parts in freezer, then showered.

"By . David Mccormack . and Reuters Reporter . Mysterious British graffiti artist Banksy is staging a month-long ‘residency’ in New York City, but the first two works have both already been vandalized within hours of being created. The reclusive artist announced on his website on Tuesday that he would be ‘attempting to host an entire show on the streets of New York’ throughout October in a project called Better Out Than In. The first piece was found on the streets of the Lower East Side neighborhood in Manhattan. The first of Banksy's new pieces showed two boys wearing caps, with one reaching up to a can of spray paint and a sign which said 'Graffiti Is A Crime' It showed two boys wearing caps, with one reaching up to a can of spray paint and a sign which said ‘Graffiti Is A Crime.’ The work, called ‘The street is in play’, was accompanied by a telephone number which passersby could call for an audio guide to the painting. The audio informed viewers somewhat prophetically: ‘Before you, you will see a spray art by the artist Banksy. Or maybe not. It's probably been painted over by now.’ It also said that the ‘children represent youth’ and the ‘sign represents, well, signs.’ But within hours of its whereabouts being announced, the work had been first whitewashed and then covered with other clearly inferior graffiti . But no sooner had word got out about the art work than it had been defaced, first with whitewash and then with other inferior graffiti which read: 'Sweaty palms made me lose the love of my life!' A second piece of art was then uncovered in the Chelsea neighborhood underneath the High Line tourist attraction. The white, spray-painted text read: ‘This is my New York accent’ in a traditional graffiti font, while underneath it was sprayed in a sans serif font: ‘…normally I write like this.’ But that too has already been vandalized with someone spraying their own tag over the top of it. Banksy, a pseudonym for the elusive artist who first emerged in the streets of Bristol, England and whose real identity is unknown, has become a coveted contemporary painter in the art world, known for his trademark spray-paint stencils on buildings that offer social commentary. A second Banksy piece was uncovered in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York underneath the High Line tourist attraction . The artist appeared in and directed the 2010 Oscar-nominated documentary 'Exit Through the Gift Shop' with his face and voice obscured. Earlier this year, two spray-painted murals by Banksy were pulled from an auction in Miami, including one entitled 'Slave Labour,' after questions arose about the ownership of the works and how the auction house obtained them. 'Slave Labour' eventually sold at a private auction in London for $1.1 million in June. Another Banksy mural, the 'Flower Girl' found painted on the wall of a Los Angeles gas station in 2008, is up for auction in December in Beverly Hills, and estimated to fetch between $150,000 and $300,000. Unfortunately that too has already been vandalized with someone spraying their own tag over the top .","The reclusive British graffiti artist has announced a month-long 'residency' in NYC .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Torment: Cristian Fernandez, who was 12 when he allegedly killed his brother, was born to a 12-year-old mother and abused throughout his . upbringing . Police and family services records have given a startling insight into the heartbreaking childhood of a 13-year-old boy accused of beating his two-year-old brother to death. Cristian Fernandez reportedly suffered neglect at the hands of a teenage mother and a drug-abusing grandmother, sexual abuse by a cousin and physical assaults by a stepfather who went on to kill himself. Fernandez, who was just 12 when he fatally smashed his brother's head against a book shelf, could become America's youngest ever 'lifer' after being charged as an adult over the murder. But the case has ignited a fierce debate over whether the punishment is too strict for a child - particularly for one who was left to languish in a poisonous upbringing littered with abuse. Fernandez was born in Miami, Florida in 1999 to . Biannela Susana, who was just 12. The boy's 25-year-old father received 10 years' probation for sexually assaulting her. Two years later, both . mother and son went to foster care after authorities found the toddler filthy, naked and walking in the street at 4am . near the motel where his grandmother, who was taking care of him, was found surrounded by cocaine. In 2007, when . Fernandez was eight, the Department of Children and Families investigated a . report that he was sexually molested by an older cousin. Officials noted there were other troubling incidents: he killed a kitten; he simulated . sex with classmates; he masturbated at school. The boy learned to squelch his feelings, once telling a counselor: 'You got to suck up feelings and get over it.' Advice: Cristian Fernandez, 13, left, talks with his attorneys in Jacksonville, Florida who question whether he fully understands his rights . Entrance: Wearing a bright orange jumpsuit that collects around his ankles, Cristian is seen while entering the courtroom on murder and sexual abuse charges . By October 2010, . Fernandez and his mother were living with her new husband when he suffered an eye injury so bad that his school sent him to the hospital where he was examined for . retinal damage. Fernandez told officers that his stepfather had punched . him. When officers went to the family's apartment, they found the . stepfather dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The . family moved north to Jacksonville and Fernandez enrolled in middle . school, getting straight A's, and they settled in a bland, beige public . housing complex. On June 3, 2011, deputies . were called to the apartment: Fernandez's baby brother, David, . was dead inside. He was found to have a fractured skull, bruising to his left eye and a bleeding brain. Susana, . then 25, admitted to investigators that she had left Fernandez, David . and her other children home alone. When she returned, she said she found . David unconscious. It later emerged that Susana surfed the internet for four hours while her youngest child lay dying, and she even admitted to looking for information on child concussions before eventually calling police. Bad start: His mother Biannela Susana, left, fell pregnant when she was 12 and the 25-year-old father was found guilty of sexual abuse. Cristian, right, was also sexually abused when he was young . Involvement: Biannela Susana, right, is escorted out of the courtroom in shackles after pleading guilty to aggravated manslaughter in the death of her 2-year-old son . When they arrived, Susana revealed that two weeks before David's death, Cristian had broken the toddler's leg while wrestling. The medical examiner said . David might have survived if she had taken him to the hospital sooner . for the head injury and she was charged with aggravated manslaughter. She pleaded guilty in March and could get 30 years behind bars. Fernandez was charged with . first-degree murder. Another felony charge was filed after his five-year-old half-brother told a psychiatrist that Fernandez had sexually . assaulted him. The boy has talked openly to investigators and . therapists about his crimes and his life; the gritty details are . captured in various court documents. 'Cristian denied any plans . or intent to kill his brother,' one doctor wrote. 'He seemed rather . defensive about discussing what triggered his anger. Too young? Fernandez is being tried as an adult and could face life in jail, which has sparked a fierce debate . Neglect: His mother admitted she surfed the internet for hours after her youngest son was beaten . 'He talked about . having a ""flashback"" of the abuse by his stepfather as the motive for . this offense... Cristian was rather detached emotionally while . discussing the incident.' Fernandez has been charged as an adult and is the youngest inmate awaiting trial in Duval County. Based on psychological evaluations, . prosecutors say that Fernandez poses a significant risk of violence, . which is why he has been detained and charged with two first-degree . felonies. If convicted of either crime, Fernandez could face a life sentence - a possibility that has stirred strong emotions among those for and against such strict punishment. The case is one of the most complex and difficult in Florida's courts, and it could change how first-degree murder charges involving juvenile defendants are handled statewide. One complication involves whether Fernandez understood his rights during police interrogations. Richard Kuritz, a former Jacksonville prosecutor who is now a defense attorney, said everyone agrees that Fernandez should face consequences if convicted - but what should they be? Scene: After searching for words like 'coma' and concussions online, she eventually called police . Bleak life: Cristian, who lived with his mother on this Jacksonville street, had spent years in foster care . Child: A video shows him talking with police. His lawyers question whether he fully understood his rights . 'What would be a fair disposition? I don't suspect this case is going to end anytime soon,' said Kuritz, who has been following the case closely. Supporters of local State Attorney Angela Corey say she's doing the right thing by trying Fernandez as an adult: holding a criminal accountable to the full extent of the law. But others, like Carol Torres, say Fernandez should be tried in juvenile court and needs help, not life in prison. 'He should be rehabilitated and have a second chance at life,' said Torres, 51. Her grandson attended school with Fernandez and she has created a Facebook page to support him. In other states, children accused of violent crimes are often charged or convicted as juveniles. In 2011, a Colorado boy pleaded guilty to killing his two parents when he was 12; he was given a seven-year sentence in a juvenile facility and three years parole. A Pennsylvania boy accused of killing his father's pregnant fiancee and her unborn child when he was 11 was sent this year to a juvenile facility where he could remain in state custody until he is 21. Last month, Judge Mallory Cooper ruled his interrogations are not admissible, saying he couldn't knowledgeably waive his rights to remain silent and consult an attorney. Prosecutors are appealing.","Cristian Fernandez was 12 when he 'smashed brother's head against shelf and sexually abused his five-year-old cousin'

"By . Jennifer Smith . We are a nation of addicts, struggling to stop ourselves from eating fast food, using Facebook and swearing, a new survey has revealed. Among other vices is a love of coffee and tea, smoking and chocolate - though these are all things we are trying to give up according to research. A list of the 50 habits we most want to curb has been compiled after electronic cigarette company, ECigaretteDirect.co.uk, asked 600 adults the things they'd most like to live without. Addictions to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter were among the top 20 bad habits people are trying to give up . Giving up smoking was the thing people struggled most with, with alcohol and junk food following closely behind. Reality television, biting fingernails and picking your nose are among the more bizarre bad habits with each appearing in the list's top ten vices. Cracking knuckles, picking teeth in public and road rage featured further down the list as did obsessive spending and racking up credit card bills. Racking up credit card bills and, surprisingly, going to the gym were also listed as bad habits people are trying to curb . Unsurprisingly, technology based hang-ups such as Twitter and Google appeared in the top 20, as did addictions to iPads and smartphones. While it's easy to see why most things . on the list would be considered bad habits, others such as going to the . gym, shaving, and supporting a football team are perhaps not as . threatening. A spokesman for the survey said: 'Giving something up takes a lot of willpower and not everyone has the determination to see it through. 'People who canâ€™t give up can consider switching to an alternative, such as switching to artificial sweeteners when giving up sugar, or electronic cigarettes instead of tobacco.' While many would think it's women who worry most about their figures, one man admitted to constantly trying to ditch junk food in a bid to lose weight. 'Iâ€™ve tried giving up fast food many times but it is just so delicious and there are those nights when you get home from work so late that all you want to do is crash in front of the TV with a bottle of larger and a curry.'

Sign of the times: The distinctive architecture of the Sixties comes to the fore in this image of the Oasis Tower in Great Yarmouth . Anyone for a spot of fishing? The tall masts of fishing boats at Ramsgate harbour complete the perfect snap of a seaside promenade . These are the iconic, idyllic summertime scenes from the Sixties created by Somerset-born photographer John Hinde, whose encapsulation of happy holidays are currently featured in Postcards, an exhibition at London’s Photographers’ Gallery. It is no coincidence that each one appears to have come straight from a glossy brochure, because Hinde, who used the ground floor of his house as studio and production department, was meticulous in making sure every scene looked just right — even down to removing or covering up eyesores. ‘We were given instructions to get the best shot possible, no matter how long it might take’ said Edmund Nagele, one of the small team of photographers recruited to Hinde’s burgeoning business.

The scene, bursting with detail and energy, shows the style of the era off, both in fashion and motors . ‘And it often took several weeks to capture a single postcard snap.’ Hinde also wanted people in his . postcards — ‘they gave the picture life, a point of interest and more . importantly a blob of colour’ — and was not averse to getting his . Italian editors to remove unsightly telegraph poles or make dull colours . more vibrant. Born in Street, Somerset, Hinde was the great-grandson of James Clark, founder of the town’s Clark’s Shoes. He . worked as a war photographer capturing scenes of the Blitz, then in . 1949 he briefly put down his camera to work as a PR manager for .

"By . Nick Mcdermott, Science Reporter . Relaxed: The research suggests women are better at coping with stressful environments . Multi-tasking mothers have known it for years – women are better at coping with stress than men. Now scientists believe they can tell them why. It’s all down to the protective effect of oestrogen, which appears to ‘block’ the negative effects of stress on the brain. In a US study, scientists put male and female rats through tasks that mimicked challenging experiences humans often face, such as those causing frustration and feelings of being under pressure. The female rats showed no impairment in their ability to recognise objects they had previously been shown, said study leader Dr Zhen Yan, while the male rats struggled with their short-term memory. An inability to remember a familiar object indicates a disturbance in the part of the brain that controls working memory, attention, decision-making and other high-level ‘executive’ processes. ‘Previous studies have found that females are more resilient to chronic stress and now our research has found the reason why,’ said Dr Yan, a professor in the department of physiology and biophysics at the University of Buffalo. ‘We have examined the molecular mechanism underlying gender-specific effects of stress.’ Earlier research by the professor found that repeated stress resulted in this area of the brain being damaged in young male rats. But the latest study found that it remained intact in females, even after they were subjected to stress. Stressed out: A study of rats found males struggled with their short-term memory in stressful situations . And by exposing the male rodents to greater levels of oestrogen, the team found they were protected from the effects of pressure. ‘When oestrogen signalling in the brains of females was blocked, stress exhibited detrimental effects on them,’ said Dr Yan. ‘When oestrogen signalling was activated in males, the detrimental effects of stress were blocked. ‘We still found the protective effect of oestrogen in female rats whose ovaries were removed. It suggests that it might be oestrogen produced in the brain that protects against the detrimental effects of stress.’ The team found that levels of an enzyme linked to the production of oestrogen, known as aromatase, is responsible for female stress resilience. Higher concentrations were found in the brains of female rats, they reported in the journal Molecular Psychiatry. ‘If we could find compounds similar to oestrogen that could be administered without causing hormonal side effects, they could prove to be a very effective treatment for stress-related problems in males,’ Dr Yan said.","US researchers test brains of male and female rats in stressful situations .

"By . Jill Reilly . and Sara Malm . Tragedy: Lauren Patterson, 24, was murdered in Qatar in October last year . The mother of a British school teacher murdered in Qatar sobbed as her killer was sentenced to death by a court in Qatar today. Lauren Patterson, 24, from Kent, was sexually assaulted and stabbed before her burnt remains were left smouldering in a remote desert location by a local 'casual acquaintance' in October last year. Badr Hashim Khamis Abdallah al-Jabr and an accomplice maintained Miss Patterson's death was accidental, but were today found guilty of the brutal killing. Miss Patterson's grief-stricken mother Alison was in court in Doha to hear the verdict and dropped her head into her hands and let out a brief sob upon hearing the sentence. She was supported by more than a dozen friends and family in the courtroom. Another man, Mohamed Abdallah Hassan Abdul Aziz, was jailed for three years for helping the killer to dispose of Miss Patterson's body by burning it, as well as damaging and getting rid of other evidence. Both men were arrested after Miss Patterson's remains were found in a remote desert spot outside the Qatari capital city of Doha in October last year, shortly after she went missing after a night out. Her mother said Al-Jabar's sentence meant ‘justice has been served’ for the killing of ‘my beautiful daughter’. In a statement issued by the Foreign Office, she described Ms Patterson as ‘my closest friend and confidant’ who helped raise her siblings after the sudden death of her father. She said: ‘Nothing will ever bring my daughter back. As a family we will never be able to replace the times we were looking forward to: Lauren getting married, having children - all of those things and more have been taken away from us by these two individuals. ‘Even though this trial is now over, we will never forget Lauren, nor the horrific way she was murdered. ‘Because of the truly heinous and brutal way in which Badr Hashim Khamis Abdullah Al-Jabar and Muhammad Abdullah Hassan Abdul Aziz tried to dispose of Lauren's body, we were not able to say a final goodbye. Unbearable loss: Alison Patterson, pictured with Lauren's uncle Brian Roke, was in court in Doha to hear the verdict and sobbed upon hearing the death sentence for her daughter's killer . 'Excited to be back': Lauren Patterson, right, was clubbing with best friend Lea Monet, left, before she was killed. Two Qatari men are on trial and the prosecutor has called for one of them to be given the death penalty . ‘This will be etched in my memory till . the day I die. Nothing will ever make the pain and grief that we have . all suffered go away. It is something none of us will forget. ‘ . At a hearing earlier this year, Lea Monet . testified how she, Miss Patterson and the two men, who she said they were . 'casually acquainted with', had left a nightclub at La Cigale Hotel in Doha . around 3.30am on October 12 last year. She . said Miss Patterson, who had just returned from attending her . grandmother's funeral in England, was not drunk and was 'aware of her . surroundings'. She said the men dropped her home with the promise they would also drop off her friend shortly afterwards at her house. The Miss Monet told the court when she tried to call Miss Patterson the following morning her phone was off. She said when she asked one of the two men about this, he said he could have dropped off Miss Patterson at the wrong building. Miss Monet said the next day . she noticed he had a cut on his lower lip and it was swollen, which were . not there when she last saw him. At the earlier hearing, the prosecutor said one of the defendants took Miss . Patterson to a residence he used for sexual trysts with women, 'conquered her . body', and killed her by stabbing her twice. Link: Miss Patterson was identified by DNA which was matched to her mother Alison (right), a reflexologist . School: The 24-year-old was working as a teacher at The Newton International School in Doha for several months before she was killed . Favourite: Lauren enjoyed an evening at Club 7, pictured, before she was killed . He . said with the help of the second defendant, he put Miss Patterson's . body in the boot of his car and drove her out of the city of Doha to . Al-Kharrara, where they burned her remains. He . said Miss Patterson, who worked at a primary school in Doha, had been . sexually assaulted but forensic tests could not prove this because the . remains were too badly burned. He also petitioned the court for . monetary compensation, saying that Miss Patterson's mother had requested . 20 million Qatar Riyal (approximately £3.6 million pounds) be paid by . the defendants - 15 million Qatar Riyal for the pain Miss Patterson must . have endured before her death, and five million Qatar Riyal for the . emotional damage felt by her mother. Qatari . journalists say MIss Patterson's murder has drawn significant . international attention, and the trial has proceeded quickly through the . country's often slow court system. The court was told this morning the death penalty would be carried out by either hanging or shooting. However, . the death sentence has not actually been carried out in Qatar for more . than 10 years despite courts giving out such a punishment for crimes. The two convicted men did not appear to show any emotion when the verdict and their sentences were announced in court. They were led out out of court by guards immediately afterwards. Outside court, Lauren's mum Alison walked along a line of supporters, many of whom were in tears, giving each one a hug. She declined to comment to the media. It is not yet known if the convicted men plan to appeal their sentences.","Lauren Patterson disappeared after a night out in Doha last year .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Strange underwater rings spied in shallow water off the coast of Denmark are caused by poison – and not aliens or fairies, biologists have said. A holidaying journalist took a photo of the mysterious 'fairy rings' in the clear water off the Isle of Møn, leading people to speculate about the cause of the underwater fairy rings. The rings are formed of vivid green eelgrass and measure up to 49ft (15m) wide and their shape is created by toxins in the water. Strange underwater rings (pictured) spied in shallow water off the coast of Denmark are caused by poison and not aliens or fairies, biologists have said. The rings are formed of eelgrass and measure up to 49ft (15m) wide . The rings are eelgrass and measure up to 49ft (15m) wide. Studying the mud surrounding the bizarre rings, Danish biologists discovered high levels of sulphide, which is poisonous to the grass. The plants trap the toxic soil so that there is a high concentration around them. The rings form because of the circular pattern in which eelgrass naturally grows and the toxin killing off older, weaker plants. Younger eelgrass plants seem to be better at withstanding the toxin than the older plants at the centre of a circular colony, which die and leave a ‘hole’ so that the plants look like rings. The result is an exceptional circular shape, where only the rim of the circle survives. Danish biologists have confirmed that the circles have ‘nothing to do with either bomb craters or landing marks for aliens’. Marianne Holmer from the University of Southern Denmark and Jens Borum from the University of Copenhagen also ruled out fairies, ‘who in the old days got the blame for similar phenomena on land,’ they said. Instead, they believe the rings form because of the circular pattern in which eelgrass naturally grows and the toxin killing off older, weaker plants, according to the journal Marine Biology. Studying the mud surrounding the bizarre rings, they discovered high levels of sulphide, which is poisonous to the grass and can gradually build up on a chalky seabed, just like Møn’s. The toxin can also occur if agricultural pollutants leak into the water, NBC News reported. Scientists believe that the rings form because of the circular pattern in which vivid green eelgrass (pictured) naturally grows and the toxin killing off older, weaker plants . ‘Most mud gets washed away from the barren, chalky seabed, but like trees trap soil on an exposed hillside, eelgrass plants trap the mud and therefore there will be a high concentration of sulphide-rich mud among the eelgrass plants,’ the biologists said. While the grass might look a little like some types of seaweed, it is a flowering plant that expands outwards to create circular colonies when it grows. Younger eelgrass plants seem to be better at withstanding the toxin than the older plants at the centre of a circular colony, which die and leave a hole so that the plants look like rings. Holmer and Borum said: ‘The result is an exceptional circular shape, where only the rim of the circle survives - like fairy rings in a lawn.’ The investigation into the underwater rings started when journalist Jacob Topsøe took a photo of them on a private trip at the cliffs of Møn and afterwards wrote an article for regional publication DR Sjælland, which spread though Denmark’s TV channels and newspapers. Some fairy rings on land have been blamed on fungus, but others have baffled scientists, such as those found in the grasslands of Nambia. Hungry ants, seeping gas and competition for resources have all been blamed for the markings there.","A holidaying journalist took a photo of the previously mysterious phenomena in the clear water off the Isle of Møn, Denmark .

"By . Katy Winter . The Sound of Music may have come out almost half a century ago, but it seems our fascination with Maria and the Von Trapp family shows no signs of waning. Some of the iconic costumes from the 1965 film - including the outfits Maria fashions out of old curtains - were snapped up at auction yesterday for a cool $1.3m (£845,000). All seven children’s floral patterned green and white costumes were sold, alongside Maria’s ‘Do Re Mi’ dress, worn by Julie Andrews when she teaches the children how to sing. The auction included the iconic brown dress (left) worn by Maria as she sang 'Do Re Mi' to the Von Trapp children (left), as well as lederhosen worn by the Von Trapp boys (right) The scene in which Julie Andrews, as Maria, teaches the children how to sing on the mountains, using the song 'Do, Re, Mi' is one of the best known in the film . Consisting of a heavy brown homespun Austrian-style dress with wheat-colored blouse, the costume features 20th Century-Fox labels on the internal collar and waistband. The children’s school uniforms from the beginning of the film were also sold, along with outfits worn during the climactic ‘escape’ scene, where the family cross over the mountains into Switzerland. The film, which won five Oscars in 1966, gave us classic Rodgers and Hammerstein  songs like ‘Edelweiss’ and ‘My Favorite Things’ and made Julie Andrews a superstar. Julie said in a 2012 interview with Oprah that, while filming, she had no idea the impact the film would have, confessing: ‘It made my career. It was that big [of] a movie.’ As well as the grey school uniforms worn at the start of the film, the auction included the full set of outfits (pictured) made by Maria and worn by the Von Trapp children throughout the film . The story, of a vivacious young women helping to heal a family through music, set during the drama of the Second World War, has stood the test of time . The film tells the story of spirited young nun who brings together seven motherless children and their stern father through the power of music, before all of them are forced to flee from the invading Nazis. Sickly sweet to some, the film was given a lukewarm reception by critics when it was released, yet captured the hearts of generations of children. It was a huge success at the box office when it came out, earning nearly $300 million. As well as continuing to sell well on DVD, the musical, which opened on Broadway in 1959, is still popular across the world. The story even spawned a reality show in recent years. In 'How do you solve a problem like Maria'  musical theatre wannabes auditioned for the part of Maria in a West End production. The Sound of Music sale, by auction house Profiles in History, run by Joe Maddalena, was part of a Hollywood memorabilia sale which also saw the sale of a painting of Tara from Gone With The Wind, used in the film's opening sequence, for $270,000 (£175,000).","Pieces were put up for auction by Profiles in History in Hollywood .

"By . Sanya Burgess . With her blonde hair, long limbs and Amazonian physique, German model Veruschka was the Kate Moss of the 1960s. Now rare photographs of the model, taken during the early days of her career, have been released in a new book, Veruschka. In one dramatic black and white shot, the willowy model smoulders in a delicate beaded black dress, while one simple portrait shows off her enormous blue eyes to maximum advantage. Iconic: Legendary photographer Arthur Evans and supermodel Veruschka in action during a shoot . Striking: The 6ft 3"" beauty became one of the most iconic models of the 1960s . The new book, which includes some of the most iconic photographs ever taken of the model, is the result of a collaboration between LA-based photographer David Willis and Veruschka, now 74, herself. Along with musings and anecdotes from Veruschka, real name Vera Gottliebe Anna, Countess von Lehndorff, the text also includes interviews with some of the 20th century's greatest fashion names, among them Diana Vreeland and Grace Mirabella. Although both Vreeland and Mirabella had fascinating careers, most interesting of all is Veruschka's own story. Born in East Prussia in 1939, the future supermodel endured a dangerous childhood. Her father, Count Heinrich von Lehndorff, joined the German resistance, reportedly after witnessing Jewish children being beaten and murdered. Later, Count von Lehndorff was executed for his involvement in the 20th July plot - a bid to assassinate Hitler in his East Prussia field headquarters which were located in the grounds of the von Lehndorff family home. Afterwards, her mother was imprisoned and the four children were put into a camp for children of resistance fighters. By the time the war ended, Veruschka and her family had lost everything. Homeless, she and what was left of her family drifted around Europe. Eventually, Veruschka found herself in Florence and hoped to become an artist, but all that changed when she was scouted at the age of 20 by Italian photographer, Ugo Muglas. Glamorous: Veruschka eventually commanded modelling fees of up to $10,000 (Â£6,000) a day . Must read: The new book is a joint collaboration between photographer David Willis and Veruschka herself . He took her to Paris, where she was introduced to Eileen Ford, head of the Ford Modelling Agency, who immediately spotted her potential. From there, her rise was swift and lucrative, with the model commanding fees of up to $10,000 (Â£6,000) at the peak of her career. She also appeared in several films, among them cult 1966 film Blow Up, and most recently in 2006 Bond film, Casino Royale. And despite being well into her 70s, she hasn't given up her modelling career either, making a guest appearance at Melbourne Fashion Festival in 2000 and taking a spin on the Giles catwalk during London Fashion week in 2010.

"By . Dan Bloom . Accused: A witness said Michael Piggin, now 18, drew a large knife from his trenchcoat . A neo-Nazi accused of plotting a 'new Columbine' told a fellow pupil he kept a hit list of people he wanted to kill, a court heard today. Michael Piggin was just 16 when he is alleged to have started planning the deadly attack on teachers and classmates at his former school in Loughborough, Leicestershire. Today a college classmate told the jury Piggin hated foreign classmates because he thought they were all being paid benefits and 'wished we could kill them all'. The Old Bailey heard the two boys were initially friends, but fell out when Piggin made a string of racist remarks at another college student, it is said. 'He hated a lot of the foreign people on the course, and he said he would kill all of them', the classmate told the jury. 'He said all of them were getting dole money, benefit money, and he wished we could kill them all - out of order comments. 'He always fantasised of killing people, and said he had a gun range at home with peoples' heads on it. 'He just said he had a list of people on there that he was going to kill.' Piggin allegedly stockpiled knives, guns, homemade bombs and a crossbow on his bedroom floor, and kept a journal of his plans to commit mass murder. He is accused of planning a Columbine-style massacre at his former school and wanting to attack the council offices, a local cinema, and Loughborough . University. The English Defence League supporter, now 18, bragged about getting a machete for his birthday and making bombs in his bedroom, the jury heard. Today the classmate told the trial Piggin once pulled a large knife out of his trench coat pocket and told him 'look at this f***er'. Two weeks later, he showed off three knives in class after the teacher left the room, it is alleged. 'It was quite a big knife, really long, and he had it in his pocket,' the classmate said. Bedroom: The jury was shown a photograph of Piggin's room at his home in Loughborough with a Nazi flag . Preparation: The jury was previously shown footage of Michael Piggin, now 18, 'testing' a Molotov cocktail against a wall behind a leisure centre while his friends filmed him on a mobile phone . Flames: The Old Bailey saw him launch the homemade explosive, which was put together using a wine bottle . 'It was a black knife, he put them all in his bag because the teacher came back into the classroom. 'There was another knife that he had in his boot.' In another incident when the boys met in town, Piggin allegedly said he was going to make a bomb. 'He told me he was going to make a bomb when he got home and he didn't laugh like he was joking, he just said it,' the witness said. He added Piggin fantasised about guns and committing mass murder. 'He said he had a gun on him at college and opened his bag', he said. 'Under his coat he had a gun shape. He said it is, but he didn't show me. 'I just saw what looks like an outline.' Organisation: The accused teenager is said to have plotted a Columbine-style massacre in Loughborough . Graffiti: More footage showed the defendant allegedly spraying 'No more mosques' on the wall. Today a classmate told his trial that Piggin wanted to kill foreign classmates and thought they were all on benefits . He said Piggin claimed to carry the knives 'for protection' and boasted about having a shooting range at home.

"By . Jill Reilly . An Indian billboard mourning Nelson Mandela's death has been put up in India, but a photo of actor Morgan Freeman has been mistakenly used. The memorial to Mandela was placed in the city of Coimbatore by the side of a road. Morgan Freeman played Mandela in 2009 film Invictus which is probably how the mistake arose. Scroll down for video . The face of Hollywood actor Morgan Freeman was used on a giant billboard instead of Nelson Mandela's in the tribute gaffe . 'We should be proud that we were part of an era when they lived,' read the condolence message on the board in Tamil. Cloth merchant Chandrashekhar, who paid for the board in a private capacity as a mark of respect to the former South African leader, said it was a mistake by the designer. 'We will replace it with the correct picture of Mandela,' the merchant, who uses one name, told AFP by telephone from Chennai, adding that he did not know how the gaffe occurred. On-screen portrayal: Morgan Freeman played Mandela in 2009 movie Invictus . Paying tribute: Morgan also posted a touching tribute message on his Facebook page . Earlier this month Morgan Freeman, paid tribute to Mandela, describing him as 'a saint to many, a hero to all who treasure liberty, freedom and the dignity of humankind'. The 76-year-old actor â€“ who some mistakenly posted a picture of next to tweets paying tribute to Mandela - added: 'As we remember his triumphs, let us, in his memory, not just reflect on how far we've come, but on how far we have to go. 'Madiba may no longer be with us, but his journey continues on with me and with all of us.' Proceedings following the death of Mandela has brought around several gaffes.

"EXCLUSIVE By . Sam Webb . It appears that even the Queen's own bodyguard are not immune from absurd health and safety rules after these Household Cavalry troops were pictured wearing high visibility jackets on the streets of central London. The photograph was taken in Kensington, close to Hyde Park where the Household Cavalry is based, and shows around half a dozen riders wearing the safety clothing as they rode along a busy street. One onlooker said: 'It's bizarre and hardly very dignified for these soldiers. It's not like you can miss them anyway, they're on massive great horses and they're taking up a whole lane.' The Household Cavalry is made up of the two most senior regiments of the British Army, the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals. The troops are garrisoned at Hyde Park Barracks, close to Buckingham Palace, and is part of the Household Division and is the Queen's official bodyguard. Scroll down for video . Elf 'n' safety: These soldiers in the Household Cavalry were pictured wearing high-visibility jackets as they rode through central London, close to their Barracks in Hyde Park . These street cleaners - also wearing high-vis jackets - watch as the troops ride towards their barracks . An MoD spokesman said: 'The Highway Code states that â€œhorse riders should wear light coloured or fluorescent clothing in daylight and reflective clothing if riding at night or in poor visibility"". 'The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) also states that high visibility clothing should be worn by horse riders. 'In addition to the advice issued,  the Commanding Officer expects all his soldiers and Officers to comply with this advice to ensure safety for both other road users and themselves. 'The Department takes the safety of all its employees seriously and would expect them to take all reasonable measures to ensure they are safe and secure in whatever activity they are undertaking be it horse riding or otherwise.'

Marek Lazarz, director of the Stalag . Luft III Museum near Zagan, said the British group started in pouring . rain from a monument marking the place where 76 prisoners of war . emerged. During . observances this week, they have met two British former Stalag inmates, . retired RAF airmen Andrew Weisman and Charles Clarke, who were held at . the camp after the time of the Great Escape. The plot became the inspiration . behind the classic war film The Great Escape starring Hollywood legend . Steve McQueen. A group of about 250 prisoners, started . to digging tunnels, in which they were going to escape the 59-acre site, . which had five miles of perimeter fencing. Time for a change? A mock-up of what the Horse Guards Parade would look like if they decided to wear a high-vis jacket over their red uniform . If the concept of wearing a high-vis jacket was deployed across all units it could look like this.

More than 600 prisoners were involved . in the construction of three tunnels - codenamed Tom, Dick and Harry - . at the camp in the German Province of Lower Silesia, 100 miles southeast . of Berlin. Tom and Dick had to be abandoned with Harry becoming the focus of their escape route. It was approximately 300ft long and 28ft deep. Only 200 of the higher ranking . captives, those who could speak German and had put a lot of work into . digging the tunnels, would have time to escape in the plan. But there was a series of problems on the night of the escape. The main issue was that the Harry tunnel came up short and in close proximity to a guard tower. The plan: 250 officers spent 11 months building Harry, a 300ft tunnel out of the camp in Zagan, Poland . The site 100 miles south of Berlin was built to hold 10,000 prisoners of war during World War Two . This is a shot of the entrance of the Harry tunnel which captured the hearts of the world when it emerged . A commemorative stone has been laid over the track listing the names of the men who concocted the idea . As the 77th man exited the tunnel, . they were spotted by a guard who alerted the rest of the camp and 73 of . the escaped prisoners were captured. Fifty of those were shot. An RAF spokesman said:  'There are 50 current serving RAF personnel currently walking towards Poznan, which is the final resting place for Sqn Ldr Roger Bushell, who was the mastermind for the Great Escape; when these personnel are walking on busy main roads, which are not closed to traffic, they are wearing hi-vis jackets to ensure they reach their destination safely.'","Household Cavalry wore bright tabards as they rode towards Hyde Park .

"By . Larisa Brown . This is the moment an unsuspecting phone user had his mobile snatched in just two seconds by a hooded cyclist. The footage, captured in North London, was revealed as new figures showed thefts of mobile phones in London have soared by 64 per cent over the past three years with 300 mobiles now being stolen every day. Many of the thieves are youths on bikes or mopeds but others, often thefts from crowded bars, are organised by mainly Eastern European crime gangs. Nearly 10,000 phones were stolen just last month. Scroll down for video . A man on the pavement stands casually texting someone as a bike can be seen approaching towards him . Speedy grab: In just a few seconds a man on a bike zooms past him snatching his phone out of his hands . In the footage, the innocent victim is captured casually standing on the pavement texting a friend in one hand. Moments later a hooded cyclist suddenly streaks past at high speed and snatches the mobile from his hand. He is left stunned and opens his arms in frustration and anger as he realises what has happened. The whole incident, which took place on Essex Road in Islington in June, unfolds in a matter of seconds. New . figures show a total of 9,751 mobiles were stolen in thefts or . robberies last month - a 64 per cent rise on the number stolen in the . capital in December three years ago. In December 2009 there were 5,915 offences and in December 2010, there were 8,078 offences committed. Today Scotland Yard launched an advertising campaign to warn Londoners of the risks of phone and jewellery snatches. One advert showing a mobile phone reads: 'I . see easy cash so I run up to him and grab it from his hand', . highlighting how the thieves are often opportunistic rather than devious . planners.' Moving off: The criminal on the bike zooms into the distance while the victim is stunned by the event . Phone taken: The victim opens his arms out wide in disgust as he realises what just happened . Police say they are dealing with a 20 . per cent increase in the number of snatches and thefts of mobile phones . in London - around half of all phones stolen are Apple iPhones. And police say the phone thefts are driving a surge in theft rates across the capital. 'The impact of losing a phone is not just its market value but it can . have a huge emotional impact on people's lives. Often people's whole . lives are contained on their phone with contacts and photographs. These . can't always be replaced.' He added: 'Just being conscious of where you are and being careful about . when you display your valuables can help you avoid being targeted. ' Police say the vast majority of 38,018 thefts in the last nine months were of mobile phones. The . Met's analysis of the figures show victims of robbery are more likely . to be male, whereas young professional females are more prone to theft. The most common profile for all victims is a young professional likely to be aged between 20 and 20, out and about in the capital on a night out, in pubs and clubs or other public places. Police admit mobile phone companies are unlikely to take serious action when they can benefit from uninsured phones being stolen and having to be paid to replace. Undercover officers are now targeting hotspots where mobiles are being . stolen, it has been reported. Smart phones are either being sold in batches abroad or are advertised in the UK on internet sites such as eBay or Gumtree. Police on patrol in London are arming themselves with iPads or iPhones so they can track the signals of stolen phones with satellite tracking apps.",Police say smart phones are sold in batches abroad or advertised in UK .
"By . Martin Robinson . Cherie Blair hugged and kissed former IRA commander Martin McGuinness today after the pair joined 750 other mourners at the funeral of Tony Benn. The human rights QC smiled and embraced Northern Ireland's deputy First Minister as they filed out of St Margaret's Church, Westminster this afternoon. Public figures had been paying their last respects to Mr Benn, who served as a Labour MP for more than 50 years and died two weeks ago at 88. Mr McGuinness attended the service with Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, who Tony Blair admitted in his memoirs he liked 'more than I should have'. Warm embrace: Cherie Blair kissed and hugged Martin McGuinness after Tony Benn's Westminster funeral today .

Speaking about Tony Benn Mr Adams said:'He was a friend of Ireland and was good for the peace process'. Mrs Blair and her husband got to know Mr McGuinness and Mr Adams . during the peace process. 'Whether you like them or not, and no matter how strongly you disapprove of their past actions, they had courage in abundance,' Mr Blair wrote when he left power. Cherie Blair's warmth towards the Northern Irish politician came two years after the Queen shook his hand. The momentous act came 33 years after her cousin, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, was . murdered by an IRA bomb as he holidayed with his family. The decision to shake hands with a former IRA commander was an astonishing act of forgiveness by the . 86-year-old monarch who adored her ‘Uncle Dickie’. Her husband, . the Duke of Edinburgh, a nephew of Lord Mountbatten, also offered his . hand even though Philip was exceptionally close to his uncle and took . news of his murder in 1979 hard. Greeting: Hilary Benn (left), the son of former Labour cabinet minister Tony Benn, hugged and spoke to Martin McGuinness outside St Margaret's Church . Colleagues: Mr McGuinness was at the funeral with Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, who described Tony Benn as a 'friend of Ireland' Message: Gerry Adams tweeted to his 45,000 followers that he was off to London for today's funeral . It also emerged that he may be travelling to Windsor Castle next month for a state dinner hosted by Her Majesty. Mr McGuinness admitted his IRA past to the Saville Inquiry in 1998, . but has always insisted he never killed anyone – claims that have been . repeatedly questioned by his critics. He joined the Provisional IRA as a teenager and quickly rose up the ranks. By 1971, aged 21, he was second in command of the IRA in Derry. He . held that position at the time of Bloody Sunday, when 14 civil rights . protesters were killed by British paratroopers in the city.

Ireland's Special Criminal Court, after being caught with a car  loaded . with explosives and ammunition. He refused to recognise the court, and . was sentenced to six months imprisonment.

"By . Chris Brooke . A recent study has suggested children with stressed parents are more likely to be fat as they get older . Stressed parents are more likely to have obese children, a study has warned. Children whose parents have high levels of stress have a Body Mass Index, or BMI, about two per cent higher than those whose parents have low levels of stress. They also gained weight seven per cent faster than other children, the Canadian study claimed. Researcher Dr Ketan Shankardass warned if . not stopped at an early age, weight gain will continue to lead to . health problems later in the children's lives. He said: ‘Childhood is a time when we develop inter-connected habits related to how we deal with stress, how we eat and how active we are. ‘It’s a time when we might be doing irreversible damage or damage that is very hard to change later.’ Dr Shankardass said it was not clear why the link between stress and obesity existed. He said parents might change their behaviour when they were stressed, buying more ready meals or junk food to save time rather than preparing healthy meals. Parental stress could also have a knock . on effect for the children, who in turn cope by eating more and . exercising less, or whose stress leads to biological changes that cause . weight gain. The study by St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, looked at . data collected during the Children's Health Study, one of the largest . and most comprehensive investigations into the long-term effects of air . pollution on the respiratory health of children. The childrens' BMI . was calculated each year and their parents were given a questionnaire to . measure their perceived psychological stress. It asked how often in . the last month they were able or unable to control important things in . their life and whether things were going their way or their difficulties . were piling up so high they could not overcome them. Experts claim changes in parents' behavior such as buying more ready meals or junk food to save time when they are stressed could be a factor in the results (file photo) Rather than . focusing only on getting parents to change their behaviour, more needed . to be done to support families such as making sure they have a reliable . supply of healthy food or improving living conditions. He noted that . more than half the students followed in the California study were . Hispanic, and that the effects of stress on their BMI was greater than . children of other ethnic backgrounds. This was consistent with . other research which has suggested that Hispanic children may be more . likely to experience hypherphasia, excessive hunger or increased . appetite, and sedentary lifestyle. The study was published in the journal Pediatric Obesity.","Research found children with stressed parents had higher BMI than others .

At the close of a two-day summit, the group also agreed to open up their security procedures to independent review, a further step toward creating an international legal framework to thwart nuclear terrorism. The move is a joint initiative sponsored by host country the Netherlands, along with past summit hosts the United States and South Korea. 'I believe this is essential to the security of the entire world,' Obama said at a press conference wrapping up the summit. He added that more still needs to be done: 'Given the catastrophic consequences of even a single attack, we cannot be complacent.' All 53 countries that participated in the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague agreed Tuesday to keep looking for ways to ensure that nuclear material doesn't fall into the hands of terrorists. But the pledge to adopt nuclear guidelines into law and undergo external checks was endorsed by just 35 nations, including France, Britain, Canada, Japan, Israel and the three summit hosts. Notably absent from that agreement were Russia, China, India and Pakistan. North Korea and Iran didn't even attend. Since Obama launched the summits in 2010, the number of countries that have enough material to build a nuclear weapon has fallen from 39 to 25.","Courted more attention than husband King Willem-Alexander last night .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Action: Obese children have been taken away by social workers after being overfed by their families, a survey has revealed . Obese children have been taken away by social workers after being overfed by their families, it has been revealed. The super-size youngsters were placed in care across the UK amid fears their weight was wrecking their health. One child had a Body Mass Index (BMI) measurement of 35 - the equivalent of a six-foot man weighing 19st. It comes as an increasing number of parents give in to their children's cravings for unhealthy food - a phenomenon known as 'killing with kindness' In the past year alone, five British children have been taken from their . families because of overfeeding, according to a survey by the Sunday Express. These include two in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, one . in Oxfordshire, one in Salford, and one in Hounslow, London. And the year before, five other obese youngsters were placed in care in Sheffield, Portsmouth, Lincolnshire, Slough and Harrow, London. Professionals say families' gross over-eating can be one of the factors that leads to their children being taken into care. A social worker told the Sunday Express: 'Only in extreme cases would we take a child into care just . because of their weight as we would seek to work with the family to . improve their eating habits.' Britain's child obesity epidemic - which has seen hospitals deal with nearly 1,000 children in the past three years - is now thought to cost the NHS around Â£4.2billion every year, according to estimates put forward by the Royal College of Paediatrics. Warning: In 2006, ex-Chief Medical Officer Sir Liam Donaldson (left) warned that health chiefs would consider removing children from their families if they became super-sized, risking their health . Alarmingly, children as young as . ten months old have been admitted to hospital because they are . dangerously overweight, according to figures released in October. Portsmouth . Hospitals NHS Trust revealed that during the past year, doctors . have found themselves having to treat a ten-month-old baby for obesity â€“ with a . one year old also being referred to Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust as a . result of her weight. And a staggering 45 youngsters aged 17 or under have had fat-fighting operations on the NHS in the past five years, according to Conservative MP Priti Patel. However the true . scale of the problem is likely to be much higher, as less than a third . of hospital trusts have released information about the number of young . children whose weight has spiralled out of control. As well as being overfed, many overweight youngsters have also been fed a high-fat, sugary diet. In 2006, ex-Chief Medical Officer Sir Liam Donaldson warned that health chiefs would consider removing children from their families if they became super-sized, therefore risking their health. The first reported case was an eight-year-old girl in Cumbria, who became so obese that she was forced to wear size 16 clothes. She was taken into care in 2007 weighing a staggering 10st. A Department of Health spokesman said England has one of the highest rates of obesity in the western world, but health professionals and voluntary groups are working together to help individuals 'improve their diet and lifestyles'.","Super-size youngsters taken away by social workers after being overfed .

"By . Peter Campbell . On track: A high-speed Hitachi train on its way to London. The firm vows to boost its staff by 1,600 by 2017 . The firm behind Japan’s famous bullet train is set to move to Britain in a major boost for the economy. Industrial giant Hitachi is planning to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in the country and increase the number of its UK staff from 200 to 1,800 within three years. In a highly unusual move for a Japanese conglomerate, Hitachi has appointed a British director, Alistair Dormer, to lead its global train business from London. Hitachi Rail Global is also targeting lucrative rail contracts here, including bidding for work on the controversial £50billion HS2 project. The manufacturer of the bullet train aims to grow from a business employing 2,500 people today to 4,000 people over the next two and a half years. The company’s biggest train markets around the world are Japan, Taiwan and the UK and its annual sales are £1.67billion – but the firm plans to increase this to £2.5billion over the next few years. After the move, which was welcomed last night as ‘an incredible vote of confidence’ in Britain, the company is likely to use its new UK base to try to win work in Europe, taking on rivals including Alstom – the French maker of the Eurostar, and the German giant Siemens. Hitachi’s nuclear arm is also planning to build two power stations – in Gloucestershire and on Anglesey – after buying the project from its previous owners for £700million. Yesterday’s announcement comes months after Hitachi said its new factory in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, would employ more than 700 when it opens next year. The site will produce trains to run on the Great Western line and East Coast main line after the group won a £1.2billion contract. The high-tech company will be bidding for work on the controversial HS2 project in the UK . ‘We see it as a major operation in the . UK and we want to build in the UK for the rest of Europe,’ Mr Dormer . said yesterday, adding: ‘Both the UK and Japan remain important as . markets for Hitachi Rail. ‘With . our train factory in the North East of England now under construction, . we will work to realise our export potential from the UK. ‘It would be a great idea to build high-speed trains in the North East.’ Hitachi's deal marks a U-turn for its European boss – who had previously warned that  the UK would struggle to attract investment unless it decided to join the euro. Sir Stephen Gomersall has held a number of influential positions within the Japanese giant’s European division, including chief executive and chairman. He has been responsible for deals that brought more than £1billion of manufacturing to the UK. But previously, as Britain’s ambassador to Japan, he warned Tony Blair that foreign firms would abandon the UK unless it could show it was ‘on track’ to sign up to the single currency. In a memo to the Prime Minister in 2000 he said Britain was ‘not a safe bet’ for foreign firms because of its reluctance to ditch the pound in favour of the euro. He added: ‘Any sign that the Government was backtracking from its timetable could trigger a much stronger move towards disinvestment in the manufacturing sector.’ James Wharton, Conservative MP for . Stockton South, said: ‘Hitachi’s Newton Aycliffe factory is one of the . biggest investments in our area for a generation. ‘This a very positive sign as it gives people a lot more confidence that Hitachi is here for the long term.’ Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin added: ‘This is an incredible vote of confidence in a growing Britain that is exporting more and making great things once again. ‘Nothing says that better than the company that built the first bullet train putting its HQ here to sell abroad, alongside a new factory and new jobs in northern England.’ And Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘This demonstrates a huge vote of confidence in Britain, its workers and its rail industry from one of Japan’s biggest businesses.’ Chancellor George Osborne also welcomed the move, saying: ‘For people like me who have grown up with news of manufacturing jobs leaving Britain, isn’t it fantastic that manufacturing jobs are coming back to Britain.’ Once the envy of the world, Britain’s train-making industry has declined in recent years as manufacturers sought out cheaper options overseas. In 2011 the Government came under fire for awarding a £6billion Thameslink contract to German-owned Siemens rather than Bombardier –which at the time ran the UK’s last train factory in Derby. The move led to the loss of hundreds of British jobs. But Bombardier was given a welcome boost last month after winning a £1billion contract to provide trains for Crossrail. The company will build 65 trains for the cross-London rail service, which is due to be completed by 2018.","Hitachi Rail Global vows to increase UK staff from 200 to 1,800 by 2017 .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Kids' footwear brand Stride Rite has been slammed by parents for ‘forcing’ gender roles on children. An advert for its Star Wars collection shows a boy brandishing a lightsaber along with the strapline 'the power of Darth Vader' while a blonde-haired girl in a princess outfit models the Disney range. Margot Magowan, a mother of three girls from San Francisco, explains on her blog Reel Girl that she was 'saddened' by the company's stereotypical marketing strategy. Under fire: An advert for Stride Rite's Star Wars collection shows a boy brandishing a lightsaber along with the strapline 'the power of Darth Vader' while a blonde-haired girl in a princess outfit models the Disney range . She says that it heavily influences her daughters and 'their choices become more limited as they repeatedly see that girls are supposed to be so radically different than boys, only wear certain colors, and behave in a certain “feminine” way.' 'Please tell me why Stride Rite markets shoes to little kids as if girls and boys are completely different species,' she adds. She also says that the way boys and girls are directed to different sides of the store is 'manipulative and destructive'. Meanwhile Rebecca Hains, who has two young sons, says that she first noticed the company's gender-based approach last year. After walking into her local store in Massachusetts she saw bright pink posters pasted around the girls' section bearing the motto 'sparkle with every step.' 'My daughters repeatedly see that girls are supposed to be so radically different than boys and only wear certain colors' In contrast, the adverts around the boys' department were 'active', 'energetic' and 'powerful', featuring superhero characters such as Spiderman. The children’s media specialist adds on her blog rebeccahains.com that after reviewing Stride Rite's website she found 'more of the same'. 'Girls are meant to be looked at, so their play shoes are a route to prettiness, while boys are meant to be active, so their play shoes are made for play.' Dozens of customers have now posted on Stride Rite’s Facebook page asking it to ‘stop stereotyping’. Responding to the backlash a spokesperson for the retailer told MailOnine: 'Customer feedback regarding our stores and advertising is important to us and we are taking it into consideration.' Stride Rite isn't the only company to face criticism. Disney, Lego and Barbie have all been pressured by consumers to make products that are more gender-neutral. Research by Elizabeth Sweet, a doctoral candidate in sociology at the University of California, revealed that gender segregating and stereotyping of toys is getting worse. Growing problem: Recent research revealed that gender segregating and stereotyping of toys is getting worse . Writing in the New York Times last year, she said: 'We've made great strides toward gender equity over the past 50 years, but the world of toys looks a lot more like 1952 than 2012.' She highlighted that boys are encouraged to play with mechanical toys and science kits while for girls it's all about dolls. However, some believe gender role behaviors develop naturally, regardless of what toys children play with. Indeed, ifoughtthelaw writes on Jezebel.com in response to an article addressing the Stride Rite adverts: 'What's so strange is that a lot of little girls really gravitate towards the girly stuff. I am keeping all the princessy stuff far, far away from my daughter. 'I am not exactly dressing her in all boys clothes but I don't dress her overly pink and girly either. 'If it was up to me, she would always wear the most comfy, most sensible shoes but she LOVES girly shoes . . . those are all she wants to wear. 'She is only two and has never watched a princess movie. We are all about Sesame Street and Monsters Inc here and she wants to wear nothing but dresses and ballerina gear. Crazy.'","An advert for its Star Wars collection .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A girl who clambered onto a multi-million pound sculpture at a London museum was just being 'anti-establishment', her fashion designer parents said today. Art lovers were scandalised when a picture appeared on Twitter showing a family letting their children climb all over Donald Judd's $10million installation at Tate Modern. But today the child's parents, Stuart Trevor, 47, and Kait Bolongaro Trevor, 45, were unrepentant, calling it a 'simple faux pas' and saying their nine-year-old daughter Sissi Belle had simply been 'seduced by a ladder of jewel-coloured shelving'. Stuart and Kait Bolongaro Trevor with their children Sissi, nine, Louie, 14, and Harper, six - Sissi's parents defended her for climbing on the sculpture by saying she had 'always been anti-establishment' Sissi Bella Trevor was seen climbing on the $10million Donald Judd installation Untitled 1980 at Tate Modern on Sunday . The couple, who founded the All Saints clothing chain and live in East London with Sissi, her six-year-old sister Harper Bea, and older brother, Louie, defended their children, saying they had visited galleries and museums around the world and were just interested in the sculpture, Untitled 1980. Mrs Bolongaro Trevor told the Evening Standard: 'Their only crime was to be seduced by a ladder of jewel-coloured shelving. 'Sissi has always been anti-establishment but she would never hurt anybody.' Mr Trevor, who sold All Saints in 2005 and now runs the Bolongaro Trevor label with his wife, added: 'They have been all around the world and are extremely intelligent and educated and just happened to slide in the bottom of what looks like a row of shelves.' He insisted his girls were only on the sculpture for a few seconds, and said they were clever children who are obsessed by art. Mr Trevor said the incident happened while the children were on a day out with their aunt Lucy and uncle Frank on Sunday afternoon. Artwork: The sculpture by the post-war artist is made of perspex, steel and aluminium and resembles a ladder . A spokesman for Tate Modern, pictured, said: 'There is always risk of damage when visitors touch works of art' He said Stephanie Theodore, who photographed the children on the sculpture and then tweeted it saying 'Holy crap.  Horrible kids, horrible parents', had been rude when she intervened to say they were climbing on art worth $10million. But Ms Theodore, a New York gallery owner who put the photograph on Twitter at the weekend, was not impressed. This afternoon she wrote on Twitter: 'It's easy to say one is anti-establishment as an excuse for bad behaviour when you have the money to do it.' A spokesman for Tate Modern said: 'There is always risk of damage when visitors . touch works of art, but the sculpture has been checked by Tate’s conservation . team and no damage has been caused on this occasion.' Donald Judd, who died in 1994, is hailed as one of the most significant post-war American artists, and his Untitled 1980 work, made out of steel, aluminium and perspex, is one of his most valuable creations. Not impressed: Gallery owner Ms Theodore made her feelings on the subject clear on Twitter this afternoon .","Sissi Belle Trevor was pictured on work by American artist Donald Judd .

"By . Gerri Peev . Yvette Cooper: The shadow home secretary has revealed that she shouts at her husband Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, in the morning . Hurry up, we’re going to be late! Where’s your swimming kit? And Ed, will you get off that piano! That, according to an impeccable source, is the sound of a typical morning in the Balls household. In a revealing interview, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, explains that husband Ed Balls is not much help on the school run. And it’s not because the shadow chancellor is preoccupied with the nation’s finances. It seems his first priority of the day is his musical repertoire. Miss Cooper admitted she starts the morning by shouting at her husband because he is too busy playing the piano to help get the children ready. She revealed the chaos at the heart of family life in the high- flying couple’s house and said her husband’s timing for piano practice was ‘infuriating’ as it coincided with trying to round up their three children for school. ‘There’s always that sort of morning chaos,’ she said. ‘I think the most stressful time in any parent’s day is that period between 8.20am and 8.40am. It’s just … shouting. ‘You haven’t got them ready, you haven’t got yourself ready and then suddenly there’s a discussion about PE kit, or swimming. Who knew it was swimming today? ‘And Ed has taken to piano practising during that period. It’s infuriating,’ she told the latest edition of Red Magazine. ‘So the shouting now includes shouting at the kids, shouting at myself and shouting at Ed because he is playing the piano – and why is he not helping to find the swimming kit?’ But Miss Cooper managed to get her own back by teasing her husband over the fact that she has achieved a higher piano grade than he has. Mr Balls missed his Grade 3 piano exam to respond to Chancellor George Osborne’s autumn statement. But Miss Cooper said: ‘I just say I learned to Grade 5. I don’t actually put fingers to the keyboard to demonstrate how much I’ve forgotten.’ Tinkling the ivories: Balls at the piano. Ms Cooper said her husband's timing for piano practice was 'infuriating' Despite his lack of help in the mornings, Miss Cooper conceded that her husband is the chef in the household while she resorts to ‘ready meals or beans on toast’. In a surprising admission, the usually no-nonsense Miss Cooper said she would love to appear on Strictly Come Dancing. ‘That would be wonderful,’ she said but added: ‘I’m sure I’d be hopeless.’ Miss . Cooper also spoke of the challenge of keeping her children safe online, . admitting they had to show her how to filter out porn. She said: ‘Let’s be realistic. I have to ask my kids how to use the parental controls. ‘They are far more techno-savvy than I am. So the reality is they have to be resilient.’ On online porn, she said ‘it’s people’s choice. The interesting thing, talking to teenagers, is how much of this is still as being about girls, when it should be about boys and girls.’ Miss Cooper also renewed her attack on David Cameron, saying he still had a ‘women problem’. She said House of Commons analysis showed that of the £14 billion in government cuts and pay and pension changes, £11 billion had come from women. ‘You have three-quarters of the money from women because the biggest cuts are in things like tax credits or child benefits, which are predominately paid to women, whereas things like the top-rate tax cut actually benefit more men. So I don’t think it is any surprise that David Cameron has a women problem.’ The full interview with Miss Cooper appears in the March 2014 issue of Red, on sale January 31.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . An Ohio K9 handler gave an emotional eulogy about his partner of 12 years - a black German Shepherd named Jet. At a service on Monday, Patrol Officer Antonio Colon was joined by friends and colleagues as he said goodbye to the police dog. The dog had been a loyal companion to Colon throughout its career, but when Jet's health rapidly deteriorated last month, the officer knew it was time to say goodbye. Scroll down for video . Farewell: Antonio Colon salutes his K9 partner and loyal companion Jet at a service to pay tribute to the dog . Best buddy: Jet cuddles up to his handler, Antonio, who had planned for the pair to retire in September . At the service on Monday, a piper played as Colon carried an urn containing Jet's ashes into the police union hall in Cleveland. Loyal: Jet could always be counted on . Then, with a voice cracking with emotion, he paid tribute to his K9 partner, who had been 'like my son, my brother and my best friend'. Jet, who had been partnered with Colon in the narcotics department since the dog joined Cleveland police, was 'beyond loyal', he added. Sergeant Doug Champion, who accompanied Colon to the vet's when it was time for the dog to be euthanized, said Jet never backed down for a fight. As they arrived at the vet's office, Jet relieved himself on Champion's boot, the sergeant told Cleveland.com. 'I don't know if that was Jet showing me . what he thought of my supervisory skills, or a sign . that he and Tony had done some extra training,' he said. Jet's passing marked the end of an era for his handler, Colon, who is due to retire from his position in the K9 unit after 25 years' service. He had planned to enjoy his retirement with his K9 partner, which made the loss even harder. 'He showed me more love, forgiveness and . understanding than any human had shown me,' Colon said. 'I made more . friends with Jet by my side than at any other time on this job. He made . me feel as if we were movie stars, and that the city was our stage.' He added that although Jet, who was 13 and a half, could strike fear in the heart of criminals, the dog adored and was adored by children. Moving: Members of the K9 unit joined Antonio and his family for a memorial to Jet . Last summer, the dog had been a popular fixture with children in the city, as he took part in the Pizza with the Police sessions. 'His demeanor was so calm and kind, and the childrenâ€™s faces would just light up when they got to pet him,' a spokesman for Cleveland Police said on their Facebook page. At the memorial, Colon described Jet as his 'shadow', adding: 'Everywhere I went, he had to be right there with me, by my side.' For 12 years Jet had accompanied him to work and home, and the officer's family, who joined him at the service, appeared just as upset as Colon.","Ohio officer Antonio Colon holds memorial for police dog Jet .

"By . Andrew Levy . Michael Gove was accused of jeopardising Britain’s Olympic legacy yesterday as it emerged he allowed schools to sell off 50 playing fields over the past three years. On average, 17 are closed every year, most in Conservative local authorities. The figures make a mockery of a pledge to protect them in the Coalition agreement. Olympic dreams: There is growing anger that 50 school playing fields have been sold over the past three years, which could jeopardise the future of British sport, said Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg . This followed the huge outcry over Labour disposing of playing fields at the slightly higher rate of 28 each year. Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg accused the Government of damaging sport. He said: ‘David Cameron and Michael Gove are putting the Olympic legacy at risk. ‘Parents will be shocked that the Tory-led Government is still selling off playing fields.’ Details of plans to scrap rules on schools keeping a set amount of playing field space for team sports emerged on the eve of last year’s Olympics. New rules that came into force months later stated only that ‘suitable’ outdoor space should be provided for sport and play. Education secretary Michael Gove is under fire after it emerged that 17 school fields are closed every year, most in Conservative local authorities. At the time, 35 applications to dispose of playing fields had been made – 30 by Tory councils, four by Labour-run authorities and one by a Lib Dem council. The Education Secretary initially said 21 had been approved – only to have to apologise and say the figure was actually 30. The deals included the sale of a football pitch to a developer by Barton Peveril Sixth Form College in Hampshire, whose former pupils include gold medal-winning cyclist Dani King. Elliott School in Putney, south London, was allowed to sell five acres of fields with six tennis courts, a football pitch and a playground to make way for luxury housing. Several sales have gone ahead against the advice of the independent playing fields panel. Only five have been rejected by the Department for Education. The DfE claims the rule change is needed to allow more school places to be created quickly. But Labour has warned that cuts in schools’ capital budgets are leading to ‘salami slicing’ of school pitches. A total of 242 playing fields were sold off under Tony Blair or Gordon Brown from November 2001 to May 2010. The DfE said last night that about two-thirds of disposals followed the closure or merger of schools. A spokesman added: ‘The number of playing fields approved for disposal by the Government is falling.’ Several sales have gone ahead against the advice of the independent playing fields panel. She said it was schools and their local authorities that proposed to convert this ‘often surplus or unused land to invest in sport or education’. The charity Fields in Trust said the DfE was now more ‘transparent’ about the decisions. But chief executive Helen Griffiths warned: ‘The focus now must be on ensuring that the growing body of [independently run] academies and free schools are subject to the same processes as local  education authority maintained schools. ‘There is great potential for playing field losses in these academic institutions to fall below the radar.’","Michael Gove under fire for jeopardising legacy from London 2012 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Environment Secretary Owen Paterson today refused to back David Cameron's claim that the devastating storms which have battered Britain are linked to climate change. The Tory minister, who is widely viewed as a climate change sceptic, seemed unable to bring himself to endorse the Prime Minister's view that global warming was to blame for the 60mph winds, heavy rain and floods which have swept across most of the country. It came as the Met Office insisted it was too early to say what was the cause of the terrible weather, amid warnings that Britain must be braced for sub-zero temperatures and snow this weekend. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson declined to repeat David Cameron's claim that the floods have been caused by climate change . The Environment Agency has issued more than 300 flood warnings or alerts for England and Wales, with the majority in the Midlands and South. Wales and South-West England are to endure more rain today and tomorrow, which will return again on Sunday - with a high chance of snow in the North. Rising rivers include the Hampshire Avon through Wiltshire, Hampshire and Dorset, the Parrett in Somerset and the Severn through the Midlands. Yesterday Mr Cameron told MPs: 'We are seeing more abnormal weather events. ‘Colleagues across the House can argue about whether that is linked to climate change or not. I very much suspect that it is.' Today Labour MP Phil Wilson asked Mr Paterson if he agreed with the PM's view that the recent spell of severe weather was man made, prompting a roar of laughter on the opposition benches. Mr Paterson side-stepped the question, replying: 'What the Prime Minister said is we should look at the practical measures we're taking, and I entirely endorse his questions.' Meanwhile, the Met Office insisted it is too early to say whether climate change is behind the storms that have wreaked havoc across Britain. Watch out: The Environment Agency has issued more than 300 flood warnings or alerts for England and Wales, with the majority in the Midlands and South . Wet: The rain will continue this weekend, as river levels continue to rise in counties including Wiltshire, Hampshire, Dorset, Somerset and the Midlands . Meteorologists said that no scientific research had been carried out into the cause of the heavy rain and floods that has blighted much of the country over Christmas and the New Year. Dan Williams, a Met Office spokesman, said: 'No attribution study has been done, so you can't make a definitive statement about how more or less likely the recent flooding has become because of climate change.' Mr Williams said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the world leader on research into climate change - had produced a report last year linking some types of 'extreme weather' with man-made climate change. 'So if you are talking about extreme weather globally there has been some observed increase in some types of extreme weather and there is some evidence, depending on which types of extreme weather you are talking about, of a link between man-made climate change and some types of extreme weather,' he said. Crumpled: Tony Martyn's wrecked Citroën Berlingo in the sea off the Cornish coast at East Portholland . Response team: An underpass near Cowcaddens subway station in Glasgow, Scotland, being pumped out by emergency services after a water mains failed . Mr Williams said that this research was supported by attribution studies which looked at specific weather-related events, such as Hurricane Sandy, which devastated the Caribbean and North America, or a drought in East Africa. 'They can see how that event is more or less likely because of human influence,' he said. 'What those attribution studies have shown is that some events have become more likely and there are some events where there is no evidence of any human influence at all - it's a mixed bag really. 'You can't say definitively that an event is caused by climate change and climate change only because we have always had extreme weather. 'But the chances of extreme weather occurring may have altered because of climate change. 'So it would be consistent with the picture we have seen of increasing rainfall in the UK over the past few decades.' Communities along the Thames throughout Surrey, Berkshire and Oxfordshire have also been warned they are at risk of flooding in the coming days. Fresh fall: A snow plough clears the A66 in County Durham, following overnight snow. More snow is expected for parts of the North this weekend . Flooding continues on parts of the Somerset Levels, and there remains a risk of flooding from groundwater in Dorset, Wiltshire and West Sussex. And this weekend conditions could worsen when temperatures plummet and snow arrives. Laura Caldwell of MeteoGroup said: ‘There will be rain across a lot of England and Wales today and also showers in Scotland and Northern Ireland. 'It will all begin to clear throughout tomorrow before dry and sunny weather arrives at the weekend. ‘With that though we will have colder temperatures, dropping to below freezing on Saturday evening. '(We will also have) snow across the hills in north England and reaching the ground in Scotland. But come Sunday, the rain will return in the south.’","Hundreds of flood warnings and alerts placed across the country .

"By . Luke Garratt . A Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer has been fired by the Associated Press news agency after admitting he had doctored one of his photos from the Syrian civil war. The photographer, Narciso Contreras had manipulated a photo of a Syrian rebel by using a common Photoshop technique called 'cloning' in order to remove a fellow reporter's camera out of the picture, before sending it to an AP photo desk. The technique involves copying another piece of the photo and moving it to another area, giving photographers the ability to erase portions of pictures. In this case it was a colleague's camera. Spot the difference: In the original image (top photo), a fellow journalist's video camera is visible on the ground in the left corner of the frame. Freelance photographer Narciso Contreras altered the image (lower photo) by cloning another part of the background, before sending it to an AP photo desk . AP does allow its photographers to use software to lighten or darken photographs, what they call 'minor adjustments', but according to its ethics policy, only these small types of changes are acceptable. Contreras, who shared a Pulitzer Prize for his images of the war, said that the photo was the only one he has manipulated. He said: 'I took the wrong decision when I removed the camera. I feel ashamed about that. 'You can go through my archives and you can find that this is a single case that happened probably at one very stressed moment, at one very difficult situation. 'But it happened to me, so I have to assume the consequences.' The Associated Press has since cut ties with the award-winning photographer, whose work has been featured in publications across the world, such as The New York Times, Der Spiegel, TIME, and The Washington Post. Narciso Contreras has been working for AP to cover the conflict since before 2012 and has had many photographs reach critical acclaim, such as this picture of a rebel sniper aiming at a Syrian army position in the Jedida district of Aleppo . Contreras won awards for his photographs which provided an insight into both the war's impact on civilians (left) and soldiers in the conflict. Residents walk past damaged buildings (right) due to heavy fighting between Free Syrian Army fighters and government forces in Aleppo, Syria, in a picture taken in October 2012 . Narciso Contreras, the Mexican photojournalist during his time working for Zuma Press in 2011. He is lying down resting on a gurney inside a hospital after he was reportedly beaten by Indian police in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian administered Kashmir, India . Since the revelation, AP has examined 494 photos taken by Contreras, but did not find any other alterations. This is not the first time that AP has had to pull photographs because of digital manipulation. In 2011, they pulled an entire series because a photographer used editing software to remove his shadow from an image. Santiago Lyon, AP's Vice President and Director of Photography, said: 'APâ€™s reputation is paramount and we react decisively and vigorously when it is tarnished by actions in violation of our ethics code. Speaking about Contreras, Lyon said: 'Deliberately removing elements from our photographs is completely unacceptable and we have severed all relations with the freelance photographer in question. 'He will not work for the AP again in any capacity.' Another high profile case of camera trickery involving the Syrian war happened earlier this month with an arranged photograph which had both nothing to do with the Syrian civil war, or any grounding in truth. A photo taken by Abdul Aziz al Otaibi in Saudi Arabia went viral on the internet, floating around with the caption 'Syrian orphan sleeping between his parents'. Photographer Al-Otaibi has since said he was shocked by how the picture had been 'twisted', because he made it very clear it was not real when he posted it on Facebook.

"By . Luke Garratt . A British holidaymaker has discovered a type of spider that bears a striking resemblance to the creepy character Jack Skellington. Debbie Hall, from Cleethorpes in Lincolnshire, spotted the spooky-looking bug while she was visiting the Turrialba area of Costa Rica. Both spiders and living skeletons are likely to give you a fright on their own, but a mish-mash of the Nightmare Before Christmas character an eight-legged insect makes for one scary-looking creepy-crawly. The white markings on the spider's . predominantly black body make its appearance very much like the . protagonist in Tim Burton's 1993 movie. The spooky critter: The spider's markings might be to make it look more menacing that it actually is, in order for it to ward off attackers or predators . The markings (left) bear a striking resemblance . to the Jack Skellington character (right) from Nightmare before . Christmas, Tim Burton's 1993 animated classic . A similar case, perhaps terrifying in a different way, is when a photographer in India was left speechless after he spotted the face of Hitler on the back of a common stink bug. The snapper was getting some pictures of the local wildlife in his back garden when he spotted the bug had an incredibly peculiar pattern resembling the German ex-dictator. Subbu Sullia, 29, from Bangalore, India noticed almost straight away that the markings on the insect's back resembled the hair line and tiny mustache that made German leader's face so recognisable. He kept trying to get the bugs best side, but was unable to capture it's most fÃ¼hrer-like pose because it kept running away.","Skeleton spider was found in Costa Rica by a tourist from Lincolnshire .

"By . Emma Reynolds . A father who lost his entire family in a tower block fire said today that he was told they would be 'fine' by a man in uniform as he tried to get close to the flat. Brazilian Rafael Cervi said his way into the block in Camberwell, south London, was barred by police and he was forced to wait helplessly below. His wife Dayana Francisquini, 26, his step-daughter Thais, six, and his son Felipe, three, all died in the tragedy of July 2009. Tragedy: Rafael Cervi spoke today of his wife Dayana Francisquini, step-son Filipe, three, and daughter Thais, six, who died in the fire . 'How can I go on?': Rafael Cervi arrives at the inquest into his wife and childrens' death in the Camberwell fire today where he spoke movingly of his loss . Tearful: Mr Cervi paid tribute to his wife, who 'loved to dance', and their two children during the inquest into the blaze at Lambeth Town Hall . 'Everything that I built, everything that I dreamed of was over in three hours,' Mr Cervis told the 'super inquest' into the deaths of six people in the fire. He fought back tears as he told the hearing at Lambeth Town Hall: 'I lost my entire family, my wife and a couple of kids.' Mr Cervi told jurors he met his wife at a Brazilian club when her daughter Thais was three months old. He said his wife 'loved to dance' and was 'never tired' despite looking after two children. He said that, a week later: 'I met the little one, her name was Thais, and after that I couldn’t leave both of them. When I saw her I was sure that this was my dream daughter.' The couple’s son Felipe was 'a little bit naughty, doing crazy things', Mr Cervi told the jury, smiling. Mr Cervi had been working near London Bridge on the day of the fire, and only knew about the blaze when his wife rang him from their 11th-floor flat just before 4.30pm. Grief: Mark Bailey, left, lost his girlfriend Catherine Hickman, 31, right, in the blaze . Heartbroken: Mbet Udoaka lost his wife Helen, 34, and their tiny three-week-old daughter Michelle . Killed: Three-week-old Michelle was the youngest victim to die in the blaze . He called back - the first of . 10 phonecalls - and told her to take the children to the bathroom, which she had said was the least smoky. Mr Cervi alerted her father, who was closer to the 14-storey building in Camberwell at the time, and rushed home in a taxi. But he was stopped by a police officer at a cordon. ‘He told me I cannot pass through,’ said Mr Cervi. ‘I mentioned to him, I have my wife and kids stuck in Flat 81.’ He dialled 999 and tried to reassure his wife on the phone, but said he felt 'useless' that he could not help more. Mr Cervi told the inquest that his wife said someone else who had sought refuge in the flat had left but she couldn’t because 'she had been told to stay inside'. Mr Cervi and his father-in-law Fernando Francisquini watched from the ground and initially reassured Ms Francisquini that the flames did not look as if they were spreading to their flat. However, as things got worse, he told a fireman that his wife said Felipe 'was not OK', and that he thought his son was dying. Billowing smoke: Mr Cervi said he was barred from entering the towerblock by a policeman during the fire . He said he was approached by a man in uniform who told him his wife was 'fine' in the burning block. Mr Cervi said: 'I was standing there, he came and approached me and said, ""I have been talking to your wife on the phone."" I mentioned to him about where she was and he said she needed to stay there. He said he was talking to her and she was fine. 'He came over two times. The last time he came over he said, she is fine. I had spoken to her ten seconds before and said no, she is not fine, she has just hung up on me. 'That was the last time I spoke to him and that is when I figured out he was lying.' Later, he struggled to find out what had happened to his family. He told the jury: 'I was expecting my daughter to be alive... at least one of them. But I couldn’t find them.' Catherine Hickman, 31, also died in the blaze, after being told to stay in her flat by an operator. Ms Hickman was described in court as a talented fashion designer who had made clothes for singer-songwriter Bjork. She had worked for a string of fashion companies and boutiques after graduating from the Winchester School of Art, later working for FCUK, and lived with her hairdresser boyfriend Mark Bailey. Helpless: Mr Cervi said he called his wife ten times and dialled 999 as he and his father-in-law stood below . A family statement read to the inquest said: ‘To describe in words Catherine and her attributes would take us through day and night. ‘Here are just a few: beautiful, kind, loving, warm, genuine, trustworthy, loyal, funny, proper, sweet, pure, classic, talented, unique, and irreplaceable. ‘Catherine lived a London life but was a true country girl at heart.- a life cruelly cut short. All those who knew Catherine are heartbroken.’ Another victim was Helen Udoaka, 34, and her three-week-old daughter Michelle. Mrs Udoaka’s husband Mbet told the hearing that he met his wife in Nigeria in 2003, and they got married four years later. She had a degree in business management but was on maternity leave with 20-day-old Michelle at the time of their deaths. Mr Udoaka was studying for an MBA and worked part-time as a security guard. He told the inquest: 'I have been very traumatised by the loss of both Helen and Michelle. We planned to have two kids as soon as possible. We might have had at least two of them by now. 'Lies': The Brazilian said a . man in uniform told him his family were 'fine' - even after he knew they . were not . 'My life will never be the same again, I can never get over these deaths, over the death of my beautiful Helen and my lovely Michelle. I’m really hoping that one day I will get to see them again - this is what I keep saying to her each time I go to the cemetery.’ Jurors heard Mrs Udoaka rang her husband from their home at around 4.30pm, while he was at work. She told him ‘everywhere was covered with smoke and she couldn’t breathe’, said counsel to the inquest James Maxwell-Scott. The couple spoke at least ten times more until their final conversation at 5.30pm. ‘The last words she said to me were, the smoke is too much, she can’t bear it anymore, and Michelle, our daughter, is going to heaven,’ he said. ‘She said, if I didn’t see her again, then she’s going to heaven. Then the line went silent.’ Eno Udoaka, a cousin of Mr Udoaka's, told jurors he had lived with the couple several years earlier. He rang Mrs Udoaka just moments before she died. 'I could hear everyone coughing in the background,’ he said. ‘She said she and the bbay couldn’t breathe any more - the smoke was too great and the fire was coming near. ‘She said to tell Mbet, ""I love him, Michelle loves him"".’","Rafael Cervis said his way into the block was barred by a policeman .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . The woman featured in a photograph that shocked the world last year - that shows her giving birth on the lawn of a medical clinic after she was refused treatment by health officials - has made a full recovery and is in perfect health, as is her five-month-old son, Sabino. Additionally, the attention her shocking photo received has inspired women's rights activists across the globe to end what they call a pattern of poor . indigenous Mexican women being turned away from hospitals while in . labor, forcing them to give birth on lawns, patios or parking lots. The shocking image, taken in October by a passerby, . shows 29-year-old Irma Lopez , who is of Mazatec ethnicity, squatting . after giving birth, her face contorted in pain and her tiny newborn son . still bound by the umbilical cord and lying on the ground. Healthy: Irma Lopez and her son Sabino went through labor on the lawn of a medical clinic that turned her away . At the time the photo was taken, Lopez was sitting on a patch of grass outside a medical center that had refused to treat her. On Thursday, women's rights advocates sought international help to fix the troublesome pattern of women being turned away from medical clinics. Activists working in villages in southern Mexico say they have documented at least 20 recent cases of women giving birth outside hospitals whose staff claimed there was no room. Photos and video of some incidents posted on social media sites have prompted outrage in Mexico and around the world. Mexican health officials have said the cases are isolated and unavoidable due to overcrowding and limited resources at some rural health centers. But women's advocates appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on Thursday, saying they believe there is a systemic problem of prejudice and callousness toward indigenous women in the Mexican public health system. Scandalous: This disturbing photo of Irma Lopez, 29, squatting in pain outside a Mexican health clinic after giving birth without help from the staff caused outrage after appearing on the front page of La Razon de Mexico . 'These are not isolated cases. We . have a pattern. We are not talking about one woman. There are many and . nothing is being done to solve the problem,' said Regina Tames, director . of the Reproductive Choice Information Group, a non-governmental . organization based in Mexico City. Pablo . Kuri Morales, deputy health secretary for preventive care, said most of . the births in Mexico's health system occur without problems but he . acknowledged that hundreds of women here still die every year during or . immediately after they give birth, giving the country a maternal death . rate more than three times that in the U.S. This . is something the government of Mexico is worried about. Our stand now . is to reject, disapprove and fight with all our strength any form of . violence against women,' Kuri Morales said. Many of these problems were ignored until the photo of Lopez was shared across the world - as well as across Mexico. Happy mother: Irma Lopez stands next to her newborn son Salvador at a clinic in the town of Jalapa de Diaz, Mexico, where a health center director was suspended for failing to help her during birth . The . picture upset many Mexicans when it was widely shared on Twitter and . Facebook and shown on the front pages of some national dailies. News . about the outdoor birth prompted two other women to go public with . their own harrowing tales of having their babies born outside the same . center. Less than a week later, authorities fired the director of . another hospital after a video showing a woman giving birth in a waiting . room was posted on YouTube. Television news channels in Oaxaca state . showed a woman having a baby in the dark courtyard outside the General . Hospital of Huajuapan de Leon. In another case, an 18-year-old . indigenous woman gave birth in the bathroom of a shelter next to a . hospital after allegedly being refused medical care. 'This . probably has been going on for a while,' said Tames. 'What's new is . that people are outraged and want to do something about it.' Earlier . this month, President Enrique Pena Nieto urged hospitals not to refuse . care to women in labor. Also, Oaxaca Gov. Gabino Cue recently announced a . $550,000 investment to set up 50 new delivery rooms across the state. But . just this week, local media reported the case of a woman feeling . contractions who had been sent away by a hospital and was only . re-admitted after photographers began arriving. None . of the women or babies have died or suffered from major health . problems, but Tames said authorities shouldn't wait for a death before . adding more resources to understaffed rural clinics and hospitals. Most . of the cases that have gone public have occurred in Oaxaca. The largely . rural southern state is among Mexico's poorest and suffers from high . rates of obstetrical problems including preeclampsia, a condition that . causes high blood pressure in women during pregnancy that can lead to . kidney or liver failure. A . handful of similar cases have been reported in Puebla and Chiapas, also . states with large indigenous populations and high rates of obstetrical . problems and maternal deaths. The . human rights commission will study the cases heard Thursday and can . send resolutions that are non-binding based on what it finds. Although . authorities fired the director of the first health center to draw . attention to the problem, the Oaxaca state medical regulatory committee . weeks later ruled that Irma Lopez's case was not the result of . negligence and called the birth an unforeseeable event. Lopez hopes the attention her case has brought to the state will help lead to better care for indigenous pregnant women. 'I hope that we find the support in the end. We are peasants and housewives.'

"By . Tara Brady . Rio Smedley was just two years old when he was beaten to death by Daniel Rigby in April, 2012 . A police watchdog has said officers failed to properly investigate a vicious thug’s assault on his pregnant girlfriend just weeks before he beat her toddler son to death. Rio Smedley was just two years old when he was beaten to death by Daniel Rigby in April, 2012. Just a few weeks earlier, Rigby had been arrested on suspicion of assaulting Rio’s pregnant mum Kirsty Smedley but the case was dropped. Today the Independent Police Complaints Commission ruled that, although the death could not have been prevented, the investigation into the assault had been plagued by errors. One PC failed to check if CCTV existed of the pair walking near her home in Bolton after the assault. He also failed to check if neighbours or other witnesses had seen anything suspicious. The officer failed to question Rigby about his criminal history, make enquiries about Rio or pass on information about his mother’s injuries. The IPCC say the PC should now face disciplinary action. Rigby, of Dorset Avenue, Tyldesley, was jailed for life in 2012 for murder after carrying out the horrific attack while Smedley was out buying him cannabis. Smedley, from Bolton, was found guilty of allowing or causing the death of the child at her home in Cheriton Drive, Breightmet, Bolton and was jailed for four years. She claimed her son had fallen down the stairs but analysis of the injuries showed that was a lie.His liver had split in two and he had suffered 91 separate injuries. Just a few weeks before Rio's death Daniel Rigby (right) had been arrested on suspicion of assaulting Rio’s pregnant mum Kirsty Smedley (left) Rigby had been arrested on suspicion of assaulting Rio¿s pregnant mum Kirsty Smedley but the case was dropped . The criticised PC and another officer, a sergeant, have already been subject to ‘management action’ by GMP over the way they reviewed the assault allegation before the decision was made to take no further action. IPCC Commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone said: 'While it cannot be said that if the officers had chosen to take a different course of action against Daniel Rigby Rio Smedley would still be alive today, there were a number of shortcomings identified during our investigation. 'Reports of domestic violence must be treated seriously and acted upon thoroughly, particularly those that involve children who may themselves be at risk.'","Rio Smedley was just two years old when he was beaten to death by Daniel Rigby in April, 2012 .

It was only when the doctors in Bacau County carried out an X-ray that they found the metal fork lodged inside his esophagus. Doctors have refused to operate on a man who has a fork stuck in his throat after swallowing it for a bet . It was only when questioned by doctors and he was confronted with the X-ray images that the embarrassed man admitted he had taken part in a bet with friends to prove how tough he was. And incredibly, doctors who had little tolerance for the foolish prank told the man they did not have time to remove it, and ordered him to wait and see if it came out the natural way. Calincescu said: 'I had been drinking and I bet with my friend that I could swallow the fork without getting hurt. Radu Calincescu, 25, complained to doctors of pain and an uncomfortable feeling when he swallowed, but neglected to mention that he had also swallowed a fork earlier in the day . 'I put the fork in my mouth and managed to swallow it. 'At first it didn't hurt, but after some minutes I experienced intense pain that just got worse, and I was forced to go to hospital.' Luckily for Calincescu, the fork was not disturbing his airway or threatening any vital organs and at the moment does not need an emergency operation. He said: 'I was discharged and told I should wait and see if the fork will take its natural course and make its way through my body and leave the natural way. 'But I have to come back in a few days to see if the fork has moved. If it reaches my stomach and looks like it could pierce the lining I will need an operation. 'I realise now it was a very stupid thing to do. I don't think I will be taking part in any bets for a while.'","Radu Calincescu complained to doctors of pain and uncomfortable feeling .

"By . Associated Press . and Meghan Keneally . A snowstorm is tearing across the shores of the Northeast and left more than a thousand people on the islands off the coast of Massachusetts without power. Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard were among the worst hit, with winds of up to 80 miles per hour whipping up to 10 inches of snow across the largely deserted streets. Some meteorologists feared that what started as a late-season snow storm could accelerate into a Category 3 hurricane. Rude awakening: Wind-driven waves crash on a sea wall in Scituate, Massachusetts on Wednesday morning . Whiteout: The island of Nantucket was hit with up to ten inches of snow and winds that reached up to 70 miles per hour on Wednesday . It has been dubbed a 'bombogenesis', a term meant to imply the storm will have the wrath of both a bomb and cyclonegenesis, or the beginning of a cyclone. This category of storm draws its power from picking up speed while over water. Less snow was expected farther to the north and east in Massachusetts, with the Boston area getting just an inch or two. Schools . across Cape Cod closed amid the 'white out' conditions, while ferry and . flight service to the islands were cancelled as early as Tuesday night . ahead of the Wednesday morning storm. Out at sea: The storm, dubbed a 'bombogenesis' did not hit major cities because it's center was so far out in the Atlantic (pictured) but islands off the coast of Massachusetts were right in the line of fire . Dramatic jump: Ferries from the mainland were cancelled starting late Tuesday and the service disruption continued through Wednesday as water levels continued to rise . View from above: The storm is believed to have picked up much of its strength from the winds over the ocean . On Maine's eastern tip, Hancock and Washington counties could get 8 to 16 inches of snow. Governor Paul LePage ordered state offices in both counties closed Wednesday morning as flurries started falling. Blizzard warnings were in effect in both Maine and Massachusetts. The Red Cross has opened a warming station at Nantucket High School. The National Weather Service also warned of coastal flooding and significant beach erosion along the Massachusetts coast and wind gusts causing scattered power outages in eastern Maine. The government agency's Boston office reported that waves in Nantucket exceeded 8 feet by 8am in the morning and continued to rise. Steering clear: The town's historic Main Street was deserted except for Department of Public Works vehicles . Not spring yet: The late-season storm covered Nantucket with snow and forced residents to 'hole up' White out: This Nantucket resident ignores the warnings from government agencies to stay inside . National Grid, the local power provider, reported that 1,566 customers in Nantucket had lost power by 7.30am. An update just before 10am reported that Boston Harbor recorded waves of more than 12 feet as a result of the wind. Local blogger Holly Finigan told MailOnline that she was 'holed up' in her home on the island's eastern coast, and the beachfront town was now being pummeled by water. 'There are insane winds. There's still a lot of snow but it's kind of drifting because of the winds,' the Nantucket BlACKbook author told MailOnline Wednesday morning. 'There's easily zero visibility.' Bracing for the storm: Towns like Scituate on the mainland coast of Massachusetts were hit mostly with strong winds and water from the sea that was brought up due to the wind . Securing the ships: Marina employees in Chatham check on the boats that they had been tasked with caring for over the winter as the storm was expected to carry through Wednesday . Sailor's fear: Boats were docked in Hyannis harbor on Wednesday in preparation for the storm . Make way: A snow plow goes down Main Street in Hyannis as authorities warned residents to avoid going outdoors . Jason Graziadei reported . that earlier reports of 70 mile per hour winds had been blown away by . 10am with new figures that put the number closer to 83 miles per hour in . some of the more deserted areas of the island near Monomoy. Those . dangerous conditions extended into the mainland, as the National . Weather Service- Boston urged all residents to stay inside and avoid any . travel due to the blizzard warning. The storm comes days after the official end of one of the snowiest winters on record. It began heading up the Interstate 95 corridor on Tuesday, dropping snowflakes onto Washington, D.C.'s budding cherry trees and dusting government buildings in northern Virginia. Almost 4 inches of snow was reported at Washington's Dulles International Airport and 1.7 inches at Reagan National Airport. Keeping covered: A woman in New Bedford, Massachusetts hides her face as she ventures outdoors . Ghost town: The port town of Hyannis was completely empty as all ferries running to and from Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket have been suspended due to the storm . Deceptive: The stretches at the coastline did not appear to be drowned in snow but that was because the bustling winds in those areas stopped the snow from collecting . As . the storm moved north, it dropped about 6 inches of snow in southern . Delaware's Sussex County and blanketed parts of southern New Jersey, . where six and a half inches of snow was reported in Cape May, five and a . half inches in Middle Township and 4 inches at Atlantic City . International Airport. Taunton, . Massachusetts-based meteorologist Matt Doody was unfazed by the . prospect of more snow during a seemingly relentless season. 'Here in New England, we're generally used to dealing with weather like this,' he said early Wednesday. Although . spring began a week ago, it's not unusual to have storms so late in the . year, said weather service spokesman Bill Simpson. Frozen: Nantucket writer Holly Finigan was nearly blown away when she went up to Sankaty Lighthouse which overlooks the island's eastern shores . Snowed in: A square in the town of Sconset, which is largely made up of beach houses, shows the depth of snow . Far cry from it's name: Windows on Beach Street in the Nantucket town of Sconset are completely covered with snow as winds in the area climbed above 80 miles per hour . The Boston area got more than 2 inches of snow in an April storm last year and was blanketed with almost 2 feet the same month in 1997. 'I can't wait for it to warm up,' 20-year-old Dajuan Davis of Boston, a massage school student bundled up in a heavy jacket, said Tuesday. 'I'm from North Carolina. I'm not used to this cold weather.' Where the snow falls and how much will depend on the storm's track. But wind and temperatures of 20 to 25 degrees below normal were expected to cover the Mid-Atlantic states and New England as the storm traveled from southern Virginia to Maine.","Blizzard hit the coast of Massachusetts early Wednesday and conditions carried up to Maine .

"By . Huge Duncan Economics Correspondent . Fear: Robert Chote, who heads the Office for Budget Responsibility, has warned that Britain is on the verge of a dangerous housing bubble . Britain is on the verge of a dangerous housing bubble, the Treasury’s chief watchdog warned yesterday. Soaring property prices are being inflated by speculators banking on further gains, according to Robert Chote, who heads the Office for Budget Responsibility. ‘With very rapid house price increases in some parts of the country you might see bubbly activity where people are willing to buy stuff off plan or not intend to live in it,’ Mr Chote told MPs. Prince Charles gave a separate warning yesterday that soaring prices in London will drive a generation of young people out of the capital. He said the dream of home ownership was becoming further and further out of reach for swathes of workers. The average price of a home in London is expected to jump from £458,000 to £650,000 over the next six years. ‘This isn’t sustainable and risks driving away talented young individuals who are starting their careers in London and spending most of their income on rent,’ said the prince. ‘Home ownership for this generation is seemingly becoming further and further out of reach.’ Official figures show the price of the average UK home hit £254,000 in January – a rise of 6.8 per cent in a year. Prices were up 13.2 per cent in London, 7.1 per cent in the South East and 6.9 per cent in Wales. First-time buyers paid a record £190,000 to get on the housing ladder in January. Estate agents are now organising open days in some hotspots to meet demand and many homes go to auction-style sealed bids. ‘Open days are necessary with the feeding frenzy out there,’ said Peter Rollings of estate agents Marsh & Parsons. Soaring: Official figures show the price of the average UK home hit £254,000 in January - a rise of 6.8 per cent in a year . House hunters: First-time buyers paid a record £190,000 to get on the housing ladder in January . Ed Mead, of Douglas & Gordon, . another London agency, said: ‘Any estate agent in London has buyers . coming out of their ears. What they are all fighting for is sellers.’ Mr . Chote told the Treasury select committee the surge in prices was partly . down to soaring demand, driven by rising confidence, increased lending, . and government schemes such as Help to Buy – all combined with lack of . supply. He added: ‘You can . explain the increase in house prices by fundamentals without having to . resort to saying there is a bubble going on. Worry: Prince Charles gave a separate warning yesterday that soaring prices in London will drive a generation of young people out of the capital . Concern: The Prince, pictured on a visit to Ham in Surrey yesterday, said the dream of home ownership was becoming further and further out of reach for swathes of workers . ‘That . doesn’t mean to say there may not be some bubbly components to what is . going on in the housing market in particular parts of the country.’ A . report from the Home Builders Federation this week showed that Britain . is now one million homes short of meeting its housing needs. The . independent OBR expects house prices to rise by more than 30 per cent in . the next five years. Mr . Chote insisted it was not ‘taking a view that house prices are over or . undervalued’ and said house price inflation should cool from 8.5 per . cent this year to 3.7 per cent in 2017 and 2018. Demand: A report from the Home Builders Federation this week showed that Britain is now one million homes short of meeting its housing needs . Steve Nickell, an economist who sits . on the OBR with Mr Chote, said: ‘A bubble arises when demand is being . driven by people wanting to get in because of expectations of price . growth rather than for somewhere to live. ‘The . house price to income ratio has been growing for the last 40 years but . that cannot go on forever because everything you consume would become . housing and there would be nothing else left.’ But . David Ruffley, a Tory MP on the Treasury committee, said forecasters . always expect a ‘benign return to equilibrium’ and fail to predict the . cycle of boom and bust.","Office for Budget Responsibility says speculators are inflating rising prices .

"By . Lizzie Parry . John Anthony Fox was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to his bull dog. He claimed he was 'play fighting' with the dog . A yob ferociously punched his pet bulldog in the head before kicking the animal in the stomach claiming he was 'play fighting'. John Anthony Fox, of Gorton, claims the RSPCA wants to 'get at him' by taking his 'special dogs'  Diego and Kiara away from him. The 31-year-old was found guilty in his absence of causing unnecessary suffering to one dog while failing to meet the needs of another, at Manchester Magistrates' Court today. When Fox visited the housing offices of Eastland Homes in Openshaw, staff witnessed him punching and kicking his American bulldog in an 'aggressive and ferocious manner'. Anna McDonald, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said a Staffie puppy also owned by Fox, was later found to be suffering from an untreated skin condition. She told the court Fox took Diego, an adult bulldog and Kiara, a Staffie puppy to the offices. When Diego began sniffing Kiara, Fox punched him on the head and shouted at him to move away, causing the dog to cower from him. Fox then punched the side of Diego's head again, while complaining he 'could not control him'. He was asked by staff to take the dogs outside, where he hit Diego in the stomach and kicked his back end as he left, leaving the 'shocked and sickened' staff to call the RSPCA. On a visit to Fox's house, RSPCA officer Vicki McDonald found the two dogs and took them to be examined. A vet found Diego to be in good condition but puppy Kiara had a skin condition on her back legs and tail which had not been treated. He said it had probably been there a number of weeks. He found Diego to be of a nice temperament. In interview, Fox denied punching and kicking his dogs. He was found guilty in his absence of . causing unnecessary suffering to a white American bulldog and failing . to meet the needs of a white female Staffordshire bull terrier. Speaking at his Gorton home after the . hearing, Fox said he didn't know he had been found guilty, hadn't . received the summons to court, and said he couldn't read. He said: 'I love my dogs. I would never hurt them. It was just play fighting with that dog, I've done nothing wrong. 'This isn't right. I was using medicine on the rash on Kiara and she was getting better. 'I have fish too and I keep my tanks in impeccable condition."" He said he had paid £2,500 for Diego, who was imported from America, while Kiara was given to him. He added: 'People are just jealous because these are special dogs. 'That's why they want them to be taken off me, to get at me - they are just trying to get at me. 'They need to spend a week with me and see how I treat my dogs. I want them back.' The case was adjourned and Fox will be sentenced at a later date.","John Anthony Fox was seen punching bulldog in the head before kicking him in the stomach .

"By . Sara Malm . A teenage boy who persuaded Prince Charles to take a 'selfie' with him earlier this week, has revealed that it was not the first time he posed with one of Britain's leading men. Joseph Wilson, 17, also convinced David Cameron to take a self-portrait photograph, when the Prime Minister visited his flood-hit home village of Yalding in Kent, last year. Following his success with Mr Cameron, the student was dared by his friends to approach the Prince of Wales, and, unlike when asked by actress Joan Collins, the royal agreed. Prime pose: Joseph Wilson, the Kent teen who earlier this week convinced Prince Charles to pose for a selfie, also has a sneaky snap with David Cameron, taken in December last year . Young Mr Wilson's 'selfie' with Prince Charles was taken earlier this week during his and the Duchess of Cornwall's visit to Yaldin. It has now emerged that Mr Wilson also managed to convince the Prime Minister to pose was confronted by furious flood victims in the village in December. In stark contrast to the Prince of Wales, Mr Cameron’s stern facial expression suggests he’s keen to make a hasty exit. Mr Wilson, who helped rescue people trapped in their homes by paddling around the village in his kayak on Christmas Day, today said: ‘I was with my mates and we were there to get a photo and thought why not try to get a selfie? ‘We managed to take one as he was about to get into the car. It was fun. I was quite surprised he agreed!’ Royal portrait gallery: Joseph Wilson's selfie with Prince Charles which he took this week after his friends dared him to get another 'famous' selfie . Joseph Wilson, 17, who took the selfie with Prince Charles, said: 'He just congratulated us on our role in the floods and thanked us for being so helpful to everyone' Selfie fail:  Prince Charles turns down Joan Collins' request to join Sir Ben Kingsley, Pixie Lott and Luke Evans for a selfie earlier this month . Joseph said: ‘I think everyone was quite glad he came down. ‘Some people were quite angry and not happy about being flooded but it was about focusing on what really needs to be done to get back to normal.’ Earlier this month actress Joan Collins told how she failed to convince the Prince to pose for a star-studded selfie with celebrities including Sir Ben Kingsley, Jeremy Irons and Tess Daly. But on Tuesday Joseph, a sixth form student at the Judd School in Tonbridge, managed to work his magic inside the local church. He said: ‘I just asked Prince Charles for a selfie and he let me. He took it very well and chuckled to himself. ‘I took the photo and he started laughing. He was cool with it. ‘I showed my friends because they dared me to take the photo, so it’s proof I don’t back out of a dare. My friends were quite impressed.'","Joseph Wilson has taken selfies with David Cameron and Prince Charles .

"By . Bianca London . She's a red carpet stalwart renowned for her timeless beauty and glamour and now Joan Collins is using the years of expertise she's accumulated to launch her own beauty range. The 80-year-old, who learned all her techniques from Marilyn Monroe's make-up artist, Allan 'Whitey' Snyder, has curated Joan Collins Timeless Beauty for QVC. The actress hopes her new range of skincare, fragrance and make-up will bring 'sophisticated, attainable and effective beauty to women of all ages'. Absolutely fabulous! Joan Collins, 80, has launched a range of skin creams, fragrances and make-up for QVC . 'Beauty is not just for the young,' she said. 'I believe with a little care and attention any woman can look good through her 40s, 50s, 70s and beyond. 'Looking good and feeling great is the right of every woman no matter how old she is. Beauty is timeless.' Joan's new range, which is priced between £12 - £50, comprises a skincare regime, which she says contains a complex range of cutting edge anti-ageing ingredients that aim to achieve the results she demands for her own skin. There are also lipsticks, nail varnishes, blushers, eyeshadow, fragrances, as well as crystal-embellished tools and accessories. One for the women: The actress hopes her new range of skincare, fragrance and make-up will bring 'sophisticated, attainable and effective beauty to women of all ages' You would never know it to look at . her, but Joan Collins is just weeks away from her 81st birthday. So but what are the secrets behind her age-defying looks? In an exclusive . interview with You magazine, the former Dynasty star revealed: 'I . have always worn sun protection, and have kept my face away from harmful . rays since I was 20. 'You should see me when I wake up  in the morning: my face is so white, it’s like a sheet.' Extensive: Joan's new range, which is priced between £12-£50, comprises a skincare regime, fragrance and make-up . The . five-times-married actress added that it takes her 'no time at all' to . transform into a glamour queen: 'Half an hour for a full face with . lashes. I shove it on - that’s why it’s called slap.' Ms . Collins also works out with a personal trainer twice a week and swims . every day, yet admits: 'I’m  a chocoholic - but I believe that . moderation is the key.' She . adds that she has never defined her style by her age, saying: 'I’ll wear . a leather skirt - even a bikini - if I want to. Clothes are my passion . and I adore them.' For as long as I can remember I’ve loved a diva. I’m not talking about the Britney school of diva-dom. When I was old enough to find out that Elizabeth Taylor had released a fragrance - White Diamonds - I became obsessed with her and it. The beauty of White Diamonds is that once you have a whiff, you can immediately imagine that that is EXACTLY how Elizabeth Taylor smelled: heady, super-sweet and fabulously floral. Fast forward 23 years, and Taylor’s friend Joan Collins is having quite the comeback. She is the face of Snickers, appeared on Benidorm, launched a wig line and now…her very own beauty collection complete with signature fragrance – I AM WOMAN. What I love about it, and White Diamonds for that matter, is that they are unapologetic in their extreme femininity. They totally overthrow the garden salad minimalism that a lot of fragrances now bow to. Simon has tried and tested Joan's I Am Woman perfume and thinks her range would make the perfect mother's day gift . The press release states that: 'Joan believes that fragrance works in maximum effect when applied in layers'. It basically means that not only can you spritz yourself, but you can use the Essence as a room scent or bath fragrance. Just to get a bit technical too, ingredients such as lemon peel, orange zest, rose, jasmine, vanilla and sandalwood make up this scent. You can just picture Joan dousing herself in this. This is exactly how I imagine her to smell. And I love it! I almost forgot to mention the brilliant Contra Time Skincare Collection (£35) too. We are told, ‘Joan’s favourite skincare products in handy travel sizes to keep the most jet-set women looking flawless and fabulous all day, every day. A regime to cleanse, tone, moisturise day and night’. And don’t they just sound fabulous? These are just the most perfect Mother’s Day gift!

"By . Sam Webb . The ‘patronising’ advert . highlighting Budget cuts to bingo and beer duty that Conservative chairman Grant Shapps has been heavily criticised over was actually signed off Chancellor George Osborne, it is claimed. Mr Shapps suffered a ferocious backlash on Twitter after posting the advert in an apparent bid to woo working-class voters. But Tory MPs have claimed the advert was designed in the Treasury and the chairman has been left to take the blame. Blame game: MPs claim that Tory chairman Grant Shapps has been left to take the fall for the controversial poster, which Chancellor George Osborne signed off, it is claimed . 'PR disaster': Grant Shapps tweeted this Tory party advert about beer and bingo cuts in today's Budget . The Tory advert . read: ‘Bingo! Cutting the bingo tax and beer duty to help hardworking . people do more of the things they enjoy.’ Critics said the message reinforced public perceptions that the Conservative Party was out of touch with ordinary voters. Government sources stressed that responsibility for the advert lay with Mr Shapps rather than the Treasury or No 10. Some Tory MPs said the advert – which sparked dozens of internet spoofs . – raised questions about Mr Shapps’s ‘suitability’ for the . job. Scroll down for video . Tweet: The post was immediately slammed as 'ill conceived' by Labour's Ed Miliband . But others said it was ridiculous to blame Mr Shapps. One told the Sunday Telegraph: 'They could easily have defended him and said that it was a team effort, which it was.' Another said Mr Shapps had kept quiet for fear of offending the Chancellor, adding: I'm not Grant's greatest fan but he has been treated pretty shabbily.' The newspaper reported that a small team from Tory HQ went to the treasury to develop the ad with the Chancellor's aides and it was signed off by Lynton Crosby, the Tory election strategist, the Prime Minister's political secretary Stephen Gilbert and Mr Osborne. A spokesman for the Conservative Party refused to comment. After the furore, Downing Street insisted David Cameron had ‘full confidence’ in his party chairman, adding: ‘He thinks he’s doing a good job.’ But one . senior Tory said: ‘When I saw this advert my initial thought was that . it must be a spoof. My reaction when I realised it wasn’t was one of . abject horror.’ Another . exasperated Conservative MP said: ‘Has it boiled down to this? A Grant . Shapps beer and bingo poster? God help us. It’s like they want us to . lose.’ Mr Shapps urged Conservative . supporters to ‘spread the word’. One . Tory source yesterday said the advert had been ‘pulled’ and would never . be used again. But a Tory spokesman insisted it had only ever been . intended for use on  the internet and was never planned as a poster . campaign. The spokesman said: ‘We are quite proud of those tax cuts. We stand by what was said in that advert. ‘There is a misconception about it – it was never going to be a poster campaign, it was just an internet infographic. ‘Some of the Left-wing intelligentsia may not like it but the reaction in bingo halls to the tax cut has been very positive.’ Liberal . Democrat Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander described the wording . of the advert as ‘pretty patronising’ and said it ‘demeans some . quite sensible things’. Nick . Clegg added: ‘I think the tweet was a bit silly, partly because the . issues involved in this Budget were really quite serious.’ London . Mayor Boris Johnson also declined to support the advert. ‘I didn’t . write the blooming thing,’ he said. ‘We’re trying to get across the . message that it’s a Budget for everyone.’ Shadow . Chancellor Ed Balls said George Osborne must be ‘frustrated that his . head of campaigns puts out an advert patronising working people by . saying they’ll be happy with a bingo tax and a beer tax. What nonsense . that is’. Simone Blackwell, a writer on political satire The Thick Of It, said the ad was beyond satire . But Mr Osborne . dismissed the row, saying it had been ‘whipped up by the Labour Party’ to disguise the fact they had nothing to say about the Budget. Mr . Osborne said he had played bingo. The Prime Minister’s spokesman said . he did not know when Mr Cameron had last played bingo – or if he had . ever played it at all. However, he is known to enjoy a pint of real ale. The internet was last night awash with spoof versions of Mr Shapps’s advert, which mock it for stereotyping the working class. One . posted on Twitter reads: ‘Bingo! No tax on pies, flat caps or whippets – . keeping our commitment to patronise the working class. Now get off my . land.’ Another says: ‘Bingo! I say, you there! How is your whippet?

"By . James Tozer . Kathryn Braidford was the last person anyone suspected of stealing dinner money from a primary school . Living in a £650,000 detached house and married to a successful financial adviser, Kathryn Braidford was universally regarded as a pillar of society. So when children's dinner money started going missing at the primary school where she served as a parent-governor, the former British Airways hostess was the last person anyone suspected. Riven by speculation as to which member of staff was the thief, the headmistress installed a hidden camera - and to her horror, the much-respected mother-of-three was captured removing a bag of money which never reached the bank. It emerged she had even helped herself to £170 which the headmistress had put aside for her Lottery syndicate. Questioned as to why she should risk throwing her reputation away for such modest sums, she could only tell police she had been using the money 'to go shopping'. Yesterday the 46-year-old's humiliation was complete as she admitted stealing over £3,400 from the school where she had helped out three days a week in the office. Her 'mortified' husband Steven - the £100,000-a-year managing director of a wealth management company - watched as she admitted seven counts of theft. Braidford, whose elder two children are privately educated, became a governor at Breck Primary School in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, after her younger child began attending classes, a court heard. She later took on a part-time job as an administrative assistant with duties which included being entrusted with cash and cheques sent by fellow parents for school dinners, trips, uniform, social events and out-of-hours clubs. Once a week she was meant to bank the money, Blackpool Magistrates Court was told. 'One day a brown envelope containing £300 for pupils' school photographs went missing,' Jane Yates, prosecuting, said. 'That was followed by the disappearance of £170 which was headmistress Mrs Cheryl Brindle's money for the Lottery syndicate.' The court heard that the school was torn apart, with both staff and pupils under suspicion, so last summer a CCTV system was secretly installed to catch the thief. Braidford admitted stealing over £3,400 from the school where she had helped out three days a week in the office . Braidford's £650,000 detached house she shared with her successful financial adviser husband . Footage showed Braidford removing a bag of money from a desk, and after checks established the cash had never been banked, police searched her detached home 'Normandy' on an exclusive lane in Poulton. She then produced school bank account cheques and paying in slips from a desk. Interviewed by officers, she had used some of the money 'to go shopping and pay for food' She said she had wanted to stop stealing and pay the money back but had not done so. She thought it was school money and she was not robbing an individual. In all, the school lost £3,434 over an eight-month period. In a victim's statement, headmistress Mrs Brindle said she had trusted Braidford and had never suspected she would prove to be the thief. 'I was saddened when I had to install CCTV,' she said. 'This is a primary school and I should be dealing with education and not having an environment where all the staff and pupils were suspects. 'I had real affection for Mrs Braidford and trusted her. I suspected people but not her. 'There was real angst in the school over this period and pupils were no longer allowed to go in areas or complete tasks they formerly did.' Leisa Splaine, defending, said that while Braidford and her husband were 'comfortably off', she had felt 'invisible' and had low self-esteem.","Kathryn Braidford, 46, admitted using the cash to 'go shopping'

"By . Sam Creighton . Harold Shipman murdered between 215 and 250 of his patients over a 27 year period . An investigation has been launched into whether police officers misled the families of Harold Shipman's victims over the disposal their loved ones' remains. Human tissue from 12 of the sick serial killer's victims were kept for more than a decade by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) before allegedly being secretly destroyed, without permission from their families. In response to the allegations, made by a whistleblower currently working within the force, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has launched a probe into the actions of GMP officers surrounding the disposal of the remains. The samples were taken from the 12 . victims to ensure police had the appropriate evidence should Shipman or . his family appeal against his conviction. However, in 2011, police decided to 'respectfully dispose' of the tissue samples without telling the families of the victims. The . remains reportedly belonged to Kathleen Grundy, Joan Melia, Winifred . Mellor, Bianka Pomfret, Ivy Lomas, Marie Quinn, Irene Turner, Jean . Lilley, Muriel Grimshaw, Alice Kitchen, Elizabeth Mellor and Sally . Ashworth. Officers whose actions will be investigated range from the rank of constable up to Greater Manchester Police Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney. Mr Sweeney had been seconded to work on Operation Resolve, the police investigation into the Hillsborough disaster, but has now returned to GMP. Sir Peter Fahy, GMP chief constable, said: 'I have stated before that the decisions dealing with the aftermath of the Shipman investigation were complex and sensitive, our priority was to avoid causing further distress to the families. 'Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney has voluntarily decided to stand down from his work with the Hillsborough Inquiry as part of Operation Resolve while the investigation takes place.

The HQ of Greater Manchester Police, which is facing three IPCC probes after a whistleblower raised concerns . 'This is a personal decision made as he does not want the matter to distract from the operationâ€™s important work. 'I support the need for difficult issues we face to be subjected to scrutiny and for there to be a transparent process for this.' Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney is to be questioned by the IPCC regarding his alleged involvement with the disposal of the remains . He added: 'These are serious allegations but this investigation will not distract us from the hard work of officers and staff every day who are keeping the public safe and tackling criminals.' The whistleblower has levelled a string of other serious allegations against GMP, including claims of corruption, 'cronyism' among senior officers and failures to follow procedure or fully investigate complaints. The watchdog is launching a total of three investigations based on the whistleblower's claims. The first will look into the disposal of Shipman's victims' remains, while a second will assess accusations made against a Detective Chief Inspector, including the alleged unauthorised bugging of a GMP office. The force has told the IPCC that this bugging did not take place. A third probe will also address claims that a sexual abuse case was poorly handled and then the alleged failings covered up. IPCC commissioner Jan Williams said: 'These are serious allegations and the gravity and nature of the allegations, and the fact that they are made against senior officers within the force, means they must be investigated independently. 'We will also look at the wider organisational response by Greater Manchester Police in each of these investigations. 'We know that the families involved will have been through very distressing times, and we will be sensitive to this as we conduct our investigations. 'We have a statutory duty to conduct independent investigations in circumstances such as these, but we will make sure that we communicate with the families and do whatever we can to avoid further distress.' Shipman never expressed remorse for his crimes . Twisted GP Harold Shipman is the UK's most prolific convicted serial killer, having murdered up to 250 of his patients during a 27-year period stretching from 1971. He preyed on the vulnerable and his victims tended to be elderly women living alone. Their ages ranged form 41 to 93 and the murders were mostly committed during home visits, usually with a lethal injection of the painkiller diamorphine. In 2000, Shipman was given 15 life sentences after being found guilty of murdering 15 patients while working in Hyde, Greater Manchester. Throughout his three month trial, Shipman never took responsibility for his crimes, nor gave any clues as to his motivations. Four years later, at the age of 57, he killed himself in his cell in Wakefield Prison, hanging himself with his bedsheets.","Shocking claims brought forward by an officer currently serving within Greater Manchester Police .

'We would like to thank our friends for their continued support and for all the teddies and flowers left as a tribute to Liam outside the family home, which has provided us with some comfort. 'We request privacy and time to grieve at this very sad and difficult time.' Liam lived with his mother Rachael Fee, her partner Nyomi Fee and his seven-year-old twin brothers, JJ and Matthew, in the three-bedroom flat. Relatives said Liam had his 'whole life ahead of him'. Police are treating his death as unexplained . Police at the house in Thornton, Fife, where Liam was found dead on Saturday evening . Police were called after a neighbour heard a woman’s screams coming from the flat. Officers say they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death. A local resident, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I heard a woman’s crying coming from the flat. She sounded hysterical. Then the police arrived.’ Friend Gillian McCusker, 35, said the family seemed happy on the afternoon before the incident. She added: ‘He seemed perfectly fine. They all seemed OK. The twins said hello and Liam smiled at my son. It’s horrible to think that was the last time he’d be seen alive.

"By . Emma Innes . A woman whose stomach was so swollen she thought she was pregnant has told of her horror after discovering she was carrying a 5st ovarian cyst. Lorna Fulton, 44, desperately wanted a family but was left heartbroken when doctors told her, and her husband Stewart, they were unlikely to conceive naturally. Mrs Fulton, from Glasgow, tipped the scales at 21st and wore size 24 dresses. Lorna Fulton had such a swollen stomach (left) she was convinced she was pregnant. She was devastated to be told she actually had a huge ovarian cyst that had to be removed. She is pictured (right) after it was removed . But she refused IVF treatment and instead threw herself into slimming to a healthier weight in the hope of conceiving. However, in August last year Mrs Fulton was baffled when she struggled to even fit into a bigger size 26 and her waistline continued to expand despite months of dieting and losing 2st. She rushed to her GP hoping her growing bump was a miracle baby, but after a pregnancy test came back negative she was referred to specialists who discovered a huge ovarian cyst. She said: ‘Stewart and I had almost given up hope of having children, but when our doctor suggested IVF, we decided not to go down that route and hoped it would happen on its own. ‘At 21st I knew I had to do something about my weight to help my chances. ‘So, I joined a diet class and started eating a healthier diet and within a few months I'd lost 2st. During surgery to remove the cyst, Mrs Fulton had to have 32 litres of fluid drained from her stomach. She also had to have a hysterectomy. She is pictured after the cyst was removed . ‘I went out to buy a new outfit to celebrate. I had been a size 24 so I picked up a size 22, hoping it would now fit comfortably. ‘But I couldn't get into it as around my middle was too big and I had to go up to a size 26. ‘It was so noticeable that people at work thought I was pregnant and kept asking when I was due. ‘So I went to see my GP, who was convinced at first I was pregnant. An ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac that develops on a woman's ovary. They are very common and do not usually cause any symptoms. In most cases, they are harmless and usually disappear without the need for treatment. However, if the cyst is large or causing symptoms, it may need to be surgically removed. An ovarian cyst will usually only cause symptoms if it ruptures, is very large, or if it blocks the blood supply to the ovaries. In this case, symptoms can include pelvic pain, urinating frequently, a change to menstruation, bloating and tiredness. Source: NHS Choices . ‘But when a pregnancy test proved negative I knew there was something more sinister lurking. ‘I was referred to hospital where I had a biopsy, a CT scan and an ultra sound. ‘Finally a specialist told me that I had a huge ovarian cyst, which from the scan they could see was filled with fluid. ‘They told me if I didn't have it removed I could die.’ Devastated, Mrs Fulton was forced to undergo a full hysterectomy at Glasgow's Royal Infirmary where medics drained more than 32 litres of fluid from her stomach. She said: ‘At the hospital, I had to have my operation in the maternity unit. ‘It was horrible. I was really sad, but I knew I just had to deal with the fact I wouldn't be having children. ‘I knew what was involved in the operation, but I just wanted it gone.’ Mrs Fulton shed more than 5st overnight after the growth was successfully removed. She said: ‘The doctors said it was too risky to remove it whole so it had to be drained. ‘Plus, there was a chance it could come back in my other ovary so I finally consented to a full hysterectomy. ‘I went under the knife and said goodbye to having children once and for all. Mrs Fulton (pictured with her husband, Stewart) was devastated to be told she needed a hysterectomy as she was desperate to have children - but she says she is also grateful to be alive . ‘The doctor drained 32 litres of fluid and removed the lump. ‘Waking up from the op, I felt much better and the following day weighed myself. ‘At that point I'd been 19st and after having the lump removed I was now down to 14st. ‘It was unbelievable I'd been carrying around all that weight. ‘I've now accepted that children are not on the cards for me. Mrs Fulton lost 5st in weight during the operation to remove her cyst and have fluid drained from her abdomen . ‘But things could have been so much worse. I'm lucky to be alive.’ An ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac that develops on a woman's ovary. They are very common and do not usually cause any symptoms. In most cases, they are harmless and usually disappear without the need for treatment. However, if the cyst is large or causing symptoms, it may need to be surgically removed. An ovarian cyst will usually only cause symptoms if it ruptures, is very large, or if it blocks the blood supply to the ovaries.","Lorna Fulton, 44, decided to diet after struggling to conceive .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A teenager was late for her own 18th birthday party after a trainee hairdresser spent six hours giving her a 'terrible' and 'lopsided' style. Paige Kearns from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, paid £85 for a shampoo and a blonde dip dye to look her best for the 1960s themed party. Unbeknown to her, the job was given to a trainee stylist. Having arrived at Decisions salon in Basford just after 3pm, she finally left six hours later - with what she describes as 'lopsided' dyed hair. The waitress eventually arrived at her party at 9.30pm - over two-and-a-half hours late. By the time she arrived, her relatives from Wales were leaving to go home. Paige Kearns, pictured on her 18th birthday, right, arrived late to her own party because a trainee hairstylist took six hours to give her a 'lopsided' dip dye, left . The teen says because of the disastrous trip to the hairdressers she 'didn't enjoy her party at all' - which took place on March 15, cost £600 and had taken months to organise. Miss Kearns says the style . has gained her a lot of unwanted attention - with people mocking her . hair in the street. She says she has tried to get a full refund from the salon - who, she claims, have only offered her £40. Now, she is pursuing legal action after the salon 'refused to take any blame' for the style. She said: 'I couldn't believe what they had done - people were laughing at me in the street. 'I was left looking like an Afghan hound dog, it was so humiliating. Your 18th birthday is supposed to be special but it turned into a nightmare for me. 'I thought the hair cut was going to be done by 6pm but I was concerned when the hairdresser asked how to mix the colours. 'It looked like she was just mixing . some paint but I was too shy and scared to say anything - I had no idea . she wasn't qualified to do it. 'I . am known for my long hair and now it is ruined. The colour has gone all . orange and the dip dye is much higher than I wanted and not even . straight. The waitress posted this picture of the style on Facebook shortly after her birthday on March 15. She says she has been mocked in the street for the dip dye which 'makes her look like an Afghan hound' The teen is now taking the salon to court, saying they only offered her a £40 refund and 'refused to take any of the blame' for the style . 'I will have to have about five inches cut off and that will be the shortest I have ever had it. 'I have taken a lot of photos because we are taking the salon to court because they have only agreed to give £40 back. 'The salon manager is refusing to take any blame so it is going all the way to court now.' At the time, the teen took to Facebook to complain about her hairstyle, posting: 'Wow! thank you Decisions hairdressing for producing this three gradient hair colour! 'Putting a level 1 trainee on my hair and I really enjoyed sitting there for 6 hours to miss my own 18th birthday party that cost £600! 'Well done ladies! you really know . about customer service! especially missing the cut, and not even . shampooing my hair! amazing result. Lets put a level 1 on wedding hair! that sounds like an amazing idea doesn’t it!' In . another angry post she added: 'Majorly gutted the hairdressers pretty . much ruined my evening of being 2 hours late to my 18th, nevertheless . was an amazing night thank you to everyone who came and got me drinks, . cards and presents and to my dad who paid for it all, especially my . beatles cake!' Many of Miss Kearns' friends took to Facebook in support. Leanne . Boden - who paid for the teen's hairdo said: 'The . hairdresser said it was nice before we left, she even took herself a tip . and took £90 of my pre-paid money instead of £85... do u think i have . bn robbed?' The salon in Basford, Stoke-on-Trent. Salon manager Candice Lindsay says the stylist behind the look has apologised and the family have been offered a partial refund . 'I . paid £18 for mine aswell, 6 hours later it had all fallen down so i did . it myself but i don’t mind, they had created such a homely atmosphere, . they had even placed a couple of their hyperactive children in the salon . to run around moaning n messing with everything including the foils in . paige’s hair... i felt right at home. 'She . was just learning her level two, but was totally unsupervised, she . asked for help several times but was refused it as she “had to do it . some time.""' The stylist behind the 'terrible' cut, Sarah-Jane Mascia, has said she is 'upset' the teen didn't like her hair and that she wasn't qualified to do the style . Olivia . Edge said: 'They shouldn’t have put a level 1 on your hair not even . meant to do anything on level one other than the basic hairdressing . stuff. 'Cutting and . colouring is level 2 this is absolutely disgusting that a professional . hairdressers would even do this to someones hair. If this was me id be . demanding every little bit off my money back. Vikki Loraso said: 'Go back and demand your money back that is appalling paige!' Amy . Statham said: 'God I did a better job doing this myself! Make sure they . pay paige! Disgusting. Luckily on the picture I saw of you you still . looked lovely.' Ritta Baker said: 'Oh dear. Wouldn’t have had that prob if u came to my salon xxx.' The stylist behind the 'terrible' cut was Sarah-Jane Mascia, 29, who responded to the criticism by saying: 'I’m studying for my level two qualification and this was level three work. It’s almost like running before you can walk. 'I was upset because I did my best and I know it wasn’t good enough but someone else should have taken over. 'When I looked at the hair I thought the colour was fine. It was the dip dye that looked bad because it had been rushed. I feel let down and everyone at college knows it was me who did the girl’s hair.' Salon manager Candice Lindsay, 27, said: 'I was not in the salon at the time. The junior stylist was very upset after the family complained as she knew she had made a mistake and she apologised. I offered the family a partial refund, which they refused.'","Paige Kearns booked shampoo and blonde dip dye for 18th birthday party .

Miss Holman is now suing the holiday . company Celebrity Cruises, claiming her dance partner was not . ‘seaworthy’ and she received inadequate medical care for her injury.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Lewis Hamilton feels his level of maturity will stand him in good stead for a potential tilt this year at a second Formula One world title. Off the back of strong form in pre-season testing as Mercedes racked up the most kilometres and Hamilton posted the second quickest time, both he and they start as favourites to win the championship. It is a tag, however, that does not sit too well with Hamilton nor Mercedes Motorsport boss Toto Wolff bearing in mind a wheel has not yet turned in anger at a grand prix. Growing up: Lewis Hamilton claims his increased maturity will put him in good stead this season . Circus: Hamilton signs autographs for fans in Melbourne ahead of the Australian Grand Prix this weekend . Side by side: Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg walk on St Kilda in Melbourne . Ready? Hamilton was greeted by a mob of photographers and fans . Only come qualifying for this weekend's Australian Grand Prix will the teams disover where they truly stand in the pecking order as F1's new era, after a raft of regulation changes, begins in earnest. And only then will Hamilton learn if he really is in with a chance of becoming a double world champion after claiming his maiden crown in 2008. The 29-year-old said: 'Everything happens for a reason, and from the ups and downs, the different experiences I've had, I've learned a lot. 'I've had bumps along the way, but I always feel like I've bounced back from them. It's not how you fall, it's how you get back up. 'So through all those experiences, you just brush the dirt off your shoulder and you keep going. 'I'm still enjoying my life, and my famly and I are in a position we never thought we'd be, coming from a one-bedroom flat in Stevenage. 'So we're embracing the opportunity, I'm embracing it. I feel very fortunate to be here, amongst these drivers, driving for Mercedes. It's just a dream. 'I'm 29 now. It feels like a long, long time since I started - I'm starting to get with the older guys - and I feel like I'm maturing.

Hamilton can understand why F1 observers are hailing Mercedes as successors to Red Bull's crown given what unfolded in testing, and why they have been labelled as favourites. But he added: 'Everyone is talking us up and predicting the future, but we really can't say what's going to happen this weekend. 'We know we're strong, we've left no stone unturned, we've done absolutely everything we could possibly do. 'We're hoping we'll be at the front, which is our goal, but we can't say it's going to be the case. 'So coming here, saying this is going to be the best chance I have over the years, I don't know, I haven't even got in the car and raced yet. 'I had a good year in 2012 which was a strong year, and I probably had an opportunity in 2010 which I didn't optimise on, so I've had some chances in the past. 'It is a long, long year, and a long time since I won the world championship. It feels like a long time ago. 'But I'm still here and a lot more motivated from when I was before, more focused than ever before. 'So if the package is there then we will do the job, and there's no reason why we can't fight at the front again.' Centre stage: Sebastian Vettel has reminded everyone who the current world champion is . No 1: Vettel believes those who write him and Red Bull off are acting rashly . Meanwhile, reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel has warned his critics to write off at their peril his chances of him becoming only the second driver in Formula One history to win five successive world titles. Following a wretched pre-season of testing in which the new Red Bull often ground to a halt, the odds are on Vettel failing to even cross the line in Sunday's season-opening Australian Grand Prix, never mind stretching his winning streak to 10 races after taking the chequered flag in the final nine of last year. The Milton Keynes-based team encountered a raft of problems with the RB10 - with Vettel continuing his trend of providing his car with a girl's name and this year calling it Suzie - that has placed them firrnly on the back foot going into the race around Melbourne's Albert Park. It has been suggested the car appears quick enough, and if Red Bull can get on top of their reliability issues then Vettel could again be in the hunt for another crown. Dismissing a suggestion that a fifth consecutive championship was not on the cards, Vettel said: 'That's unfair to say. 'Our season testing, our preparation hasn't been ideal, and we're not in the best position for this race. 'But it's a different story for the championship because there is a long way to go. Bumpy road ahead: Vettel was relaxed during the preview session on Thursday in Melbourne . New look: Daniel Ricciardo (right) replaces Mark Webber as Vettel's team-mate at Red Bull . Pals: But at times Vettel's relationship with Webber was strained . 'Two years ago I remember being on the grid (on pole) and (Fernando) Alonso was 1.5 seconds behind me, but he came very close to beating me for the title at the very last race. 'So it shows anything can happen. That's why this race is important as any other, and there are a lot of races to go. 'Of course, we know we're not in the best shape yet and there are a lot of things we need to solve, but unfortunately you can't solve them all overnight. We'd love to, but we can't. 'We have to go step by step, be as precise as we can, trying to give the best feedback possible to the engineers.' The past few weeks have arguably been some of the toughest for the 26-year-old since he arrived at Red Bull, prompting the question as to how he will react. History boy: Vettel wants to win his fifth consecutive world championship this season . Close rival? Hamilton will hope to muster a greater challenge to the title than last season . Naturally, Vettel has every intention of continuing to give his all, even when the chips might be down. 'At this stage it's difficult for all of us to know what to expect as to how the racing will look, how it will feel inside the car, how many cars will cross the line,' added Vettel. 'We had a lot of problems during the test, as did others, so it's difficult to have any sort of expectations. 'But I'm not going out to simply make it round, rather to the push to the maximum, to do the best I can, and then we'll see where we are and how far we get. 'The target is to finish, and to be in the best possible position. 'As to mindset, it's fairly straightforward for the rest of the year - we're a strong team, we have a lot of good people on board, we've good resources, so we should progress as the season moves on.'","Lewis Hamilton determined to win second world title, first with Mercedes .

"By . Martin Robinson . Thief: Carol Payne, 31, stole £11,500 from the private school's minibus fund and has now told police she took cash from a church . A mother who stole £11,500 from a private school's minibus fund to pay her child's tuition fees has also admitted to taking cash from a local church, a court heard today. Carol Payne used her role as treasurer of the parent-teacher association at Highclare School in Birmingham to plunder cash from the group's bank account. The 31-year-old - who was chosen for the PTA role because she has a background in accountancy - then used the money to pay for her child's fees at the school. Payne admitted stealing £11,532 from the private school when she appeared at Birmingham Magistrates Court in February this year. But her sentencing was adjourned at Birmingham Crown Court today after it emerged she had been arrested on suspicion of stealing from a church in Saltley in the city. Defending Payne, Liz De'Oliveira, said the mother had given a 'full and frank admission' to police on March 4 but had not yet been charged with the offence. The court heard the treasurer had stolen around £13,000 from the church and was due to speak to officers again next month. Miss De'Oliveira said: 'She is facing similar matters which are under investigation regarding Saltley Church. 'She has already been interviewed on the 4th of this month and has made full and frank admissions. 'My understanding is it's around £13,000. In my respectful submissions it would be sensible to have all matters before the court together. 'She has managed to get some compensation together.

Revelations: It also emerged in court today that she has admitted taking £13,000 from this church in Saltley, Birmingham . Recorder Patrick Upward QC adjourned the case and bailed Payne, ordering her to return to court for sentencing for both matters on April 24. He told her: 'This is a very serious matter for which a term of imprisonment is likely.' At an earlier hearing at Birmingham Magistrates Court, Payne pleaded guilty to stealing £11,532 from Highclare School's PTA between September 19, 2012 and October 13, 2012.","Carol Payne used role to take cash from Highclare School in Birmingham .

In less than five years we could be live streaming images from Mars straight into our homes under plans to install a communications satellite on the Red Planet. This would mean millions of eagle-eyed space enthusiasts could scour the live images for signs of alien life, or track changes in the weather, according to Bas Lansdrop, found of the Mars One project. The satellite is part of the wider Mars One mission set to launch in January 2018 with a view to establishing a permanent human settlement on the planet within a decade. Scroll down for video . In less than five years we could be live streaming images from Mars straight into our homes under plans to install a communications satellite, artist illustration pictured, on the Red Planet. The satellite is part of the wider Mars One mission set to launch in January 2018 . The Mars One project needs to raise $400,000 (£245,000) by 25 January to fund its plans. Once enough funding has been raised, the Dutch firm plans to launch a supply mission to land on Mars as . soon as October 2016. A ‘settlement rover’ will then land in 2018. The landing systems will be tested eight times before they are . used to transport humans - a move that Mars One said will make the trips . ‘much safer than moon missions’. The group said it aims to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade. Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days. The £4bn project, founded in 2010 by . engineer Bas Lansdorp, is set to recoup its costs by selling the . broadcasting rights to the mission - by comparison, Nasa's rover Curiosity cost £1.8 billion. The satellite will be built by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) - the company which was announced as one of the official partners of the plans just last week. It will provide a 'high bandwidth communications system in a Mars synchronous orbit' and will be used to relay data and a live video feed from the lander on the surface of Mars back to Earth. Mars One is said to have paid SSTL $60,000 (£36,00) to design what will be the first 'geostationary' satellite on the planet. The Mars lander will then be built by Lockheed Martin. This lander design will be based on the successful Mars lander used in the 2007 NASA Phoenix mission, which was also built and tested by Maryland-based firm. Speaking at a news conference last week, Mars One CEO Lansdorp said: 'Anyone with internet access will be able to see what the . weather's like on Mars.' The . robotic mission to the Red Planet will launch in January 2018 - two . years later than initially planned. This unmanned mission is designed to explore and collect information about the planet with a view to launching a manned mission and setting up a Mars colony. Among those to make the first cut were 297 applicants from America. Hopefuls will be shortlisted into a final group of 40 before training begins. The robotic mission to the Red Planet will launch in January 2018 with plans to send a colony of humans to Mars by 2023. This illustration shows what the settlement would look like . The satellite, artist impression pictured, will provide a 'high bandwidth communications system' to send data and live video back to Earth . The Dutch non-profit company has already gathered . 200,000 volunteers for this colony, and to help fund the project, Mars One launched an IndieGoGo . crowd-funding campaign. The project raised $10,000 (£6,121) in the first hour and . is currently at $78,000 (£47,600). The project is asking for a total of $400,000 (£245,000) and needs to raise this by 25 January.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The beauty of the Great Barrier Reef could soon be smothered in sediment after Australian authorities approved plans to dredge the site. A number of local firms from Queensland and surrounding areas want to use the nearby Abbot Point port to export coal, and the dredging is necessary to allow ships to enter the port. The plans have been approved by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), yet scientists are urging the authorities not to go through with them because the sediment could end up poisoning the fragile coral. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has approved the plans put forward by local companies who want to use the nearby Abbot Point port to export coal. The dredging is needed to let ships enter the port. Scientists have claimed the sediment could poison wildlife and coral, pictured . The Great Barrier Reef covers 1,429 miles and is so large it can be seen from outer space. Marine . creatures include 600 types of soft and hard corals, more than 100 . species of jellyfish, 3000 varieties of molluscs, 500 species of worms, . 1625 types of fish, 133 varieties of sharks and rays, and more than 30 . species of whales and dolphins. It extends south from the northern tip of Queensland in north-eastern Australia to just north of Bundaberg. The reef is an at risk World Heritage listed site that UNESCO believes could become an 'in danger' later this year. In a statement, the GBRMPA said: 'After rigorous assessment, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has approved an application by North Queensland Bulk Ports Corporation to dispose of dredge spoil at a deepwater location offshore of Abbot Point, subject to strict environmental conditions. 'It’s important to note the seafloor of the approved disposal area consists of sand, silt and clay and does not contain coral reefs or seagrass beds.'

Scientists are investigating an area north of the port where the sediment could be dumped instead . The reef, pictured, is an at risk World Heritage listed site that UNESCO believes could become an 'in danger' site later this year . The approved disposal site is located approximately 15 miles east-north-east of the port, while the investigation zone is located 12 to 18 miles from the area being dredged. At the start of January, 233 scientists signed a petition urging GBRMPA to reject the proposals. Greenpeach Reef campaigner Louise Matthiesson slammed the decision as a 'disgrace'. 'The government’s priority should be to protect a reef which took millions of years to form, not take active steps to damage it,' said Matthiesson. 'Marine scientists have rung warning bells of the consequences of dredging and dumping on the reef. 'This makes today’s development an international embarrassment for the Queensland and federal governments.' She warned the dumping is 'one more body blow for the reef' and claimed the plans threaten marine life, its World Heritage status and ultimately Australia's tourism and fishing industries. The dredging is due to take place in 2015 between March and June.","Dredged sediment could soon be dumped in the Great Barrier Reef .

"A neighbour of Oscar Pistorius testified at his murder trial  that she heard gunshots, screaming and then a second set of gun shots on the night that the double-amputee runner fatally shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. The testimony by Anette Stipp matched some of the testimony by other witnesses who have said they also heard a woman screaming around the time that Pistorius killed Steenkamp before dawn on Feb. 14, 2013. The defence has countered that the neighbours were actually hearing Pistorius screaming in a high-pitched voice after he shot Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model.

Oscar Pistorius makes a call on his mobile phone before proceedings get under way . Pistorius has said he shot his girlfriend by mistake through a locked toilet door, thinking that she was an intruder in his home. Under questioning from chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel, Stipp said she heard gunshots while lying awake around 3 a.m. on the night of the shooting, and then heard the 'terrified, terrified' screams of a woman. 'The screaming at that stage just continued,' said Stipp, who recalled looking out from a balcony at two houses with lights on in the gated estate where her family and Pistorius lived. She said she told her husband Johan, who . previously testified, that the screaming sounded as though a 'family . murder' had taken place. Entrance: Olympic and Paralympic track star Pistorius arrives ahead of his trial . On his way in: Pistorius, left, accompanied by relatives arrives at the high court in Pretoria .

'There was definitely a female screaming for quite a period,' Anette Stipp said. 'You could definitely hear two different voices.' She said she then heard a second set of shots, and the screaming stopped. Defence lawyer Barry Roux has said that after Pistorius fired into the door that he battered the door with a cricket bat to try to get to Steenkamp after realising she was inside the toilet cubicle.

The defence will then present its case. Judicial officials say the trial will continue until May 16, with a recess in April. Together: Reeva Steenkamp pictured with Pistorius. The prosecution allege he intentionally killed her after an argument . Scene: Pistorius shot Miss Steenkamp through the bathroom door at his home (above) in Pretoria in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year . Prosecutors at Oscar Pistorius' murder trial have presented a 'golden thread' of evidence suggesting Reeva Steenkamp screamed before she died, leaving the double-amputee athlete with 'serious questions' to answer and his defense likely hinging on his own testimony, a legal expert in South Africa said. Three neighbours say they heard a woman scream before and during the deadly gunshots coming from Pistorius' home in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year.The pathologist who performed the autopsy on Steenkamp's body said it would have been 'abnormal' for her not to scream from some of her injuries. A police ballistics expert concluded that the first shot Pistorius fired through a toilet door hit Steenkamp in the hip and caused her to collapse, but didn't immediately kill her. The second shot missed. From the policeman's testimony, Steenkamp likely had time to yell out before she was hit by two more shots as she covered her head with her arms in a desperate attempt to protect herself. 'Suddenly what we have is Oscar Pistorius firing at Reeva Steenkamp while her hands are covering her head while she's screaming in the toilet, and that's murder,' said Marius du Toit, a defense lawyer and former state prosecutor who says he has worked on at least 100 murder cases. Du Toit, who is following the trial but not involved, said the prosecution has 'definitely' made a case for murder against the Olympic runner for the fatal shooting of Steenkamp, and Pistorius' defense must now respond. Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel has so far presented a specific line of evidence compellingly, du Toit said. Using the accounts of neighbors and backing them up with the expert opinion of pathologist Gert Saayman and police ballistics investigator Capt. Christiaan Mangena, Nel may have shown to the court that it was 'reasonable' that Steenkamp screamed during the four shots fired at her, du Toit said. 'There's definitely a golden thread here,' du Toit told The Associated Press in a telephone interview, using a courtroom term that refers to the prosecution's duty to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 'A golden thread of someone who was screaming and who was shot. The objective facts, which are the injuries she sustained, coupled with the expert opinion, tied with your circumstantial evidence presented by witnesses. And if that ties up with one another then Oscar has got a major problem.'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Twitter might be best known as the place to go for day-to-day updates about people’s lives and celebrity selfies, but it could also be used as a health tool, researchers claim. Geography experts have discovered that posts on the social network predicted flu outbreaks in different parts of the U.S. They believe Twitter could help medical professionals learn where and when severe flu outbreaks are occurring in real time so they can prepare for busy periods, which typically occur during the winter months. Whenever people tweeted the keywords 'flu' or 'influenza,' the computer programme recorded characteristics about the tweets, including the username and location of the people who sent them . The researchers, led by San Diego State University geography professor Ming-Hsiang Tsou, examined tweets that originated from a 17 mile radius of 11 different U.S. cities between June and December 2012. Whenever people tweeted the keywords ‘flu’ or ‘influenza,’ a computer programme recorded characteristics about the tweets, including the username and location of the people who sent them as well as whether they were original tweets or retweets and whether they linked to a website. From June 2012 to the beginning of December, the algorithm recorded 161,821 tweets containing the word ‘flu’ and 6,174 containing ‘influenza’. The researchers compared the location data of those tweets to data on the flu virus rates recorded in the relevant cities and counties. They discovered that of the 11 cities where tweets were examined, there was a ‘significant’ correlation between tweets about flu and the rates of flu-like illnesses in nine of the cities. Geography experts believe Twitter could help medical professionals learn where and when severe flu outbreaks are occurring in real time so they can prepare for busy periods, which typically occur during the winter months . Twitter also seemed to be able to predict outbreaks in five of the cities: San Diego, Denver, Jacksonville, Fort Worth and Seattle, as the tweets recorded instances of illness before they were officially documented and reported by cities and counties. ‘Traditional procedures take at least two weeks to detect an outbreak. With our method, we're detecting daily,’ he said. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention defines flu season as the period from October through May, usually peaking around February, but the unpredictability of when and where outbreaks may occur makes it difficult for hospitals and regional health centres to prepare. Professor Tsou believes his technique could allow officials to more quickly and efficiently direct resources to outbreak zones and better contain the spread of the disease. A busy hospital waiting room is pictured . There is about a two week lag in the time it takes for hospitals to notice a sharp rise in flu patients and the U.S. centre issuing a warning. The researchers found original tweets and . tweets without website links proved more predictive than retweets or . those that did include links, possibly because original tweets are more . likely to reflect individuals posting about their own symptoms. Professor Tsou believes his technique, which is detailed in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, could allow officials to more quickly and efficiently direct resources to outbreak zones and better contain the spread of the disease. ‘There is the potential to use social media to really improve the way we monitor the flu and other public health concerns,’ he said. Professor Tsou is not on his own in thinking social media could be used as a powerful predictive medical tool. In 2011, scientists from Pennsylvania State University used Twitter to track attitudes towards the flu vaccination and labelled them as being positive, neutral or negative. Another study found 46 per cent of office workers and 56 per cent of senior business people blame employees who 'soldier on' for spreading workplace germs . U.S. mobile conferencing company Citrix has also built a microsite to track tweets about flu to examine how it affects workplaces. It said ‘lurgy’ is the highest flu-related hashtag on Twitter, according to a UK study it commissioned by YouGov and that ‘office martyrs’ are the top cause of widespread illness in offices. The survey found 46 per cent of office workers and 56 per cent of senior business people blame employees who ‘soldier on’ for spreading workplace germs. Around a quarter of UK office works said their colleagues do not take time off when they are ill as they worry about their workload, while just over half of workers agree the office would be more productive if ill colleagues stayed at home.","Geography experts believe Twitter could help medical professionals learn where and when severe flu outbreaks are occurring in real time .

"By . Sean Poulter . The commercial production of eggs for fast growing GM salmon has been given approval in a crucial step to bringing ‘Frankenfish’ to the world’s kitchens. The salmon have been genetically modified to include genes from the eel-like Ocean pout and Chinook salmon, which means they grow more quickly than their wild or farmed equivalent. The US authorities are in the final stages of an approval process to allow the first genetically modified animals for human consumption. The GM salmon have been genetically modified to include genes from the eel-like Ocean pout and Chinook salmon (pictured), which means they grow more quickly than their wild or farmed equivalent . While salmon are the first GM fish soon to be approved, plans are also in place to create fast-growing trout and tilapia. Biotech companies believe there are huge riches to be had from tapping into the fast growing fish farming industry, which is said to be worth $100 billion a year. Typically the GM salmon grow to be around 24 inches long and a market weight of 3kg in 18 months rather than three years for farmed Atlantic salmon. Some of the salmon, which have been developed by the company AquaBounty, have been grown to reach 11lb (5kg). The addition of genes from the ocean pout and the chinook salmon triggers the release of growth hormone and encourages them to eat and grow all year round, rather than just the spring and summer. The net effect is that fish farming companies can harvest the fish much more often, so boosting production and profits. AquaBounty . Technologies Inc is based in Canada, however it is listed on the London . Stock Market where it is keen to enlist investors. Today, . the company said it was received clearance from the Government of . Canada to produce eggs on a commercial scale at its facility in Prince . Edward Island, Canada. Critics . fear the GM salmon will escape into the wild. It is suggested they . might interbreed with wild fish or effectively kill off wild populations . because they will consume all the available food. Today, AquaBounty said it has received clearance from the Government of Canada to produce eggs on a commercial scale at its facility in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Salmon eggs at a fish hatchery are pictured . However, AquaBounty insists there are a number of key safeguards that will stop this from happening. Initially at least, the eggs will be shipped to a land-locked fish farm in western Panama, where they will be grown to market size in vast metal tanks, away from rivers and the sea. The salmon would be frozen and shipped to the U.S. and around the world. In future, fish farm tanks would be established across the globe to meet growing demand for what is considered a healthy fish variety. All the GM salmon are designed to be female and sterile, which should, in theory, prevent any risk of interbreeding. The approval for commercial production of the GM salmon eggs was granted following a risk assessment conducted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada, which involved independent scientists and the government agency, Environment Canada. This study concluded AquaBounty’s . salmon ‘is not harmful to the environment or human health when produced . in contained facilities’. A . company spokesman said: ‘While AquaBounty’s eggs and fish will not be . available for sale until they are approved by the relevant national . regulatory bodies, this is a significant milestone towards commercial . production.’ Campaigning . groups in the UK and overseas have raised significant questions about . the ethics and safety of producing GM fish for human consumption. They . claim the fish farm in Panama has been built without all the necessary . inspections and permits to ensure the site is secure and safe. Biotech companies believe there are huge riches to be had from tapping into the fast growing fish farming industry, which is said to be worth $100 billion a year . Dr Helen Wallace of GeneWatch UK said: ‘It is shocking that commercial production of GM salmon could be authorised in future in facilities which fail to meet environmental standards.’ GeneWatch claims the EU food watchdog, the European Food Safety Authority, has not put in sufficient safeguards to ensure GM fish cannot come in to member states without proper checks on their safety. It is also a grey area as to whether GM fish imported from Panama or other parts of the world would have to be labelled to ensure consumers know what they are eating. British consumers have made clear in surveys that labelling is a minimum requirement, however the record of the British government has been to oppose putting such information on packs. The Canadian Biotechnology Action Network condemned the approval for commercial production of GM salmon eggs. Spokesman Lucy Sharratt said: ‘We are extremely disappointed and alarmed that our government has approved the production of GM fish eggs. GM salmon egg production in Canada . endangers the future of wild Atlantic salmon around the world. ‘It’s simply crazy that the world’s first GM fish eggs are now going to be coming from Canada.’ ‘It’s unacceptable that this incredibly important decision was made in total secrecy and without any public consultation.’ The GM fish egg production is opposed by the Prince Edward Island group called Islanders Say No to Frankenfish. Spokesman, Leo Broderick, said: ‘We’re devastated that Prince Edward Island is now officially the home of the Frankenfish. We don’t want our Island to be the source of this dangerous living pollution.’","The salmon have been genetically modified to include genes from Chinook salmon, which means they grow faster than their wild or farmed equivalent .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The destruction caused by deforestation, wildfires and storms on our planet have been revealed in unprecedented detail. High-resolution maps released by Google show how global forests experienced an overall loss of 1.5 million sq km during 2000-2012. For comparison, that’s a loss of forested land equal in size to the entire state of Alaska. Scroll down for video and animations... Using Landsat imagery and cloud computing, researchers mapped forest cover worldwide as well as forest loss and gain. Over 12 years, 888,000 square miles (2.3 million square kilometers) of forest were lost, and 309,000 square miles (800,000 square kilometers) regrew . The maps, created by a team involving Nasa, Google and the University of Maryland researchers, used images from the Landsat satellite. Each pixel in a Landsat image showing an area about the size of a baseball diamond, providing enough data to zoom in on a local region. Before this, country-to-country comparisons of forestry data were not possible at this level of accuracy. ‘When you put together datasets that employ different methods and definitions, it's hard to synthesise,’ said Matthew Hansen at the University of Maryland. The forest cover maps also capture natural disturbances such as this 2011 tornado path in Alabama. In this map, the colours represent forest loss by year, with yellows representing loss closer to 2000 and reds representing later forest loss, up to 2012 . The Brazilian government yesterday revealed that deforestation in the Amazon increased by nearly a third over the past year. Satellite . data for the 12 months through the end of July showed that . deforestation in the area climbed by 28 per cent compared with a year . earlier. The total land cleared during the period amounted to 2,256 . square miles (5,843 square km)- an area almost the size of Delaware. The . figure fulfilled predictions by scientists and environmentalists, based . on figures compiled through the year, that destruction was on the rise . again. ‘You can't argue . with numbers,’ said Marcio Astrini, coordinator for the Amazon campaign . at the Brazilian chapter of Greenpeace, the environmentalist group. ‘This is not alarmist - it's a real and measured inversion of what had been a positive trend.’ ‘With Landsat, as a polar-orbiting instrument that takes the same quality pictures everywhere, we can apply the same algorithm to forests in the Amazon, in the Congo, in Indonesia, and so on. Professor Hansen looked at 143 billion pixels in 654,000 Landsat images to compile maps of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2012. During that period, 888,000 square miles (2.3 million square kilometers) of forest were lost, and 309,000 square miles (800,000 square kilometers) regrew. The team found the deforestation rate in most countries increased. Indonesia's deforestation rate doubled in the study period, from approximately 3,900 square miles (10,000 square kilometers) per year in 2000-2003 to more than 7,700 square miles (20,000 square kilometers) in 2011-2012. ‘This is the first time  somebody has been able to do a wall-to-wall, global Landsat analysis of all the world's forests - where they're being cleared, where they're regrowing, and where they're subject to natural disturbances,’ said Jeff Masek, Landsat project scientist at the Goddard Space Flight Center. A view of deforestation in the UK. Red shows forest loss in 2000-2012, blue shows forest gain in the same period, and pink shows both a loss and a gain in the area . The maps also illustrate the impact of politics on land cover. For instance, on the island of Borneo, the maps clearly show the border between Malaysia and Indonesia. Malaysia's heavy logging along forest roads is visible right up to the Indonesian border, where forests were still largely intact as of 2012. In Côte d'Ivoire, a civil war in 2002 corresponded with intense deforestation of several previously protected nature reserves. A different pattern of change appears in the southeastern U.S., where landowners harvest trees for timber and quickly plant their replacements' ‘Of this eco-region in the southeast, 30 per cent of the forest land was regrown or lost during this period,’ Professor Hansen said. Civil unrest in Côte d'Ivoire was associated with widespread deforestation in national parks, including Marahoué National Park. Other protected areas, such as Tai National Park, remained intact . ‘It's incredibly intensive. Trees are really treated like a crop in this region.’ In Alabama, Landsat detected miles-long streaks of destroyed forest. When the researchers examined the year-by-year record, they found the damage occurred in 2011 after a violent tornado season. Brazil cut its deforestation rate from approximately 15,400 square miles (40,000 square kilometers) per year to approximately 7,700 square miles (20,000 square kilometers) per year. ‘That's the result of a concerted policy effort to reduce deforestation, and it sets a standard for the rest of the world,’ Professor Hansen said. However,  the Brazilian government yesterday revealed that deforestation in the Amazon increased by nearly a third over the past year. The border between Malaysia and Indonesia on the island of Borneo stands out in the Landsat-based map of forest disturbance. Red pixels represent forest loss between 2000 and 2012 . Satellite data for the 12 months through the end of July showed that deforestation in the area climbed by 28 per cent compared with a year earlier. Although scattered, the total land cleared during the period amounted to 2,256 square miles (5,843 square km)- an area almost the size of the U.S. state of Delaware.

"By . Anna Edwards . Claire Perry urged the Church to consider pulling its money out of Google . A Government aide has urged investors to sell their Google shares to try and pressure the internet giant into blocking child abuse images. Conservative MP Claire Perry, an adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron on preventing the sexualisation and commercialisation of childhood, urged the Church of England to cut ties with the search engine that they back. Ms Perry told the Church to pull its money out of Google in a bid to force the company to take a stronger line over pornographic and abusive images widely available through its engine. She told The Daily Telegraph: 'It is quite clear that many companies, in particular British internet service providers, are finally now taking a really responsible approach to this. They are seeing that we want a level of social responsibility. 'There are others out there who have not got that attitude. The Prime Minister was saying Google have a responsibility, they are effectively helping people for which there can be no case made. 'They (the Church of England and other investors) have a role to play, they have questions to ask themselves. They are moral leaders. 'If they are going to opine on things then putting your money where your mouth is is an incredibly powerful tool.' Google is among the many companies backed by the Church's three bodies - and as a 'moral leader' the Church should put its money where its mouth is, the MP said . Her demands follow the Archbishop of . Canterbury's pledge to to review the Church’s investment strategy, after . ‘very embarrassing’ revelations that it has holdings in firms that . profit from payday lending. The Church of England holds millions . of pounds worth of shares in companies in everything from oil to . pharmaceuticals and technology as part of an investment portfolio worth . around £7.5 billion, documents show. The Archbishop of Canterbury is to review the Church's investment strategy . Google, Apple, Shell, BP, . GlaxoSmithKline and Vodafone are among the companies backed by the . Church's three bodies that manage and administer investments, according . to documents available on its website. Others include mining firms Rio Tinto and Anglo American, food producer Nestle and British supermarket Tesco. It was also revealed that it may have invested in companies involved in arms dealing and pornography. The Most Reverend Justin Welby said he was irritated and embarrassed to discover that the Church has indirectly invested in payday loan firm Wonga, which earlier this week he vowed to drive out of business. It also emerged that the Church’s ‘ethical’ rules allow it to invest its £5.2billion assets in firms involved in gambling, tobacco and alcohol. Even firms involved in arms dealing, pornography and human cloning are not barred from receiving Church investment. Ecclesiastic financial activity is monitored by the Church's Ethical Investment Advisory Group (EIAG), which makes recommendations on ethical investment policy. The EIAG, in its annual review for 2012/2013 says that these three bodies - the Church of England Pension Board, the Church Commissioners and the CBF Church of England funds - have a 'moral and legal responsibility' to further the interests of their beneficiaries. But it adds: 'While mindful at all times of beneficiaries' need for financial returns, the investing bodies seek to align their investment policies with the ethics of the Church by acting on the recommendations of the EIAG.' Google has come under fire recently after refusing to install automatic filters that would force users to ‘opt in’ to online pornography. However, in June it donated £1 million to the Internet Watch Foundation, a charity that polices images of child abuse and can get them removed. And last month Google, along with BT, TalkTalk and Facebook, pledged an additional £1 million over four years to the foundation. A Google spokesperson said: 'We have a zero tolerance attitude to child sexual abuse imagery. We use our own systems and work with child safety experts to find it, remove and report it. 'We recently donated $5million dollars to groups working to combat this problem and are committed to continuing the dialogue with the Government on these issues.'","MP Claire Perry  urged the Church to pull its money out of Google .

"Cleansing: Mrs Newton-John, pictured last week in Melbourne, Australia, flew in a Catholic priest to carry out an exorcism at her Florida home . Grease star Olivia Newton-John ordered an exorcism at her $5.6million Florida home to expel the spirit of a suicide victim. Mrs Newton-John, 64, flew in a Catholic priest to conduct the ritual after Christopher Pariseleti, a 41-year-old contractor, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the house last month. She is said to have ordered the cleansing ritual to reassure potential buyers that the property is not haunted. The singer, 64, her husband John . Easterling, 61, and two other friends attended the ceremony last week, . where prayers were spoken and holy water sprinkled around rooms in the . house, according to the Sunday Express. The decision to hold the ritual was made after comedian Rosie O'Donnell pulled out of buying the home, for which she had previously offered $5.6million. Despite the star cutting the asking price for the home by $320,000, there are still reportedly no interested parties. An Orlando estate agent said: 'Unfortunately there is a grim notoriety to the house and people are put off by that. Whoever buys the home will always know that someone blew their brains out in there. It is not the nicest housewarming present.' Home: The property, said to be worth $5.6million, is in Jupiter, Florida . Ritual: Olivia Newton-John and John Easterling, pictured, asked a Catholic priest to ritually cleanse their home . It was also reported that Mr Pariseleti, a married father of two, killed himself after he was refused a loan by Mrs Newton-John to keep his business afloat, and chose to do it on the property to disrupt the sale. Tragic: Construction company owner Christopher Pariseleti, 41, killed himself with a shotgun last month . Officers in Jupiter revealed Mr Pariseleti's identity last month after an autopsy, which found he had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The custom home builder was working on Newton-John's $5.6 million mansion, jointly owned by Mrs Newton-John and Mr Easterling,, who were out of town at the time of the shooting. A police statement said: 'This case investigation has been . classified as a suicide and there are no suspicious circumstances . surrounding the death of Mr Pariseleti.' Jupiter . Police spokesman Scott Pascarella said it appeared Mr Pariseleti had . brought the handgun used in the incident to the house himself. 'Based on preliminary information, we believe the gun did not belong to anyone in the house,' Pascarella said. Mr Pariseleti was the owner of Pariseleti Construction Inc. He had reportedly been working on this property for several months. Local residents say he was a well-liked figure. Neighbor Marilyn Barfield told Celebuzz that Mr Pariseleti was popular as he was often working on different properties in the community. 'He's . a longtime contractor of Olivia's. He did the total remodel on the . house,' Mrs Barfield said. 'He was just the nicest person you ever want to . meet. I can't believe it.' 'There was only one other person . working over there at the time that I could see. I thought it could be . the pressure cleaner working on the driveway. I didn't think it was a . gun.'

In the very near future there will be machines that act just like humans, doctors will be able to eradicate cancers using your DNA and the password will finally die a death. That’s according to predictions from tech experts at IBM. The firm’s annual 5 in 5 report, which looks ahead at technology trends has, this year, focused on the development of smarter computers, phones and other machines. It predicts that ‘everything will learn’ from the data we store online, what websites we visit, where we go and how we act - and this information will be used for good, and not just for advertising purposes. Scroll down for videos . In its annual 5 in 5 report, IBM has predicted that in the next five years, 'everything will learn'. For example, rather than having passwords, applications will be able to talk to each other to give and learn who a person is. It can then immediately identify unusual or suspicious behaviour and prevent identity theft . According to the annual IBM 5 in 5 report, in the next five years: . The classroom will learn you - smarter classrooms will use cloud data to learn about students and identify learning disorders immediately . Buying local will beat online -  shops will combine the convenience of online shopping in physical stores and same-day delivery will improve. Doctors will routinely use your DNA to keep you well -  By using advancements in DNA research, doctors will be able to uniquely identify how a certain cancer or disease will affect a person. Treatments and medications will become more tailored and waiting times will drop. A digital guardian will protect you online - Passwords will be replaced by devices that learn who a person is, how they behave and what sites they use. They will grant access automatically to that person, but also be able to identify unusual or suspicious activity automatically. The city will help you live in it - Governments will be able to use data about its residents movements, needs and more to improve cities and towns, including schools and transport routes. The report then breaks down the predictions into five categories and predicts that each of them will happen by 2018. For example, in five years, IBM predicts ‘security is going to become more agile’. Rather than having passwords for different devices, sites and sevices, all of these applications will be able to talk to each other to give a ‘360-degree view of a person’s data and movements.’ This means these devices will just know who someone is, without that person ever having to identify themselves. This so-called ‘digital guardian’ will be trained to focus on a person and learn how they behave to then be able to identify any unusual or suspicious activity; making identity theft a thing of the past. Elsewhere, IBM claims the classroom of the future will be able learn about each student over the course of their education to help them master the skills they need to meet individual goals. It will be powered by a system of sophisticated computers that study data about students stored in the cloud and will be able to immediately identify learning disorders, such as dyslexia, discover if any students are at risk from failing, or even bullying, and will suggest measures to help these students solve these problems. One of the more surprising IBM 5 in 5 predictions is that the high-street will bounce back and beat online shopping. According to the report, ‘buying local will become du jour once again.'

Retailers will be able to combine digital products and services with physical stores meaning shoppers can physically, or virtually touch and try on clothes before ordering them to arrive in minutes. Services including Shutl are already making one-hour delivery a possibility, and IBM expects this to become even more popular. In medical terms, advancements in DNA research will help doctors understand how a tumour, for example, will uniquely affect each patient. Smart analysis will then be able to offer medications or treatments that can best attack that particular type of cancer in that particular individual, while reducing the time it takes to find the right treatment for a patient  ‘from weeks and months to days and minutes’.

The final prediction made by IBM is about smarter cities. The firm believes that in five years governments and councils will be able to understand, in real-time, how billions of events occur within a city or town.

'And yet, we struggle to keep up with this flood of increasingly complex information, let alone make sense of the meaning that is inherent in the massive amounts of data we are acquiring at ever faster rates,' said Dr. Dario Gil, Director, Cognitive Experience Lab, IBM. 'By creating technology that is explicitly designed to learn and enhance our cognition we will usher in a new era of progress for both individuals and for society at large.' IBM believes that these changes will be fuelled by 'a new era in computing’ that will lead to 'breakthroughs that will amplify human abilities, assist us in making good choices, look out for us and help us navigate our world in powerful new ways.'

Tracking people online and showing personalised adverts is already a controversial topic and now Google is set to ruffle feathers further by tracking people in the real world too. According to reports from tech website Digiday, the search giant is testing a program that would follow users around the high street to see which shops they visit. Each time a user enters a store of business, Google would be able check to see if that user looked at adverts for that company online beforehand to check the ad's conversion rate. Google is said to be testing a program that would follow users around the high street, pictured, to see which shops they visit. Each time a user enters a store of business, Google can check to see if that user looked at adverts for that company online to check the ad's conversion rate . Earlier this year Google announced a feature called Estimated Total Conversions, and in particular, Estimated cross-device conversions. As the name suggests, Google plans to use this tool to track conversion rates across devices. For example, if a user shops for jeans on their mobile by clicking on an advert for a particular company, and then buys a product from that company on a desktop browser, Google counts this as a cross-device conversion. To track the customer they have to be signed into their Google account across each of their devices. Recent reports found Google makes around $100 million a day by selling Google Ads to businesses online. It tracks conversion rates online when either a user clicks directly on an advert, or the user visits the website featured in an advert during its browsing session. Google can already access certain information about a user through its own apps, such as the mobile Chrome browser, Google Maps, Gmail and Google+. If users have ‘Location services’ activated and then have one of these apps is open, or running in the background, as they shop on the high street, Google can pinpoint exactly where they are. The location's accuracy is improved if a customer accesses a company's Wi-Fi, for example.

"By . Alex Greig . A Texas real-estate developer is in possession of footage of John F. Kennedy's motorcade from that fateful day in Dallas that he believes supports the theory that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone. Whether or not the footage is genuine isn't yet known, but if it is, it would represent a dramatic development in a story 50 years in the making. Following the 50th anniversary of the death of JFK, Stephen Bowen, who is also a principal in small film production company, decided the time was right to sell the footage, which reportedly depicts a second shooter, to the highest bidder. That fateful day: John F and Jackie Kennedy in the car in which he would be assassinated . According to The Wrap, Bowen acquired the film from a Houston television news producer, who had held onto it secretly for more than 40 years. While no one has yet viewed the footage, it's said to show a second shooter hiding in the bushes along the route the presidential motorcade took on 22 November, 1963. 'You can see a guy in the bushes with a gun,' the source told The Wrap. It also reportedly contains lost and damaged frames from the famous footage made by Abraham Zapruder and sold to Time in 1963. The 50th anniversary of John F Kennedy's death has reignited the debate about the assassination, with many speculating recently that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone, including Oswald's wife Marina Oswald, and John F Kennedy's nephew, Robert F Kennedy Jr. Still raw: Thousands gathered at the exact place and the exact time President John F. Kennedy lost his life on Friday as speculation about his death continues to swirl 50 years on . Not alone: Many, including John Kerry and Robert F Kennedy Jr, have expressed doubt at the Warren Commission's finding that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone . Kennedy Jr recently said that his father, Robert Kennedy thought the Warren commission that found Oswald acted alone was a 'shoddy piece of craftsmanship.' 'The evidence at this point I think is very, very convincing that it was not a lone gunman,' said Kennedy Jr. John Kerry has also spoken about his misgivings on the findings of the Warren commission. 'Regarding possible conspiracies, to this day I have serious doubts that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone,' he said in Parade magazine. Conspiracy: New footage purports to show a second shooter hiding in bushes along the presidential motorcade's route . Bowen is represented by The Gersh Agency, which intends to hold private screenings of the footage for interested parties next week in Los Angeles. If the footage was owned by the Houston producer for more than 40 years, then Bowen must have owned it for a significant portion of the past 10 years. He has decided now is the time to 'bring it to market.'","Texas real-estate developer Stephen Bowen claims to have footage of JFK's assassination .

"By . Sean Poulter . Meat and milk from the offspring of clone farm animals should be allowed on to supermarket shelves without labels, according to EU officials. The proposals, which would keep families in the dark about what they are eating, were outlined today in a move that was condemned by consumer groups. The idea of cloning animals for food may seem bizarre and akin to science fiction, however it is possible that beef and milk from the offspring of clones is already being imported here from the USA and other countries. Milk and meat from offspring of clone animals should be sold without labels, EU officials have said (file picture) Separately, the Daily Mail has revealed attempts to rear clone animal offspring in the UK to produce milk for breakfast tables dating back to 2008. It emerged three years ago that a Scottish farmer had purchased two bulls, which were the sons of a clone, and then bred 92 Holstein milking cows from them. Initially, he planned to sell the milk in the UK, however following a consumer backlash, he decided to destroy more than 40  of the cows and exported around 30 to Portugal. The European consumer body, BEUC, condemned any proposal that does not require the labelling of food from clone offspring . Attempts to breed clones in the past has been associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and malformed organs. There is also a problem of 'gigantism', with new-borns so large they have to be removed by Caesarean section. Some animals, including the original clone Dolly the Sheep, created by the Roslyn Institute in Scotland, suffer the early onset of crippling arthritis. In 2008, the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies expressed doubts that animal cloning for food production can be justified, citing ‘the current level of suffering and health problems’. Research by Britain’s Food Standards Agency(FSA) shows the majority of consumers oppose the idea of cloning for food with concerns both for animal welfare and human health. If cloning is allowed, the research shows that most people want any resulting food, whether from clones or their offspring, to be  labelled. The new proposals from the European Commission would ban the sale of food from clones, however there would be no such controls on food from their sons and daughters. The European consumer body, BEUC, condemned any proposal that does not require the labelling of food from clone offspring. It said: ‘Currently, cloning for food production is not used in the European Union. However, imports - mainly meat - from the United States, Argentina and Brazil can come from clone offspring. The proposals from the European Commission would ban the sale of food from clones but no such controls would be in place on food from their sons and daughters . ‘Without effective labelling, European consumers have no knowledge of what their Argentinian steak or American beef is made of as traceability systems for cloned food do not exist in these countries.’ The BEUC director general, Monique Goyens(correct), said: ‘If Europe is to open the floodgates to meat from the offspring of clones, the least it can do is to allow consumers a choice by labelling such foods. ‘An overwhelming 83per cent of consumers voiced their concerns and have said ‘no’ to steak and milk from clones and their offspring. If consumers are opposed to cloning for food production, why is the debate still open?’","European .

Fishermen, working in partnership with researchers and scientists at the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, tagged the Bonito Tuna while they were working off the coast of Spain near to the Spanish city of San Sebastian in 2006. But they were shocked to find it has been found off the coast of Venezuela, South America, some seven years and 3,958 miles later. Mammoth journey: The tuna swam for seven years to make the huge trip . Tuna: The fish are being studied as part of a program between fishermen, researchers and governments . The tuna had doubled in size from 19.7 inches to 39 inches during the voyage, The Local reports. It had also piled on the pounds going from weighing 5.5lb in 2006 to 48lb when it was recaptured after its trans-Atlantic journey. Experts at the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas say this is a record journey for the species. A red tuna, caught by a fisherman in Massachusetts, US, in 2007, had travelled 3,833 miles. Since 2001, Spanish fishermen have worked with governments, fishing association and researchers to study Atlantic fish. Tuna migrate south annually either to mate or follow food sources. Scientists have been tagging and studying fish for years in an effort to make sure there is enough tuna stocks around the world to meet commercial demand. There are five fishing bodies across the globe, including the  International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas which work to prevent overfishing and preserve different species.","Bonita tuna tagged by Spanish fishermen in 2006 .

"By . Louise Boyle . A mysterious fire which destroyed North America's greatest ancient civilization has led to fascinating discoveries about social tensions, violent tendencies and religious practices within the society. The city of Cahokia, whose secrets lie underneath where St Louis, Missouri now stands, was ruined by a huge blaze around the year 1170 CE. Following the disaster, the Native American city changed dramatically - defense walls were built, buildings fortified and a sun symbol incorporated into designs. The significant changes have led to one nagging historical mystery - just how did the fire start? The illustration is an aerial perspective of Cahokia Mounds circa AD 1150-1200 which was destroyed by a huge blaze . Secrets of the past: Monk's Mound in Colinsville, Illinois is believed to have been built as a place of worship in ancient cultures . An 1887 illustration of Monk's Mound blown a little out of proportion. However the ancient civilizations have long been of interest to history buffs . Cahokia, pictured in this illustration, was originally a vast city encircled by 120 . pyramids, stretches of farmland and wealthy communities. Those who . built the model city were known as the Mound Builders because of the . earthen structures similar to Mayan Temples. The mounds . appear to have had religious significance to the dwellers, with . tombs below and places of worship on top. (Only one remains today called . Monk's Mound near Colinsville, Illinois.) Like the Mayans, the civilization was known to make human sacrifices, including dismembering and  burying people alive. The city appeared in the year 600 around the same time as Mayan culture was booming hundreds of miles to the south. Cahokia flourished over the next few hundred years, growing to a population of around 15,000 people - comparable to Paris or London at that time. What lies beneath: The secrets of the ancient city of Cahokia are buried below where St Louis, Missouri stands today . A museum explains the practices of the ancient culture which reached its peak around 1000CE . However at the height of the city's . boom, a huge fire tore through the center destroying many of the . buildings which were wooden with thatched roofs. In 1250, Cahokia had a population of 15,000 - similar to Paris or London at that time . Civilization was known to make human sacrifices -sometimes burying people alive . According to a study, published this month in the Journal of Field Archaeology, strange new evidence is leading to exciting theories about the fire. At the new dig in east St Louis, archaeologists found luxury items such as clay pots and animal bones used in ceremonies. The homes that were destroyed in the fire - around 100 in all - appeared to have been temporary structures. The scientists now believe that instead of the fire being an accident or being set by an enemy, it was in fact a mass sacrifice. The inhabitants left no written records beyond symbols on pottery, shell, copper, wood and stone. However one clue that led researchers to this theory is that evidence shows that the homes which were burned were not rebuilt. Previous digs in Cahokia showed that if houses burnt down, then dwellers would rebuild on top however in this instance, the ashes were swept into piles and left untouched. Another clue, is that home design changed dramatically in the wake of the fire. In the original city, the rich and . powerful lived in large homes whereas following the blaze all the . structures became more regulated and smaller. Archaeologists believe that it is possible a group of rebels started the fire and took over the city. The use of the sun imagery may have been symbolic of a new religion or political leadership. The . fire was a major event in the city's existence and by 1400, there was . almost no one left. It lost power and never regained its reputation. Tamarois et Caouquias appears on a map of Illinois in 1718 (approximate modern state area highlighted) from Carte de la Louisiane et du Cours du Mississipi by Guillaume de L'Isle .","Cahokia was built around 600CE and stood on the site of St Louis, Missouri .

"By . Anna Edwards . The end of the Syrian chemical weapons crisis and the stronger pound sent wholesale prices tumbling . With soaring energy bills and the cost of living rising, there is finally some good news for British households - petrol prices have tumbled. Drivers are paying the lowest average price for petrol in more than two and a half years, according to a study. The AA Fuel Price Report found the average pump price of petrol fell from 132.16p per litre last month to 130.44p. It had risen to a high of 138.38p in the second week of September before the end of the Syrian chemical weapons crisis and the stronger pound sent wholesale prices tumbling, the motoring organisation said. The cheapest price for supermarket petrol in built-up areas ranges from 126.7p in towns with strong competition to 131.9p in those without, usually small market and coastal towns like Clacton-on-Sea, Trowbridge and Newark. Last week, however, some non-supermarket fuel stations in London's Streatham and Mortlake areas were able to sell petrol at 124.9p a litre. The cost of diesel also continued to fall, down from an average of 139.12p a litre in mid October to 137.78p now. It had also hit a late summer high in the second week of September, reaching 142.88p. At about 7p a litre more expensive than petrol, diesel's differential is largely consistent with the November price gap over the past two years. A family with two petrol cars was spending the equivalent of £252.54 a month on fuel in September, now it's £238.05 . Edmund King, the AA's president, said: . 'On average, 28 per cent of AA members buy a set amount of fuel each . time they go to a petrol station. 'This rises to 40 per cent for younger drivers and 44 per cent for lower-income ones. In September, a £30 spend bought them 21.7 litres and now it buys them 23 - a boost equal to a free 10-mile round trip to work. 'A family with two petrol cars was spending the equivalent of £252.54 a month on fuel in September, now it's £238.05. 'A company with 100 Ford Mondeos was spending typically £10,000 to fill them up with diesel in mid September, now it's around £9,640. 'Last week, it was officially recognised that lower pump prices helped to bring inflation down to 2.2 per cent. 'You cannot understate the importance of lower pump prices.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Rebecca Berry, who suffered from a curved spine for more than ten years has claimed that her condition was cured in just four weeks... by yoga . A woman who suffered from a curved spine so bad that she hid under baggy clothes for more than a decade, has claimed that her condition was cured in just four weeks - by yoga. Rebecca Berry, 29, planned to travel the world after finishing education indulging her love of scuba diving. But she was struck down by a crippling back condition in her late teens. By the time she went to university she had been diagnosed with scoliosis - curvature of the spine. For nearly a decade she wore clothes more than four sizes too big as she became embarrassed and ashamed about her deformity. She refused surgery that would leave her unable to walk for nearly six months and instead researched her condition online. Ms Berry, from Downham Market, Norfolk, got in touch with experts at the Scoliosis SOS clinic and was stunned to find an exercise programme that seemed to cure her condition. After a consultation she began their four-week treatment course of yoga-like exercises and massages and said her spine was corrected within a month. She said is now planning to finally pull on her backpack and spend 2014 fulfilling her travel dream. 'My condition didn't just stop me from doing things from a physical point of view. 'It was also the psychological aspect that went with being diagnosed with what I felt could end up being a horrible deformity. 'I went from feeling normal and perfectly happy with my body, to being paranoid that people were staring at me. 'I felt like I couldn't get in the water, not just because of the pain, but because I couldn't bear people seeing me in a bikini. 'I feel like a new person now, my back is straighter and I feel like I look normal again. I have my confidence back and I am ready to travel the world. X-Ray of Rebecca's spine before her treatment. For nearly a decade she wore clothes more than four sizes too big as she became embarrassed and ashamed about her deformity . 'I am also looking forward to buying a whole new wardrobe full of clothes that actually fit me and don't look like a tent.' Current treatment for Ms Berry's condition is to wait until the curve becomes so severe that surgery is the only option. It means sufferers are faced with having metal rods inserted either side of the spine until it is fused solid in a straight line. But leaving it untreated increases the risk of potentially fatal heart and lung conditions. After a consultation she began their four-week treatment course of yoga-like exercises and massages and her spine was corrected within a month. Now she is finally able to spend time on her favourite sport - scuba diving . Ms Berry, who has held a number of part-time jobs since graduating, said she is delighted she avoided going under the knife. She said: 'I was so desperate to avoid the surgery, I would have tried anything. I am just so lucky that I found the clinic when I did. 'Osteopathy and other treatments just didn't work. 'They would help for about an hour and then the pain would return, I just felt like it was getting worse and my life was spiralling out of control.'","Rebecca Berry, 29, planned to travel world indulging her love of scuba diving .

"By . Jason Groves . Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw suggested last night that he may have been sacked by Tony Blair following pressure from George Bush’s White House. Mr Straw, who was Foreign Secretary during the Iraq war in 2003, was demoted three years later to Leader of the Commons. Yesterday, he said hawkish allies of Mr Bush may have had a hand in his removal after he ruled out Britain ever joining an attack against Iran. Sacked: Jack Straw, who was Foreign Secretary during the Iraq war in 2003, was demoted three years later to Leader of the Commons after, he believes, the intervention of senior figures in the Bush administration . He said neo-conservatives in the White House such as UN ambassador John Bolton were ‘never terribly keen on me’. But he conceded that his public insistence in 2004 that war against Iran was ‘inconceivable’ also led to a rift with Mr Blair. Asked by Total Politics magazine whether he believed the Bush administration played a hand in his sacking, he replied: ‘People say that. The neo-cons, people like John Bolton, were never terribly keen on me, but I’ve no idea what observations were made through the back door. ‘Tony and I were getting to a different place on handling Iran, and Tony certainly felt disconcerted when I said that it was inconceivable that the UK would go to war with Iran and described a nuclear attack as nuts. Close: Former Prime Minister Tony Blair, left, with former President George W. Bush, whose allies Mr Straw says plotted his removal from the Cabinet after he ruled out British involvement in an attack on Iran . ‘As events have proved, we haven’t been involved in military action in Iran – it’s inconceivable now – there’s no way a British House of Commons would approve any kind of military action in Iran. 'And a nuclear strike remains nuts.’ Mr Straw suggested he could have extended Mr Blair’s tenure at No10 if he had remained at the Foreign Office, but Mr Blair’s decision to exile him to the Commons in 2005 made it impossible for him to save the Prime Minister from himself.","He says U.S. hawks plotted his removal after he ruled out UK attack on Iran .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Breakthrough? Scientists at Baltimore University found MS is rare near the equator . Vitamin D may be able to combat multiple sclerosis, researchers said yesterday. They discovered that it can block the migration of destructive cells to the brain, which causes the condition. This could help explain anecdotal reports that the ‘sunshine vitamin’ prevents or eases symptoms. MS is most commonly found far from the equator, where there is less sunshine to trigger production of vitamin D in the skin. The disease is caused by the body’s own immune defences damaging myelin, a fatty insulating sheath that surrounds nerve fibres and is vital to the proper transmission of nerve signals. Destruction of myelin leads to symptoms ranging from numbness to blurred vision and paralysis. Researchers simultaneously gave mice the rodent form of MS and a high dose of vitamin D. They found symptoms of the disease were suppressed. ‘Vitamin D might be working not by altering the function of damaging immune cells but by preventing their journey into the brain,’ said lead scientist Anne Gocke, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. In a person with MS, immune system cells called T-cells are primed to travel out from the lymph nodes and seek and destroy myelin in the central nervous system. While large numbers of T-cells were found in the bloodstreams of the mice, very few were detected in their brains and spinal cords. 'Vitamin D doesn’t seem to cause global immunosuppression,' said Dr Gocke. 'What’s interesting is that the T-cells are primed, but they are being kept away from the places in the body where they can do the most damage.' Tests: Researchers found Vitamin D suppressed symptoms of blurred visions and mobility issues in mice . The vitamin may slow production of a sticky substance that allows the T-cells to attach onto blood vessel walls, she added. This may help to keep them in circulation and prevent their migration to the brain. Once vitamin D was withdrawn from the mice, MS flare-ups occurred very quickly, said the researchers, whose findings appear in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. Peter Calabresi, a professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins and co-author of the study, said: 'Vitamin D may be a very safe therapy, but we still have to be careful with it. It’s not just a vitamin. It’s actually a hormone.' A clinical trial testing the effect of vitamin D supplements on patients with MS is currently under way at Johns Hopkins University.","Disease is most common far from the equator, Baltimore researchers found .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Frantic: Jake Harris, 21, stabbed himself to death with a broken wine glass in a 'frantic attempt' to stop the effects of a former legal high, an inquest heard . A father-to-be stabbed himself to death with a broken wine glass in a ‘frantic attempt’ to stop the effects of a potent former legal high, an inquest heard. Jake Harris, 21, became agitated after taking the ‘N-Bomb’ drug before throwing himself at a window. He then smashed a glass and stabbed himself repeatedly in the neck at a party in Salford, Manchester. A coroner has now issued a warning over the illegal drug, which is a powerful hallucinogen similar to LSD. An inquest into the death of Mr Harris, a lifeguard from Rochdale, heard the drug was behind the deaths of two young men in Australia - one who jumped out of a window and another who beat himself to death. The drug, which was banned in the UK just days after the incident, has also been blamed for half a dozen deaths in the US. Tests on Mr Harris’s body showed alcohol and traces of cocaine but although no evidence of N-Bomb was discovered, assistant Bolton coroner Geoff Saul ruled that there was ‘significant circumstantial evidence’ that he had taken the drug on a strip of paper he believed was soaked in LSD. Similar in chemical make-up to LSD, it can give the distorted appearance that time and movement are going faster or slower. Colour, sound and objects can get distorted visually and users can experience extreme double vision. Mr Harris, who worked as a lifeguard at leisure centre Whitworth Baths and was expecting a baby with his girlfriend, died on May 28 last year, two days after taking the drug at a party. Lethal reaction: N-bomb has since been reclassified as an illegal substance since a number of deaths were linked to the drug . Fear: The coroner presiding over Mr Harris's inquest issued a warning over the illegal drug, which is a powerful hallucinogen similar to LSD . Distressed: An inquest was told that Mr Harris became agitated after taking the 'N-Bomb' drug before throwing himself at a window . N-Bomb is known to have killed at least five people in US states including Arizona, North Dakota and Louisiana. Noah Carrasco, 18, of Scottsdale, Arizona, died in January after taking N-Bomb, which he mistakenly thought was LSD. Anthony Carlson, also 18 and from Scottsdale, died three months later after taking just a few drops of the drug up his nose. And Clayton Otwell, 21, of Little Rock, Arkansas, died in October 2012 after taking a single drop of the drug at a festival. Other deaths have been reported to be linked to N-Bomb over the last few years in California, Texas, Louisiana, Minnesota and Virginia. The drug can be consumed in powder or liquid form. He had been on a night out clubbing in Manchester before heading to the party with his friend Steven Higgins, 27, at a luxury flat in Salford. The inquest was told Heather Turner, 28, who lived in the flat, had already picked up some cocaine and vodka to share with revellers but Mr Higgins supplied the N-Bomb drug to his friend. He believed it was LSD and said he wanted to 'test' its effect before visiting the Glastonbury festival. Bolton coroners’ court was told Mr Harris snorted cocaine and drank vodka before he took the ‘strip’ of the drug - which is also known as ‘smiles’ or ‘25I’ after its chemical name 25I-NBOMe. Witnesses said he at first appeared calm but become agitated and was heard to shouting and pleading, ‘I want it to stop’ as he suffered from terrifying hallucinations. The inquest heard Mr Harris threw himself at a floor-to-ceiling window then smashed a glass on a bedside cabinet and stabbed himself repeatedly in the neck with a thick shard. Friends battled to stem the wound and he was rushed to hospital, but the inquest heard he lost so much blood that his brain was damaged after he suffered a cardiac arrest. The drug has been banned since June 10, 2013 under a temporary class drug order and will remain illegal for at least 12 months while drug experts consider the full range of harms. Police arrested Miss Turner and Mr Higgins over the tragedy but concluded no crime had been committed as the drug was a legal high. Mr Saul recorded a verdict of death by misadventure and issued a warning over the drug. Drug: Bolton coroners' court was told Mr Harris snorted cocaine and drank vodka before he took the 'strip' of the drug - which is also known as 'smiles' or '25I' after its chemical name 25I-NBOMe . Involved: Steven Higgins (pictured) supplied the N-Bomb drug to Jake believing it to be LSD, which he wanted to 'test' before visiting the Glastonbury music festival in June, the inquest was told . 'On the balance of probability, I find that he did take it and he suffered an adverse reaction as a consequence,' he said. 'There are reports of highly disturbed reactions. 'He may have stabbed himself in a frantic attempt to stop the effects of the drug.' Mr Harris went to a luxury flat at the Spectrum apartment complex near Manchester city centre . High spirits: Mr Harris had been on a night out clubbing in Manchester before heading to the party with his friend Steven Higgins, 27, at the apartment . Tragedy: The inquest heard Mr Harris threw himself at a floor-to-ceiling window then smashed a glass on a bedside cabinet in the flat and stabbed himself in the neck . The coroner added: 'What was thought to be LSD was a substance known as 25I-NBOMe. 'In my judgment, there is strong circumstantial evidence that he did in fact take the substance. 'On the balance of probability, there was a deliberate intention by Jake to take the tablet for recreational purposes. There were unintended consequences.' Hearing: Bolton Coroner's Court was told that there had been a deliberate intention by Mr Harris to take the tablet for 'recreational purposes'","Jake Harris, 21, became agitated after taking the 'N-bomb' drug at a party .
