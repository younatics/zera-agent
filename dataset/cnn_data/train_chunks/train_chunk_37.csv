"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- TV dance judge Mary Murphy said singer Chris Brown's attack on his girlfriend, Rihanna, prompted her to talk publicly about spousal abuse that she says she suffered first as a teenage bride three decades ago. Mary Murphy says she was abused by her ex-husband during their nine-year marriage. Murphy -- the vivacious judge on Fox TV's ""So You Think You Can Dance"" -- told CNN's Larry King that she wants other victims to learn from how she endured, but escaped, domestic violence. Discovering her talent with dance eventually changed her life and helped her flee the relationship after nine years, she said. Her ex-husband strongly denied that he ever physically or mentally abused Murphy, whom he married in 1978 soon after they met as teenagers in college. ""I did just tuck it away and just buried it and went on with my life and I thought that, you know, I could leave it there and I wanted to leave it there until my father died a couple years ago,"" Murphy said.  Watch Murphy discuss abuse in her marriage Â» . Discussions with her dying father led to him apologizing for not being ""my knight in shining armor"" by intervening, she said. But Murphy said seeing a photo of singer Rihanna's bruised face, taken soon after Brown's admitted attack last February, convinced her to go public with the story. ""I still had no intention to talk to anybody until I saw Rihanna's face and seeing that just brought it all up."" ""Abuse, it just survives and thrives in silence,"" Murphy said. US Weekly magazine's current issue offers a detailed version of Murphy's revelations in its cover story. Murphy tells the magazine about a whirlwind romance that began in 1977 when she was a 19-year-old Ohio State University student -- swept off her feet by an 18-year-old who was ""extraordinarily handsome."" She told King that the marriage began ""getting out of control"" after just three months when her husband's jealously triggered fights. ""It increased until we started to have just horrible fights,"" she said. ""And then at the time, after a fight in which I didn't want to have sex, it just escalated to the point that he literally had to rape me in order for me to have sex."" When a neighbor called police to her home, Murphy said she was too frightened to press charges. ""I looked at him and with the look on his face, I said 'absolutely not' and went back in my room and just laid there and cried,"" she said. Murphy said she left her husband several times over the nine-year marriage, but ""there weren't the shelters that there are today."" ""I did try to leave, and I was having a hard time making it, and he would sweet talk me and I would go back"" she said. ""It was back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And I don't feel really proud of that."" Murphy discovered her talent and love of dance several years into the marriage when she took a summer job at a dance studio while her husband was away for several months running the family's business in the Middle East, she said. ""It made me feel beautiful instead of how I was probably really feeling inside, totally ashamed and dirty,"" she said. Their marriage ended only after she and her husband renewed their vows in a wedding ceremony in front of his family and friends in Amman, Jordan, in 1985. She learned he had a girlfriend -- to whom he was engaged -- in the Middle East. It was his infidelity that convinced her to divorce him, she said. Her former husband -- who spoke to Larry King off the air -- said he was ""totally shocked"" by Murphy's account of their marriage. ""I never harmed her,"" he said. ""If all of these allegations are true, she could have had me deported,"" he said. He is not a U.S. citizen. He questioned if her motivation was ""more fame or sympathy."" Still, he said he is ""very, very proud"" of her. Murphy told King his response is what she expected. ""I think a lot of men out there, by the way, that when they do get married they feel like this is their right to do whatever they want to do, and it's not,"" she said. ""And I was a scared, frightened person."" Murphy said she is still afraid of her former husband. ""I'm not going to lie to you that he still scares me,"" she said. ""I still live in fear that he will do something to me, that I will go missing."" Fear of not being able to make it on her own still drives her today, she said. ""I put this behind me, went out and worked like I've never worked before,"" she said. ""And I still work today like I could still be homeless.""","""So You Think You Can Dance"" judge says she was abused teenage bride .

"(CNN) -- ""By blood, I am Albanian. By citizenship, an Indian. By faith, I am a Catholic nun. As to my calling, I belong to the world."" Mother Teresa, pictured in 1997, lived and worked in Kolkata from 1931 until her death. That's how Mother Teresa chose to describe herself in life. In death, however, her words will probably do little to settle a diplomatic squabble over her remains. The Albanian government wants to receive her remains before her 100th birthday next year. Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha said his nation plans to open a museum in Mother Teresa's honor and has planned commemorative events. But more important, Berisha said, Mother Teresa should rest next to her mother and sister, who are buried in a cemetery in the Albanian capital, Tirana. ""She missed them very much all her life,"" he said. ""My request is a very human one. ""She told me that she prayed every day for her family and her country. That's why I think both governments should talk about [this] and find a solution,"" Berisha said. Then there is Macedonia, the nation where Mother Teresa was born and raised. It, too, may stake a claim on the woman who is well on a path to sainthood. But India, the land where she made her life's work, has made it clear that Mother Teresa, buried in the heart of Kolkata (formerly known as Calcutta), will not be leaving her final resting place. ""Mother Teresa was a citizen of India,"" said Vishnu Prakash, spokesman for the country's external affairs ministry. Though she arrived as a foreigner, Mother Teresa came to be cherished in her adopted home. In billboards and booklets, the city of Kolkata proudly claims her as one of its most famous citizens. She was a devout Catholic who transcended religion, inspiring a nation of millions of poor people, mostly Hindus and Muslims. She is buried in the courtyard at the nondescript Missionaries of Charity compound in central Kolkata, a site visited by residents and tourists alike. People stream in from the bustling streets to the serenity of Mother House to pay their respects -- and find strength in her presence. They wander among her order of nuns in their simple blue-bordered white cotton saris. On the second floor is the small and sparse room that belonged to Mother Teresa. ""She has become part and parcel of our national life,"" said Father Babu Joseph, spokesman for the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India. ""She built a strong bond with India,"" he said. ""People of all religious groups here rather consider her an inalienable part [of India] and therefore we would strongly want the remains to be in India."" Mother Teresa was born as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu to ethnic Albanian parents in Skopje, Macedonia, on August 26, 1910. At 18, she left home and joined the Sisters of Loreto, arriving in India in 1931. Moved by staggering poverty and human suffering, she started the Missionaries of Charity, dedicating her life to helping those in need. She became a fixture on the streets of Kolkata, often picking up the sick and hungry, and giving them food, shelter and love. When she accepted her Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, she asked that the gala dinner be canceled and the money be sent instead to help Kolkata's destitute. Mother Teresa was 87 when she died in 1997, the news eclipsed by Princess Diana's death several days earlier. Pope John Paul II beatified Mother Teresa in 2003 and she could be canonized by her centennial birthday next year -- a saint in the heavens whose resting place on Earth remains a devilish debate.","Mother Teresa lived, worked mostly in Kolkata but was ethnically Albanian .

"(CNN)  -- The recession means competition in pro football this year isn't restricted to the gridiron. The National Football League and its 32 teams also are battling for the consumer's discretionary spending dollars. Less-established NFL teams, such as the Jacksonville Jaguars, face special challenges in the recession. And just like on the playing field, some teams are having an easier time scoring an economic touchdown than others. ""Overall ticket sales are very positive but difficult in these challenging times,"" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said in a statement. He did not provide overall ticket sales numbers for the current season. The league is coming off a year that saw overall attendance drop slightly, 0.7 percent, from 2007 amid the start of the economic slowdown. Bill Prescott, a Jacksonville Jaguars vice president and the team's chief financial officer, said the team started to see the impact of the recession last year, when single-game ticket sales and concession revenue dropped as the season progressed. Heading into this season, he said, sales are off even more than the team expected -- new ticket sales are down 75 percent from last year and season ticket renewals are down 10 percent. No Jaguar games are sold out, despite a recent survey by The Media Audit that found 76 percent of adults in Jacksonville, Florida, regularly follow the Jaguars -- the fifth-best percentage of any NFL market. ""The economy is having that impact on us,"" Prescott said. ""As a very small market, I think we're feeling it more than some of the other teams in the league."" The Minnesota Vikings also have yet to sell out any of their games, though the team expects that could change with the recent high-profile signing of quarterback Brett Favre. Within a day of Favre's signing, the Vikings had sold an additional 3,000 season tickets and 10,000 single-game tickets. ""The economy's affecting all professional sports teams,"" said Steve LaCroix, the Vikings' vice president of sales and marketing. ""We're not only competing for people's time and money, but trying to keep the fans in the stadium on game day as opposed to watching on TV."" LaCroix said there weren't a large number of cancellations in season ticket holder accounts. However, some fans did trim down the number of seats in their respective accounts. LaCroix added some are coming back on board as the season approaches. The Cincinnati Bengals are getting nationwide exposure through the HBO reality series ""Hard Knocks,"" which chronicles the team's training camp and preparation for the upcoming season. However, the Bengals' streak of 44 straight sellouts, a franchise record, is at risk, according to spokesman Jim Brennan. The Bengals' September 13 home opener against Denver is not sold out yet. Some teams, however, are more than holding their own as far as ticket sales go despite the nation's fiscal woes. The Denver Broncos are sold out for the 40th straight year -- dating back to the first game of the 1970 season, according to spokesman Jim Saccomano. And Chicago Bears spokesman Scott Hagel says the team is sold out for the 25th straight season. He adds the season ticket renewal rate is well over 90 percent, on par with the prior decade. According to league spokesman McCarthy, 24 of the NFL's 32 teams did not raise ticket prices from last year. One of the teams that did is the Indianapolis Colts, which bumped up the cost of 10 percent of its season ticket holder seats, according to team spokesman Craig Kelley. All games are sold out. Two factors working in the Colts' favor -- they have a new stadium that opened last season and the team has been a perennial contender for the past decade. In order to try and offset the impact the economy has on the game, McCarthy said teams have created more options and flexibility for fans in order to help them afford tickets. Among those options are half-season ticket plans, such as the ones offered by the Jaguars and the New York Jets. ""We knew some season ticket holders because of the economy wouldn't be able to afford to come to all 10 games (including the preseason),"" said the Jaguars' Prescott. The half-season plan has been very popular, he said. ""We wanted to make as many products available to them whether they could come to one game, two games or with the half package we've bundled five games in each package so they can come for half a season."" Prescott said the team is also considering introducing a package where fans can purchase tickets for a few games of their choice. David Carter, executive director of the USC Sports Business Institute, thinks the best way for teams to limit the recession's impact on ticket sales is to offer exemplary customer service. ""These fans need to feel as though they're having a great time and they're getting value for their money,"" said Carter. ""If they're able to do that, they will justify continuing to spend on the NFL, because every game matters. They want to be part of the continuity of the NFL season."" Carter believes the league has to fight the recession on two fronts. He says the first is the pricing of seats to everyday fans -- especially those in markets where the demand isn't as keen as the NFL would like. The second challenge is corporate resistance. ""You have those that have traditionally purchased seats or acquired sponsorships taking a long look at whether they want to be involved this year or not, and a lot of corporate budgets are already in bed for the rest of the year,"" explained Carter. Still, Carter believes the NFL may be well-equipped to weather the economic storm, thanks in large part to timing. ""There's a general feel that things are picking up in the economy, and I think that's going to bode well for them over time. They may have survived this downturn a little better than the other leagues."" Matt Gonter has been a Washington Redskins season ticket holder for the past five years. He said he briefly considered whether to cancel his subscription heading into this year but decided against it -- citing the team's long waiting list to get season tickets. ""I swore to myself if I ever got Redskins season tickets, I'd do everything in my power to keep them,"" Gonter said. However, he did turn down an option to upgrade to different seats and a parking pass, saying he would have considered it in years past but not under the current economic climate. He also might sell his tickets for certain games online. ""I'm thinking of going on StubHub and selling a couple of tickets. I eat so much of the cost for the preseason tickets, because you have to pay full price for those,"" Gonter said. One ticket for an NFL game this year on the secondary ticket seller goes for an average of $151, compared with $156 at this time a year ago. Four-year Cleveland Browns season ticket holder Zeke Paster held on to his subscription and plans to make cutbacks instead when it comes to concessions and tailgating costs. However, he may get rid of some of his tickets before the season is over. ""If they're not doing well, I would maybe try to sell the tickets for some of the cold weather games,"" Paster said. Paster and Gonter admit surrendering their season ticket packages for good would be a painful decision. ""The atmosphere is unmatched,"" Paster said. ""There's nothing like being in the stadium or in the parking lot when the Browns are doing well."" Gonter says the camaraderie is worth the cost. ""I just like the experience of sitting in the parking lot under a tent, tailgating, drinking beer and then going to the game and having a good time watching the Redskins.""","For Jacksonville Jaguars, ticket sales off more than expected .

"CNNU campus correspondent Brandon Gates is a junior at University of South Carolina. CNNU is a feature that provides student perspectives on news and trends from colleges across the United States. The views expressed in this article are not necessarily those of CNN, its affiliates or the schools where the campus correspondents are based. Some of the students killed were affiliated with the Delta Delta Delta sorority, whose house is pictured above. COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN) -- At the University of South Carolina, the campus is quiet, but students were still heading to their classes after six students were killed in a beach house fire during the weekend. The school is planning a short ceremony Monday evening to honor the six students who were killed Sunday morning in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina. A seventh person killed is believed to be a student at Clemson University. Their identities had not yet been released Monday afternoon. The USC students were affiliated with the Delta Delta Delta sorority and the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. ""The fraternities are praying for them and their families for the loss. It's something we're all affected by,"" Jay Laura, student president of the USC chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. In a later news conference, Laura said the outpouring of condolences was a testament to the character of the fraternity brothers who died. He also said he was proud of the way the university was coming together to support each other. Lauren Hodge, the chapter president of Delta Delta Delta, said the sorority would have ministers and counselors at the sorority house to help USC students. ""We're trying to everything we can right now to help people cope,"" she said. ""We've spent a lot of time (counseling) with the students from the sorority and fraternity,"" said Dennis A. Pruitt, the vice president for student affairs. ""We encourage any student who is just learning of the situation and is a member of Tri-Delta or SAE to contact their parents and let them know they're OK."" The school decided against canceling classed on Monday. ""Going back to normal, everyday activities may be the best way for some to mourn and grieve,"" Pruitt said. A weekly concert that is typically a well-attended event failed to bring out students on Monday. Most students appeared to be spending time in their dorm rooms where counseling was offered. ""I feel shocked that something like that could happen here. You always see stuff like that happening at other schools, but you never it can happen to your school,"" said Artifa Ricks, a sophomore majoring in broadcasting. Six other University of South Carolina students were treated for injuries at a local hospital and released, the school said. The university is providing counseling and assistance to students who have requested it. ""When any one member of our family is lost, every one of us is diminished.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Last week's ""balloon boy"" incident is being investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration, an agency representative said Tuesday. The Heene family -- including Falcon, second from right -- on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" last week. Richard and Mayumi Heene, whose son Falcon was thought for several hours to have flown away in a homemade balloon, are facing a number of local charges, a Colorado sheriff said this week. The Fort Collins couple could be charged with conspiracy, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and attempting to influence a public servant, Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden said Sunday. The family also probably will be charged with filing a false police report, which is a misdemeanor, Alderden said. Their lawyer, David Lane, said the sheriff was overreaching and that the family deserves the presumption of innocence.  Watch the Heenes' friends talk about the incident Â» . FAA spokeswoman Diane Spitaliere confirmed Tuesday that the agency was ""investigating the circumstances"" of the incident, in which police and military scrambled to rescue the 6-year-old boy, who later turned out to be hiding in his family's attic. A source familiar with the investigation said no record has been found indicating that Richard Heene called the FAA. The agency does not record all of its calls, and the search for a record of any call is continuing, the source said. The Heenes may have violated FAA regulations barring people from flying balloons or kites within 5 miles of an airport, an FAA official said. The official declined to be named because the case is under investigation. The giant silver balloon was apparently not visible on radar, the official said, and the FAA is relying on pilot reports to determine its approximate flight path during the roughly three hours it was aloft Thursday. CNN's Mike M. Ahlers in Washington contributed to this story.","Federal Aviation Administration looking into ""escaped balloon"" story .

"CALAIS, France (CNN) -- French authorities on Tuesday dismantled a makeshift camp dubbed ""the Jungle,"" which housed illegal migrants fleeing dangerous homelands to seek a more prosperous life in Europe. After being forced from their makeshift home, occupants of ""the Jungle"" were driven away in buses for processing. French police broke up protests by refugee rights advocates and began clearing the squalid camp. The French government said it was targeting human smuggling and did not say where the migrants would be relocated. Police arrested 276 migrants, 125 of whom were minors, said Calais prefecture official Catherine Mande.  See photos of police clearing the camp Â» . A statement from the French immigration minister's office said the ""illegal encampments"" would be destroyed and then three bulldozers, a dozen trucks and a logging company would return the land to its natural state.  Watch a report on the camp's closure Â» . The statement said the goal was to destroy the Jungle and other migrant shanties, ""which have become the main launch pad for clandestine immigration into the United Kingdom."" Was the French government right to demolish the illegal migrant camp? Aided by smugglers, many of the migrants in coastal northern France attempt to make it into Britain, hiding in trucks that cross the English Channel. France and Britain signed an agreement in July to crack down on illegal immigration, including dispersing the migrants at the Jungle. British Home Secretary Alan Johnson said he was ""delighted"" to hear that France was honoring the agreement. ""The measures that we have put in place are not only there to prevent illegal immigration but also to stop people trafficking,"" he said. ""We are working with the French not only to strengthen our shared border but that of Europe as a whole."" Johnson said both nations were committed ""to helping individuals who are genuine refugees."" Others who don't need protection were expected to return home, he said. The Jungle -- shanties cobbled from cardboard, plastic tarpaulins and scraps of wood -- housed as many as 1,000 men from nations such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and Somalia. Camp resident Mohammed Bashir escaped the Taliban in Afghanistan and made a new home in a tent here, among the heaps of garbage, sand and bramble on the outskirts of the French port city of Calais. Sometimes, eight men shared the tent. ""I never lived in such a condition like this back home, but right now we don't have any other choice,"" said Bashir, 24, who left behind his family. ""It's very difficult, very hard for a person who has children and parents."" Desperation filled the air in the Jungle. Many residents survived arduous and illegal treks from their homelands. Some held ambitions to keep going another 20 miles, across the water to Britain. Others hoped to realize refugee status in France.  See a map of the region Â» . But Tuesday, they were forced to put their plans on hold as they were evicted from the Jungle. Refugee advocates circled the migrants and scuffled with police to keep them at bay. But eventually, the protests were broken up, the migrants were taken away and the shanties started coming down. The French government's decision drew criticism from humanitarian workers who don't think that demolishing the camp will help resolve illegal immigration issues. They say moving the migrants is simply displacing the problem. ""We don't know where they're going to go,"" said Matthieu Tardis, an advocate for asylum seekers. ""We don't know what the government plans to do. We are not respecting human rights here, for sure."" The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees sent staff to Calais earlier in the summer to counsel people about asylum procedures in France and Britain. According to the U.N. agency, most of the illegal migrants enter Europe through Greece and often fall victim to smugglers who turn a profit by helping migrants reach their destinations. The camp residents who fled Afghanistan told CNN they had paid smugglers large sums. They were promised much more than the filthy camp, they said. Bashir said he had no choice but to flee his home after Taliban militants accused him of spying. ""When they don't need you, they just slaughter you,"" he said. ""They threatened me that [I would] be slaughtered."" Bashir's future remains uncertain as ever. He is sure only of one thing: He cannot go home.","French police arrest 276 migrants at ""Jungle"" camp, 125 were minors .

"(CNN) -- The announcement that Chicago, Illinois, will not host the 2016 Olympic Games took the hopeful wind out of many in the Windy City. Dreams of hosting the 2016 Olympics were dashed for many Chicagoans. But for others, the news was welcome. But for almost half of the city's dwellers, the International Olympic Committee's decision was winning news. A spokeswoman for No Games Chicago, a grass-roots organization opposed to hosting the Olympics, said she was ""relieved"" by the vote Friday in Copenhagen, Denmark. Chicago's Olympic fever, spotty as it was, broke abruptly when the city was the first of four final contenders to be knocked out of the running. The prospective host cities had been whittled down to four finalists -- Chicago; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Tokyo, Japan; and Madrid, Spain. The bid went to Rio de Janeiro, making it the first South American city to host the Olympic Games. Chicago had been seen as a front-runner in recent days, especially after it sent to Copenhagen America's biggest guns -- President Obama and his popular wife, Michelle -- for a last-minute sales pitch. But a poll taken by the Chicago Tribune and CNN affiliate WGN revealed in early September that 45 percent of the city residents didn't want the Olympic Games. And 84 percent of Chicagoans objected to the idea of public money being used to support the effort. Earlier this week, about 250 Olympic-bid protesters gathered in front of City Hall, WGN reported. A sign in the crowd read: ""Have the audacity of nope."" Many who gathered for the bid slapdown were affiliated with No Games Chicago, which sent three delegates to Copenhagen to state their case. After the vote, however, spokeswoman Francesca Rodriguez said No Games Chicago is ""in no way taking any pleasure in this"" and feels ""sympathy"" for those who are disappointed. ""In reality, Chicagoans who were for the Games and those who were against them were committed to the same goal: Working hard for what they thought would be best for the city of Chicago in the coming decades,"" she said. ""We're glad that the city won't now be burdened by the distraction of the Olympics at the expense of improving Chicago's schools, transportation, parks and the numerous other public policy initiatives on which the city needs to be focused."" Those who believe the Olympics can bring lasting change to a city -- beyond the spike in economic activity during the event -- are often misguided, suggested economist Rob Baade of Lake Forest College in Lake Forest, Illinois. ""There is no reason to expect that the Olympics, or any mega-event, is going to induce a sustainable boost in the economy,"" he said. ""The cost overruns are pretty legendary. Costs are generally understated and the gains overstated."" One Web site set up to rally against bringing the Olympic Games to town relied as much on humor as it did reason. Its name: Chicagoans for Rio 2016. The site showcased unflattering head-to-head comparisons, such as ""Naked people dancing"" vs. ""Chubby people eating."" The increasing budget deficit in Chicago was contrasted with a $0 total for Rio. ""If you're a Chicagoan, Rio's budget deficit does not matter,"" the site said. ""It would be exciting to host the Olympics here in Chicago. But you know what would be even better? Rio de Janeiro,"" the site announced. ""Just let Rio host the 2016 Olympics. We don't mind. Honest."" Wish granted.","For about half of Chicago's dwellers, losing out on the Olympics is welcome news .

"Editor's note: Nell Minow is editor and chairwoman of the Corporate Library, an independent research company, and was named one of the 20 most influential people in corporate governance by Directorship magazine and ""the queen of good corporate governance"" by BusinessWeek Online. She has co-written three books. Nell Minow says AIG's board must be held accountable for the $160 million in bonus payments. (CNN) -- The stories about the outrageous $160 million bonus payments at AIG have all omitted the most important names. They are the members of AIG's Board of Directors Compensation Committee. These people should have been on the hot seat before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government Sponsored Enterprises, alongside CEO Ed Liddy. Although there is a lot of blame to go around, ultimately the buck stops -- or, I should say, the bucks should have stopped -- with them. Why haven't we learned that it is the boards who are responsible for the massive failures of strategy and risk management at these companies? Regulators, journalists, securities analysts and investors routinely ignore the most obvious indicators of investment risk that are presented by bad boards of directors. This is particularly obvious in the case of AIG, which has been a serial offender in corporate governance, especially in executive compensation. Those of us who remember former CEO Hank Greenberg's departure from AIG in 2005, after a corporate governance meltdown that included excessive compensation, appreciate the irony of his comment to ABC News that the retention bonuses were ""mind-boggling."" Mr. Kettle, Pot is on line 1. Compensation committees are not responsible for individual pay packages below the CEO, but they are responsible for determining their overall structure -- and for making sure that the CEO's job includes effective management on compensation issues. Retention of employees may be a legitimate goal of a compensation program, but it can be accomplished in a way that is both effective and credible by being tied to performance goals and by delaying vesting until after the bailout funds are returned to taxpayers. The Corporate Library released a report in February about the boards of the bailout companies, many of which were outliers in their governance and compensation practices. Some of these were clear indicators of investment and liability risk. In several cases, we found individuals who not only sat on more than four corporate boards but also sat on more than one of these particularly troubled boards during this period. Former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, for example, served on the boards of Morgan Stanley, General Motors and Wachovia -- and at various times was also a director at Merck, VF Corp., Krispy Kreme and Cousins Properties. Several other directors from these troubled boards also sat on either five or six boards altogether. We call the phenomenon of directors who serve on four or more corporate boards ""overboarding."" Overboarding can limit the time and attention a director has for each board. It can also be an indicator of -- or a contributor to -- so many relationships and connections that it makes it more difficult to provide the respectful skepticism necessary for independent oversight. In all, 11 of the 27 companies we identified as ""troubled"" had at least one overboarded director. Six had more than one; at Merrill Lynch, there were five. By comparison, fewer than 30 percent of S&P 500 companies have even a single overboarded director, and fewer than 5 percent have more than one. Another key finding from our analysis: Shareholders at these companies were well aware of the relative weakness of these boards and had expressed their dissatisfaction by withholding votes from many of these individuals the year before these companies collapsed. At least 13 individual directors, all of whom sat on at least three corporate boards during this period, had received a 13 percent or higher negative vote. The highest of these was a 38.58 percent negative vote received by Sir Winfried F.W. Bischoff at McGraw-Hill, where he sat on the compensation committee. Bischoff also served on the boards at Citigroup (as chairman and interim CEO), Eli Lilly and Prudential. Although the businesses of these companies do not overlap enough to impair Bischoff's designation as an ""independent"" director or to create legal conflict of interest concerns, it is relevant that McGraw-Hill owns ratings agency Standard & Poor's, which not only rates the other companies for which he was a director but also issues ratings on which the other companies rely in their assessment of risk. Because of the extensive involvement that financial services companies have in many different aspects of the business of large public corporations, directors of those companies in particular should be especially cautious about overlaps and conflicts. Badly designed compensation is an indicator of poor corporate governance, and poor corporate governance is an indicator of investment risk. Instead of trying to tax the bonuses at AIG, the government and the shareholders should insist on new directors. The company's Web site says the compensation committee has five members. The two longest serving ones are James F. Orr III, who joined the committee on May 17, 2006 and Virginia M. Rometty, who joined it on January 17, 2007, according to the company's 2007 proxy statement. The committee's charter says its responsibility include making recommendations to the full board regarding AIG's compensation programs and reviewing and approving any hiring, severance or termination payments.

"(CNN) -- Twenty-three suspects, including nine American Airlines employees, were arrested Tuesday for allegedly transporting nearly $20 million worth of cocaine on flights into and out of Puerto Rico, federal authorities said. Manuel Santiago-Alvarado, an American Airlines control crew chief, is among the suspects arrested Tuesday. Most of the commercial flights carrying suitcases stuffed with illicit drugs came into San Juan, which was a transshipment point for drugs bound for cities on the U.S. mainland, authorities said. The drug trafficking organization headed by defendant Wilfredo Rodriguez Rosade had been operating since 1999, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI, which participated in the long-running investigation. In a September 9 indictment unsealed Tuesday, Justice Department officials also moved to seize $18 million worth of property owned by the suspects, including seven homes, three businesses and an apartment complex. All but one of the arrests occurred in Puerto Rico. The lone arrest on the U.S. mainland was in Miami, Florida. Drug Enforcement Special Agent in Charge Javier Pena said the airline industry cooperated in the investigation. ""By denying the drug traffickers alternate smuggling routes, we disrupt the flow of drugs into Puerto Rico and discourage the use of the island as a transshipment point in the Caribbean,"" he said in a news release. The agency said that if they are convicted, the defendants taken into custody would face sentences ranging from 10 years to life in prison and personal fines of up to $4 million. American Airlines issued a statement confirming some employees had been arrested, but could not confirm the number because of its privacy policy, spokesman Tim Wagner said in an e-mail. The airline has been working with authorities, he said. ""As a company, we hope that the actions of a few employees don't reflect negatively on the tens of thousands of ethical American Airlines employees who work hard to serve the public daily,"" Wagner wrote.","9 airline employees among those accused of smuggling $20 million in cocaine .

"(CNN) -- The girlfriend of former NFL quarterback Steve McNair had grown frustrated with their relationship and was struggling with financial difficulties in the days before she killed him and herself in July. Steve McNair, former NFL quarterback, was a married father of four when he was killed last summer. Details of their relationship were revealed in a case summary released by Nashville police Monday. McNair, 36, and Sahel Kazemi, 20, were found fatally shot in a condominium in downtown Nashville on July 4. Police have since ruled their deaths a murder-suicide. ""My life is just s--- and I should end it,"" Kazemi said the night before the couple were found dead, according to Sonya New, her shift manager at a Dave & Busters restaurant. New also said Kazemi was not her usual self and seemed down. Though McNair was a married father of four, he was seeing Kazemi and at least one other woman, Leah Ignagni, according to Nashville police. McNair had spent the night at Ignagni's apartment on July 2, two nights before he was killed, Ignagni told police. On the morning of July 4, Kazemi texted McNair, saying she was stressed and needed money to pay bills. ""Baby I might have a break down im so stressed,"" Kazemi said in one text message. ""baby i might need to go to the hospital. baby whats wrong w(ith) me i can hardly breath(e)."" Chris Wall, who provided security for McNair and his family, told police he knew about McNair's relationship with Kazemi. McNair was tired of her calling when he was with his family, Wall said. Kazemi continued to text McNair throughout the day, asking for money and when she could see him next. ""baby what are u doing,"" Kazemi asked. ""At the pool with the kids. I got the guy transferring the money,"" McNair replied. At 4:04 p.m. on July 3, Kazemi said, ""baby I have to be w(ith) u 2nite. I dnt care where."" The messages continued for more than eight hours before McNair said he was on his way to the condo. He had told Kazemi earlier that he wouldn't leave the house ""til the kids fall asleep."" McNair and Kazemi exchanged a final series of messages early July 4, when he asked her to leave the front door to the condo open for him. A final message, sent at 1:14 a.m., simply said, ""its open."" About 12 hours later, a friend of McNair's found their bodies.","McNair and Sahel Kazemi were found fatally shot in a Nashville condo on July 4 .

"(CNN) -- Afraid that her husband will leave her for a younger woman, a 107-year-old Malaysian woman is looking to marry again -- for the 23rd time. Wok Kundor: ""I am an aged woman. I don't have the body nor am I a young woman who can attract anyone."" Wok Kundor has been happily married for four years to her husband, a man 70 years her junior. But since he left their village in northern Terengganu state for a drug rehabilitation program in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, Wok has had a gnawing feeling. ""She said that she has been feeling insecure lately and she needs to find out whether he still loves her or not,"" said R.S.N. Murali, a reporter for The Star. The English-language Malaysian daily was among several local media outlets reporting on the lifelong romantic. ""She is worried he might not come back after his program and find himself a younger wife,"" Murali said. If so, Wok has her eyes set on a 50-year-old man, but hopes it does not come to that. ""I realize that I am an aged woman. I don't have the body nor am I a young woman who can attract anyone,"" she told the newspaper. ""My intention to remarry is to fill my forlornness,"" particularly during the Muslim month of fasting, Ramadan, she said. Malaysian media, which has previously reported on the woman, said Wok has been married 22 times. That would make her marriages last an average of four years. Wok would not discuss past relationships, Murali said. ""Some of her better halves have passed away or have divorced, but she doesn't want to talk about them or her children,"" he said. Wok and her current husband, Mohammed Boor Che Musa, hail from the same village and met there. Muhammad, 37, was quoted in an earlier report as saying the couple fell for each other because it was ""God's will."" On Monday, he told The Star that he is still very much in love with his wife and cannot dream of life with someone else. But Wok wants to hear him say it, Murali said. Soon, the centenarian plans to make the journey to Kuala Lumpur -- if she can find a neighbor to drive her there.","107-year-old Malaysian woman fears husband will leave her for younger woman .

"ACCRA, Ghana (CNN) -- Ghanaians clad in the national colors of red, gold and green celebrated long into the night on Friday as excitement over the national team's penalty shootout victory over Brazil in the final of the Under-20 World Cup in Egypt brought the West African nation to a standstill. Ghana's players celebrate their victory over Brazil. Ghana's victory, 4-3 on penalties after a goalless draw which they had survived since the 37th minute with 10 men, was the first ever by an African side in the tournament. Earlier, many football fans had converged in churches hours before the game to pray for divine intervention. But the triumph, coupled with Nigeria's disappointing performance in the tournament, may be the clearest signal yet that the balance of power in West Africa may have tilted from Nigeria to Ghana once again. Last month Ghana's Black Stars, featuring players like Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien and Inter Milan's Sulley Muntari, became the first African side to qualify for South Africa 2010 World Cup. Nigeria are in danger of missing the World Cup for the second time running. The Super Eagles trail Tunisia by two points in Group B ahead of their last group qualifying matches on November 11 when both countries face tricky away fixtures. Until 2006, Ghana was regarded as the continent's sleeping giants, having dominated African football in the years after it became the first independent sub-Saharan African country over five decades ago. By contrast, it took Nigeria -- Africa's most populous country -- another three decades to establish itself among the continent's top national sides. It was not until Ghana's first appearance at the FIFA World Cup in Germany in 2006 that the four-times winners of the African Cup of Nations regained some of their lost glory. It signaled not only Ghana's long-awaited arrival at football biggest global gathering but also a fulfillment of a prediction in 1990 by Cameroon legend Roger Milla that the world had not seen the best of African football until the Black Stars made it to the World Cup. As continental champions in 1963, 1965, 1978 and 1982 and with Ghanaian legends including three-times African footballer of the year Abedi Pele and former Eintracht Frankfurt and Leeds United star Anthony Yeboah both rated in their time among the world's best players, Milla knew Ghana had the qualities to match some of the world's best. Youth success at the FIFA under-17 championship in 1991 and 1995, two appearances in the final of the under-20 championship in 1993 and 2001 and an Olympic bronze medal in Barcelona in 1992 emphasized Ghana's abundance of talent and unfulfilled promise at the highest level. At Germany 2006, Ghana became the only African survivor after the preliminary round, surprising the bookmakers with victories over the Czech Republic and the U.S. before losing 3-0 to Brazil in a match that was closer than the scoreline suggested. Ghana's squad for next year's World Cup in South Africa will likely include the cream of the team that impressed in Germany, including Essien and Muntari, as well as some of the brilliant youngsters who sparkled this month World Youth Championship in Egypt; notably Golden Ball and Golden Shoe winner Dominic Adiyiah, Ransford Osei and Andre Ayew, the son of Abedi Pele. Following the side's masterful display in Egypt and relatively easy World Cup qualifying campaign, the Black Stars will carry both Ghanaian and African expectations on their shoulders as they bid to improve on the quarterfinal places achieved by Cameroon and Senegal in 1990 and 2002 respectively. With a population of around 140 million and a reputation for producing stars such as Austin Okocha, Nwankwo Kanu and Chelsea's John Obi Mikel, the outstanding qualities of Nigerian football are beyond question. But African football observers believe poor administration by the Nigerian Football Federation and the resultant instability in the technical direction of the team has undermined the development of Nigerian football and resulted in its dwindling fortunes at the world stage. Nigeria emerged as West Africa's leading side in 1980 by wining the African Cup of Nations, a feat they repeated 14 years later in Tunisia. The Super Eagles made their World Cup debut in the U.S. in 1994 and qualified for both France 1998 and Japan/South Korea 2002. Like Ghana, Nigeria has shown promise at youth level, winning U-17 World Cup titles in 1985, 1993 and 2007, and winning Olympic gold at the 1996 Atlanta Games. As host of this year's FIFA Under-17 championship, Nigeria will be hoping to draw inspiration from Ghana's performance in Egypt to retain the title on home soil next month. At continental level, the once powerful Super Eagles are anything but super. Since reaching the final of the 2000 African Nations Cup, Nigeria has failed make any meaningful impact despite parading highly-talented squads. For three successive tournaments Nigeria finished in third place before crashing out at the quarterfinal stage of the 2008 edition in a 2-1 defeat by Ghana. Kwesi Nyantakyi, the 39-year-old president of the Ghana Football Association (GFA), believes the country is reaping the dividends of a professional approach through the implementation of a five-year business plan, which has attracted massive injection of cash through corporate sponsorship from kit sponsor Puma and mining, banking, brewery and telecommunication firms. ""When we took over in 2005 we realized that one of the biggest problems we faced was the availability of timelines of funds needed to prepare the teams adequately, provide the necessary incentives for the players and numeration for the technical staff,"" Nyantakyi says. ""The availability of funding timely and an autonomy for the federation has helped us execute our plans effectively and this is showing in our recent impressive performances."" Beyond monetary considerations and administrative stability, Ghana is also reaping the rewards of years of investment in youth football which has produced players like Essien and Muntari -- and now new kid on the block Adiyiah and others. For now, the country seem to have regained bragging rights as the superpower in West Africa.","Ghana becomes first African nation to win football's Under-20 World Cup .

"(CNN)  -- In trendy neighborhoods of Tokyo customers are lining up for vitamin injections that promise to improve health and beauty. A Japanese woman receives an intravenous vitamin supplement at the Tenteki Cafe in Tokyo. These intravenous vitamin ""drips"" are part of the latest quick-fix, health fad catching on in Japan: the IV cafe. Each drip pack contains saline solution and specific vitamins and minerals to target a particular health ailment or beauty concern. ""I used to take vitamin supplements, but changed to the IV drip because I feel the effects more quickly,"" a 20-something woman at the Tenteki 10 CafÃ© told CNN. She said she receives specific injections to get better skin, burn fat and boost her energy. There are 10 different varieties to choose from at Tenteki. The ""orange"" variety touts anti-aging properties, loaded with antioxidants. The ""placenta pack"" is said to help rejuvenate and ease muscle stiffness. Prices range from $20-$30 per injection, and nurses see about 30-40 people each day. Their most common patients are Japanese businessmen who work in the same office building. ""I see a lot of businessmen who say they don't have time to sleep. They can't take a break from working and get the vitamin drip for an extra kick of energy,"" a Tenteki nurse told CNN. ""Blue"" is the most requested vitamin pack among these men: a concoction of B1 and vitamin E that claims to offer relief from exhaustion. Registered nurses and doctors administer the drips at Tenteki, but there's no conclusive medical evidence to back up the health claims. Many nutritionists actually caution against using injectable vitamin supplements because the quantities are not regulated. ""More is not necessarily better...some vitamins and minerals can be toxic in high doses,"" particularly the fat-soluble ones which the body stores like Vitamins A, D, E and K, explained Claire Williamson, Nutrition Scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation. In Europe and the United States vitamin shots are popular among celebrities with hectic lifestyles and little time to sleep, particularly vitamin B 12. Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and singer Robbie Williams have both confirmed they've used the shots as part of their diets to maintain stamina during tours. Dermatological injections of Vitamin C are also popular among women hoping to keep their skin looking young. Former supermodel Cindy Crawford has admitted using such injections to keep her skin firm and wrinkle-free. According to Williamson, it does not matter if supplements are injected into the vein or into the skin. ""At the end of the day it will go into the blood stream,"" she said. Most of these nutrients we can get sufficient from foods, nutrients tend to be better absorbed by the body if they are consumed in foods.""","Intravenous vitamin boosts are the latest health fad in Japan .

"(CNN) -- A coalition of top musicians, including R.E.M. and Pearl Jam, want to know if their music was used by the U.S. military as part of controversial interrogation methods at the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Ruhal Ahmed, left, shown at a 2007 news conference, says he had to listen to hours of music at Guantanamo. The artists have endorsed a series of Freedom of Information Act requests, which were filed Thursday morning, asking the U.S. government to declassify documents that would reveal which artists' work was used on detainees at U.S. prison facilities and military detention centers, including the one at Guantanamo Bay. The National Security Archive, a Washington-based independent research institute that advocates ""for the right to know,"" filed the requests on behalf of the Close Gitmo Now campaign, which launched this week, the archive's senior analyst Kate Doyle said. The multimillion-dollar national grassroots Close Gitmo Now campaign is aimed at pressuring members of Congress to support President Obama's endeavor to close the Guantanamo Bay prison. It is supported by a coalition of retired generals and liberal activists. The requests are based on the testimony of former Guantanamo prisoners and guards, as well as declassified documents, that identified music from 35 artists -- ranging from AC/DC tunes to the theme from Sesame Street -- used in the interrogations of detainees, Doyle said. See a list of bands and songs involved (PDF) ""We do know that songs and bands' work has been used to abuse detainees, we know that,"" she said. She added that any information that the National Security Archive obtains ""will add to the profile of this case."" The requests are being filed with ""a dozen different agencies and components of the Department of Defense,"" Doyle said. They ask for any documents ""concerning the use of loud music during detention and/or as a technique to interrogate detainees at U.S.-operated prison facilities used in its War on Terror at Guantanamo, Iraq and Afghanistan during 2002-the present,"" according to a copy of the FOIA request obtained by CNN. It is unclear if any of the artists plan to pursue legal action, but Doyle said she'd be ""surprised if some of them weren't thinking about it."" Many of the artists supporting the campaign are no strangers to political activism, but this cause has hit close to home for some of them. ""We have spent the past 30 years supporting causes related to peace and justice. To now learn that some of our friends' music may have been used as part of the torture tactics without their consent or knowledge is horrific,"" the American rock band R.E.M. said in a statement posted on CloseGitmoNow.org. ""It's anti-American, period."" Several former Guantanamo detainees have filed lawsuits against the U.S. government, saying they were tortured with numerous techniques, including loud music. ""It's very scary to think that you might go crazy because of the music, because of the loud noise,"" said Ruhal Ahmed, one of the former detainees who has filed a lawsuit. He said he had to listen to hours of headbanging music while held prisoner at Guantanamo in 2003. The Pentagon has not responded directly to the allegations of torture involving music, but it has said that its policy has always been to treat detainees humanely. Loud music has not been used at Guantanamo since the fall of 2003, following a Department of Defense review of detention operations and interrogation techniques, according to Maj. Diana Haynie, a Joint Task Force Guantanamo spokeswoman. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has asked a federal prosecutor to examine whether the interrogations violated the law, and the White House said Obama will leave any decision on charges to the Justice Department. And the Obama administration announced it would put the FBI in charge of a special unit set up to question suspected terrorists under White House oversight.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- People in big cities walk past them every day -- street performers, or buskers. Some are talented, some are not, and most aren't performing for a cause greater than themselves. But on Monday, 12-year-old Abby Miller was. Abby Miller sings for her friend Taylor Love outside Washington's Union Station on Monday. She was performing outside Washington's Union Station to help her 4-year-old friend, Taylor Love, who is suffering from cancer. Abby sat in front of the station with a couple of her friends, singing songs and strumming a guitar. Passers-by seemed to notice the girl's singing talent, stopping to listen in the chilly weather, with a few putting money in a bucket at Abby's feet. Abby said the money will help support Taylor's family. A few more stopped to write messages on ""Love Notes,"" little cards designed to encourage Taylor Love through the tough time. ""Her mom reads them to her before she goes to bed at night,"" Abby said. ""Taylor gets excited for them and she loves getting them read to her because she likes knowing that people are supporting her and people are actually thinking of her."" Taylor has neuroblastoma, a cancer that affects the nervous system. According to her Web site, she is in remission, but this type of cancer has a high risk of recurrence. There has been little research on the illness, of which there are about 650 new cases in the United States each year. Mike Gillette, a family friend of both Taylor and Abby, brought the two girls together. While raising money and support for Taylor is important, he said, he thinks Abby's outreach can help bring more critical awareness for the devastating disease. ""She really wanted to reach people all over the country,"" he said. Gillette said he has taken Abby to do similar performances in the District of Columbia, New Jersey and Virginia, and estimates they've raised thousands of dollars and have gotten people to write several hundred ""Love Notes."" Abby does more than just raise money and awareness for her friend. Taylor's mother, Aimee, said that although Abby is eight years older than Taylor, the two see each other often and have a special connection that helps her get through her daughter's illness. ""I think it's amazing for a 12-year-old Abby to be drawn to my daughter, who is 4 and wants to inspire other children,"" Aimee Love said. ""The joy I see in Taylor when she sees Abby brings a light into my life."" Taylor's family said her treatments are terribly painful. But Abby said Taylor has enormous character. ""She's the most happy girl in the world, which I think is just incredible,"" Abby said. ""She's so much fun to be around. She's a little 4-year-old girl but she's got a heart of like a thousand grown adults."" Aimee Love said her daughter feels the same way about Abby.

"PITTSBURGH, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Leaders of the G-20 economic summit will announce Friday that the group will become the new permanent council for international economic cooperation, senior U.S. officials told CNN Thursday. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner says signs of optimism for a global economic recovery can be seen. The move comes in the wake of a major push by President Obama, the officials said. The G-20 will now essentially eclipse the G-8, which will continue to meet on major security issues but carry much less influence. ""It's a reflection of the world economy today and the players that make it up,"" said one senior official. Nations like China, Brazil and India -- which were locked out of the more elite G-8 -- will be part of the larger group. The Group of 20 -- leaders of 20 countries representing 90 percent of the world's economic output -- are meeting in Pittsburgh for a two-day summit, focusing on the financial crisis and how to avoid a future repeat. The gathering is Obama's first time hosting a major international summit. ""We're meeting at a time where, for the first time since London, certainly for the first time in a year, we're seeing the first signs of optimism about prospects for global recovery,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told reporters Thursday. ""I think the broad consensus of private economists and businesses are that we're beginning to see growth in the United States, and around the world we see exports rising and forecasts for growth are being revised upwards."" ""This is encouraging,"" he said, ""but we have a ways to go."" He said the leaders are ""going to keep working to sustain the progress we've seen. And I can say with confidence, based on my discussions with finance ministers and central bank governors from around the world, there is a common, shared commitment to make sure we're working together to sustain these early signs of recovery and growth."" One of the key goals is preventing such a crisis from occurring in the future, he said. ""In the run-up to this crisis, many of the world's largest economies depended on the American consumer to buy their exports to drive growth, and we made it easy; for too long, Americans were buying too much and saving too little,"" Geithner said. ""And that's no longer an option for us or for the rest of the world. And already in the United States you can see the first signs of an important transformation here as Americans save more and as we borrow substantially less from the rest of the world."" ""I think we all recognize that we need to act before the memory of the crisis fades and before the impetus for reform recedes,"" he said. ""And we're trying to bring greater urgency and commitment to the need to act together."" The tightening of global financial regulations was expected to top the summit's agenda and comes as some major economies are beginning to recover. Germany, France and Japan have announced that they have emerged from recession, prompting hopes that the worst of the financial crisis may have passed. G-20 finance ministers and central bank governors agreed at a meeting this month not to start cutting back just yet on stimulus efforts. They fear it would put economies at risk for plunging back into recession. However, the economic outlook has improved enough that countries are being encouraged to start working on exit strategies, which will vary by nation. The economic summit marks the third time in a year that the world's top industrial powers have gathered. They met in November in Washington and followed up with an April session in London. A number of protesters gathered in the area, tracked by police. At one point, riot police used pepper spray or tear gas on the protesters. CNN's Brian Todd was one of the people affected by the spray or gas.  See iReport photos of police and protesters Â» . ""It really drove the protesters back,"" Todd said. ""It drove us back. It burned our eyes. It really burned our throats for a while. It got pretty dicey there.""  Watch Todd's report Â» . After that, Todd said, the protesters dispersed somewhat, but police were keeping an eye on the remaining protesters. iReport.com: Pittsburgh braces for protests . Among the protesters was a group of several hundred wearing T-shirts reading, ""G20: Free Tibet Before Free Trade."" The crowd marched about eight blocks before police blocked their path. Officers allowed the protesters to chant in the street for more than an hour before they walked away. There were no arrests. Others chanted pro-marijuana slogans behind the riot police, and another group took up the stadium chant of ""Let's go Steelers.""

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- Drawing on 2006 remarks in which he compared former U.S. President George Bush to the devil, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, speaking at the United Nations Thursday, said, ""It doesn't smell like sulfur anymore."" Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez spoke highly of President Obama at the United Nations on Thursday. In a rambling speech at the U.N. General Assembly, Chavez spoke highly of current President Obama, saying he is an ""intelligent man"" and comparing him to President John F. Kennedy. ""I hope God will protect Obama from the bullets that killed Kennedy,"" he said. ""I hope Obama will be able to look and see, genuinely see, what has to be seen and bring about a change."" Three years ago, Chavez spoke at the gathering the day after Bush spoke, and said the lectern ""still smells of sulfur."" But on Thursday he looked around the podium and said, ""It doesn't smell of sulfur. It's gone. No, it smells of something else. It smells of hope."" He did, however, criticize some U.S. policies, questioning whether there are ""two Obamas.""  Watch Chavez speak at the U.N. General Assembly Â» . Chavez accused the Pentagon of being behind the ousting of Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya in a military-backed coup in June. ""American soldiers knew about the coup and supported it,"" he said. ""Hence the contradiction that Obama has to face. Are there two Obamas? Obama spoke here yesterday. Does he have a double? ... Let's hope the one we heard yesterday will prevail. Let us hope. That's what the world needs."" The United States and Brazil have said they support dialogue between Zelaya and de facto President Roberto Micheletti, centered on the San Jose Accord brought about through the mediation of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias and the Organization of American States mission. That deal calls for Zelaya to be restored to office. ""The U.S. government, and this is strange, has not recognized the fact that a military coup d'etat has occurred,"" Chavez said. ""There is some friction between the State Department and the Pentagon."" He said the coup was engineered by the Honduran bourgeoisie, ""four or five wealthy, powerful families."" Chavez also called for the United States to lift what he called the ""savage, murderous blockade"" on Cuba, and was critical of plans to open U.S. military bases in Colombia, saying what the nation needs instead is aid to lift itself out of its civil war. In addition, Chavez criticized capitalism and extolled the virtues of socialism, saying it is ""the road to salvation for this planet."" He spoke for almost exactly an hour, less than the hour and 36 minutes Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi used on Wednesday. The Venezuelan president joked that he would not speak as long as Gadhafi, but said he planned to speak as long as Obama. Asked to expand on his ""two Obamas"" comment at a news conference after his speech, Chavez said, ""I think that one of the serious failures of the United States has been that, for a long time, it has underestimated and undervalued Latin America and the Caribbean. ... I hope that Obama turns around the vision of the White House and the Department of State of Latin America. They cannot continue to mistreat us."" He said one Obama spoke about peace in addressing the General Assembly, yet has seven U.S. military bases in Colombia. ""There's a double somewhere,"" he said. Asked by a reporter about the closures of television stations in Venezuela, Chavez said it was ""a big lie"" and asked her to provide an example. She asked about RCT, or Radio Caracas Television. Chavez told her the station broadcasts every day, but that a contract, or concession, had expired for its ""open signal"" and was not renewed. ""Never in Venezuela do we have as much freedom of expression as we do now,"" he said. But, he asked, ""What would happen here in the United States if CNN and other stations supported a coup? Not only would they be shut down, but their owners would have been taken to the electric chair.""","Three years ago, Chavez said it ""still smells of sulfur,"" referring to President Bush .

"(CNET) -- A post on the Facebook developer blog announces the big application program interface (API) update from the social network that was first reported on Sunday night, which it's calling the Open Stream API. The ""Open Stream API"" was front-and-center with Facebook's controversial redesign earlier this year. It's the first major implementation of an emerging (read: brand new) open standard called Activity Streams, on which Facebook has been collaborating with developers for the past few months. Basically, what it means is that third-party developers will have access to a feed of all content posted to news feeds--notes, photos, videos, links, ""likes"" and comments, and activity from other applications built on the social network's platform. ""We've officially moved away from the Web of just blog posts, which a lot of these formats were originally designed for,"" said open-source developer and advocate Chris Messina, who has been spearheading the development of Activity Streams for about a year now. ""Over time, what I think will happen is (that) you'll see something toward the type of cleverness and ingenuity that has surfaced around the Twitter community, but in a way that is even more expressive and rich,"" Messina said. ""In the case of Twitter, you're just talking about status updates; in the case of Facebook you're talking about a lot of different activities."" Previously, only status updates--the most Twitter-like part of Facebook--were accessible to developers. That's why this announcement likely makes the biggest difference to the creators of social feed aggregation applications like TweetDeck and Seesmic Desktop. But because Activity Streams is an open standard, other social-networking and media-sharing applications will be able to use it too. This means that there could be, say, an Adobe Air-based desktop application that brings in updates across photo-sharing applications like Facebook, Flickr, and Photobucket. Facebook is also targeting different types of developers -- specifically mobile and desktop -- rather than strictly the Web app developers whose creations made Facebook's platform such a wild success when it debuted two years ago. ""One of the most important stories to tell here is this is the first time that we've ever opened the core Facebook product experience, which was previously called the 'feed' and which we're now calling the 'stream,'"" Facebook senior platform manager Dave Morin explained to CNET News. ""We're especially excited to see the types of desktop applications and the types of mobile applications which developer are going to build for the stream. We've sort of never really allowed this before, so we're pretty excited to see what developers come up with."" Facebook will be holding an event on Monday afternoon in Palo Alto, California, to introduce developers to the new API. Presenting at the event will be representatives from Adobe, which is building a Facebook application in its Air runtime environment, and Microsoft, which is doing the same in Silverlight; contact management system Plaxo and third-party app Seesmic Desktop (which already has unveiled its support for the Open Stream) are also presenting. The ""stream"" took front-and-center with Facebook's controversial redesign earlier this year. Inspired by the likes of Twitter, the revamped design marked a shift in strategy for Facebook from static profiles to a real-time flow of information. At the same time, it proved unpopular among some users. But Facebook isn't the only big social-networking player to be implementing Activity Streams. The emerging standard was behind the upgrades to MySpace's MySpaceID product that the News Corp.-owned service launched in March at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival. ""It was sort of one of the earlier opportunities we had to take a nascent spec and see it all the way through to launch,"" MySpaceID product lead Max Engel told CNET News, adding that his team first started working on Activity Streams last September. It's what powers a new MySpace ""gadget"" for Google as well as its feeds' presence on the upcoming Yahoo homepage redesign. ""It's getting where we need it to be, which is like e-mail: where you can write a POP client and know (that) it works,"" Engel said. ""It's not even a full standard yet, so it's sort of exciting to see so many people get behind something so quickly, and it's definitely indicative of the general momentum of people who are saying we'd rather work open than work closed.""

"(CNN) -- The first nine months of this year has seen more pirate attacks than all of last year. And more than half of those attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates, an international maritime watchdog group said Wednesday. The increase in attacks has forced many countries to patrol pirate hotspots such as the Gulf of Aden. ""The increased activity in Somalia is the major reason for the spike,"" said Cyrus Mody, manager of the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors shipping crimes. From January 1 until September 30, pirates worldwide mounted 306 attacks, compared with 293 in all of 2008, the Bureau said. Of the incidents this year, Somali pirates accounted for 54 percent: they launched 168 attacks. Most of them took place off the east coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, a major shipping route between Yemen and Somalia. They successfully hijacked 32 vessels and took 533 hostages. Eight others were wounded, four more killed and one is missing, the Bureau said. Somali pirates are still holding four ships for ransom with 80 crew members as hostages. Somalia's transitional government, which has a tenuous grip on power, has been unable to stop the pirates -- many of whom are based in the port cities. This has prompted Europe and other Western countries to step up maritime patrols. ""In the Gulf of Aden, the number of attacks have gone up. But because of the presence of naval vessels, the success rate of the pirates have decreased,"" Mody said. ""The navies are responding very very effectively."" Today's pirates are a far cry from the eye-patched, peg-legged swashbucklers of Hollywood. They don night-vision goggles, carry rocket launchers and navigate with global positioning devices. Many pirates are trained fighters; others are young thugs enlisted for the job. Experts say they often sail out to sea in a mother ship and wait for a target. When they find one, the pirates board smaller boats and move in, typically with five to seven armed hijackers per boat. Two recent trends have led to a rise in piracy: access and opportunity. As global commerce picks up, more and more of the world's fuels, minerals and other crucial commodities travel by ship. Ninety-five percent of America's foreign trade, for instance, moves by water, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. That cargo is an easy target for robbers in countries that lack the resources to secure their shorelines, such as Somalia. Those who have tracked pirate activity say it started in Somalia in the 1980s, when the pirates claimed they were aiming to stop the rampant illegal fishing and dumping that continues to this day off the Somali coast. Piracy accelerated after the fall of the Somali government in the early 1990s and began to flourish after shipping companies started paying ransoms. Those payments started out being in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions. With the ransoms they collect, pirates can earn up to $40,000 a year, analysts say. That's a fortune for someone from an impoverished country. Some analysts say companies are simply making the problem worse by paying the piracies. ""Yes, the ransoms have probably caused the piracy to become a bit more rampant. But at the same time, from the owner's point of view, there is no other way currently to secure the safe release of the vessel along with the crew and the cargo,"" Mody said. ""It's basically a cycle."" Other trouble spots this year were waters off Nigeria, with 20 attacks; Malaysia with 14; and Bangladesh with 12.","Somali pirates accounted for 54 percent of all attacks this year .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Why would an award-winning singer, songwriter, producer and single mother want to tack reality TV star onto her long list of accomplishments? Kandi Burruss says she is happy to join the ""Real Housewives of Atlanta"" cast. For Kandi Burruss, the newest member of the Real Housewives of Atlanta, the answer is simple: ""I was a fan last year. I love the show."" The second season of Bravo's hit show is set to premier on Thursday with Burruss replacing cast member DeShawn Snow. Burruss is well-known in the music industry as a former member of the platinum-selling R&B girl group Xscape and co-writer of such hits as Destiny's Child's ""Bills, Bills, Bills"" and TLC's ""No Scrubs,"" for which she won a Grammy. The Atlanta native almost ended up on another reality show with former group mate and writing partner Tameka ""Tiny"" Cottle, who is the fiancÃ©e of rapper T.I. and now stars on BET's ""Tiny & Toya"" alongside Antonia ""Toya"" Carter, the ex-wife of Lil' Wayne. The deal for that show didn't work out and Burruss said she was more than happy to sign on with Bravo's wildly successful southern edition of the ""Housewives"" franchise, which chronicles the lives of a group of affluent African-American women in the ATL. Burruss was already friendly with cast mate Lisa Wu Hartwell, whom she met through their mutual friend Cottle. Having watched the show -- which last season enraptured viewers with a mix of constant infighting, lavish lifestyles and a healthy dose of drama -- Burruss said she was more concerned with being thrust into the public eye than she was with getting along with the cast. ""The only thing that made me hesitant about wanting to be a part of the show is the fact that people are so critical of the show,"" she said. ""Just dealing with people on the outside judging you. That part is going to be something that I am going to have to get used to."" The artist has already had to get acclimated to people smearing her personal life on the Internet.  Watch Burruss discuss her time on the show Â» . Newly engaged to a father of six children, Burruss has watched him get attacked in blogs and is protective of the man who she said even her mother isn't thrilled about her marrying. ""[The show] has been very, very stressful on the relationship,"" she said. ""I guess [people] couldn't find anything bad [to say] about me, so they wanted to go in on my fiancÃ©."" Her caring nature and laid-back personality make Burruss special in the industry, said rapper Rick Ross. ""She's a very humble person, maybe one of the most humble people among the biggest songwriters in the industry,"" said Ross, who collaborated with Burruss on a track for a new solo album she has in the works. ""It's good to be around the greats and she most definitely is one of the greatest in the industry."" Her home music studio attests to that. The walls are covered with gold and platinum records for her work with several high-profile artists including Alicia Keys, *NSYNC, Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Being part of a girl group helped prepare her for the drama of dealing with the other housewives' personalities, Burruss said, though she admitted clashing with outspoken cast mate NeNe Leakes during filming. ""I was a fan of hers last year,"" Burruss said. ""All that wild and crazy stuff she says to people, when you're watching it, it's funny, it's hilarious... but when it's directed at you, it's not funny anymore."" Burruss got along better with aspiring singer Kim Zolciak, who Burruss will assist in achieving her dream of breaking into the industry. Last season, fans of the show -- and some of the other housewives -- slammed Zolciak for her less-than-stellar voice. ""Everybody loves to hate on Kim. But what I have to say is that Kim is actually cooler in person than she came off on the show,"" said Burruss, who in 1999 won top songwriter of the year from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. ""I wanted to help her out because I love helping the underdog."" The busy artist said she has no idea if she will be invited back for another season. Appearing on the show, which Burruss said is not scripted, was fun, but she is busy with an upcoming album and with caring for her daughter, Riley, she said. She doubts she will be addicted to appearing on reality TV like she is addicted to music, Burruss said. ""It's just another way for people to get to know you and hopefully they see me in a good light,"" she said. ""You always hope that it doesn't backfire.""","Kandi Burruss is the newest member of Bravo's ""Real Housewives of Atlanta""

"(CNN) -- The guitarist stands in front of a mirror messing with his mohawk. The drummer strikes a wild tempo. The singer rips off his T-shirt and begins to scream the lyrics. Basim Usmani is bassist for The Kominas, a group that blends traditional sounds with punk rock beats. They're young. They're punk. And they're rocking both their Muslim and American worlds with their music, lyrics and style. ""A lot of times people say, 'Oh wow, look, brown people playing music' [but] it's more than that,"" said 25-year-old Pakistani-American Shahjehan Khan, the lead singer for a Muslim punk band, The Kominas. The Boston-based band is one of a handful of Muslim punk bands that emerged in the United States in the past few years. The members of this four-person rock group with South Asian roots hold varying views on religion. One says he's an atheist; three others identify as Muslims -- both practicing and non-practicing. For them, punk music is a way to rebel against their conservative cultural upbringing and the frustrations of growing up a young Muslim in America. ""We aren't [just] some alternative to a stereotypical Muslim. We actually might be offering some sort of insights for people at large about religion, about the world,"" said 26-year-old bassist Basim Usmani. Blending traditional South Asian rhythms with punk rock beats, they sing in both English and Punjabi. (Kominas means ""scum-bag"" in Punjabi, according to the band.) Their songs can be at once political, serious, satirical and insinuating.  Audio slide show: On tour with Muslim punk rockers Â» . Their risquÃ© lyrics and provocative song titles such as ""Sharia Law in the USA,"" ""Suicide Bomb the GAP"" and ""Rumi was a Homo"" -- a protest song against homophobia in the American Muslim community -- have drawn the attention of Muslims, non-Muslims, fans and critics alike. ""You sort of have to throw it in peoples' faces and be shocking in order to give people a different way to think about stuff,"" said Usmani. ""These punk, metal and rap scenes - so-called extreme music scenes -- are addressing issues that mainstream music doesn't,"" said Mark LeVine, a professor of Middle Eastern history at University of California, Irvine, who is also a musician and author of ""Heavy Metal Islam."" ""[Punk] allows them to rebel against society and their own culture at the same time,"" he said. iReport: Is Islam at odds with American values? Before the Islamic punk movement in North America had a voice, it had a story. The Muslim punk scene began to gel in 2003 when novelist and convert to Islam, Michael Muhammad Knight self-published his book, ""The Taqwacores"" about a fictional Muslim punk scene in Buffalo, New York. The book opens with a poem called ""Muhammed was a Punk Rocker"" and describes both conventional and unconventional characters including a Shi'ite skinhead, a conservative Sunni Muslim, a burka-wearing feminist punk and a Sufi who sports a Mohawk and drinks alcohol. ""The punk rock kids I would hang out with weren't even Muslim,"" 31-year old Knight recalls. ""They were so fiercely individualistic -- I wish that I could be a Muslim in that way: not be ashamed of my confusion, not be ashamed of my doubts. Just be myself and be proud of who I am."" The novel's title, ""Taqwacore,"" is a hybrid word stemming from the Arabic ""taqwa,"" meaning ""god consciousness,"" and ""core"" referring to ""hardcore"" -- a genre of punk music. It's now a general term for Muslim punk rock. The popularity of the book, which Knight said was born out of a search to find his identity as a Muslim-American, grew in underground youth circles and online. It didn't take long before real-life ""taqwacore"" bands like The Kominas began blooming across the country. ""It makes sense why punk has been the music of choice for young, politically active Muslims who are musical,"" said LeVine. ""The straight edge movement in punk which was about no drugs, no alcohol, was clean yet very intense and political. It's a way for them to rebel against their families in some extreme ways yet still be ritualistically, 'good Muslims.' "" ""Taqwacore"" gave voice to many young Muslim-Americans who felt muted by circumstances and created an opening for bands like Al-Thawra, Vote Hezbollah, and Secret Trial Five -- an all-girl punk band out of Vancouver, Canada. In the summer of 2007, five of the taqwacore bands organized a ""taqwa-tour"" of the northeastern United States. They played in city after city, traveling in a green school bus with TAQWA painted on the front bought by Knight for $2,000 on eBay. This summer, The Kominas continue to strike a chord with audiences around the country, hitting cities from San Francisco to New York on a multi-city tour. The taqwacore movement has also inspired two upcoming films - a dramatic feature film based on the book and a documentary. Many conservative Muslims may peg young taqwacores as heretic for their suggestive and irreverent lyrics. But the musicians say they are just trying to show both cultures how broad the spectrum of belief can be. Like many young adults balancing their religious beliefs with American culture, some young Muslims in the United States say it's a constant struggle to be accepted in both worlds. ""I had a lot of conflicted feelings growing up a Muslim in America,"" said 25-year-old Kominas drummer Imran Malik. ""It was hard not being able to do the same things that everyone else around you is doing without feeling guilty about them."" Knight, who grew up with a Catholic mother and white supremacist father, converted to Islam when he was 16. He said his message is not one of blasphemy but rather an extension of his discontent with the rigid etiquette that dictates certain practices within Islam and the stereotypes of Muslims in American. ""Muslims haven't been fully accepted as Americans but the American experience hasn't been accepted as something that can contribute to the Muslim world,"" said Knight. Knight said writing the book helped him and others connect through shared experiences. ""When I first wrote it, I felt like there would never be a place for me in the Muslim community and that has really turned around a lot,"" he said. ""The book gave me the community I needed, it connected me to all these kids that were also confused and who also went through the things that I went through."" That connection is vital to taqwacore music, bassist Usmani said. ""The music is great, but the conversation is the key to all of this. The dialogue that we have inspired is really invaluable."" ""I don't think Islam is ever going to go away, I'm just trying to see how it best fits in my life.""","A handful of Muslim punk bands have emerged in the last few years .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- The number of dead in devastating floods triggered by torrential rains in India has risen to at least 271, and about a million people have fled their homes, officials said Monday. An aerial view of a flood-affected area in Bijapur district in North Karnataka, India. At least 192 people have died in the southern state of Karnataka, its disaster-management secretary H.V. Parshwanath told CNN. More than 450,000 people there have been housed in 1,330 relief camps as authorities completed rescue operations in most of the flooded zones in the state, he said. ""The focus is now mainly on relief,"" Parshwanath said, adding that rains have now eased in Karnataka. In neighboring Andhra Pradesh, authorities put the death toll at 51. Some 531,000 people have been evacuated to safety, with more half of them now sheltering in relief camps, said Dinesh Kumar, the commissioner of the state's disaster-monitoring department. India has deployed the military to help with relief and rescue in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. More than a dozen teams of naval divers have been sent to the two flood-hit states, the country's defense ministry said. Air force planes and helicopters have also been dropping food packets in the submerged regions. The military has been able to rescue 1,336 people so far, it added. Flood waters were now receding in two of the five worst hit districts of Andhra Pradesh, disaster official Kumar said. But floodwaters from a local river might submerge the remaining three, he warned. Flooding also killed at least 25 people in Maharashtra state, officials said. Three others died because of lightning strikes, said S.C. Mohanty, director of Maharashtra's disaster-management department. About 3,000 people have been displaced because of flooding, he told CNN. Thousands of people die each year in India during seasonal monsoon rains. More than 1,100 had been killed in monsoon-triggered flooding in different parts of the country as of last month, according to the disaster-management division of the federal home ministry.","Death toll from floods in India has now reached 271 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A brain surgeon performed what he called a ""life-saving"" surgery on a teenager by removing a large brain tumor using a method he read about on CNN.com just three days earlier. Dr. Thomas Ellis is a senior neurosurgeon at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. Dr. Thomas Ellis, a senior neurosurgeon at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina, the United States, said he had become ""very demoralized"" after an unsuccessful six-hour operation to remove a tumor from a 19-year-old named Brandon. ""I had had to give the boy's mother the bad news and that is not something I am used to. She was crying and it was very hard. Your story truly came at the perfect time,"" Ellis said. ""I am inclined to believe that it is the work of God that I came across your article that very night,"" the surgeon told CNN. The article was about the ""Omni directional dielectric mirror,"" a pen-shaped fiber-optic tool that allows surgeons to carry out minimally invasive surgery on areas too difficult or delicate to access. That night, Ellis contacted the neurosurgeon quoted in the story who put him in touch with Omni Guide, the Boston, Massachusetts-based company that manufactures the handheld device. It was originally devised for the U.S. military, and rolled out for surgeries three months before Ellis read about it. The tool allows surgeons to easily manipulate a CO2 laser and bend it to reach almost any tissue in the body, particularly in cases where scalpels may pose a danger. ""Seventy-two hours later I held the device in my hands,"" Ellis explained. ""Omni Guide sent someone to do a demo. I was extremely impressed and excited and very quickly I pretty much got the hang of it."" Ellis added: ""I think it's an amazing story because it's yet another demonstration of how interconnected we've become in this world. ""You have a CNN reporter in London, who writes a story about a neurosurgeon in Chicago, who's using a device that was invented in Massachusetts. That story is read by a different neurosurgeon in North Carolina, and all within 72 hours, we have the device in North Carolina. ""We have the patient lined up for a surgery, and in the span of just a few days we perform really a life-saving operation on this patient."" Ellis first met Brandon on December 17, 2008, when his mother took him to the emergency department at Wake Forest Hospital suffering from what Ellis calls, ""an extremely rapid decline in basic functions."" ""While he had been suffering from minor symptoms for about a year, he suddenly acquired terrible headaches and became very confused."" Ellis ordered an immediate MRI scan of Brandon's skull and found an extremely large tumor, known as a teratoma, in the middle of his brain. Read an explainer about teratomas . He operated two days later, but despite spending six hours in the operating room and going through half a dozen scalpels, he only managed to remove 20 percent of the tumor. ""In 15 years of doing neurosurgery, it really was the most difficult tumor that I ever encountered. It was very rubbery and hard to debulk,"" he said. ""I wish I could demonstrate the firmness of the tumor that we were dealing with but it really was the case that after trying to dissect the tumor just five minutes with each scalpel,  the scalpel would be dull and I would have to move on to use another scalpel. ""I went through at least a half-dozen of them, and even after many, many hours of operating on this tumor with multiple scalpels with multiple microsurgical-dissecting tools, I couldn't remove very much of this tumor."" Ellis advised the boy's mother, Tania, who asked we only give her first name, that her son would have to go through radiation treatment. Unlike chemotherapy, which involves the use of anticancer drugs, radiation treatment employs high-energy rays and particles to kill cancer cells. ""Radiation therapy is a difficult process, especially for such a large tumor,"" Ellis said. He explained that he was feeling despondent about the patient's condition when he got home after the operation that night. ""Being the father of four children myself, just the thought of having to go through something like this with one of my own children is just beyond words,"" he said. ""As I do every night, I read CNN online and immediately saw on the front page that there was an article in the health section entitled, From military device to life-saving surgical tool. ... Read the original CNN.com story . ""I finished the rest of the story and my first thought was: I would have given anything to have this tool available six or seven hours ago  based on the description in the story. ""Lasers have long been abandoned in neurosurgery,"" he said, ""because they were too cumbersome to use. But CNN spoke of a brain operation performed by a Dr. Bernard Bendok in Chicago with CO2 laser and this new easy-to-use, perfect mirror tool."" The following day, on Christmas Eve, Ellis along with Dr. Tamir Wolf, a physician OmniGuide sent to assist, brought Brandon back to the operating room. ""After only 30 minutes, it was clear this laser device, as simple to use as a scalpel, was successfully debulking the tumor."" Ellis operated on Brandon for four hours and managed to remove the remaining 80 percent of the tumor by vaporizing it from the inside with the laser and then excising it. ""The boy was then extubated [removing the tube to his airway] after about 30 minutes and that same evening he was eating normally,"" Wolf said. Brandon has recovered his basic functions and is behaving normally. ""I am very optimistic and so is his mother, although we still have to be careful and do regular check-ups to look for possible spreading of the tumor,"" Ellis said. He believes that ""at the least, this device will become a valuable new tool for surgeons. But it may actually usher in a new generation of neurosurgeons who do microsurgery very differently."" ""Either way, this type of success story is what we neurosurgeons live for.""","Surgeon unsuccessfully attempts to remove patient's brain tumor .

""We can't have our reviewer be stoned all the time,"" he quipped. But, he said, the ideal applicant should have ""the ability to write and be in the position of holding a state medical marijuana card."" The reviewer, he said, should know his or her way around dispensaries and be ""passionate about the issue of medical marijuana."" Colorado is one of 14 states where medical marijuana is legal by state law -- federal law still bans its use. But this week, the Obama administration announced a new policy loosening the rules regarding prosecuting criminal activity associated with medical marijuana. The Justice Department now says that prosecutors can go after traffickers but not medical marijuana patients and their caregivers. Though Westword is no longer accepting applicants for its dispensary reviewer position, they are actively working through the 120 they received and have culled the list down to under 20. The applicants run the gamut of 20-something stoners to well-educated engineers in their 50s. Some have even offered to work for free, Tone said, adding ""We won't accept that.""

"(CNN) -- Energetic, infectious and combative, the music of Nigerian musician Femi Kuti has moved audiences around the world. But the man is just as passionate about getting people to change their world as much as move their feet. Son of Afrobeat pioneer and political activist Fela Kuti, Femi inherited his father's zeal for both music and activism. Kuti was signed to Motown Records in 1994 and his music blends Afrobeat with more current soul, R&B and jazz. He's worked with rappers Mos Def and Common and continues to explore his music and collaborations. While the music matters, the man himself remains just as politically motivated as his father. Kuti's nightclub in Lagos, the New Afrika Shrine, had become a Mecca for West African music and creative expression, until it was closed by the authorities earlier in the summer. It was also homage to his father and continued his legacy of using music to inspire, change and motivate. Kuti recently told a reporter for All Africa Global Media that the Shrine was a place of worship where people can honor ""great black people, who fought for the emancipation of Africa through music."" Freeing the ""Shrine"" from being under lock and key is just one of his crusading missions, as with his band, The Positive Force, Kuti remains outspoken about Nigeria, corruption and the positive changes that Africa can achieve.

"(CNN)  -- A new smartphone application allows users to carry out a virtual dissection of a human body. The iPhone app, ""Anatomy Lab,"" allows the user to move between 40 body layers to enable dissection. The iPhone app, called ""Anatomy Lab,"" has been developed by researchers from the University of Utah and provides images of a real human cadaver. Utah professor Mark Nielsen told CNN that the application is aimed at medical and anatomy students who might not have the opportunity to dissect a real human body, but it's also proving a hit with medical practitioners. ""A lot of medical professionals, especially in physical therapy and rehabilitative medicine, are using it to educate patients and show them the body parts they're discussing,"" Nielsen told CNN. ""Anatomy Lab"" lets the user move between 40 separate body layers, zoom in to view different structures and rotate them to get different view points. It started out as a computer program showing the dissection of a cadaver, beginning with the skin and moving on to subcutaneous tissue, nerves, veins, and muscles.  See some of the best health monitoring apps Â» . Nielsen said the iPhone's touch screen is perfect for the interactive nature of the application. ""The program's so logically set up for the iPhone -- you can pinch the screen to rotate and enlarge, and tap on things to identify them,"" he said. Nielsen's son, Scott Nielsen, a physics major at the University of Utah, wrote the code for the iPhone version, which has so far sold more than 3,000 copies.

"(CNN) -- A call for Smurfs brought together 1,253 dressed-up-in-blue people in County Monaghan, Ireland. A 4,703-pound cheesecake rolled out in Mexico City. A 7-year-old Michigan boy made a ball of plastic wrap that's 11 feet across. Anthony Victor of India has hair measuring 7.12 inches sprouting from the center of his outer ears. Meanwhile, in Ellensburg, Washington, 13-year-old Brenden Adams is having a hard time fitting into cars. At 7 feet 4.6 inches, Adams -- who as a kindergartner was taller than his teacher -- has made it into the Guinness World Records 2010 book, released Thursday, as the tallest teenage boy. It's a stature he said was earned simply because his 12th chromosome split in half. And while the height has its perks -- ""You don't get picked on as much""  -- he wishes strangers wouldn't stare. ""I'm another person, just like everybody else,"" said Adams, who doesn't play basketball -- two knee replacements insured that -- and prefers to hang out with friends, camp and ride dirt bikes. The tallest teenage boy is one of about 4,000 records listed in this year's book -- a number that accounts for a mere 10 percent of all the mind-blowing stats that make up the Guinness World Records database, said Stuart Claxton, a spokesman for the organization that began publishing feats in 1955.

From the obscure (Most balloons inflated with a nose? 308) to the old standbys (Lucia Zarate, who died in 1890, still holds the record for lightest adult at 4.7 pounds), it's the reference-book gift that keeps on giving. So why would someone set out to spend the most time in a bumper car (record: 24 hours), or solve the most Rubik's Cubes in one hour (record: 185)? ""It's an innate part of our psyche as human beings to explore how far we can push the boundaries,"" said Claxton, who's been with Guinness World Records since 2000.

""I told him, 'We'll get a bunch of books, and we'll see if there's anything we can do,' "" she said. Building a ball of plastic wrap was where they landed. And what started with a softball-sized ball grew and grew and grew into a 281-pound monstrosity, earning Lonsway, now 9, a spot in this year's record book. ""It does take up a nice corner of the garage,"" Grames said with a laugh. And when people comment on how ""cool"" it is, she said her husband's response is always the same: ""You want it? Take it."" iReport.com: Massive chess board with human pieces . Claxton, of Guinness, has seen everything from the innocuous to the extreme and dangerous.

Some images might be hard to take in at first. ""Over 1,000 piercings in the human body is something you have to get used to looking at,"" Claxton said. And while the most tattooed man -- 99 percent of his body is covered -- ""may not be my cup of tea,"" he said that when it comes to categories there's something for everyone. Lee Redmond, 68, of Salt Lake City, Utah, earned the top berth for longest fingernails after not cutting them from 1979 onward. As of the last record-setting measurement, her nails were 28-foot long in total, the longest being her left index fingernail that came in at 3-foot, Claxton said. But a car accident in February of this year left her nails broken and her hands much freer, the Guinness spokesman said. iReport.com: World's largest rocking chair?

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- A lot of people have been outraged by the gender verification testing that South African athlete Caster Semenya has been put through, and have been trying to be supportive of her; but in doing so, they often further prejudice against the very thing which she appears to be: intersex. Hida Viloria says she looks forward to a day when intersex conditions like hers are widely accepted. Intersex people (formerly known as hermaphrodites) are those born with bodies that are difficult to classify as either ""male"" or ""female."" Since results of Semenya's tests were apparently leaked, it seems that her body doesn't conform to the definition of ""female"" as one who has ovaries. I'm intersex because, while I have ovaries, menstruate and can get pregnant, my genitalia is somewhat male-looking (simply put, I have a clitoris that's much larger than average.) Throughout my childhood, I never thought I was anything other than ""female"" because that's what I was labeled and raised as. While I felt more aggressive than other girls, I didn't think that anything other than male and female could exist. So I just thought of myself as a ""different kind of woman."" Ultimately, my assessment was pretty accurate. I was raised in a strict Catholic home, where nudity and sex talk was unheard of, so having no one to compare my genitals to, I was unaware that mine were different. I'm very lucky to have escaped the ""corrective"" surgeries and/or hormone treatments that are the norm for intersex infants, because my father went to medical school before these practices began (in the mid-late '50's), and knew that you shouldn't operate on a baby unless it's absolutely necessary. Later, when he wanted to give me estrogen pills at puberty to ensure that my body ""feminized"" (he told me that the pills were to make me grow taller), my mother objected, saying it was experimental and that I didn't need it. Thankfully, she won out. Thus, no one ever told me there was anything wrong with my body (that didn't happen until a gynecological visit when I was twenty), and I grew up loving it just the way it is. I still do. While many doctors would refer to my clitoris as ""grossly enlarged,"" I have to tell you, having an overabundance of the only organ in the human body whose sole purpose is pleasure is far from a negative thing! I came of age sexually with my second boyfriend in high school. I broke up with him because I knew that I preferred girls, but I couldn't act on it yet. Once I did, in college, it confirmed that girls were what I'd always longed for, and it was then that I realized how much my body differed from theirs.' Still, I had no name for my difference. At the age of twenty-six, I finally discovered I was ""intersex"" from a newspaper article. Fortunately, it was not about me specifically but about intersex in general, and I'm glad that I, unlike Semenya, had time to process the information and come out about it when I was ready to. I still had other issues I was dealing with -- namely: racism and homophobia -- so it took a year for me to embrace this additional minority status. Once I did, it was a positive turning point. I'd always felt strongly masculine and feminine, and now it made sense why these two presumably ""opposite"" traits existed, in me, side by side. I didn't think being intersex was a bad thing to be. I'd already learned that people can be prejudiced against things they're unfamiliar with, or are taught to dislike, and that we shouldn't take on their bigotry. On April 19, 2002, I appeared on the television news program ""20/20"" with a prominent urologist and ""expert"" on intersex conditions. When asked why he supported ""corrective surgeries"" he answered, ""Society can't accept people of different colors, and now we're supposed to accept somebody with genitalia that don't match what their gender is? I do not believe this society is ready for it."" Intersex folks are not some new invention that people need to be ""ready for:"" we exist and always have. Resistance to accepting us has created the mess that Semenya now finds herself in. If medicine had been more upfront about intersex conditions rather than pretending they're just male and female as usual, they could have avoided ruining the career of some athletes. Whichever condition Caster Semenya has, she shouldn't be made to suffer for others' mistakes. Since infancy, she's been legally labeled, raised, and accepted as female. To be told that she can't compete as one now would be like being a U.S. citizen all your life, but being suddenly denied a passport because somebody decided that the city you were born in is actually, sorry, on the wrong side of the border. For thirteen years I've been outing myself as intersex just to let folks know we exist, and I'm happy to say I've seen progress. I look forward to one day telling my god-daughter about how it used to be for us, and to hearing her say, ""Wow, I can't believe some people had problems accepting intersex. Humans can be so weird.""","Intersex writer Hida Viloria shares her experience of growing up intersex .

"(Mental Floss) -- We remember Henry Ford as the automotive magnate who perfected assembly line technology, but he also dabbled in ambitious social programs, including one in which he hired ex-convicts straight out of Sing Sing to staff his factories. Henry Ford, pictured in 1942, unsuccessfully attempted to increase the rubber supply with a plantation in Brazil. Although many of these efforts were successful, Ford's ill-fated foray into the Brazilian jungle was a notable and fascinating exception. The plan . If you're going to make millions of cars, you're going to need an awful lot of rubber. In 1927, Ford came up with a novel plan: He'd solve his rubber problem and test out his lofty theories about social planning. If everything went well, he could craft both a utopia full of healthy, productive workers and a direct pipeline of coveted rubber to Detroit. Ford approached the task with characteristic zeal. He talked the Brazilian government into granting him 10,000 square kilometers of land in the Amazon rain forest -- a plot that was nearly twice as big as the state of Delaware -- in exchange for a 9 percent cut of the plantation's profits. In theory, this setup seemed like one of Ford's ideas that would shake out pretty well, and in 1928, Ford sent a barge full of supplies from Michigan down to his new plantation town, which was dubbed ""Fordlandia."" Growing rubber in the jungle . Unfortunately for Ford's stockholders, though, the captain of industry didn't always have a great eye for detail. (One famous story about Ford was that he disliked accountants so fiercely that he never had his company audited. By the end of his tenure, the Ford Motor Company allegedly had no idea exactly how much it cost to build a car.) Ford didn't check to see if the plantation was suitable for growing rubber. According to Greg Grandin, author of ""Fordlandia: The Rise and Fall of Henry Ford's Forgotten Jungle City,"" Ford never consulted any sort of expert on rubber cultivation; he just sent a bunch of supplies and managers into the jungle hoping to grow some rubber. Mental Floss: Henry Ford and others who survived bankruptcy . Ford was legendarily contemptuous of experts, but he could have saved some serious dough if he'd just hired a consultant to tell him that the plantation wasn't at all suitable for growing rubber. The land wasn't very fertile, but that wasn't the main problem. The real difficulty was that it's practically impossible to farm rubber in a plantation setting in the Amazon rainforest. To grow the trees on a commercial scale, you've got to pack them in fairly close together, and at that point they become incredibly susceptible to blight and insect attacks. Fordlandia's trees were no exception, and caterpillars and blight quickly decimated the fields. Not exactly a worker's paradise . Obviously, the rubber production part of the Fordlandia got off to a rocky start. How was the ""worker's paradise"" part of things going, though? Even more abysmally. The American managers and their families that Ford imported from Michigan weren't accustomed to the sweltering Brazilian heat and headed back north with an alarming frequency. The heavy machinery used on the plantation left deep ruts in the soft soil, which collected stagnant water and became breeding grounds for malaria-ridden mosquitoes. Ford had attempted to design Fordlandia like any American town, complete with schools, restaurants, a golf course, and shops. The catch here, though, was that the indigenous Brazilians who farmed the rubber weren't used to living in a stylized American community. Worse still, the plantation's workers were expected to work a strict shift from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m., whereas normal harvesting practices in the region saw workers hit the fields before dawn, take a long break, and then head out again at twilight to save themselves the misery of working in the tropical midday heat. Food fights . Ford's influence extended all the way down to the residents' diets, and while the indigenous workers weren't crazy about having to eat American foods, they were livid about having to eat in a cafeteria setting rather than enjoying the homestyle meals to which they were accustomed. Eventually, the workers decided they'd had enough of the affront of cafeteria dining and rioted during a meal. Mental Floss: Three historical food fights . As the American managers fled to the safety of boats, the workers destroyed their mess hall and continued to riot until Brazilian soldiers came in to suppress violence. Another sticking point for the workers was Ford's insistence that his model community be entirely free of alcohol and tobacco. Although Prohibition wasn't exactly an unqualified success at home, and although alcohol was still legal in Brazil, Ford stayed firm on his booze ban. Workers who needed a drink were forced just outside the city limits to buy a bottle of cachaca; enterprising liquor salesman could simply paddle by on the river and unload their wares. Mental Floss: Why is the drinking age 21? End of the road . Eventually, even though Henry Ford steadfastly insisted that the community could thrive and help introduce American-style industrialization to the rest of the world, it became abundantly clear that the noble Fordlandia experiment was a flop. After the perfection of synthetic rubber in 1945, Ford sold the plantation at a $20 million loss and left Brazil. Just how much of a fiasco was the Fordlandia experiment? Although Ford spent 17 years trying to produce rubber on the plantation, no Ford car ever rolled off the assembly line with a single bit of Fordlandia's rubber in it.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A handful of people rallied outside the Japanese Embassy on Saturday to show support for an American man who is jailed in Japan, accused of trying to kidnap his own children. Amy Savoie calls on Japan to release her husband during a rally outside the Japanese Embassy in Washington. During the demonstration, Christopher Savoie's wife, Amy, along with others from the Children's Rights Council of Japan -- a group that advocates visitation for both parents in divorce cases, and which organized Saturday's event -- called for Savoie's release. ""It makes me feel wonderful to know that these people are calling him a hero, saying he's brave, and I just hope he can come home and say thank you to all these people who've supported him,"" Amy Savoie told CNN. Christopher Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, allegedly abducted his two children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his ex-wife walked them to school Monday in a rural town in southern Japan, police in Japan said. With the children, Savoie headed for the nearest U.S. consulate in the city of Fukuoka to try to obtain passports for them, screaming at guards to let him in the compound. Savoie was steps away from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil when Japanese police arrested him. Amy Savoie said the separation is taking a toll on her. ""I just wish I could talk to him, but I am forced to live with the fact that I can't talk to him. So I have to soothe myself and comfort myself with what he would say right now, and I just hope he's doing well,"" she said. Christopher Savoie and his first wife, Noriko Savoie, were married for 14 years before their divorce in January. The couple, both citizens of the United States and Japan, had lived in Japan but moved to the United States before the divorce. Noriko Savoie was given custody of the children and agreed to remain in the United States. Christopher Savoie had visitation rights. During the summer, she fled with the children to Japan, according to court documents. A U.S. court than granted Christopher Savoie sole custody. Japanese law, however, recognizes Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian. The law there also follows a tradition of sole-custody divorces. When the couple splits, one parent typically makes a complete and lifelong break from the children. Complicating the matter further is the fact that the couple still are considered married in Japan because they never divorced there, police said Wednesday. And, police said, the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports. A 1980 Hague Convention standardized laws on international child abduction, but Japan is not a party to that agreement. If a child in Japan is taken against the wishes of the recognized Japanese parent, Japanese law considers the person who took the child an abductor. Christopher Savoie will be jailed for at least 10 days while Japanese prosecutors sort out details of the case.","Christopher Savoie's wife, Amy: ""I just wish I could talk to him""

"(CNN)  -- Tennis officials reacted with disappointment on Wednesday to Andre Agassi's revelation that he had used a banned drug and then lied about it to avoid a ban. Agassi's admission that he took the stimulant crystal meth in 1997 will come in a soon to be published autobiography which is being serialized by The Times of London. He avoided a three-month suspension by claiming in a letter to the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) that he failed a doping test because a drink had been 'spiked' with the crystal meth. Under today's anti-doping rules, the American legend could have faced a two-year ban from the circuit. The ATP issued a statement Wednesday in which it said that an independent panel would make the final decision on a doping violation. ""The ATP has always followed this rule, and no executive at the ATP has therefore had the authority or ability to decide the outcome of an anti-doping matter,"" the statement read. World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) president John Fahey said they could not take retrospective action against the eight-time grand slam winner because of its eight-year statute of limitations, but demanded the ATP investigate fully. ""WADA would, however, expect the ATP, which administered its own anti-doping program at that time, to shed light on this allegation,"" Fahey said in a statement. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) took over responsibility for the ATP's doping program in 2006 and its president Francesco Ricci Bitti said that Agassi's revelations showed that a tough anti-doping program was needed. Agassi did find strong support from Nicolas Hayek, chairman of Swatch Group, for whom Agassi acts as an ambassador. He told CNN that his company would stick with the 39-year-old Agassi in his current role. ""He's admitted a mistake and it's fine with us,"" he said.","Tennis governing bodies to consider Andre Agassi's doping revelations .

"(CNN) -- In just a few short weeks, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach could wake up at his home in Englewood, New Jersey, with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi camped a few feet from his front lawn. Gadhafi may be staying in a tent on the front lawn of a New Jersey house owned by the Libyan Mission. The authoritarian ruler of Libya is rumored to be planning to stay in an air-conditioned tent on the front lawn of a house owned by the Libyan Mission when he attends the U.N. General Assembly meeting in September. Members of the predominately Orthodox Jewish Englewood community are less than enthused about a visit from a leader who has made anti-Zionist statements in the past. The recent release of the convicted Lockerbie bomber to Libya has heightened the animosity. On Monday, Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, called for the U.S. Department of State to restrict Gadhafi's travel to the area around U.N. headquarters in New York City, saying in a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton he ""was particularly concerned by news reports indicating that [Gadhafi] plans to stay in New Jersey, where the families of many Pan Am 103 victims reside."" A representative from the Libyan Mission in New York would not confirm Gadhafi will stay in Englewood, only that he is scheduled to come to New York. Gadhafi has a history of setting up his extensive tent when visiting other countries, including Russia and France. Media reports have said that his request to pitch his tent in Central Park had been denied, and the New Jersey property was a likely second choice. Boteach said he had previously been willing to approach Gadhafi's rumored visit with an open mind, but he backtracked after the Lockerbie bomber's release. ""Judging by his actions, he hasn't changed one iota,"" Boteach said. ""He loves terrorists and welcomes them as heroes and speaks with a forked tongue. As soon as he had the opportunity he lionized people who committed murderous acts. Gadhafi is a fraud. I don't want him or his security team near my home."" Englewood Mayor Michael Wildes said he was not informed of plans to erect a tent on the property, and no special permissions were requested from the zoning department. Only through neighborhood residents and media coverage was he alerted to construction on the house that, according to Boteach, began around three months ago. The mayor said he was ""mortified as a Jew and embarrassed as an American that a financier of terrorism is on U.S. soil. [Gadhafi] is someone who has embraced terrorism and has not changed his spots."" Wildes said the Libyan Mission has ""not paid a nickel"" on taxes for the property, and said he would only be ""willing to sit down with him if he brings a check to cover years of back taxes and overtime pay for the additional police forces needed for his stay, and apologizes to the Jewish residents and the Lockerbie victims' families of New Jersey."" Boteach, in a piece posted Thursday on The Huffington Post, where he is a regular contributor, said the residence had been left ""derelict and neglected"" for many years until the recent construction. In opposition to Gadhafi's possible visit to Englewood, Boteach said he plans several steps, including legal action, which he said would be in response to construction workers knocking down his fence and cutting down his trees. ""My plan is to sue them, extract as much money as possible and use Libyan money for planting trees instead of buying bombs,"" he wrote in another Huffington Post piece Monday. Boteach and Wildes also are planning a protest at the construction site on Sunday.","Gadhafi travels with air-conditioned tent which he stays in .

"(CNN) -- Milwaukee, Wisconsin, police have arrested a man whose DNA linked him to the bodies of nine women killed over 21 years, officials said at a news conference Monday night. Walter E. Ellis, 49, was arrested after police matched a DNA swab taken from him last week to the victims. Walter E. Ellis, 49, was arrested after police matched a DNA swab taken from him last week to DNA left on the bodies of nine women killed since 1986. Police said eight of the women were prostitutes and one was a runaway involved with drugs. They were all killed within a 3-square-mile area of Milwaukee's north side. ""This case was solved with shoe leather and science,"" Milwaukee Police Chief Edward A. Flynn said. ""Continuing advances in DNA technology have enabled us to link these homicide cases, and it was good police work pursuing numerous leads that led to the arrest of a suspect."" The homicides occurred between 1986 and 2007, police said.  See where the bodies were found Â» . Ellis was charged Monday with two counts of first degree murder relating to two of the deaths: 41-year-old Joyce Mims, who was killed in 1997, and 28-year-old Ouithreaun Stokes, who was killed in April 2007. Police said more charges are likely. It wasn't immediately clear whether Ellis had obtained an attorney. Police said other victims linked to Ellis through DNA were: Tanya L. Miller, killed in 1986; Deborah L. Harris, killed in 1986; Sheila Farrior, strangled in 1995; Florence McCormick, strangled in 1995; Irene Smith, killed in 1992; Carron D. Kilpatrick, killed in 1992, and Jessica Payne, killed in 1995. Flynn told CNN it was hard for investigators to discern a geographic pattern for the homicides. In the 20-year period, more than 2,000 slayings occurred in Milwaukee, he said -- 200 of them in the same area where the bodies were found. Another challenge investigators faced was the developing technology of DNA evidence. The technology in 2009 far exceeds that available in 1986 or even 2002, he said. It was only this year that police were able to link the nine homicides with the same DNA pattern. Even then ""we did not have anyone to match our DNA profile against, until we were able to get [Ellis'] toothbrush,"" he told CNN. A Wisconsin law passed in 2000 mandated the DNA collection from convicted felons. Ellis was released from prison in 2001 without having his DNA sample collected, Flynn said. Because his name had surfaced in the investigation and because he was also listed in two FBI databases, authorities decided to investigate him further and were able to obtain the search warrant that allowed them to collect his DNA from his toothbrush, the police chief said. News of Ellis' arrest shocked those who knew him. ""That was just my ex-boyfriend,"" his former girlfriend, Chanita, told CNN affiliate WISN-TV. She asked that her last name not be used. ""I didn't know nothing about nothing like this. I'm getting shivery now cause you're talking about some strangling stuff. Lord have mercy on me. I'm just a wreck right now. I can't believe this. I'm trembling in here. I'm shakin'."" Chanita said she dated Ellis for four years. ""I can't believe it. This is a shock,"" she told WISN. ""I got like goose bumps on my arms instantly when you told me that. I'm like no way -- not Walter -- I can't see him hurting nobody."" For relatives of the victims, the news brought mixed emotions. ""I knew they was gonna get him, I knew it,"" Patricia Donald, best friend of victim Deborah Harris, told WISN. ""Finally he can't hurt nobody anymore."" For her and others, like Sandy Farrior, whose daughter Sheila was linked to Ellis, it was news that helped bring closure. ""Late justice is better than no justice,"" he told WISN. In addition to advances in DNA technology, officials attributed the break in the case to the repeated investigation of cold cases by the Milwaukee Police Department's Homicide Task Force Cold Case Unit. Although Mims and Stokes were strangled about a decade apart, similar DNA on their bodies helped lead police to a suspect.  Watch where cops got DNA sample Â» . Mims was found strangled and lying on her back wearing only socks on June 20, 1997, in a small closet near a living room in Milwaukee, according to court documents. Police found DNA on her body, but there were no matches in the system, the court documents show. On April 27, 2007, Stokes was found strangled, partially clothed and lying face down in a living room in Milwaukee, according to court documents. When lab technicians tested the DNA found on her body, they found it directly matched the DNA found on Mims. On August 29 of this year, armed with a search warrant, police took a toothbrush and razor from Ellis' home. Testing showed the DNA found on Mims and Stokes was a match to Ellis, according to court documents. Ellis has been charged at least 10 times with varying offenses ranging from violent crimes to property crimes between 1981 and 1998, though some of the charges were dismissed, online court records in Wisconsin show. He was sentenced to five years in state prison after he pleaded no contest to a reckless injury charge in 1998. None of the victims linked to Ellis was killed during the time he was in jail. However, two men were charged in slayings later linked to Ellis, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Curtis McCoy was charged in October 1994 with killing Kilpatrick, but he was later acquitted by a jury, the newspaper reported. It also said Chaunte Ott, who was convicted of killing Payne, served 13 years in prison before being released in January, after DNA analysis showed semen found on the girl's body was not his. CNN's Gabriel Falcon contributed to this report.","DNA found on bodies of nine women matched to Walter E. Ellis, police say .

"(CNN)  -- A study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics indicates about 1 percent of children ages 3 to 17 have autism or a related disorder, an increase over previous estimates. Children at the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta, Georgia, receive instruction on March 5, 2009. ""This is a significant issue that needs immediate attention,"" Dr. Ileana Arias, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. ""A concerted effort and substantial national response is warranted."" The study used data from the federal government's 2007 national survey of children's health. The survey of parents was conducted by the Health Resources and Services Administration, and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The results are based on a national telephone survey of more than 78,000 parents of children ages 3 to 17.iReport.com: How has autism affected your family? In the study, parents were asked whether a health care provider had ever told them their child had an autism spectrum disorder. ASD is a group of brain disorders comprising autism and two less severe disorders: Asperger's disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Children with the disorder show impairment in social interaction and in their ability to communicate. They often display repetitive behavior.  Watch families discuss autism Â» . The investigators also asked a follow-up question: Were the children considered to have ASD now? Nearly 40 percent of the parents and guardians said no. That finding led the authors to question whether some of the children originally diagnosed as having ASD may have been improperly diagnosed, since the disorders are not considered curable. But Kogan said the two surveys cannot be compared because the earlier investigators did not ask the follow-up question about whether the children were still considered to have the disorder. Still, based on the findings, lead author Dr. Michael D. Kogan of HRSA's maternal and child health bureau estimated the prevalence of ASD among U.S. children ages 3 to 17 at 110 per 10,000 -- slightly more than 1 percent. Boys were four times as likely as girls to have ASD, and non-Hispanic black and multiracial children were less likely than non-Hispanic white children. He estimated that 673,000 children have ASD in the United States. Monday's findings of nearly 1 in 100 appear to indicate an increase from the average of 1 in 150 that was reported in 2003, the researchers said. The researchers urged caution in interpreting the change, noting that an increase in diagnoses does not necessarily mean that more children have the disorder. It could simply reflect a heightened awareness of the disorder. ""We don't know whether the change in the number over time is a result of the change in the actual condition, in the actual number of conditions or in part due to the fact that the condition is being recognized differently,"" Arias said. She said that preliminary results from a separate, CDC-funded study she is working on also indicate that about 1 percent of children in the United States are affected by ASD. That study is to be published later this year, she said. ""This is a behavioral diagnosis, and it's difficult to make, and it's difficult to make at young ages,"" said Dr. Peter van Dyck, HRSA's associate administrator for maternal and child health. Half of the cases were considered mild by their parents, the study reported. The results underscore the importance of creating policies that will result in early identification and intervention, the officials said.

Martin is the author of the forthcoming book, ""The First: President Barack Obama's Road to the White House as originally reported by Roland S. Martin"" and of two other books, ""Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith"" and ""Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland Martin says conservative critics are wrong to chortle at the defeat of the Chicago Olympic bid. (CNN) -- Whenever President Obama has traveled overseas and offered pointed and direct assessments of the United States, some of them critical, Republicans have ripped him for criticizing America, saying a president should always defend the United States. So I want to hear the explanation by these so-called patriots of their giddy behavior over the United States losing the 2016 Olympic Games. Yes, the United States. The bid that was rejected Friday by the International Olympic Committee was not a Chicago, Illinois, bid. It was the official bid submitted by the United States Olympic Committee and was representative of the nation. Tokyo's bid was that of Japan; Madrid's was that of Spain; and Rio de Janeiro's was that of Brazil. Republicans want to spin the decision as a massive loss by President Obama and the Democrats who have always controlled Chicago politics. ""Hahahahaha,"" wrote Erick Erickson on the conservative ""RedState"" blog, ""I thought the world would love us more now that Bush was gone."" What the critics don't see is that Obama's loss on the Olympics is America's loss. Any red-blooded American who loves to see the American flag raised and the national anthem played when one of our own wins a gold medal should blast the Republicans' giddiness over the loss. I can recall crying along with millions of Americans when our hockey team beat the Russians and won the hockey gold in 1980. Where were those games? Lake Placid, New York. Euphoria spread all across the nation, not only because we beat the mighty Russians, but also because it took place on American soil. When Carl Lewis and Mary Lou Retton dominated the 1984 Olympic Games, we all beamed with pride because they represented the United States on American soil in Los Angeles, California. And when Michael Johnson stormed around the track to obliterate the world record in the 200-meter dash (since broken by Jamaica's Usain Bolt), we relished the win as he took a victory lap around the stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. Americans love home field advantage, and we always desire to show the rest of the world what we are made of. I don't care if Republicans want to rip President Obama over going to Copenhagen, Denmark, to pitch for the games. This isn't about politics. It's not about ideology. This is about America. OUR pride. Our chance to shine. Our loss of the games. So, to all the critics happy about us losing the 2016 games, turn in your flag lapel pins and stop boasting of being so patriotic. When an American city loses, like New York did in the the last go-round, we all lose. And all you critics are on the same level as the America haters all across the world. You should be shouted down for not backing your own country. The next time any of you bang out a press release about ""Buy American"" or ""Support our troops,"" remember this moment when your cynical, callous and small-minded brains happily rejoiced when America lost the 2016 Olympic Games. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin: The Chicago bid was made on behalf of the whole country .

"(CNN)  -- At least nine people were killed in Somalia's war-torn capital Mogadishu when mortars slammed into a home for disabled veterans, according to journalists and witnesses. Al Shabaab fighters display two bodies of Somali police officers during a battle August 12 in Mogadishu. At least 27 people were wounded in the Friday night incident, when Muslim militants fired mortars toward Mogadishu's port and struck a residential area. The mortars hit a home for former national army officers who were disabled in a late-1970s war with Ethiopia, the sources said. Insurgents from the Al-Shabaab militant group have been fighting to topple Somalia's government. Its fighters have frequently shelled the city's airport and seaport, which are controlled by the African Union and government forces. The United States is supporting the Somali government's fight against the insurgents, including providing weapons to government forces. Al Shabaab is on the U.S. list of terror organizations because of its ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network. The United States is concerned that Somalia's weak government could fall to the Islamist insurgency, as it did in 2006 before Ethiopian forces ousted the militants from power later that year.","Sources: Militants fired mortars toward Mogadishu's port, struck residential area .

"(CNN) -- Heavy rain that began pounding California on Tuesday threatened to unleash dangerous floods and mudslides, especially in areas ravaged by wildfires. Residents of La Canada Flintridge, California, fill sandbags to prepare heavy rains in the fire-affected area. ""Very heavy rain is likely over the Sierra Nevada and foothills from later today through Wednesday morning as a strong and very moist Pacific storm moves into the region,"" the National Weather Service said. Up to 8 inches of rain could fall in areas above 4,000 feet, it said. Forecasters described it as the first major storm of the season. The Santa Cruz County Office of Emergency Services issued a mandatory evacuation order for 60 homes in a section of Davenport, an unincorporated community north of Santa Cruz along the state's central coast. The San Lorenzo Valley high school, middle school, and elementary schools are closed, the county said. Many roads were flooding in Santa Cruz County, emergency management officials said. The area burned in the summer's Lockheed fire, increasing the chances of mudslides in the current storm. Wind gusts above 50 mph were reported from automated observation sites at high elevations, and rainfall was heavy over the Santa Cruz Mountains, the weather service said. Gusty winds were reported in the San Francisco Bay Area, but heavy rain there was expected to end by early evening. ""Although it has been very dry for a lengthy period of time, excessive amounts of rain of this magnitude may produce flooding in locations that normally do not flood during an early autumn rainfall,"" the weather service said. California's Emergency Management Agency was conducting conference calls with the National Weather Service to stay abreast of the latest reports, spokesman Greg Renick said. The agency had advised other agencies to make emergency preparations, he said. Sandbags have been positioned at vulnerable locations. ""We have activated the state Operations Center in Sacramento and also activated the centers in Los Alamitos and Oakland,"" Renick said. One major area of concern is the land burned by the Station wildfire in August and September, forecasters said. That 160,000-acre fire destroyed about 80 homes in Los Angeles County. ""The heavy rain will create favorable conditions for mud and rock slides over burn scars,"" said the weather service, which issued numerous flood watches and warnings. Forecasters said debris flows also were possible in or near areas burned by blazes such as the Big Meadows Fire in Yosemite National Park, the Power Fire in Tulare County and the fire in San Bernardino National Forest.","Evacuations ordered, schools closed near Santa Cruz .

"OKAZAKI, Japan (CNN) -- At Spencer Morrey's home, there are two constant sounds: his dad, Craig, murmuring, ""You're okay, Spence. You're okay, buddy,"" and the sound of a machine clearing the toddler's airway. Spencer Morrey, pictured with his father Craig, has severe cerebral palsy and requires 24-hour medical care. Both sounds come every few minutes, in between hugs, tears and kisses. Spencer has severe cerebral palsy and requires constant, 24-hour medical care. In Japan, a country that lacks sufficient medical services for disabled children, the only person to care for Spencer is his father. Morrey says his wife left, overwhelmed by the strain of their son's medical condition. That would be pain beyond what most parents could imagine. But Spencer's mother fled while pregnant with Morrey's daughter, Amelia. In more than a year, Morrey says he has only seen his daughter four times. ""She wouldn't recognize me,"" Morrey said, with Spencer propped on his lap. ""She wouldn't call me daddy. She's just starting to talk now. But she's not going to know who I am. I think she deserves my love. And I think she deserves to be with Spencer and Spencer deserves to be with her."" Morrey, a native of Chicago and a U.S. citizen, was married to a Brazilian woman of Japanese descent. They divorced in a Japanese court. Under Brazilian law, Morrey would likely have joint custody and guardianship of both children. What do you think about Spencer's case? Have your say . But in Japan, where only one parent gets custody of a child in a divorce, the family courts have left the case in legal limbo for a year because they have not decided which parent legally has custody of the children. Typically, the parent with physical custody of a child retains custody. Morrey has stayed in Japan the last year, trying to get the courts to recognize that he has joint custody of the children in Brazil (he has not yet applied for such custody under U.S. law).  Watch Kyung Lah's report on the case Â» . He is afraid that if he heads home for the U.S. with Spencer without that, he could be subject to international child abduction laws, and he also fears such a move could hurt his chances of getting the Japanese family court to give him joint custody of his daughter. Morrey has been forced to quit work to care for Spencer. The financial strain of living off his credit cards is adding to the stress of caring for a disabled child alone in a foreign country. Despite his pleading with court mediators and repeated court filings claiming that joint custody is the law in both the U.S. and Brazil, Japan's slow and antiquated family courts have let the case languish. ""Kids need both parents,"" Morrey said. ""Whether the parents are married or not is irrelevant in my mind. The Japanese courts, and I realize you're going against years and years of cultural differences and everything else, but they don't care about the welfare of the child. ""In Japan, it's considered too messy. It's too complicated. It deals with personal feelings, so they don't want to deal with it. So the best way is to not deal with it."" CNN contacted Morrey's ex-wife four times by telephone and once by fax. She declined to discuss the case. The International Association for Parent and Child Reunion believes there are an estimated 100 American families in situations like Morrey's in Japan and dozens involving those from Britain, France and Canada. One of those cases is that of American Christopher Savoie. Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, was arrested on September 28 in Yanagawa, Japan, for attempting to abduct his two children, eight-year-old Isaac and six-year-old Rebecca.  Watch more about this case Â» . Savoie drove his children to the nearest U.S. consulate in the city of Fukuoka to try and obtain passports for them. Steps away from the front of the consulate, Japanese police arrested him. Savoie is now in jail, awaiting a decision by prosecutors on a possible indictment. Savoie and his first wife, Noriko Savoie, were married for 14 years before their bitter divorce in January. According to court documents, she fled with the children to Japan in the summer. A U.S. court then gave Christopher Savoie sole custody of the children. But Japanese law recognizes Noriko Savoie as the sole custodian, despite the U.S. order. ""It's like a black hole,"" Morrey said. ""If you go through a divorce, there's this joke. If you have an international marriage with a Japanese, don't piss them off because you'll never see your kids again."" Not seeing his daughter Amelia again is what is keeping Morrey in Japan. He has been selling off everything he owns, trying to keep himself and Spencer afloat, hoping the Japanese court will bring him some legal connection to his child. He is stuck choosing between caring for his son, who needs the better resources of the U.S., and hoping to be a father to his daughter. ""How do you make that choice? It's not -- once you're a dad, you're always a dad.""","Craig Morrey's wife left him to care for their disabled son, Spencer, alone .

"YANAGAWA, Japan (CNN) -- Wearing a Nashville School of Law T-shirt, Christopher Savoie walked into a second-floor police interrogation room. In one corner, a stopwatch was running to hold him to the 15 minutes allotted for the interview. A Tennessee court awarded Christopher Savoie custody of his son, Isaac, and daughter, Rebecca. ""I'm so scared,"" he said. Savoie chose his words carefully, lest police Officer Toshihiro Tanaka cut short the rare interview Savoie was granted with CNN on Thursday. There were so many rules: No recording devices. No tough questions. Speak only in Japanese. ""I want Americans to know what's happening to me,"" Savoie continued in Japanese. ""I didn't do anything wrong. Children have the right to see both parents. It's very important for my children to know both parents."" But Japanese authorities disagree. They have charged Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, with kidnapping his two children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his estranged wife, Noriko, was walking them to school Monday in Yanagawa, a rural town in southern Japan.  Watch what else Savoie had to say Â» . He headed for the nearest U.S. consulate, in the city of Fukuoka, to try to obtain passports for the children, screaming at the guards to let him in the compound. He was steps away from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil. Japanese police, alerted by his estranged wife, arrested him. The Savoies were divorced in Tennessee in January after 14 years of marriage. Christopher Savoie had visitation rights with his children, but after he returned from a short summer trip, his estranged wife fled to Japan with the children, according to court documents. A United States court then granted sole custody to Savoie.  Watch why the case is complicated Â» . Japanese law, however, recognizes Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian, regardless of the U.S. court order. The law there also follows a tradition of sole custody divorces. When the couple splits, one parent typically makes a complete and lifelong break from the children. Complicating the matter further is the fact that the couple is still considered married in Japan, because they never divorced there, police said Wednesday. And, police said, the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports. A 1980 Hague Convention standardized laws on international child abduction. But Japan is not a party to that agreement. Savoie was out of luck. If a child in Japan is taken against the wishes of the recognized Japanese parent, the person who took the child is considered an abductor. ""Japanese people think she's the victim here,"" Savoie said. ""In the States, my ex-wife is the one who's in the wrong."" U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley recognized this case as a difficult one. Even though the United States has strong ties with Japan, on this particular issue, the two nations' points of view could not differ more, he said. In Yanagawa, those who have heard about the abduction case tend to side with the woman. ""They belong with their real mother,"" said one woman, herself a mother of two children. But most have not heard of the case, because it has not been reported in local newspapers or on television. Savoie's attorney, Tadashi Yoshino, knows the cultural divide will be hard to overcome. ""He technically may have committed a crime according to Japanese law but he shouldn't be indicted,"" Yoshino said. ""He did it for the love of his children."" Savoie, a law student who already has a Ph.D. and a M.D., will spend 10 days in jail while Japanese prosecutors sort out the details of the case. In the interrogation room, Savoie appeared exhausted. Tears welled in his eyes. He glanced over at the police officer, then paused to regain composure. ""I love you, Isaac, Rebecca,"" he said. ""Your daddy loves you forever. I'll be patient and strong until the day comes that I can see you both again. I am very sorry that I can't be with you."" He was grateful be able to get the words out. Moments earlier, the interview had almost ended after Savoie blurted out in English: ""I love you,"" a message intended for his current wife, Amy, in Nashville. Then, as is Japanese custom, he bowed. And from the other side of the glass barrier, he gave a thumbs up, mouthing the words, ""Thank you.""","Man charged with abducting his own children denies committing breach .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- As the man in the Dodgers jersey walked quickly around the perimeter of the infield, fans poured down from the bleachers begging for autographs. Pitbull says he learns from setbacks: ""Usually the negatives turned out to be the most positive for me."" No, it wasn't home run king Manny Ramirez. It was Armando Christian Perez, the Cuban-American rapper better known as Pitbull. In five years, he's gone from a mouthy Miami street hustler to a chart-topping hip-hop star whose infectious Caribbean beats have enticed crossover audiences to swing their hips and sing along -- even taking on some of the words in Spanish. His fourth studio album, ""Rebelution,"" debuted in the Top 10 on the mainstream Billboard chart. But Pitbull's growing profile means nada as he takes the mound to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of the game. ""I'm the only Cuban who never picked up a baseball in his life,"" he said, preparing. He awkwardly winds up and releases the pitch. It falls short, bouncing on the ground before reaching the plate. ""One more try!"" he signals. The second attempt is closer to the mark. It's symbolic of Pit's career. ""It's not how you start. It's how you finish it,"" he likes to say.  Watch how Pitbull leads his ""Rebelution"" Â» . Tommy Lasorda, the legendary Dodgers manager, is waiting to bust his chops as he leaves the infield. Later, we get the scoop on the conversation. (By the way, the Dodgers won that game.) CNN: Tommy Lasorda was out there giving you a little bit of grief. Pitbull: Tommy Lasorda told me, ""It was the worst throw I've ever seen in my life!"" I said, ""Well, I'll throw you in the studio. You rap, I'll play baseball."" He goes, ""I'll rap a whole lot better than that throw!"" (Laughs) CNN: How much do you deflect things with humor? Pitbull: [Humor is] everything. Everything. Usually the negatives turned out to be the most positive for me. In the music industry, any other artist would have looked at the situation I was in and thought, ""Oh man, this is not for me."" I looked at it more like [Darwin exploring] the GalÃ¡pagos Islands. You know -- survival of the fittest. CNN: Were you a troublemaker growing up? Pitbull: Not a troublemaker. I'm sharp. Slick, if you want to call it. What the street taught me how to do is how to hustle. How to make something out of nothing. CNN: In the music industry, street cred may help an artist. Pitbull: Anybody who's made it out of the street -- they want to do this (places index finger over his lips). Shh. CNN: Even though some of the struggles are similar, there doesn't seem to be a lot of crossover between African-American hip-hop artists and Latin-American hip-hop artists. Pitbull: You can't get a Diddy or Jay-Z to speak to the Latins. It's not gonna happen. There's a force field where they said, ""OK, we're going to let you here -- but that's it."" Diddy got the closest. Why? Because he had J. Lo. The only reason my grandmother knows Puff Daddy is because of J. Lo. But he couldn't cross that barrier. So as far as myself -- I guess I'm their role model. CNN: How much do you want to cross over? Pitbull: I have respect for Jay-Z and Diddy for what they did in the hip-hop game. But I want to be Celia Cruz. I want to be Gloria Estefan [both were born in Cuba]. I want to enterprise -- open clubs and restaurants. They've done it also -- but those are who I look up to. CNN: Your parents were both born in Cuba. Pitbull: They didn't want to leave Cuba! They would have stayed in Cuba. They didn't want to get out of there. There were forced out of that country. CNN: How did they come to Miami? Pitbull: My grandmother fought in the [Cuban] revolutionary war actually with Castro, because everybody thought that Batista was corrupt. I'm not saying that he wasn't, but it's almost like the lesser of two evils. [When she became disillusioned with the Castro government], my mother and my aunt got sent off in an operation called Peter Pan without their parents. She didn't see her mother for seven years. As far as my father -- he came over also. He didn't come in the Peter Pan, but they fled the country. CNN: Would you ever go to Cuba and play a concert there? Pitbull: No way. I'd never go to Cuba and play a concert. [I'd consider playing there] as soon as I know that it's confirmed that Castro's out of there. I mean, if you ask me, I think Castro's been dead for years. He handed power to RaÃºl, and he slips pictures here and there. He keeps giving these pictures to the media with the same shirt on -- same jacket, same everything. CNN: How do you feel about other artists of your generation who feel compelled to go and perform in Cuba as kind of an olive branch? Pitbull: Juanes just did it. Papa, you can't change Cuba. History will tell you that you can't change Cuba. I respect him as an artist -- he's like U2, the Bono of Spanish. I don't respect his decision. Maybe he doesn't really understand it at the end of the day because he's not Cuban. [Juanes is Colombian.] . But to each his own. There's too much suffering, too much pain from people who left that island, that have come over here and tried to change their life. CNN: Even though you were born in America, how much are you influenced by your Cuban roots? Pitbull: My mother, she's like, ""Look, you're American, son. You were born here in the States."" My father? My father said, ""You're Cuban-American."" My mother would call me Chris, because my middle name's Christian. My father would say, ""No, your name's Armando."" But in my blood, what it tells me is, ""You're Cuban-American."" The music is what makes you, the food is what makes you, the way you've been taught mentally.","Pitbull has had some crossover success; his new album debuted in Top 10 .

"(CNN) -- A single-engine airplane made an emergency landing on a California highway Sunday morning, though no major injuries were reported, authorities said. The Piper Comanche 260 carrying a married couple landed on the southbound lanes of U.S. Highway 101. The Piper Comanche 260 carrying a married couple landed on the southbound lanes of U.S. Highway 101 just outside Santa Barbara and a few miles from the airport, said California Highway Patrol spokesman Officer James Richards. The plane's engine quit, and as the pilot descended, he lost control of the plane and landed in the southbound lane facing oncoming traffic. The plane struck two vehicles while landing, then spun and hit another one with its tail, Richards said. One vehicle passenger was treated for minor injuries, he said. No other injuries were reported. The landing happened at 10:36 a.m. (1:36 p.m. ET) and held up traffic for less than two hours, Richards said. He added that the plane had departed Temecula in southwestern Riverside County, California, and was destined for the airport in Santa Barbara, a flight of about 180 miles. The pilot told authorities that he attempted to switch fuel lines during the flight, but was unable to restore power to the plane. He said he alerted a tower at the airport that a landing on the highway was imminent, Richardson said.","Piper Comanche 260 carrying a married couple landed on U.S. Highway 101 .

"(CNN)  -- Somalia said a senior al Qaeda operative tied to several attacks in East Africa was killed Monday in a U.S. strike in southern Somalia. Saleh ali Saleh Nabhan, pictured on the FBI's Web site, reportedly was tied to al Qaeda's East Africa operations. Intelligence sources have confirmed to the Somali government that Saleh ali Saleh Nabhan was killed, Information Minister Dahir Mohamud Gelle said Tuesday. ""We welcome that attack because those people targeted were murderers, and they are unwanted and unwelcome in Somalia,"" Gelle said. Nabhan's death will have ""a major impact"" on al Qaeda's operations in the Horn of Africa, according to one regional analyst. U.S. special operations forces used a helicopter to fire on a car Monday in southern Somalia, killing several people, including one they believed was Nabhan, U.S. officials told CNN earlier. Nabhan, 30, was born in Kenya and had been tied to attacks that included the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, according to the sources. More than 200 were killed, and 4,000 wounded in those attacks, most of them Kenyans. The United States targeted Nabhan in an airstrike in southern Somalia near the Kenyan border in March 2008, U.S. officials said at the time. In February 2006, the FBI announced that Nabhan was wanted for questioning in connection with the 2002 suicide bombing of an Israeli-owned hotel and the unsuccessful attack on an Israeli charter jet in Mombasa, Kenya. Ten Kenyans and three Israelis -- including two children -- were killed when three suicide bombers detonated a car bomb outside Mombasa's Paradise Hotel in November 2002. The bombing took place within minutes of an unsuccessful missile attack on an Israeli charter jet, which was taking off with 261 passengers and 10 crew members. President Obama signed off on Monday's operation, a senior U.S. official said. The United States had been monitoring the situation for days and had intelligence that Nabhan was in the area, the U.S. officials said. The officials who talked to CNN are familiar with the latest information on Monday's strike but did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to talk to the media. The U.S. helicopter flew from a U.S. Navy warship offshore, while the ship kept watch on the operation, one of the sources said. The warship was ready to rescue the American troops if they got into trouble. Farmers in the southeastern town of Barawe, Somalia, said they witnessed the assault. They said helicopters attacked a car and its occupants and that at least two people died. The witnesses said some helicopters landed and that some of the injured or dead were pulled into at least one helicopter. A U.S. official said the troops landed to take away the body believed to be that of Nabhan for positive identification. Nabhan is believed to be an associate of al Qaeda member Harun Fazul, who was indicted in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies. The U.S. military has long sought Nabhan because he is believed to be deeply involved in al Qaeda's East African operations, a senior U.S. official said last year. ""He was certainly one of the leading al Qaeda figures in East Africa,"" said Rashid Abdi, a Somalia analyst for the International Crisis Group, an independent advisory and analysis organization. Nabhan ""has been living in the shadows"" in Somalia and not much is known about his recent activity, Abdi said. ""The fact that he is now out of the picture will have a bigger impact on al Qaeda than on Al-Shabaab,"" he said, referring to the Islamist militia in Somalia that has ties to al Qaeda. ""He is a man with an important organizational memory, and if a key figure like him is killed, it always has a major impact."" Al-Shabaab is waging a bloody battle against Somalia's transitional government and is on the U.S. list of terrorist organizations because of its al Qaeda ties. There are growing concerns that Somalia could be the next base for al Qaeda as U.S. forces pound their positions in Afghanistan and Pakistan. CIA Director Leon Panetta recently said the intelligence agency is keeping tabs on the region as a possible destination for fleeing al Qaeda operatives. Journalist Mohammed Amiin Adow and CNN's David McKenzie, Barbara Starr and Ed Henry contributed to this report.","NEW: Analyst calls operative ""one of the leading al Qaeda figures in East Africa""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A man dubbed ""the Field Marshal"" by one advocacy group for alleged third-world arms dealing has been arrested on charges that he conspired to illegally export U.S. F-5 fighter jet engines and parts to Iran. An Iranian F-5 fighter jet lands in southern Iran during a military exercise on June 23, 2009. Jacques Monsieur, 56, a Belgium native who currently lives in France, was arrested Friday in New York, officials said. An indictment also charges Dara Fotouhi, 54, an Iranian living in France, with participating in the alleged crime. Fotouhi remains at large, official said. Monsieur pleaded not guilty at an arraignment Wednesday in Mobile, Alabama, where he is being held. He and Fotouhi are charged with conspiracy, money laundering and smuggling, as well as violations of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. According to the indictment and an affidavit filed in the case, both are experienced arms dealers who have been actively working with the Iranian government to procure military items. The F-5 Freedom Fighter, also called the Tiger, is built by Northrop and is used by the U.S. military for training. It is also sold overseas as a combat aircraft. The F-5 engine and parts are listed on the U.S. Munitions List and may not be exported from the United States without a license from the State Department, said John Morton, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and they can not be exported to Iran without a license from the Treasury Department. In a 2002 report by the Center for Public Integrity, a citizen advocacy group, Monsieur was nicknamed ""the Field Marshal"" for allegedly acting as a middle-man in numerous arms deals with war-torn countries. The center's report said Monsieur is ""believed to be among the biggest arms traffickers in Europe"" and said he ""violated a United Nations embargo by shipping arms to Bosnia and Croatia during the long, bloody conflict in those countries, with the approval, he later claimed, of both the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the ... French domestic intelligence service."" Morton said his agency launched an investigation in February when Monsieur contacted an undercover federal agent and indicated he wanted to buy engines for F-5 or C-130 aircraft for export to Iran. In subsequent e-mails to the agent, Monsieur requested engines for F-5 jet fighters. Officials said the engines could be used as replacements in fighters sold to Iran by the United States before the imposition of sanctions in 1995. In March, Monsieur met with the undercover agent in Paris and again requested engines and parts, the indictment alleges. They met again in May in London, where Monsieur introduced Fotouhi as a business associate and again discussed the export of F-5 engines to Iran, according to the indictment. During this negotiation, it says, Monsieur and Fotouhi asked the agent if he could use U.S. shipping or export authorization documents that falsely indicated the items were going to Colombia. In July, Monsieur and Fotouhi wired about $110,000 from a bank in the United Arab Emirates to one in Mobile, Alabama, the indictment says. ""The two believed the funds would be used for the purchase of F-5 aircraft parts,"" Morton said. Monsieur indicated he would deposit an additional $300,000 as a down payment for the purchase of two jet engines. ""This is part of our long-standing efforts to ensure that sensitive military equipment is not exported in violation of U.S. law and against the international interests of the United States,"" Morton said.","A man dubbed ""the Field Marshal"" allegedly tried to get F-5 engine parts for Iran .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Obama administration is working on a substantial sanctions package against Iran in case current diplomatic efforts to curb its nuclear program fail, top officials told Congress on Tuesday. Treasury Under Secretary Stuart Levy also developed some of the existing financial sanctions against Iran. Under Secretary of the Treasury Stuart Levy, who developed some of the existing financial sanctions against Iran under the Bush administration, said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing that the ""comprehensive"" plan would target ""key vulnerabilities and fissures"" in Iran to show Tehran that it would face ""serious costs"" for thwarting international demands. ""It takes into account that no single sanction is a 'silver bullet'; we will need to impose measures simultaneously in many different forms in order to be effective,"" Levy said. He stressed, however, that the United States would be mindful of actions that would harm the Iranian people or undercut the opposition battling the Iranian government. The hearing comes as some members of Congress push for tougher U.S. sanctions on the Iranian regime in light of the recent revelation that Iran was building a second uranium enrichment facility near Qom, a dramatic development that jacked up tension between Iran and international powers. During talks last week in Geneva, Switzerland, between Iranian officials and representatives of the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, Britain, France, German, Russia and China -- Iran agreed to admit inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to the Qom facility. Tehran also agreed ""in principle"" to ship its low-enriched uranium produced in Iran to third countries for further enrichment for a nuclear reactor used for medical research. Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg told the panel Tuesday that one reason for the Obama administration's engagement toward Iran was to secure international support for sanctions if Iran continued to defy international demands. Last week's talks, he said, shined a ""spotlight"" on Iran that makes inaction more costly. Levy also stressed that an international coalition was key to keeping pressure on Iran. ""Because financial measures are most effective when imposed as part of a broad-based effort with support of the largest possible international coalition, we are working closely with our allies as we put together this strategy,"" he said. ""The less united we are in applying pressure, the greater the risk our measures will not have the impact we seek."" Several lawmakers expressed doubt that Iran would negotiate in good faith and threatened legislation to impose tough new sanctions against Tehran. Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, D-Connecticut, said he planned to move forward this month on a proposal to expand financial restrictions, impose new sanctions on Iran's oil and gas sectors and ban both the export of refined gasoline products to Iran and the import of Iranian goods. Steinberg said the United States and its allies will judge Iran's seriousness about the talks by whether it makes good on its commitments to ship the uranium out of the country and admit the IAEA inspectors, who are expected to visit the Qom facility October 25. ""By the end of the month, we will have some very clear indications of what their intentions are,"" he said.","""Comprehensive"" plan would target ""key vulnerabilities,"" official says .

"(The Frisky) -- Last weekend at a party, I noticed a toad-like man attaching himself to a beautiful, talented friend of mine. Not only was she way out of his league, looks-wise, but as I eavesdropped I discovered he was one of those dudes who delivers endless monologues instead of engaging in actual conversations. Too many women are afraid to say, ""No,"" says author. Ladies, I think we've all been stuck with that guy. Now it was my friend's turn. I could tell by her stunned look of horror that she wanted nothing to do with him, but she seemed frozen. My pal Ivan and I tried to intervene. ""Let's go get some cake,"" we suggested, physically pulling her from his side. Her relief was short-lived as he tracked her down and reattached himself to her hip. Watching her go through this made me think back on how many times I've been afraid to say no. Maybe ""afraid"" is the wrong word, but I've spent hours worrying about offending men who would've had no problem offending me if the situation were reversed. So I was thrilled when a copy of the hilarious book, ""The Power of NO: How to Keep Blowhards and Bozos at Bay"" landed on my doorstep. As the title suggests, TPON is about learning to not only say no, but to embrace no, something women seem to have an inexplicably harder time doing than men. I shot off an email to author Beth Wareham asking her why we womenfolk find it so painful to blow-off a troll. ""The psycho-sexual-societal bulls--t that makes women be such wimps in the face of an odious man is in our DNA. And young women often make the dreadful mistake of thinking everyone has to like them,"" she fired back. The Frisky: 13 Woman you're dating is a loser . ""I believe that some dumb guy bugging you is a great moment to really march out a lie,"" she continues. ""I mean, really, who goes around harassing strangers? Say, 'I have herpes.' Say, 'I am a hermaphrodite.' Say any damn thing you want to say but get him out of your face. You have ONE LIFE. Don't give chunks of it to this kind of dude!"" The Frisky: I'm just not that into anyone anymore . But for some guys -- and, let's face it, girls, too -- the word ""no"" can have an opposite effect, acting as an aphrodisiac. Wareham says, ""Human beings want what they do not and cannot have."" But sometimes you mean it! In that case, a persistent leghumper should be ignored, or reported to the cops if he gets stalky. ""Don't answer. It's your door, your cell. And, if it gets too bad, try 911,"" she advises. ""You wouldn't let anyone else harass you like that, would you?"" The Frisky: Are these dating habits cute or crazy? Okay, so how about the Ambiguous Dater -- the cute guy who wants to ""hang out,"" but never seems to make any plans. ""No hanging out, ever,"" Wareham insists. ""If the guy can't think up an interesting date and find $40.00 bucks for a burrito and movie, no go. Dating should never be 'hanging out.' Save that for marriage."" The Frisky: How to deal with ambiguous dater . How about dumping someone, I asked. How do you do that nicely? ""I am not the woman to ask if you want kindly, "" Wareham replied. ""But, I do know this, keep the tone friendly. The less you imbue language with strong emotion, the better. I once said, 'Dude, it was way fun and I learned lots. But you yelled Mommy! during sex.' That happened to me, by the way."" Hey, wait a minute . . . I once said yes to that guy too!

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Climate change is happening faster than previously predicted according to a new World Wildlife Fund report. The WWF say climate change threat has worsened in the 15 months since the IPCC last reported. Bringing together some of the most recent scientific reports and data, ""Climate change: faster, stronger, sooner"" reveals that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than the predictions made in the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report published in 2007. One of the most concerning aspects of recent data is evidence that, in some places, the Arctic Ocean is losing sea ice 30 years ahead of current IPCC predictions. Summer sea ice is now forecasted to completely disappear in the summer months sometime between 2013 and 2040 -- something which hasn't happened for over a million years. The report's author, geoscientist Dr Tina Tin told CNN: ""Arctic sea ice is melting much faster than everybody had been expecting. Why? Well, maybe it's because the positive feedback mechanisms have kicked in much quicker than we have been able to quantify."" Positive feedback mechanisms amplify changes occurring in the climate. In the case of the Arctic region there is a sort of vicious circle of warming occurring. White ice sheets perform an important function in moderating global temperature by reflecting heat from the sun back into space. But they have begun to melt as the earth has warmed. The result is more dark sea water which absorbs heat, which in turn warms the earth more and encourages further melting. Globally, sea levels are now expected to rise more than double the IPCC's most recent forecast of 0.59 meters before the end of the century. This will put millions of people in coastal regions at risk. World food production is also feeling the heat as yields of wheat, maize and barley had dwindled in recent months. In Europe, ecosystems in the North and Baltic Sea are believed to be experiencing their warmest temperatures since records began. And the Mediterranean is likely to experience an increased frequency of droughts. The WWF report also highlights a 2007 study conducted by the British Antarctic Survey. ""Widespread acceleration of tidewater glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula"" concluded that floating tide-water glaciers on the peninsula are losing ice faster and making a greater contribution to global sea level rise than was previously thought. Earlier this month, the WWF highlighted the impact that global warming is likely to have on Antarctic penguin colonies. According to Dr Tin, more Antarctic data is due to be published next year when the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research publish their findings. Scheduled for release in spring 2009 the ""Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment"" is expected to reveal more evidence of damaging climate effects on the continent. While Dr Tin says that it is true that parts of the Antarctic are not warming or perhaps even cooling, the Western Antarctic Peninsula has experienced some of the most rapid increases in warming. ""Over the past 50 years, it has warmed more than four times faster than the average rate of Earth's overall warming,"" Dr Tin said. But Dr Tin remains unsure whether this most recent climate data represents the beginning of a tipping point. ""We think there are possibly tipping points ahead and some scientists, in terms of the Arctic sea ice, think we have probably gone past the tipping point. But it's very difficult to get a strong handle on,"" she said. Nevertheless, she describes her report as a ""sobering overview"" which ""comes at a critical time during the political negotiations of the European Union's climate and energy package"". Newly elected Vice Chair of the IPCC and climate scientist, Jean-Pascal van Ypersele endorsed the WWF publication. ""It is clear that climate change is already having a greater impact than most scientists had anticipated, so it's vital that international mitigation and adaptation responses become swifter and more ambitious,"" van Ypersele said.","World Wildlife Fund report says climate change is happening faster than predicted .

"ASUNCION, Paraguay (CNN) -- The World Health Organization plans to send 2 million vaccines to Paraguay by Sunday after yellow fever emerged there for the first time in 34 years. Anxiety has gripped the South American nation of 7 million since authorities confirmed the first cases of yellow fever there last month. The disease has killed seven people and prompted the government to declare a three-month state of emergency. The government's health ministry is scrambling to find doses for a massive vaccination campaign. Nearby Brazil already has sent 1 million vaccines. The World Health Organization's shipment of 2 million doses is scheduled to arrive on Saturday or Sunday, according to a report Friday in the Paraguay's national news agency, Jakueke. Protesters have closed roads and started fires amid news reports that health workers were vaccinating certain politicians in their homes. ""I categorically reject these kinds of irresponsible allegations,"" said Health Minister Oscar Martinez Doldan. Meanwhile, some people have endured long waits for vaccines in sweltering heat. ""Citizens pay taxes for our health and education, but there are no vaccines here,"" Cynthia Shaerer, told CNN. ""We don't need speeches here. We need vaccines."" ""I want the president to tell me,"" another said. ""If we are going to die, who is responsible?"" People contract yellow fever from the bite of an infected mosquito. The disease causes fever, muscle pain, headaches, shivering, nausea and vomiting, the World Health Organization says. Most people improve after three or four days, but some enter a second ""toxic"" phase that causes fever, jaundice and blood in the vomit, the health organization says. About half of the people who enter the second phase of yellow fever die within 10 days. There is no treatment, so medical authorities recommend vaccinations. Yellow fever typically is found in tropical regions of Africa and Latin America. Most of the seven deaths in Paraguay happened in the town of San Lorenzo, about 12 miles (20 km) from the capital city of Asuncion. The public-health crisis comes two months before scheduled elections in Paraguay. Some analysts say it presents a delicate situation for the ruling Colorado Party, which has held power for 60 years.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A pharmacist testified that he warned Anna Nicole Smith's doctors and boyfriend that a list of medications intended for Smith a week after her son's death could be ""pharmaceutical suicide."" Anna Nicole Smith, with Howard K. Stern, was found dead in her hotel room in February 2007. The former Playboy model and reality TV star died five months later of what a Florida medical examiner ruled was from ""acute combined drug intoxication."" Ira Freeman, the chief pharmacist at Key Pharmacy in Los Angeles, testified on the seventh day of a preliminary hearing for Howard K. Stern -- Smith's lawyer and companion -- and co-defendants Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor. The three are charged with an illegal conspiracy to prescribe, administer and dispense controlled substances to an addict. Stern faces 11 felony counts, and the doctors were charged with six each. They are not charged in her death. Smith's death in a Hollywood, Florida, hotel on February 8, 2007, came just five months after the birth of her daughter, Dannielynn, and the sudden death of her 20-year-old son, Daniel, on September 10, 2006. Freeman testified that Kapoor faxed to him a list of six drugs that Eroshevich wanted to be sent to the Bahamas, where Eroshevich was treating Smith for anxiety and depression in the days after her son's death. ""The more I thought about it, the more concern I had that if she got hold of those medications, it could have fatal consequences"" Freeman said. The pharmacist said the dosages of the drugs were ""not appropriate."" Freeman said he consulted Dr. Greg Thompson, a pharmaceutical expert, who agreed with him and who offered to talk with Eroshevich about the dangers. Freeman said Thompson later told him that he found Eroshevich, a psychiatrist, to be ""way out of her league"" in her requests for strong drugs for Smith. At the time, Smith was holed up in her home in the Bahamas mourning her son's death. Her bodyguard said in earlier testimony that the home was under siege by photographers, keeping Smith inside with her windows covered. Thompson recommended to Eroshevich that she ""forget the paparazzi and get her to a hospital"" if she needed all of those drugs, Freeman said. Freeman said the stress of the publicity after Smith's death affected his own health, especially after the celebrity Web site TMZ.com published a copy of the faxed list of medications in question. Under questioning by the defense, Freeman said that over the previous five years he had filled prescriptions for Smith, he never saw any ""red flags"" that she was getting dangerous amounts of drugs. Charges against the three defendants also include the use of false names on prescriptions. Freeman said he always understood that prescriptions written under the pseudonym ""Michelle Chase"" were intended for Smith. It was a practice begun in 2001, three years before Kapoor or Eroshevich began treating her, to prevent ""trouble for her in terms of her celebrity status,"" Freeman said. After the preliminary hearing, which could last about three weeks, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry will decide whether a trial will be held. In earlier testimony, Smith's part-time bodyguard Maurice Brighthaupt said ""she just didn't want to deal with life after the death of her son."" Brighthaupt described Smith as ""manipulative"" when she wanted something. ""She manipulated Dr. Eroshevich,"" he said. Eroshevich, a Los Angeles psychiatrist, traveled to the Bahamas five or six times in 2006 to attend to Smith, he said. They had a mother-daughter friendship, not a doctor-patient relationship, Brighthaupt said. The doctor sometimes substituted placebos for the tray full of pills Smith regularly took for her complaints of pain and depression, he said. ""She was very concerned that we needed to wean her off the medications,"" Brighthaupt said. California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement Special Agent Danny Santiago testified that investigators found 12 prescription drugs, including dangerous opiates, in Smith's hotel room after her death. Seven of them were prescribed using Stern's name, although spelled ""Stearn,"" he said. A series of affidavits used by state investigators to obtain search warrants in their 2Â½-year inquiry was unsealed last month, revealing many details of the prosecution's case.","Testimony given at preliminary hearing for model's doctors, lawyer .

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda's second-in-command called on Pakistanis to back Islamic militants in the country's tribal areas against what he called an ongoing assault by American ""crusaders"" and the Pakistani army. Al-Qaeda's second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahiri appears in a video released on September 2, 2006. Punishment from God was promised for Muslims who did not follow the words of Ayman al-Zawahiri in a video that appeared on radical Islamist Web sites Thursday. ""The war in the tribal areas and Swat [Valley] is an inseparable part of the crusaders' assault on the Muslims the length and breadth of the Islamic world,"" al-Zawahiri said in the video, titled ""Path of Doom."" ""This is the battle, briefly and plainly; and this is why anyone who supports the Americans and Pakistan army -- under any pretext, ploy or lie -- is in fact standing with, backing and supporting the crusaders against Islam and Muslims."" The Pakistani military is fighting Taliban militants in the country's north, and missile attacks from suspected U.S. drones have targeted militant leaders -- one of them killing Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban. Reports from the region suggest government troops have dislodged the Taliban from many areas of the North West Frontier Province, but militant attacks continue daily. In the video, Al-Zawahiri suggested that the United States has wider goals in the region. ""They want to eliminate the Mujahedeen (Islamic militants) in the tribal areas so they can seek to smother the Jihad in Afghanistan,"" he said. NATO-led forces are battling the Taliban across the border in Afghanistan as well. U.S. and British forces launched offensives in Helmand province this summer. Al-Zawahiri warned Muslims that they have a religious duty to support the jihad, or struggle, or face punishment from God. ""No people abandons Jihad without Allah giving them a general punishment,"" he said, quoting the Quran. Al-Zawahiri also prayed for the annihilation ""the Americans and Jews"" and anyone who might help them.","Al Qaeda's second-in-command calls Pakistanis to back Islamic militants in video .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The National Organization for Women has sharply criticized comedian David Letterman, accusing him of promoting a hostile, uncomfortable work environment. David Letterman's behavior with employees has created ""a toxic environment"" in the workplace, NOW says. ""The latest Letterman controversy sheds new light on the widespread objectification of women in the workplace,"" NOW said in a statement Tuesday. ""Most women can attest to the fact that many workplaces are plagued with inappropriate behavior by men in power."" The ""Late Show With David Letterman"" host admitted last week on his CBS program that he had sex with unnamed employees and had testified about those liaisons before a New York grand jury as part of an alleged extortion attempt. A CBS producer, Robert ""Joe"" Halderman, is accused of threatening to go public with embarrassing information about Letterman's private life unless the 62-year-old funnyman ponied up $2 million.  Watch NOW's president slam Letteman, CBS Â» . Letterman made a public apology Monday to his wife, Regina Lasko, who, he said, had been ""horribly hurt by my behavior."" He said he is trying to repair that relationship. ""Either you're going to make some progress and get it fixed, or you're going to fall short and perhaps not get it fixed, so let me tell you folks, I got my work cut out for me,"" Letterman told the audience Monday night. Letterman married Lasko in March, and they have a 5-year-old son together. All the affairs took place before the marriage, Letterman's production company has said. One of the women who engaged in a sexual relationship with Letterman was identified as Stephanie Birkitt, an assistant to the talk show host and also a former live-in girlfriend of Halderman. Letterman spokesman Tom Keaney said that Birkitt is on a paid leave of absence from the show. NOW said Letterman's behavior was inappropriate in the workplace, saying all employees should be respected for their talent and skills. ""Recent developments in the David Letterman extortion controversy have raised serious issues about the abuse of power leading to an inappropriate, if not hostile, workplace environment for women and employees,"" NOW said in Tuesday's statement. Men such as Letterman make decisions on hiring and firing, who gets raises, who advances and who does entry-level tasks, NOW said. ""As 'the boss,' he is responsible for setting the tone for his entire workplace -- and he did that with sex. In any work environment, this places all employees -- including employees who happen to be women -- in an awkward, confusing and demoralizing situation,"" the group said. ""The National Organization for Women calls on CBS to recognize that Letterman's behavior creates a toxic environment and to take action immediately to rectify this situation. With just two women on CBS' board of directors, we're not holding our breath."" Those board members are Shari Redstone, vice chairwoman of the board and president of National Amusements Inc., which operates motion picture screens, and Linda Griego, president and chief executive of Griego Enterprises Inc., a business management company.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Friday urged stiff punishment for those who ""orchestrated and provoked"" the ""painful"" unrest after the June 12 presidential election, according to Iran's state-run Press TV. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said there is no evidence that would undermine the election results. ""I call upon security and judicial officials to decisively and mercilessly act with those who committed inhumane acts in the guise of the friends (of the establishment) since they inflicted damage on people and tarnished the image of the establishment, security and police forces,"" said Ahmadinejad, who made the remarks in a pre-sermon speech to Friday prayers. The government declared Ahmadinejad the overwhelming winner in the disputed June 12 election. The protests sparked a government crackdown that led to thousands of arrests, scores of injuries and at least 30 deaths. Judiciary officials say most of those arrested were released, though several dozen face charges as part of the mass trials. In his remarks Friday, Ahmadinejad said there has been no evidence found that would undermine the election results and he criticized Western nations for interfering in Iran's internal affairs before and after the election.","Urged stiff punishment for those who ""orchestrated and provoked"" unrest .

"BROOKLINE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Seth Barrett really enjoys his work. ""I love the variety of projects,"" he says. ""I love a new puzzle every day."" Seth Barrett is surrounded by scores of projects in his shop, ""Village Green Renewal."" He's at his workbench, chisel in hand, shaving bits of wood from one of several chairs brought into his repair shop by a customer. ""She asked me to give them some attention and get them to stay together,"" Barrett says. His shop, ""Village Green Renewal,"" will fix almost anything that can fit in the front door, as long as it doesn't require any kind of special licensing or permits. Barrett hopes that by getting people to repair items instead of replacing them with new ones, it will mean less trash heading for the landfill. ""The aim of the business is really about bringing back a traditional approach to conservation,"" says Barrett, ""because, clearly, the single best way to be green is to re-use the things that we already have.""  Watch Barrett in his shop Â» . His small shop is tucked into a corner of a building in Brookline, Massachusetts, on the outskirts of Boston. Old glass doorknobs, brass curtain rings and even a 1930s stove are some of the many functional and non-functional items that decorate the walls, cases and every corner. From his workbench, Barrett has a clear view of the pedestrians who pass by. ""Everybody who walks past the window smiles, without fail,"" he says, and customers seem to be responding to this unique and somewhat old-fashioned business. ""I think people are really excited too about the prospect of being able to repair these things that have been sitting in their basement forever that were once really special to them, and are, now, almost a sore spot, because it's just getting dusty and getting no attention."" A customer enters. ""I found another chair for you,"" says Beth Harris, hoisting a black and white chair into the shop. She has an old house and if she's not bringing in a set of chairs that need mending, she might be in looking for an unusual hardware item that Barrett probably has. ""It's great to have a resource that's right in the neighborhood,"" Harris says. Toasters, chairs and lamps are some of the things Barrett commonly fixes. But, occasionally, an odd item like a fancy purse or an old typewriter comes in. ""The more interesting the item is, the more time I'll spend on it off the clock,"" Barrett says. If he's really intrigued by the repair, he says, ""I sit and keep playing with this thing because it's cool."" What would be the most unusual request? ""The pigs win it, hands down,"" Barrett says, referring to a pair of leather pigs that needed some serious stitching up. He worked on them for many more hours than he actually billed because he enjoyed figuring out how to do it. Besides, as Barrett points out, ""How often do you see two giant leather pigs?"" For years, Barrett worked in large construction projects, renovating houses and building additions, but there was something about it that bothered him. ""I've always been made upset by all the bits of construction that go in the trash, and all the interesting stuff is overlooked because it takes time,"" he says. ""Large-scale construction is fraught with tremendous waste and no time to attention and beauty."" That's what draws him to these small, simple projects -- not only is he providing a service, but he also is an integral part of the community he grew up in, his home being about 700 feet away from the shop. Barrett feels a bond with many of his customers, because every item that comes in has a story that comes with it, and he's more than happy to hear that story. He enjoys working with the small details and says his job is very peaceful. ""I'm not trying to change the world.

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- Stalinist North Korea deployed new medium-range ballistic missiles and expanded special forces training during 2008, South Korea's defense ministry reported. North Korea's reclusive leader Kim Jong-Il . The missiles can travel about 3,000 kilometers (1,900 miles), possibly putting U.S. military bases in the Pacific Ocean territory of Guam within striking distance, the Ministry of National Defense said in its 2008 Defense White Paper, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported Monday. The paper, published after weeks of delay, calls the North's 1.2 million-strong military an ""immediate and grave threat,"" according to Yonhap. The report adds that the North has recently bolstered its naval forces, reinforcing submarines and developing new torpedoes, in addition to increasing its special forces training after reviewing U.S. military tactics in Iraq and Afghanistan. Tension between Pyongyang and Seoul has increased in recent weeks, with North Korea announcing it would scrap peace agreements with the South, warning of a war on the Korean peninsula and threatening to test a missile capable of hitting the western United States. U.S. and South Korean officials have said that North Korea appears to be preparing to test-fire its long-range missile, the Taepodong-2. Pyongyang tested one of the missiles in 2006, but it failed 40 seconds after launch. The missile is thought to have an intended range of about 4,200 miles (6,700 kilometers), which if true, could give it the capability of striking Alaska or Hawaii. North Korea has been involved in what is known as the six-party talks with the United States, Japan, Russia, South Korea and China, which is an effort to end the nation's nuclear program, which the U.S. says is linked to nuclear weapons.

"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- A Somali teen who left Minnesota to return to his native country last November has been reported killed. The 17-year-old, who was not named, was reportedly killed Friday in artillery fire in the violence-ravaged nation's capital of Mogadishu, said the Somali Justice Advocacy Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The center is asking federal officials for help in bringing the teen's body back to the United States for burial, executive director Omar Jamal said. The teen was among a group of young Somali-American men who left Minneapolis last year and were feared recruited by the extremist group, al-Shabaab, that has ties to al Qaeda, according to the U.S. State Department. Al-Shabaab is blamed for a surge of violence in Somalia, as insurgents group fight the government to implement sharia, a stricter form of Islamic law. The rebel group has said it has recruited many fighters in its battle. Al-Shabaab, also known as the Mujahedeen Youth Movement, was officially designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. government in March 2008. In October, Shirwa Ahmed, 27, a Somali-American who had been radicalized by al-Shabaab in his adopted home state of Minnesota, traveled to Somalia and blew himself up and 29 others. The incident, the first-ever suicide bombing by a naturalized U.S. citizen, raised red flags throughout the U.S. intelligence community. Somalis began arriving in the United States in significant numbers after the U.S. intervention in Somalia's humanitarian crisis in 1992. The Somali-American population is now concentrated in clusters primarily in Minneapolis; Columbus, Ohio; Seattle, Washington and San Diego, California. The potential recruitment of young Somali-American men has been made possible by ""a number of factors that come together when a dynamic, influential and extremist leader gains access to a despondent and disenfranchised group of young men,"" Andrew Liepman, deputy director for intelligence at the National Counterterrorism Center, said earlier this year. Many refugees, he said, ""lack structure and definition in their lives"" and are ""torn between their parents' traditional tribal and clan identities, and the new cultures and traditions offered by American society."" CNN's Chris Welch in Minneapolis contributed to this report.","17-year-old who left Minnesota to return to Somalia feared killed in Mogadishu .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- The number of people killed in a car bombing in Afghanistan's capital rose to 26, including six Italian soldiers, Afghan authorities said Saturday. The coffins of six Italian soldiers killed in a suicide attack in Kabul return to Rome. Sixteen people died in the blast Thursday, and at least 55 Afghan civilians were wounded. Ten have died from their injuries since the bombing. The explosion Thursday targeted a mostly residential area near the Supreme Court in Kabul, a witness said. The bodies of the Italian soldiers killed in the blast returned to Italy Sunday, their coffins draped in the red, green and white Italian flag. Dignitaries, relatives and row upon row of uniformed troops stood on the airport tarmac as the coffins were carried off the plane, television pictures from the scene showed.

The six deaths marked largest number of Italians killed in a single day in Afghanistan.  Watch more about Italy's Afghan mission Â» . Before the remains left for Rome, the Italian military, international troops and dignitaries held a service in the Afghan capital. ""It's a tragedy for us,"" Lt. Col.

Tommaso Ferro of the Italian military. The arrival of the soldiers' remains was televised nationally in Italy. The bodies were taken for an autopsy. A day of mourning is scheduled in Italy on Monday, the same day as the burial service. After the attack, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said it would be ""best"" for the country's troops to leave Afghanistan as soon as possible. Berlusconi gave no timeline for a withdrawal, but said any pullout would have to be coordinated with allies. The 500 troops Italy sent to Afghanistan this summer will be home by Christmas, Ignazio La Russa, Italy's defense minister said. The troops were sent ahead of the Afghan presidential election August 20. The rest of Italy's 2,800 troops in Afghanistan will withdraw only when NATO calls for it, La Russa said.","Explosion targeted a mostly residential area near the Supreme Court in Kabul .

"(CNN) -- Stringer is dead. Omar is dead. And soon, ""The Wire"" will be, too. Sonja Sohn, Wendell Pierce and Dominic West discuss matters on the ""Wire"" finale. The show, broadcast by HBO, which -- like CNN -- is a division of Time Warner, created complex storylines weaving together the lives of Baltimore's cops, drug dealers, politicians, port workers, schoolchildren and educators and now journalists. It also created a devoted fan base, including CNN staffers Jo Parker, who coincidentally worked at The Baltimore Sun for 13 years, and Rachel Clarke. Both are veteran watchers of previous seasons who have lapped up this year's story, where events on the street and inside the murder squad become ever more entwined with politics and news, complicating everything they touch. Here, they talk about whether the keenly awaited finale matched expectations. Clarke: Were you satisfied? Parker: No. I expected ""The Wire"" to startle me and make me think right up until the series finale, but in the end it felt too networky. Yes, the storylines were completed and there was a resolution of sorts for each major character, but it all seemed to be too neatly tied ... red ribbon, anyone?  Gallery: Get to know the characters of ""The Wire"" Â» . Clarke: Yes, I'm all for schmaltz, but that's not why I watched ""The Wire."" In previous seasons, the show has had me sobbing (Bodie's killing), screaming blue murder (Bubbles' suicide attempt) and spiraling downward as I awaited the really bad things that had to happen (the parting of the ways between Stringer and Avon was never going to go well). This time, I had the familiar sinking feeling about some characters and plot lines as they played out, but this time, the writing didn't have the same killer instinct. Or maybe ""The Wire"" has just given me a really dark view of the world, of Baltimore, of humanity, and I should lighten up. Parker: I did experience one shocker during the finale involving a longer-term character. I'm surprised now that I didn't see it coming any more than the character did! Clarke: I know what you're talking about. Sure, there was a moment where I gasped. And there were other vintage ""Wire"" themes and moments. The questions over a moral code, how it's rarely if ever black and white and how real life and real people are just too complicated to fall into that simple ""good or bad"" template. ""Good"" people do bad things and ""bad"" people do good things. And circumstances and the bigger picture will often intervene to steer even the best from the path of the angels. But that's where this season as a whole hasn't matched the other four. The newspaper characters were simply good or evil. But you worked at The Baltimore Sun, so maybe that's true to life?! Parker: There were definitely some folks I'd consider good or evil at The Sun, but none who flat-out grew horns like Templeton, Whiting and Klebanow. (OK, maybe the Templetonesque dude.) I worked there for 13 years and left during ""The Wire's"" run. So I know creator David Simon peripherally and some of the situations he alludes to this season fairly well. I expected this season to be even more compelling to me, if that was possible. Instead, I found the new characters too one-dimensional. I didn't emotionally bond with any of them -- even though some bore the names of my real former colleagues -- so I really didn't care what happened to any of them in the finale. Clarke: Me too, but then I'm still mourning Stringer from season three when good and evil were mixed so well and you could happily cry over the comeuppance of a calculating, cold, murderous drug dealer. There are a lot of old memories from earlier seasons in the finale, but that just made me nostalgic for the earlier stuff. Parker: No, no! Don't talk about ""nostalgia""! That word is ruined for me now! Clarke: For all the delight I got at various lines and shots, I thought some of the last episode was just trying to be too clever. Still, I'll be watching the finale all over again on Sunday. Will you? Parker: I wanted different endings for some characters, but I'm not the one cashing HBO's check. Despite my quibbles at the last season and the finale, I'll be watching it again and mourning its passing. It was a complete treat. Although I'm still ticked off. Clarke: True that.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- This year is the 50th birthday of the Copa Libertadores, South American football's equivalent of Europe's Champions League. Argentina's Boca Juniors salute their fans before a Copa Libertadores match against Uruguay's Defensor Sporting. The Libertadores is the most prestigious tournament in South American club football, seeing the best 32 teams in the continent battle for supremacy. It may not get as much attention as the Champions League, but for South American teams there is no bigger trophy. The tournament has reached semifinal stage, where Gremio and Cruzeiro from Brazil will clash with Argentina's Estudiantes and Uruguay's Nacional - a team captained by former Inter Milan star Juan Sebastian Veron. So with the action reaching a crescendo, it's high-time Fanzone explored what makes the compeition so great. History . The competition was first held in 1960, its name referring to the ""liberators"" who led South American countries in their wars of independence. For years it was dominated by Argentina, with a team from the country making it to every final between 1963 to 1979, and Buenos Aires team Independiente winning six times in that period. Since the early '90s, it's been the Brazilian clubs that have excelled. Brazil has provided 10 Libertadores finalists in the last 10 years, but since the tournament's inception, every country except Peru and Mexico has supplied a winner. Qualification . Under current quotas Brazil and Argentina both supply five teams for the tournament, while Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela are each represented by three teams, with the previous year's winner also qualifying. Each country has different qualifying criteria for its clubs but essentially, the  winners of South America's top domestic leagues, as well as some runners up, qualify for the Libertadores. They are joined by three teams invited from Mexico (which is not a member of CONMEBOL, the South American Football Confederation). Better than Europe? In terms of football quality, most would agree that the Libertadores struggles to match the Champions League and the reason is simple -- South American clubs simply don't have the money to hold onto their best players. Despite this, the Libertadores is still the place where some of the world's best players cut their footballing teeth. The likes of Ronaldinho and Carlos Tevez once shone in the Libertadores, as did past masters like Pele and Zico. Which do you think is better, the Copa Libertadores or the Champions League? Sound Off below. While the tournament may lack big-name players, in other ways the Libertadores is as every bit as tough as the Champions League. Alexander Bellos is the author of ""Futebol: the Brazilian Way of Life."" He told CNN that in the Libertadores, teams often have to travel huge distances for away matches. It can take a Brazilian club 24 hours to get to a match in Mexico, leaving little time for pre-match preparation or training. Some teams play their matches at high altitude, which can be a grueling experience for visiting teams not used to the thin air. Bellos says these factors can combine to make the Libertadores less predictable than the Champions League, as can the fact that clubs regularly lose their best players to Europe, meaning their squads can change drastically from one season to the next. As in the Champions League, big clubs, like Argentina's Boca Juniors and Brazil's Sao Paolo, usually make the final stages, but last year's winners were unheralded Ecuadorian club LBS Quito.","This year is the 50th birthday of South American football's Copa Libertadores .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- A funeral procession for a senior Iraqi Shiite leader wound through the streets of Tehran, the Iranian capital, on Thursday. Iraqi Shiite leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, seen in a 2007 photo, was an ally of both the U.S. and Iran. Mourners turned out to say goodbye to Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, who spent 20 years in exile in Iran before returning to Iraq after U.S.-led forces toppled Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The funeral procession started at the Iraqi Embassy in Tehran, said Haitham al-Husseini, a senior official with al-Hakim's office and one of his advisers. Iraqi and Iranian government officials attended the procession with senior religious figures and some members of the Iraqi parliament. Another funeral procession is scheduled to be held Friday in Baghdad, Iraq, before the casket travels to several parts of southern Iraq with large Shiite populations. Authorities are concerned about security since Sunni insurgents have targeted large Shiite gatherings in the past. The Iraqi government announced the start of three days of mourning on Thursday, according to state television in Iraq. Al-Hakim died Wednesday in Tehran after a lengthy battle with lung cancer. He was 59. He will be buried in his hometown of Najaf, one of the holiest cities for Shiite Muslims, al-Husseini said. U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Christopher Hill and the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. Ray Odierno, described him as ""a national hero"" in a joint statement that expressed sadness over the death. ""Throughout his life, His Eminence demonstrated courage and fortitude, contributing to the building of a new Iraq,"" the statement said. ""We offer our sincere condolences to his family and colleagues. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki also offered condolences, saying al-Hakim was ""like an old brother."" Al-Maliki credited him for being a ""strong supporter during the phase of fighting the ousted regime and a key figure in the process of building the new Iraq.""  Watch how al-Hakim helped shape Iraq's future Â» . ""His death at this critical stage that we are passing through is a great loss for Iraq,"" al-Maliki said. Al-Hakim ended his exile in Iran in 2003 when he returned to Iraq after Hussein and his regime were toppled. ""It was very emotional for me to meet with my people after Saddam fell,"" al-Hakim said in a 2006 interview. ""I was longing to see them, my goal in this life is to serve those great people and I am very proud to be a part of them."" Iraqi Shiites were suppressed under the Hussein regime, which favored the country's minority Sunni Muslims. Al-Hakim played a central role in shaping Iraq's future following his return. During his exile, which began in the early 1980s, al-Hakim commanded the Badr Brigades, the military wing of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, or SCIRI. SCIRI -- a religious opposition movement to the Hussein regime -- was led by al-Hakim's brother until he was assassinated in August 2003. Al-Hakim himself was also the target of assassination attempts. He took over as the head of SCIRI and began his ascent to power as the Badr Brigades became the bulk of the Iraqi security forces in Iraq's predominantly Shiite south. SCIRI changed its name to the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) in 2007 to remove the word ""revolution,"" in an effort to reflect the situation in Iraq. Al-Hakim had always propagated a message of peace, calling on Iraqis to stop taking part in the bitter sectarian conflict that followed the fall of Hussein. But despite his desire for a secular democracy in Iraq, he wanted a country that recognized the importance of religion, religious institutions and its authorities. Al-Hakim successfully harnessed the fervor generated from emotional religious rituals like Ashura, a national day of fasting, and turned them into a powerful political platform. That ability led some to consider him Iraq's most powerful man. His political bloc won the most seats in the Iraqi Parliament in 2005. And although al-Hakim never held a government position, he commanded respect from those who did. Government ministers would meet with him at his office, not theirs, and he was often seen in the company of former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad. And when talks on Iraq's constitution stalled, former President George W. Bush called al-Hakim, not the Iraqi prime minister or president. He visited the United States three times during the Bush administration to address the situation in Iraq. But al-Hakim remained artfully vague about Iran's influence in Iraq, saying its role was a positive one -- in direct contradiction to the U.S. government, which raised concerns about what it called Iran's ""meddling."" He said the two predominantly Shiite Muslim countries shared border, historical and cultural relations, and emphasized the desire for strong ties. Al-Hakim died at a time of violent political turmoil in Iraq. The power of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) party he leaves behind is just as uncertain as the nation he wanted to serve. Al-Hakim was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2007 and was first treated in the United States, then later in Iran. When he returned to Iraq later that year, he told CNN that he felt good. But it was around that time that it became apparent he was grooming his son, Ammar al-Hakim, to take over as head of ISCI. It was once Iraq's most powerful Shiite political party, but ISCI lost much of its influence following elections in January when politicians allied with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki won control of most of Iraq's provincial councils. CNN's Arwa Damon, Jomana Karadsheh and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Funeral procession for Abdul Aziz al-Hakim in Tehran; another set for Baghdad .

"URUMQI, China (CNN) -- Several hundred people staged a new protest in Urumqi on Tuesday, demanding the release of relatives detained in connection with weekend demonstrations by ethnic Uyghur residents in China's far western Xinjiang region. Ethnic Uyghur women grab the arm of a policeman as they protest in Urumqi on July 7. The crowd of 200 to 300 -- mostly women and elderly -- quickly formed as local authorities were taking members of the media on a tour of a neighborhood that was heavily damaged during riots over the weekend, witnesses said. Riot police quickly moved in to defuse the standoff as the demonstrators shouted the names of family members they wanted released. The protest is the latest sign that tensions are still simmering in the Xinjiang capital, where violent demonstrations have left 156 people dead and more than 1,000 injured, according to the regional public security department. In southern China, police have detained 15 suspects in connection with an incident that may have spurred the deadly rioting in Urumqi, state-run media reported. There is speculation that Sunday's protest, which took place in the predominantly Uyghur-populated Bazaar district, may have been a reaction to ethnic violence in southern China. The violence took place late last month at a toy factory in Guangdong province, where many migrants, including Uyghurs, have moved in search of work. A massive brawl reportedly broke out between workers of Uyghur and Han nationalities. Two Uyghurs reportedly died. The unrest in Urumqi had been brought under control with a massive presence of soldiers and anti-riot squads, the government said Tuesday. Curfews were in force in major districts of the capital. At least 1,434 suspects had been detained by Tuesday morning, the Xinhua news agency reported, citing government officials. ""The police have started interrogations with the suspects,"" said Li Yi, a spokesman for the Communist Party in Xinjiang. Those convicted would be dealt with severely, he said.  Watch more on violence in Xinjiang Â» . In a rare public display of dissatisfaction, thousands of Uyghurs -- many of whom feel they are treated as second-class citizens by the majority Han Chinese -- took to the streets Sunday chanting and screaming, prompting a police lockdown of the city. State-run media reported that protesters attacked passersby, burned public buses and blocked traffic. The report did not say how many people took part or what their grievances were. But a witness in Urumqi told CNN that, soon after the protest started about 5 p.m., hundreds of demonstrators ""grew into easily over 1,000 -- men, women and children, all ethnic Uyghurs -- screaming and chanting."" Police arrived quickly and tried to control the swelling crowd by erecting barriers in the street, but ""people pushed them over,"" the witness said. ""They were throwing rocks at passing cars and buses."" As the violence escalated, hundreds of riot police arrived, the witness said. ""They used tear gas and fire hoses to disperse the crowd. I saw fire trucks, ambulances, armed personnel carriers and what looked like tanks. I heard random gunshots."" iReport.com: Are you there? Share photos, video, commentary . Late Sunday, the witness said, Urumqi was in a lockdown, with hundreds of People's Liberation Army soldiers in the streets. He reported seeing riot police chasing protesters into alleys and rounding up many of them. Xinjiang is home to many Uyghurs. China's constitution guarantees ethnic minorities equal rights and limited autonomy. However, ethnic tensions run deep. Minority groups such as the Uyghurs complain that they are subjected to discrimination by the majority Han.  See a map of Xinjiang Â» . Tensions also ran high in Han communities in the capital on Tuesday as neighbors organized to protect themselves and their businesses. Groups of men carrying pipes, sticks and cleavers milled in front of shops before police dispersed them. ""The Uyghurs will attack any Han they see,"" one man said. The World Uyghur Congress, a dissident Uyghur group based in Munich, Germany, condemned the crackdown on what it described in a written statement as Sunday's ""peaceful protest"" by Uyghurs. ""The Chinese authorities should acknowledge that the peaceful protest was sparked by the unlawful mob beating and killing of Uyghur workers at a Guangdong toy factory more than a week ago,"" it said. ""The authorities should also acknowledge that their failure to take any meaningful action to punish the Chinese mob for the brutal murder of Uyghurs is the real cause of this protest."" It accused the Chinese authorities of having ""used tear gas, automatic rifles and armored vehicles to disperse the Uyghur protesters. During the crackdown, some were shot to death, and some were beaten to death by Chinese police. Some demonstrators were even crushed by armored vehicles near Xinjiang University, according to eyewitnesses.""  Watch victims describe the riots in Urumqi Â» . The government in Xinjiang blamed ""foreign forces"" for Sunday's rioting. ""The violence is premeditated, organized violent crime,"" said Nur Bekri, chairman of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, the equivalent of a governor. ""It was instigated and directed from abroad and carried out by outlaws in the country."" Bekri accused the World Uyghur Congress of spreading rumors and inciting anger that led to the rioting, in a speech carried by Xinjiang television. The World Uyghur Congress denied the charge. It is led by Rebuya Kadeer, a businesswoman of Uyghur ethnicity who was detained in 1999 and accused of harming China's national security. She was freed on bail in 2005 and was allowed to leave for the United States for medical care. Bekri accused Kadeer of instigating the unrest via the Internet and said the fight at the Guangdong toy factory was exploited to incite ethnic strife. Internet service was hard to come by in Urumqi on Tuesday. Reporters' BlackBerries could not send and receive messages. Computers could not access the Web at their hotels.","Hundreds protest mass arrests following ethnic unrest in China's Xinjiang region .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Actor Derek Mears has a big hockey mask to fill. Derek Mears arrives on the red carpet at the Hollywood premiere of the new ""Friday the 13th"" movie. Mears was cast as the iconic boogeyman Jason Voorhees in the new ""Friday the 13th"" movie. A remake of the original 1980 film, the new movie aims to breathe life into the former franchise about a psychopathic killer who preys on a group of young people at the fictitious Camp Crystal Lake. Mears is no stranger to the horror genre, having co-starred in ""The Hills Have Eyes II."" His career is extensive and includes stints as a stuntman in two of the popular ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films. He recently spoke to CNN about taking a turn as the ultimate evil, the thrill of continuing a slasher legacy and why he's really not that bloody nice. CNN: You aren't that scary in person, so what made you think you could be that scary on camera? Derek Mears: I've got a lot of issues. I've got a whole lot of daddy issues. No, I sound like a basket case. It's funny with acting -- we all wear masks in our normal life. Not to sound like a weirdo in the hockey mask, but like right now I'm really excited about the film and excited about playing the character, and I will start to speak faster. That's kind of what's coming over me: ""Oh you're, you're really nice,"" but ... on the other side of me there are other Dereks that are angry, and like I said before, have a little bit of issues. CNN: Tell me a little bit about how you were approached. Did you know they were making it before they came to you? Was it kind of a shock? Mears: It's so weird. There's two different versions. There's my version of how it went about, and there's the producer's version. I'll tell the producer's version because my version is really, really long. The short version of my version was I heard they were doing a new ""Friday the 13th,"" and I've never tried to pursue a role before and I went, I really want to do this. So when I heard they were doing it, before I even had an audition, I started training for it. I found out a little about what they wanted for the character -- that he wasn't going to be super, you know bulky or big, that he's more functional. He's still big, but he's lean. So I started training that way and trying to do what I could just to get an audition. On the other end, on the producer's end, they asked a bunch of different industry professionals. They said, ""Hey, were doing a new 'Friday the 13th.' Who do you think would be a great new Jason?"" And my name kept popping up, which I'm blown away by. They brought me in for an audition, and I met with them. and they called me the next day and went, ""OK, you're the guy."" And I still don't believe it till this day. I'm blown away. CNN: How did you keep it light on the set? Mears: Believe it or not, all the actors ... got along so well. I have never been so close to a cast before on set. We were just goofing around and playing, but then when it's time to work and get serious with certain scenes, we'd all switch over and do our job and get to the point where we needed to. CNN: Had you seen any of the original ""Friday the 13th"" movies? Mears: Oh yeah. I mean, I'm a fan. I consider myself a fan of the series. I already knew all of the originals. I had them all on DVD, and when I first met with Platinum Dunes [the production company behind the new movie], I told them, ""Hey look, I'm a fan of the series first and foremost. If I'm right for the part, fantastic. If I'm not right for the part, that's OK, too. I, just as a fan, want to see a good 'Friday the 13th' film. I want to see the series continue so if I can help it, awesome, but I just want to see something good."" CNN: Did you try to model your character after previous Jasons, or did you try to kind of take it and make it your own? Mears: Definitely make it my own. I used the script that Mark Swift and Damian Shannon wrote as a blueprint -- like you would for any acting role where I knew the other guys who've played ""Jason"" before, and what they've done, but you kind of shove that away somewhere deep in your brain and build your character from the new script. And there are times in the film here and there where I would do little tips of the hats or little homage for the guys who have played him before. CNN: It's kind of a dream come true. Mears: Yeah, that's why I keep saying the words this whole interview like ""unbelievable,"" unbelievable because I don't believe it. CNN: Which is funny. You don't usually think of such happiness and glee [on a horror movie set]. Mears: And trust me, you won't see that in the final product.

"Beijing, China (CNN)  -- China and the United States, the largest producers of greenhouse gases, will team up to fight climate change and create clean energy, their leaders said Tuesday. Chinese President Hu Jintao and President Obama said their nations will cooperate to advance technologies and work toward a global agreement on reducing carbon emissions. ""As the two largest consumers and producers of energy, there can be no solution to this challenge without the efforts of both China and the United States,"" Obama said. ""That is why we've agreed to a series of important new initiatives in this area."" What would you ask Obama? Share your question for CNN's interview . After Tuesday's meeting, Hu told reporters, ""We agreed to expand our cooperation on climate change, energy and environment,"" which includes developing a China-U.S. clean energy research center. The declaration by Hu and Obama comes ahead of next month's U.N. Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, and follows recent acknowledgment by the world's top economic powers, including the U.S., that there's no hope of a major breakthrough on climate change by year's end. The U.S. president said the two leaders want to accelerate the world toward a pact to cut greenhouse gases. The leaders did not offer a time frame, however. ""Our aim ... is not a partial accord or a political declaration,"" Obama said, ""but rather an accord that covers all of the issues in the negotiations and one that has immediate operational affect. ""This kind of comprehensive agreement would be an important step forward in the effort to rally the world around a solution to our climate challenge."" Instead of reaching a final deal in Copenhagen, a strategy dubbed ""one agreement, two steps"" was unveiled at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit over the weekend in Singapore. The aim is to produce a pact over a longer period. The first step would be to have all 191 countries involved in the Copenhagen summit signing on to a framework that includes key ingredients, such as how to finance the coordinated effort to battle climate change. The second step, a binding deal on cutting carbon emissions, would be hashed out in further negotiations. ""Opportunity is knocking. It is up to you to open the door,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement Monday. ""We must seize this opportunity to create a safer and more prosperous future for all, to reduce the emissions that are causing climate change and to help the most vulnerable adapt to impacts that are already under way."" Like the United States and China, APEC and Group of 20 leaders -- the world's leading economies -- have pledged to drive toward a climate-change agreement in Copenhagen. The conference, set to begin December 7, aims to strike a deal on a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 pact that has legally binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The United States never ratified it, though more than 200 other nations did.","President Obama, Chinese leader pledge to work to reduce carbon emissions .

"(CNN) -- Back in his native South Korea, the Korean Foreign Ministry nicknamed him ""Ban-chusa,"" meaning ""the Bureaucrat"" or ""the administrative clerk."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has focused on global warming policy by world governments. While Ban Ki-moon was known for his attention to detail and administrative skill, he was also seen by some as lacking in charisma and subservient to his superiors, while the Korean press called him ""the slippery eel"" for his ability to dodge questions. But on October 13, 2006, South Korea's Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon was elected to be the eighth Secretary-General by the United Nations General Assembly. Following up on a campaign aiming to bring out his charismatic side, Ban surprised the audience of a UN Correspondents' dinner that December by singing ""Ban Ki-moon is coming to town"" on the melody of ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town."" Ban was born on 13 June 1944. He received a bachelor's degree in international relations from Seoul National University in 1970, and a master's degree in public administration from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 1985. He and his wife, Yoo (Ban) Soon-taek, whom he met in high school in 1962, have one son and two daughters. In addition to Korean, Ban speaks fluent English and is studying French. Ban was the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of Korea from January 2004 to November 2006. His tenure included postings in New Delhi, Washington D.C. and Vienna, while he was responsible for a variety of portfolios such as Foreign Policy Advisor to the President, Chief National Security Adviser to the President, Deputy Minister for Policy Planning and Director-General of American Affairs. Throughout this service, his guiding vision was that of a peaceful Korean peninsula, playing an expanding role for peace and prosperity in the region and the wider world.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Nineteen U.S. troops were killed in Iraq in May, the fewest killed in any month since the war started. Baghdad saw a lull in violence in May, as a cease fire agreement has so far been maintained. The second-lowest month for American deaths was in February 2004, when 20 were killed. May's toll was a significant decrease from April, when 50 were killed -- the highest monthly figure since September. The U.S. military death toll spiked last year as the U.S. troop escalation, dubbed the ""surge,"" was unfolding. In 2007, there were 104 deaths in April, 126 in May and 101 in June. Numbers began dropping when the ""surge"" strategy took hold and Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr suspended the activities of his militia, the Mehdi Army. There were 78 American deaths in July, 2007; 84 in August; 65 in September; 38 in October; 37 in November; 23 in December; 40 in January; 29 in February; and 38 in March. May's death numbers appeared to support Senate testimony last month from Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Iraq. Petraeus said recent operations in three Iraqi cities have ""contributed significantly to the reduction in violence."" The month of June may not bring such optimistic news. A suicide car bomb struck an Iraqi police checkpoint outside police headquarters in Mosul on Monday, killing nine people, including four police officers, and wounding 46 people, a Mosul police official said.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- For most people life can be boiled down to a few major decisions and a list of truly memorable events. Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams hope love conquers all in ""The Time Traveler's Wife."" Typically, these are first words, first steps, graduations, births, weddings and -- of course -- marriage proposals. More than a few of these milestone moments take place in the new romantic drama ""The Time Traveler's Wife."" Of all of them, perhaps the most memorable is a scene in which Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) asks Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams) to be his wife. It's a complicated request because Henry, a kind man, also has the uncanny and often unfortunate ability to be transported suddenly and unexpectedly from one time period to another, leaving Clare on her own.

"(CNN) -- The Marine Corps has sacked four top officers of a California-based fighter squadron over the December crash of a fighter jet that slammed into a San Diego neighborhood, the service announced Tuesday. Grace Yoon, 15 months, was killed after a military jet crashed into her home. Deferred maintenance and faulty decisions by the pilot and squadron members with whom he was communicating on the ground contributed to the crash, a Marine Corps investigation concluded. The commander of the squadron involved, its top maintenance officer and two others have been relieved of duty as a result of the investigation, and nine other Marines have received other disciplinary action, Maj. Gen. Randolph Alles said. The jet crashed in the University City neighborhood of San Diego, about three miles short of the Miramar airfield. Two adults and two small children from a Korean immigrant family were killed when the jet slammed into their house.  Watch what pilot said as plane had trouble Â» . The F/A-18 Hornet crashed after ""a succession of emergencies"" that began with oil-pressure problems in its right engine during a flight off the Southern California coast, said Marine Col. John Rupp. That left the jet relying on its other engine, which previously had been giving mechanics electronic indications of a problem with its fuel-flow system, Rupp said.  Learn more about the jet Â» . Maintenance rules don't require immediate repairs for the problem, he said, but the squadron flew the jet 146 times before it eventually crashed because its left engine was starved for fuel. ""The end result was that the squadron elected to fly an aircraft that had a degraded fuel system on the left side of the aircraft,"" Rupp said. ""This is a critical point, and this was collectively questionable judgment on the part of the squadron's maintenance department."" The investigation criticized the pilot, who was being trained on the F/A-18, for not consulting a pocket checklist that outlined emergency procedures. While controllers aboard the aircraft carrier that launched the jet urged the pilot to land at a nearby Navy airfield at North Island, squadron officers relied on ""incorrect assumptions and inaccurate data"" to guide him back to the plane's base at the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station. ""No one in the ready room stated or understood the severity of the low fuel emergency at this time,"" Rupp said. ""This is a critical moment, and this is collectively bad decision-making by the duty officer, by the operations officer and by the squadron's commanding officer."" The pilot waited ""until the last possible moment"" to eject from the plane, bailing out at an altitude of just 400 feet, and attempted to steer away from homes on the ground before the crash, Rupp said. The pilot, whose name has not been released, is grounded pending further review, which Marine officers said was routine. Alles said the officer was an ""above-average"" pilot who ""just made a poor decision."" Dong Yun Yoon lost his wife, children and mother-in-law in the crash and another unoccupied house also was destroyed. Yoon said the victims were his daughter Rachel, who was born less than two months before the accident; his 15-month-old daughter Grace; his wife, Young Mi Yoon, 36; and her 60-year-old mother, Suk Im Kim, who he said had come to the United States from Korea recently to help take care of the children. In an emotional press conference in December, Yoon said he did not blame the pilot and urged the public to pray for him. ""I don't blame him. I don't have any hard feelings. I know he did everything he could,"" Yoon said at the time. ""Please pray for him not to suffer from this accident,"" Yoon said as he fought for composure.

"(CNN) -- For those of us who remember a time when many families didn't have color TV, a remote control or even video games, hearing the theme song from ""The Patty Duke Show"" -- ""They're cousins / Identical cousins, all the way"" -- takes us back to black-and-white television sets and split-screen special effects. Patty Duke says she has many fond memories of working on ""The Patty Duke Show."" ""Back then it was very crude, how we did split-screen,"" star Patty Duke said of playing the dual roles of Patty and Cathy Lane in the show, which was developed specifically for her. ""Now with all-digital applications, it looks antique. But the show's values are still what we want to impart on our children."" The first complete season of ""The Patty Duke Show,"" from 1963 to 1964, is now out on DVD. Duke told CNN that she's excited her five granddaughters will finally be able to see what ""Nana did when she was a teenager."" ""I am tickled, just tickled,"" she said. In the sitcom, which ran for three seasons on ABC, Patty was a rambunctious teenager who always managed to find herself in some kind of trouble; cousin Cathy was a demure, worldly Scottish teenager who came to New York to live with the Lane family to finish her schooling. Duke, who was not quite 17 when the series began, says it took a lot of energy to play two different characters. She preferred the quieter Cathy, ""because I thought she was dignified and gentle and rational. When it was time to be Patty, I would have to deal with my embarrassment of her stupidity."" Duke was already a successful actor by the time the sitcom debuted, winning an Oscar for 1962's ""The Miracle Worker"" just months before the show premiered. But she describes herself as sheltered. ""I was a very isolated teenager. When it came time to do some of the school dances [on the show], they had to bring in real teenagers to teach me how,"" she says. ""I didn't know the dances, didn't know the music."" She says, however, the show was a relief during what were troubled times for her. She wrote about her tormented childhood in her autobiography, ""Call Me Anna,"" discussing her struggles with mental abuse at the hands of her managers, which she says led to alcohol and drug addiction. She was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and she now helps others who have the disease. ""I believe that show [gave me] the tools that helped me survive through my youth until I got my diagnosis,"" Duke said. ""I think 'tormenting' is one of the most perfect words for what you feel [with bipolar disorder], because you have no control over it. I did occasionally, very occasionally, hear voices, but mostly my instincts were messed up: If it was dangerous, then I should do it."" The show, she said, ""was where I went for safety."" ""It was a troubled time on the personal level, but the show was never troubled,"" she said. She speaks fondly of her co-stars, especially William Schallert, who played her father, Martin Lane. ""He has always been able to make me laugh until I had to spit up,"" she said of the now 87-year-old actor. ""He was also a solid, solid figure to me and still is. To this day, the relationship has grown, and he is always there for me."" She remains close to the other surviving members of the cast, including Paul O'Keefe, who played her brother. Jean Byron, who played mother Natalie Lane, died three years ago. Duke was able to transition from child star to adult actor of stage and screen, and she even had a hit single, 1965's ""Don't Just Stand There."" After ""The Patty Duke Show,"" she played a drug-addicted alcoholic singer in ""Valley of the Dolls"" and won an Emmy for the TV movie ""My Sweet Charlie."" To date, Duke has won one Academy Award, three Emmys and two Golden Globes. Duke is also acting onstage in the musical ""Wicked"" in San Francisco, California. She plays the witch Madame Morrible, and though she finds the energy for eight shows a week a challenge, she loves the theater. ""To me, it is almost a religious experience, the exchange between those strangers out there in the dark and us,"" she said. ""To me, that's communication at its best, and that's really what I enjoy."" Duke says she lets little faze her. ""I've gotten to the age where I'm comfortable with just about everything -- except getting old!"" she said. Even there, she's willing to look at the situation without blinking. She teamed up with the Social Security Administration to do public service announcements encouraging seniors to sign up online -- using her old ""Patty Duke Show"" characters. ""On a positive side, I know about acceptance,"" she says. ""What's negative for me is all very superficial. The incredible lines in my face."" But she says the wisdom that comes with aging -- and, of course, maintaining a sense of humor -- helps her deal with that. ""Without a sense of humor,"" she said, ""I would have been gone a long time ago.""

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A New York Times reporter who was kidnapped last week was freed Wednesday in a pre-dawn military raid in Afghanistan that left a British commando, an Afghan journalist and several others dead. New York Times reporter Stephen Farrell was abducted Saturday while covering a NATO airstrike in Afghanistan. Stephen Farrell was rescued by NATO's International Security Assistance Force, known as the ISAF, the British Foreign Office said. A British commando died in the operation, the country's Ministry of Defense said without offering further details. Sultan Munad, an Afghan journalist accompanying Farrell, also was killed in the raid, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said. Crossfire during the raid also killed a woman and a child, said Abdel Wahid Omar Khil, governor of Kunduz district, in Kunduz province, where the rescue took place. Armed gunmen kidnapped the journalists Saturday while they were covering a NATO airstrike on Taliban forces the day before that killed at least 90 people in the northern Kunduz province. Neither CNN nor the Times had reported Farrell's kidnapping for security reasons. ""We feared that media attention would raise the temperature and increase the risk to the captives,"" the paper quoted Executive Editor Bill Keller as saying Wednesday. Farrell called the newspaper's foreign editor before dawn and said he was ""extracted"" in a commando raid after a fierce firefight, according to a report on the Times Web site. ""There were bullets all around us. I could hear British and Afghan voices,"" Farrell, a 46-year-old dual Irish-British citizen, told the paper. Farrell and Munadi ran outside during the firefight. At the end of a wall, Munadi went forward, shouting: ""Journalist! Journalist!"" but dropped in a hail of bullets, Farrell said. He didn't know whether the shots came from allied or militant fire. ""I saw him go down in front of me. He did not move. He's dead,"" Farrell told the paper. ""He was so close, he was just 2 feet in front of me when he dropped."" Farrell's citizenship played a role in the British decision to stage the rescue, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.  Watch a former British commander on the difficulty in rescuing hostages Â» . ""The obvious link for us is that Farrell is a British national. We want to safeguard the life of one of our citizens,"" the spokesman said, declining to discuss operational details of the rescue mission. ""We don't comment about the actions of British Special Ops forces."" Local Afghans provided information and helped the commandos locate where Farrell was being held, said another British official who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. He said the judgment to proceed with such an operation ""is always a difficult one, but we think it represented the best chance to save his life."" Brown offered condolences to the families of Munadi and the British commando. Of the commando, Brown said, ""His bravery will not be forgotten."" The operation to rescue the hostages happened after extensive planning and consideration, Brown said. ""Those involved knew the high risks they were running. That they undertook it in such circumstances showed breathtaking heroism,"" Brown said. ""Hostage-taking is never justified, and the U.K. does not make substantive concessions, including paying ransoms. But whenever British nationals are kidnapped, we and our allies will do everything in our power to free them."" Ten weeks earlier, another Times reporter escaped after months in Taliban captivity. David Rohde, a local reporter and a driver were kidnapped November 10 outside Kabul. The two reporters escaped on June 19 by climbing over a wall in the compound where they were held for seven months in Pakistan's North Waziristan region. The driver did not escape, the newspaper said. The death toll in the Kunduz airstrike, which Farrell was covering when he was kidnapped, has varied, depending on the source, but local Afghan officials have said at least half of those killed were civilians. The NATO commander in the area called in the strike Friday as Afghans tried to siphon fuel from two tankers hijacked by the Taliban a day earlier. The Taliban allowed villagers to drain the tankers carrying fuel earmarked for the NATO-led force after they became stuck in the mud when the militants tried to drive them through the Kunduz River. The military thought there were no civilians near the trucks at the time of the attack, the ISAF's Capt. Elizabeth Mathias said. Farrell, who joined The New York Times two years ago, also was briefly kidnapped in April 2004 in Falluja, Iraq. At the time, he was on assignment for The Times of London. In a separate incident Wednesday, a suicide attack killed at least two civilians and injured several others, including NATO personnel, near the main British military base in southern Afghanistan, the ISAF said. The suicide bomber detonated his explosives vest near a crowd of civilian truck drivers near the entrance of Camp Bastion in volatile Helmand province, the ISAF said. The injured civilians and ISAF personnel were treated at Camp Bastion, which is in Washir District. The casualty count is unclear as an investigation continues. CNN's Ingrid Formanek and Chris Lawrence contributed to this report.","NEW: Local Afghans helped British locate abducted journalist, official says .

"(CNN) -- Shortly after McDonald's celebrated its 30-year presence in France, the fast-food chain is conquering one of the country's most valued cultural institutions --the Louvre. McDonalds' burgers and fries will be available under the inverted glass pyramid of the Louvre. The restaurant will be serving its fast burgers in the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping mall which lies under the main entrance of the museum and which still contains an ancient wall that was discovered during construction works.  McDonald's' plans seem to have caused more media attention abroad than in France, but for some French outlets, the idea of combining fast food and ancient art is stomach churning. The Parisian Web site ""Louvre pour tous"" (Louvre for everyone) describes McDonald's' decision to open a restaurant in the prestigious museum as ""bad taste"" and blamed the Louvre's directors for failing to prevent what could result in ""fragrances of fries drifting under Mona Lisa's nose"". A spokeswoman for the museum told CNN it was not their decision and declined to comment further on the issue. The Carrousel du Louvre mall is managed by Unibail-Rodamco, Europe's largest property company, and not the museum itself. The mall, which is situated next to the most visited museum in the world, counts 8.3 million visitors a year and enjoyed a total gross sales of $75 million in 2008. Le Parisien, a daily newspaper described the difference between McDonald's and the Louvre by comparing Ronald McDonald, the restaurant's clown character, to Venus de Milo, the famous ancient Greek statue of Aphrodite, which is on display at the Louvre. Should McDonald's be in the Louvre? Tell us what you think in the Soundoff box below.  Museum lovers in France are shocked about the news, but not surprised. ""Museums have to offer services like restaurants and boutiques, it's completely normal,"" Jean-Michel Raingeard, President of the Federation of French Friends of Museums told CNN. What worries him, however, is the choice of shops. ""Museum directors seem to care more about the number of people they attract rather than the quality of people. Should a museum be a museum or an amusement park?"" asks Jean Michel Raingeard, who is also the European vice president for The World Federation of Friends of Museums. McDonald's sees the opening of its new restaurant next to the home of Mona Lisa as something completely normal. ""There are already many other restaurants in the mall, so we will only be one of the many restaurants that offer visitors their products."" says a spokeswoman for McDonald's in France. ""There's even a Starbucks,"" she added. Criticism, though fierce, has not been successful: the construction work will start soon and the restaurant should be open ""by the end of the year."" In spite of its location, the menu will very likely stay the same. ""McDonald's functions the same way in all of France, so there will probably be no special menus,"" the spokeswoman said.","McDonald's to open restaurant in the mall of the world's most visited museum .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It was against the terms of the Russia/Georgia cease-fire, brokered by France's President Nicolas Sarkozy. It was directly in contravention of the request not to do it from President George W. Bush of the United States. But Russia's President Dimitri Medvedev has gone and done it anyway. He has made Russia the first country to recognize the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Russian President Dmitri Medvedev says it has recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. So does that, as some of the more fevered commentators are suggesting, amount to a new Cold War? It certainly ratchets up the East-West tension still further. It breaks the terms of a cease-fire which insisted Georgia's territorial integrity should be respected. Russia's announcement that it will station troops in the two territories to ensure their ""security"", a word others might spell as ""subservience"", is a direct provocation. It is, says Georgia, an illegal ""annexation"". Other European nations have hastened to condemn it as an unacceptable rewriting of borders by force. What do you think of Russian recognition? U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, currently in the Middle East, points out that it is in contravention of U.N. Security Council resolutions that the Russians have accepted. Sarkozy has called a meeting of EU leaders for Monday to look at Georgia and at future relations with Russia. But before we start talking about a new Cold War -- and Western leaders from Bush down are being careful not to do so-- we should examine the context. After the military action initiated by Georgia early in August, there never was a chance that South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which have in effect been independent since the early 1990s, would return to control by Tblisi. Applying a blowtorch isn't necessarily the best way of settling what had become known as ""frozen conflicts"". Russia has long been in a position to bully and has now been given the excuse to do so. For years the two disputed territories have survived on Russian military and economic assistance. Although Abkhazia seeks fuller independence, a large number of South Ossetians, perhaps 70 or 80 per cent of them, have Russian passports and would vote for membership of the Russian Federation. Both disputed territories use the rouble. But this isn't, and never has been, just about Georgia. It is about the reassertion of regional power by a country which had smarted for years over the collapse of the Soviet Union and the eastward march of NATO, swallowing up former members of the Warsaw Pact. What we are seeing is a resurgent Russia currently prepared to strut the beach kicking sand in everybody's eyes and defying any affronted party to take them on. When NATO leaders met in the wake of the invasion of Georgia and came up with nothing more concrete than the ""suspension of normal relations"", the weakness of a divided West was all too obvious to Putin and Medvedev. They have now taken the next step down the line of provocation. ""Scrap the NATO-Russia Council altogether and see if we care!"" is the message. And, playing as the back-beat sub-theme through all this is the question of Kosovo, a question which looks very different according to whether you are seated in Moscow, Belgrade, Brussels or Washington. ""If it was right for the Kosovar Albanians to be given the right to declare independence from Serbia, then why shouldn't the people of South Ossetia be allowed to choose separation from Tblisi?"" demand the Medvedev-Putin supporters in the Russian Parliament. ""Ah yes,"" some say, ""but what about those threats from Moscow to turn Russian missiles against Poland now that the Poles have agreed to host the anti-missile batteries for the US missile defense plan? Isn't that a dangerous new escalation?"" Again, it depends where you are sitting. ""How would Washington like it if the Russians were to stage anti-missile batteries in Mexico?"" is Moscow's answer. What seems to be forgotten amid the current rhetorical battle is that the threats to make Poland a target for Russian missiles are nothing new. Before the G8 summit back in 2007, Putin got the world in a tizzy with precisely the same threats, at that stage being used to stir Polish domestic opposition to the idea of hosting the missile battery. In October 2007, Putin said the missile plan risked becoming a new Cuban missile crisis, probably the closest the world ever came to a nuclear war. Then, during an election, he threatened to point missiles at western Europe, walk away from a 1980s treaty limiting missiles and scrap a treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe (which Russia has since done). First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov, then seen as Putin's potential successor, threatened to site cruise missiles in Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave between Poland and Lithuania. General Nikolai Saltsov, then in charge of Russia's ballistic arsenal, said last December: ""I do not exclude the missile defense shield sites in Poland and the Czech Republic being chosen as targets for our intercontinental ballistic missiles."" The big problem for the West (and especially next Monday's meeting of EU leaders, who need to make a more effective job of it than NATO's foreign ministers did last week), is just how to respond to Russia's current bout of strutting without making things worse-- and how to do it without cutting off their own noses in the process. They could agree to make it harder for Russia to join the World Trade Organisation. They could even threaten to eject Russia from the G8. But what do they gain by doing so, especially those of them in the EU who depend on Russia for a hefty chunk of their energy supplies? For years the West has been trying to draw Russia in, not push it further out into the cold. They need Russia's cooperation on climate change, on fighting terrorism, on achieving peace in the Middle East and on curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions. And, let it not be forgotten, in keeping open NATO's supply routes for its mission in Afghanistan. The West is not ready to go to war over Russia's neighbors (or ""near abroad"" as Moscow terms it) but it does still have a role to play in the Russian economy. The EU may be dependent on Russian energy but it is also Russia's biggest customer. It should use the economic levers it has, refuse to allow the Russians to pick off individual members with bilateral deals and learn to use its collective strength in demanding common standards of its fellow G8 member. The worst thing it could do is to utter threats which it will not, or cannot, follow through.","Russian president signs order recognizing independence of Georgian territories .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Department of Homeland Security and FBI have issued security bulletins to raise awareness regarding ""terrorist interest"" in attacking sports and entertainment venues as well as luxury hotels. The bulletins, which were sent to law enforcement Monday, said that authorities did not know of any credible or specific terrorist plots to attack U.S. stadiums, arenas or luxury hotels. However, it said that terrorist groups such as al Qaeda view crowded stadiums and arenas as potential targets. It said hotels are also attractive targets for terrorists. The Department of Homeland Security said it released the notes to assist law enforcement partners as they go about their daily duties. ""While DHS and FBI have no information regarding the timing, location or target of any planned attack, we believe it is prudent to raise the security awareness of our local law enforcement partners regarding the targets and tactics of previous terrorist activity,"" the department said. The bulletins did not mention the recent arrest of three men in connection with what the Justice Department has said was a plot to detonate bombs in the United States. The men are charged with lying to federal agents during the probe of the alleged plot. The bulletin on stadiums and arenas said that previous attacks against crowd gatherings have included improvised explosive devices and car bombs, ""tactics that are also applicable to many stadiums and arenas. ... ""Detained terrorists have also discussed the use of aircraft and chemical weapons to attack stadiums and arenas. "" It said the al Qaeda training manual lists "" 'blasting and destroying the places of amusement, immorality and sin ... and attacking vital economic centers' as a key objective."" The bulletins on luxury hotels said analysis of previous attacks abroad and thwarted plots showed that terrorists have used paramilitary and ""small unit"" tactics, explosives, improvised explosive devices and car bombs. It said hotel owners can protect their properties by installing fencing or walls around the buildings and populated areas; implementing random screening of people and their possessions; and training security staff.","Department of Homeland Security and FBI issue security bulletins .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- An Al Qaeda-linked militant group waging war against Somalia's fragile government is becoming an increasing threat to Western ally Kenya and could potentially destabilize the region with dire consequences for global security, officials and analysts warn. Al-Shabab fighters count their bullets in neighborhood of Mogadishu. Al-Shabaab, one of the strongest Islamic militias battling for control of Mogadishu, has gained ground in recent weeks, according to officials, and has started to flex its muscles beyond Somalia's border with terror strikes, kidnappings and recruitment drives. They warn that unless the world takes action the group, which wants to impose an extreme type of Islamic sharia law, could extend its grip across parts of East Africa to gain control of a region that flanks busy shipping routes already plagued by Somali pirates . Appeals by Somalia's government for international help to unpick its long-running civil conflict have escalated Al-Shabaad's threats with the group behind warnings of an attack on the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. And, say experts, the group is being backed by foreign fighters -- some said to have links to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network -- a situation that draws direct comparisons with the group's influence in pre-9/11 Afghanistan. ""Al-Shabaab is a threat to the whole world,"" Somali Information Minister Farhan Ali Mohamoud told CNN. ""First to Somalia, to the neighborhood, and to everywhere they have disagreed with.""  Watch more on Somalian threat Â» . Mohamoud, whose transitional government has largely failed in its long-term goal of reconciling Somalia's militias, concedes Al-Shabaab is making major gains on his administration and says the global community must act to prevent their threat escalating. ""Somalia's problems are not for Somalia alone to solve. Not only for the African Union to solve. It is a global and regional issue. We are very appreciative that the international community understands that, but they need to act now, rather than later."" ""The issue is not Somalis taking over from other Somalis. But the issue is foreign jihadists imposing their ideas into the region. So Somalia can be a launching pad for a greater and wider jihadist issue."" Kenyan government spokesman Alfred Mutua told CNN his country did not yet fear direct attacks from Al-Shabaab but said it was becoming increasingly alarmed about its activities and its links to foreign networks. Despite the concerns, Mutua said the problem was nothing new and while his country struggled to exert control over its porous border with Somalia, it was taking steps to limit the danger. But he warned the threat was not limited to Kenya and could have global reach. ""We do believe that Al-Shabaab poses a threat, not only to Kenya, but to all neighboring countries such as Ethiopia and Eritrea,"" he said. ""It is not just a problem that we foresee in Kenya, just because we are neighbors to them, it is a problem that we foresee that may occur to a lot of countries and also poses a threat to outside even this region,"" he added. ""Our concern is not limited to Al-Shabaab. We know that Al-Shabaab are not able to do it without foreign intervention in terms of money and weapons that they are getting from other countries."" Ernst Jan Hogendoorn, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, told CNN that while Al-Shabaab had whipped up concerns with headline grabbing acts such as the recent kidnap of two French citizens in Mogadishu and three aid workers on the Kenyan side of the border, countries such as Kenya should pay heed. ""I think that Kenya could do a much better job. There is always the possibility that someone could sneak across the border and launch an attack against a soft target. Obviously Kenya has been the target of attacks in the past that are very, very challenging to prevent."" But, says Hogendoorn, with an African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia proving largely ineffective, and Ethiopian military presence withdrawn in January ahead of an Al-Shabaab push, Kenyan military involvement was unlikely to offer any quick fix. ""The problem is once [Kenyan troops] are on the ground they open themselves up to guerrilla style attacks and suicide attacks that could lead to significant loss in life.""","Experts, officials warn of growing threat from Somali militant group .

"LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- Investigators searched the Las Vegas home and office of Michael Jackson's personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, on Tuesday morning, a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman said. Investigators arrive at the Las Vegas, Nevada, home of Michael Jackson's personal physician. Los Angeles police and DEA agents, carrying search warrants, were ""looking for a lot of things,"" said Assistant Special Agent in Charge Mike Flanagan. Aerial cameras showed investigators leaving Murray's home, three hours after they entered, carrying several containers. The searches came a day after a source with knowledge of the investigation confirmed to CNN that Murray administered a powerful drug that authorities believe killed the singer. Flanagan said that while he could not disclose details of the search warrants, because a judge had ordered them sealed, he confirmed they were looking for documents and computer records. Murray's attorney, Ed Chernoff, issued a statement saying that officers from the DEA, Los Angeles police and ""various local agencies"" executed a search warrant at Murray's home and office beginning about 8 a.m. (11 a.m. ET) Tuesday. ""The search warrant authorized investigators to look for medical records relating to Michael Jackson and all of his reported aliases,"" the statement said. ""Dr. Murray was present during the search of his home and assisted the officers."" Investigators left Murray's home about noon, he said, taking cell phones and a computer hard drive. ""As of 2 p.m., the search at Dr. Murray's office continues,"" the statement said. Murray, a Texas-based cardiologist, allegedly gave Jackson the anesthetic propofol -- commonly known by the brand name Diprivan -- in the 24 hours before he died, said the source, who asked not to be named because the individual was not authorized to speak to the news media.  Watch a profile of Murray Â» . In a statement Monday, the doctor's attorneys said they wouldn't comment on ""rumors, innuendo or unnamed sources."" In the past, they have said Murray never prescribed or administered anything that could have killed Jackson.  Watch CNN's Ted Rowlands report on drug allegation Â» . Last week, Texas authorities searched Murray's Houston medical office and storage unit, looking for ""evidence of the offense of manslaughter,"" according to court documents. Among the items removed from Murray's office were a computer; 27 tablets of phentermine, a prescription-strength appetite suppressant; 1 tablet of clonazepam, an anti-anxiety medication; and some Rolodex cards. From Murray's storage unit, authorities removed two computer hard drives; an ""important contact list""; a suspension notice from Houston's Doctor Hospital; notices from the Internal Revenue Service; and a laundry list of medical and hospital documents. Chernoff, a Houston lawyer hired by Murray soon after Jackson's death, confirmed at the time that Los Angeles police detectives and federal DEA agents used a search warrant to enter Murray's office in northeast Houston on Wednesday morning. Chernoff said members of Murray's legal team were at the medical office during the search, which he said ""was conducted by members of the DEA, two robbery-homicide detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department and Houston Police officers."" Police have interviewed Murray twice since Jackson's death. A third interview was scheduled for July 24, but was postponed after the search warrants were executed. It's unknown when the next interview will take place. Among those who have indicated that Jackson may have been using dangerous prescription medication are nutritionist Cherilyn Lee, who said Jackson pleaded for the powerful sedative Diprivan despite being told of its harmful effects. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County coroner's office continues to investigate the cause of Jackson's death on June 25. It has been waiting on toxicology lab results, but a final autopsy report is expected as soon as this week, a coroner's spokesman has said. CNN's Ted Rowlands and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.","NEW: Doctor was ""present during the search of his home,"" attorney says .

"(CNN) -- If you sell it, they will come. Prices are expected to grow for Michael Jackson autographs like the one he gave this young fan in 2002. That's the hope at least for many offering Michael Jackson related merchandise and memorabilia, including autographed items and domain names, in the wake of his surprising death. Almost 20,000 items were up for sale after his death on the popular auction site eBay, where collectors could snap up everything from the rare to the ridiculous. Among the many T-shirts, record albums, DVDs and posters, there were also magazines about Jackson, dolls and copies of newspapers announcing his death. There were Michael Jackson gloves (sparkly, of course), masks, wigs, sunglasses and fedora hats. Anyone in the mood for some senior soda could try and win an auction for an unopened six-pack of Pepsi from the 1984 Jacksons world tour. For those seeking to establish Web sites, domain names were available including ""ILoveYouMichael.com,"" which was selling for the ""buy it now"" price of $5,000. Officials at eBay said that compared with the daily average of the week prior, Thursday's gross merchandise volume for Jackson memorabilia increased by 275 percent and sold items increased by 210 percent. New listings were up 61 percent, while the average selling price of items had increased by 31 percent. Online merchant CafePress also offered a variety of items, including mugs, ""R.I.P. Michael Jackson"" magnets and dozens of T-shirt designs, including one screened with a drawing of tennis legend Billie Jean King and the words ""not my lover."" Some of the hottest items may turn out to be the ones bearing Jackson's signature. On eBay, bids for what the buyer claimed was a signed Michael Jackson  guitar had reached almost $1,300 by Friday afternoon. Jerry Ohlinger, owner of Jerry Ohlinger's Movie Material Store in New York, predicted that although Jackson was generous in giving autographs, the price for a legitimate autograph probably will at least double from the $150 to $300 range it was prior to his death. ""He would sign autographs whenever he appeared in person,"" Ohlinger said. ""For instance, he visited our store at least three times, and he signed autographs for all of the employees."" As a comparison, Ohlinger said, an autograph for the late actress Marilyn Monroe, who also was known to sign a great deal during her lifetime, sells for about $5,000 because of great demand. As of Friday, items purported to be autographed photos of Jackson were ranging in price from just over $5 to several thousand dollars. There is no way to predict whether there will be a sudden influx in demand for Michael Jackson memorabilia and merchandise, Ohlinger said. All of the hoopla would probably tickle the pop icon, who Ohlinger said was himself a fan of star items. Whenever Jackson would visit Ohlinger's Manhattan store, he would shop for vintage photos of some of the legendary ladies of cinema, including his very dear friend Elizabeth Taylor, Ohlinger recalled.","NEW: Sold Jackson items on eBay increase 210 percent compared to last week .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Taliban leaders are holding Saudi-brokered talks with the Afghan government to end the country's bloody conflict -- and are severing their ties with al Qaeda, sources close to the historic discussions have told CNN. King Abdullah of Saudia Arabia hosted meetings between the Afghan government and the Taliban, a source says. The militia, which has been intensifying its attacks on the U.S.-led coalition that toppled it from power in 2001 for harboring Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, has been involved in four days of talks hosted by Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, says the source. The talks -- the first of their kind aimed at resolving the lengthy conflict in Afghanistan -- mark a significant move by the Saudi leadership to take a direct role in Afghanistan, hosting delegates who have until recently been their enemies. They also mark a sidestepping of key ""war on terror"" ally Pakistan, frequently accused of not doing enough to tackle militants sheltering on its territory, which has previously been a conduit for talks between the Saudis and Afghanistan. According to the source, fugitive Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar -- high on the U.S. military's most-wanted list -- was not present, but his representatives were keen to stress the reclusive cleric is no longer allied to al Qaeda. Details of the Taliban leader's split with al Qaeda have never been made public before, but the new claims confirm what another source with an intimate knowledge of the militia and Mullah Omar has told CNN in the past. The current round of talks, said to have been taken two years of intense behind-the-scenes negotiations to come to fruition, is anticipated to be the first step in a long process to secure a negotiated end to the conflict. But U.S.- and Europe-friendly Saudi Arabia's involvement has been propelled by a mounting death toll among coalition troops amid a worsening violence that has also claimed many civilian casualties. A Saudi source familiar with the talks confirmed that they happened and said the Saudis take seriously their role in facilitating discussions between parties to the conflict. A second round of talks is scheduled to take place in two months, the Saudi source said. The Afghan government believes the Taliban cannot be defeated militarily, and the Taliban believe that they can't win a war against the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan, the Saudi source said. The involvement of the Saudis is also seen as an expression of fear that Iran could take advantage of U.S. failings in Afghanistan, as it is seen to be doing in Iraq. Several Afghan sources familiar with Iranian activities in Afghanistan have said Iranian officials and diplomats who are investing in business and building education facilities are lobbying politicians in Kabul.  Learn more about King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia Â» . The Afghan sources wish to remain anonymous due to their political roles. Coalition commanders regularly accuse Iran of arming the Taliban, and Western diplomats privately suggest that Iran is working against U.S. interests in Afghanistan, making it harder to bring peace. Saudi sources say perceived Iranian expansionism is one of Saudi Arabia's biggest concerns.  Watch CNN's Nic Robertson report on the meeting Â» . The talks in Mecca took place between September 24 and 27 and involved 11 Taliban delegates, two Afghan government officials, a representative of former mujahadeen commander and U.S. foe Gulbadin Hekmatyar, and three others. King Abdullah broke fast during the Eid al-Fitr holiday with the 17-member Afghan delegation -- an act intended to show his commitment to ending the conflict. Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting.  Learn more about Ramadan Â» . Saudi Arabia was one of only three countries that recognized the Taliban leadership during its rule over Afghanistan in the 1990s, but that relationship was severed over Mullah Omar's refusal to hand over bin Laden. During the talks, described as an ice breaker, all parties agreed that the only solution to Afghanistan's conflict is through dialogue, not fighting. Further talks are expected in Saudi Arabia involving this core group and others.","King Abdullah hosted talks in city of Mecca at end of September, source says .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- The Los Angeles Times' headquarters aptly sits where the U.S. Army corralled camels during the Civil War, when Southern California was a desert with no natural resources. A new film on PBS explores how the Chandler family helped develop Los Angeles through their newspaper. Los Angeles' development from an arid wasteland to a world metropolis and cultural capital is closely linked to the newspaper's rise under the ownership of one family. ""It would still be a desert,"" documentary filmmaker Peter Jones said, if Gen. Harrison Gray Otis didn't arrive in the 1880s to take over the bankrupt Los Angeles Times and his son-in-law, Harry Chandler, wasn't there to follow him. Jones' documentary is a saga of four generations of the region's most powerful family shaping Los Angeles as they pursued their own civil agendas -- and accumulated wealth. ""Inventing L.A.: The Chandlers and Their Times"" premieres Monday on PBS. Historian David Halberstam said in the documentary that the Chandlers dominated Southern California as no other family has dominated any major region of the United States. ""They did not so much foster the growth of Los Angeles as invent it,"" said Halberstam, who died in 2007. Harrison Gray Otis, Harry Chandler, Norman Chandler and Otis Chandler succeeded each other at the helm of the Los Angeles Times over a span of 100 years. The city grew from a small desert town to the nation's second-largest city, while the family became one of the nation's wealthiest. The Chandler family dynasty ended when the general's great-grandson Otis Chandler was ousted as chairman of the Times board of directors in 1985. The family eventually sold its Times-Mirror Company to Chicago's Tribune Company -- which is now in bankruptcy. Each man's personality and strengths were tailored for what was demanded of their time, said Jones. ""For each era, they were up to that particular era,"" he said. ""You couldn't actually rearrange them,"" said Harry Chandler's namesake and the great-great-grandson of the general. ""You couldn't have a General Otis in late 20th-century America,"" Chandler told CNN, referring to the dynasty's founder who served as an Army general in the Philippine-American War before taking over the Los Angeles Times. ""His character was one of the period. 'I have a vision and everything I touch needs to support that vision and damn the consequences.'"" Otis used his newspaper to scare the public about the threat of drought, drumming up support for a 230-mile aqueduct -- one of the modern engineering marvels -- to divert water from the Owens Valley to Los Angeles, Jones said. He was part of a syndicate that bought vast tracts of barren land in the San Fernando Valley with the inside knowledge the Los Angeles Aqueduct would bring water there. The scandal later inspired Roman Polanski's award-winning film ""Chinatown."" Otis also used the Times to influence the federal government's decision to build the Port of Los Angeles, Jones said. ""He had the foresight to say 'We have to build a man-made harbor here in Los Angeles if we want to become a major port of trade,' and today the Port of Los Angeles is the busiest port in the United States,"" Jones said. The general and his successor son-in-law promoted investment in and migration to the Los Angeles area with stories of sunshine and opportunity. More people moving in meant more readers for their newspaper and demand for the real estate empire they were building. Harrison Gray Otis and Harry Chandler used their newspaper to create a vision of Los Angeles as ""America's Great White Spot"" -- free of crime and communism. They fought a decades-long battle against labor unions -- a battle that included the 1910 bombing of The Los Angeles Times headquarters. The Los Angeles film, aviation, high technology, shipping and oil industries grew from the Chandlers' influence, Jones said. As a conservative Republican family, they helped launch Richard Nixon's political career in post-World War II California. The story is not all about the men. Dorothy Chandler -- the strong-willed wife of Norman Chandler -- waged a relentless campaign to turn Los Angeles into a world-class cultural center, Jones said. She led a campaign to raise money to save the Hollywood Bowl and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. In doing so, she brought together the Westside Jewish community with the white Protestant establishment based in Pasadena, Harry Chandler said. Tom Johnson, who became first nonfamily publisher of the Times in 1980, said one of Dorothy Chandler's ""most remarkable"" contributions was the successful effort to make sure her son Otis succeeded her husband as publisher in 1960. ""The very new approach that Otis took and his leadership of the newspaper was just astounding,"" Johnson said in an interview with CNN. Otis Chandler gave reporters editorial independence, opened news bureaus around the world and strengthened the paper's coverage of the suburbs, Johnson said. Under Otis Chandler, it rose from being one of the worst major papers in the country to being one of the top three, Johnson said. ""It was his goal to make the Los Angeles Times one of the best newspapers, and he did it in 20 years, being the right publisher at the right time,"" Johnson said. But Otis Chandler's transformation of the Times from a conservative newspaper into a Pulitzer Prize-winning rival to the New York Times and Washington Post angered many Chandler family members. ""Some Chandlers were members of the John Birch society; his paper did an expose on it,"" Johnson said. Otis Chandler's newspaper looked closely at the Los Angeles Police Department, ""which had a reputation to shoot first and ask questions,"" Johnson said. The deep family rift eventually led to the sale of the Times-Mirror Company to the Tribune Company -- and the end of the dynasty. Johnson, who left the newspaper in 1989 and later became chairman of CNN, said the paper declined in the years since because ""rather than going for people who were superb newspaper people, they went outside to pick people who, in my opinion, blew the place apart."" Some Chandler family descendants cooperated with Jones' efforts to explore the Chandler family's dealings. ""He doesn't whitewash, but he doesn't dig into the dark side and linger too long,"" said Harry Chandler, the son of Otis Chandler. The documentary is ""on whole, a very balanced, very accomplished, incredibly well researched"" documentary, Chandler said. Jones said he avoided judging the motives of Gen. Otis and his successors. ""When these guys were going about building the city, sometimes they did things, I wouldn't say in an underhanded way, but in a very private way,"" Jones said. ""How do you ascribe motives to people who did things 100 years ago? Was it for greed, avarice and duplicity? History in general is this tangled web of good and evil.""","""Inventing L.A.: The Chandlers and Their Times"" premieres Monday on PBS .

"(CNN) -- Actor Edward Norton already wanted to be in better shape for his 40th birthday than he was on his 30th when the idea hit -- why not join members of an African tribe famous for its runners and run the New York marathon? ""Incredible Hulk"" star Edward Norton, second from left, has trained for a marathon with Maasai tribesmen in Kenya . Before he knew it, the star of ""The Incredible Hulk"" and ""Fight Club"" had signed on to the effort, despite never having run a marathon before. ""The idea picked up traction pretty quickly,"" said Norton, who turned 39 in August. ""Then, I was like, 'Wait a minute. What have I just done?'"" The run is a benefit for the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust, an organization working to promote sustainable development while protecting the east African grasslands that the Maasai tribe calls home. Both the traditional tribe's way of life and its environment have been threatened by rapid industrial development. Norton discovered, and became a supporter of, the trust about 10 years ago during his first visit to Kenya, where he met founder Luca Belpietro. ""I was impressed at the way he was really genuinely working with the community to create value out of being good stewards of the land,"" Norton said. Belpietro will be one of nearly 30 runners joining Norton on the Nov. 1 marathon. Also running will be magician David Blaine and three Maasai tribesmen. The Maasai are at the heart of Kenya's long tradition of distance running. Norton said one of the runners, safari guide Parashi Ntanin, is so fast he could probably leave the rest of the group behind and run the race in less than 2Â½ hours. Norton said he's run as much as 15 miles twice during his training for the 26.2-mile marathon and that despite some leg and knee pains, he's confident he'll finish the endurance race. ""I'm really enjoying it,"" he said after a workout Wednesday in New York. ""I'm enjoying having a goal."" A competitive rower at Yale, Norton said he's experienced the so-called ""runner's high"" during his training, which fans can follow on his Twitter account, @EdwardNorton. ""Running in the park, I got a taste of what people say about the New York marathon. There were people of every shape and size out there,"" he said. ""I really got a lift out of it."" Norton's latest film, the independently produced ""Leaves of Grass,"" is set to premiere this week at the Toronto International Film Festival and his company's ""By The People: The Election Of Barack Obama,"" a documentary about President Obama's historic campaign for the White House, debuts on HBO on November 3.","Actor on marathon decision: 'What have I just done?'

"(CNN) -- Formula One cars are a marvel of modern engineering, so much so, that many manufactuers who compete in the sport do so in order to benefit from the technical innovations race-honed research and development creates. Car builders such as Renault, Ferrari, BMW, Toyota and McLaren have used technology -- developed to make single-seater race cars as competitive as possible -- to enhance their road-car products. And who can blame them if you consider the performance such a machine can deliver to a driver? The average F1 car can reach 160km/h in under six seconds according to the official Formula One Web site and have top speeds in the region of 370 km/h. Going fast is one thing, stopping is another, and controlling such velocity requires carbon brakes which, in any given race, will have an operating temperature that is over 600 degrees Celsius. In general, the cars weigh around 600 kilograms in race trim, including the addition of KERS that some constructors use to increase performance. This system stores energy normally lost through braking and reuses it for speed boosts during the race. Watch out for KERS powered cars -- including the Mclarens, BMW Saubers and Renault -- using their boost as the lights go green to start this weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.","A Formula One car can reach 160km/h in under six seconds .

"London, England (CNN) -- The X-ray machine was Wednesday named the most important scientific invention, in a poll marking the centenary of the Science Museum in London. Almost 50,000 people voted in the museum or online on a shortlist of ten discoveries and inventions from past centuries in science, technology and engineering. The X-ray machine, which was discovered in 1895 and revolutionized how doctors detected disease and injury, struck a chord with most voters who singled it out for having made the greatest impact on the past, present and future. It gathered one fifth of the votes( 9581 votes) followed by the discoveries of penicillin and the DNA double helix structure. Katie Maggs, associate curator of medicine at the Science Museum, told CNN that she was ""pleasantly surprised"" with the results, saying she ""wondered whether the therapeutic benefit of penicillin might just edge in front -- or perhaps the Apollo 10 capsule as visitors find space travel so inspirational as the ultimate test of technology."" Maggs attributed the X-ray machine's popularity to the wide impact it has on people's everyday life, from the very first steps of a medical diagnosis to security control at airports. ""People are just fascinated with seeing inside their bodies --- even today. It has fundamentally changed the way we see and understand our world -- but particularly our bodies. ""But I also think visitors are aware of the immense and various benefits x-rays have brought -- revolutionizing medical diagnosis and therapy but also astronomy and material and chemical science -- it was x-rays that enabled us to discover the structure of DNA after all!"" X-rays were discovered in November 1895 by German physicist Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen. The Science Museum also houses the Reynolds machine, which was built by a father and son John and Russell Reynolds, months after RÃ¶ntgen announced his discovery.  They were so inspired by the news that they started constructing the equipment in their own home.","The X-ray machine was voted the most significant scientific invention, in a poll by the Science Museum in London .

"Editor's note: Virg Bernero is the mayor of Lansing, Michigan and chairman of the Mayors and Municipalities Automotive Coalition (MMAC). He is one of the mayors of U.S. cities appearing on ""American Morning"" this week. Mayor Virg Bernero says the American worker has been sold out by backers of free trade. (CNN) -- While America reels from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, it is time that we take a deeper look at the root causes of our current predicament. The cold, hard truth is that the unholy alliance between Washington and Wall Street has sold out the American worker and exported our standard of living. Driven by the insatiable greed of Wall Street profiteers and accelerated by the false promise of free trade, our manufacturing base has been chased out of this country and along with it the livelihood of millions of hard-working Americans. It's fashionable these days among the politicians, pundits and so-called experts to claim that free trade is actually good for us. They say it enables us to buy cheaper goods made with cheap foreign labor and this, in turn, raises our standard of living. With all due respect, the free traders need to ask themselves a more fundamental question: how will Americans buy those goods when they don't even have a paycheck that covers their mortgage, much less the college tuition for their children?  Watch Mayor Bernero speak to American Morning's John Roberts Â» . More than one pundit has told me I need to take a broader view. As the mayor of one of America's countless manufacturing communities, the only view that matters is the one my citizens see every day: Record job losses, home foreclosures and, thanks to the Wall Street wizards, a credit crunch so severe that it is nearly impossible to finance a new car. This isn't a predicament faced just by Michigan or the Midwest. This is the story of America, told in thousands of desperate households from Connecticut to California. The pundits claim our manufacturing sector is a relic of the old economy. We're told that we just can't compete anymore. We're told that our future is in the service economy, that jobs in health care and finance and knowledge-based industries will recreate the prosperity our nation once knew. The truth is that our industrial heritage is an example of everything that was right with our nation's economy. Good jobs with good benefits created the middle class in this country, and now it is being systematically dismantled under the banner of free trade and globalism. Those who continue to espouse free trade ominously warn that protectionism is the wrong path for our nation; that challenging the holy doctrine of free trade invites a global trade war. Yet we already face rampant protectionism across the globe. Pursuing a free trade agenda in a protectionist world is tantamount to unilateral disarmament. Our trading partners routinely employ taxes, tariffs and subsidies that underwrite their exports and restrict American products from entering their home markets. They use currency manipulation to reduce the relative cost of their goods here in the USA. The fact is we're not competing against other companies; we're competing against other countries. I've toured the Hyundai plant in Asan, Korea. The Koreans are wonderful people, but their technology isn't any better and they're not working any harder than Americans. The difference is that Hyundai doesn't have to pay legacy costs. The Korean government takes care of their retirees. Hyundai doesn't pay health care costs because they have national heath care. If you don't think that's an unfair advantage, you're kidding yourself. Many Americans are unaware that China sold 10 million cars last year -- more than General Motors or Toyota. I can assure you the Chinese government is part and parcel of that success. They're involved in their industry. The Korean government is involved in their industry. If we are going to have any chance to compete globally, our government must get involved in our industry and help us rebuild America's industrial might before it is too late. There's no question that we need this stimulus package. We need the reinvestment in America's infrastructure and in the working people of this country. We need tax cuts delivered directly to the American worker. We need education and retraining for the ""green collar"" jobs of the future. But we need more than a short term shot in the arm. We need a long-term strategy to rebuild the American economy that provides jobs and economic security to the millions of hard-working American families who have been sold down the river by unfair trade policies. We need fair trade agreements so that the most productive workers in the world -- American workers -- can put their skills to work and compete in the global economy. We recently watched our athletes successfully compete in the Olympics against nations of the world. When the playing field is level, Americans can compete against the best from any nation. With fair trade instead of free trade, American workers can once again bring home the gold. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Virg Bernero.","Virg Bernero: Washington and Wall Street have sold out the American worker .

"(CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama spoke with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Saturday about the violence in Gaza, which has left as many as 225 people dead, two transition aides told CNN. Barack Obama's approach to the Middle East as president will be the subject of much scrutiny. ""The president-elect appreciated the call and the information from Secretary Rice,"" one aide said, adding that Obama initiated the eight-minute phone call. ""He will continue to closely monitor these and other global events."" Israeli airstrikes pounded targets in Hamas-ruled Gaza on Saturday and continued into the night, retaliating against Palestinian militants who have been escalating rocket attacks against southern Israel. The fighting ignited eight days after a six-month Egypt-brokered cease-fire between Hamas and Israel expired. Obama has pledged to make Middle East peace a priority from the beginning of his presidency. Arabs are calling for a more even-handed approach than the Bush administration, but Israel is expecting Obama to stay true to the pro-Israel posture he showed during the campaign. But one analyst of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict cautioned against putting ""dangerously high"" expectations on the incoming administration. ""I think the tone of American politics will change: You're going to get a serious effort on behalf of the new administration,"" said Aaron David Miller, a public policy scholar at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson International Center and a former adviser to six secretaries of state on Arab-Israeli relations. But, he told CNN, ""the fact is that unless the Israelis and Palestinians are prepared -- which they're not right now -- to take the political decisions required to overcome the gaps and to sell an agreement to their respective constituents, there's not much a new president, no matter how bold or charismatic he may be, is going to be able to do about that.""

"(CNN) -- Flooding and resulting landslides killed 137 people Thursday and Friday in this nation's northern provinces, including Baguio City, Benguet Province and Mountain Province, the Office of Civil Defense in Cordillera said Friday. A boatman transports three empty wooden coffins on the edge of Laguna Lake east of Manila on Thursday. Another 43 people were missing and 45 were injured, it said. Landslides blocked traffic along the Marchos Highway, Naguilian Road, Kennon Road and Ambuklao Road, cutting access to Baguio City, Benguet Province and Mountain Province, it said. The floods were unleased by tropical depression Parma, which had been downgraded from a typhoon. Earlier reports from Rocky Baraan, provincial administrator of Pangasinan, said flooding had inundated 32 towns and two cities, Dagupan and Urdaneta. Some 35,000 people had fled to evacuation centers, the official Philippines News Agency reported, citing the Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council. The worst-hit areas included Bayambang, Alcala and Basista, the news agency reported. People clambered onto rooftops as floodwaters rose, calling and texting for help. Rescue trucks were hampered by floodwaters that reach the roofs of single-story houses, Baraan said. About 16 rubber rescue boats had been deployed. Since the rains started in central Luzon, three dams in the Pangasinan area have been releasing vast amounts of water -- up to 10 million cubic meters per hour at one dam, dam officials said. Water passing through the three dams -- the Ambuklao, the Binga and the San Roque -- is rushing into the Agno River, which has been swollen since Thursday and affects seven towns in eastern Pangasinan, dam officials said. Water released from the San Roque dam has contributed to the flooding in eastern Pangasinan, acknowledged Alex Palada, division manager for flood forecasting and warning of the National Power Corporation. Dam officials had no choice but to maintain safe water levels, he added, noting that he alerted Pangasinan Governor Amado Espino. The governor started to evacuate residents Thursday when the Agno River started to rise, Palada said. In the last several days, water has become the Philippines' biggest enemy, as Parma, locally known as ""Pepeng,"" dumped as much as 36 inches (91.4 centimeters) of rain in some parts of the nation of islands, compounding misery in areas already flooded by earlier storm Ketsana. Parma was forecast to have winds of no greater than 39 mph (63 kph) by Friday. The U.S. Navy was expected to join rescue operations in Pangasinan, according to the agency. Journalist Lilibeth Frondoso and CNN's Judy Kwon contributed to this report.","137 people dead in provinces, including Baguio City, Benguet and Mountain .

"LONDON, England -- Graffiti artist Banksy, famed for infiltrating museum collections without their knowledge and spray-painting public buildings around the world, is holding his first major exhibition in years. A Banksy painting of the British House of Commons at England's Bristol museum. This time, however, the anonymous artist worked in tandem with the director of Bristol museum in the UK. CNN's Max Foster got a preview of his largest project to date. The artist's anonymity gained him notoriety and he became one of the art world's biggest names with his works selling at auction for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The exhibition's range, while very varied, remained true to Banksy form with his usual unconventional take on art.  See pictures from Banksy's exhibition Â» . ""I think we might have dragged them down to our level rather than being elevated to theirs"" Banksy, who is thought to be from Bristol, said about the museum. He filled three stories of the building with his art in 36 hours under tight security, as only a few museum staff were aware of the shows' imminent arrival. His work is hidden among the museum's usual exhibits and is split into different rooms, including installations, paintings and sculptures. In one of the paintings, a character has been cut out and is instead sitting on the painting's frame, perhaps taking a break from posing? Another piece, which at first glance, looks like a copy of an ancient classical statue, is in fact a woman over-loaded with countless shopping bags as she browses for yet another item. Perhaps the most controversial, yet equally light-hearted piece, is a painting of the British Parliamentary House of Commons, filled with chimpanzees who are looking surprisingly ""ministerial."" ""You paint a hundred chimpanzees and they call you a guerilla artist,"" Banksy said. While one of the more poignant installations is that of Tweety, the Warner Bros. animated character famous for his upbeat personality and energy, looking old and life-less. ""This show is my vision of the future,"" the artist said . Banksy is unlikely to show up at the exhibition as he attempts to retain his anonymity. But while we may never know his identity, with this latest show, Banksy has definitely shown yet another facet of his personality.

"GAZA CITY, Gaza (CNN) -- Palestinian militants declared Sunday that they would stop attacks on Israel for a week, a statement that came hours after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert announced a unilateral cease-fire in the country's assault on Hamas in Gaza. An Israeli soldier holds up an Israeli flag after leaving Gaza on Sunday. The Palestinians demanded that Israel remove all troops from Gaza within the week, Hamas spokesman Ayman Taha said from Egypt. The agreement appears to cover all Palestinian armed factions, not only Hamas. ""We in the Palestinian resistance movements announce a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip,"" Moussa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official in Syria, said on Syrian TV. ""And we demand that Israeli forces withdraw in one week and that they open all the border crossings to permit the entry of humanitarian aid and basic goods for our people in Gaza."" There is no mutual agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians -- each side has made its own unilateral declaration of a cease-fire. Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, called for the cease-fire to hold so aid could get into Gaza.  Watch how a family in Gaza is coping with the violence Â» . ""We hope that it continues and that the situation calms down and that humanitarian aid delivery begins immediately to our people,"" he said at a summit in Egypt.  Watch how a reporter finds Gaza in chaos Â» . During 22 days of fighting, more than 1,200 people have died, all but 13 of them Palestinians.  Watch clean-up efforts in Gaza City Â» . The Palestinians and Israel continued to skirmish for several hours Sunday after Israel said it was stopping its offensive against Hamas. Palestinians fired at least 19 rockets into Israel on Sunday -- including at least two after the Palestinian cease-fire declaration, according to Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld. At least three people were lightly wounded. Israeli military aircraft retaliated, firing missiles and destroying a rocket launcher, a military spokesman said. Shortly before the rocket attacks, Palestinian gunmen opened fire on Israeli forces in northern Gaza, the military said. Troops returned fire. Separately, Palestinian medical sources said 23 bodies were pulled from rubble in Gaza.    Watch doctors tend to wounded civilians Â» . Olmert said Sunday the Israeli offensive had achieved its goals but that the Israel Defense Forces reserved the right to respond to any Palestinian violence against Israelis. ""IDF forces are in the Gaza Strip and many other units, which are surrounding Gaza from all sides, are closely observing every corner and listening to every whisper, ready for any response that they might receive from their commanders if and when the violations continue, as they have this morning,"" he said at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, before the announcement of the Palestinian cease-fire. Israel pulled some troops out of the Palestinian territory as it called a halt to its operation against Hamas, but others remained. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN they would be there for a matter of days, not weeks. International leaders are in the region for talks on the crisis. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and French President Nicolas Sarkozy hosted a summit Sunday in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, bringing together leaders from Europe and the Middle East. Olmert told the gathering that, if the cease-fire holds, ""the government of Israel has no intention to stay in the Gaza Strip. We are interested in leaving Gaza as soon as we can."" He said Israel would ""continue to do whatever is possible to prevent the humanitarian crisis in Gaza,"" and expressed sorrow for the deaths of innocent civilians. ""It wasn't our intention to fight them or to harm them, to hurt them or to shoot at them,"" he said. German Premier Angela Merkel underscored the international community's preferred outcome in a news conference in Egypt: ""The two-state solution is the only solution we have."" Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert will meet the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic, which  holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, later in Jerusalem. A top aide to Barack Obama said the president-elect would move swiftly to work on the Middle East after he is sworn in on Tuesday. ""The events around the world demand that he act quickly, and I think you'll see him act quickly,"" David Axelrod told CNN. But he refused to promise Obama would name a Middle East special envoy ""on day one."" Israel said it launched the offensive in Gaza to stop the firing of rockets -- primarily the short-range homemade Qassam rockets -- from the territory into southern Israel by Hamas fighters. ""We welcome any alleviation of violence, with cautious optimism and hope that these declarations of cease-fire will lead to the end of fighting,"" said Charles Clayton, national director of World Vision Jerusalem, an aid group. ""We call on all parties to stop attacks, including Hamas' rocket strikes against Israel, and refrain from further hostilities."" He called for ""unhindered and safe humanitarian assistance to the desperate civilian families of Gaza who have lost their homes and businesses and are struggling amid shortages of food, supplies, healthcare and fuel."" He further called for an end ""to the 18-month blockade of the 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza,"" saying it has ""devastated the economy, halted services, and rendered the people of Gaza entirely dependent on humanitarian aid.""

"(CNN)  -- The Cuban government, long the object of a U.S. economic blockade, is prepared to meet with the Obama administration, Cuba's leader said. RaÃºl Castro says Cuba is willing ""to discuss everything -- human rights, freedom of the press, political prisoners.'' ""We've told the North American government, in private and in public, that we are prepared, wherever they want, to discuss everything -- human rights, freedom of the press, political prisoners -- everything, everything, everything that they want to discuss,"" Cuban President RaÃºl Castro said Thursday at a summit of leftist Latin American leaders in Venezuela. The response came days after President Obama lifted all restrictions on the ability of American citizens to visit relatives in Cuba as well as to send them remittances. Travel restrictions for Americans of non-Cuban descent will remain in place. This week's move represents a significant shift in a U.S. policy that had remained largely unchanged for nearly half a century. The U.S. government instituted the embargo three years after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. In Mexico City for meetings with Mexican President Felipe Calderon, Obama offered a carrot and a stick to Havana. ""What we're looking for is some signal that there are going to be changes in how Cuba operates that assures that political prisoners are released, that people can speak their minds freely, that they can travel, that they can write and attend church and do the things that people throughout the hemisphere can do and take for granted,"" he said. ""And if there is some sense of movement on those fronts in Cuba, then I think we can see a further thawing of relations and further changes.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Layoffs for sea lions? Furloughs for frogs? Is there no job security, anywhere? State budget cuts mean New York's 76 zoos, botanical gardens and aquariums will lose $9.1 million in funding. The recession may be coming to a zoo near you. State budget cuts mean many zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens will lose crucial state funding for their exhibits. New York's 76 zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens will lose $9.1 million in state funds next year. ""We're faced with this very difficult problem of firing the animals, as it were,"" said Steve Sanderson, the CEO of the Wildlife Conservation Society, which manages the Bronx Zoo and the New York Aquarium. They will lose $3 million to budget cuts. The Bronx Zoo has made a short video posted on its Web site www.bronxzoo.com/ to draw attention to the cuts. In the video, the zoo director fires a porcupine and a frog. ""I am sure you have heard that Gov. [David] Paterson's proposed budget will mean severe cuts here at the Bronx Zoo and the New York Aquarium,"" the zoo director says. ""Next year, all 76 zoos, botanical gardens and aquariums in the state will lose all of their state funding. There is no easy way to say this: Even though you bring record numbers of people to New York and help the economy, we are going to have to let you go."" Firing a porcupine and a frog may be a cute way to get publicity for their budget woes, but it's a serious matter and zoo officials say the recession will certainly affect the animals. Zoo officials say some collections with ""short life cycles"" will not be replaced when they die, and other animals could be sent to other zoos or wildlife sanctuaries. The state of New York funds just 2.7 percent of the Bronx Zoo and the New York Aquarium's budget, but zoo officials say it will be difficult to make up. Between the state budget cuts, the loss in the value of their endowment and fewer people renewing memberships -- times are so tough for the zoo and aquarium -- they say they may lay off 120 to 130 people. ""Two-thirds of our budget is people, and so two-thirds of the cuts will come in cutting positions,"" Sanderson said. ""And we'll also cut back what we provide in the way of education and entertainment and nature experiences for people. So it affects everything."" Zoo officials questioned the state's priorities. But just about everybody getting taxpayer funds has to cut back. Jeffrey Gordon, a spokesman for the New York State Budget Office told CNN the cuts are regrettable but necessary considering the state's current financial crisis. Citing a ""dramatic reduction in revenue,"" Gordon said, ""Every entity that receives state funds must do what the state has done, which is to review its operations and identify ways to operate at lower costs."" The Bronx Zoo isn't the only one affected; cutbacks are happening everywhere. The Los Angeles Zoo in California stopped work on its $42 million elephant exhibit last year, and there are big budget cuts for zoos in Maryland, Missouri and North Carolina. There's no relief for the zoos in the $819 billion economic stimulus package. Section 1109 of the stimulus bill which passed this week in the House forbids the use of federal taxpayer money to plug the budget gaps. Taxpayer watchdog groups lobbied to keep zoos, aquariums, swimming pools, golf courses and casinos out of the stimulus, arguing that there are higher priorities for Americans' money during a recession.","State budget cuts threaten funding for zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The head of a shipping company recently victimized by pirates off the Somali coast told lawmakers Tuesday that U.S. cargo crews should be allowed to arm themselves in response to the rising hijacking threat. In April, pirates attacked The Liberty Sun, a U.S.-flagged  cargo ship, but were unable to board. Philip Shapiro, head of Liberty Maritime Corp., told a U.S. Senate Commerce subcommittee that the owners of U.S.-flagged ""have done all they can within the law to protect our crews."" Unfortunately, he said, U.S. vessels are still largely at the mercy of pirates in shipping lanes around the heavily trafficked Gulf of Aden. ""In light of the recent threats to U.S. merchant mariners, we respectfully request that Congress consider clearing the obstacles that currently block ship owners from arming our vessels,"" Shapiro said. Pirates unsuccessfully attempted to board the Liberty Sun, a cargo vessel owned by Shapiro's company, near the Somali coast on April 14. The ship was on a humanitarian relief mission at the time, carrying 47,000 tons of food to Mombassa, Kenya. Pirate leaders later said the attempted hijacking was carried out as revenge after the U.S. Navy killed three pirates involved in a failed attack on the cargo ship Maersk Alabama. The slain pirates were holding Capt. Richard Phillips, who was in charge of the Alabama when it was boarded April 8. ""We've heard some suggestions that U.S.-flagged ship owners have not done enough to protect their vessels,"" Shapiro said. ""That view ... is flat wrong. Our company adopted every measure recommended by the international maritime organizations and required by the Coast Guard's approved security plan for making the vessel a difficult piracy target -- and more."" Merchant vessels don't usually carry firearms, he said, but the ""Maersk Alabama incident constitutes a game changer. ... Self-proclaimed pirate leaders have now issued direct threats of violence against American merchant mariners."" Shapiro said that U.S. crews have a right to self-defense under U.S. laws dating back to 1819, but ""recently enacted State Department arms export regulations effectively prohibit the arming of vessels."" He also said that ship owners are at risk of ""being second-guessed in U.S. and foreign courts for self-defensive measures that were common in 1819."" Shapiro urged congressional leaders to help ""bring U.S. law up to date and give us the legal framework we need to be able to protect ourselves."" Until then, he said, U.S. naval escorts or government security teams will be required for U.S. vessels on high-risk transits. Shapiro was joined at the committee hearing by Phillips, who said the most desirable response would be the establishment of U.S. military escorts as well as military detachments. Phillips repeated an assertion he made before a separate Senate committee last week that arming vessels' crews could provide an effective deterrent -- but only under certain limited circumstances. ""Unless the root causes of piracy are addressed [on land], piracy will continue to expand and evolve into an even greater threat for American and foreign seamen,"" Phillips said. A Transportation Department official testifying at the hearing noted that the ships most vulnerable to attack are those built low to the water with insufficient top speeds. Ships need to be able to accelerate to ""a high rate of speed [for] aggressive maneuvering"" and should have high walls that are tough for pirates to scale, said Undersecretary of Transportation Roy Kienitz. He recommended that ship owners mandate a range of ""best practices,"" including having fire hoses to spray water over the side of a ship and extra manning for watches during dawn and dusk, when attacks are tougher to detect. Shapiro said that the crew of the Liberty Sun was able to fend off the pirate attack in part by rigging fire hoses to cover the stern of the vessel and ""create a virtual flood wall of water coming off the ship."" Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, applauded the efforts of the crews on both the Alabama and the Liberty Sun. ""These bandits have to be stopped,"" he said at the opening of the hearing. ""Violence and lawlessness will not be tolerated whether on land, in the sky or at sea. We have a duty to protect the ships that proudly fly America's flag.""","Liberty Maritime Corp. chief speaks before U.S. Senate Commerce subcommittee .

"(CNN) -- Miriam Brown has always wanted to visit Cape Cod, but when she recently began to plan a trip and found out she would have to pay $200 or more a night for lodging, her dream vacation seemed out of reach. Miriam Brown and her husband bartered their services for room and board on Cape Cod. Brown, who lives in New Orleans, Louisiana, is an accountant. Her husband is a home renovations contractor. Like many people dealing with a soft real estate market and high food and gas prices, they just don't have that kind of extra cash for a trip. ""I have traveled a lot in prior years, but after [Hurricane] Katrina, there's just no money for traveling,"" Brown said. So she still plans to go, but she won't spend any cash at all on lodging. Brown has joined the growing ranks of Americans who are bartering -- trading goods and services without exchanging money -- as a way to cope with tough economic times. Brown posted an ad in the barter section of the online community Craigslist last month, offering to trade her accounting skills and her husband's knack for home repairs in exchange for room and board on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. She has lots of company. There were some 142,000 listings in the barter section of Craigslist in July, or almost double the number posted during the same month last year, according to Craigslist spokeswoman Susan MacTavish Best. ""When the economy turns unfriendly, Craigslist users become far more creative to get their everyday tasks done,"" Best said. Swapping 'to get by' Other Web sites that put Americans in touch with like-minded people who are willing to trade everything under the sun have also seen a boost in traffic. SwapThing, which lists almost 3.5 million ""things"" available for trade, reports its customers are bartering for different reasons than before. ""I think a few years ago it was more for fun,"" said Jessica Hardwick, SwapThing founder and CEO. ""But we've seen a real shift in the last year, and especially an increase in the last few months, where I think people are really doing it to get by."" Some of the most popular items to trade for late this summer were school uniforms, which some parents found they could not afford to buy for their children, Hardwick said. Experts aren't surprised Americans are becoming more financially creative during an economic downturn. ""Historically, when times get tough, you see a 50 percent-plus increase in bartering as a way for people to be able to buy things or get things and do it economically,"" said C. Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group. The company talks with thousands of consumers every week to gauge their spending habits and attitudes. A couple of years ago, many Americans had $500 to spend at the end of the month, but that money has evaporated because of rising prices, Beemer said. ""We've never had a time, at least in my lifetime, where you have food and fuel going up at the same time. So it isn't a question of buying things, it's a question of buying nothing,"" Beemer said. Breast implants and a horse . Businesses have long recognized the benefits of bartering, and there are hundreds of barter networks set up across the country to fill their needs. They use barter credits as currency, so a plumber in need of a filling doesn't need to search for a dentist's office with plumbing problems to make a deal. He can fix a leaky pipe for one member of a network and use the credits he earned for that job at any other. Since all kinds of companies are members, the trades can be all over the map, said Michael Krane, president of Green Apple Barter Services in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His company has brokered everything from breast implants to college tuition to a horse. ""Really, there are no limits to it. We trade for just about anything you can think of,"" Krane said. Bartering on this scale is also robust in tough economic times. Krane said his exchange has seen a 20 percent rise in barter transaction volume in the first six months of this year. A longtime client is Thomas Forrest, an orthodontist in suburban Pittsburgh who barters his services for everything from office improvements to stationery. His practice hasn't been affected by the economic downturn, Forrest said, but some of his patients seem glad to be able to visit him under the barter arrangement. ""I think if you have a business owner who has children in need of braces, I sense a gratitude that that's available,"" Forrest said. Barter exchanges must carefully document all trades, since the Internal Revenue Service considers income from bartering as taxable. However, a barter exchange ""does not include arrangements that provide solely for the informal exchange of similar services on a noncommercial basis,"" according to the IRS. In New Orleans, Brown and her husband are getting ready to go to Cape Cod after finding a taker for her bartering offer on Craigslist. The couple will work five hours a day in exchange for staying in ""a beautiful three-bedroom house right in the center of it all,"" Brown said. ""We can do a lot more if we don't have to pay for room and board,"" she added.","Many Americans are bartering as a way to cope with tough economic times .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The Florida Department of Law Enforcement closed a sex-related criminal probe of former U.S. Rep. Mark Foley on Friday without filing charges, authorities said. ""There is insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges,"" said Gerald Bailey, commissioner of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Authorities were investigating whether the Florida Republican, who resigned in September 2006, might have used congressional computers to engage or solicit minors in any illegal activities. Officials said they were hindered by refusal from Foley and the House of Representatives to allow inspection of the computers. ""FDLE conducted as thorough and comprehensive investigation as possible considering Congress and Mr. Foley denied us access to critical data,"" Bailey said in a written statement. ""Should additional information arise which is pertinent to this case, we will ensure it is appropriately investigated."" Foley is ""relieved"" that no probable cause was found to charge him with a crime, his lawyer, David Roth, told reporters Friday evening. But in a statement Roth read on behalf of the former congressman, Foley added, ""I however recognize that while my behavior was not illegal, it does not by any means make it proper or approriate. To the contrary, I am deeply ashamed of my conduct, which was wrong and without question inappropriate."" Foley said he takes full responsibility for his actions and apologized, particularly to the recipients of the e-mails or instant messages. ""I continue to pray for forgiveness from those I have disappointed"" and emotionally harmed, Foley said in the statement. Foley entered treatment for alcoholism on October 1, 2006, he said in his statement, and has been clean and sober since the day he resigned from Congress. Roth has denied that his client engaged in sexual activity with minors. ""He is absolutely, positively not a pedophile,"" attorney David Roth said previously. ""He is apologetic for the communications he made while under the influence of alcohol, which he acknowledges are totally inappropriate."" Those communications included scores of e-mails and instant messages that were given to investigators by former House pages. The exchanges -- in which Foley used the screen name MAF 54 -- were published in a House ethics committee report in December 2006. Roth told reporters Friday that Foley has no intention of re-entering politics and is focusing on his recovery. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement put the price tag for the nearly two-year investigation at about $37,800. Foley entered a treatment facility for alcoholism shortly after resigning, saying he is gay and was molested by a priest when he was between the ages of 13 and 15. A Catholic priest living in Italy admitted in a TV interview that he molested Foley when he was a teenager. ""Once maybe, I touched him or so, but I didn't -- it wasn't -- because it's not something you call, I mean rape or penetration or anything like that, you know. We were just fondling,"" said the priest, Anthony Mercieca. The ethics committee's probe concluded that House GOP leaders were negligent in not protecting male teenage pages from possible improper advances by Foley. But the panel said there were no violations of the House Code of Official Conduct and decided no one would be reprimanded. A Justice Department report issued a month later said the FBI should have notified the House or other officials when members first learned of the inappropriate e-mails. The FBI acted within its ""range of discretion"" when it initially decided not to open a criminal investigation in the case, the Justice Department said. But the internal watchdog's investigation concluded that simply filing away the complaint from a public interest group was an inadequate response. The FDLE's investigative summary notes that the U.S. House's clerk of courts took possession of two computer hard drives from Foley's two district offices in Florida and the computer from his Washington office, along with backup material. The department said it did not seek a search warrant for the drives because it failed to turn up probable cause of a crime with a Florida connection. The department report said that Foley's attorneys voluntarily worked with the Justice Department to review computer data, but the FDLE failed to work out a similar review with Foley's attorneys. The department said it was given no indication from the FBI or the Justice Department that there was any non-congressional data in the material that would violate Florida law. CNN's Kevin Bohn and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","Former lawmaker accused of sending suggestive messages to House pages .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The number of movies nominated for the best picture Oscar will double next year, a move apparently aimed at bolstering sagging ratings for the Academy Awards broadcast. Danny Boyle exults in an Oscar win for ""Slumdog Millionaire"" earlier this year. ""Having 10 Best Picture nominees is going allow academy voters to recognize and include some of the fantastic movies that often show up in the other Oscar categories, but have been squeezed out of the race for the top prize,"" Sid Ganis, president of the Academy Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, said. Doubling the nominations would make it more likely a viewer's favorite movie is in the running for the top honor, which may make them want to watch the show, said Steve Pond, author of ""The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards."" ""This clearly is a reaction to declining ratings,"" Pond said. ""Even though this last show the ratings were up ... over the last 10 years or so the ratings have been down."" Oscar producers realized they ""can juice the show up all you want, but people watch the Oscars when there are movies competing that they have an interest in,"" Pond said. The best picture nominations often consist of movies that ""the vast majority of people have not seen,"" he said. The problem ""came to a head with 'The Dark Knight,' "" which sold more than $1 billion in tickets worldwide, but was snubbed by the academy in the best picture category last year, he said. The Batman sequel won best movie at the MTV Movie Awards and was chosen favorite movie by the People's Choice Awards. It also made many critics' top 10 lists. If the nomination field had been expanded last year, the film might have made the best picture list, ""which clearly would have been some kind of bump in the ratings,"" Pond said. This would also counter the impression among TV viewers that the awards show is ""for movie snobs who don't like the movies I like,"" he said. The decision to double the number of features films nominated is a return to the way the Oscars were awarded in its early decades, when as many as 12 movies were considered in the field of finalists, Ganis said. ""After more than six decades, the Academy is returning to some of its earlier roots, when a wider field competed for the top award of the year,"" Ganis said. ""The final outcome, of course, will be the same -- one best picture winner -- but the race to the finish line will feature 10, not just five, great movies from 2009."" Nominations for the 82nd Academy Awards will be announced on February 2, 2010. The awards show is set for March 7 at Hollywood's Kodak Theatre. A best picture nomination often serves as a marketing boost for films, driving DVD sales for those films no longer in theaters.","NEW: Nominating more films ""a reaction to declining ratings,"" says expert .

"(CNN)  -- The Polish president on Saturday signed his country's ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, aimed at streamlining the workings of the European Union. Polish President Lech Kaczynski holds the EU's Lisbon Treaty in Warsaw on October 10. President Lech Kaczynski's approval of the treaty leaves the Czech Republic as the lone country that has not ratified the document. Kaczynski signed the treaty at a ceremony attended by EU officials in Warsaw. He had refused to sign the document until it was ratified by Irish voters in a referendum. They backed it by a wide margin on October 2. ""I am certain that the union will function even better with the treaty of Lisbon,"" Kaczynski said Saturday, in an excerpt of his remarks provided by the Swedish presidency of the EU. The treaty would create an EU president and foreign minister and introduce rotating representatives for member countries in the EU Commission, the union's executive branch. All member states have to ratify the treaty before it can be adopted. ""The Czech Republic must conclude their ratification process by the signature of President Klaus. Europe is waiting impatiently,"" Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said, according to the Swedish presidency. The Lisbon treaty is undergoing review in a Czech court, which will determine in a few weeks whether it is compatible with the nation's constitution. Czech President Vaclav Klaus must also sign it. On Friday, Klaus outlined his objections to the treaty, saying at a news conference that ""the Lisbon Treaty constitutes a fundamental change for the Czech Republic. ""As you know, I have always considered this treaty a step in the wrong direction,"" he said. ""It will increase its democratic deficit, worsen the standing of our country and expose it to new risks -- among other things also because it endangers the legal status of the citizens and the stability of property rights in our country,"" he said. He said he was particularly concerned about one section of the treaty, called the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which concerns fundamental human rights, including property rights, for EU citizens. ""On its basis, the Luxembourg Court of Justice of the EU will assess whether the legal provisions, customs and practices of the EU member countries comply with those of the charter,"" Klaus said. ""The charter makes it possible to reexamine even those decisions of the Czech courts that are legally binding,"" he said. He said he feared the treaty would make it possible to raise property claims related to the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia following World War II. The last Czech government did not pay enough attention to this possibility, he said, and did not negotiate an exemption from the charter, which Poland and the United Kingdom have, he said. ""Before the ratification, Czech Republic must at least ex post negotiate a similar exemption,"" he said. ""I think this exemption can be solved quickly."" Klaus spoke with Reinfeldt by phone on Thursday about the treaty. ""This sends the wrong message at the wrong time,"" Reinfeldt said afterward, his spokeswoman, Roberta Alenius told CNN. Czech Prime Minister Jan Fischer said in a Friday statement that he had seen Klaus' concerns, and said that he regretted that the president did not consult with the government beforehand. ""I remain convinced that the Czech Republic will bring the ratification process of the Lisbon Treaty to a successful conclusion, so that it can enter into force by the end of the year,"" he said.","Treaty undergoing review in a Czech court to determine its compatiblity .

"IN THE FLORIDA KEYS (CNN) -- In the early morning darkness of the Florida Keys, the low hum of the Mystic I is hardly enough to disturb the slumber of the tourists in their hotel rooms. A lobster fisherman holds two spiny tail lobsters caught during the Mystic I's trip off the Florida Keys. From the wheelhouse, Captain Karl Lessard steers his boat into the darkness toward the fertile fishing grounds off the small Island of Marathon, Florida. This is a ritual that Lessard has done thousands of times. ""I've been fishing for 38 years, my family has been fishing since the 1820s, there are a lot of fourth-, fifth- and sixth-generation fishermen that are here in the Keys,"" Lessard says. At dawn he reaches a spot that holds a special meaning for him. ""I pass where my mother's and father's ashes are scattered. Just around sunrise, it's a very spiritual place for me."" In the light of a spectacular sunrise, Lessard plots his course on the open waters. ""I fish for the freedom,"" he explains. ""It's good for the soul. It's a fantastic way to make a living, coming out here in God's glory every day."" He adds with a laugh that fishing also ""gets me away from the house. I hate those 'honey-do's.' "" It's spiny tail lobster season in the Florida Keys, and that is what Captain Karl and his three-man crew are on a quest for today. ""I am hoping to catch between 300 and 400 pounds, with the new moon that slows fishing down,"" the skipper says. They travel 20 miles offshore to where they have put out their traps. They hope to find them filled with the clawless crustaceans that live in these shallow waters. ""In the Keys, people really started fishing for lobster in the 1930s,"" Lessard says. ""Before that there was very little market for them."" Lobster fishermen in years past worried more about the impact of things like hurricanes, but these days they have other concerns, namely the price they can get for their catch. ""This ... economy that we are in is not really promoting the sale of our product,"" Lessard says. ""Lobster is going from eight dollars a pound to three dollars a pound. We are basically in survival mode at the present time, but it is still a wonderful way to make a living."" As a mate hooks the buoys and throws the line in the winches, the traps break onto the surface. As they are hoisted on deck the captain smiles at what he is seeing. ""We got some nice lobsters today, some grandes,"" he says.  Watch the skipper at work on the water Â» . Lessard navigates his boat along his strings of traps as his crew pulls them, repeating the motion some 480 times. Two dolphins play off the bow. ""This is the most beautiful office that anyone could have in the world,"" the lobster fisherman says. ""If you feel the calling, there is no better way to make a living. It's something I've wanted to do since I was a child, and I'm blessed to have been able to do what I wanted to do in life, and have the freedom to do it. ""I hope my family can do it for another hundred years."" As the afternoon wears on, the traps rise out of the ocean and fall back to the seabed, and a constant flow of lobster fills up the boat's holding tanks. The catch seems to be better than expected. ""Sometimes if you are lucky, it's better than being good. And if you're good and lucky, that's even better,"" Lessard jokes. With the last trap dropped back into the water, Lessard and the crew of the Mystic I head back to the dock, where they will place the day's catch onto the scales to see how good the sea has been to them. ""Today we caught 476 pounds. I didn't expect to do this well with the phase of the moon,"" Lessard says. Tomorrow morning the captain will rise again in the darkness and answer the calling that he and his family have heeded for generations. ""My family is out here, and I plan on being out here and joining them someday,"" Lessard says, ""although I would like it to be a long time from now.""","Lobster fisherman's family has been working the waters since the 1820s .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Jay Leno says immediacy is key to his new show, and he should have plenty of it for his prime time premiere Monday, when Kanye West is a musical guest. Kanye West, center,  with girlfriend Amber Rose and actor Tracy Morgan at the 2009 MTV VMAs. The rapper created a fan and artist uprising Sunday night when he jumped onstage at MTV's Video Music Awards to hijack singer Taylor Swift's acceptance speech. Leno could reprise his 1995 ratings-grabbing moment when he asked actor Hugh Grant, ""What the hell were you thinking?"" Grant had been arrested two weeks earlier for public lewd conduct with a Hollywood hooker. West placed a written apology on his Web site -- ""I'm sooooo sorry"" -- but ""The Jay Leno Show"" could be the place and time for a more personal and public mea culpa.  Watch the details on West's appearance Â» . Leno's publicist confirmed Monday that West was still booked for the NBC show, which tapes just three hours before it airs in the eastern United States at 10 p.m. West was booked by Leno weeks ago to perform with two other hip-hop superstars: Rihanna and Jay-Z. Some drama may center around how West and Jay-Z get along onstage. Jay-Z's wife, singer Beyonce Knowles, was perhaps the most embarrassed by his outburst. Swift, a 19-year-old country-pop singer, was in the midst of her acceptance speech for the Best Female Video award when West rushed onstage and took her microphone. He then let loose an outburst on behalf of Beyonce, who was one of several artists who lost out to Swift. Although Beyonce appeared stunned as she watched from the front row, she gracefully recovered near the end of the show, when she was onstage to accept an award of her own. ""I remember being 17 years old, up for my first MTV award with Destiny's Child, and it was one of the most exciting moments of my life,"" she said, referring to the girl group with which she had her start. ""So I would like for Taylor to come out and have her moment."" West's online apology appeared soon after. ""I'm sooooo sorry to Taylor Swift and her fans and her mom,"" the message said in all caps. ""I spoke to her mother right after and she said the same thing my mother would've said. She is very talented! ... I'm in the wrong for going on stage and taking away from her moment!"" MTV said the West-Swift incident was not planned, a point it had to stress after a walkout by singer Eminem at last year's event turned out to be staged. Staged or not, apologies from celebrities behaving badly have been good for Leno's ratings. When Grant told Leno ""I did a bad thing,"" it gave Leno's ""Tonight Show"" a viewership bump that has been credited with solidifying his lead over rival David Letterman in the late-night ratings war. This is just the kind of ""immediacy"" Leno was talking about in a call with reporters last week. ""The idea here is that we'll tape a new, fresh show every single day, talking about the events that happened that day that night,"" Leno said. West, Rihanna and Jay-Z will debut Leno's new approach to musical guests. They will be limited to one song, and most nights they'll share the stage with other stars. ""What we're trying to do is put together acts that you don't normally see together or don't normally perform together,"" Leno said. Jerry Seinfeld will also appear on Leno's premiere Monday.","Rapper Kanye West scheduled to appear on ""The Jay Leno Show""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Top Obama administration officials outlined several new initiatives to safeguard the country's food supply Tuesday, saying the recent spate of food-borne illnesses is unacceptable. Recent salmonella outbreaks, including one at Nestle, were called unacceptable by federal officials Tuesday. The FDA intends to issue new guidance over the next three months regarding steps the entire food industry can take to more quickly detect contamination sources and remove the unsafe products from stores. A new position at the agency -- deputy commissioner for foods -- will be created for the sole purpose of overseeing food protection. The commissioner will be part of a ""unified incident command system"" established to address contamination outbreaks and facilitate responses at the federal, state, and local levels, officials said. In addition, they said, food safety information will be more effectively communicated to the public through a revamped Web site: www.foodsafety.gov. The announcement was made near the White House by Vice President Joe Biden, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""There are few responsibilities more basic or more important ... for the government than making sure our families in America eat food that is not contaminated,"" Biden said. Dozens of people have become sick in recent weeks due to a nationwide E. coli outbreak linked to tainted Nestle cookie dough. Spinach, peanut products, pistachios, peppers, mushrooms, alfalfa sprouts, have also been recent culprits, noted Sebelius. An estimated 5,000 Americans die annually after consuming contaminated food and tens of millions fall ill, she said. J.D. Hanson, a policy analyst for the Center for Food Safety, called the initiatives a good first step. ""They are the kinds of things we have been calling on previous administrations to do, and we're glad this administration is moving fairly quickly on these issues,"" he told CNN. Hanson praised the creation of the position of deputy commissioner for foods at the FDA, saying it should have happened long ago. ""You'd think an agency called 'Food and Drug' would have made food a priority a long time ago. They didn't until today."" But he said the government still isn't tough enough with the food industry. ""Their goal of 90 percent compliance with their new guidelines is not good enough. It needs to be very close to 100 percent compliance."" And he said bureaucracy stands in the way of improvement. ""Right now there are 13 federal agencies that deal with food safety. We would pull all of those functions into one agency."" Making eggs safer . New safeguards to protect against salmonella contamination of eggs alone should cut the number of food-borne illnesses every year by roughly 80,000, and generate an annual savings of over $1 billion, according to Sebelius. ""Salmonella enteritidis is a major cause of food-borne illness in the United States and eggs are a significant source,"" Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, told reporters in a telephone conference call. The $81 million program will translate into less than a penny per dozen eggs and will yield $1.4 billion in annual public health benefits, the agency said. In all, more than 79,000 of the 142,000 cases of sickness and 30 deaths associated with tainted eggs each year will be prevented, it predicted. Under the rule, egg producers must buy their chickens and hens from producers who monitor for salmonella bacteria, said Dr. Stephen F. Sundlof, director of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. If salmonella bacteria or its derivatives are detected, a sample of eggs from the facility must be tested over eight weeks, he said. If any test positive, the producer must process the eggs to destroy the bacteria or divert the eggs to non-food uses. In addition, henhouses must be tested and those that test positive must be cleaned and disinfected, he said. Under current law, eggs do not have to be refrigerated until they are packed for the ultimate consumer, said Nancy Bufano, a food technologist at the agency. ""What's new here is requiring now that eggs must be refrigerated on the farm and during transport and storage beginning no later than 36 hours after the time they're laid,"" she said. A key part of the plan to reduce salmonella enteritidis is the requirement that producers institute rodent-control programs, said Darrell Trampel, a poultry veterinarian at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. ""Mice are notorious carriers of [salmonella enteritidis] and, in the fall when it starts getting cold, the mice start looking for a warmer home and some of them make their way into chicken houses, and then they leave their droppings behind in the feed and so the chickens pick it up in that manner."" Producers will have to pay more to comply with the testing requirements, ""but I don't think this should put anybody out of business,"" he said. The rules go into effect within a year for producers with more than 50,000 hens, which produce approximately 71 percent of eggs sold to consumers, the FDA's Sundlof said. Those with fewer than 50,000 hens have three years to comply; those with fewer than 3,000 hens or those that sell directly to consumers are exempt. About 1 in 200 eggs in flocks of fewer than 3,000 hens test positive for salmonella and derivatives, Sundlof said. Until now, egg quality assurance programs have been voluntary, Sundlof said. ""So the fact that they will now be required really gives us greater assurance."" Industry supports the requirements, though many of them have long been complying voluntarily, said Howard Magwire, director of government relations for United Egg Producers, a trade association. ""Our egg farmers have always done everything they could to provide a safe, affordable, high-protein product to consumers and for years we have been supportive of the concept of an egg-safety rule to address the salmonella enteritidis problem,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""Do we go out and do a pep rally for more regulation? No, but at the same time, we understand why the industry has been moving that way.""

"(CNN) -- Diprivan is a powerful I.V. anesthetic drug used for patients undergoing certain surgeries and diagnostic procedures. Patients undergoing surgery may receive Diprivan to keep them sedated during the procedure. The drug is making headlines with the claim from a nurse who worked for pop icon Michael Jackson that the singer, who died June 25, had repeatedly asked her about the drug. Nurse Cherilyn Lee told CNN that Jackson had brought up Diprivan about three months ago, saying he needed it for insomnia and that his doctor said it was safe. ""He said, 'I am so sleepy. I cannot sleep. I want to have at least eight hours of sleep,'"" Lee told CNN's Anderson Cooper. The medication, whose generic name is propofol, renders the patient unconscious for as long as doctors deem necessary. The patient wakes up almost immediately after the infusion is stopped, experts say. But treating sleep disorders is not an approved use of the drug. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says Diprivan should be given only by people trained in the administration of general anesthesia and who are not involved in the conduct of the surgery or diagnostic procedure.  Watch Dr. Gupta explain when and how propofol (Diprivan) is used Â» . The general anesthetic has the effect of making patients feel well-rested when they wake up from it, said Dr. Hector Vila, chairman of the Ambulatory Surgery Committee for the American Society of Anesthesiologists. Vila gives the drug to all of his patients who are getting office procedures in areas such as urology, dentistry and gynecology. It is also the most common anesthetic for colonoscopies, he said. ""I have never heard of anyone using it for the treatment of a sleep disorder,"" he said. There have been cases of health care professionals self-administering the drug and abusing it, however, said Vila, who has examined deaths from Diprivan in Florida. Other deaths from the drug have occurred when administered by non-anesthetist professionals, in settings such as ophthalmology, gynecology and plastic surgery, he said. Diprivan appears white and milky, and is usually run as an I.V. drip. In addition to surgical applications, it can be used in the intensive care unit for someone who may be intubated on a ventilator. The drug itself does not provide pain relief, experts say. The principle risks of Diprivan come from improper monitoring of the patient's breathing, Vila said. When a person's breathing slows down, not enough carbon dioxide gets removed from the body, and not enough oxygen enters. This could lead to cardiac arrest, he said. Still, when used properly, Diprivan is not a dangerous drug, he said. ""It's very safe in a properly trained physician's hands."" The drug has been used in the past to treat prolonged epileptic seizures. A small MayoClinic study in 2008 found that Diprivan was associated with a higher risk of cardiac arrest and deaths in patients with a condition called refractory status epilepticus. Side effects of Diprivan may include dizziness and lightheadedness. Balance, coordination and judgment may be affected for up to 24 hours, so patients should not drive cars, play sports or sign contracts in that period, Vila said. Patients may also experience a euphoric feeling upon waking up, Vila said. This is distinct from older anesthetics, which caused nausea and vomiting, he said. The FDA also issued a warning to health care professionals in 2007 about patients who experienced chills, fever and body aches shortly after receiving the drug for sedation or general anesthesia. Doctors consider sedation a continuum, where relaxation is on the mild side and general anesthesia is at the other extreme. There may be complications of Diprivan if the patient is also taking prescription pain medications, experts say. Patients should tell their health care providers about any allergies they have before taking this drug, doctors say, including eggs, soy products, sulfite, benzyl alcohol and any medications. CNN's Stephanie Smith contributed to this report.","Diprivan renders the patient unconscious for as long as doctors deem necessary .

"(CNN)  -- A militant Islamist group associated with al Qaeda has for the first time threatened to attack Israel, far from its normal base of operations in Somalia. Al-Shabab, which is fighting to control the east African country, accused Israel of ""starting to destroy"" the Al Aqsa mosque, where standoffs have taken place recently between Israeli police and Palestinians. The mosque is part of the complex that Jews call the Temple Mount and Muslims call Haram al-Sharif. ""The Jews started to destroy parts of the holy mosque of Al Aqsa and they routinely kill our Palestinian brothers, so we are committed to defend our Palestinian brothers,"" said Mukhtar Robow Abu Mansur, a prominent Al-Shabab commander. His threat was part of a series of fiery sermons delivered after Friday prayers in Baidoa in southwest Somalia. Al-Shabab controls the region, which is part of a country that has been without an effective national government for nearly 20 years. Other leaders of the group also threatened Israel, the first time the group is known to have done so. ""We will transfer and expand our fighting in the Middle East so we can defend Al Aqsa mosque from the Israelis,"" Al-Shabab commander Abdifatah Aweys Abu Hamza said in Mogadishu, the Somali capital. He is apparently the leader of a new Al-Shabab armed group calling themselves ""Mujahedin Al Aqsa,"" or ""Al Aqsa Holy Warriors,"" which they said is assigned to attack Israel. It is not clear whether Al-Shabab has the capacity to carry out its threats against Israel. But Rashid Abdi of the International Crisis Group, speaking last week before al-Shabab issued its threats against Israel, warned that the group should be taken seriously. ""We should not underestimate the capacity of Al-Shabab,"" he said. ""This is a deadly organization, a formidable foe."" Abdi said the group had been mutating from a nationalist group into a terrorist organization more like al Qaeda, which was behind the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. ""If you look at the rhetoric and language and if you look at the Web sites, if you hear their preachers or their scholars speak, it is completely indistinguishable from al Qaeda leaders,"" Abdi said. The group has also become more vicious in Somalia, a local human rights expert said. ""The most gruesome and gross violations of human rights are committed by Al-Shabab,"" activist Hassan Shire Sheikh said. ""They have also instilled fear. They just shoot, they kill, they maim and they lash."" The group also threatened African neighbors on Friday, including Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, Eritrea, Ghana, Sudan and Uganda. They have in the past threatened African nations that provide peacekeeping troops to the war-torn country. The U.S. State Department Country Reports on Terrorism from April lists Al-Shabab as a terrorist organization and blames it for shootings and suicide bombings inside Somalia. It does not list the group as having carried out violence outside Somalia, but says some members of the group have trained and fought alongside al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991, when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and sparked brutal clan infighting. The transitional government has struggled to establish authority, challenged by Islamist groups like Al-Shabab that have seized control of Mogadishu and much of the south. CNN's David McKenzie in Nairobi, Kenya, contributed to this report.","Al-Shabab accuses Israel of ""starting to destroy"" the Al Aqsa mosque .

"(CNN) -- Jurors spared the life of a former Canton, Ohio, police officer who killed his pregnant girlfriend and tearfully asked them for mercy. A judge then sentenced him Wednesday to 57 years to life in prison. Bobby Lee Cutts Jr. stared straight ahead as the jury announced its recommendation to spare him. Bobby Lee Cutts Jr., 30, will be 87 by the time he becomes eligible for parole. He stared straight ahead as the jury of six men and six women recommended that his life be spared. He and his lawyer teared up as the jurors were polled about their decision.  Watch Cutts react Â» . Judge Charles E. Brown added to the sentence, taking other counts into consideration after hearing victim impact statements from the parents and sisters of victim Jessie Marie Davis. She was 26 and nine months pregnant when she disappeared last June. Her body, and that of her unborn child, were found 10 days later at a state park in northeastern Ohio. Whitney Davis, Jessie's sister, directed her anger and grief at Cutts. ""You got rid of someone that was an inconvenience. I hate you.""  Watch Davis' family lash out at Cutts Â» . She continued: """"You used and manipulated her over and over and still you sit there and you are not crying. I don't believe that you are sorry for what you did. I believe that you are sorry that you got caught up in all your lies. I don't know that you would know the truth.""Watch sister tell Cutts she hates him . Cutts took off his eyeglasses as Davis' father, Ned, addressed him: ""Don't even look at me."" ""Your honor he violently murdered her,"" the anguished father continued. ""Five-foot-four, nine months pregnant, that baby could have been delivered."" And, tears rolled down Cutts' face as Davis' mother, Patricia Porter, spoke of her grief. ""There are mornings I have to cover her picture up, when I can't get out of bed."" She continued, ""I serve an amazing God, Bobby. A God that forgives and heals and restores people. And all I know today is that I do forgive you, and I know it is only through him that I am able to do that."" But she turned the other cheek: ""I may not have family to go home to after this, but I pray that you make a way for him to get out of there and begin a new life, and to be able to hold his son."" Porter, who is raising Blake, told Cutts the child ""knows what you did. You would not believe the stories he has told us."" When his time came, Cutts offered no statement, no testimonials to his character. On February 15, the same jury found Cutts guilty of murdering Jessie Davis and their baby, who was to be named Chloe. It was Chloe's death that made Cutts eligible for the death penalty. Jurors convicted him of two counts of aggravated murder -- for terminating a pregnancy and taking her life during the commission of a felony. All the members of the jury are white, as was Davis. Cutts is black. Cutts, who has maintained Davis' death was the result of an accidental elbow to the neck, asked the jury to spare his life and offered a tearful apology at his sentencing hearing Tuesday.  Watch Cutts' tearful plea Â» . ""Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm asking you to spare my life,"" he said. ""To imagine that I was responsible for the death of Jessie, the mother of my children and my unborn daughter, is beyond any words that I can express,"" Cutts added, reading from a handwritten statement. ""Words cannot bring them back, nor can they erase the pain I've caused, but I want to apologize,"" he said. Cutts' lawyer, Fernando Mack, had urged jurors to recommend  the lowest available penalty -- 25 years to life -- to allow him to play a limited role in his other children's lives. Mack acknowledged that many of the jurors might still be angry with Cutts for leaving his 2Â½-year-old son, home alone for more than a day while his mother lay dead in a field. But sentencing Cutts to death hurts Blake even more, he argued. ""That is still Blake's father, like it or not. The prosecutor here wants you to kill Blake's father, so now he'll have no parents."" Stark County Assistant Prosecutor Dennis Barr attacked Cutts' character and his sincerity on the stand. A police officer should have known better, he said. ""Bobby Cutts took an oath to serve and protect,"" the prosecutor argued. ""But on June 14, 2007, Bobby Cutts did not serve and protect. He destroyed."" According to testimony, Cutts rolled Davis' body in a comforter and dumped it in a park, leaving toddler son Blake in the house alone at the crime scene in a soiled diaper. ""Mommy's in the rug,"" Blake told police, according to testimony. Prosecutors charged during the trial that Cutts buckled under the financial pressure of additional child support, killed Davis, and then created a cover story to try to get away with it. After the sentencing, prosecutors -- no longer restricted in their comments by a gag order -- told reporters Cutts led authorities to Davis' body, but no deal was made in return. Davis' father, Ned Davis, told reporters,  ""Our family, in one sense, was fortunate that we had some legal resolution because I know along with this, there are families out there that don't ever get an answer. It doesn't make it any less painful, but at least this part of it is resolved.""  E-mail to a friend .","NEW: Judge gives Bobby Cutts Jr. the maximum life sentence .

"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Some Florida amusement park visitors may enjoy space-themed roller-coasters, but the first vehicle they board at Orlando International Airport may be the most futuristic ride of their vacation. Four hydrogen shuttle buses are part of the fleet at the Orlando International Airport. The airport is testing four Ford shuttle vans equipped with internal combustion engines modified to run on hydrogen instead of gasoline. ""It's quiet, it doesn't shake like diesel, it doesn't have that diesel smell,"" said Rafael Sanchez, who has been driving the vans for a year. The quieter engine makes conversation inside the bus easier than in conventional vehicles. ""Hydrogen is one of the many technologies we are exploring, trying to become more of a green airport,"" said Ronald Lewis, director of airport operations. Vehicles powered with hydrogen engines are different from the many vehicles across the nation that run with the help of hydrogen fuel cells -- which are the gold standard of green machines. The use of hydrogen in internal combustion engines is far less efficient than in the fuel cells. The modified engines aboard the Ford E-450 shuttle buses are 6.8 liter V-10s. The airport's fleet also includes three gas-electric hybrid vehicles and 24 biodiesel buses. The facility also powers its maintenance equipment -- such as lawnmowers and tractors -- with biodiesel. But like many experiments with alternative fuels, the price is very high and the long-term outcome is unknown. Proponents of hydrogen technology have long had a chicken-and-egg dilemma over whether to build million-dollar fueling facilities or to wait until more vehicles are in use. Energy companies are reluctant to pour money into expensive fueling stations without a lot of hydrogen vehicles around, but consumers are not likely to buy a vehicle without adequate places to fill up. ""It is clear nothing is going to displace gasoline or diesel for 20, 30, maybe 40 years,"" said John Lapetz, who has been working on alternative fuels at Ford for more than 20 years. The Orlando project has several goals: To get average consumers acquainted with hydrogen and to acquire data on the buses' performance in a setting where they are in use almost nonstop. Lapetz said it's an effort to use a technology that customers take for granted (the internal combustion engine), while preparing for the day when drivers can complete the divorce from fossil fuels. At the Boggy Creek Hydrogen Fueling Station in Orlando, the hydrogen is produced on-site. ""We are doing a process called steam methane re-forming, which is natural gas to hydrogen,"" said Puneet Verma, manager of biofuels and hydrogen at Chevron Technology Ventures, one of the players involved in the project. During a careful fueling process, technicians check for leaks of the highly flammable hydrogen -- leaks both in the bus and the fuel pump. Because a fossil fuel, methane, is used to make the hydrogen, the buses are about 12 percent cleaner than gasoline or diesel when their entire carbon footprint is measured. ""We view the hydrogen efforts as a technical success,"" said Verma. ""This is the first time we have been able to demonstrate actual production of hydrogen at the station. It's not necessarily an economic success yet."" ""The ultimate goal is hydrogen fuel cell cars,"" Verma said. ""The hydrogen internal combustion engine buses are much less expensive to manufacture, but they consume a lot more hydrogen."" Verma said the buses are ""valid transition technology"" aimed at quickly building significant demand for hydrogen, which would then justify an expensive infrastructure. The hydrogen test project also includes the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority, Ford Motor Company, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Progress Energy and SeaWorld. Hydrogen buses began shuttling SeaWorld employees in February from the park's outer parking lots to their workplaces. ""The environment is really an important part of SeaWorld's culture here,"" said Kelly Bernish, director of environmental health and safety at Busch theme parks SeaWorld, Discovery Cove and Aquatica. Bernish described the venture as another opportunity for ""employees to feel like they can impact the environment by using this kind of vehicle, that will lessen our footprint on the world."" SeaWorld's Discovery Cove animal training supervisor Jay Tacey said ""somebody has to get the ball rolling. Until somebody takes that first step, there's always going to be the 'what if?' "" Airport Operations Director Lewis said being in on the hydrogen experiment early could pay off in the long run. ""We are hopeful that since they built the facility here, the only one in the southeast United States, that there will be a long-term usage for it.""","Orlando airport tests cleaner hydrogen-powered internal combustion engines .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. military said it is investigating claims from Syria that U.S. helicopters based in Iraq killed eight people and wounded another Sunday in an attack inside Syria's territory Sunday. A U.S. army Apache helicopter flies over southern Baghdad, Iraq. Syria's state news agency SANA said four U.S. helicopters crossed the border and struck a farm about 8 kilometers (5 miles) inside Syria before returning to Iraqi airspace. The raid occurred about 4:45 p.m. (1345 GMT). The helicopters hit a civilian building under construction on the farm, killing a father and his four sons, a married couple and another man, SANA said. Syria's deputy foreign minister contacted the U.S. embassies in Damascus and Baghdad, SANA said. Military officials are investigating the claims, Sgt. Brooke Murphy, a U.S. military spokeswoman, told CNN. ""Unfortunately, we cannot confirm anything at the moment,"" she said. The attack occurred near the town of Al-Bukamal, which is home to a Red Crescent camp for Iraqi refugees. The town is across the border from the Iraqi city of Qaim, which has been a major route for Sunni Arab fighters battling U.S. troops in Iraq.  Watch CNN's Cal Perry explain the implications of the possible attack Â» . Syria has said it has made efforts to secure the 600-km desert border, which is marked largely by a sand wall. But Maj. Gen. John Kelly, the U.S. commander in western Iraq's sprawling Anbar province, told reporters last week that much of the border remains ""uncontrolled."" ""We still have a certain level of foreign fighter movement, not much, through Anbar, because of our activities out there,"" Kelly said. But he said Iraqi intelligence believes al Qaeda operatives and others ""live pretty openly on the Syrian side, and periodically we know that they try to come across."" Syria demanded Iraq's government ""immediately investigate this serious violation"" and bar U.S. forces from striking Syria from its territory. The Syrian government summoned U.S. and Iraqi diplomats to the Foreign Ministry in Damascus to condemn the attack, SANA reported. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report, Nada Husseini, Mike Mount and Cal Perry contributed to this report.","State news agency says 3 men, 1 woman, 4 children killed near Iraq-Syria border .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- In a tough job market, MBA graduates seeking top-tier jobs are turning to a career networking site created by and catering to young professionals. Doostang gets its name from the Latin for ""reaching for talent."" Doostang is an online community that seeks to match the brightest new grads with what it says are the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of positions in finance, consulting and tech. Exclusivity is the cornerstone of this network, which connects graduates from elite schools with top employers. The site offers its members access to selective jobs that are not really available on the open market, according to founder Mareza Larizadeh. It's able to do that because recruiting managers are drawn by the caliber of its members, which includes students from the top business schools, he says. Schools like The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and Duke University's Fuqua School of Business have formed partnerships with Doostang that enable their students to access the network's premium job listings for free. ""Our goal is to get great jobs in front of relevant people and relevant candidates in front of hiring managers,"" Larizadeh tells CNN. Larizadeh never intended to launch a career start-up. He was completing his MBA at Stanford University in 2005 when he got the idea for Doostang, which is a modified version of ""reaching for talent"" in Latin. Classmates were exchanging emails about career advice, and ""I thought, why don't we give this some structure?"" he recalls. Four years and a round of venture capital funding later, what started as a hobby designed to help friends share career information has turned into a network with approximately 600,000 members. Larizadeh estimates that roughly a dozen of the top 20 MBA programs have signed partnership deals with Doostang. While mostly U.S. focused, Doostang is also becoming more international and recently sealed a deal to provide job opportunities to INSEAD. In an age where social networking sites abound, Doostang sets itself apart by taking closely knit relationships developed offline in B-school and leveraging them online to make a better job searching experience, Larizadeh says. A member applying for a job at McKinsey, for instance, is able to connect with members of his or her Doostang network that may have a McKinsey link to gain an insider's perspective. Larizadeh believes it isn't just the quality of people and jobs that distinguishes Doostang from other careers sites like LinkedIn and executive search service The Ladders. Doostang is also distinctive in that it caters specifically to students in their 20s and 30s with most of the positions advertised geared towards people at the beginning or middle of their careers. Employers advertising positions on the site range from white shoe firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to Silicon Valley titans Google and Facebook. Users initially had to be invited to join the network, but now Doostang is open to everyone. Members, however, have to pay for access to the most exclusive job postings. This helps keep the membership selective, Larizadeh said. Generally, people won't pay for membership if they aren't qualified for the jobs being advertised, he explained. The fee for premium services, which gives access to the more exclusive job postings, ranges from $25 to $40 a month. The site, which has always featured jobs at hedge funds, private equity firms and investment banks prominently, experienced a surge when the financial crisis kicked off last fall. ""Even though the economy is not as bad as it used to be, we are still seeing a good uptake. Our traffic is still going strong,"" Larizadeh says.","Doostang is a career networking site geared towards 20 and 30-somethings .
Since it was founded in 2005, its membership has grown to 600,000 .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Palestinian militant groups including the armed wing of Hamas are committing war crimes when they fire rockets into Israel, according to a report by campaign group Human Rights Watch. Palestinian militants from the al-Ahrar Brigades march during a rally in Gaza City in July. Three Israelis have been killed and dozens more seriously injured in Palestinian attacks since November 2008 with rockets striking populated areas up to 40 kilometers (25 miles) inside Israeli territory and putting 800,000 Israelis in danger, the report said. Two Palestinian girls died in Gaza when a rocket fell short of its intended target while the attacks have also put Palestinian citizens at risk from Israeli counterstrikes, it added. Human Rights Watch urged Hamas, which controls Gaza, to hold those responsible for the attacks accountable. Hamas is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the European Union. Hamas militants have cut down on rocket strikes in the past few months, but the group has not denounced those targeting Israeli civilians, nor has it tried those behind the attacks, the New York-based watchdog said. ""Hamas rocket attacks targeting Israeli civilians are unlawful and unjustifiable, and amount to war crimes,"" said Iain Levine, program director at Human Rights Watch. ""As the governing authority in Gaza, Hamas should publicly renounce rocket attacks on Israeli civilian centers and punish those responsible, including members of its own armed wing."" A spokesman for Hamas, Sami Abu Zuhri, criticized the report, claiming Palestinians had the right to defend themselves against Israeli military operations. ""The report is not fair,"" he said. ""It should condemn the (Israeli military) crimes instead of condemning people who defend themselves. ""The international law gives them the right to defend themselves because they are occupied. We have the right to defend our land."" During Israel's offensive into Gaza during December and January, Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants claimed to have fired 820 rockets at Israel, the report said. Human Rights Watch said the use of homemade Qassam and Soviet-designed Grad rockets to strike at densely populated areas amounted to indiscriminate attacks on civilians because the weapons cannot be aimed with any reliability. The watchdog found no evidence that Palestinian armed groups had deliberately used civilians as shields in rocket attacks. But it said militants took insufficient precautions to avoid putting civilian lives in danger. ""Hamas forces violated the laws of war both by firing rockets deliberately or indiscriminately at Israeli cities and by launching them from populated areas and endangering Gazan civilians,"" Levine said. Human Rights Watch has also documented war violations by Israeli forces during its three-week offensive into Gaza. While Israeli military operations had been more harmful, killing hundreds of civilians with airstrikes, tank shelling and other assaults, ""violations by one party to a conflict never justify violations by the other,"" it said. ""Attacks targeting civilians are never permitted under the laws of war, which require armed forces to target only military objectives, and to take all feasible precautions to spare civilians from harm, regardless of the reasons for resorting to armed conflict."" The United Nations is investigating violations by both sides and is due to report to the U.N. Human Rights Council in September.","Human Rights Watch: Palestinian rocket attacks against Israel are war crimes .

"(CNN) -- Striker Carlos Vela has signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal, the English Premier League club have announced on their official Web site. The Mexican international signed for Arsenal after coming through the youth ranks at Guadalajara and has subsequently had loan spells at Spanish sides Celta Vigo, Salamanca and Osasuna. The 20-year-old made his Arsenal debut last season, bursting onto the scene with a Carling Cup hat-trick against Sheffield United in September 2008. Manager Arsene Wenger told the Web site: ""We're delighted that Carlos Vela has signed a new long-term contract with the club. Carlos is a fantastic talent and we have already seen glimpses of this during his performances."" The Frenchman continued: ""Let's remember, he is still only 20-years-old, so there is still a huge amount to come from this boy. ""We have invested a lot of time in Carlos, as we put him in Spain for two years to get some good experience. ""Now he's back with us, we're working hard with him every day and he is a very exciting player. ""We're looking forward to seeing Carlos score many goals in an Arsenal shirt for a long time to come."" Vela said: ""I'm very happy to sign a new contract and I'm very excited to be spending more years with Arsenal Football Club. ""I just want to work hard and help this great club win trophies. I want to stay here for a long time and it's a great responsibility. I will keep working hard to show the boss and all the fans why I'm here."" Vela played against Olympiacos in the Champions League on Wednesday but he was one of the biggest culprits as Arsenal squandered a number of chances. He is the 11th first-team player to commit his long-term future to Arsenal since the end of last season. Vela, Eduardo, Sanchez Watt, Alex Song, Nicklas Bendtner, Denilson, Robin van Persie, Theo Walcott, Lukasz Fabianski, Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere have all recently signed new long-term extensions with the club.","Mexican striker Carlos Vela has signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal .

"(InStyle.com) -- Daring in her fashion choices and her roles -- this summer she plays Agent 99 in ""Get Smart"" -- Anne Hathaway is the perfect candidate to answer questions about developing your own unique personal style. Anne Hathaway wears a Valentino satin coat and La Crasia leather gloves at an InStyle photoshoot. Curvaceous and kooky, interesting and interested, Hathaway is a multidimensional gal. In an age of nonstop tabloid exhibitionism, she stands out as a beacon of confident allure. Within a short period of time, the young actress has graduated from fashion ingÃ©nue to a woman who navigates the designer realm with intrepid spirit and lashings of wit. Now that she has her bearings, Hathaway is ready to express her individuality.  Watch how Anne Hathaway changes her style Â» . She arrives for our meeting looking well scrubbed, bohemian and totally incognito: Her navy jacket is from Et Vous in Paris; the jeans, True Religion; the flats, Lanvin; and the bag, Anya Hindmarch. An Yves Saint Laurent lapis lazuli ring and Ugandan handcrafted beads from Beadforlife.org are all the embellishment she needs. It seems to me that nowadays some stars confuse being stylish with dressing really slutty. What's your take?  I've always been on the conservative side when it comes to showing skin. I'm from that school where you show one part of your body, not all of it. So compared to the girls you're talking about, I'm quite prim... [But] sometimes you just make mistakes. I once wore a see-through dress to an event, but I had absolutely no idea ...  You didn't do the lighting test!   And I have never not done the lighting test after that. At the end of the day, you have to dress in what you're comfortable in. If you're at ease in a bikini top and a miniskirt -- though I certainly wouldn't be -- go for it. Can you talk about your style philosophy? If you're going to be glamorous, it has to be tempered with eccentricity so that it incorporates your own personality. Dressing up is great, but you need a twist. And one of my biggest style influences has been Rachel Zoe, who introduced me to glamour. Now I'm kind of pushing her a little bit to explore the eccentric side. Lately, I've been having a lot more fun with how I dress. I am braving the idea of ending up on a worst-dressed list, but I'm also a lot happier with what I wear. What's the most tragic thing you wore in high school? So many things! I was still recovering from Clueless when I was in high school, so probably one too many baby-doll skirts with baby Ts, knee socks, mary janes and barrettes. Maybe the occasional pair of flannel pajama pants during finals week. I don't let myself get that slobby these days. What does the word ""chic"" mean to you? I instantly think of Audrey Hepburn -- she could do no wrong. Her style was revolutionary. She was ladylike without being stuffy. And I also love Tilda Swinton, Cate Blanchett and Selma Blair, who is so fabulous. Any other Hollywood icons lurking in your closet? I'm currently having a Gwen Stefani moment. I just bought some beautiful shorts from her fashion line, LAMB. Do you enjoy the whole red-carpet circus? For a while it was very new and very frightening, and I would just work myself up so in all my photos I looked like I was staring down the barrel of a gun. I don't beat myself up about it anymore. Did you care when the tabloids ragged on your white Valentino dress with the black bow at the 2007 Oscars? I consider it a good sign when you end up on best- and worst-dressed lists. If you're universally best, then you've been quite boring. Let's talk about ""Get Smart"": Is it retro, or did they update the groovy sixties vibe of Agent 99's look? It's groovy in a different way. There are some things that are very mod, but we're not making Austin Powers 4 -- it's not a spoof. It's more like a comedic Bourne Identity.  Watch Hathaway, other stars talk about movie Â» . I wore a few body-hugging dresses, which was so fun since I'm not used to them. I did inherit 99's Chanel bag addiction, and I was very happy about that. I have a ton of action sequences, and I had to be able to fight in every single outfit. Beyond swinging a Chanel handbag, did you do anything in particular to get into shape for this role? I started working out about three months before the film began. I wanted to be curvy and muscle-y. I took my body inspiration from Jessica Biel. I didn't quite get those results, but she's great. David Kirsch, my trainer, has made sure that I am no longer self-conscious about my thighs. Eventually my knees are going to be all wrinkly and I'm not going to be able to wear things like short skirts, so I take pleasure in wearing them now. Next you play a bridezilla opposite Kate Hudson in ""Bride Wars."" Did you get to wear show-stopping bridal gowns? I really can't say too much, but there's a fantastic scene where we're both in our dresses and we do absolutely terrible things to each other. Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE!

"LONDON, England -- Malaria is one of the world's worst health problems and one of its biggest killers, with half a billion people affected every year, according to the Roll Back Malaria partnership. Around half a billion people are infected with malaria every year. Ninety percent of those cases are in Africa. Saturday marks World Malaria Day, when the world commemorates global efforts to eradicate the disease. Below CNN's Vital Signs has produced a complete A - Z guide to how malaria spreads, the symptoms to look out for and how to protect yourself. A is for Anti-malarial drugs The history of anti-malarial medicine has been marked by a constant struggle between evolving drug-resistant parasites and the search for new drugs. Currently, anti-malaria experts are focusing on therapies that combine several drugs for better effects. B is for Blood stream Once a mosquito has bitten and the malaria parasites reach the liver, the parasites divide and create thousands of mature parasites. These are released into the blood and infect red blood cells.  At that point, typical malaria symptoms such as fever and anemia develop. C is for Chloroquine Until recently, Chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, was the first option for many people because of its relatively low price and effectiveness. However, resistance to Chloroquine in many parts of the world has rendered the drug ineffective. D is for Diagnosis After noting your symptoms and travel history, your doctor will likely obtain a sample of your blood for observation. Two blood samples, taken at six- and 12-hour intervals, can usually confirm the presence of the malaria parasite and its type. It is possible to be infected by more than one parasite at the same time. E is for Epidemic According to the World Health Organization (WHO), large and devastating epidemics can occur when the mosquito-borne parasite is introduced into areas where people have had little prior contact with the infecting parasite. These epidemics can be triggered by wet weather conditions and further aggravated by floods or mass population movements driven by conflict. F is for Fever The most common symptom of all types of malarias is high fever, which is why doctors often misdiagnose malaria for flu. The fever is a reaction to toxins in the blood. It is therefore advised to tell your doctor you have been to a malaria affected zone, even if symptoms arise months after the trip. G is for Genome  In 2002, -- hundred years after it was discovered that mosquitoes transmit the malaria parasite -- the complete genetic codes of both the human malaria parasite and the mosquito that spreads it was cracked. This development brought scientists a step closer to developing drugs and vaccines to fight the disease, Nature magazine reported. H is for Hotspots Most cases and deaths are in sub-Saharan Africa, many of them occurring among children. However, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and parts of Europe are also affected. In 2006, malaria was present in 109 countries and territories. I is for Immunity Travelers from malaria-free regions such as Europe and the United States, with little or no immunity, who go to areas with high disease rates, are particularly vulnerable. It is essential to take precautions by taking anti-malarial drugs prescribed by your doctor. J is for Julius Wagner-Jauregg Julius Wagner-Jauregg, a Viennese doctor, was the first to intentionally infect syphilis patients with malaria parasites. By controlling the subsequent malaria-related fever with an anti-malaria drug, the effects of both syphilis and malaria could be minimized. Jauregg received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1927. K is for Killer Malaria is a life-threatening disease but it is preventable and curable if the right steps are taken. Education in recognizing the symptoms has reduced the number of cases in some areas by 20 percent. Recognizing the disease in the early stages can stop the disease from becoming a killer. L is for Laser gun U.S. scientists say they are developing a laser gun that could kill millions of mosquitoes in minutes. The laser fires at mosquitoes once it detects the audio frequency created by the beating of wings, the lead scientist on the project told CNN. The project is being funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. M is for Mosquitoes Malaria is caused by the bite of the female Anopheles mosquitoes. The mosquitoes bite between sunset and sunrise and parasites from the mosquito are then injected into the person's skin and transported to the liver. About 170 species of such parasites exist, but only four cause malaria in humans. N is for Nets The distribution of mosquito nets with insecticide is a very effective method of malaria prevention, and it is also one of the most cost-effective methods. These nets can often be obtained for around $3. Earlier this month, actor Ashton Kutcher won a Twitter race against CNN to reach 1 million followers. Kutcher had pledged 10,000 mosquito nets to charity if he beat CNN, and 1,000 if he lost. CNN agreed to do the same. O is for Obstacles In many endemic areas, access to health facilities, as well as drug costs, still present major obstacles. Humanitarian agency Medecins Sans Frontieres estimates that the cost of treating a malaria-infected person in an endemic country was between $0.25 and $2.40 per dose in 2002. P is for Pandemic For malaria to become a pandemic (plague) in an area, several factors have to be present: high human population density; high mosquito population density; high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. Q is for Quinine Quinine was the first effective treatment for malaria in the 17th century. Since the 1940's, many other anti-malarial drugs have appeared on the market and have taken precedent over quinine. But quinine is still being used to treat malaria in some cases. R is for Repellent The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says inspect repellents with DEET (most common active ingredient in strong insecticides) in them should be used on exposed skin and flying-insect spray can be used to kill mosquitoes in the sleeping area. DEET may be toxic, however and should be used with care. S is for Symptoms Fever is not the only symptom of malaria. Other symptoms can include shivers, headaches and nausea. Sweating and exhaustion is also common and in some cases, it can affect the brain or kidneys. T is for Tablets Malarone is a common anti-malaria drug among many travelers. It is said to have a 97 percent efficacy with relatively few side-effects. It can be given just one day before arrival in a malaria endemic country and only needs to be taken for another week after leaving. U is for Unborn child According to the WHO, pregnant women are at high risk of contracting malaria. The illness can result in high rates of miscarriages and cause more than 10 percent of maternal deaths annually. This figure can rise to 50 percent in cases of severe disease. V is for Vaccine Despite intensive research, no effective malaria vaccine has been developed to date. But according to a report in April's New Scientist journal, a unique vaccine taken from the saliva of infected mosquitoes has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be tested in people. W is for World Malaria Day April 25 has become World Malaria Day to provide a global effort to control malaria around the world. The international malaria community only has two years left to meet the 2010 targets of delivering effective protection and treatment to all people at risk of malaria, as called for by the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon. X is for X-ray X-ray microscopes are used to find the presence of malaria in red blood cells and see how they interact with healthy cells. One of the advantages of this type of microscope is that it produces very-high-resolution images of the cell structure. Y is for Yellow fever Yellow fever is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes. Some countries, such as Peru, require a certificate showing yellow-fever vaccination before you can travel there. Z is for Zanzibar Zanzibar, part of the African republic of Tanzania, has had relative successes in combating malaria; Africa's biggest killer according to the New Scientist journal. The achievements are due to the widespread use of treated bed nets, along with the switch to new anti-malarial drugs instead of Chloroquine in 2004.","World Malaria Day on April 25 highlights the danger of malaria and calls for action .
According to the WHO there were 247 million cases of malaria in 2006 .

"NORTH ATTLEBOROUGH, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Ron Hassell stares at one really worn-out brown leather loafer. Ron Hassell has seen his share of heels. And soles. His grandfather taught him the shoe-repair trade. ""This is a shoe I don't want to tackle,"" he grimaces as his finger traces holes on the bottom. ""I tried to talk the guy out of fixing it, believe it or not."" The cobbler grabs a tool to rip off the entire sole. ""Some guys get a favorite pair of shoes. ... as you can tell, this guy wore this one to death."" He brings one of the shoes to a grinder that files down the last of the old sole and heel. ""It'll look brand new when I'm done,"" Hassell says. Hassell's shoe repair business, tucked into the corner of a three-story building in downtown North Attleborough, Massachusetts, is a trade and a tradition. The shop he now owns, North Shoe Repair, once belonged to his grandfather, who taught him everything he knows about being a cobbler. ""He was one of the best,"" Ron says, and he knows this because that's what all the salesmen -- the ones who sold products to all the local shoe repair shops -- would tell him. There are not a lot of cobblers left in the area, but Hassell's business has been steady and has even picked up in the last year. He sees the economy as one reason. It's far more economical to spend $12.50 on a pair of $125 shoes than to buy new ones. Hassell, however, sees another reason for being busy. With few young people entering the trade, customers seek out cobblers when theirs retire. ""I used to be the youngest that I knew of, because I started when I was twenty. Of course I'm close to fifty now, and I'm still probably one of the youngest around here.""  Watch the craftsman at work Â» . He continues to work on the really beat-up pair he didn't want to face. He uses special cutting and sewing machines to attach new leather to the bottom. Glue is pasted onto parts and the grinding machine is visited several times, both to sand off rough edges and later to polish them to a shine. He'll go back and forth to the various shoes that have been brought in and stop to wait on people bringing in his next challenge to repair. His customers seem satisfied with the results they get, and some have been loyal to his business for years. ""I came when his grandfather was here,"" says Inez Cavallaro, who had come to the shop to pick up a pair of sandals Hassell had fixed. ""I hope he always stays here, because he's great. ""He has done some magical things for me."" The comments don't go unnoticed by Hassell. ""You know, what's pretty cool is, customers, they get pretty happy. You get that all the time, and it makes you feel good."" Using an old shoe brush to polish what had started the day as a hopeless pair of old shoes, Hassell puts the final touches on what now look like shoes just bought from a store. ""Better than I thought they were going to come out,"" he says, looking them over one last time. Hassell says he enjoys his craft because he knows what he does is appreciated. As one customer leaves his shop and says goodbye, she stops in the door and turns around. She looks back at Hassell and says, ""Don't go out of business, now!"" As long as he can, that's something Ron Hassell has no intention of doing.","Shoe-repair business is a trade and a tradition in small Massachusetts shop .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- One summer night in 2004, 3-year-old Riley Fox lay asleep on a couch not far from her 6-year-old brother on a chair in the living room. Their father was sleeping in a nearby bedroom. The FBI joined the search for the killer of 3-year-old Riley Fox last month. Just before 8 a.m., Kevin Fox was awakened by his son. The boy told his father that Riley was missing from the sofa. Fox searched for his daughter for 40 minutes inside and outside their Wilmington, Illinois, home and then called police, according to authorities. His wife, Melissa, was in Chicago participating in a charity walk, and when she found out, she rushed home. Nearly 500 volunteers, along with police and family, searched for the little girl. Her body was found later that day in a river in Forked Creek, Illinois, just 4 miles from the family's home. She'd been bound and gagged with duct tape, raped and drowned, according to the Will County Sheriff's Office and the coroner's report. It was June 6, 2004, the start of a horrific ordeal for the family. Fox was arrested and charged with the killing, only to be exonerated by DNA evidence. More than five years later, authorities have yet to capture Riley's killer. Kathleen Zellner, Fox's attorney, said that the crime scene was brutal and that the theory is that Riley was snatched from her home, sexually assaulted and then thrown from the bridge overlooking the river where she drowned. Because her hands were bound and her mouth covered with duct tape, she was unable to swim or save herself, Zellner said. According to Zellner, Fox says that the night his daughter disappeared, he had gone to a street fair while the children's grandparents looked after them. On his way home, about midnight, Fox picked up his two sleepy children from their grandparents and put them to bed in the living room of the 500-square-foot cement box family home. Riley often fell asleep on the sofa and her 6-year-old brother on the chair near her while watching TV, Zellner said. Fox has said the front door was wide open when he awoke, Zellner said, as was the back door. He has said he locked the front door before he'd gone to bed. The back door's lock had been broken weeks ago; they typically propped a stack of laundry baskets against it to keep it shut. According to the family, those baskets had been removed and placed on top of the laundry machine by someone other than family members. ""From the beginning, we believed that someone was already inside the house waiting when Kevin got home with the kids that night, "" Melissa Fox said. ""But it was clear that police were looking at Kevin suspiciously."" Indeed, five months later, Will County sheriff's officers arrested and charged Kevin Fox with the sexual assault and murder of his daughter. Zellner says the arrest came after authorities coerced a confession from him after 14 hours of relentless questioning. Fox spent eight months in jail, but DNA evidence from the rape kit conducted on Riley's body finally exonerated him. There was no semen found during the autopsy, Zellner says, but saliva of an unidentified male was found on the duct tape covering Riley's mouth and elsewhere on her body. In late 2007, the family won a $15.5 million wrongful-arrest suit against the sheriff's detectives. The Foxes believe that the perpetrator was someone in the community who had been watching and targeting their daughter for some time. ""For weeks before her disappearance, I couldn't shake a feeling of uneasiness, strange noises at night outside our house, as if someone were lurking and watching us,"" Melissa Fox said. Zellner believes that another big clue was a red car similar to a Chevrolet Cavalier parked outside the Fox home that night, before Kevin Fox and his children returned home. ""It's only been in the last few weeks that investigators have actively begun pursuing this case again,"" Zellner said, ""even though Kevin was cleared nearly four years ago."" Last month, the FBI joined the investigation at the request of Will County State Attorney James Glasgow. FBI agents combed Riley's neighborhood and talked with neighbors and other potential witnesses. ""The FBI is bringing unprecedented resources and expertise to this investigation,"" Glasgow said in a statement. ""We cannot allow this horrific crime against an innocent child to remain unsolved."" The family is offering a $100,000 reward, and the FBI is offering $10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for Riley Fox's death. Anyone with more information is urged to call the FBI's Chicago office at 312-421-6700.","FBI joins investigation into death of 3-year-old Riley Fox, slain in 2004 .

"(CNN) -- An audio message purportedly from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has accused President Barack Obama of being unable to fulfil his election pledge to pull U.S. troops out of Iraq. Osama bin Laden is seen in an image taken from a videotape that aired on Al-Jazeera in September 2003. The tape emerged on radical Islamist Web sites, just two days after the United States marked the eighth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. ""To the American people, this is my message to you: a reminder of the reasons behind 9/11 and the wars and the repercussions that followed and the way to resolve it,"" the message said. ""From the beginning, we have stated many times ... that the cause of our disagreement with you is your support of your allies, the Israelis, who are occupying our land in Palestine. Your stance along with some other grievances are what led us to carry out the events of 9/11."" The video plays the audio over a undated photograph of bin Laden. The video also shows a banner with the American flag as the backdrop and an image of the New York City skyline with the twin towers of the World Trade Center -- destroyed in the 9/11 attack -- still standing, said terrorism analyst Laura Mansfield. CNN could not independently authenticate bin Laden as the speaker in the 11-minute video posted on Sunday by As-Sahab Media -- al Qaeda's production company.  Watch CNN's Octavia Nasr's analysis of the message Â» . Obama was ""a vulnerable man who will not be able to stop the war, as he promised, but instead he will drag it to the maximum possible extent,"" the message said. Though U.S. troops no longer patrol Iraq's major cities and a large number have left, tens of thousands remain in the country and are expected to stay for years to come. The message claims that the Obama administration is under the influence of the Republican White House it replaced, pointing out that the president kept Robert Gates as defense secretary -- a holdover from the Bush administration. ""Prolong the wars as much as you like. By God, we will never compromise on it (Palestine), ever,"" the message continued. Mansfield noted that the video brings no new images of the elusive bin Laden, who was last seen in footage two years ago on the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks. Bin Laden has released audio messages since then, most recently on June 9.","Obama is ""vulnerable man who will not be able to stop the war as he promised""

"(CNN) -- US Airways Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and First Officer Jeffrey Skiles were reunited in the cockpit Thursday for the first time since Sullenberger safely landed a disabled passenger plane in the Hudson River in January. Thursday's flight was Chesley Sullenberger's first in his new role as an active management pilot for US Airways. ""It was great to fly with Jeff again. Being back in the cockpit felt very familiar. It was like coming home,"" Sullenberger said of the flight from New York's LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Even though several months had past since I've flown, it would seem like I had never left."" It was the first time Sullenberger had flown the New York to Charlotte route since the water on landing on January 15. A bird strike in the engines forced Flight 1549 to make an emergency landing in the icy waters between New York and New Jersey. The landing made heroes of Sullenberger and the flight's crew, who managed to lead passengers to safety with only a few minor injuries.  Watch Sullenberger talk about the flight Â» . Sullenberger has been honored with numerous awards, appeared on the ""Late Show With David Letterman,"" spoke before a joint session of Congress and even went to the Super Bowl. Sullenberger said that, after the incident, he wanted to be reunited in the cockpit with Skiles and complete the flight. Cheers filled the cabin when Sullenberger introduced himself, adding he had ""learned to wait"" for applause to die down before giving preflight announcements. Four passengers from Flight 1549 returned for Thursday's trip, putting their lives once again in the hands of the man they affectionately call ""Sully."" Christie Spears, who survived the ""miracle on the Hudson,"" reserved the same seat for today's trip. ""What better flight to be on? What better captain to fly with? I wouldn't choose any other one,"" she said. Barry Leonard, a regular commuter on the New York-Charlotte route, said the flight was a healing process for him. Other passengers said they felt like they were taking part in a historic event. With ""Sully"" at the controls, Pat Martinez said she felt like she won the lottery. ""It was a smooth, calm flight -- just what you would expect from Sully."" Thursday's flight also was Sullenberger's first in his new role as an active management pilot for US Airways. In addition to his flying duties, Sullenberger will join the airline's flight operations safety management team, which helps airlines assess potential risks and act to mitigate them, US Airways said. Both men took time off before returning to the cockpit, US Airways said, during which they completed requalification training. Skiles returned to work in April, US Airways said. Since then, he has flown more than 60 flights. Sullenberger completed his training September 11, and since the crash, he has flown two flights between Charlotte and Atlanta. Sullenberger said he plans to step back from his flying duties while he goes on a book tour in two weeks and starts teach other pilots at the flight training school. Skiles said that even after eight months away from the controls, Sullenberger did everything perfectly, even reaching over to his radio to change the frequency. Sullenberger said the clear skies and nice weather made Thursday's flight go smoothly. ""It was a beautiful day to fly,"" he said. ""This flight today was a lot longer than that one in January, and I was able to give [CEO Doug Parker] back his airplane without getting it wet first.""

"(CNN)  -- White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel dismissed questions about whether President Obama is being overexposed with his recent media blitz, saying Tuesday that the American people want to hear what Obama is doing about a struggling economy. Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel says President Barack Obama is using the media to keep citizens informed. Speaking to CNN's Larry King moments after Obama finished a prime time news conference, Emanuel said people are talking about issues like jobs, education and health care, and want to know where their president stands. ""You can say maybe there's overexposure,"" Emanuel said. ""I think if you watch and see, there have been greater audiences for the shows he has been on to answer these questions, because these are the questions the American people are asking around their kitchen tables."" In the past week, Obama has appeared on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" and NBC's ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,"" the first appearance by a sitting president on a late-night talk show. He fielded questions for an hour at Tuesday's news conference and also appeared last week on ESPN filling out his bracket for the NCAA men's basketball tournament. Some analysts say the president risks diluting his message in the public's mind by being visible so frequently. Some Republicans and other critics have accused Obama of maintaining a campaign mentality when he needs to be governing. But Emanuel said a public anxious about the economy has largely rejected those notions. ""I think in this troubled time ... the American people expect the president to talk to them, walk them through his thinking -- why he makes the decisions he makes, what are the tradeoffs to those decisions -- and carry them through this process,"" he said. ""I think they're very engaged in this conversation. If you look at the data, they are involved in this conversation and interested in this dialogue and appreciate an adult conversation with them about the changes they're making and the changes their government and their elected leaders are making on their behalf.""","Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel says president using media to spread message .

His online Nonverbal Dictionary is used around the world as a reference tool. Barack and Michelle Obama celebrate winning the Democratic nomination with a fist bump in 2008. SPOKANE, Washington (CNN) -- The H1N1 swine flu virus is putting our most familiar gesture of greeting -- handshakes -- at risk. As an anthropologist who watches people for a living, I can tell you that human beings touch their own faces with their own fingertips hundreds, if not thousands of times a day. Repeated face touching -- especially finger contact with eyelids, lips, and nostrils -- is as predictable as blinking. You'll observe hand-to-face gestures in every culture and society, as well as in our closest primate relatives, the monkeys and apes. There's nothing wrong with face touching. Nothing, that is, unless you're afraid of germs. And today, many of us around the world are terrified by these tiny organisms, especially ones that cause swine flu. Merely by shaking the hand of someone infected by the swine-flu virus, we risk infection each time we inadvertently reach up and touch our faces. Physicians urge that we wash right after shaking hands. But since the anthropologist in me knows that, as a primate, you'll touch your face before washing, germs will inevitably visit unsuspecting lids, lip, and noses. The human handshake itself, meanwhile, is a widespread gesture used for meeting, greeting, and sealing a deal. It's a ritualized gripping of another's hand, with one or more up-and-down (or, in Texas, sideways) motions followed by a quick release. Since the fingertips and palm of the hand are exquisitely sensitive, the shake itself can be deeply personal. We instantly feel the warmth or coolness, dryness or moistness, and firmness or weakness of another's grip. Sensory input from a hand's thermal and pressure receptors to the brain's sensory cortex and then to deeper, emotional brain areas can be intense. If you travel to France, be prepared to shake hands dozens of times a day. Office workers in Paris, for example, may shake in the morning to greet, and in the afternoon to say goodbye, to colleagues. Outside vendors and technicians will handshake with everyone present when they enter or leave an office. The risk of hand-carried flu virus is thus greater here than it is in the United States, where handshaking is far less frequent. Contrast this to the Japanese practice of giving fewer handshakes, still, in favor of polite bows of the head. In all three nations, casual face touching is frequent, but germs in Tokyo are less apt to spread through handshakes. In Islamic nations, it is strictly taboo for men to shake hands in public with women. So, Muslim couples are less likely to exchange swine-flu germs through manual contact than are business men and women in, say, Seattle, Washington. Since in much of the world a handshake is both a visual and a tactile index of your concern for other people, it's hard to hold one back. In North America, Latin America, and Europe, when someone holds out a hand, it's difficult not to just take a step forward and shake. You don't want, after all, to seem rude. In Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East, handshaking may be more nuanced than in the West, or even absent. An Asian namastÃ©, with your palms and fingers pressed together in front of your chest, given with a slight bow -- or a Muslim salaam, in which your right hand touches your forehead, also given with a slight bow, may be proffered instead of a handshake. While you'll see the same incidence of facial touching -- to wipe a lip, relieve tension, or scratch an itch -- the fingertips themselves won't carry germs born of handshakes. So, what are we face-touchers in the rest of the world to do? Are we doomed to spread flu germs through our practice of ritually of gripping each other's hands? The short answer is no. Thanks to a pair of the planet's most well known human primates, we now have a healthier hand sign with which to meet and greet. Since the Obama-Lama ""fist bumps"" have been so well publicized of late, I'm sure you've seen it in newspapers and magazines and on Web sites and TV. Primates are the most imitative of all of Earth's animals, so don't be surprised if you find yourself bumping fists -- a lot -- in the weeks and months ahead. On September 22, 2009, the Dalai Lama was welcomed to Memphis, Tennessee, not with a handshake but with a fist bump from interim Memphis Mayor Myron Lowery. The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader balled up his fist and reached it forward to make friendly contact with the mayor's own proffered balled-up fist. From his smiling face, I could tell the Dalai Lama enjoyed his new greeting ritual. It looked as if he were playing with the cue. Though it was unclear if either of the fist-bumpers had flu phobia, that they touched with the knuckles instead of the fingertips rendered disease transmission far less likely. A year earlier, on June 3, 2008, then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama tenderly fist bumped with his wife Michelle, in what The Washington Post called ""the fist bump heard 'round the world."" That a U.S. president publicly performed the fist bump -- a gesture that originated partly from the sportsman's palm high-slap of victory and partly from the Black Power fist of the 1970s -- has given the gesture staying power, even though some people were critical of its use. It will last considerably longer than Andy Warhol's ""15 minutes of fame."" Thanks to Barack Obama, the Dalai Lama, and the swine flu, the fist bump will surely show up at a greeting near you. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Givens.","David Givens: H1N1 flu is prompting focus on how we greet each other .

"San Juan, Puerto Rico (CNN)  -- Investigators don't know if the massive fire at a fuel storage facility near San Juan was deliberately started or was an accident, the agent in charge of the FBI's San Juan office said Monday. The blaze, which started with an explosion at the Caribbean Petroleum Corp. facility in Bayamon municipality early Friday, was extinguished Sunday, firefighters said. Some of the tanks continued to smolder and crews stood ready to fight any flare-up. ""We don't know if it's a crime scene,"" said FBI Special Agent Luis Fraticelli. ""We don't know if it's an accident, so we're not making any determinations at this point until our experts do their work, do their analysis and then provide input to us as to what they feel happened here."" Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. The FBI is investigating graffiti found on two San Juan tunnels that referred to a fire, Special Agent Harry Rodriguez said Friday. A spray-painted message on the tunnels, less than three miles apart, said: ""Boom, fire, RIP, Gulf, Soul, ACNF."" Caribbean Petroleum owns the Gulf Oil brand, but Rodriguez said he did not know what ACNF referred to. Hundreds of firefighters battled the blaze, which began with an explosion early Friday morning. That explosion shook the ground with the force of a 2.8-magnitude earthquake, authorities said. Flames shot into the air while plumes of thick, black smoke hovered over the region. Agents from the FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were investigating to determine whether the explosion was an act of sabotage or an accident. Seventeen tanks were destroyed by flames and the initial explosion. Puerto Rico's governor, Luis Fortuno, said the main priority of his government is to counter any long-term effects of air and water pollution caused by the disaster. Representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency have been checking air quality near the fire. ""We're not finding levels that would be of concern,"" said Bonnie Bellow, EPA spokeswoman. She said the fire had been so intense because it was ""burning off chemicals that are part of the fuel."" About 600 displaced people stayed in shelters on Sunday night, but many were being sent home. Dr. Lorenzo Gonzalez, Puerto Rico's health secretary, tests conducted on the air and water showed no reason for concern. Because they were placed in close proximity in the facilities, everyone in the shelters and all the emergency personnel were vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus as a precaution, Gonzalez said. President Obama declared an emergency in Puerto Rico, which frees up federal aid. Fortuno said the blaze has cost the island at least $6.4 million. The governor sought to allay fears over gasoline supplies. Caribbean Petroleum owns 200 gas stations in the island and several inland distribution facilities, and supplies much of the island's fuel. Puerto Rico will receive 3.6 million gallons of regular gasoline, more than 1 million gallons of premium gasoline and more than 1 million gallons of diesel fuel to help make up for what may have been lost, Fortuno said. The company has been cited for violations of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the main law in the United States that deals with the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, according to EPA spokeswoman Bellow. Caribbean Petroleum is under a corrective-action plan, she said. CNN's Rafael Romo and Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","Blaze started with massive explosion early Friday .

"(CNN) -- What's it really like to be a new member of the world's most powerful legislature? Two new U.S. representatives are teaming up with CNN.com to report their ""Freshman Year"" experience through videos and commentaries. Jason Chaffetz and Jared Polis are taking video cameras with them as they negotiate their way in the 111th Congress, both inside and outside Washington. They both won convincing victories in November in neighboring states, yet they are world's apart. Utah's Chaffetz is a conservative Republican married father of three who is sleeping on a cot in his congressional office to save money. Democrat Polis from Colorado is a former Internet entrepreneur who is one of the wealthiest members of Congress and the first openly gay male to be elected to the House of Representatives as a freshman. You can follow their stories regularly on CNN.com.  Watch the action in Congress from the point of view of the Congressmen Â» . Here are their biographies: . â¢ Jason Chaffetz . Rep. Jason Chaffetz is a freshman Republican congressman representing the 3rd District of Utah. He was elected in November, winning two-thirds of the vote against a Democratic challenger. Chaffetz, 41, got the Republican nomination in an upset victory over Rep. Chris Cannon. He ousted the six-term incumbent in a low-budget campaign in which he said Cannon was not conservative enough for the district, particularly in fighting illegal immigration. Chaffetz grew up in California, Arizona and Colorado and was recruited to Brigham Young University to be a placekicker by football coach LaVell Edwards. He set two school records as the starting placekicker and earned a degree in communications. After college, Chaffetz joined the local business community and worked as a spokesman for Nu Skin International. Chaffetz stayed at Nu Skin for nearly 11 years, as managing director of marketing and product development and general manager for Australia and New Zealand.  Watch the reports from Week One Â» . Chaffetz managed Jon Huntsman Jr.'s campaign for governor of Utah and after Huntsman took office in 2005, he became his chief of staff. He has been married to Julie Johnson for 18 years and they have three children. â¢ Jared Polis . Rep. Jared Polis is a freshman Democratic congressman representing the 2nd District of Colorado. He was elected in November to the seat held by Mark Udall, who ran and won for U.S. Senate. Polis defeated his Republican opponent, gaining 62 percent of the vote. His campaign stressed environmental issues, education reform, withdrawing troops from Iraq and repealing Bush administration tax cuts for the highest-income earners. He is the first openly gay male to be elected to Congress as a freshman. Polis, 33, was born in Boulder, Colorado, and grew up in Colorado and Southern California. He was a student at Princeton University when he co-founded a company providing Internet access and Web hosting. Growing up in his family's Boulder-based greeting card and publishing business, Blue Mountain Arts, he succeeded his grandmother as sales manager in 1996 and helped start bluemountainarts.com, an online greeting card Web site. In 1998, he launched ProFlowers.com, a Web company to sell flowers direct from growers to consumers; its parent company was sold to Liberty Media Corporation in 2006. Jared won statewide election in 2000 to the Colorado Board of Education and served for six years. He started a foundation and two charter schools to support improvements in education and received numerous awards for his philanthropic work. Immediately before running for Congress, Polis served as superintendent of New America School, a charter school he founded to help 16-21-year-old new immigrants learn English and gain a high school diploma.","Two freshman representatives document their experience for CNN .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal officials will travel to Standish, Michigan, on Thursday to tour a state prison that could be used to house terror suspects detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, U.S. government officials said Wednesday. The prison in Standish, Michigan, is slated for closure but would stay open if Guantanamo detainees are sent there. Among those who will check out the facility, the officials said, will be representatives from the departments of Defense and Homeland Security, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Prisons. One administration official stressed no decision has been made about where to relocate Guantanamo detainees. Multiple options are under consideration. That official added Thursday's visit is simply to gather information about the prison. The prison in Standish is a maximum security facility slated for closure. Some local officials would like to see Guantanamo prisoners brought there as a way to keep the prison open and preserve jobs in an area with more than 20 percent unemployment. Jerry Nelson, mayor pro tem of Standish, told CNN earlier this month that the area would lose 350 jobs if the prison closes. ""I think most people are for this,"" Nelson said. ""Anything to keep the prison open."" Another location often mentioned for housing Guantanamo prisoners is a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Republican Sen. Sam Brownback and other officials vehemently oppose placing prisoners there. ""This local community has spoken loud and clear repeatedly,"" Brownback said in a news conference in Kansas this month. ""They don't want the detainees here."" Administration officials have said they are looking at installations that could hold courtrooms for federal criminal trials as well as military commissions. President Obama announced plans early in his presidency to close the U.S. military detention center at Guantanamo Bay by January. The center has 229 detainees.","Michigan prison seen as place where Guantanamo detainees could be relocated .

"(CNN) -- Clouds of black smoke from burning plastic hang over the sites of Nigeria's vast dumps, as tiny figures pick their way through slicks of oily water, past cracked PC monitors and television screens. Toxins from dumped electronics in developing countries has been seen as a growing problem. But it isn't just a cut from broken glass these mainly young scavengers are risking. Much of the discarded electronic kit contains tiny -- but valuable -- quantities of aluminum, copper, cadmium and other minerals, all of which can be sold on, if they can be recovered. However they also contain highly toxic materials, which have been linked to reproductive problems and cancers. ""People living and working on and around the dump sites, many of whom are children, are exposed to a cocktail of dangerous chemicals that can cause severe damage to health, including cancer, damage to the nervous system and to brain development in children,"" Kim Schoppink, Toxics Campaigner at Greenpeace, told CNN. ""The open burning creates even more hazardous chemicals among which are cancerous dioxins."" No studies have been done on the extent of the chemical pollution of such sites in Nigeria, but in 2008 a Greenpeace report on similar dumps in nearby Ghana confirmed that high levels of lead, phthalates and dioxins were present in soils and the water of a nearby lagoon. A Chinese academic report published in ""Environmental Health Perspectives"" in 2007 confirmed that children living in the same area had higher levels of toxic metals in their blood than other children living nearby. There is increasing evidence that this new health and environment problem is arriving in shipping containers from Western countries. Nigeria is one of the principal global destinations for ""e-waste"" -- the catch-all term for discarded consumer electronics. Some of this may have been legitimately handed in to be recycled in an EU or U.S. city, but lax enforcement, vague legislation and a lack of political will has meant that it instead passes through a network of traders keen to profit from developing countries' hunger for hi-tech and a burgeoning second hand market. According to the United Nations Environment Program around 20 to 50 million tons of e-waste are generated worldwide each year. In 2008 a Greenpeace study, ""Not in My Backyard"", found that in Europe only 25 percent of the e-waste was recycled safely. In the U.S. it is only 20 percent and in developing countries it is less than one percent. Extrapolating out from these figures the report concluded that a massive 80 percent of e-waste generated worldwide is not properly recycled. Some is burnt in Western incinerators or buried in landfill sites. But much is exported to developing countries including India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria and Ghana. When it arrives, a further percentage may be repaired and sold on to populations desperate for affordable technology. But anything beyond the skills of local traders will end up dumped. It's a profitable business, and is already attracting the attention of organized crime. A report issued by the United Nations in July said that the criminal gangs behind much of the drug trade in West Africa were becoming involved with e-waste trading. The volume of material on the move is staggering. In 2005, more than 500 containers full of e-waste entered Nigerian ports every month, according to the Basel Action Network, a U.S. NGO campaigning on issues surrounding toxic waste. Each one contains 10 to 15 tons of e-waste, totaling 60,000 to 90,000 tons per year. These figures are likely to have increased in recent years. There seems little doubt that much of this waste is finding its way to Africa from Western countries. The Basel Action Network and Dutch NGO Danwatch have traced equipment from Europe to Nigerian dumps and earlier this year Greenpeace placed a radio tracking device in a broken TV handed in for safe recycling in the UK, but followed it to a Nigerian market. ""Greenpeace is disappointed especially by U.S. and EU authorities,"" said Schoppink. ""It is toxic waste from the U.S. and EU countries that is causing serious environmental and health problems in Nigeria, a country without the means to deal with this problem. ""The U.S. and EU must play the biggest role in stopping the spread of e-waste; they are most responsible for the problem and have the resources to tackle it. The export of e-waste from the EU is illegal under the Basel Convention and the Waste Shipment Directive, but the laws are not being sufficiently implemented. In the U.S., there is no such law banning this practice. ""In Nigeria the government is talking about stopping imports, but there has been no progress on this to date."" Signs of progress . There are calls from environmental groups likes Greenpeace for electronics producers to do more to phase out their use of hazardous substances, and there are some signs of progress. Several electronics companies already make products using fewer hazardous substances, and others, including Nokia, Philips and Samsung are setting up voluntary collection and recycling systems in countries where they are not legally obliged to. Apple claims its products are now almost entirely free of the worst toxic chemicals. ""If producers continue to use hazardous chemicals in their electronics and to fail to take responsibility for the safe disposal of their products, e-waste will continue to be dumped in developing countries,"" said Schoppink. ""The pollution and related health problems in countries where e-waste is dumped will increase massively as the amount of electronics used worldwide is growing exponentially and the number of countries used as dump sites will grow."" But while the developing world needs the U.S. and EU to take responsibility for their waste, it also needs their discarded computers to train and build a 21st century workforce. ""Nobody is arguing that Africa should be denied access to computers,"" said Tony Roberts, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Computer Aid International, a charity licensed by the UK Environment Agency, which provides recycled computers to developing countries to improve education and healthcare. ""Technical colleges and universities are always short of resources. It is, of course, essential to developing economies escaping poverty to have access to affordable modern technology."" Computer Aid works to close the digital divide between the north and southern hemispheres and offers corporations, including Coca Cola, as well as individuals, a positive way of disposing of electronics. They also believe learning about responsibility for that technology is a crucial part of the exchange. ""Computer Aid argues that, in addition to the PCs, it is essential to also build the skills, knowledge and operating capacity in every country to manage responsible re-use programs and environmentally sound end-of-life recycling."" In the end, this is about everyone involved -- particularly the developed nations -- taking responsibility for their waste. ""It is clear that companies have a moral obligation to treat Africa in exactly the same way that they do, say, Germany,"" said Roberts. Until then, toxic black smoke will continue to cast a shadow over lives across the developing world.","Export of electronic products for recycling creating health and environment problems .

"(CNN) -- David Lance Arneson, who helped trigger the global phenomenon of role-playing games as co-inventor of ""Dungeons & Dragons,"" has died at the age of 61. A statement on the game's official Web site, wizards.com, said Arneson died Tuesday evening ""after waging one final battle against cancer."" Arneson ""developed many of the fundamental ideas of role playing: that each player controls just one hero, that heroes gain power through adventures, and that personality is as important as combat prowess,"" the statement said. The game's co-creator, Gary Gygax, died last year. In 1974, Arneson and Gygax created ""Dungeons & Dragons,"" which allowed players to assume roles in a magical world. They could be fighters or wizards, elves or dwarfs. ""As characters journey through various lands, they search for hidden treasures while battling menacing monsters with their own brains and brawn,"" a description on wizards.com says. Some games would last days or weeks -- or even longer. ""Game campaigns are as limitless as the player's imaginations,"" wizards.com says. What began as a hand-assembled print run of 1,000 games quickly sold out. Young people all over the world started buying up the game. By 1982, sales broke the $20 million mark. Arneson filed a series of lawsuits against Gygax insisting he was not being given credit or proper royalties for his work creating the game. The suits were settled. ""Dungeons and Dragons"" spawned video games, novels, a cartoon, and a movie. The franchise saw a surge this decade after ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter"" movies took off.","David Lance Arneson has died at the age of 61 .

"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- There was no trauma visible on the ""completely skeletonized"" remains of slain toddler Caylee Anthony, but there were overlapping pieces of duct tape over her mouth, according to the autopsy report released Friday. Caylee Anthony was last seen June 16, 2008.  Her mother, Casey Anthony, is in jail awaiting a murder trial. The tape was still attached to head hair, and the skull was separate from the other body parts, said Dr. Jan Garavaglia, chief medical examiner for Orange County. ""This duct tape was clearly placed prior to decomposition, keeping the mandible in place,"" she says in the report. Garavaglia said animals had scattered the bones after decomposition began. The cause of the child's death is listed as ""homicide by undetermined means."" Caylee Anthony's remains were found in December in woods less than a mile from her grandparents' home. Her mother, Casey Anthony, is charged with murder. She could be sentenced to death if convicted. The mother was arrested July 16, 2008, while Caylee was still missing. Earlier Friday, a judge denied a request from the child's grandparents, George and Cindy Anthony, to keep the autopsy report from the public. Last week, their attorney filed a motion saying the report should be sealed because its release would cause the family great anguish. Holding back tears, George Anthony on Friday asked the judge not to release the report until Casey Anthony's trial. ""Our family's memory of precious Caylee Marie is all we have left of her,"" he said as his wife appeared visibly shaken. Judge Stan Strickland said George Anthony's testimony was not lost on him, but according to the law he had no choice. ""Their pain means a great deal to me. I don't like the ruling I'm making, but it's one that I legally have to make,"" he said. George Anthony, angry after the ruling, left the courtroom before the hearing ended. The autopsy report contains no X-rays or photos of the remains.  Watch Nancy Grace's take on the coroner's findings Â» . According to Garavaglia, intermixed with Caylee Anthony's skeletal remains were two plastic garbage bags, a canvas laundry bag and a baby blanket with a Winnie the Pooh print. A pair of partially decomposed, multi-colored shorts were among the clothes, the doctor said. Two sets of cloth letters were found intermingled with plant material and debris. Garavaglia said the first set spelled ""big"" and the second group appeared to spell ""trouble."" ""The roots growing into the vertebrae and bags indicate the body was placed there months prior to being found,"" Garavaglia said. ""There is nothing inconsistent with the body being placed there soon after the date of [Caylee] being last seen alive."" George Anthony said he saw his granddaughter leave his house with her mother for the last time on June 15, 2008. Officials allege Caylee was killed by her mother a short time later. Since her arrest in July, Casey Anthony, 23, has remained behind bars in Orlando. The search for Caylee ended December 11, when a meter reader brought out a bag containing a skull from the woods. He said he had contacted police three times in August to report a suspicious bag in the area. A deputy was ultimately fired for not properly searching the area. The remains were confirmed through DNA testing to be those of Caylee Anthony.

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Two hundred thousand boats sat idle in Japan, as fishermen across the nation took to the streets on Tuesday to protest skyrocketing fuel prices. Fishermen rallied in Tokyo on Tuesday against skyrocketing fuel prices. The strike -- the first ever by the country's fishermen -- hopes to convince the government that without its intervention, rising fuel costs will kill the fishermen's businesses. Across Japan's fishing ports, fishermen simultaneously blew their whistles in a symbol of solidarity, and operations ground to a halt. Thousands of others rallied in downtown Tokyo, marching in circles around the fisheries ministry and chanting, ""We're dying,"" through bullhorns. The protesting fishing unions say fuel once accounted for 10 percent of a business' operating cost. It now accounts for 30 to 50 percent.  Watch the unions protest in the streets Â» . They want the government to provide subsidies to make up for the price hike. The demonstration was the latest in a wave of protests around the world over fuel prices. Masatoshi Wakabayashi, the minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, told reporters Tuesday morning that he ""understands the frustration of the fishermen."" He urged reforms within the fishing industry to decrease its reliance on oil, adding it would be ""difficult to compensate them for the hike in the price of oil."" The deep-sea tuna fishermen's association told CNN it might suspend operations for two to three months later this year, due to fuel price hike. Marine life has long been a staple food source in Japan. Last week, nearly 400 taxis brought traffic to a halt in Berlin, Germany, as drivers drove through the city in a protest over high fuel prices. Truckers in Vienna, Austria, also staged a protest last week. And earlier this month, hundreds of British truckers drove past Parliament to voice their anger about the high cost of fuel. India, France, Spain and South Korea have had similar protests.","Thousands in Tokyo marched in circles around the fisheries ministry .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A store owner in New York who is being hailed as a hero after rescuing a 4-year-old boy from a burning building said he plans to visit the child in the hospital Friday. Horia Cretan climbed up a fire escape and helped save a boy through the window of a burning building. Horia Cretan, who owns an electronics store in the Bronx structure where the fire broke out, also hopes to meet Christopher's parents for the first time, he told CNN's ""American Morning."" The boy is expected to recover, Cretan said. The child was taken to Jacobi Medical Center, where a nurse said she couldn't provide his condition. Cretan, who moved to the United States from Romania 15 years ago, said he was inside his store Wednesday when he heard a child's screams. It was about 4 p.m., he said, about the time children play outside after getting out of school, but he said the screams he heard were ""totally different."" He reached a fire escape and climbed to the fourth floor, where a firefighter handed the boy to him through a smoke-clouded window, video from the scene shows. ""What I was worried about is, is he still alive? Because his head just dropped, and he wasn't helping himself or helping me,"" Cretan said. ""He just couldn't hold his weight and he was unconscious."" While the firefighter was handing over the boy, other crew members were trying to get into the building's main entrance to make their way to the apartment where the fire was, the store owner said. Cretan covered himself and the boy with a blanket or curtain to shield themselves from falling debris and glass, which cut the boy on the leg.  Watch Cretan describe the rescue Â» . During the rescue, the boy's brother stood below, yelling, the rescuer said. Christopher was given oxygen on the ground and taken to the hospital. Cretan said it wasn't the first time he rescued someone. He said he rescued his sister from a fire in Romania that killed their father. The 33-year-old Cretan said he was 12 years old at the time. ""It was a sad story, a tragic moment at the time,"" he said, referring to the Romanian incident. ""And you know, it had an impact on people around the neighborhood like it does right now. It's amazing. This just skyrocketed."" Cretan said he's received messages across the globe about the Bronx incident. ""This has become famous because somebody happened to be on the corner with the camera pretty much. You don't do things like this for merit. The merit in itself is you save somebody,"" Cretan said. ""And the whole community's just being great. Adopting me like a son, and I'm a part of a big family and I'm happy to have them in my life.""","Horia Cretan says he was working in his store when he heard a child's screams .

"(CNN) -- The French spend more time eating and drinking than anyone else among the world's wealthy nations, a new study reveals. The study, by the Paris-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), found that the average French person spends nine hours sleeping every night, and spends two hours a day eating. On the other end of the spectrum, the average Japanese gets seven hours of sleep and also spends longer at work -- and getting to work -- than on leisure activities. And when it comes to food, Mexicans spend the least time: just over an hour a day. The survey looked at 18 countries among the organization's 30 members to see how people use ""that most fundamental of resources:"" time. The results were released Monday.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- One of America's pre-eminent political power couples made a rare joint appearance Friday, when Bill and Hillary Clinton took the stage at the former president's Clinton Global Initiative conference. Bill Clinton says his wife Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is the ""best public service our family has ever produced."" ""I want to begin by expressing my extreme indebtedness to the Clinton Global Initiative, to all of you who participated, for giving me the first chance I have had in a week to see Hillary,"" Bill Clinton told the audience of social activists and business leaders at the closing session of CGI, a week-long conference designed to find solutions to global problems through public and private partnerships. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was at the session to unveil a new State Department initiative on food security. As he introduced her, the former president was effusive in his praise for his wife, saying that her approach to food security -- helping farmers around the world grow their own food to earn income and alleviate poverty -- was much smarter than the decades-long policy of simply giving humanitarian aid and food to countries.  Watch Clinton pay tribute to his wife Â» . ""It was a wrong-headed policy. It persisted through Democratic and Republican policies alike, including mine. We were all wrong, and she is determined to reverse it,"" Bill Clinton said.  Watch portion of Anderson Cooper's interview with former President Clinton Â» . ""Most of what I know about what I do today, I learned from her and she has become the best public servant our family has produced,"" he added. ""I am very proud of her and honored that she came here."" Hillary Clinton, who received a standing ovation, had equally kind words for her husband. ""It won't surprise you to hear that I am very proud of my husband, and I think what he has invented and brought to life here is extraordinary,"" she said, adding that the new State Department food initiative, in part, was an idea she developed by seeing the kinds of partnerships the Clinton Global Initiative produced. The Clintons posed for a photo-op with State Department officials and executives from General Mills and other organizations, who pledged at the conference to start a program to help farmers around the world. And then, for fans of the former first couple, a rare treat. As she walked off the stage, Bill Clinton drew some more cheers when he gave his wife a kiss. Bill Clinton continued to read off the million-dollar commitments he received at the conference for additional social programs. Hillary Clinton left to meet with 15 ministers from the Caribbean.","Bill Clinton praises wife's approach to food security at global issues conference .

"(The Frisky) -- When I try to explain my ardor for HBO's trashy-fabulous soap opera ""True Blood"" to my dude friends, they either shrug and change the topic, or question whether I've been writing for ladyblogs for too long and am suffering from a form of Stockholm Syndrome. Dudes just don't dig bloodsuckers, since vampires pretty much look like girls. We prefer zombies, because we love chainsaws, flamethrowers, and samurai swords. And because, on some level, we know that besides being vehicles for sperm, our other important, if lesser, genetic imperative is to defend our loved ones from hordes of unthinking, flesh-eating metaphors for current social anxieties. To most guys, vampires are the monster movie equivalent of that sensitive man-sponge in college who plays acoustic guitar in order to seduce chicks. They're what you get when you cross your average Renaissance Fair enthusiast with a mosquito. And what's with their greatest weaknesses being most kinds of Italian food, Sunday school, and the sun, which helps flowers grow? Really? Why women find date-rapey parasites who wear capes compelling must have something to do with deeply primal fears. A vampire is a monster, who looks, acts, and talks like a man. Who is passionate, romantic, and tortured. To surrender to this character is to play with fire. The vampire, in many ways, is the prototype of the bad boy. Women love bad boys - they're exciting, and the chance to change him, to break him like a horse, must be an irresistible challenge. If self-destruction weren't seductive on some superficial level, then no one would ever need rehab. But I am like most guys in that I am a fan of zombie flicks. ""28 Days Later"" may possibly be my favorite movie ever. I'm also a fan of alien and robot movies, but more often than not, it seems women are more adept at dispatching those. Zombie movies indulge male power-fulfillment fantasies. We enjoy pretending to be dragon-slaying knights or bad-guy-perforating cowboys or Bruce Willis, saving our ex-wife from a skyscraper full of terrorists. The Frisky: Compliments guys take as insults . Before any feminist blood vessels burst, let me explain that this fantasy goes hand-in-hand with a male-specific fear that speaks to ancient genetic programming. That for all our swagger, testosterone, and machismo, we cannot protect those we love. The disaster call for women and children to evacuate first isn't chivalry, inasmuch as it's evolutionarily smarts. The women and children will continue the species; the men are disposable. We fear being useless, especially once we have issued forth our baby-making essence. The Frisky: Where all the good guys are . In ""True Blood,"" the vampire Bill has decided to change himself, to fight his ferocious nature. He struggles to be a better, um, corpse. He rejects the cold, bloodthirsty vampirism of his peers, and tries to embrace those human virtues he once had: selflessness, mercy, kindness, and justice. In some ways, he's less a vampire and more a superhero. Then he falls in love with someone he is told he shouldn't. And his love for Sookie, a human woman, is a choice he has made, regardless of the scorn heaped upon him by the undead and the living alike. He protects her, despite his fears that he is completely impotent, powerless to defend her from a world that despises them both. And she returns the favor, despite her fears that underneath sweet words and passion is an animal waiting to pounce. A little bit for men and women. The Frisky: Ways men try to impress women . I watch ""True Blood"" because chicks will dig it when I can talk about Eric and Maryann and Action Stackhouse; it's how I ""open"" a pick-up artist-style ""set."" My knowledge of ""True Blood"" will help me convince turbo-hotties to come back to my sweet fourth-floor walk-up in Queens, where I will love them forever, or until I have to call the unemployment office at 10 a.m., whichever comes first. Sigh. Oh forget it. I love this show, without condition. I love that Alan Ball followed up his twee meditation on mortality, ""Six Feet Under,"" with a show that's just about hot sexing and gratuitous gore. It's a soft-core comic book, nothing more, nothing less. I fully accept that there's a part of me that will always be a pear-shaped teenage goth girl. I mean, I'm reading the ""True Blood"" books, for the love of Godric. Horror movies, books, and television shows reflect our collective fears, and ""True Blood"" is awesome because it sneaks male fears into a female-oriented program. Also: because all the women are hot and sometimes they show their chest. TM & Â© 2009 TMV, Inc. | All Rights Reserved .","Writer says the vampire, in many ways, is the prototype of the bad boy .

"(The Frisky) -- About a year ago, a group of my closest friends got together in a basement apartment in Queens. It was a Saturday night in the dead of winter, and most of us were broke (the economy was crashing) and lazy (we didn't feel like trekking to a bar in the city). As we cracked open a bottle of wine and ate fresh-baked zucchini muffins, one of my friends decided to play us some records on the record player he had recently inherited from his parents. It turned out to be one of the best nights of our lives. In sharing great music, great food and great fun, a tradition was born: Record Party. The New York Times is finally catching on to something my friends and I discovered that night; vinyl is back in a major way. The stats say that CDs are becoming just about as obsolete as cassettes and 8-tracks. Sure, iPods are fun if you're on the go, but really the only way to devour your favorite music (other than to hear it live) is to listen to it on vinyl. It's like hearing the music again for the first time -- rich and layered. Mike Jbara, a bigwig at Warner Music Group, said, ""It is absolutely easy to say vinyl doesn't make sense when you look at convenience, portability, all those things. But all the really great stuff in our lives comes from a root of passion or love."" [New York Times] . That's what Record Party is really all about. But don't take my word for it. Here are five tips for throwing your own rocking Record Party. â¢ Yes, you need a record player. I know you're thinking, ""Where on earth do I get a record player? The antique shop?"" Try eBay or Craigslist. There are so many used record players that need a good home. From bottom of the line models to high-end turntables, you wouldn't believe how many people have record players. If you're an electronics idiot like me, you may want to consult a knowledgeable person. I always ask my super-geeky musician friends about makes, models and features. If you don't have a music nerd in your life, do a little research online or find a specialty store in your area. Also, don't forget to get some great speakers so you can hear all the natural flava of your records. â¢ Starting a record collection isn't as hard or as expensive as you think. It's always fun to go to a local record store and pick out some delicious vinyl. Many record stores have used records, which can save you some money. Take the record out and make sure that it's the right record -- one time I got ""A Chorus Line"" record in a ""Stevie Nicks"" jacket. Also, make sure that the record is not terribly scratched. If you're a bargain hunter like me, go to your local thrift store and pick through. You may have to search for a while, but it's not uncommon to find some $1 gems. Also, flea markets are a great place to find some hot, cheap vinyl. â¢ Keep the guest list small. The best thing about Record Party is reveling in your favorite music and breaking out your finest dance moves. This is always most fun with close friends who have similar tastes in music. But part of the fun is also learning about new music, so you may want to require guests to bring some records of their own. â¢ Food and drinks are a must. It's hard to throw a great record party without food and beverage. Have everyone contribute. Snacks and drinks will be much appreciated when guests step off the makeshift dance floor. â¢ Establish some rules and traditions. At our Record Party, we've established a couple of rules in order to keep the good times rolling: 1. Everyone must write all requests down on our request list. 2. No more than two songs played at one time per person. After everyone has put in a request, the cycle starts over. 3. Everyone gets one ""Yoinx"" per night. A ""Yoinx"" is when you have a great song that you feel like you need to push to the top of the list. Develop your own rules and traditions to ensure that everyone is able to share in the music. Enjoy. TM & Â© 2009 TMV, Inc. | All Rights Reserved .","Record Parties are a great way to get together with friends .

"MOGADISHU, Somalia (CNN) -- Chaos and death on the streets of Mogadishu: unfortunately, it's nothing new in the Somali capital. Casualties are taken into Mogadishu's hospital on stretchers. Government forces are fighting against insurgents on this day in September in a bloody battle that leaves 30 dead. Dozens of wounded Somalis are taken out of the danger zone, some of them in the back of insurgents' pick-up trucks. One of the trucks races through the streets, zig-zagging to the echoing booms of the ongoing shelling. The truck comes to an abrupt halt, stopping at a rare sight in the Somali capital -- an ambulance, waiting at the heart of the chaos to ferry the dead and the injured to the hospital. The wounded are transferred onto the ambulance. People shout and run as the mortar attacks continue. One woman screams over and over for her son. The ambulance is one of seven medical vehicles paid for with donated funds from local and expatriate Somalis. Residents can simply call for the ambulances without charge, and the vehicles will be dispatched to the scene. ""It is amazing,"" said Rufai Salad, one of the founders of the ambulance service in the Somali capital. ""We have this toll-free number, 777, that you dial. Someone is giving you a free call and then coming and giving you free help. ""People here find it hard to believe it is real."" Life Line Africa, a local Somali charity, started its ambulance service in Mogadishu in December, bringing a small amount of order to the lawless country that is in the midst of a brutal Islamist insurgency. Apart from the short-lived rule of the Islamic Courts Union in 2006, there has been no genuine central authority in Somalia since the collapse of Mohamed Siad Barre's repressive regime in 1991. Now, the United States and other Western powers are propping the U.N.-backed transitional government forces in their attempt to fend off the insurgency, particularly Al-Shabaab -- a Somali militant group that has ties to al Qaeda.  Watch Nima Elbagir's report on the humanitarian crisis in Somalia Â» . Basic amenities in Somalia, like electricity, water and sanitation - and even luxuries such as wireless Internet facilities -- are provided by enterprising businessman, which is partly how the ambulance service came to life. In the Somali equivalent of a public-private partnership, clan elders and local businessman donated the money to fund the ambulance service, helping fulfill a crucial need. The ambulance drivers are well compensated, earning about U.S. $200 a month in a country where the average yearly income is $130, according to the United Nations. Life Line Africa's monthly budget for its Mogadishu ambulance service is $3,200, including fuel, running costs and the salaries of the 10 drivers. They hope to increase their driving staff to 14. Salad, 24, is an information technology officer for the Somali president's office, but volunteers his time to help keep Life Line Africa running. His enthusiasm about the ambulance service obscures the very real danger he and his drivers face. Part of the problem, he explains, is trying to stay neutral in a war zone. ""We did have one driver killed by Al-Shabaab,"" he admits. ""They told us that it was because we were carrying government soldiers to hospital. But I said to them that this is what we do - we are working for all of you."" And it's not just the insurgents that Salad and his drivers fear. ""We had to take the body of a Syrian ship captain who had been killed by pirates to the airport,"" he said. ""The government and African Union soldiers opened fire on the ambulance. We were later told they'd received information that the insurgency was planning on using an ambulance to stage a suicide attack."" ""But what can you do?"" he asks. ""Our driver ran away and then later was allowed to come back for his ambulance."" Salad says the relatively high pay is not the real reason his drivers are willing to take the risks they do. ""If you go to the area of the fighting then the combatants [from both sides] say 'You must carry us to the hospital or we will kill you,'"" he says. ""It is so dangerous but when we see the problems of the people, we're trying to find a way somehow, to keep on working.""","Volunteer ambulance service ferries wounded civilians and fighters to the hospital .

"(CNN) -- Happy birthday, Catherine Zeta-Jones. You are turning 40 this month, joining an exclusive club of women in show business who are marking the same milestone this year. Catherine Zeta-Jones arrives at a Hollywood event earlier this year. She turns 40 on September 25. Think big names like Renee Zellweger, Jennifer Aniston, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez and Cate Blanchett. It's a birthday many actors -- but especially female stars -- in Hollywood would once dread, hide and agonize over. At an age where men could comfortably play heroes and lovers in the prime of their life -- and could do so for many years to come -- women often found themselves starting to be cast in different roles. (One example: ""The Graduate,"" where 36-year-old Anne Bancroft played a frustrated ""older woman"" trying to seduce Dustin Hoffman, who was just six years younger than she at the time.) No wonder some stayed mum about their age, but this generation of 40-something female entertainers is different. They're holding birthday bashes, embracing the big four-oh and staying as busy and famous as ever. Their faces grace magazine covers, their bodies are the envy of women decades younger and their careers seem to be going strong.  See photos of stars who are 40 and still hot Â» . Zellweger herself has said she hasn't noticed good parts getting scarce. ""I don't see it. I don't know. I'm so spoiled with respect to the experiences I've had and the opportunities I've had that I don't see it,"" she said, according to published news reports. So has anything changed for women hitting 40 in a business obsessed with youth? Industry observers say stars like Zeta-Jones, Zellweger and Aniston have more options than ever to have long, distinguished careers thanks to independent films and television, but opinions are mixed on whether they can sustain a big Hollywood presence. ""These women are still among the most bankable, biggest stars in the industry and turning 40 isn't going to change that,"" said Kathy Heintzelman, entertainment director for More, a magazine geared toward women over 40.  Watch a report on the most rich and famous women over 40 Â» . Importance of box office . But others argue that the opportunity to land lead roles in major studio films for actresses like Aniston, Zeta-Jones and Zellweger is running out. It's all about the global box office for Hollywood, which right now is most interested in making comic book movies or big-action, special-effect films in which women are mostly decorative, said Leah Rozen, film critic for People magazine. That often leaves few lead roles in big-budget Hollywood films for established female stars as they get older. ""They're going to work, but the entire movie will not be built around them. It will not be a Renee Zellweger vehicle or a Catherine Zeta-Jones vehicle, unless it's an indie film,"" Rozen said. ""I'm not saying anything about the quality of the movies they're making or their validity as actresses,"" Rozen said. ""I am saying that viewed as box office -- or can they open a movie? -- the answer would be no right now."" Zellweger's most recent project, ""My One and Only,"" which Rozen called a ""very sweet little film,"" has grossed less than $1 million since it premiered last month (it opened in wide release last Friday.) Earlier this year, her film ""New in Town"" grossed about $16 million domestically, according to Boxofficemojo.com. Zeta-Jones' last big Hollywood role was in the 2007 movie ""No Reservations,"" which earned $43 million in the United States. Aniston has had a better run. Last year's ""Marley & Me"" took in $143 million domestically and more recently, ""He's Just Not That Into You"" earned $93 million. Men are viable as box office leads far longer than most women, Rozen said. Think Harrison Ford, who was still the action hero at 66 in last year's ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (which earned $317 million domestically) or Sean Connery, who at 69 was paired with a then-30-year-old Zeta-Jones in 1999's ""Entrapment"" ($87 million domestic gross). A big exception to this trend has been Meryl Streep.  Watch a report on women over 40 who make us laugh Â» . Streep, 60, has a great track record at the movies with films including the recent ""Julie & Julia"" and last year's ""Mamma Mia!"" She's part of a very successful run of female-centric movies that have starred women over 40, said Jane Fleming, president of the nonprofit organization Women In Film. ""That proves if you have an audience base that wants to see you, they're going to keep coming out to see you regardless your age,"" Fleming said. ""What's been nice about the last two years is that there's been economic proof that that audience exists and that given the right form of entertainment, it will be very lucrative for the studios."" Fleming believes this is a good time to be turning 40 in Hollywood, with popular films like ""Sex and the City,"" ""Marley & Me"" and ""The Proposal"" starring 40-and-over actresses.  Watch a report on women over 40 who rock Â» . TV, indie films offer new options . It may be a big improvement over the options available to female stars not too long ago. ""There are only three ages for women in Hollywood: babe, district attorney, and 'Driving Miss Daisy,'"" Goldie Hawn's character famously exclaimed in the 1996 comedy ""The First Wives' Club."" Actresses like Sandra Bullock are redefining those stereotypes by playing lead roles in romantic comedies well into their 40s, sometimes paired with younger men. Just this year, Bullock, 45, has starred in ""The Proposal"" and ""All About Steve.""  Watch a report on women over 40 who've had work done Â» . Many actresses over 40 are also finding a new home on television, where there are many complex characters to choose from. Glenn Close, 62; Kyra Sedgwick, 44; and Holly Hunter, 51, are just some of the stars who have made the move from the big screen to the small screen, earning critical and popular success. ""Cable has opened up enormous possibilities. In feature films, you're still lucky if you're not the girlfriend or the wife,"" Katey Sagal, 55, who stars in the TV series ""Sons of Anarchy,"" recently told Oprah.com. But she was also glad to note that there are more opportunities in general for female stars over 40. ""I don't know why it's changed, but I'm really grateful it has. Maybe it has to do with the fact that we're all living longer and suddenly it's OK to get older. Maybe there's a broader audience for these characters. The stories you can tell about older women are deeper,"" Sagal said.","Renee Zellweger, Jennifer Aniston, Cate Blanchett have turned 40 this year .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Nearly 130 people were killed and more than 400 wounded early Tuesday when a string of five suicide car bombings hit government buildings, a neighborhood and a commercial district in Baghdad, Iraqi authorities said. Iraq's Finance and Labor ministries and a courthouse were the targets of three of the terror attacks, which shattered a two-month period of relative calm in the capital. By evening, Interior Ministry officials put the toll at 127 dead and 448 wounded, the worst since twin car bombings killed and wounded hundreds of people in late October. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said the attacks were aimed at undermining Iraq's upcoming elections, now set for March after a lengthy impasse in the country's parliament. ""The timing of these cowardly terrorist attacks in Baghdad today, after the success of Iraqi Parliament in overcoming the last obstacle in the election procedures, shows that the enemies of Iraq and its people are aiming to create chaos in the country and prevent any progress in the political process and to disrupt the procedures of the coming elections,"" he said. The first of the vehicles blew up in southern Baghdad's Dora district at about 10 a.m. (2 a.m. ET), followed by four more car bombs about half an hour later. Three of the explosions struck at the heart of the Iraqi capital, detonating a few minutes apart. One hit the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, while another hit the new site of the Ministry of Finance near al-Qashla Square. The ministry's former building was destroyed in a bombing in August. Another bomb exploded in the busy commercial district of Nahdha, and the fifth bomb blew up outside the Karkh Civil Court in western Baghdad's Mansour district. The sounds of sporadic gunfire and emergency sirens could be heard immediately following the attacks, and smoke from the blasts billowed into the morning sky. Suicide bombers carried out the five attacks, Brig. Gen. Qassim Atta, a spokesman for the Baghdad Operations Command, told CNN. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attacks and offered his ""heartfelt condolences"" to the families of those killed, according to a statement from his office. ""The Secretary-General appeals to the people of Iraq to remain steadfast in the face of these attacks and to continue their determined efforts to achieve national reconciliation,"" the statement said. ""The United Nations remains committed to supporting them."" And the human rights group Amnesty International said there was ""absolutely no justification"" for the bombings, noting that indiscriminate attacks on civilians are war crimes under international law. Suicide bombers were also blamed for the two bombings October 25 in Baghdad, which killed 160 people and wounded 540. Those bombs detonated in quick succession at mid-morning on a Sunday, the first day of the workweek in Iraq, in the Salhiya district of central Baghdad. The location was close to the Foreign Ministry. Government officials, including Baghdad's governor, questioned how the bombers were able to penetrate the area's security, which was supposed to have been improved in the months leading up to the attacks. Authorities subsequently detained more than 60 people responsible for security in the district where the bombings took place. And Tuesday's attacks sparked debate among Iraqi lawmakers about the capability of the country's security forces. Noor Aldeen al-Haiali, a member of Iraq's parliament from the country's largest Sunni Arab party, said al-Maliki's government ""failed in taking the measures to protect the targeted Iraqi citizens, who are shocked and getting slaughtered on a daily basis."" Ali al-Adeeb, a senior member of the prime minister's Dawa party, said security has improved in recent years. But Kurdish lawmaker Mahmood Othman told CNN that more attacks could be possible ""because the people against the political process, against the elections and against stability in Iraq"" will try to disrupt the elections. And he said stepped-up security measures won't be enough to deter them. ""There should be some political stability, political reform, reconciliation,"" he said. ""These are also very, very important to provide security."" CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Four car bombs explode in central Baghdad, killing nearly 130 and wounding hundreds .

"(CNN) -- For most Americans, mosquitoes are pests whose bites leave behind itchy bumps. But in other parts of the world, mosquitoes carry a disease called malaria that kills more than a million people each year. Mosquitoes, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa, may transmit malaria to humans. A new malaria vaccine that's about to begin human clinical trials is dependent on mosquitoes -- a whole lot of them. Bioengineers have been growing millions of mosquitoes in a sterile environment, letting them feed on malaria-infected blood, irradiating the bugs, extracting the disease-causing parasites and storing them for use in vaccines. The announcement of the Food and Drug Administration's approval for clinical trials comes just days before World Malaria Day, which is Saturday. Check out the World Health Organization's site about malaria goals worldwide . The vaccine is unique among other candidates in that it uses the entire parasite and not just parts of it, said Dr. Stephen Hoffman, chief executive and scientific officer at Sanaria Inc., the Maryland-based biotechnology firm developing the vaccine. This technique was first shown to be effective in the 1970s, but the technology didn't exist to mass-produce it for the millions of people who need it, said Dr.  Kirsten Lyke, principal investigator in the clinical trial site at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. At that time, people were immunized by being bitten by the irradiated mosquitoes. ""That is the only effective vaccine that anyone has ever really developed that works and does complete protection,"" said John Dame, chair of Infectious Diseases and Pathology at the University of Florida, who is not involved with the Sanaria trials. The vaccine takes the same basic approach as standard vaccines in use for diseases such as measles and polio. In those vaccines against viruses, weakened bacteria is injected, creating an immune response without causing illness. In the Sanaria vaccine, the body recognizes the malaria parasite as a foreign material, Lyke said. It goes to the liver, where a lot of the immune response is generated, but does not develop into a disease because the mosquito was irradiated, she said. Clinical trials will begin in May, Hoffman said, and will include 80 immunized individuals and 24 controls. About 3,000 mosquitoes were used to produce the vaccines for the first clinical trials, he said. If these trials are successful, researchers will initiate trials on adults in Africa, and then children. Among other vaccines in clinical trials currently, the one that is furthest along is RTS,S, developed by GlaxoSmithKline PLC. The company announced in December that this vaccine, based on a recombinant protein that uses part of the malaria parasite, was safely administered to African infants, with an efficacy of 65 percent in a three-month follow-up. Both the Sanaria and the GlaxoSmithKline projects receive support from the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative, a program at the nonprofit PATH established through an initial grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Dame, who used to be involved with the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine, said he would guess the Sanaria vaccine will be more effective, but clinical trials will provide more information. He also noted that mass distribution to developing countries would require appropriate infrastructure, and may be more difficult depending on how long the immunization lasts. Each year, 350 million to 500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most people who die from the disease are young children in Africa south of the Sahara. Symptoms of malaria include fever, chills and flu-like illness, the CDC said. Although preventive measures exist, such as insecticide-treated nets and medications, there is no licensed vaccine on the market. Moreover, effective treatments are largely too expensive for the people who need them in poor countries. The parasite has become resistant to cheaper treatments, Lyke said. ""Individuals living on $1 or $2 a day can't even afford $8 medication,"" Lyke said. The U.S. military also has a keen interest in a malaria vaccine. The antimalaria drugs available have side effects such as stomach aches, said Dr. Tom Richie, director of the Navy component of the U.S. military malaria vaccine program, who provides oversight to the clinical trials. ""Malaria has been one of the most significant infectious threats to our military personnel when we deploy to tropical areas,"" Richie said. The disease was the leading cause of casualties in the South Pacific theater during World War II, and also a major problem in the Vietnam War, he said. There are five species of the malaria parasite known to infect humans. One called Plasmodium falciparum causes the vast majority of cases. Malaria was eliminated in the United States in 1951, but there are still cases in the country, mostly from people who acquired it in high-risk countries. In 2002, there were 1,337 cases of malaria in the U.S., and all but five had been acquired abroad. An international team at the Malaria Atlas Project recently published what researchers say is the most comprehensive map ever illustrating global malaria risk. Researchers told CNN the map offers hope that it is possible to eradicate the disease in many parts of the world. Hoffman, former head of a U.S. Navy malaria vaccine team, started the Sanaria effort himself in the breakfast room of his house in 2003. The company now has a more official corporate headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. ""I thought that the world needed a malaria vaccine, there was no question this was the best way to make one,"" he said.","Sanaria Inc. is developing a malaria vaccine that uses the whole parasite .
Concept is akin to live virus vaccines, such as those for polio and measles .
The method had been tried in the 1970s but wasn't feasible on mass scale .
The most advanced malaria vaccine, by GlaxoSmithKline, has been tested in Africa ."
"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A soldier who reported for duty with her children in tow has been granted her request for a discharge, her lawyer said Monday. Lisa Pagan was recalled to the Army after being honorably discharged four years ago. Lisa Pagan, of Davidson, North Carolina, reported for duty Monday morning at Fort Benning, Georgia, with her two preschool children. She had been honorably discharged from active duty at the rank of specialist nearly four years ago but was recalled as part of the Individual Ready Reserve program. The former Army truck driver asked for a reprieve from deployment because her husband travels for business and they would have no one to care for their children if she was sent overseas. Until Monday, her request had been denied. Late Monday afternoon, Pagan's lawyer told CNN the Army would grant her request and begin the process of discharge again, this time for good. ""We are definitely heading in the right direction for Lisa and her family and her children,"" said Mark Waple, Pagan's attorney. ""She has been told by her chain of command they plan on doing everything they can within reason to do this as expeditiously as possible."" Pagan enlisted in 2002 and was honorably discharged from active duty in June 2005. She was never deployed. Before she left for Fort Benning, Pagan, 27, told CNN affiliate WCNC that her relatives weren't able to care for her children for various reasons, including her relatives' health. She said her family couldn't afford having her husband give up his job. They would lose their house, she told the Charlotte, North Carolina-TV station. ""I'm a human being. I need to take care of my children. They don't have anybody else,"" Pagan told WCNC. Since September 11, 2001, the Army has recalled about 25,000 soldiers. Nearly half requested a delay or a full exemption. Some just wanted to finish their school semester before reporting. Others had financial or medical problems that made it difficult to report for duty. The Army says it granted nearly nine out of 10 delay requests and six out of 10 requests for exemption.","Soldier reported for duty in Georgia on Monday with her two preschool children .

"BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN)  -- Saad Hariri, the leader of Lebanon's Sunni-dominated ""March 14 coalition,"" claimed victory hours after the polls closed in Sunday's crucial election. ""March 14"" coalition leader Saad Hariri claims victory after polls close Sunday. Results were not expected until midday Monday. ""What happened today proved again that Lebanon is doing well,"" said Hariri in a televised victory speech. ""The Lebanese proved again that they are holding on to their freedom and the democratic system, so congratulations to Lebanon, congratulations to freedom and to every voter who participated in this election. In this election, there is no winner or loser, democracy won today and the biggest winner is Lebanon."" Hezbollah officials did not challenge Hariri's speech. Al-Arabiya television network cited Hezbollah sources as predicting Hariri's March 14 coalition would win 70 seats, and that the Hezbollah-dominated ""March 8 alliance"" would win 58 seats. The election -- with 128 seats in parliament at stake -- was crucial in determining whether the Arab nation, scarred by war and political instability, picked the coalition led by Hariri or an alliance backed by the militant group Hezbollah.  Watch Hariri's victory speech Â» . Turnout was high among the country's 3 million registered voters during the 12 hours that polls were open Sunday. About 50,000 troops were on the streets, but the run-up to the balloting had been free of violence. Former U.S. President and Nobel Peace Prize Winner Jimmy Carter on Sunday said the United States should work with whichever coalition wins -- even though it considers Hezbollah, supported by both Syria and Iran, to be a terrorist organization. Carter was in Beirut as part of more than 200 international observers monitoring the election. Two senior Obama administration officials -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden -- have visited Lebanon in recent months, signaling concerns over a possible Hezbollah victory. Hezbollah grew in popularity after its militant wing claimed victory over Israel after a 34-day military conflict in 2006. Since then, it has been more widely perceived by its supporters to be the ""defenders"" of Lebanon. In Lebanon's unique power-sharing government, the presidency is reserved for Maronite Christians, the speaker of parliament is always a Shia Muslim, and the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim. The law was created to balance power among Lebanon's three main religious groups. Resident Georges Azzi, who cast his ballot early Sunday morning, hoped the elections bring about a smooth and healthy transition to a new government and the continued support of the West -- whatever the results. ""I think it would be seen as a punishment to everybody if it doesn't,"" Azzi said. ""We should accept the results whatever they are. That's how democracy works.""

"Newark, New Jersey (CNN)  -- A Transportation Security Administration officer has been reassigned after Sunday's security breach at Newark's Liberty International Airport, according to the TSA. ""The TSA is reviewing the circumstances surrounding the incident, and we are making an assessment as to what disciplinary action will be taken against [the] officer posted at the exit in question,"" TSA spokeswoman Ann Davis said. ""For now, that officer is performing non-screening duties while we look at what happened."" Davis confirmed Monday that the TSA had not been able to locate the individual who breached security, but there was no indication that the individual presented a serious threat, she said. ""We were able to eliminate that he was a risk to the airport by rescreening everyone and re-combing the airport to make sure he didn't introduce anything to the environment or hand anything off to anyone,"" she said. The incident Sunday evening forced the closure of a terminal for hours while authorities rescreened thousands of passengers. The security breach happened about 5:20 p.m. at Terminal C when a man walked through an exit on the public side to the secure ""sterile"" side for passengers who had cleared screening, according to the TSA. All passengers had been rescreened by early Monday, according to the TSA. Flights from Terminal C were grounded until the process was completed. Authorities reviewed video from airport cameras but were not sure whether the man was once on the sterile side and went back or whether he never went through screening, Davis said. The incident caused arrival delays and mainly affected Continental Airlines, which is the airport's largest tenant. iReport: Passenger photographs massive crowd . CNN's Alina Cho, who arrived at the airport Sunday night on a flight from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, described a hectic scene, saying many passengers who had boarded outgoing flights had to get off planes to be rescreened. ""I just saw one woman pleading with a gate agent, saying that she had two small children and a heart condition -- that she simply could not take this,"" Cho said. ""But of course, there will be no exceptions."" Newark Liberty International Airport, about 15 miles from Manhattan, is the second-largest hub for Continental. The airport handles approximately 35 million passengers a year.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- The leaders of Lebanon and Syria vowed to improve cooperation between their two countries Sunday, tying up a meeting aimed at thawing frozen relations. ""We want to open new horizons between the two states,"" Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri said at a news conference at the end of the two-day meeting, which happened in Damascus, Syria. ""We had good and excellent discussions based on mutual clarity and honesty,"" he added. ""We are betting on a better future for both countries and peoples, in economy, trade as well as all other levels."" Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was not at the news conference. Official Syrian news agency SANA reported that both al-Assad and Hariri ""saw the visit as a starting point to restore cooperation between the governments of Syria and Lebanon."" ""Both sides agreed that the institutions and ministries in both countries directly coordinate and communicate to remove all obstacles to the cooperation on all levels,"" SANA reported. Hariri has previously blamed Syria for the 2005 assassination of his father, Rafik Hariri, a former Lebanese leader who was a prominent figure opposing Syria's continuing presence inside Lebanon. A United Nations investigation found indications of Syrian involvement, but Syria denies responsibility. A U.N.-backed tribunal has been created to investigate the killing. The two leaders did not discuss that issue or the assassinations of other anti-Syrian figures in Lebanon, Hariri said Sunday. They also did not discuss requests by a Syrian court to question Lebanese officials. Asked whether any guarantees were exchanged regarding the Lebanese-Syrian relationship, Hariri responded, ""I don't want to go into details."" He added that the meeting proves ""a relationship is being built in both countries' interest and in the benefit of future openness."" A popular uprising after the elder Hariri's killing in 2005 helped lead to the withdrawal of Syrian forces after almost 30 years of military and political domination of Lebanon. Under international pressure, Syria opened an embassy in Beirut almost a year ago, and a Lebanese ambassador arrived in Damascus a short while later. It was the first time the two foes established diplomatic ties since their independence more than six decades ago. The United States, which also accused Syria of involvement in Rafik Hariri's assassination, withdrew its ambassador four years ago. President Obama decided to make an effort toward reconciliation and announced earlier this year that he was returning a U.S. diplomat to Damascus.","NEW: Lebanese leader: ""We are betting on a better future for both countries and peoples""

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- More than 400 people have been killed in a spate of violence in northern Nigeria, the president of a human rights group said Tuesday. More than 150 alleged militants were arrested by Nigerian police after clashes. The violence has pitted Islamic militants against government police and troops in the north-central part of the nation, officials said. Attacks continued Tuesday in the suburbs of the northern city of Maiduguri, said Shehu Sani, president of the Civil Rights Congress, a human rights organization based in northern Nigeria. People there are seeking refuge in police and military barracks and in hospitals, he said. Police and troops were dispatched to the militants' hideouts after they began attacks on government establishments Sunday, said police spokesman Moses Anegbode. As authorities exchanged fire with the militants, 41 people, including a soldier and a policeman, were killed, Anegbode said Monday. In addition, some 176 people were arrested in Bauchi, he said. Besides Bauchi, militants also staged attacks on the nearby states of Yobe and Borno on Sunday and Monday, said Emmanuel Ojukwu, spokesman for the national police. Yobe's police commissioner, Alhaji Muhammed Abbas, said that 23 suspected militants were arrested in connection with a bomb attack at a police station in Potiskum that killed a policeman and a civilian and wounded seven people. The official News Agency of Nigeria reported that as many as 100 members of a religious sect led by Sheikh Mohammed Yusuf may have been killed in a confrontation with police. In Borno, police spokesman Isa Azare said that two policemen were killed in an attack on police headquarters late Monday. ""The religious fanatics took the police unawares,"" Azare told the government-affiliated New Nigerian newspaper. ""That was why they succeeded in killing all the officers on night duty."" Panicked residents stayed inside in all three states, and businesses shut down, even though officials said the situation was under control. The militants used guns, bows and arrows and machetes in the attacks, officials said. The militants disagree with the government's teaching of Islam in the region, maintaining that the government allows itself to be influenced by Western values, and have been attacking government offices and Islamic clergy. There is a history of religious violence in central Nigeria, where majority-Muslim north Africa meets largely Christian sub-Saharan Africa. Human Rights Watch estimates that more than 1,000 people were killed in riots in 2001. The human rights organization alleged last week that police and soldiers killed at least 133 people during two days of riots between Muslims and Christians in Nigeria last year. Most of the victims were young Muslim men, often unarmed, the group charged in testimony before a state commission examining the riots and in a separate report. More than 700 people died in the violence, the organization said, citing local religious authorities on both sides of the divide. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","As many as 400 people killed in Nigerian violence, group says .

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- Steroid test results and notes and calendars from his then-trainer are among the evidence federal prosecutors have amassed in their perjury case against baseball home-run king Barry Bonds, according to documents unsealed Wednesday. Barry Bonds, shown at his most recent court appearance, is accused of lying to a grand jury. The 223-page stack of documents unsealed by a federal judge represents much of the government's case against Bonds, who is accused of obstructing justice and lying to a grand jury investigating the use of steroids in professional sports. Prosecutors say the test results show Bonds was using performance-enhancing substances -- including a then-undetectable designer drug -- at a time he denied knowingly using any. Bonds' attorneys are seeking to keep much of that evidence out of court. The 44-year-old former San Francisco Giants slugger holds Major League Baseball's single-season and all-time home-run titles, but his achievements have been shadowed by allegations he used performance-enhancing drugs. Bonds pleaded not guilty to the perjury and obstruction of justice charges and has been free on $500,000 bond. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Thursday. The charges stem from his 2003 appearance before a federal grand jury probing the distribution of steroids by the San Francisco-area Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative, or BALCO. Bonds told the grand jury that his former personal trainer, Greg Anderson, gave him a cream that he said was flaxseed oil to use on his arm in 2003. Anderson spent three months in prison after admitting distributing steroids and was later jailed for refusing to cooperate with prosecutors. The case against Bonds will include calendars kept by Anderson that prosecutors say were used to keep Bonds and other athletes on a doping regimen -- an assertion expected to be bolstered by the testimony of other athletes, they said. Evidence will include a recording of a phone conversation with an associate in which Anderson ""describes injecting the defendant, having the ability to obtain and utilize inside information about MLB's random drug testing to the defendant's benefit and the undetectable nature of what Anderson had been doing,"" according to documents. Bonds won seven National League MVP titles during his 22-year career, 15 years of which was spent with the Giants. The team released him after the 2007 season, just weeks after he broke Hank Aaron's career home-run record.","NEW: Bonds' attorneys are seeking to keep many of the documents out of court .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A bronze statue of Helen Keller was unveiled at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday as lawmakers praised her as a trailblazer and an inspiration for those with disabilities. The Helen Keller statue depicts the moment when Anne Sullivan spelled ""W-A-T-E-R"" into the child's hand . ""Some are still dismissed and cast aside for nothing more than being less than perfect,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said at the unveiling ceremony. ""The story of Helen Keller inspires us all."" The statue shows Keller -- who lost her sight and hearing to illness when she was 19 months old -- standing at a water pump as a 7-year-old, a look of recognition on her face as water streams into her hand. It depicts the moment in 1887 when teacher Anne Sullivan spelled ""W-A-T-E-R"" into one of the child's hands as she held the other under the pump. It's the moment when Keller realized meanings were hidden in the manual alphabet shapes Sullivan had taught her to make with her hands. ""W-A-T-E-R,"" said Alabama Gov. Bob Riley. ""Five simple letters that helped rescue 7-year-old Helen Keller from a world of darkness and a world of silence. ""It is this defining moment that we celebrate today. And in time, this moment so vividly depicted by this statue helped the world to understand that all of us, regardless of any disability, have a mind that can be educated, a hand that can be trained, a life that will have meaning."" Keller learned to speak and earned a degree from Radcliffe College and the women's branch of Harvard University. She traveled the world as an adult, wrote 12 books and championed causes including women's suffrage and workers' rights. Carl Augusto, president and CEO of the American Foundation for the Blind, told the crowd he thinks Keller, who worked for the foundation for the last 44 years of her life, ""would have loved this impressive statue of herself and the symbolism attached."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and others assisted Augusto as he ran his hands over the statue. The foundation, Augusto said, still considers Keller ""our guiding light. She embodies the American spirit of limitless possibility ... her biggest desire was to leave the world a better place than she found it, and ladies and gentlemen, that's the legacy she leaves all of us."" More than 40 of Keller's descendants attended the ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda. Students from the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind sang a medley of patriotic songs. The statue, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, will ""always remind us that people must be respected for what they can do rather than judged for what they cannot."" The statue is also the Capitol's first depicting a child, Riley's office said. Since 1864, each state has been allowed to place two statues in the Capitol. In 2002, Congress changed the law to allow states to change their statues. Riley, then a U.S. representative, suggested the state place a statue of Keller, and the state Legislature passed a resolution asking Congress to accept a statue of Keller as a gift. A committee with Alabama first lady Patsy Riley serving as honorary chairwoman raised private donations and selected Utah bronze sculpture artist Edward Hlavka to create the piece. The 600-pound statue is made of bronze with a base of Alabama marble, Riley's office said. In 1997, a Franklin Delano Roosevelt memorial that opened near the National Mall drew complaints from disability advocates because the statue of the president, who suffered from polio, did not show him in a wheelchair. In 2001, President Clinton unveiled an addition to the memorial including a new statue of the four-term president sitting in a wheelchair. ""By placing this statue in the Capitol, we appropriately honor this extraordinary American, and will inspire countless children who will come to understand that with faith and with courage, there truly are no limits on what can be accomplished, and there is no obstacle that can't be overcome,"" Riley said. Keller's statue will replace one depicting Jabez Curry. Curry, who has represented Alabama in the Capitol since 1908, was a Georgia native who served as president of Howard College, which later became Samford University in Birmingham. The Curry statue is being sent back to Alabama for display at the university. The other statue representing Alabama is of Joseph ""Fightin' Joe"" Wheeler, a Confederate general during the Civil War who, three decades later, volunteered to serve in the Spanish-American War at age 62 and attained the same rank in the U.S. Army, the only one of 425 Confederate generals to do so, according to a biography of him posted on the Fort Sam Houston Museum's Web site. His statue was donated by the state in 1925, Riley's office said.","Helen Keller lost her sight and hearing to illness when she was 19 months old .

"Washington (CNN) -- African-Americans are extremely supportive of President Obama, but their enthusiasm appears to have dramatically dropped from earlier this year, according to a new national poll. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey, released Tuesday, also indicates that Obama's presidency appears to have made blacks more optimistic about race relations, but less than one in five believe the new president has ushered in a new era of race relations in the country. More than nine in 10 blacks questioned in the poll approve of the job Obama's doing in the White House, far higher than 42 percent of whites who approve of his performance as president. But when asked how they personally feel about Obama's presidency, only 42 percent of black respondents say they're thrilled, with nearly half of those questioned saying they are happy but not thrilled. The 42 percent who are thrilled is down from 61 percent in January, when Obama was inaugurated. ""African-Americans are still big fans of the first black president in U.S. history, but the thrill is gone,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. According to the poll, 51 percent of African-Americans say Obama's presidency has brought some improvement in race relations in the U.S., but only 18 percent feel it's the start of a new era. Another 23 percent say they've seen a real change in race relations over the past 11 months and 7 percent say things have gotten worse. The survey indicates that three-quarters of blacks believe race relations will improve eventually, which is up from 49 percent of blacks who felt that way a year before Obama was elected. ""Whites take a dimmer view of Obama's effect on race relations, with a third believing that the new presidency has not changed race relations in the country and 15 percent of whites saying that Obama has made race relations worse,"" Holland added. ""Not surprisingly, whites are less supportive of Obama, although for a notable number of whites, their negative view of the president is due to the perception that he's not been liberal enough."" The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted December 16-20, with 1,160 adult Americans, including 259 African-Americans and 786 whites, questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points and plus or minus 6 percentage points for the African-Americans sample.

"(CNN) -- The wife of al Qaeda's second-in-command has purportedly issued a message urging women to raise their children to love holy war and defend Muslim lands. The message from Omaima Hassan Ahmad Mohammad Hassad, wife of Osama bin Laden advisor Ayman al-Zawahiri, said that since women could not fight, they should dedicate themselves to so-called holy warriors, or mujahedeen. ""I ask you to raise your children to obey Allah and love jihad [holy war] and to defend the Muslim lands,"" she said, in a message released by As-Sahab Media -- al Qaeda's production company. ""Fighting is not easy for women because they need a male guardian by their side. ... But we can place ourselves in service of the mujahedeen and do what they ask of us. We can help by supporting warriors with money or information or even by a martyrdom operation."" CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the document, which appeared on multiple radical Islamist Web sites. Hassan also asked that Allah grant her and her Muslim sisters ""patience and persistence until death,"" especially in the Palestinian Authority, and in Iraq, Chechnya, Afghanistan and Somalia. CNN's senior editor for Middle East affairs, Octavia Nasr, said it is not a usual practice for women linked to al Qaeda to release messages. ""It signals that al Qaeda seems to be aggressively reaching out to the female population, whereas in the past their focus was mainly on men,"" she said.","Omaima Hassan Ahmad Mohammad Hassad is wife of Ayman al-Zawahiri .

"Washington (CNN) -- Washington Wizards point guard Gilbert Arenas admits he drew guns in the team locker room in a highly publicized December 21 incident, but says he was only kidding around. ""I took the unloaded guns out in a misguided effort to play a joke on a teammate,"" Arenas said in a statement released Monday. ""Contrary to some press accounts, I never threatened or assaulted anyone with the guns and never pointed them at anyone. Joke or not, I now recognize that what I did was a mistake and was wrong."" Citing NBA sources last month, the New York Post reported that Arenas and Javaris Crittenton both brandished firearms in the team's locker room. Authorities continue to investigate the incident. Crittenton's agent, Mark Bartelstein, told CNN Monday that his client ""hasn't done anything wrong. I'm extremely confident he'll be exonerated."" Asked if Crittenton brought a gun into the Verizon Center that day, Bartelstein said, ""I'm not going to get into details."" He said Crittenton has not met with authorities, nor has such a meeting been requested or scheduled. Arenas, a three-time NBA All-Star, spent Monday afternoon in a voluntary meeting with federal prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington and with D.C. metropolitan police about the incident, according to his attorney, Kenneth L. Wainstein. ""From the outset of this incident, Mr. Arenas has been fully cooperative with the investigation,"" Wainstein said in a statement, noting that Arenas relinquished the guns to Wizards security officers and met with authorities to ""tell the full story."" ""Over the course of a two-hour interview this afternoon, Mr. Arenas answered every question asked of him,"" Wainstein said in Monday's statement. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment on Arenas' statement, citing the ongoing investigation. Arenas said he told authorities that he stored four unloaded guns in his locker the Verizon Center to keep them away from his children. Arenas said he told authorities that he stored four unloaded guns in his locker the Verizon Center to keep them away from his children. ""I brought them without any ammunition into the District of Columbia, mistakenly believing that the recent change in the DC gun laws allowed a person to store unloaded guns in the District,"" he said in the statement. He offered a public apology to the league, his teammates and his fans, saying, ""I promise to do better in the future."" NBA spokesman Tim Frank declined to comment on Arenas' comments, deferring to an earlier statement: ""There is an active investigation by DC law enforcement authorities, which we are monitoring closely. We are not taking any independent action at this time.""","New York Post: Washington Wizards teammates drew guns on each other .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel will bring a ""tough-minded"" and ""pragmatic"" approach to the White House when he becomes President-elect Barack Obama's chief of staff, according to people who know the Chicago, Illinois, native. Rep. Rahm Emanuel has experience in the White House, on Wall Street and on Capitol Hill. Emanuel, a former top aide to President Clinton, has accepted the position in the new administration, Obama confirmed in a statement Thursday. ""I announce this appointment first because the chief of staff is central to the ability of a president and administration to accomplish an agenda,"" Obama said. ""And no one I know is better at getting things done than Rahm Emanuel."" In the job, Emanuel would oversee the White House staff. The chief of staff is usually involved in all the major decisions that the president makes and is responsible for making sure the administration carries out the president's wishes.  Watch Emanuel call himself ""fortunate"" Â» . The chief of staff also often is involved in negotiations with congressional leaders when major legislation is under consideration. Jim Manley, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called Emanuel: ""An excellent choice."" ""Rahm knows the Hill. And he knows the White House. He is a brilliant strategic thinker and someone who knows how to get things done,"" Manley said. Manley also rejected the idea that Emanuel is a true partisan that could not work with Republicans. ""That's ridiculous. Rahm understands politics is the art of compromise. He's got a deeply held set of views but he also understands to get things done you have to compromise,"" he said. After leaving the Clinton White House, Emanuel, 48, was an investment banker on Wall Street and later was elected to the House of Representatives in 2002 from a heavily Democratic Chicago district. He quickly rose to become the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House.  Watch what Emanuel brings to the White House Â» . It is Emanuel's combination of experiences -- plus his strong personal relationship with Obama -- that would make him a strong chief of staff, said CNN political analyst Paul Begala, a fellow Clinton veteran. ""He has spent more time in the White House than President-elect Obama has. That matters a lot. It is a special place with its own rhythms,"" Begala said.  See who Obama may be considering for his Cabinet Â» . ""But, maybe most importantly, he's got the relationship. He has known Barack and Michelle Obama for a number of years."" Before reports emerged that he had accepted the position, Emanuel told WLS-TV in Chicago that he had to consider the possible impact on his family.  Watch how Obama is starting his transition Â» . ""I have a lot to weigh: the basis of public service, which I have given my life to, a career choice. And most importantly, what I want to do as a parent,"" Emanuel said in an interview that aired Wednesday. Emanuel added: ""This is not a professional choice. This is a personal choice about what my wife and I want to do for our family, as much as what to do with my career."" Emanuel's at-times blunt approach would ensure the White House runs smoothly for the new president, said Mack McLarty, Clinton's former chief of staff.  Watch as McLarty calls Emanuel an ""excellent choice"" Â» . ""Rahm is high energy. He's direct. He's a tough-minded pragmatist. So I think the years have been good to him in that regard,"" McLarty said. ""I think the high-energy directness will serve him well. ""Rahm, like a lot of us, made mistakes, but he quickly corrected them."" However, the lawmaker's direct style has ruffled a number of feathers in Washington, and Emanuel is known as one of the toughest partisan fighters on Capitol Hill. After reports that Emanuel had agreed to be Obama's chief of staff on Thursday, the top Republican in the House, Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio, questioned the president-elect's pick.  Election T-shirt: Obama inspires historic victory . ""This is an ironic choice for a president-elect who has promised to change Washington, make politics more civil and govern from the center,"" Boehner said. According to a 2006 profile of Emanuel in Fortune magazine, Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma warned his fellow Republicans of Emanuel's ferocity in a letter two years ago. ""He's dangerous,"" Cole told Fortune then. ""He has a closing intensity. When he's got a political kill in sight, he's absolutely relentless."" But David Gergen, a CNN senior political analyst who has worked in five administrations, said the contrasting styles between Obama and Emanuel could help the new president get things done in Washington. ""They are obviously setting up a good cop/bad cop routine in the White House. ... Barack Obama can be the good guy,"" Gergen said. iReport.com: Who should be in Obama's cabinet? Emanuel has made a career of being the tough guy. In the 2006 Fortune profile, Begala described Emanuel's aggressive style as a ""cross between a hemorrhoid and a toothache.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Billionaire oil man T. Boone Pickens is shelving plans to build the world's largest wind farm. T. Boone Pickens says the capital markets will not support his plans to build the world's largest wind farm. The chairman of BP Capital Management announced Tuesday that his plans for the Pampa Wind Project, designed to generate 4,000 megawatts of electricity using thousands of wind turbines, is on hold. ""I had hoped that Pampa would be the starting point, but transmission issues and the problem with the capital markets make that unfeasible at this point,"" Pickens told CNN's Ali Velshi. ""I expect to continue development of the Pampa project, but not at the pace that I originally expected."" The Pickens Plan was an attempt to wean the United States off foreign oil and switch to wind and natural gas. The project was to be set in four Texas Panhandle counties. Pickens said he faced hurdles in routing the power from Texas to a distribution system. His plans were also stymied by a plunge in natural gas prices and a tightening credit market. ""The capital markets have dealt us all a setback, and I'm less aggressive with the Panhandle project than I have been,"" Pickens said.  Watch Pickens respond to criticism that the U.S. can't shake it's oil addiction Â» . He said he was still committed to 667 wind turbines that he has already ordered and would find homes for them. The Texas billionaire pushed The Pickens Plan in television commercials and lobbying efforts that started last summer. Pickens had hoped to complete his $12 billion plan in 2014 and provide enough electricity to power 1.3 million homes. Renewable energy is the source of only a small portion of electricity used today, but in 2008, the United States became the world's leading provider of wind power. Pickens, 81, made his fortune in oil production and trading and is listed in Forbes magazine as the 117th richest person in the United States with a net worth of about $3 billion in 2007.","T.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian forces that seized an Iraqi oil well have withdrawn from the installation but remain on Iraqi territory, a top Iraqi official charged Sunday. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government deployed more troops to Maysan province where oil well number 4 is located, Iraqi security officials said. They said workers returned to the well Sunday morning, escorted by the Iraqi army. Negotiations to resolve the diplomatic standoff are ongoing, said Iraq's Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abawi. Iran, however, dismissed Iraq's allegations of the takeover. ""Our forces are on our own soil and, based on the known international borders, this well belongs to Iran,"" the armed forces command said on the Web site of Iran's state-run Arabic-language Al-Alam TV. The Iraqi government had issued a strong statement deploring the act after al-Maliki attended an emergency meeting of Iraq's National Security Council to discuss the situation. Iraq demanded the Iranians withdraw remove an Iranian flag hoisted from the well tower in the takeover on Thursday night. Senior Iraqi government sources initially referred to the Iranians as security forces, but the official Iraqi government statement later called them an armed group. Alaeddin Borujerdi, head of the Iranian parliament's national security and foreign policy commission, also rejected Iraqi allegations, blaming the international media for distributing propaganda intended to harm relations between Iran and Iraq. Drilled in 1979, the well near the city of Amara is within the province's Fakka oil field, which includes a number of wells, the Iraqi government said. The diplomatic scuffle, a manifestation of existing tension between the two neighbors, prompted discussions between Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki and his Iraqi counterpart Hoshyar Zebari on Saturday, Iran's state-run Press TV reported. Iraq and Iran share a long border, and high-ranking committees from both countries handle all border matters, an Iranian Embassy official said. Political, economic, cultural and religious ties between Iran and Iraq, which are both majority Shiite Muslim nations, greatly improved after the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003. At the same time, there has been widespread concern among Iraqi and U.S. officials that Iran has been providing Iraqi insurgents with material for roadside bombs during the Iraq war. And Iraq and Iran fought a bloody eight-year war that ended in 1988 in a cease-fire with no clear victor and parts of the border under dispute. The report of the oil-well incident comes just after the oil ministry's two-day auction of oil fields. Aimed at increasing Iraqi oil production, deals were struck for seven of the 15 fields offered. Iraq, however, was forced to halt its exports from northern oil fields due to an attack -- the fourth in two months -- on a main pipeline Saturday about 300 kilometers (186 miles) north of Baghdad, Oil Ministry spokesman Assim Jihad said.","Iranian forces that seized Iraqi oil well withdraw from facility but remain in Iraq, says Iraqi official .

"(CNN) -- Benjamin Wallen, self-proclaimed biggest fan of HBO's ""The Wire,"" thought it was well worth a $300 flight home to watch the highly anticipated series finale of the acclaimed crime drama with his best friends -- and fellow series diehards -- Sunday night. The finale of ""The Wire"" has raised intense interest -- all the more so because it's not available on demand. Though the season finale is not scheduled to air nationally until Sunday, HBO has made episodes of the series available through certain cable providers' on-demand feature up to a week before their national air dates. But when Wallen and his friends huddled around the television and switched on the cable box at 12:03 a.m. Monday, their hearts sank: The new episode wasn't listed. They tried an old trick, turning the cable box power switch on and off, hoping the episode would eventually appear. Finally, something did show up -- but not the finale. In the place where the show should have been, Wallen, 24, and his friends found a one-minute preview of the finale that ended simply with a title screen bearing the date ""March 10,"" the day the show will be available on demand. Like thousands of other ""Wire"" fanatics who had similarly flocked to the presumed early screener Sunday night, the group sat stunned. ""It completely killed the whole weekend,"" Wallen said. ""We are diehard fans who have watched it every week -- a week early. We didn't think this week would be any different."" The finale of ""The Wire"" has earned intense interest from fans who have followed the Baltimore-set show zealously since its premiere in 2002. The critically lauded show has never matched the audience of other HBO programs, such as ""The Sopranos,"" but its viewers are a particularly passionate lot, following the show's motley crew of cops, drug dealers, struggling children, politicians and journalists with deeply probing blogs and running commentary.  Gallery: Get to know the characters of ""The Wire"" Â» . They want to delve deeper into the show's portrayal of what creator David Simon has described as ""what it feels like to live in the American city."" Monday morning, the official HBO Web site confirmed that the series finale would not be made available early, but would premiere during its regularly scheduled 9 p.m. Sunday time slot. While the decision to not release the show early was a surprise to fans, it was one made back at the beginning of the final season at the urging of Simon, executives at HBO said. HBO vice president Dave Baldwin said that in seasons past, spoilers about season finales and the episodes themselves had leaked onto the Web, so Simon requested a change in the schedule. Baldwin acknowledged that there were many angry fans -- some of whom are calling HBO liars -- but attributed their rancor to their passion for the show. But what could he say? ""Forgive us, we thought we were doing the right thing,"" Baldwin said. ""And anything else that a husband would say to his wife [in] begging for forgiveness."" The curtain of secrecy around ""The Wire"" finale is one Simon intends to keep tightly drawn until the show begins Sunday night. Aaron Barnhart, TV critic for The Kansas City Star, found out just how tightly guarded Simon intended to keep it when he posted an entry to his blog about the advance copy of the finale he received. Barnhart told CNN he intended not to spoil the show for fans, only discussing small details of the finale. But what Barnhart thought was a small detail -- the finale's closing song -- turned out to be otherwise for Simon. Less than three hours after the blog entry was posted, Barnhart received a voice mail from someone identifying himself as Simon, imploring him to take the post down, because there is a great deal of anticipation and betting on what the song will be. Barnhart said he had no idea the closing segment was such a big deal, saying it hadn't made a big impact on him in the past, but he realized that doesn't mean it isn't a huge deal to other fans. ""I think it is a token of the strong bond that this show has to its small niche of fans,"" he said. ""[Simon] wants to reward the devotion of those fans with a moment like that. He's decided it's important, and the fact that it's not important to me doesn't entitle me to spoil it."" While some ""Wire"" fans who were duped out of an early release ranted on HBO message boards, Facebook and MySpace, Wallen said he and his friends decided to find the positive in it all. ""I guess the consolation is that we have five extra days to be excited and talk about the show before it's over,"" he said. HBO is a division of Time Warner, as is CNN.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday admitted he made a mistake in handling the nomination of Tom Daschle as his health and human services secretary, saying Daschle's tax problems sent a message that the politically powerful are treated differently from average people. President Barack Obama is interviewed by CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday. Daschle, the former Democratic leader in the U.S. Senate, withdrew earlier Tuesday as news that he failed to pay some taxes in the past continued to stir opposition on Capitol Hill. ""I think I screwed up,"" Obama said in a wide-ranging interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""And I take responsibility for it and we're going to make sure we fix it so it doesn't happen again."" Daschle had apologized Monday for what he said were honest mistakes, calling them an embarrassment. The series of errors included improperly reporting $15,000 in charitable donations, failing to list $80,000 in lobbying income due to what Daschle said was a paperwork error, and not reporting as income a car and driver loaned to him by a friend and business associate.  Watch Obama admit mistake Â» . Daschle recently filed amended tax returns and paid more than $140,000 in back taxes and interest for 2005 to 2007. Those tax issues, as well as questions over whether work he did after his stint in the Senate amounted to lobbying, gave critics ammunition to question Obama's call for a change of culture in Washington. ""Ultimately, I campaigned on changing Washington and bottom-up politics,"" Obama said. ""And I don't want to send a message to the American people that there are two sets of standards -- one for powerful people and one for ordinary folks who are working every day and paying their taxes.""  Watch the full interview with Anderson Cooper Â» . Obama defended Daschle's original appointment, saying ""nobody was better-equipped to deal both with the substance and policy of health care."" ""He understands it as well as anybody, but also the politics, which is going to be required to actually get it done,"" Obama said. Earlier, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs insisted Daschle's decision to withdraw was made on his own, not as a result of any prodding from the administration. In a written statement, Daschle acknowledged the political problem he had created for the administration. Still, Obama insisted the mistake was his.  Read how CNN analysts assess the situation Â» . Obama also said he's going to crack down on businesses using taxpayer money to excessively pay executives. He plans a Wednesday announcement of mechanisms to keep that from happening. ""I'm going to be talking about executive compensation and changes we're going to be making there,"" he said. ""We've now learned that people are still getting huge bonuses despite the fact that they're getting taxpayer money, which I think infuriates the public.""  Watch Obama discuss getting tough on executives Â» . The president also spoke about the struggling economy, the use of the label ""war on terror,"" and lighter topics, including the family dog and his efforts to stop smoking. Thinking about the nation's faltering economy keeps him up at night, Obama said. He also addressed criticism that there is too much spending in the current stimulus package bill written by House Democrats. iReport.com: Was Daschle properly vetted? ""Look, the only measure of my success as president when people look back five years from now or nine years from now is going to be, did I get this economy fixed. I have no interest in promoting a package that doesn't work,"" Obama said. Cooper also asked Obama about reports that he is not using former President Bush's phrase, ""war on terror,"" to refer to the wars in Iraq in Afghanistan. ""Words matter in this situation because one of the ways we're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds,"" Obama said. ""I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations, but that those organizations aren't representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community.""  Watch Obama talk about the phrase ""war on terror"" Â» . Moving on to lighter topics, the president said the first family hasn't decided what type of dog to get, but will wait until spring. Obama, an intermittent smoker, also said he has not smoked on the White House grounds. ""Sometimes it's hard. But, you know, I'm sticking to it,"" Obama said. iReport.com: 'People should give him some slack' Asked about the greatest lesson he'd learned about the presidency from studying about Abraham Lincoln, Obama said: . ""You know, when I think about Abraham Lincoln, what I'm struck by is the fact that he constantly learned on the job. He got better. You know, he wasn't defensive. He wasn't arrogant about his tasks.

"(Sunset) -- An insider shares five top experiences in Sausalito, California, you won't read about in guidebooks. Waldo Point Harbor is one of several scenic houseboat communities in Sausalito. Off-the-path pier . You'll want a bike or a car to get to the Fort Baker fishing pier, which sits in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge and has unbeatable views across the bay to San Francisco. In summer, foghorns bellow loudly from here, but in December, fishermen and pelicans are more the order of the day. A short walk north is eco-luxe Cavallo Point: The Lodge at the Golden Gate, which was big news in town when it debuted last summer. Even if you don't stay there, stop for a glass of wine in the clubby Farley Bar. Locals' beach . Schoonmaker Beach is a bit farther from downtown, but still doable on foot and well worth finding. My son and I have whiled away many sunny mornings here, wading in the bay and watching sailboats. The beach bumped up to our number one favorite in April with the addition of Le Garage, a French bistro steps from the sand and, hands down, the best new restaurant in town in ages. Grab a seat next to the roll-up glass garage door and definitely try the mussels ProvenÃ§ale. Sunset.com: 20 perfect summer trips . Undiscovered hike . You can't spend time in Sausalito and not make it to the Marin Headlands, just a mile outside town -- it'd be like going to Yosemite and missing Half Dome. So join the parade of cars winding up twisty Conzelman Road to Hawk Hill, but don't stop there. Drive a bit farther to the beach parking area on your left, and you'll see signs for the trail to Black Sands Beach. The 0.75-mile hike down (slightly rickety) steps is sure to put the rosy in your cheeks, and the narrow strip of beach is windy, wild and stunning. My secret? Instead of starting from the beach parking area, I like to drive past the Marin Headlands Visitor Center, turn right on Bunker Road, and start at the historic rifle range. It's worth the extra 1.5 miles over the ridge for the views you'll have all to yourself. Sunset.com: Our amazing national parks . Best shopping street . There's more to Sausalito shopping than the chintzy souvenir shops that line the main drag downtown. Just a 10-minute walk north of the waterfront lies leafy Caledonia Street, home to several locally owned galleries and framing shops, plus Flying Oliver Books, where we always find deals on used cookbooks. I love to look at the black-and-white photography at Sausalito Picture Framing and pick up letterpress holiday cards and fashionable ribbons and papers for present wrapping at Pinestreet Papery. And one block to the east on Bridgeway is McCloud Design, with streamlined modern container gardens, handcrafted fountains and outdoor furniture. Sunset.com: Outdoor dining rooms . Hidden harbor . Sausalito wouldn't be Sausalito without its houseboats. Among several houseboat communities in town, Waldo Point Harbor stands out for its hilarious, only-in-Sausalito message board at the harbor entrance. On my all-star list: ""Lost: Plywood dinghy, battered blue"" (alongside a charmingly rakish drawing of the poor lost boat) and ""Want to exchange your houseboat with mine in Paris for a week?"" Impressive feats of container gardening -- succulents, roses, lemon trees -- line the boardwalk, and residents are often out watering plants in the early morning. Truth be told, I did once catch a minibus of Japanese tourists being let off in this area, but that was in the height of summer, and they seemed to walk right past Issaquah Dock, our favorite spot.

"Editor's Note: The following story contains spoilers regarding the show ""House."" If you'd rather not know what happens, stop reading now. Kal Penn, left, with Peter Jacobson on ""House,"" is joining the Obama White House. LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- When Dr. Lawrence Kutner killed himself on the latest episode of ""House: MD,"" it was the beginning of a new career for actor Kal Penn. The demise of Penn's character cleared the way for the actor to move on to another ""House,"" the White House. Penn, 31, will be an associate director for the Obama administration's Office of Public Liaison. ""It seemed like something I would enjoy doing,"" Penn said. ""I figured it was something to do."" He's not retiring from acting, just pursuing a longtime desire for public service that was rekindled when he campaigned for Barack Obama's election, Penn said. Penn played a teen terrorist on Fox's ""24"" before joining the network's ""House"" two years ago. He's also known as Kumar Patel in the ""Harold & Kumar"" movie series. The White House job likely ends his Kumar roles, he said. In fact, he will not consider any acting jobs until he leaves the Obama administration, he said. Penn will take a big pay cut to work for the government, but he has committed to at least one or two years in the job, he said. His focus will be as a liaison for the arts community and the Asian-American community, he said. He filled a similar role in the Obama presidential campaign, he said. ""We want to make sure that everyone's concerns are heard and they are familiar with the president's plans and proposals,"" he said. Penn said he spoke briefly with Obama after the election about ""trying to find the right fit"" for him in the administration. He said he has bittersweet emotions as he leaves Hollywood to search for an apartment in Washington next week. The writers' decision to have Dr. Kutner commit suicide ensures Penn will not return to the show, although he said he leaves on good terms. He felt ""more than a little bit of shock and loss"" to learn that his character would die in his final episode. Even though he spoke no lines in the episode -- and only his legs are seen when his body is found -- he was on the set for the filming, he said.

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- A Spanish court convicted 11 Islamic militants Monday of membership in a terrorist group, but acquitted them of a ""specific"" conspiracy to carry out an attack on Barcelona's metro subway system, as prosecutors alleged. The court instead said there was a more general decision by the group, linked to al Qaeda, to use explosives against Barcelona's metro, but that a specific date and place had not been determined, nor had a sufficient amount of explosives been assembled, according to a copy of the sentence viewed by CNN. The judges ruled the alleged Barcelona plot had ""not advanced sufficiently"" to constitute a crime of conspiracy under Spanish law. The alleged plot in January 2008 had raised alarm bells in Europe because Spanish authorities said there were to be a series of attacks, starting with suicide bombings on the Barcelona metro, and then other attacks in Spain, Germany, France, Portugal and Great Britain, if successive demands from a Pakistani Taliban leader and al Qaeda were not met. The trial against 10 Pakistani men and an Indian national was held last month. All proclaimed their innocence and many refused to answer prosecutors questions. The three-judge panel at the National Court ruled on Monday that all 11 belonged to a terrorist group. Two of the 11 also were convicted of possession of explosives, but nine others were acquitted on that charge. The 11 face prison terms of eight to 14 years. But Jose Maria Fuster-Fabra, a private prosecutor representing victims in the case, told CNN the sentence sets a precedent in Spain because the 11 defendants were convicted for terrorist group membership almost solely on the basis of a key police informant, known as F1 to protect his identity. F1 testified he was selected by the group's leader to be a suicide bomber, and that he quickly made a secretive call from a bathroom at a Barcelona mosque to warn a friend in France about an impending terrorist attack. Hours later, police swooped to make arrests in January 2008 in Barcelona. The protected witness denied on the stand that he worked for French or any other secret service. Defense lawyer Jacobo Teijelo, on the team representing all 11 defendants, said the sentence lacked judicial merit and he vowed to appeal to Spain's Supreme Court. About 30 members of Barcelona's large Pakistani community watched the trial almost daily in a bulletproof basement courtroom at the high-security National Court in central Madrid. A community leader told CNN the defendants were innocent and that the Pakistani community in Barcelona was hardworking and law-abiding. More than 300 suspected Islamic extremists have been arrested in Spain since the Madrid commuter train bombings that killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800 on March 11, 2004, Spain's interior minister has said.","Court convicts 11 Islamic militants of belonging to terrorist group, but acquits them of conspiring to attack Barcelona's metro .

"PITTSBURGH, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- For Pittsburgh International Airport, the Group of 20 summit is like the Sunday after Thanksgiving: the busiest flying day of the year, with world leaders instead of holiday travelers. Officials greet Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal, left, on Wednesday at Pittsburgh International Airport. After weeks of logistics and planning, the airport and the adjacent Air Force Reserve Base will see 23 heads of state arrive in the space of a few hours. President Obama is hosting the G-20 summit -- a two-day meeting of representatives of the world's largest economies -- Thursday and Friday in Pittsburgh. ""This is unprecedented,"" Allegheny County Chief Executive Dan Onorato said. ""We've never seen anything like it."" The county runs the airport and coordinated the arrivals along with the White House, U.S. State Department and law enforcement officials. The arrivals will take place away from the commercial passenger terminals on the huge airport property. With different areas being used, some of the presidents and prime ministers will show up at the same time.  Watch Pittsburgh's security preparations for protesters Â» . ""It is all scheduled. No one will be sitting out"" on the tarmac waiting, Onorato said. There are no welcoming ceremonies planned at the airport. The leaders quickly will get into separate motorcades and be whisked to downtown Pittsburgh. A formal greeting will take place Thursday evening at a conservatory in Pittsburgh's Oakland neighborhood. The heads of state invited to Pittsburgh include the leader of the European Union and the prime ministers of the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. Many leaders are bringing hundreds of delegates and support staff with them as well. At least two countries are bringing jumbo jets into the airport. Members of Saudi Arabia's delegation landed Wednesday evening. The leaders are arriving from New York, where they attended the U.N. General Assembly. Airport officials say the VIP landings will not mean delays for passengers, though they warn trips to and from the airport could take extra time because of road closings for motorcades. It's Obama's second trip to Pittsburgh in nine days. He addressed the AFL-CIO Convention on September 15 at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, where the G-20 summit also is being held. This time, Air Force One will have plenty of company.","Representatives of world's largest economies meeting for two days in Pittsburgh .

"(CNN)  -- Being the leader and second-richest person in one of the most beautiful and cultured nations on Earth might sound cushy, but Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is having a rough year. Already the subject of intense criticism over his personal life and management style, Berlusconi took another blow Sunday when a man police are calling ""mentally unstable"" smacked the Italian prime minister in the face with a souvenir replica of a cathedral. Berlusconi, 73, who was in his hometown of Milan stumping for a political ally, suffered broken teeth and a fractured nose. His alleged assailant, Massimo Tartaglia, is being held by Milanese authorities, who believe he acted alone. As he has done in the past after nonphysical attacks, Berlusconi blamed political opponents. ""What I can tell you is that there has been such a buildup of hatred toward the premier, and this is not good,"" Berlusconi spokesman Paolo Buonaiuti said. ""This campaign of hatred has been building quite rapidly recently, and I am not surprised that what happened tonight took place."" The prime minister scores highly in polls gauging Italian popular opinion, though he has been tried on various charges 17 times since taking office in 1994. The charges include corruption, false accounting and tax fraud. Berlusconi has said he did nothing wrong and accused magistrates of conducting a witch hunt. He also noted that he has never been convicted. In some cases, he was found guilty but won on appeal. Berlusconi was elected to his third term as premier in April 2008, about two months after his trial on corruption charges was postponed until after the election. His ability to maneuver through political crises has prompted a prominent journalist to liken him to a puppeteer, saying he is popular because he's a skilled populist. Berlusconi is ""a man who pulls the most elementary strings of the public opinion -- a public opinion, which in Italy in these times, prefers simple paths,"" said Giulio Anselmi, chairman of ANSA, Italy's leading news wire. Even by Berlusconi's standards, 2009 has been a tumultuous year, as his second wife has filed for divorce and allegations of corruption and infidelity continue to surface. This month's Rolling Stone Italy cheekily declared him ""Rock Star of the Year."" Editor Carlo Antonelli released a statement saying the prime minister made rockers Keith Richards and Rod Stewart look like ""schoolboys."" ""This year the choice was unanimous for his obvious merits due to a lifestyle for which the words, rock 'n' roll, fall short,"" Antonelli's statement said. Watch how Berlusconi was hit at a rally . The prime minister's second wife, Veronica Lario, whom he married in 1990, filed for divorce in May after news reports that he attended a birthday party for 18-year-old Neapolitan model Noemi Letizia, with whom he was accused of having an improper relationship. Berlusconi called the allegations ""slander"" and the girl's family, longtime friends of the prime minister, also deny there was anything improper. Lario, the mother of three of Berlusconi's five children, is asking for about $70 million a year from the prime minister, whom Forbes magazine ranked this year as No. 70 on its list of richest people, with an estimated net worth of $6.5 billion. More allegations followed the divorce filing, including claims that women were paid to attend parties at the prime minister's various homes. Berlusconi denied those allegations, telling the Italian magazine ""Chi"" he would never pay for sex because it would dampen the ""the pleasure of the conquest."" In June, he went to court to block the publication of hundreds of photos from his seaside villa in Sardinia, saying they posed ""an aggressive intrusion into my private life."" A Spanish paper ran some of the photos, showing scantily clad women at Berlusconi's villa and reporting that the premier was the subject of an investigation into whether he used official Italian aircraft to ferry guests to his villa. Berlusconi admitted using government airplanes to ferry guests, but an investigation found no wrongdoing on the premier's part. In October, old allegations of political scandal re-emerged when Italy's Constitutional Court overturned a law that shielded presidents, prime ministers and the leaders of both houses of parliament from prosecution. The court said the constitution requires all Italians to be equal before the law. Berlusconi had pushed for the immunity law after his 2008 re-election, and the court's action opened Berlusconi to prosecution on allegations that he paid British tax attorney David Mills $600,000 to provide false testimony in two court cases in the 1990s. Mills was convicted, but is appealing. The Constitutional Court's ruling also lifted Berlusconi's immunity from prosecution on charges that his company, Mediaset, failed to pay $45 million in taxes between 2000 and 2003. The latter case was postponed until January because the prime minister was unable to attend hearings, but Berlusconi has been outspoken in his defense against all of the allegations. He said he believes he is on trial for political reasons and has called magistrates ""communist bullies."" He also has declared himself the most persecuted man ""in the entire history of the world."" The Italian leader has often blamed Italy's ills on the left wing. He doesn't enjoy leading the country, he said, ""because very often there is a lot of dirty dealing."" He leads out of a sense of sacrifice and duty and because he is the ""only leader able to hold the center-right together,"" he has told CNN. But Berlusconi seems aware that his popularity and populism allow him to continue to hold sway in this nation of about 58 million. Though his popularity recently has seen a slight dip among women, he routinely garners approval ratings of 50 percent or higher. ""When I go around, it's embarrassing to see the affection showered upon me,"" Berlusconi told CNN in October. ""I know that people can change their opinions ... but I must say that I just note the fact that I am close to the heart of many Italians and they show this to me very often.""","Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi has blamed political opponents for physical, nonphysical attacks .

"(CNN)  -- Tenants of apartments in Pacifica, California, were under evacuation Thursday after erosion  threatened the cliff on which their building sits, a city official said. Authorities have been watching the seaside building for years and were waiting for the erosion to reach a 12-foot safety zone behind it, said Doug Rider, a building official for Pacifica. The problem has reached that zone, he said, so officials notified the building's management and tenants began evacuating. The building is stable, so tenants are able to remove belongings from the apartments, Rider said. Police, fire and other local authorities are assisting residents, along with the city's Building Department, he said. All residents of the 12-unit building must be out by 5 p.m. PT Thursday, he told CNN affiliate KGO-TV in San Francisco, California. KGO reported a large chunk of land fell from the cliff into the Pacific Ocean about 5:30 a.m. PT Thursday. Two nearby buildings also face questions about their structural reliability but are not being evacuated, the station reported. Pacifica is about 15 miles southwest of San Francisco. CNN's Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","Residents of 12-unit building must be out by Thursday afternoon, CNN affiliate reports .

"(CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama's transition team announced several key appointments to his communications team Saturday. Robert Gibbs will have one of the most highly visible roles in the Obama administration. Robert Gibbs, an Obama campaign spokesman who also has acted as spokesman for the transition, will become Obama's press secretary, one of the most highly visible roles in the administration. Gibbs, an Auburn, Alabama, native who has worked for Sen. Fritz Hollings, the Democratic Senatorial Committee and Sen. John Kerry's presidential campaign, was communications director and then a senior strategist for the Obama campaign. Ellen Moran, executive director of EMILY's List, will serve as Obama's communications director. Moran worked for the AFL-CIO, coordinating ""Wal-Mart corporate accountability activities,"" before returning to EMILY's, an organization dedicated to helping Democratic women get elected to office. It had endorsed Sen. Hillary Clinton for president.  See who's on Obama's short list for cabinet posts Â» . Dan Pfeiffer, current communications director with the transition team, will be Obama's deputy communications director. He began work with the Obama campaign in January 2007 as traveling press secretary before returning to Chicago, Illinois, to work as communications director. Unlike Gibbs and Pfeiffer, Moran is not already on Obama's communications team. ""These individuals will fill essential roles, and bring a breadth and depth of experience that can help our administration advance prosperity and security for the American people,"" Obama said in a written statement. ""This dedicated and impressive group of public servants includes longtime advisors and a talented new addition to our team, and together we will work to serve our country and meet the challenges of this defining moment in history."" On Friday, sources indicated that some of Obama's Cabinet posts were close to being filled. Two sources close to the transition team said New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner is ""on track"" to be offered the Treasury secretary post.  Watch CNN's Anderson Cooper discuss Obama's choices Â» . Transition officials told The Associated Press on Saturday that Obama planned to announce Geithner's appointment on Monday, along with that of Lawrence Summers as director of the National Economic Council. Summers is a former president of Harvard University and served as treasury secretary under Bill Clinton. Two sources said Friday that Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico is a serious contender for commerce secretary but that he could be chosen for another senior post. Geithner has played a large role in the government's efforts to wrangle the credit crisis, which has damaged markets and economies worldwide. Although a number of those efforts have been controversial, Geithner remains a well-regarded figure from Wall Street to Washington. Geithner began working with the Treasury Department in 1988 in the International Affairs division. In 1999, he became under-secretary of the Treasury for international affairs. Geithner would be charged with restoring stability to the financial markets, the banking system and the housing sector through oversight of the controversial $700 billion financial rescue package, of which about half is still available for use at the discretion of the Treasury secretary.  Watch CNN's John King discuss the posts with panelists Â» . The Dow Jones industrial index staged a late rally Friday after traders heard news of Geithner's possible appointment, rising by almost 500 points shortly before the market's closing time. The two sources close to the transition team said they do not consider Richardson's appointment to the Commerce Department to be a done deal. Richardson, 61, was a candidate for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. Currently in his second term as New Mexico's governor, he served as ambassador to the United Nations and energy secretary in the Clinton administration. Richardson is also considered to be a possibility for the secretary of state post. Also Friday, Sen. Hillary Clinton's camp shot down reports that she had agreed to accept the secretary of state position. ""We're still in discussions, which are very much on track,"" said Philippe Reines, Clinton's senior adviser. ""Any reports beyond that are premature."" The New York Times reported that Clinton would give up her Senate seat and accept the Cabinet post, citing two confidants, who said the decision was made after further consultation with Obama about the nature of her role and his foreign policy plans. A senior Obama aide told CNN there has been no development on a possible Clinton appointment since they informed CNN Thursday that she is ""on track"" to be nominated for secretary of state. Obama's transition team also appears close to choosing a national security adviser to the White House. Retired Marine Gen. Jim Jones has emerged as the president-elect's leading choice for the position, two sources close to the Obama transition team say. The sources said Jones has been given the impression by Obama that the job is his if he wants it. But the officials said that private discussions are under way and that no final decision has been made. The discussions are focused on precisely how much power Jones will have in the staff job, since he is used to being in a command role. Among his many posts, Jones served for several years as the operational commander for NATO.","NEW: Timothy Geithner to be announced as Treasury pick, AP reports .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Every year, I take at least one vacation out of the country to get my international travel fix. And this time, I'm taking you with me. The travel bug is a forever-itch that leaves you longing to wake up in a foreign country, Jarrett Bellini says. No, not literally. Sit down. This year, YOU can weigh in on where I go and what I do once I get there. We're calling it: Let's Ruin Jarrett's Vacation! By adding your comments below or sharing your ideas on CNN.com Live's Facebook page, you can send me to either Argentina, Greece, South Africa or Turkey. The destination that gets the most positive response is where I'll go. And to make it more fun, I won't even find out where I'm heading until I actually get to the airport this Sunday, August 30. There, I will tear open an envelope, read the results for the first time, and then head to my departure gate -- hopefully with at least a few articles of appropriate clothing. Once I get to wherever it is you send me, I'll be blogging on CNN.com and and checking in from time to time on CNN.com Live. By sharing your ideas on Facebook, you'll be able to guide many aspects of this vacation. You call the shots. And I'll cry myself to sleep at night wondering why I agreed to work on vacation and let other people plan it. I suppose, now, you might want a little background on why I'd actually want to do this. I mean, besides the fact that clearly, I'm a glutton for punishment. Really, though, I think I just like a challenge. In the fall of 2003, after an entire month of fruitlessly waiting by my phone to hear back about an entry-level position with CNN, I finally gave up hope and took my apparent job snub as some sort of cosmic sign from the Slacker Gods. I decided, then, that the only reasonable course of action was to buy a plane ticket to Europe to spend the next three months running around with my backpack, trying -- again, quite fruitlessly -- to meet foreign chicks. Though not quite a rucksack Casanova, I did come back from these magical three months with a far greater ability to entertain myself in a completely new place among absolute strangers. (Granted, for me, this can be accomplished by the presence of shiny objects.) Amazingly, the day after I returned from Europe, CNN called and offered me the position. It took four long months, but the timing was remarkable and I couldn't have been happier. But, as I started my new professional life, I was sick. I had the travel bug. Now, this is not to be confused with bed bugs, which, FYI, I painfully fell victim to in Copenhagen at a horrible, bomb-shelter-of-a-hostel they call Sleep in Heaven. Apparently, Heaven smells like mildew and leaves you with a rash. No, this was the travel bug -- the forever-itch that leaves you longing to wake up in a foreign bed in a foreign country, rising to face new ideas and new people beneath an unfamiliar sky. Of course, that's just my poorly poetic way of saying: The world is huge and amazing. It's so good! Once it hits your lips, it's so good!","Jarrett Bellini offers readers opportunity to decide where he's going on vacation .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Senate confirmed by unanimous consent retired Adm. Dennis Blair as director of national intelligence Wednesday. Retired Adm. Dennis Blair answers questions at his confirmation hearing last week. The confirmation followed the resignation of former director Michael McConnell, who left the post Tuesday after nearly two years on the job. Earlier this month, President Barack Obama nominated Blair to be chief of intelligence. McConnell had been expected to remain as DNI until Blair was in place, but a delay in Blair's confirmation prompted him to announce his resignation sooner than that. Blair's confirmation hearing was held last week. The retired admiral will continue to advise Obama, however, having agreed to serve on the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. The defense consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton announced Tuesday that McConnell will return to the company as a vice president. He left the firm in February 2007 to become the nation's second director of national intelligence. In a farewell letter obtained by CNN, McConnell thanked his colleagues for their hard work and touted some of the accomplishments during his tenure. At the top of his list: passage of legislation revising the law governing intelligence community eavesdropping and updating the presidential order that outlines the power and authorities of the community. ""These documents lay a foundation to provide the IC the structure and the tools needed to continue our work, while expanding privacy and civil liberties protections to all Americans,"" wrote McConnell. The office was created in late 2004 as part of the effort to improve intelligence gathering after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States and the faulty intelligence on Iraq weapons of mass destruction.","Retired Adm.

"(CNN) -- The search for two missing hikers on Oregon's Mount Hood has moved from a search operation into a recovery operation, authorities said Wednesday. ""It was our hope that we might get a window today to take a last look,"" Clackamas County, Oregon, Sheriff Craig Roberts told reporters. ""Unfortunately, that hasn't happened."" Anthony Vietti, 24; Luke Gullberg, 26; and Katie Nolan, 29, set out about 1 a.m. Friday on what was to have been a fairly easy ""semi-technical"" hike in which they would have descended the south side of the mountain, Sheriff's Deputy Scott Meyers has said. Gullberg was found dead Saturday from hypothermia. Authorities said Tuesday they were suspending the search, citing the threat of avalanches. Roberts said Wednesday the mountain was experiencing 60 mph winds and the weather is not expected to clear anytime soon. However, the Sheriff's Office will continue to monitor weather conditions and will launch an organized recovery mission when conditions improve, he said. ""God has given me a peace about Katie,"" Nolan's father, David Nolan, told reporters Wednesday. ""He's given me strength."" ""I think there needs to be a time of meeting with my family, and we're going to talk, and we're going to cry, and we're going to hug one another, and then we're going to turn around and praise God that we know Katie is in heaven,"" he said. ""We are confident ... she has led a life that's been exemplary."" ""This has not shaken our faith,"" said John Vietti, Anthony Vietti's father. ""This has strengthened our faith."" On Tuesday, authorities said there was little hope the two would be found alive. ""Could they be alive? Yes,"" said Dr. Terri Schmidt, physician supervisor for American Medical Response in Clackamas County. ""Is it very likely? No."" A specialist in emergency medicine, Schmidt noted that ""at about 48 hours -- two days -- the chances of finding somebody alive after that go down to about 1 percent."" Operations coordinator Nate Thompson hypothesized that the hikers may have been involved in an accident and that Gullberg, the most experienced of the three, may have broken away from the others and begun to backtrack in an effort to seek help. Above his body rescuers found a water bottle, a helmet, a harness, a camera and camera case and a mitten belonging to Nolan. ""Maybe Katie lost a mitten in an accident,"" Thompson said. If Gullberg did indeed seek to return for help and Nolan lost one of her mittens in an accident, he may have left his gear, his pack and his supplies and gloves with her, taking the lone mitten, he said. But descending can be more difficult than climbing in some places. ""If there was some form of an accident and Luke did downclimb, this is a much more difficult descent,"" he said. Vietti's home is Longview, Washington; Nolan's is Portland, Oregon. Gullberg was from Des Moines, Washington. Mount Hood rises 11,239 feet above sea level, with a base that stretches across 92 miles (148 km). It is the highest mountain in Oregon, a dormant volcano with steam constantly spewing from holes, according to the Web site mthood.org.","""Could they be alive? Yes,"" expert says.

"(CNN)  -- Walk into any sleek West Elm store, and the first thing you're likely to see is a giant red banner emblazoned with a white peace symbol. Peace is pretty. Browse Pottery Barn Teen, and you'll be dazzled by backlit peace signs and multicolored peace-sign bedding. Peace is cool. Visit the ubiquitous Gap store and find peace within reach on T-shirts and bracelets. Peace is accessible, at least as an accessory. Where are the protesters passionately waving hand-drawn peace signs at marches, calling for an end to war? What happened to ""Give peace a chance"" rather than ""Give peace a place in your wardrobe""? The notion of peace has been corroded to the point that it's as fragile as a Christmas ornament. Or as dubious as a prize doled out to a president at war. Fittingly, President Obama's Nobel speech acknowledged the paradox of being honored for contributing to world peace while sending more young Americans to kill and die in Afghanistan. Rationalizing the contradiction, he apologetically characterized humanity as caught in the throes of our own evolution, from who we are to who we ought to be. But what will spark that progress, from waging war to living peace? It's difficult to expect peace to take root beyond symbols and words if the symbols lose their meaning and the words ring hollow.  How will we ever evolve if we always choose pragmatism and fear over idealism and hope? When will peace truly have its season? For starters, we must know what peace is and what it's worth. And we must practice it rather than wait for its miraculous arrival. We must stop viewing ""peace"" as the cry of the weak and ""war"" as the act of the strong. We must not envision peace as isolationist inaction or the mere absence of conflict. Peace is a proactive choice we make in our personal lives every day. We must do the same as a nation. In order to embrace peace, we must believe it's worth doing so. Ponder all the lives lost at war. Consider the sacrifice endured by our brave soldiers and their families. Weigh the enormous cost to our struggling economy. Not only would thousands of lives be spared by peace, but millions more would benefit by the constructive use of the vast resources squandered on war. Diseases might be cured. World hunger might be eliminated. Prosperity and fulfillment might replace poverty and suffering around the globe. Peace is worth it. And it's certainly not for the weak but rather for those courageous enough to take a risk. Evolution begins with one mutation that turns out to be better, higher, smarter, stronger. Making the leap requires faith in our own ability to lead the world by example through this evolutionary process. Peace is a bold but calculated risk, a brave and noble choice. Gandhi said, ""Each one has to find his peace from within. And peace to be real must be unaffected by outside circumstances."" Pacifist A.J. Muste once declared, ""There is no way to peace. Peace is the way."" Martin Luther King Jr. said, ""Peace is not merely a distant goal that we seek but a means by which we arrive at that goal."" What I take from these wise thinkers is that peace starts with us and our actions. Peace is not passive. It's not something we can put off forever. We must practice peace in order to attain it. As citizens, we must demand it. Only then will elected officials -- and others around the world -- follow our lead. So when we purchase peace signs, let's honor their meaning: . The peace symbol, created in 1958 by designer Gerald Holtom, combines the signals in semaphore for the letters ""N"" and ""D,"" standing for nuclear disarmament. By the 1960s, it was adopted by anti-war protesters of the baby boom generation, perhaps explaining its now nostalgic allure in boomer-frequented retail establishments, where the only conflict is whether to pick a throw pillow in sage, cranberry or chartreuse. Just as we must not allow peace to become a meaningless trinket, we mustn't allow the prize to become a parody. Instead, we must remember the passion with which that peace sign was first hoisted at marches on capitols and on campuses. We must recall the fervor and nobility with which Nobel laureates like Gandhi and King gave their lives pursuing nonviolent solutions. And we must stand for peace, in our actions, in our expectations of our leaders, and in our votes. We cannot simply consume peace as an illusion. We must stop talking about peace in terms of who we ought to be and start making it who we are. Because the day we stop fighting for peace is the day peace will be ours. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rudy Ruiz.","Rudy Ruiz writes that ""peace"" has been reduced to meaningless symbol .
Peace is not for weak; not just isolationist inaction or absence of conflict, Ruiz says .
He writes that peace is noble, contagious action practiced by those with higher purpose .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Al Qaeda in Iraq is trying to foment sectarian tensions by attacking and killing Iraqi civilians, a government spokesman said Monday. Iraqi women gather near the site of an attack in the village of al-Khazna, near Mosul, on Monday. Explosions across the country have killed 50 and wounded 231 others, most of them civilians in Shiite areas, according to Interior Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Abdul Karim Khalaf. ""Most of the terrorist attacks carried out by al Qaeda in Iraq were against civilians and not Iraqi security forces,"" Khalaf said. ""This is an indication that al Qaeda in Iraq cannot face the Iraqi security forces."" Monday's deadliest attack happened near the northern city of Mosul when two truck bombs destroyed 32 homes, killing 30 people and burying others in the rubble, officials said. The bombs targeted al-Khazna village, which is inhabited by a Shiite Shabak ethnic group. The village is an area disputed between Kurds and Arabs. Car bombings and a roadside bomb in Baghdad killed 18 others on Monday, most of them Shiites. ""This is the card that al Qaeda in Iraq is now playing by targeting mostly Shiite areas and neighborhoods to agitate the sectarian violence,"" Khalaf said. ""But this will not happen because Iraqi security forces and Iraqi people in general are aware of this losing game and they will not fall into this trap."" On Monday afternoon, two children -- brothers aged 5 and 9 -- were killed when a roadside bomb detonated near them as they played in a yard in northern Tikrit, about 99 miles (160 km) north of Baghdad, a police official said. The attacks come after a series of bombings in Iraq on Friday, mostly aimed at Shiite targets, which killed 50 and wounded 154 others. Friday's deadliest attack happened when a suicide car bomb exploded near a Shiite mosque where a funeral was taking place, killing 38. Last week's attacks occurred at the end of a Shiite Muslim celebration marking the birthday of Imam Mohammed al-Mehdi, the last of 12 historic imams revered by Shiites. Pilgrims participating in such celebrations have been the target of similar attacks by Sunnis. The bombings sparked fears of sectarian violence and called into question the ability of Iraqi forces. The United States pulled back its combat troops from Iraqi cities and towns on June 30, leaving security responsibilities to the Iraqis and remaining only in a training and advisory capacity. The U.S. military continues to conduct combat operations in areas outside cities and towns. Khalaf said the recent attacks are part of ""an escalation of violence"" over the past two months ahead of national elections in January. ""The enemy of Iraq wants to bring down political progress in the country,"" he said.","Dozens dead, 231 wounded, houses destroyed from bombings .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Global warming concerns took center stage Monday as two organizations held rallies to draw attention to an issue that President Barack Obama has promised to place near the top of his agenda. Demonstrators stand outside the Capitol Power Plant in Washington on Monday to protest the plant's use of coal. A group of young protesters gathered in front of the Capitol to rally on behalf of legislation to reduce carbon emissions, decrease dependence on coal and oil, and speed a national drive toward ""clean"" energy. Later Monday, hundreds of representatives of a coalition of environmental, public health, social justice and other advocacy organizations marched around Capitol Hill and encircled a Washington coal-fired power plant to highlight the issue of climate change. The group, protesting the Capitol Power Plant's use of coal, stood in front of the plant's gated entrances. The plant powers the heating and cooling systems in the Capitol, as well as roughly a dozen other federal office buildings on Capitol Hill. ""The Capitol Power Plant, sitting just blocks from Capitol Hill, symbolizes the stranglehold coal has over our government and future,"" the group said on its Web site. ""It's not the largest or the dirtiest power plant in the country, but as the plant that is actually run by and for Congress it serves as an incredibly iconic symbol of what is wrong with our country's energy and climate policy."" No arrests were made as a result of the protest, which ""didn't affect the operations of the power plant,"" Capitol police Sgt. Kimberly Schneider said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid released a letter Thursday calling for the plant to convert to 100 percent natural gas by the end of 2009. ""Taking this major step toward cleaning up the Capitol Power Plant's emissions would be an important demonstration of Congress' willingness to deal with the enormous challenges of global warming, energy independence and our inefficient use of finite fossil fuels,"" they wrote. Several members of Congress and environmental leaders addressed the earlier rally, which was held at the conclusion to Power Shift '09, a four-day environmental summit organized by the Energy Action Coalition. The coalition describes itself as an umbrella organization of 700 groups fighting for ""clean energy solutions and the creation of a new green economy."" It's time to ""turn up the political heat in Washington so we can turn down the heat on Mother Earth,"" Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, told the crowd. ""The science tells us that the time for talking about this problem is over. The time for action is now."" The concept of ""clean coal"" is a ""dirty lie,"" added environmental activist Robert F. Kennedy. ""The most important thing you can do is not to change your light bulb but to change [members of Congress who have been] corrupted by ... dirty, filthy industry."" America needs to be freed from the ""carbon cronies,"" who are part of the ""biggest threat to civilization,"" Kennedy said.","Two protests on global warming issues hit Washington .

"Pago Pago,  American Samoa (CNN) -- When an earthquake-triggered tsunami cascaded into this tiny island in late September, the result was 34 lives lost and untold millions in property damage. But a CNN investigation to air on tonight's ""AC 360"" has uncovered an array of unsettling facts that point to a single conclusion: this natural disaster was in many ways a man-made tragedy. Public records show that the Department of Homeland Security had awarded millions of federal dollars in grants for disaster preparedness here, including the construction of an island-wide siren warning system. But all the federal funding was frozen in early 2007 after DHS inspectors found that the local American Samoan government had been diverting millions of those dollars for its own uses. Birdsall Alailima, director of American Samoa's territorial office of Homeland Security from 2003 through 2007, now lives in southern Illinois, not far from St. Louis, Missouri. He showed CNN on a map exactly where on the island the sirens were to have been placed. Thirty towers in all, he said, with 30 sirens that could have been activated by the push of a single button. ""You're saying that the systems should have been in place?"" CNN correspondent Drew Griffin asked him. ""Absolutely,"" Alailima said. ""And people died as a result?"" ""Yes."" He's not the only one who thinks so. Federal sources told CNN they believe that had the warning system been built, the death toll would likely have been lower. In American Samoa, however, territorial Gov. Togiola Tulafono, told CNN that he knew of no viable plan for the siren system. ""There was a study, I believe, but never a plan for a system,"" the governor said. ""I was trying to get verification of what happened to that system, but I could not get the definite information."" Alailima said he was fired by the governor when the federal funding was frozen, and that the governor was aware of the preparations. ""I'm not going to fault them for freezing the funds,"" Tulafono said. ""These are federal funds that they have oversight responsibility for and they saw fit to freeze the funds."" The governor told CNN he had tried to correct the problem by firing his entire homeland security staff. But, he said, that failed to solve the problem. ""All I'm saying is we have tried to work with them and have tried to get partial releases (of the money), and so far that hasn't happened."" A federal official calls the governor's statement ""nonsense."" American Samoa would have access to the frozen funds if it had agreed to pay back even some of the money it misused, said the official. The government and the governor refused, and the tsunami siren system was stopped, according to the official. A spokesman for the governor's office later declined comment on the nature of the negotiations. American Samoan government officials said they purchased another warning system -- radios that would have triggered alarms across the island. But during the CNN interview, Tulafono conceded that the system ""was not in place"" when the tsunami struck. CNN has learned that the FBI is now conducting an investigation into exactly what did happen to the federal preparedness dollars sent to American Samoa. It was launched, sources tell CNN, by the Interior Department as its Insular Affairs office has federal administrative responsibility for the island. The FBI investigation is only the latest and most recent attempt by the federal government to try to track what one federal official told CNN was ""endemic"" corruption on the island. Here are only a few instances of the alleged corruption: . â¢ Both the current Samoan lieutenant governor and a former state senator are under federal indictment on allegations of fraud, bribery and conspiracy. A trial is pending in Washington because there are no federal courts on the island. Attorneys for both men have refuted the indictment in court filings and say their clients are innocent of all the charges. â¢ An inspector general's report by the Department of Homeland Security issued in May 2007 cites numerous examples of American Samoan officials misusing federal grant money. The report's findings include the purchase of six flat-screen televisions for more than $25,000; purchase of executive leather chairs for $4,000; spending $77,000 on equipment no auditor could find; and extensive travel and entertainment charges, including money spent in Las Vegas, Nevada, by a Samoan official for a conference he was scheduled to have attended in Colorado. â¢ The DHS letter freezing its funding was sent on January 12, 2007. The action was taken because ""we have found that Homeland Security Grant funds have been diverted to uses by State government offices for other than the intended use of Homeland Security funds. This is not only in violation of public trust but In Lieu of agreement as well."" In the Samoan villages destroyed by the tsunami, stories of corruption are not new. ""The government here gets a lot of money from the U.S. federal government,"" Heinrich Tavai told CNN as he watched members of his Lofatonoa Pentacostal Church help in the clean up. ""Every year, they get millions and millions of dollars. As you see, we look like a Third World country when we should be looking more like a U.S. territory."" In half a dozen villages either wiped out or badly damaged by the tsunami, CNN could find no visible evidence of local government assistance. Workers from a tuna fish processing plant were helping in one village; in another, students from an island community college were dredging rubbish out of a stream. Red Cross officials distributed tents in other villages. Children in another village were hauling furniture on their backs to help clear the debris. When asked about the seeming lack of local government assistance, the governor told CNN, ""Our departments are out there working and working very hard, and to say they haven't seen any assistance is totally false."" Since 1995, American Samoa has received nearly $2 billion in federal grants from nearly every federal agency. On average the 65,000-population -- the size of a typical American suburb -- receives about $250 million in federal money each year. Congressional sources tell CNN that oversight has always been a problem because of Samoa's isolation and the expense involved in even mounting an investigation. ""They can do half a dozen investigations in Wyoming or California for the amount just one investigation would cost in Samoa,"" a source told CNN. Federal sources said they don't believe any official is getting rich off the U.S. Treasury. Instead, they said, federal funds -- including disaster-preparedness money that was to have gone to the warning system -- were instead used to create local government jobs in an economy almost totally dependent on U.S. federal grants. Moreover, the source added, each federal agency may have many employees whose jobs are to allocate federal funds, but only a relative handful whose jobs are to ""manage"" or account for that money. In an e-mail to CNN, an Interior Department spokeswoman said that in previous administrations ""there were real issues of neglect and failed oversight that must be addressed quickly, thoroughly and responsibly."" ""We will help the islands rebuild and recover,"" said Kendra Barkoff, ""but taxpayer dollars will be invested with strong oversight and full accountability.""","34 people died in last month's tsunami that smashed into American Samoa .

"KANDARA, Kenya (CNN) -- Daniel Mungai's family keeps him locked in a room in a wooden shack that is just big enough to fit a bed, a cupboard, Daniel and his wheel-chair. His clothes and bed are soaked with his own waste -- and he's been living like this for 15 years. Daniel Mungai is kept locked away in a small wooden shack and has been for 15 years. Daniel, 35, started having seizures at a young age. He is sometimes given medicine for epilepsy and spent time at a mental hospital but his parents say they simply cannot afford to maintain proper care -- they are struggling to cope. Both his parents are also now too old to help him properly. They live in the same compound in Kandara, Kenya, but in a different building. His father, Ndung'u Joroge, said: ""We don't lock him out of bad will. We lock him up because people have become very bad. He may come out here and then he is caught by young men, that is why we lock him in the house."" The desperate measures Daniel's family has resorted to are not rare. African health services are often underfunded and overwhelmed -- no more so in the field of mental health.  Watch more about the story Â» . CNN visited rural Kenya -- a country where less than one percent of the health budget is allotted to mental health -- to investigate the extent of the problems. Edah Maina, who runs the Kenya Society for the Mentally Handicapped, says the mentally disabled in Kenya have few options for long-term care and support. ""The entire family is affected and especially when the mother sort of loses hope and resorts to locking up the child because they have to go out and earn a living or they have to chain them up because they might hurt themselves,"" said Maina. Social workers in Kenya searching for those in desperate need found a mother and child on the floor of a squalid kitchen hut. John is 17 and severely handicapped. He cannot speak and cannot properly hold his head up. He has been living like this his whole life. When CNN met with him, he and his mother were lying on a thin, filthy blanket. His mother, Jane, is mildly mentally disabled. She does what she can for her son, but John spends so much time on his side that he suffers from severe bedsores. They depend on help from their impoverished family and they haven't eaten for days. Maina said: ""I think that some of these social needs are beyond the family capacity to handle the normal day to day life needs, and as you can see the burden of disability increased for this particular family when the son to this girl with mental disabilities was also born with mental disability and then the severity of mental disability of the son became more severe because the mother ... is herself with mental disability."" She added: ""First and foremost, nobody would want to live like this, it's inhumane, it is not what we want to see people live, it is not the lifestyle that anybody would want. What I am saying is that this home is suffering."" Maina said that even with years of experience working with the vulnerable, the cases still shock her. Her poorly funded charity does what it can, sometimes acting on the tips of neighbors. The Director of Mental Health in Kenya told CNN that they were trying their best to help the mentally disabled and mentally ill, but that the needs were 'enormous' -- and the funding was far too little. Dr. David Kiima told CNN there are only 50 active psychiatrists in the country to serve a population of more than 30 million. It is hard to believe that 15-year-old Joseph could hurt himself or anyone else. But he is on powerful anti-psychotic drugs and his mother and grandmother struggle to handle him. Grandmother Prisca Njeri said: ""When the drugs finish he beats himself and he bites himself when the drugs finish."" She does not know what they will do when Joseph gets bigger and they have no access to proper care. When his family leaves to work on their small patch of land, they lock Joseph up in a dark room. Here, too, the place reeks. They are a loving family and are conflicted about what they have to do. ""He is afraid of entering that room. We put him in when we want to leave to go to the farm because he will get lost if we leave him outside,"" Njeri said. Like so many families with limited means in Kenya, they feel compelled to make this awful decision: locking their loved ones away from society just to keep them safe from themselves and those who would do them harm.","Mental health patients in Kenya find themselves locked in shacks by their families .

"(CNN) -- Organizers of a tennis tournament in Dubai, criticized for banning an Israeli  player, said Tuesday they were trying to protect the woman from anti-Israel protests. Shahar Peer told CNN she learned of her visa ban Saturday, just before her scheduled flight to Dubai. ""The Tournament respects Ms. Shahar Peer as a professional tennis player on the Tour and understands her disappointment,"" the organizers wrote in a statement. ""Ms. Peer personally witnessed protests against her at another tournament in New Zealand only a few weeks ago. ""We do not wish to politicize sports, but we have to be sensitive to recent events in the region and not alienate or put at risk the players and the many tennis fans of different nationalities that we have here."" Peer was scheduled to fly to the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, but was informed on Saturday night by telephone that she would not be granted a visa.  Watch Peer describe her disappointment Â» . This sparked a response from the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour that it could drop Dubai from the World Tennis Tour calendar. ""I am confident that the Tour will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,"" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. ""There should be no place for politics or discrimination in professional tennis or indeed any sport."" Peer has experienced a ""tremendous outpouring of support and empathy"" from fans, friends and fellow players, but agrees with the Tour decision to go ahead with this week's Dubai Open. WTA chairman and chief executive officer Larry Scott had said: ""The Sony Ericsson WTA Tour believes very strongly, and has a clear rule and policy, that no host country should deny a player the right to compete at a tournament for which she has qualified by ranking."" Scott noted this is not the first time Dubai has taken this type of action. Last year an Israeli men's doubles team was denied entry while Andy Ram, a member of Israel's Davis Cup team, is scheduled to compete in next week's men's competition. World No. 6 Venus Williams told The New York Times: ""All the players support Shahar. We are all athletes, and we stand for tennis."" On Tuesday in Dubai, Venus rushed to a 6-0 6-1 win over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova whose Russian compatriot and second seed Dinara Safina suffered a shock exit against Virginie Razzano, of France, 6-2 6-4. Top-seeded Serena Williams came from behind to oust Italian Sara Errani 4-6 6-2 6-0 and Serbian third seed Jelena Jankovic beat Monica Niculescu of Romania 6-3 6-2 in an earlier second round encounter.","Israeli tennis player Shahar Peer denied entry for Dubai tournament .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- Two newlyweds are fighting for the dismissal of the justice of the peace who refused them a marriage license because they are of different races. A Louisiana justice of the peace refused to perform a marriage for Beth and Terence McKay. ""We've retained an attorney, and we're in the process of taking the next steps in order to make sure that (the justice of the peace) loses his job,"" Beth McKay told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Monday. She and her husband, Terence McKay, stepped into the national spotlight when Keith Bardwell, a justice of the peace for Tangipahoa Parish's 8th Ward, refused them a license. They ultimately got a marriage license from another justice of the peace in the same parish. Despite a national uproar and a call by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal for him to lose his license, Bardwell, 56, said he has no regrets. ""It's kind of hard to apologize for something that you really and truly feel down in your heart you haven't done wrong,"" he told CNN affiliate WAFB on Saturday. He insisted he is not racist and does not treat black people differently. He said he does not perform mixed-race marriages because he is concerned about the children of such marriages. Bardwell did not return calls from CNN. Beth McKay, 30, said she was speaking with Bardwell's wife by phone about getting a marriage license and was ""shocked"" to be asked whether they are an interracial couple.  Watch how justice's decision shocked couple Â» . ""She said, 'Well, what's the deal? Is he black, or are you black?' And so I answered her question, and then she just said, 'Well, we don't do interracial marriages.'"" Terence McKay, 32, told CNN, ""Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but he's absolutely wrong on all aspects of his stance."" McKay added, ""If it wasn't for interracial couples today, we wouldn't have our president. So for him to take that outlook, that's still like 1800s or something."" ""A lot of people have come up to us and said, 'You know, we're in interracial relationships as well,' not just black and white, and just encouraged us to stand up for our rights and to speak out against things like this,"" Beth McKay said. The incident ""caught us completely off guard,"" said Terence McKay, ""and we're just trying to live our lives."" The National Urban League called for an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, saying in a statement that Bardwell's actions were ""a huge step backward in social justice."" The U.S. Supreme Court tossed out race-based limitations on marriage in the landmark 1967 Loving v. Virginia case. In the unanimous decision, the court said that ""Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.""","Couple were denied marriage license because they are of different races .

"(CNN) -- It was the kind of phone call military families dread receiving from Iraq and Afghanistan -- not from Texas. Peggy McCarty's daughter called Thursday afternoon to say she had been wounded by a gunshot in her left shoulder. Keara Bono, 21, assured her mother that she was OK, but McCarty's heart skipped. She knew she had much to fear when Bono, an Army specialist, arrived at Fort Hood to prepare for an early December deployment to Iraq. But McCarty never thought she would have to worry about her child getting wounded on American soil. ""I thought I was more worried about her going over to Iraq than here, just doing training in Texas. She just got there yesterday,"" McCarty told CNN affiliate KSHB-TV in Kansas City, Missouri. Bono was one of 30 people hurt when a soldier opened fire on a military processing center at Fort Hood, the place where soldiers report before they head to war. They get medical and dental checkups there. They settle finances and even make out their wills. Thursday, the center turned into a killing field, and 13 lives were abruptly cut short. America watched in horror the news of the shootings, the deadliest ever on a military base. Some of the victims, such as Bono, were preparing to head to Iraq or Afghanistan. They were felled instead in the place they called home. When the shouts of ""Shots fired! Shots fired!"" started, one soldier pushed and shoved people to get out the back of the readiness center. And run. The soldier, who did not want to be identified, heard more screaming. Soldiers were dragging bodies away from the shooter. They snatched tablecloths off tables, cut up their own sage-green digital combat uniforms, even their tan undershirts, and turned them into tourniquets and pressure bandages. Everyone tried to render CPR and medical aid. Some were medical personnel. Others were simply friends helping friends. They were soldiers, after all, and trained as combat lifesavers, though they could not have imagined having to use their skills at home. But soldiers never abandon wounded comrades on the battlefield. Most of the injured were awake and alert, witnesses recalled. They just weren't talking. About a mile away at Darnall Army Medical Center, Army medic Spc. Eric Blohm waited for mass casualties. If the emergency rooms filled up, Darnall would put victims in rooms where usually babies are brought into the world. It felt too much like Blohm's tour of Iraq. ""I'm pretty shocked and bewildered,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""Going to war and experiencing combat overseas and then ... to have your sense of security shattered, that's just kind of unreal."" Watch Blohm describe the scene . The shooting suspect, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, was a psychiatrist who had an office at Darnall. Now, the hospital was taking in the doctor's alleged victims. Sirens, installed after the September 11, 2001, attacks, sound routinely at Fort Hood during emergency drills. Pam Stephenson, the wife of a Judge Advocate General officer, was used to the blaring noise. Early afternoon, she was about to make a quick trip to the grocery with Megan, her 5-year-old who stayed at home sick on Thursday. But then she heard the whirring of choppers overhead and warnings on the loudspeakers: ""Take cover. Stay away from windows. Lock your doors."" Her husband called and told her not to leave the house. She turned on the television and learned the grim news. The gunman, she discovered, was a soldier. ""When you hear it's soldiers gone crazy -- you don't know what kind of ammunition or guns they have,"" she said. She wanted to fetch Patrick, 2, stuck at day care, but the sprawling post was under lockdown. No one knew then if there were killers on the loose. The streets were deserted. A mass of cars, waiting to get out, piled up at the gates. Loved ones waited on the other side, desperate for news of their soldiers. Stephenson checked Facebook and read a message from a military friend serving overseas. Deployed soldiers from Fort Hood were in a panic not knowing whether their families were safe. She checked on the soldier's wife and worried about Patrick. Finally, at 7:15, she was able to see her baby. Many miles away in Punta Gorda, Florida, Roxanne Johnson was chitchatting with her son, Justin, on the phone. He was a young track vehicle mechanic who was heading to Afghanistan come January. Mother and son joked and laughed, like they always did. And then she heard a strange noise: ""Dosh, dosh, dosh."" What was that? she wondered. ""At first I thought he was just kidding around and turning up the video game, and then I said, well, maybe it's a training exercise,"" Johnson told CNN affiliate WINK News in Fort Myers, Florida. She pressed the phone to her ear and listened. She heard the screams and the crying. Wow, she thought. It sounds so real. Her son's voice was gone. She refused to hang up until she could hear Justin again. She heard people shuffling about and muffled voices. Where was Justin? Had he been hurt? What was going on? ""Justin, call home!"" she said aloud. Hours passed before Johnson learned the fate of her son. He was one of the shooting victims. But Justin Johnson was one of the lucky ones. He underwent surgery and was recovering Thursday night. Roxanne Johnson breathed a sigh of relief and was able finally to disconnect her phone.","Parents worry about dangers overseas, not in Texas .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Coagulated sheep's blood. Pig knuckles. Snake bile. Fried crickets. Sound like ingredients you might see bubbling away in a caldron, right? Zane Lamprey raises a toast to alcoholic beverages the world over. Well, these are just some of the unusual items Zane Lamprey has eaten -- yes, eaten -- during the course of his day job. No, he's not a human garbage disposal. Lamprey is a comedian who hosts a TV program about drinking, ""Three Sheets."" The show follows him all over the world as he samples local libations. Lamprey also claims to be in search of the ultimate hangover cure, which is why he's often called upon to ingest the indigestible. Not that the drinks are any better. Anyone for a shot of Belize rum that's had a dead snake fermenting in it for about a year? If the locals drink it, so will Lamprey. ""I'll try anything once,"" he said, adding that ""there's certainly a lot that I won't drink twice.""  Watch Lamprey use sword to open champagne Â» . Gross stuff aside, Lamprey has what many consider to be a dream job. And although he occasionally gets a little bleary-eyed, the Californian maintains that it's not a show about getting inebriated. ""I drink to try new things, to learn about drinking cultures or new drinks,"" Lamprey said. ""Sometimes levels of inebriation are the by-product of my job, but I'm certainly not going out looking to do that. If I did I think I'd be the wrong person for the job."" We caught up with Lamprey in New York's Bubble Lounge, where he was preparing (soberly, mind you) to use a sword to lop off the end of a champagne bottle, glass neck and all. It's a ritual he says started in the Napoleonic era as a way to celebrate victories at battle. While Lamprey might not be as battle-scarred as Napoleon's men, he does have a victory to celebrate: ""Three Sheets"" has a new home after being put in limbo for several months after its original network went off the air. The show now airs on the Fine Living Network, which has just popped the cork on ""Three Sheets' "" fourth season. New episodes air Monday nights at 10 p.m. ET and repeat throughout the week. Besides demonstrating how one sabers champagne, Lamprey talked to CNN about dealing with thumping hangovers, staying in shape and other challenges of hosting a TV show about alcohol. The following is an edited version of the transcript. CNN: Do you consider yourself a professional drinker? Zane Lamprey: I get paid to drink. If I got paid to play baseball, I'd be a professional baseball player, right? Yeah. So I guess I am a professional drinker. CNN: By now you must have discovered a cure for a hangover. Lamprey: There is no cure. Actually, there's two. Either don't drink, or don't stop. Once you break one of those, you get into trouble. We've found remedies, things that'll make it a little easier. I've jumped in freezing water, I've done just about everything, and nothing has wiped out my hangover. CNN: Where were you when you had your worst hangover? Lamprey: Oddly enough, I was in a place that I was promised by several people I would not get a hangover: Champagne, France. They said if you drink good champagne, you can drink as much as you want, and you won't get a hangover. So I put it to the test, and the next day, I had the worst hangover yet. It was horrible. Oh. So bad. CNN: In Iceland, you drank something called ""Black Death,"" the same name given to the pandemic that nearly wiped out Europe centuries ago. Taste good? Lamprey: I'm sure it tasted better than the plague, but not by much. It tasted like something that people shouldn't want to drink, like vodka mixed with black licorice and dirt. When I stepped off the plane, I was dying to try it. Then once I tried it, I was dying to drink something to get that taste out of my mouth. CNN: You've said that one of the worst things you've had to drink was viper rum in Belize, which had a dead snake soaking in it. What does a snake taste like? Lamprey: A dead snake tastes like what a dead snake smells like. When I actually had to smell the shot, which I was told not to do, I almost hurled. I managed to get it down, and I think I chased it with a piece of watermelon rolled in sugar. CNN: What does your doctor say about the state of your liver? Lamprey: I have one. It's sitting on my counter at home, and it's completely fine. ... When I finished this last season, I did go and get a full checkup, and I'm completely fine. CNN: How do you stay in shape while shooting ""Three Sheets""? Lamprey: I don't. Go look at a clip of me doing the show. I'm probably about 23 pounds heavier. I have taken my shirt off, and when I watch that sometimes I get a little, ""Oh, God."" But that makes me an everyman. People want to see an everyman. They don't want to see some guy who's all put together, which clearly I'm not. I don't profess to know anything about booze. I learn it from the people that show me. CNN: Do you find that generally everybody's attitude toward drinking is the same the world over? Lamprey: Absolutely. Everyone drinks to enjoy themselves. Everyone goes out with their friends because they're looking to have a good time. That's the same everywhere. CNN: You spend all this time in bars around the world ... your crew must be tempted to drink. Lamprey: Tempted to drink? Fact: I cannot keep up with my crew. CNN: So your camera operator has shot you drunk? Lamprey: I would say yes. CNN: That explains why sometimes you look blurry.

"(CNN) -- A wildfire in Yellowstone National Park has grown to 9,300 acres and closed a section of the main road through the park, but Yellowstone is still open and National Park Service officials said Monday there was no danger to travelers. Lightning started the fire on September 13. Snow could fall this week at Yellowstone, which sprawls across parts of three states, and end the park's fire season, officials said. National Park Service officials said the lightning-sparked wildfire started on September 13, but wasn't noticed until 10 days later in the Arnica Creek area east of Old Faithful, the geyser that is the park's main attraction. Last week the fire increased in size and by this weekend had charred 6,500 acres. National Park Service spokeswoman Linda Miller said there was no danger for guests. ""We don't anticipate it affecting any buildings,"" she said. Miller said Monday that 90 percent of the fire was in Wyoming, with the remainder in park areas in Idaho and Montana. Facilities at Yellowstone were open Monday, and Miller said visitors were still welcome. ""But there's going to be smoke,"" she said. ""Where there's smoke, there's fire. The vistas won't be as clear as even just a week ago."" Still, she said, ""We don't want to scare people into not coming."" Rick Hoeninghausen, director of sales and marketing for Yellowstone National Park Lodges, said the fire was causing cancellations at the parks. But he said ""some tourists already in the park are are just changing their plans and working around it."" He said the fire is more of an inconvenience than a danger. ""It's a natural part of this environment. It's part of the ecology and it's a natural attraction for some people,"" Hoeninghausen said. The Arnica fire has closed Grand Loop Road, the main road through Yellowstone. Visitors wanting to get from one end of the wilderness area to the other will have to take a 280-mile detour. Yellowstone National Park has nine lodges and about 2,200 hotel rooms. At least two of those facilities close each year after Labor Day. Hoeninghausen said the fire ""may be a little disconcerting for East Coasters not used to wildfires, but travelers and tourists can call the park and check the Web sites for updates on the fires."" A Park Service press release cautioned that ""the smokey conditions are affecting air quality in the park."" ""People with weakened immune systems and those with heart and lung conditions may have trouble breathing,"" the press release said. The Arnica fire was becoming more active Monday as gustier winds and low humidity fueled the flames, said Tom Kempton, fire information officer for the park service. The National Weather Service in Wyoming predicted snow would fall by Wednesday morning. Kempton said 230 firefighters, 15 fire engines and five helicopters were helping keep flames away from any historic structures at Yellowstone. Lightning starts an average of 22 fires every year in Yellowstone, according to the park service. Most of the naturally started fires in the 2.2 million-acre park extinguish on their own. Yellowstone is a fire-adapted ecosystem, and fire plays a major role in maintaining the health of the area's wildlife and vegetation by clearing old underbrush and allowing for new growth.","NEW: Fire no danger to visitors, but they'll notice smoke, park service says .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The Afghan government will change a law that critics say legalizes rape within marriage for Shia Muslims, President Hamid Karzai told CNN Thursday. Critics had feared that Afghanistan's new Shiite law would set the nation backward. Karzai told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that he and others were unaware of the provision in the legislation, which he said ""has so many articles."" Karzai signed the measure into law last month. ""Now I have instructed, in consultation with clergy of the country, that the law be revised and any article that is not in keeping with the Afghan constitution and Islamic Sharia must be removed from this law,"" Karzai said. The president's comments came one day after several hundred demonstrators faced off over the law, which critics say prevents women from declining their husband's request for sexual intercourse and essentially legalizes marital rape. The measure applies to the 20 percent of Afghans who are Shia Muslims. It was part of a nearly 270-page piece of legislation that was written to solidify the identity of the Shia minority in Afghanistan. The bill languished in the country's parliament for a year-and-a-half before it was recently pushed through in what one legislator called a ""chaotic"" vote. Women from various parts of Afghanistan marched in the capital Wednesday to protest the law, which has also been criticized by human-rights groups and Western leaders, including U.S. President Barack Obama.  Watch Karzai react to controversial law ahead of Thursday's comments Â» . When the demonstrators reached a mosque housing a school run by a conservative Shia cleric who helped implement the law, students came out yelling and cursing and pelted the women with gravel, said Fawzia Koofi, a female member of the Afghan parliament. Koofi said police did little to protect the women, but a spokesman for the country's interior minister disputed that. ""Police played a completely neutral role,"" said spokesman Zamarai Bashiri. ""The police were able to control the demonstrations very well."" About 300 to 500 women protested the law while 600 to 700 demonstrators marched in support of it, he said. The marchers who opposed the law included several female members of Afghanistan's parliament. ""Both sides were able to express their thoughts and expressions,"" Bashiri said. The law has drawn much criticism.  Watch a report on the law Â» . ""I think this law is abhorrent,"" Obama said recently. ""We think that it is very important for us to be sensitive to local culture, but we also think that there are certain basic principles that all nations should uphold, and respect for women and respect for their freedom and integrity is an important principle."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel also weighed in. ""We very much hope that the draft piece of legislation is to be withdrawn,"" Merkel has said.","Afghan law appears to let a man to have sex with his wife even when she says ""no""

"Washington (CNN) -- A State Department employee who resigned last month in protest over America's war in Afghanistan said Friday he has received an outpouring of support from Afghan-Americans and U.S. active-duty military. ""I've had a lot of Afghan-Americans contact me and say, 'Matt, you get it,' "" Matthew Hoh told CNN. ""You understand -- yes, there is a civil war going on. You understand how Afghan society works. You understand this split within the Pashtuns. You understand valley-ism, or whatever you want to call it."" The 36-year-old former Marine Corps captain resigned on September 10 over what he termed a ""cavalier, politically expedient and Pollyannaish misadventure."" Since then, even active-duty military have supported his decision, he said on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" scheduled to air at 1 p.m. ET Sunday on CNN. ""I have received many many e-mails from active-duty military and some guys who just separated from the service,"" Hoh said. ""Some guys are here in the States. I've gotten many e-mails from guys in Afghanistan. Some are people I know. But a lot are people I do not know. Men and women who are saying, 'Thanks for doing this. Keep it up. We don't know why we're here. We're not sure why we're taking these casualties. We don't know what it's accomplishing.'"" In his letter, the senior civilian representative in Zabul Province, Afghanistan, said he was resigning because ""I fail to see the value or worth in continued U.S. casualties or expenditures of resources in support of the Afghan government in what is, truly, a 35-year-old civil war."" He concluded the letter by saying that he had ""lost confidence"" that the ""dead have sacrificed for a purpose worthy of futures lost, love vanished and promised dreams unkept."" ""I believe that the people we are fighting there are fighting us because we are occupying them,"" Hoh told CNN earlier this week. ""Not for any ideological reasons, not because of any links to al Qaeda, not because of any fundamental hatred towards the West. The only reason they're fighting us is because we're occupying them."" After Hoh submitted his resignation, Richard Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special representative in Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan, made a plea for Hoh to change his mind. Hoh refused. ""The offer was to join his staff and be put in a position where I could continue to write and try to influence policymakers from within the administration,"" Hoh said Friday. ""Two things: One, if I believed in the mission, if I believed it was worth our guys dying for, if I believed that 60,000 troops in Afghanistan would defeat al Qaeda somehow -- which it won't -- I would have stayed in Zabul Province,"" he said. ""However, the other part of it, too, was that I realized that the administration was going to make its decision shortly and then I would be stuck. And if I don't believe in it, if I don't believe this cause is right, if I don't believe it's justified, then there's no reason to take that position."" CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen disagreed with Hoh's assessment of Afghanistan. ""It's not that our presence there is causing the problem,"" he said. ""Quite the reverse: It is that we are not doing what we said were going to do, which is bringing a measure of security and a measure of prosperity."" But Afghanistan's lack of infrastructure and ""human capital"" make it an especially difficult mission, said Hoh, who served two tours in Iraq as a Marine. ""In Iraq, even though it was stuck in the '80s, it had infrastructure, it had human capital,"" he said. ""It had doctors and lawyers and educators. And they had an established system of government, they had an infrastructure we could build on. Afghanistan has none of that."" In his letter, Hoh -- who signed on in March for a yearlong, noncareer position with the State Department -- said the cost of a war with no end in sight and no clear mission was too much to bear. ""I do not believe any military force has ever been tasked with such a complex, opaque and Sisyphean mission as the U.S. military has received in Afghanistan,"" Hoh wrote. News of Hoh's resignation came as the administration continues to deliberate whether to change course in an eight-year conflict once dubbed a ""war of necessity"" by President Obama. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, reportedly has submitted a request for as many as 40,000 additional troops. McChrystal's request is being weighed against a backdrop of spiraling U.S. military fatalities. There have been 58 American military fatalities in October, making it the deadliest month for U.S. armed forces in Afghanistan since the war began in October 2001. More troops is not the way to go, Hoh said Friday. ""Increasing troops is only going to fuel insurgency. We need to stop our combat operations in areas where we are fighting people only because they are fighting us. Otherwise, it's going to be 2013, we're going to look back four years and we're going to say, ""What did we accomplish? What did we get? What was this worth? What did we get out of this?"" State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the administration respects Hoh's decision. ""We take his opinions very seriously,"" Kelly said. ""Senior officials on the ground in Afghanistan and here in Washington have talked to him, have heard him out. We respect ... his right to dissent.""","Matthew Hoh says Afghan-Americans, active-duty military members have shown support .

"(CNN) -- Torrential rains and flooding since June have affected 600,000 people in 16 West African nations, the United Nations reported Tuesday. People walk in the flooded streets of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, last week. The worst hit have been Burkina Faso, Senegal, Ghana and Niger, said Yvon Edoumou, a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, in the Senegalese capital, Dakar. So far, 159 people have died, he said. Sierra Leone has also been hard hit, according to the U.N. Edoumou said removing water from flooded areas is a top priority, but powerful pumps are in short supply. ""Some people refused to leave their homes so they are living in floodwaters,"" he said. The United Nations has not yet received reports of waterborne diseases, but Edoumou said a real threat exists of diarrhea or, worse, cholera. The U.N. World Food Programme said Tuesday it has begun distributing food to tens of thousands of homeless flood victims. WFP has set a goal of feeding 177,500 people, mainly in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, where 150,000 people have been affected and key infrastructure -- including a central hospital, schools, bridges and roads -- has been damaged. The flooding in Burkina Faso is the worst in 90 years, WFP said. Many of those in Ouagadougou most needing help were already receiving aid from WFP, but those rations were lost in the floodwaters, the U.N. reported. ""It is always the poor and vulnerable who suffer the most from floods like these as their few remaining assets are swept away, leaving them hungry and destitute,"" WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran said. Roads and buildings have been ruined from Mauritania to Niger, the U.N. reported. In Agadez, Niger, a town about 458 miles (738 km) north of the capital, Niamey, close to 988 acres (400 hectares) of vegetable crops and hundreds of livestock were washed away. Herve Ludovic de Lys, head of OCHA in West Africa, said natural disasters have a lasting effect that unravels years of progress against poverty. ""The situation is very worrying,"" he said in an OCHA statement issued Tuesday. The rainy season in West Africa begins in June and continues through late September. In 2007, 300 people died and 800,000 were affected by the storms. This year, fears abound that more heavy rain will fall in already waterlogged areas. Despite the misery, Edoumou said the rains are a mixed blessing for countries dependent on agriculture. The harvest this year will be more bountiful, he said.","U.N. begins distributing food to tens of thousands of homeless flood victims .

"(CNN) -- Move over, Edward Cullen. Tell those bayou bloodsuckers from ""True Blood"" to step aside, too. More than 112 years after he first climbed out of the coffin, the world's most famous vampire is back -- and he's bloodier than ever. ""Dracula the Un-Dead,"" released this month in the United States, is a sequel to Bram Stoker's 1897 classic written by Dacre Stoker, the original author's great-grandnephew. The book, co-written by Dracula historian Ian Holt, picks up 25 years after the Victorian-era monster is supposedly killed in the original and is based in part on 125 pages of handwritten notes that Bram Stoker left behind. But while many of the original characters are here -- troubled couple Jonathan and Mina Harker and vampire hunter Van Helsing among them -- the horror has gotten a 21st-century update. The sex and violence that Stoker deftly alluded to in the original are, at times, front and center in his descendant's sequel. ""You've got to keep in mind the perspective,"" said Dacre Stoker, a native of Montreal, Quebec, now living in Aiken, South Carolina. ""The degree of sex and violence he had, in this very stuffy and conservative Victorian society, was cutting edge at the time. Even the exposure of a woman's flesh, the piercing of the flesh, was a metaphor for the sex act."" And with authors from Anne Rice and Charlaine Harris to Stephen King and Poppy Z. Brite having crafted their own, sometimes lurid, reworkings of the vampire legend, Stoker said he knew that the new book couldn't just be a straight continuation of the first. ""We've got to keep up with what other people are doing,"" he said. ""Otherwise, our story would be toast."" Of all the books, movies and other tales to use Dracula's name throughout the decades, the novel is the first since the 1931 Bela Lugosi movie to have the Stoker family's endorsement and input. After Bram's death, his widow, Florence, sold the story's rights, and eventually, the most iconic character in the history of horror slipped into the public domain. Dacre said that before now, the only thing he'd ever received for his ancestor's work was the occasional Halloween wisecrack. ""We knew of the legacy of Bram Stoker, but as kids growing up in Montreal, it wasn't that big a deal,"" he said. ""Every now and then at Halloween you'd get joked: 'Is it safe to come to the Stoker house? Are we going to get candy or bitten in the neck?' "" It was a college writing project that revived his interest in his novelist ancestor, a native of Dublin, Ireland, who'd moved to London, England, by the time the book was written. Then, he was contacted by Holt in 2003. The historian said he wanted to work on a sequel and wanted to have a member of Stoker's family involved. Along the way, they uncovered a rare find at the Rosenbach Museum and Library in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Bram's own notes. It wasn't a plot outline, Dacre said, ""but what I did was find information, characters, little ideas -- plot threads that he had in mind 112 years ago that didn't make it into his story."" Among the seeds for new plotlines was Bram's mention of a police investigator who plays prominently in ""Dracula the Un-Dead."" Dacre said he'd always wondered at how the first book was full of murder but no police were involved. The notes also prompted the inclusion of Jack the Ripper, whose gruesome exploits gripped London around the time the elder Stoker was writing his novel and who is believed by some historians to have helped shape its plot. True fans of the vampire genre will find another historical figure they're likely familiar with gracing the book's pages and an even more unlikely appearance: Bram Stoker himself. ""Part of our plan was to paint a realistic picture of Bram Stoker,"" Dacre said of the author, who spent time as a reporter, theater critic and manager of London's Lyceum Theater. ""Everybody knows Dracula. Not many people know Bram Stoker."" Response to and reviews of the book have been largely positive. ""This daring sequel captures the essence and gothic glory of the original,"" USA Today's Carroll Memmott wrote. Dacre, who is touring the United States in support of the release, said he was prepared for the inevitable backlash from pure-blood purists who don't think the original should be sullied with a follow-up. ""I have heard just a bit of it,"" he said. ""People say it's better to leave some of these mysteries alone; let's not solve them all. Believe me, when you read our story, you'll know we don't solve them all."" And he has some other advice for those diehards: Lighten up. ""This is entertainment. Go with it,"" he said. ""If you don't want to read it, you don't have to.""","""Dracula the Un-Dead"" written by Bram Stoker's descendant Dacre .

"(CNN) -- Jury selection was under way for a second day Tuesday in the trial of a man accused in the rape and beating death of an Arkansas television anchor a year ago. Curtis Lavelle Vance, 29, would face the death penalty if convicted of charges including capital murder, rape, residential burglary and theft in the October 2008 death of Anne Pressly, 26. He has pleaded not guilty. Pressly, the morning news anchor for Little Rock, Arkansas, television station and CNN affiliate KATV, was found badly beaten and unconscious in her home and died five days later. Vance was linked to the killing through DNA, and police told CNN last year they are ""110 percent"" sure he killed Pressly. Vance has given several statements to police, including one saying he was at her home and another admitting to her slaying. Defense attorney Steve Morley told CNN affiliate WREG that such evidence presents an obstacle for them to overcome, but he said he hopes an emotional closing argument will persuade jurors to spare Vance's life. ""Literally, you can affect an individual, and by affecting that individual you affect the outcome,"" Morley told the station. Pressly's mother, Patti Cannady, told NBC last year her daughter fought for her life -- so much so that her left hand was broken. ""I found my daughter beyond recognition with every bone in her face broken, her nose broken, her jaw pulverized so badly that the bone had come out of it; I actually thought that her throat has possibly been cut,"" Cannady said. ""Her entire skull had numerous fractures from which she suffered a massive stroke."" DNA evidence has also tied Vance to a rape in April 2008 in Marianna, Arkansas, about 90 miles east of Little Rock, police said in December. Police have said they found no previous link between Vance and Pressly and do not believe her being on television played a role in the slaying. ""I think he saw her someplace, probably followed her home with the intention of robbing her,"" Lt. Terry Hastings, spokesman for Little Rock police, told CNN in December. ""And then went from there."" Pressly's purse was taken, police have said. Parties in the case are hoping to finish jury selection Tuesday, according to the Pulaski County Circuit Court clerk's office.","Man accused in rape, beating death of Anne Pressly, 26, a year ago .

"(CNN) -- Organized crime gangs are exploiting a new target for illegal profit: Medicare and Medicaid. Experienced in running drug, prostitution and gambling rings, crime groups of various ethnicities and nationalities are learning it's safer and potentially more profitable to file fraudulent claims with the federal Medicare program and state-run Medicaid plans. ""They're hitting us and hitting us hard,"" said Timothy Menke, head of investigations for the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services. ""Organized crime involvement in health care fraud is widespread."" One hot spot for health care fraud is Los Angeles, California, where Russian, Armenian and Nigerian gangs have been caught by federal agents. Recent cases include crime boss Konstantin Grigoryan, a former Soviet army colonel who pleaded guilty to taking $20 million from Medicare. Karapet ""Doc"" Khacheryan, boss of a Eurasian crime gang, was recently convicted with five lieutenants of stealing doctor identities in a $2 million scam. Two Nigerians, Christopher Iruke and his wife, Connie Ikpoh, were charged October 15 with bilking Medicare of $6 million dollars by fraudulently billing the government for electric wheelchairs and other expensive medical equipment. The two, allegedly members of an organized crime ring, entered pleas of not guilty and are being held in a federal detention center. ""They deny any allegations of wrongdoing,"" said their attorney, James Kosnett. Defrauding government-run health care programs involves stealing two types of identities: those of doctors, who bill for services, and patients, whose beneficiary numbers entitle them to medical care and necessary equipment. Criminals are expert at collecting both. Watch doctor tell what happened when his identity was stolen . ""That information is very, very valuable to these crooks. And the doctor may work at one clinic but he won't know about the second and third clinic that they've already set up using his identification,"" said Glenn Ferry, special agent in charge of the Los Angeles region for the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. ""They are definitely well-organized, well-schooled on how to commit Medicare fraud."" Dr. Gianfranco Burdi had his identity stolen when he was recruited to join what appeared to be a new medical practice near Koreatown in Los Angeles. After the managers failed to show a business license and proof of malpractice insurance, Burdi pulled out. Two years later, the FBI came calling. Agents questioned Burdi, a psychiatrist, about whether he had prescribed $800,000 worth of electric wheelchairs for Medicare patients. ""I said no. I am a psychiatrist. Why would I prescribe an electric wheelchair?"" said Burdi. ""It was shocking."" A jury found Leonard Uchenna Nwafor guilty of using Burdi's identification to bill Medicare for medically unnecessary durable medical equipment. ""I was naive enough to provide them my medical license, my other data,"" said Burdi. Patient beneficiary numbers are easy to buy along Los Angeles' Skid Row. Impoverished residents of shelters there tell CNN they've accepted cash from recruiters -- known as ""cappers"" -- to go to bogus medical clinics where they share what they call their ""red, white and blue"" -- the tri-colored Medicare card that has a beneficiary number for billing the government. ""People down here need to eat. Somebody who comes up on a quick hustle, quick money, they going to jump on. I'm one of them, I will,"" said a man who identified himself as Scott. ""They're just defrauding the patients, defrauding the government."" Jimmy Rodgers of San Bernadino, California, tells CNN he went to a clinic three times a week, receiving $100 per visit but little medical care. ""This is just like Carte Blanche,"" said Rodgers, holding his Medicare card. ""Matter of fact, better than Carte Blanche. Carte Blanche has limitations on it."" The clinics, he concedes, were clearly fronts for collecting beneficiary data. ""They were no doctors. They were just somebody who had their hand out,"" said Rodgers, who later cooperated with federal investigators. ""And they just ripping the system off and using me as a means to rip the system off."" Once criminals have doctor and patient identification numbers, they begin filing false claims. The Khacheryan gang told Medicare that health services were being provided on the 10th floor at 754 South Los Angeles Street. But there is no doctor's office in that decrepit industrial building -- only a mail drop, where the Khacheryan group collected checks from the U.S. government for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The inspector general's office of the Department of Health and Human Services estimates it is on track to recover about $4 billion this year by breaking up health care fraud schemes perpetrated by all types of criminals, from organized rings to corrupt doctors. That amount, though, is only about 5 percent of the annual health care fraud cost in the United States, according to the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association. Because government health programs operate on the honor system, law enforcement officials say it's easy for organized crime rings and average criminals to cash in at the taxpayer's expense.","Gangs make millions by getting ID numbers of doctors, patients .
Then they file fraudulent Medicare, Medicaid claims for care that never happened .
One doctor had his ID stolen, learned it was used to bill $800,000 for wheelchairs .

"LONDON, England  -- A new drug for melanoma has been shown to rapidly shrink malignant tumors in an early trial at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York. New drug inhibits BRAF, the main driver of mutation in over 50 percent of melanomas. Among 27 patients whom the experimental new drug was tested on, ""19 showed a 30 percent or greater reduction in tumor size,"" Dr. Paul Chapman, the lead researcher told CNN from a cancer conference in Berlin. Melanoma develops in cells that produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color, and is the most serious type of skin cancer. Currently the standard treatment for metastatic malignant melanoma is chemotherapy, which has only a 15 percent success rate, Chapman explained. In his trial using PLX4032 over 70 percent of patients had a response to the drug. ""Without reservation we can say this is a breakthrough in melanoma. We haven't seen a major breakthrough in this disease in the last 40 years,"" said Professor Alexander Eggermont, President of the European Cancer Organization. Seventy-five percent of the patients who were treated with PLX4032 had already received multiple treatments of other cancer drugs, all of which had failed. Two-thirds of those patients also already had what Eggermont described as ""very widespread metastatic disease."" ""There were patients who were on oxygen or on continuous morphine who were off the morphine after one or two weeks of treatment,"" Eggermont told CNN. Two patients, he said, even showed complete remission, such that all detectable melanoma ""melted away."" The other two major benefits of PLX4032 are that it can be taken orally as a pill and seems to have very mild side effects. The PLX4032 complex works by blocking the activity of cancer-causing mutation of the BRAF gene, which is implicated in more than half of all melanomas. Eggermont praised the drug for being highly-selective unlike traditional ""dirty"" cancer drugs that have a wide range of side-effects. ""The side effect profile looks very mild and we think it's because it's such a clean, super selective molecule and it's an oral drug, and that's a great asset,"" he said. Peter Hirth, CEO of the drug's maker Plexxikon explained that it is because PLX4032 is such a highly selective compound that ""doctors can adjust the dosage to really shut down tumors,"" whereas other cancer treatment drugs are frequently limited from working to their full potential because patients cannot tolerate their toxicity levels. PLX4032 is not a cure, but offers hope for alleviating symptoms and extending life. ""I've never seen this before in melanoma,"" Chapman said referring to the successful findings. ""One thing we don't know is how long these response are going to last,"" he added. The next step will now be to test the drug in a larger trial of almost 700 people, scheduled to begin this month and to be completed by the end of the year. Then a randomized test comparing chemotherapy treatment with PLX4032 therapy will need to occur before. Currently that is slated to take place across North American, Europe and Australia in the first quarter of 2010. ""We are working to make sure that within the shortest time possible we will satisfy the needs of FDA to get this drug available to melanoma patients as quickly as possible,"" Eggermont said. Early responses from peers have been supportive. In a statement Dr. Kat Arney said that ""Cancer Research UK and others have been investigating drugs that can block faulty BRAF, so it is interesting to see the results from a small-scale trial of such a drug. Melanoma is a very difficult cancer to treat and the results of this early-stage trial are promising, but larger trials need to be done before we know for sure how effective this treatment is.""","Experimental new skin cancer treatment shows 70 percent effectiveness .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- He would surely make history. But would Sen. Barack Obama's election as America's first black president transform the nation? Obama says yes. ""The day I'm inaugurated, the country looks at itself differently. And don't underestimate that power. Don't underestimate that transformation,"" Obama told the crowd Friday at the National Urban League convention in St. Louis, Missouri. The Democrat from Illinois was answering a question about the racial polarization in America. Obama said ""race is still an enormous factor in our society. But economics can overcome a lot of racial division."" The Democratic presidential hopeful also said that action, rather than high-minded discussions, is the way to end racial inequality. Obama said ""if we're doing the right thing and making sure that our young people are going to school, that they're getting good jobs, that they're starting businesses, that they're living in thriving neighborhoods and communities, that will do more to lessen racial tension, division and conflict than any set of roundtables and blue ribbon commissions are going to do."" Two of Obama's main Democratic rivals, Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-New York, and former Sen. John Edwards, D-North Carolina, also spoke about racial inequality during the Urban League convention. Clinton told the crowd that she rejects ""a conversation about 1.4 million young men as a threat, as a headache, or as a lost cause.  I reject the conversation about 1.4 million disappointments, failures, and casualties of a broken system. That is not who these young men are. I believe it is long past time for a new and different conversation. It is time for America to begin a conversation about 1.4 million future workers, entrepreneurs, taxpayers, community leaders, business executives."" Edwards addressed affirmative action, saying ""I would ensure that my administration was a representation of what affirmative action can be. I would make sure that my administration looks like America, and I mean, from the top to the bottom, all the way through the administration."" Edwards continued, saying ""I would ensure that judges that I appointed to the federal bench and justices nominated to the United States Supreme Court believed in real equality and believed in the concept of affirmative action."" Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, also spoke at the National Urban League convention, but no Republican candidates came to the presidential forum. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee met with members of the league at a gathering Thursday night. This is the second forum with a large African-American crowd that the Democratic candidates attended this month. All of the Democrats showed up in Detroit on July 12  for the presidential forum at the NAACP convention. Black voters are crucial to the Democratic Party. ""Nearly nine in 10 blacks vote Democratic, making them the most reliable Democratic voting block in the country"" said CNN Pollster Keating Holland. And they'll play an important role in picking the next Democratic presidential nominee, especially in South Carolina and Florida, two early primary states. In CNN's most recent polls, Clinton and Obama are running neck and neck among black voters nationally, though Clinton was well ahead in South Carolina. But it's still early and many voters haven't made up their minds. ""I'm not feeling that at this point either candidate would be that much of a difference"" says Amy Johnson, an undecided black voter in New Orleans, Louisiana.

"(CNN) -- The music of Woodstock was a draw that attracted hundreds of thousands of people to the festival. Similarly, the name of Ang Lee is a draw that attracted a number of actors to his new film, ""Taking Woodstock."" From left, ""Taking Woodstock's"" Emile Hirsch, director Ang Lee and Demetri Martin at the movie's premiere. ""Taking Woodstock,"" which is out August 28, features performers who were either not born or very young when the monumental festival occurred in 1969, but many were enticed to join the movie because of Lee's involvement. ""I'd read the Sunday paper for Ang Lee. I'd do anything. He's a filmmaker I've always admired and [was] sort of eager to work with,"" said Liev Schreiber, who plays a transvestite. ""So when he approached me, you know: Dress, shmess, I'll do whatever you want."" Lee's work, which includes the renowned films ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain,"" has garnered him three Oscar nominations. The lighthearted ""Taking Woodstock"" is a mild departure for a man whose films tend toward serious drama. The film's plot concerns Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin), son of the owners of a fading Catskills hotel, who helped attract the Woodstock festival to the area. It's based on Tiber's memoir. The film also stars Emile Hirsch, Jonathan Groff and Eugene Levy. The 36-year-old Martin, who is best known for his standup, his contributions to ""The Daily Show"" and hosting ""Important Things with Demetri Martin,"" might have benefited the most from working with Lee. ""Taking Woodstock"" is his first film as star, and he's made only a handful of others. ""Ang is not really going to hold your hand and reassure you through the whole thing. He's going to be more like a sensei, kind of a tough-love thing,"" Martin said. ""He's like, 'Punch this wall,' and you'll be like, 'Why?' and he's like, 'Punch the wall, and do it.' ""And then it's like, 'Oh, good performance, great. I'm glad I punched the wall,' and you don't understand, but it's really a lesson in trust,"" he added. Jonathan Groff also came to ""Taking Woodstock"" with limited big-screen experience and was excited to work with Lee. ""He's your fearless leader. He's everything that you want to be when you grow up,"" Groff said. Woodstock may have been 40 years ago, but it's recent enough that a number of the principals are still alive. Groff had the opportunity to meet Woodstock co-founder Michael Lang, whom he plays in the movie. Lang opened his memories to Groff and also visited the set. ""He came to the first day on set, and that was a little nerve-wracking, but it then became comforting because as we would be between takes he would, you know, be giving you a little thumbs-up,"" Groff recalled. ""I'm sure it must have been a little out-of-body. I mean, I can't imagine watching someone playing me in a movie, from 40 years earlier."" The 24-year-old Groff thinks Woodstock resonates today. ""Coming from my generation and looking back and seeing such innocence and seeing such passion and seeing such faith in each other, and the ability to come together and actually make something huge happen, is really inspiring,"" he said. Although there haven't been similar watershed events since, Schreiber and Groff said that the most similar event could be the 2008 election campaign, during which many young people rallied behind Barack Obama. ""Well, I gotta say that there is an air of optimism and potential in the election of Barack Obama,"" Schreiber said. ""I certainly feel a return to that sense of optimism and patriotism that I think people felt at perhaps the election of Kennedy and the beginning of the civil right's movement in America and the sexual revolution. ... It did feel somewhat timely."" The movie also tested Hirsch's and Schreiber personal boundaries: In addition to Schreiber's dress, Hirsch was naked for one scene. ""It wasn't just photographed. I was filmed!"" Hirsch said. ""What was fun about it is it was kind of like this liberating [situation], but that's what Woodstock was."" As for Schreiber, when his children saw him in a dress, they were ""terrified,"" and his partner, actress Naomi Watts, was ""pretty mortified."" ""I think that was sort of the point. I think the message is one of acceptance,"" Schreiber said. Scaring the kids is one thing, but what about wearing the dress on the set in front of the cast and crew? ""It was exhilaratingly humiliating,"" Schreiber said. ""I think that's generally how men feel when they put on dresses. That's why they do it so often.""

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China is shutting down a pair of smelting plants suspected of sickening several thousand children with lead poisoning, according to state-run media. A Chinese boy gets treated for blood poisoning in Shaanxi province Aug. 15. At least 851 children living near a plant in northwestern China's Shaanxi province were found to have excessive lead levels in their blood, according to the Xinhua news agency. The Dongling Lead and Zinc Smelting Co. would cease operations no later than Saturday, Xinhua reported Wednesday, citing local authorities. County officials had agreed to relocate residents who live within 1,640 feet (500 meters) of the Dongling Lead and Zinc Smelting Co. in three years, but the relocation is behind schedule, Sun Hong, the company's general manager, told Xinhua. The local government has pledged to speed up the relocation, Xinhua reported this month. A second smelter also was closed Wednesday in central China and two of its executives detained, a local official said, according to Xinhua, . Initial tests showed more than 1,300 children in the Hunan province town of Wenping have excessive lead in their blood from the Wugang Manganese Smelting Plant. A second round of testing has been ordered to confirm the results. The plant opened in May 2008 without gaining the approval of the local environment protection bureau, said Huang Wenbin, a deputy environment chief in Wugang City, Xinhua reported. The plant was within 500 meters (about a quarter mile) of three schools. The poisonings have occurred against the backdrop of China's rapid industrialization, which has produced economic success and wrought environmental havoc. Hundreds of millions of Chinese lack access to uncontaminated drinking water, and air pollution is blamed for myriad deaths and illnesses every year. Toxic air enshrouds cities across the country, one of the most polluted in the world. The government has stepped up anti-pollution efforts in recent years, but many companies flout such campaigns and laws.","A pair of plants suspected of sickening thousands of children is closed.

"(LifeWire)  -- Practicing the clarinet may be beyond tedious for teenagers forced into music lessons by their parents but for 70-year-old Joe Pedlosky it's a labor of love. Saxophonist Jerry Hendricks from Olympia, Washington, practices in Cambria, California, in March 2006 . ""From the time I was a little kid, I always wanted to play clarinet,"" says Pedlosky, a retired scientist in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. ""But we didn't have the money. Then ... I decided it was now or never."" Pedlosky, who plays with a local band, is one of many seniors picking up a musical instrument late in life. Many can thank New Horizons International Music Association, which sponsors senior bands and orchestras in the United States and Canada. The group was founded by Roy Ernst, professor emeritus at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. When he formed the first senior-only band in 1991, it was a radical notion. ""It was widely believed that the window of opportunity for learning music was childhood,"" Ernst says. ""If you didn't learn then, you missed your chance."" The senior bands prove otherwise. As a matter of fact, these novice musicians give new meaning to the conductor's command, ""Once more, with feeling."" ""I remember conducting at a senior band camp in California, and we played an arioso by Bach,"" recalls Ernst. ""The second time through, two people were crying, they were so touched by the music. ""High school kids could never do what we do, because they haven't lived enough, they haven't seen enough joy or sorrow. We have a special ability to play music expressively and with feeling."" Ernst, who sometimes refers to himself as the Johnny Appleseed of senior bands, made it his goal to bring seniors to music. From just one band in Rochester, New Horizons has grown to more than a hundred bands, plus offshoots from brass quintets to swing ensembles. Music for body and soul . Ernst's passion moved Professor Don Coffman of the University of Iowa to create his own senior band -- and to conduct research into how music can benefit older musicians. His findings: Benefits include social, emotional, physical and even spiritual growth. In part, Coffman found, seniors benefit from being part of a group that works together toward a significant goal. Other plusses can include better ability to focus, increased lung capacity and improved fine motor skills. Dinny Stamp would agree. She'd played trombone in high school; after retiring, she attended a performance of Coffman's Iowa City band and thought, ""I can do that!"" Playing in the band ""has been one of the most rewarding experiences of not only my retirement, but my life,"" says Stamp, who turns 78 this month. ""It's a joy to make wonderful music with new friends and to share this music with the community."" Judy Schroeder, 62, another member of the Iowa City band, took up the oboe about three months before retirement. ""I find that playing music really keeps your mind agile ... and our band director wants to challenge us to do well, think hard, try hard. It's just so much fun."" She's enjoying herself so much that she has taken up the bassoon as well. Getting started . If you're interested in getting involved with instrumental music, look for a band in your area on the New Horizons Web site. If there's no senior band available, or if you're interested in learning on your own, most teachers are willing to take on an older student. Pedlosky advises searching for the right kind of person so you're not quickly turned off. ""It's important, if you're going to start cold, to really find a good teacher -- someone who sets standards for you but is also mature enough to understand that it's unusual for an older person to take up something about which they know nothing."" There are real differences between younger and older learners. ""Adults are often more analytical about their learning and more persistent, so some display more rapid growth than would a 10-year-old beginner,"" Coffman explains. ""On the other hand, the physical demands of some instruments may lead to a plateauing effect for adults."" Some seniors, for example, may not be able to sustain high notes on a trumpet. Which instrument should you choose? If you've always had a passion for one instrument, Ernst says, go with your heart. But if you're not sure, ask for suggestions from the band director. ""If the group doesn't have a tuba player, you'd be quite the hero if you became one,"" he says. Who knows? You might even become a bit of a hero to yourself. ""Music is so demanding and compelling that once you start playing, everything else flies out the window,"" Pedlosky says. ""It gives you a deeper appreciation of music and musicians. And sometimes my music sounds really good to me, and that's wonderful.""

"(CNN) -- The commissioner of the Cambridge, Massachusetts, police department said Thursday he ""deeply regrets"" the arrest of prominent black Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., but stands by the procedures followed by his department. Sgt. Jim Crowley said he has nothing to apologize for in regards to the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr. ""I believe that Sgt. [James] Crowley acted in a way that is consistent with his training at the department, and consistent with national standards of law enforcement protocol,"" Commissioner Robert Haas said, referring to the officer who made the July 16 arrest at the professor's home. ""I do not believe his actions in any way were racially motivated,"" Haas said at a news conference. Gates was arrested for disorderly conduct after an exchange with the officer, who was investigating a report of a possible break-in at the house. The police department will create a panel of ""independent, notable professionals"" to provide an analysis of the incident, he said. The controversial arrest of Gates was criticized Wednesday by President Obama, who said the Cambridge police department ""acted stupidly."" ""My response is that this department is deeply pained and takes its professional pride very seriously,"" Haas said. Cambridge authorities dropped the charges against Gates on Tuesday. In a statement, the International Association of Chiefs of Police expressed disappointment in Obama's remarks. ""Police chiefs understand that it is critically important to have all the facts on any police matter before drawing conclusions or making any public statement,"" said Russell B. Laine, association president and chief of the Algonquin, Illinois, police department, in the statement. ""For these reasons, the IACP was disappointed in the president's characterization of the Cambridge Police Department."" Haas' comments followed a statement earlier Thursday from Crowley, who said he would not apologize for his actions. ""That apology will never come from me as Jim Crowley. It won't come from me as sergeant in the Cambridge Police Department,"" Crowley told Boston radio station WEEI. ""Whatever anybody else chooses to do in the name of the city of Cambridge or the Cambridge Police Department, which are beyond my control, I don't worry about that. I know what I did was right. I have nothing to apologize for."" The mayor of Cambridge said she will meet with the city's police chief to make sure the scenario that led to Gates' arrest does not happen again. ""This suggests that something happened that should not have happened,"" E. Denise Simmons, Cambridge's mayor said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""The situation is certainly unfortunate. This can't happen again in Cambridge."" Obama defended Gates Wednesday night, while acknowledging that he may be ""a little biased,"" because Gates is a friend. ""But I think it's fair to say, No. 1, any of us would be pretty angry; No. 2, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home; and, No. 3 ... that there's a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately."" The incident, Obama said, shows ""how race remains a factor in this society."" Crowley also said he is exercising caution and his previous actions clearly show he is not a racist. In fact, Crowley taught a racial profiling course at the Lowell Police Academy, said Deborah Friedl, deputy superintendent of the police department. Last year was his fifth year as a co-instructor of the course, Friedl said. ""He seems to be a highly regarded Â£instructor at the academy. He consistently received high praise from students,"" she said. Gates told CNN Wednesday that although charges had been dropped, he will keep the issue alive. ""This is not about me; this is about the vulnerability of black men in America,"" Gates told CNN's Soledad O'Brien. Gates said the Cambridge mayor had called him to apologize about the incident. Simmons, Cambridge's first black female mayor, confirmed to CNN that she apologized to Gates. Gates said he'd be prepared to forgive the arresting officer ""if he told the truth"" about what the director of Harvard's W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research said were ""fabrications"" in the police report. iReport.com: Join the conversation on racial profiling . Crowley wrote in the Cambridge police report that Gates refused to step outside to speak with him, and when Crowley told Gates that he was investigating a possible break-in, Gates opened the front door and exclaimed, ""Why, because I'm a black man in America?"" The report said Gates initially refused to show the officer identification, but eventually produced a Harvard identification card, prompting Crowley to radio for Harvard University Police. ""While I was led to believe that Gates was lawfully in the residence, I was quite surprised and confused with the behavior he exhibited toward me,"" Crowley said, according to the report. Gates was arrested for ""loud and tumultuous behavior in a public space"" and was released from police custody after spending four hours at the police station. He said Wednesday that he and his lawyers were considering further actions, not excluding a lawsuit. Gates said that although the ordeal had upset him, ""I would do the same thing exactly again.""","Officer: ""I know what I did was right. I have nothing to apologize for""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Watching the Dave Matthews Band moments before they take the stage is like watching a football team bursting out of the locker room before a big game. Dave Matthews says he bellieves strongly in the power of community. They slap hands. Bump fists. Jump up and down, exclaiming ""Feel the love, feel the love!"" The energy in the air is electric. And when they walk out on stage, the energy explodes into thousands of shining faces. People dance in the aisles. Others sing every word to every song. A few share funny cigarettes. For more than three hours, the jubilant atmosphere creates a sense of community between an amphitheater filled with strangers and the ethnically diverse musicians leading the charge on stage. But then DMB is all about community -- creating its own and giving back. BAMA Works Fund -- the group's charitable foundation -- has handed out $5 million in grants to worthy causes, including schools and victims of Hurricane Katrina.  Watch Matthews sound off on the album -- and racism Â» . And despite the unexpected passing of saxophonist LeRoi Moore due to complications from an ATV accident last summer, the band members seem to be recharged. In June, DMB notched its fifth consecutive No. 1 album on the Billboard chart with ""Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King."" We caught up with Matthews just as news hit the Web that former President Jimmy Carter believed racism was the root of some of the negativity directed toward President Obama in recent weeks. The 42-year-old singer-songwriter offered a unique perspective, as a man who split his childhood between the United States and South Africa during apartheid. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: President Carter said he thinks that a lot of the animosity directed toward President Obama is race related. Dave Matthews: Of course it is! I found there's a fairly blatant racism in America that's already there, and I don't think I noticed it when I lived here as a kid. But when I went back to South Africa, and then it's sort of thrust in your face, and then came back here -- I just see it everywhere. There's a good population of people in this country that are terrified of the president only because he's black, even if they don't say it. And I think a lot of them, behind closed doors, do say it. Maybe I'm paranoid about it, but I don't think someone who disagreed as strongly as they do with Obama -- if it was Clinton -- would have stood up and screamed at him during his speech. (Shakes his head) I don't think so. CNN: Everything has gone to such a frenzied pitch. Matthews: I think a lot of it has to be on the press. We give the podium to a lot of people who shouldn't have the podium. The message that's delivered the loudest and in the most entertaining way is the one that we're going to put on because that's what we want. We want ratings more than we want to deliver information. That's just where the culture's gotten. There's no way that Walter Cronkite, as a young journalist, no way Ed Murrow would be hired to do news today. Not a chance. CNN: Because they're too low-key? Because they're not bombastic? Matthews: Because they're thoughtful, and they're patient, and they're tying to tell you a truly balanced story. They're trying to impart information. I don't think that's the goal [now] because it's not a good business plan. ... Everyone's outraged all the time. Why are you outraged? There's war -- there's always been war, as long as most of us have been alive. There have always been people being abused, there's always been horrible things in the world. Why are we outraged? We should just be quiet and figure it out, and work it out together. ... There's no solution in Washington as long as people are shouting like that. CNN: Before you went on stage at the Greek Theatre (in Los Angeles), we were talking to the crew -- and they couldn't wait to tell us how well they're treated by the Dave Matthews organization. ... It's like your own minicommunity out there. You even print your own tickets, right? Matthews: We have kept everything in-house. The core crew guys are the same guys we had when we were driving in a van, so they can always call ""bull"" on us if we start acting like prima donnas. It keeps a sense of community going when you travel a lot. There's a good vibe. ... I have friends who are famous, and friends that are not famous -- but there are those who stick out to me. Willie Nelson is one -- a really genuine person -- or Neil Young. Adam Sandler ... people who really try and keep a sense of unity, and camaraderie and equality around them. That's essential. That's it for me. I don't think socialism, and I don't think warmness and respect are necessarily bad words. CNN: Do you think you're competitive? A perfectionist? Matthews: I'm a very vicious critic of myself. CNN: So what do you think of this record (""Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King"")? Matthews: I think that's a really good record. (Laugh) Our first three records were really good. We made good records after those first three -- really good records -- but I don't think they were necessarily the spirit of the band. I think this is the greatest record that we've ever made, and it captures the band like none of our records have. ... CNN: Before this album, weren't you burned out a little bit? Matthews: I insisted upon taking as much time to make this as I needed. And my manager would call -- my manager who I love, who's a dear friend of mine -- he'd call and say, ""Are you going to have it finished by the summer?"" ""No."" ""Are you going to have it finished by Christmas?"" ""No."" I practiced ""no."" I need to work on ""no"" still, but I got better at it. CNN: What other tricks do you have up your sleeve? Matthews: I want to figure out a way to not be stupid with money, then make a whole bunch of it, then I want to move to Outer Mongolia. I want to milk a yak. Maybe I'll just settle for a cow. Can you milk a bison? I have fantasies about being a farmer. I always wanted to be a fireman, but who didn't want to be a fireman? I just wouldn't tell anyone. I'd just go ""poof!"" Sometimes I like that idea. CNN: You don't tell people about a lot of things you do. There's no press release that goes out saying, ""Dave Matthews Band just donated $5 million to this cause or that cause."" Matthews: We definitely use our fame and our celebrity to raise money for things we care about. ... What a luxury to be able to just do a show, and then look -- pow! ... I don't want to become a poster child. That's a whole different thing. I don't want to be the face on it.","Dave Matthews: ""I just see [racism] everywhere""; not surprised at anger at Obama .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The National Archives -- a repository of important government documents, including the U.S. Constitution -- has lost a computer hard drive containing large volumes of Clinton administration records, including the names, phone numbers and Social Security numbers of White House staff members and visitors. The National Archives has lost a hard drive containing large volumes of Clinton administration records. Officials at the Archives say they don't know how many confidential records are on the hard drive. But congressional aides briefed on the matter say it contains ""more than 100,000"" Social Security numbers, including one belonging to a daughter of then-Vice President Al Gore. It also contains Secret Service and White House operating procedures, the staffers said they were told. The hard drive was last seen in the National Archive's complex in College Park, Maryland, sometime between October of last year and the first week of February. It was discovered missing in late March, prompting a thorough search for the small, 2.5 pound device, the Archives said. When it could not be located, the inspector general's office opened a criminal investigation. On Wednesday, the Archives announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to its return. The Archives said no national security information is on the hard drive, nor any original documents. But they said it does contain ""personally identifiable information,"" and they take the loss ""very seriously."" U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, whose staff was briefed on the matter, said the House will hold a hearing Thursday on the incident. ""If they [the National Archives' staff] can't handle a hard drive that may be sensitive properly, we need to ask the question, will they handle the most secret materials properly?"" Issa said. The Archives Wednesday gave the following account of the disappearance: . Last October, the hard drive was moved from a ""secure"" storage area to a workspace where it was being used for routine recopying to ensure preservation of the records. But work was halted last year because archivists ""wanted to investigate using automated tools to generate inspection reports."" Staffers were moved to other projects until an automated tool was found in mid-March -- that's when they found the hard drive was missing. The device is described as a two terabyte Western Digital MY BOOK external hard drive, measuring 6.5 x 2.1 x 5.4 inches. More than 110 4-millimeter tape cartridges were copied onto the hard drive. The records included records from the Clinton Administration Executive Office of the President.

"(CNN) -- Queen Latifah has been on the hip-hop scene for so long that she has seen artists come and go and trends change. Queen Latifah remains one of the few female rap artists who garner attention in the music industry. But there has been one development that she said has disappointed her tremendously -- the lack of female rap stars. ""There are not enough female rappers out there right now,"" she said. ""The voice of the female is not strong enough in the game at all right now. It's almost nonexistent."" While artists like Beyonce, Ciara and Rihanna have thrived in R&B and pop, high-profile success for female rap artists has been more elusive in recent years. From the beginning hip-hop has been viewed as a man's world, and discussions of sexism and inequality within the genre have come up often. In fact, many times such disrespect was the subject of the female rappers' tracks. Today, with the music industry struggling, there is a particular dearth of female rap artists taking center stage. It was a different hip-hop landscape when Queen Latifah first burst on the scene in the late 1980s. The all-female rap crew Salt-N-Pepa (whose DJ was also a woman) scored some hits. The arrival of Queen Latifah helped usher in artists such as Monie Love. Rapper MC Lyte was a teenager when she emerged, along with Queen Latifah, as one of the genre's first female superstars.  Check out some of the more successful female hip-hop artists Â» . MC Lyte said the music industry is so focused these days on the bottom line  that there is little emphasis on cultivating female talent. ""When you have this major business that has been kind of taken over by corporate hands, it's like, how necessary is the black woman's perspective?"" she said. ""Not unless she is talking about being that kingpin's main girl and she's wearing next to nothing and she's talking about nothing that is really going to nurture the people the way we are known innately as black women being able to do, there's really no space for that type."" Alonzo Williams agrees. A founding member of the West Coast rap group the World Class Wrecking Crew, which also featured Dr. Dre of the group N.W.A., Williams said many female rappers are finding it hard to navigate today's industry. ""It's a lot of women trying to get into it, but most young women don't know what direction to take,"" Williams said. ""They don't know whether to be a gun moll for a gangster or a mother and they are confused as to what role they should take."" Artists like Queen Latifah and MC Lyte have served as role models to rappers that came after them, Williams said. Having successful women in the industry also allowed for the rise of artists like Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown, who express their sexuality with hardcore lyrics. But all of the dialogue about misogyny in rap, coupled with music executives' hesitancy to spend money grooming new artists, has left some female rappers floundering, he said. ""It can be hard for women to find an image that is street-marketable as well as radio-marketable,"" Williams said. ""For the most part, men can get away with a whole lot more because of the double standard that exists among the sexes, and so it's difficult for women to find a niche."" Not that the talent isn't out there. MC Lyte said she has encountered several accomplished female lyricists on the Internet and through her work with Hip Hop Sisters, a network she founded. And to help women gain more exposure in the industry, Queen Latifah is going to the grass roots, as she returns to her musical roots. Her new album, ""Persona,"" marks her return to rap after having focused on her singing career for the past few years. Latifah, along with CoverGirl, for which she serves as a spokesperson, is sponsoring a contest titled ""Ignite Your Persona."" Contestants can submit brief videos of themselves rapping, singing, dancing and/or performing as well as a short essay. A finalist from each city along her tour will be selected to open for her, Queen Latifah said. ""Hopefully I will be able to discover some new talent that I can bring to the forefront,"" she said. ""I feel like I have been so fortunate with hip-hop providing a door for the many opportunities I have had, and I want to give that to other women. Because when there are not enough females [in the industry], the balance is off.""","Female rappers finding it difficult to break through in music industry .

"(CNN) -- Legendary American boxer Muhammad Ali has visited the birthplace of his ancestors in Ireland, prompting thousands of well-wishers to line the streets of the town. Muhammad Ali on a nine-day visit to Europe that included a stopover to his ancestral home in Ireland. The scenes were reminiscent of a presidential visit as the 67-year-old former three-times world heavyweight champion traveled to Ennis, County Clare to see the hometown of his forebear. The visit was commemorated by the town council with the unveiling of a plaque at the home of his great-grandfather and by making Ali the first honorary ""freeman"" of the town. Abe Grady -- the grandfather of Ali's mother Odessa Lee Grady -- lived in the town of Ennis,  before emigrating to the United States in 1860 where he married an African-American emancipated slave.  Watch as Muhammad Ali visits Ireland Â» . Ali -- who was crowned Sportsman of the Century by Sports Illustrated in 1999 -- had his Irish heritage uncovered by genealogists in 2002. ""Now that we know Muhammad is an Ennis man, we will be back,"" Ali's wife Lonnie told Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper. The small County Clare town of 23 thousand put on an open-air concert, closed schools early and had special screenings of the Ali versus George Foreman documentary ""When We Were Kings"" to welcome the ""Louisville Lip."" Ali -- who has been a Parkinson's Disease sufferer since 1984 -- did not speak to those who had gathered but shadow-boxed to spectators and cameras before meeting his distant relatives. ""It was incredible. We've had so much rain, and yet today it was beautiful. The rain held off wherever Muhammad Ali went,"" Frankie Neylon, the town's mayor said. Ali fought in Ireland only once during his career, beating Al Blue Lewis in a non-title bout at Dublin's Croke Park in 1972. The visit to Ireland was part of a nine-day tour of Europe that Ali had undertaken to raise money to fight Parkinson's Disease and for the Ali Center.","Muhammad Ali visits his ancestral home of Ennis, Ireland .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Like all zombie movies, ""Zombieland"" has hundreds of zombies doing awful things, such as attacking and eating humans, but you could argue it's not a zombie movie. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson find themselves battling the undead in ""Zombieland."" Zombie hordes do chase the main characters in a post-apocalyptic world, but the focus is on the comedy's stars, including two Oscar nominees -- Woody Harrelson and Abigail Breslin -- along with Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone. (Spoiler alert: A third Oscar nominee makes a remarkable cameo appearance, but this story will avoid spoiling the surprise by naming him.) ""We wanted to make a cool, kick-ass road movie about a dysfunctional family traveling across the country and zombies provide us the antagonists, the threat that our characters need to come together,"" said Paul Wernick, who wrote the screenplay with partner Rhett Reese. In fact, Wernick had only seen one zombie film before writing this script. Reese, who is a fan of the genre, kept the story on a track that would feed zombie fans' hunger for blood-and-guts action. ""[The] zombie genre is so well traveled, there is really no reason to get into it unless we could do it in a fresh, different way,"" Reese said. ""We were almost forced to think outside the box to make it an entertaining zombie movie."" ""Zombieland"" is set in the United States months after a fast-moving virus begins turning most people into flesh-eating zombies. A handful of survivors come together to fight back. Wernick and Reese literally rewrote the rules for zombie films in this movie. Eisenberg's character is an obsessive-compulsive man who developed 47 rules -- such as ""fasten your seat belt"" -- designed to help him survive in Zombieland. While Eisenberg journeys to find his parents, he joins Harrelson, a zombie killer who is searching for the last Hostess Twinkie before its expiration date. Stone and Breslin play sisters who survive on their con artist skills. Their goal is to reach a California amusement park, which they think could be free of zombies. The cross-country trip these four characters share resembles ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" -- if written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.  Watch the stars of the film talk about zombie fans Â» . Wernick said they wanted to be ""very freewheeling."" The movie ""gives the audience the thrill of the journey,"" he said. ""We wanted to take some wild turns."" ""The rules that we lived by when writing this is in fact that there are no rules,"" he said. ""Zombieland"" may be to zombies what Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" is to Nazis. Wernick and Reese, who have been close friends since high school, often finish each other's sentences as if they were an old married couple. ""When we were trying to get 'Zombieland' off the ground back in the early days, we ..."" Wernick said. ""... assaulted Tarantino at an awards show, to try to get him to read the script,"" Reese said. ""That didn't work out,"" Wernick said in conclusion to their joint thought. ""He thought we were zombies coming after him."" ""Zombieland,"" directed by Rubin Fleischer, offers many of the same elements as a Tarantino film. ""[Tarantino] is all about dialogue, character, irreverence, pop culture and we love all those things over the years,"" Reese said. ""We have always been inspired by him."" The writers had to run through a number of actors before finding the person for the 10-minute cameo. Among them was Patrick Swayze, the writers' first choice. Swayze, who died just two weeks before the movie's release, turned down the role because of ill health earlier this year. Also asked: Joe Pesci, Steven Seagal, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Matthew McConaughey, Mark Hamill, Kevin Bacon and Sylvester Stallone. They were asked, but either didn't want the role or were not available, according to Wernick and Reese. With just a few days before filming the scenes, they asked Harrelson to look in his cell phone for names and numbers. He came up with a man who's been an Oscar nominee and Emmy winner. And now, he's got a key role in a zombie film.","In new movie ""Zombieland,"" focus is on the stars and the comedy .

"(CNN) -- The father of Haleigh Cummings, a Florida girl who disappeared in February, plans to file for divorce from the girl's stepmother, a key witness in the case, his attorneys told HLN's ""Nancy Grace."" Ronald Cummings plans to divorce his wife, Misty, his attorney says. The move follows weeks of reported tension between Ronald and Misty Cummings during the search for Haleigh, who was 5 when last seen. In papers expected to be filed Tuesday, Ronald Cummings, 25, cites irreconcilable differences in ending his short marriage to his 17-year-old wife, said Terry Shoemaker, Ronald Cummings' attorney. Haleigh went missing from her father's home in Satsuma, Florida, on February 9. Cummings has made several public pleas for information in her disappearance. Misty Cummings, then known as Misty Croslin, was the last person known to have seen Haleigh the night she disappeared from the family's rented mobile home. The teenager said she tucked Haleigh and her 4-year-old brother into bed about 8 p.m. and went to sleep herself two hours later, but awoke at 3 a.m. to find the girl missing and a cinder block propping open a back door. Ronald Cummings called police and reported his daughter missing when he returned from work at dawn. Investigators have said they do not feel Misty Cummings has told them everything she knows. ""The police have been telling me that I've been keeping Misty under my wing and that's why she hasn't talked to the cops,"" Ronald Cummings told a ""Nancy Grace"" producer Tuesday. ""So now, here you go, I divorced her. So now go find my baby.""  Watch Ronald Cummings speak to Nancy Grace Â» . The Putnam County Sheriff's office said in August that ""the evidence and investigatory effort has minimized the likelihood that Haleigh's disappearance is the work of a stranger."" Ronald Cummings and Crystal Sheffield, Haleigh's mother, are not considered suspects, police said. ""Investigators believe that Misty Croslin-Cummings continues to hold important answers in the case,"" the sheriff's office said in a written statement. ""She has failed to provide any sort of detailed accounting of the hours during the late evening and early morning of Haleigh's disappearance. Furthermore, physical evidence at the scene contradicts Misty's sketchy account of her evening activities."" Shoemaker said his client told Misty Cummings he wanted a divorce on Sunday, and that the a divorce agreement was drawn up Monday. The agreement was sent to Misty Cummings' lawyer for her signature. ""He really didn't come to us and say, 'I want to file for divorce,'"" said another of Ronald Cummings' attorneys, Brandon Beardsley. ""My understanding is that this is something that he and Misty have been discussing for the last few days and they're contemplating it because they ultimately feel that it is in the best interest for both of them."" Misty Cummings' attorney, Robert Fields, told CNN he has not talked with his client and doesn't know her thoughts regarding the divorce. Fields said he had received the papers via e-mail but had not had a chance to review them. Asked what he thought the divorce would mean for the search for Haleigh, he said, ""Probably nothing."" ""You have to understand that ever since Haleigh went missing, they have been scrutinized,"" Beardsley said of the Cummingses. ""They can't go out to dinner, can't even go to the convenience store to get a drink. ... The pressure of everything that is going on, the allegations and speculation, has been a stress on the relationship. The two lived together for about six months before marrying in March. The divorce agreement provides no financial terms, according to Shoemaker. On Monday, Misty Cummings left Satsuma to stay with a friend in Orlando, 50 miles south, Shoemaker said.","Haleigh Cummings' father plans to file for divorce from the girl's stepmother .

"(CNN)  -- People who go to Daytona Beach, Florida, by car this weekend will probably wish they hadn't -- they'll definitely stand out in a crowd. Bobby Mitchell, left, and Sheila Justin enjoy Bike Week in Daytona Beach, Florida. The city is being taken over by half a million motorcycle enthusiasts enjoying Bike Week, which began Friday and will end Sunday. The economy may be in a recession, but bikers aren't passing up the chance to soak up some sun and rev up their engines for a few days in Florida for the biggest motorcycle event in the country. ""Every indication we've had so far is that this year's going to be a good one,"" said Kevin Kilian, senior vice president of the Daytona Beach/Halifax Area Chamber of Commerce. The chamber is the managing arm of the city's involvement in Bike Week, a 10-day event that Kilian said takes an entire year to prepare for. Events like Bike Week and its little brother, Biketoberfest, are what keep Daytona Beach running, Kilian said. With 8.5 million visitors each year, special events bring in about $1.3 billion. The two biker events alone generate $650 million of that, he said. The festival didn't always pack in a half-million people, though. In 1988, said Paul Crow, the Daytona Beach police chief at the time, the event had morphed into something very different from what it was when it started. He said he had to battle what he called ""the 1 percent problem"" -- the small group of gangs whose viciousness and threats against outsiders had allowed them to take over Bike Week. He decided he wouldn't have any more of their troublemaking, Crow said, so he created a task force that evolved into the office of special investigations for the Daytona Beach Police. Its specific purpose was to deal with the problem. Today, Bike Week has been restored as family-friendly event. The event has even drawn in other nearby Central Florida communities -- including Ormond Beach in the north and Port Orange and New Smyrna in the south -- giving bikers more events to attend and places to go. Bike Week caters to a wide demographic of people. ""These are people with a lot of disposable income,"" Kilian said. ""They can afford a $30,000 toy."" Factors like the economy and this year's long hard winter probably got people more excited about Bike Week because it's a chance to get away, he said. ""Everybody needs a break."" Ken Logan, 50, a radio producer from Orlando, Florida, has been going to Bike Week for four years. He said he goes to ""keep updated on motorcycle stuff as far as styles, what's done to them, meet people who enjoy bikes, to get patches and all the toy stuff, so to speak, and enjoy other people who enjoy the same thing."" The ride from Orlando is only 35 minutes, and he said that's half the fun. ""Everybody should go -- whether you have a bike or not -- at least once, just to take it in and see what it's about,"" Logan said. Bobby Mitchell, 52, also a radio producer in Orlando, grew up in Daytona Beach and has been going to Bike Week his entire life. He said it's been more fun in recent years, though. ""It's more fun when you actually have a motorcycle,"" he said. ""You get out there and ride alongside people. You're part of the roar, the noise."" Not only is Bike Week becoming more family-friendly, but it's more diverse as well, with more women participants, said Kathleen Tolleson, president and CEO of Roar Motorcycles. There's even a ""sisterhood bikeride"" in which 35 to 50 women ride together. Daytona Beach-based Roar Motorcycles specifically markets accessories and motorcycles for women. This year, Tolleson said, the company is unveiling a new motorcycle designed by women and made specifically for women and their needs. ""It's becoming more culturally acceptable, so more and more women are riding."" she said. The bike has a lower seat so that a woman can use her legs and hips when picking the bike off the stand, and can put her feet firmly on the ground when stopped. Most bikes are designed for men, who have more upper body strength and longer limbs. ""Women,"" she said, ""need a lower center of gravity."" The company is taking orders now, and the bikes will be available in six to nine months.","Bike Week in Daytona Beach, Florida, began Friday and ends Sunday .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Michael Jackson fans will get their first peek at the behind-the-scenes documentary of the pop star's final three months Sunday evening during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, MTV said. Michael Jackson died in June at the age of 50, amid preparations for his This Is It tour. Janet Jackson ""will help open the entire show to honor Michael's celebrated career,"" the network said. No other details about her ""special appearance"" were released. The debut of the trailer for ""Michael Jackson's This Is It"" will come about four weeks after concert promoter AEG Live handed over to Sony Pictures about 100 hours of video captured between April and June, when Jackson was preparing for his concert comeback. Fans who miss the MTV show, which will air live at 9 p.m. ET Sunday, can preview the documentary at www.thisisit-movie.com beginning Sunday night, the network said. The trailer makes its big screen debut September 18 with the Sony Pictures Animation release of ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs.""

""Audiences will be given a privileged and private look at the singer, dancer, filmmaker, architect and genius as he creates and perfects his final show,"" Sony said. Kenny Ortega, who was working with Jackson to create the This Is It concert, is also directing the documentary. ""As we began assembling the footage for the motion picture, we realized we captured something extraordinary, unique and very special,"" Ortega said. ""It's a very private, exclusive look into a creative genius's world."" Ortega said Jackson's This Is It ""may go down as the greatest concert that no one got a chance to see,"" as the pop singer died June 25, three weeks before it was to debut in London, England's O2 Arena.

"WESTERN DESERT, Iraq (CNN) -- The hot wind swirls around the human bones and cracked skulls that litter the forsaken desert lands in Western Iraq. The entrance to the bunker complex where al Qaeda terrorized enemies in Iraq. We are standing in the middle of what was an al Qaeda execution site, just outside an intricate bunker complex that the organization used to torture and murder its victims, the bodies left to rot or be eaten by animals. From the back of the police truck the opening to the first bunker is barely discernible in the distance. ""Al Qaeda came in as a massive force"" one of the officers says as we bump along the harsh terrain. ""They stole our cars, our personal cars. They kidnapped two of my brothers. They blew up the house over there."" In the distance we can see his village -- a set of sand colored homes surrounded by parched farmlands. As we approach grubby children chase the truck and then stand to the side, despondent, as the officer points to their home. ""Their father was killed by al Qaeda,"" he says. In 2007 the U.S. military launched a series of airstrikes that drove out al Qaeda. As we enter the first bunker Captain Khaled Bandar tells us they found the floor littered with bodies. A gaping hole is evidence of the U.S. firepower. Insurgents used the layered and intricate labyrinth of passageways and hatches to carry out summary trials and executions. The police show us clothing and shoes, saying they are leaving them in place in case the families of the victims decide to come back. The stench of decay still lingers. Al Qaeda has been on the defensive in recent years, notwithstanding spectacular attacks attributed to the group like last week's blasts in the capital, including suicide truck bomb attacks on the ministries of foreign affairs and finance.  At least 100 people were killed and more than 500 wounded. But the concerted security campaign against the group has forced it to change its structure and strategy. According to one man who has close connections to al Qaeda in Iraq and asked not to be identified, the group lost support because it lost the protection of the people. ""There is an old saying about the basics of war. Whoever wins the people wins the war. So when al Qaeda didn't win the people over, it lost its battles,"" he explains. ""Al Qaeda's strategy of taking control of areas has been abandoned for now. Their method is propaganda, instilling fear, terrorizing."" He adds that the group stopped recruiting over the last six months because of a shortage in funding and increased infiltration. ""Al Qaeda is moving towards selecting the elite and condensing its forces rather than expanding. The Americans nearly defeated al Qaeda by cornering it and reducing its operations,"" he says. But those operations are still deadly, and the war is by no means over. ""No, the war is not over in Iraq, a type of battle is over, but there are new battles cloaked in politics. Now politicians try to pay militias, al Qaeda, or armed factions ...in order to eliminate political foes,"" the man with knowledge of al Qaeda says. And al Qaeda is still able to send a message to those who dare oppose them. The police officers show us blood stains in the desert near the bunkers and tell us how they found two beheaded bodies just a month ago. They were identified as being the brothers of two police officers from another city, Ramadi. Meanwhile, al Qaeda's global war has sifted to a place it believes it can still win -- Afghanistan. ""Al Qaeda in Afghanistan is made up of true believers, those who believe in jihad and fighting, and that's why they joined,"" the man with connections says. ""As for most of al Qaeda in Iraq's members, they are just looking to benefit themselves, or they join out of resentment for a certain sect or to avenge their families."" As for Iraq's longterm stability, that very much still hangs in the balance. He says: ""Peace will not be achieved by a magic wand or the rhetoric of a politician. Peace will be accomplished through the will of the Iraqi youth. We have to wait for this generation to change ... so that a generation that hates (the violence) will emerge.""

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea fired several short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan on Saturday, an act that the U.S. watched closely and South Korea called provocative. N. Korean army soldiers, back, look at a S. Korean soldier, center, in the demilitarized zone in June. Pyongyang fired six short-range missiles in less than seven hours, South Korea's Foreign Ministry said. The missiles were apparently Scud-type, estimated to have a range of about 500 kilometers (310 miles), according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. South Korean intelligence estimates that North Korea has about 700 such missiles in its arsenal. Pyongyang test-fired four such missiles off the east coast Thursday, Yonhap reported. South Korea called the launches a provocative act, according to a government statement. North Korea had issued a warning to mariners to avoid an area in the Sea of Japan at certain times between June 24 and July 9 because of a ""military firing exercise,"" according to a U.S. military communication about the warning provided to CNN. The recent firings come amid heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula. North Korea conducted a nuclear test in May, fired test rockets and threatened U.S. and South Korean ships near its territorial waters.  Watch S. Korea confirm firing of missiles Â» . The first two missiles were fired about 8 a.m. and 8:30 a.m., Yonhap reported. Another missile was launched about 10:45 a.m., the agency reported. A fourth one came some time after that. The U.S. Navy and other U.S. officials said they are ready to track any missiles. ""The United States is aware of possible missile launches by North Korea. We are closely monitoring North Korea's activities and intentions,"" a U.S. official said. ""This type of North Korea behavior is not helpful. What North Korea needs to do is fulfill its international obligations and commitments.""

""It is worrisome to some degree, but it is different from a ballistic missile launch,"" said Pinkston, of the International Crisis Group in Seoul, South Korea. ""It's part of military training, but there seem to be no movements of troops or anything that would suggest preparations for military operations. ""So yes, people are watching it, the military is watching it here, but I don't think it's related to any plans or operations to attack anyone.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The world's largest, fastest fully solar-powered boat is being built in preparation for a round-the-world challenge. 'Planet Solar' would be the world's fastest fully solar-powered boat and is projected to cross the Atlantic in two weeks. The futuristic-looking ""Planet Solar,"" which is 100 percent powered by sunlight, is the brainchild of Swiss engineer Raphael Domjan, a former paramedic with a passion for innovative design and renewable energies. The 30-meter vessel is currently being built in Kiel, Germany, and will be finished early next year. If all goes according to plan, the boat will begin sailing summer 2010 -- first in European waters and then around the world. The boat can travel at up to 14 knots (26k/m) and would be the first solar-powered boat to travel at such high speeds. It is projected to be able to cross the Atlantic in just two weeks. Domjan hopes his ambitious, $11.5 million (â¬8 million) project will prove that boats can travel at high speeds without emitting any carbon dioxide. ""[I] want to show that we can change, that solutions exist and that it's not too late,"" Domjan writes on his Web site. ""Using technology and our knowledge to better promote renewable energies is the way towards a lasting world."" Planet Solar will be covered in 470 square meters of solar panels -- the equivalent of two tennis courts. This means it will have particularly high energy absorption.  See more images of the solar-powered boat Â» . Twenty-three percent of absorbed sunlight will be converted into energy that the boat can run on, compared with 17 percent for average panels, according to Planet Solar's project manager, Danny Faigaux of Grand Chelem Management. ""The first man sailed around the world 500 years ago and Raphael thought it was about time we did it in a different way,"" Faigaux told CNN. But relying purely on solar energy may prove difficult in areas of the world where bad weather prevents sunlight from penetrating the clouds. Batteries on Planet Solar will be able to store enough energy gathered from the sun to allow the boat to sail in poor conditions for three days, said Faigaux. If cloudy weather persists for more than three days, the vessel will run into real difficulties. To avoid this eventuality, the team has partnered with the French meteorological institute, ""Meteo France."" The institute will update Planet Solar's skippers on which routes to avoid. Famous French sailor Gerard D'Abouville will skipper the boat alongside Domjan. D'Abouville is the first man to have rowed across both the Atlantic and the Pacific and has long been involved with sustainable development. In April 2011 after a short tour of Europe, Planet Solar will embark on a round-the-world tour, stopping in dozens of cities along the way. Wherever the boat goes, Domjan hopes to teach people about alternative ways of consuming energy. At each port-of-call he plans to set up a portable ""educational village"" made from inflatable material. Up to 500 people at any one time will be will be able to visit the village's three inflatable ""spheres"" to learn more about Planet Solar, ecology and economy. ""This situation is also an opportunity,"" said Domjan. ""The dilution of our resources and fossil fuels and climate change forces us to rethink our societies.""","World's largest, fastest fully solar-powered boat is attempting round-the-world tour .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Edwin Salau knew coming back would be hard. But he had to do it. The retired U.S. Army first lieutenant needed to know that his sacrifice was worth it. Retired Army 1st Lt. Edwin Salau says he sees progress in Iraq since he left five years ago. ""I wanted to make sure I didn't bleed in vain for the Iraqi people,"" Salau said. ""And what I found is I did not. I see the progress over five years. I see free Iraqis doing what Iraqis want to do in their country, and I see the U.S. taking a back seat."" Salau left the battlefield in November 2004, after being hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and small-arms fire during an ambush close to the town of Tuz. Those injuries cost him most of his left leg; it was amputated above the knee and he now wears a prosthesis. Recently, he and seven other wounded American veterans returned to Iraq so they could heal emotionally. It was part of a nonprofit pilot program called Operation Proper Exit, an initiative started a little over a year ago by the Troops First Foundation, based in Maryland. The USO supports the mission.  Watch Salau describe his feelings on returning Â» . Rick Kell, head of Troops First, traveled to Iraq with the soldiers and said the idea came from American troops. ""After spending much time at Walter Reed and Brooke Army medical centers, inevitably in any conversation, something reminds somebody that they want to go back. And the soldiers don't hesitate to tell you that,"" Kell said. ""They are soldiers and they want to come back primarily for several reasons, but they want to come back and let the troops here on the ground know that they are still part of them, they support them, and they would very much like to be with them, although they can't."" It's an emotional journey for the returning veterans, a chance to visit bases where they were stationed, and, in some cases, the sites where they were wounded. Though other programs have allowed wounded American soldiers to return to the scene of their service and sacrifice, this is the first to allow them to do so while a war is still being waged. All in all, 13 soldiers have participated in the program so far -- eight this trip and five on a previous trip, which took place in June. The earlier trip was kept quiet because of fears that the experience would be too overwhelming for the participants. According to Kell, he encounters many soldiers who would like to return, but those who are selected are chosen carefully. ""Well, first of all, when we come in contact with someone who wants to come back -- and that's somebody who is thriving, that is mentally and physically moving forward in their life, they've demonstrated that they have a plan for what's next and they've begun to implement that plan,"" he said. ""So we feel pretty good about this person being squared away. And there are concerns, but it's a very personal decision. We only ask for one of three answers: yes, no or not now."" Salau, who now works with other wounded soldiers at Camp Lejeune, in North Carolina, thinks he's become an ambassador for them. When Salau departed Iraq the first time, he couldn't do it on his own. That's why this trip was so important to him. ""My purpose for this trip was for my soldiers to have that last memory of me in Iraq walking out of here on my own power,"" he said. ""And I achieved that and it was closure."" Salau and Kell think the program has been a success so far. According to them, the main reason for that is the support they've gotten from the military command in Iraq, particularly Gen. Raymond Odierno, the top U.S. commander there. Odierno's experiences with his son, who lost his arm in Iraq, helped the general better understand these soldiers' plight, Kell said. ""He has insight and perspective that a lot of leaders don't, thank goodness,"" Kell said, calling Odierno a very compassionate man. ""Gen. Odierno is ... he's a soldier's general,"" Salau said. ""He understands. It was clear when I met him the first day of our trip that he knew what the results would be at the end of our trip. I thank them for letting us come back."" Whether the program will help the wounded soldiers psychologically has yet to be proven. Also in question is whether more soldiers will be able to participate. Troops First would like to include as many soldiers as possible, Kell said, but U.S. troops will not be in Iraq for much longer. ""We've got a short window,"" he said. ""We've got a formula down. We can only do six to eight on each trip, so we can make it a very personal experience and have it be meaningful."" For Salau, it was extremely meaningful. Now he can go home on his own terms. ""Today, I packed my stuff and I dressed in a uniform ... and then I'm going to undress at home and not Walter Reed,"" he said. ""That feeling, it can't completely be put into words. I'm gonna get greeted at the airport by my wife and children. I'm not gonna be greeted at Walter Reed. And I'm gonna keep on living the dream.""","Eight wounded U.S. veterans return to Iraq through ""Operation Proper Exit"" program .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Heavy rains triggered by El Nino weather patterns could potentially prove devastating for east African nations that have been water-starved for months, the United Nations has warned. A Turkana boy holds an empty cup in a village in northwestern Kenya. Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania and Uganda are facing mudslides, crop destruction, waterborne diseases and disrupted road networks, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Friday. Djibouti, Eritrea and Ethiopia could also be affected. The effects of flooding are expected to be exacerbated because so much greenery has disappeared in the drought. ""More than 23 million people in pastoral, agricultural and suburban communities, as well as internally displaced people and refugees in the region, are reeling from the impact of water and food shortages, pasture scarcity, conflict and insecurity,"" said John Holmes, the under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs who is coordinating emergency relief operations. ""While we cannot prevent these climatic shocks, we certainly can mitigate their disastrous effects through forward planning and the right funding from the donor community,"" he said. Uganda, hit by El Nino a decade ago, is planning to apply some of the lessons learned this time around, said Fred Opolot, a government spokesman. ""The government has allocated funds and resources to areas that will be affected,"" he said. ""Our disaster preparedness department is using press briefings, among other ways, to inform the public."" Though the department is not very well-funded, he said, the government is working with groups such as the United Nations and international aid agencies to prepare for floods. ""It is a multifaceted effort ... we want to ensure citizens are sensitized to the dangers of El Nino and things such as bridges are in good condition."" The rainy season begins in the Horn of Africa in mid-October and runs through the end of the year. Meteorologists have forecasted that this year's rains will be more intense than usual because of the El Nino phenomenon, caused by a rise in temperature in the Pacific and Indian oceans. Aid agencies are already buckling under the weight of helping millions of people who have suffered through months of failed crops, drought and erratic rains caused by climate change. In Somalia, 450,000 people in the Juba and Shabelle river basins could suffer, the United Nations estimates. In neighboring Kenya, some 750,000 people -- 150,000 of whom are refugees -- could be affected. The Turkana, a pastoral tribe in northeastern Kenya, is already reeling from a severe drought that has left scores of people dead and remains of skeletal cows strewn across the flat, arid land. The remote region has no access to resources, making it especially vulnerable to natural disasters such as floods. CNN's Moni Basu and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.","U.N. humanitarian agency: East African nations facing flooding, mudslides .

"(CNN) -- The Australian cruiser met the disguised German vessel in the waters off western Australia two years after the two became enemies in World War II. The gun turret of the Sydney II was discovered with the rest of the vessel in March 2008. The Australian ship approached, trying to determine whether the vessel was friendly. It wasn't. What resulted was Australia's worst naval disaster: the sinking of the Australian ship and the loss of its entire crew of 645. The wreckage wasn't found until last year, leading to decades of conspiracy theories about what actually happened. On Wednesday a long-awaited report on the sinking of the Sydney II ended the mystery that began when it met its fate, November 19, 1941. Made to look like a cargo ship, the German vessel was in fact a military raider that fired on the Australians when they got close. The Sydney fired back and, in the end, both ships went down. More than 300 of the sailors on board the German vessel, the Kormoran, survived. But because they were the only witnesses to the disaster, some doubted their accounts, leading to various theories about the real fate of the Sydney. After the wrecks of both ships were located in March 2008, an Australian commission began an inquiry to formally close the book on the loss of the Sydney. The results confirm the accounts provided by the German sailors. They said the Sydney closed in on the Kormoran until it was parallel with the German ship, little more than 1,000 yards away. ""Sydney obviously thought the ship was friendly and was taken by surprise when, after she asked what she believed to be (a friendly ship) to give her secret call sign, the response was a number of salvos that destroyed Sydney's bridge and amidships superstructure and a torpedo strike that crippled the ship and her forward guns,"" the report said. The Sydney had given up its tactical advantage of speed and armaments by getting so close to an unknown vessel, the report said. While that may have been an error of judgment by the Australian captain, Joseph Burnett, the report accepted that other factors -- which may never be known -- influenced his decision. ""It can never be known what matters were, in fact, operating in Capt. Burnett's mind when he decided to take the Sydney to the position described. Nor can it be known what advice, if any, he sought from or was given by other officers on the bridge,"" the report says. ""What is known, however, is that, in trying to identify the sighted ship, Capt. Burnett was performing his duty as a commanding officer."" The German ship inflicted ""enormous damage"" on the Sydney during a battle that is believed to have lasted about 35 minutes and left 70 percent of the Sydney's crew dead or incapacitated, said Cmdr. Jack Rush, the lawyer who presented the evidence gathered by investigators to a commission of inquiry led by a retired judge. It is likely that Burnett, the navigator, and all of the Sydney's senior officers were taken out on the first salvo, Rush said. A torpedo tore into the Sydney's bow, flooding the forward end of the ship, while the Kormoran fired an estimated 87 rounds from its 15-cm (5.9-inch) guns into the Australian cruiser. The Sydney limped away and sank sometime between 2 hours to 4 1/2 hours later, Rush said. During the battle, however, the Kormoran itself was hit by an Australian shell that damaged its engines and set the vessel ablaze. With hundreds of mines aboard, its captain ordered the crew to abandon ship, fearing the fire would set those off. Charges were set and the ship was scuttled. About 80 of the Kormoran's crew of nearly 400 were lost. A search began only five days after the battle, when the Sydney failed to return to port in Fremantle. And an 11-day delay by Australia's government in announcing the ship's loss fueled what a 1999 parliamentary report called ""a proliferation of theories"" about the fate of the crew -- that the ship was actually sunk by a Japanese submarine, that survivors were machine-gunned in the water or that the government hid bodies after they washed up on the beach. The commission thoroughly investigated all the theories and speculations surrounding the disaster and found no substance in any of them, said Terence Cole, president of the commission. Researchers found the Sydney's wreckage in the Indian Ocean, about 207 km (128 miles) off Australia's west coast. The commission was appointed in May 2008 and began its inquiry in January. ""For a long time our nation has struggled to understand how our greatest maritime disaster occurred. The unanswered questions have haunted the families of those brave sailors and airman that never came home,"" Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, the chief of the Australian Defence Force, said in a written statement.","Finding: Sydney's captain, senior officers likely to have died in first salvo .

"Washington (CNN) -- A former U.S. government scientist who served in sensitive positions on classified aerospace projects pleaded not guilty to attempted espionage Thursday. He will be held without bond pending a jury trial. Stewart David Nozette, 52, appeared in U.S. District Court wearing a prison uniform with bold, horizontal black and white stripes. He smiled as his defense attorney greeted him, and he seemed relaxed during the proceeding. In arguing against bond, prosecutors played what they call an undercover videotape of a conversation just 10 days ago between Nozette and an agent. Nozette, sitting back in a chair or sofa at what appears to be a hotel room, is heard negotiating for a false passport and a means to get to a country with no extradition policy with the United States. ""I like the idea of an invisible identity,"" Nozette was heard saying in the recording. ""Can you actually get me that, that artificial name and stuff?"" He discussed gift cards under an alias, and a ""kitty"" that he could use for expenses. Prosecutors Thursday initially said they would present a witness to authenticate the videotape. But the judge accepted the government's claim and a transcript and allowed the eight-minute recording to be played. Authorities have said in a criminal complaint that Nozette, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, tried to deliver classified information to someone he thought was an Israeli intelligence official but who was actually an FBI undercover agent. Nozette, responding on the videotape to the agent's suggestion that arrangements would involve ""a lot of work,"" told the agent, ""This isn't just, you know, a few documents. ... I'm making a career choice."" The camera in the undercover video is positioned over that agent's right shoulder, looking directly at Nozette. When the agent asked whether the negotiations were only for himself, Nozette said yes, and suggested his wife would not accompany him. ""She would ask too many questions,"" Nozette said. The wife, Wendy McColough, was not seen in the courtroom Thursday, but had been in the spectator gallery October 20 when her husband made his initial appearance. A transcript of the undercover video came out just hours before Thursday's proceeding. Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Asuncion has said evidence will show Nozette disclosed to investigators information that was ""top secret, related to our national defense, that would cause exceptionally grave damage to national security"" if revealed to a foreign country. In an affidavit, the FBI sets out the case against Nozette, who received a doctorate in planetary sciences from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Nozette had a ""top secret"" clearance and served at the White House on the National Space Council for President George H.W. Bush, the affidavit says. Later, from early 2000 to early 2006, he did research and development for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Naval Research Laboratory, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, it says. The document says Nozette also acted as a technical consultant from 1998 until early 2008 ""for an aerospace company that was wholly owned by the government of the state of Israel."" The company consulted with Nozette monthly, getting answers to questions, and he received total payments of $225,000, the affidavit says. In early September, Nozette was contacted by phone by an individual purporting to be an Israeli intelligence officer, but who really was an FBI undercover agent, the document says. They met in downtown Washington in front of a hotel, and over lunch, Nozette ""demonstrated his willingness to work for Israeli intelligence,"" it says. The undercover agent engaged in a series of meetings with Nozette, and eventually Nozette allegedly deposited ""secret"" information in a ""dead drop"" post office box. Some of the information, the affidavit says, was classified as secret. The criminal complaint does not accuse the government of Israel of any violations of U.S. law. Nozette next has a status hearing November 10 at U.S. District Court, before Judge James Robertson.","Stewart David Nozette appeared Thursday in U.S. District Court .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Mountainous terrain and harsh weather in remote parts of Afghanistan have proven a deadly combination for the U.S. military in its push to reduce mounting violence in the country. CNN obtained this photo of a U.S. helicopter above Forward Operating Base Keating in the Nuristan province. On Saturday, Taliban militants attacked American and Afghan troops in the Nuristan province in eastern Afghanistan. Eight American troops and two members of the Afghan national security forces were killed, according to the Pentagon. It was the largest number of Americans killed by hostile action in a single day since July 13, 2008, when nine troops died, according to CNN records. The fighting was so fierce that at one point U.S. forces ""had to collapse in on themselves,"" a U.S. military official with knowledge of the latest intelligence reports on the incident told CNN. These revelations about the battle that engulfed Forward Operating Base Keating are a further indication of how pinned down and outmanned the troops were.  Watch more on the attack in rural Afghanistan Â» . The base was scheduled to be closed in the next few days, CNN has learned. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top commander in Afghanistan, wanted to cede remote outposts and consolidate troops in more populated areas to better protect Afghan civilians. It's a point he reiterated over the summer. ""Practically speaking, there are areas that are controlled by Taliban forces,"" he told the Los Angeles Times in late July. Over time, McChrystal said, the command would ""reduce"" those areas, but the first priority will be to make sure populated areas are free of insurgent influence. The deadly attack over the weekend and the July 2008 attack in Wanat, just 20 miles away, serve to underscore, some say, that the reduction isn't happening.  View an interactive map of the two attacks Â» . It's an assessment that one veteran military observer discussed in a column earlier this year. ""Screwups are inevitable in war. But there are serious questions to be addressed,"" Foreign Policy magazine's Tom Ricks wrote in a January 2009 online article. ""As one Army source put it to me, 'The paratroopers sent to Wanat knew they were in big trouble. ... [The soldiers] ran out of water and had little material to build up their defensive positions,' "" Ricks wrote. Peter Bergen, a CNN terrorism analyst, called the repetition ""a huge problem.""  ""It is suposed to be a lessons-learned exercise,"" Bergen said. ""And then, exactly 20 miles away from the event about a year ago, exactly the same kind of attack happened."" In the Wanat fight, 49 U.S. troops were attacked by nearly 200 Taliban fighters, and the base was later abandoned. ""So, you have to ask yourself, what were the lessons learned? Or were the lessons not implemented? And these remote combat outposts, you know, are obviously sitting ducks,"" Bergen said. The Nuristan and Wanat fights add to the growing list of problems facing the Obama administration. The White House is in the midst of a comprehensive review of U.S. strategy in Afghanistan. McChrystal, who took over four months ago as the top U.S. commander in the country, has submitted an assessment in which, sources have told CNN, calls for additional forces to carry out a successful counterinsurgency strategy. But some in the administration, including Vice President Joe Biden, are advocating a counterterrorism strategy focusing on combating al Qaeda and the Taliban through the use of unmanned drones and special forces without involving additional troops.  Watch more on the varying advice Obama is getting Â» . Others believe that a broader counterinsurgency approach -- requiring a larger military operation in the country -- is needed. Several top military leaders and opposition Republicans are pressing Obama to act quickly to increase the present 68,000-troop level by as many as 40,000. In March, Obama announced a plan to send more than 20,000 additional troops to the country to provide security for a national election. ""If we don't add more troops, you're going to see more of what happened yesterday,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""The security situation's going to get worse. And any hope of better governance is lost, and the Taliban will re-emerge."" Despite criticism, Obama said Tuesday that U.S. efforts in Afghanistan have had a major impact. ""Al Qaeda and its allies have not only lost operational capacity, they've lost legitimacy and credibility,"" he said. ""We're making real progress in our core mission: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and other extremist networks around the world."" Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Monday that the Taliban currently has the momentum in the country. He warned that a Taliban takeover of the country would empower the al Qaeda terrorist network.  Watch more of Gates' remarks Â» . ""Because of our inability and the inability, frankly, of our allies to put enough troops in Afghanistan, the Taliban do have the momentum right now,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour and former CNN Washington Bureau Chief Frank Sesno in a panel discussion that included Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Gates said an eventual Taliban victory would provide ""added space"" for al Qaeda to set up in the country and enhance recruiting and fundraising, bolstered by the perception that, having driven out the Soviet Union in the 1980s, Muslim forces have won a second victory over a superpower. CNN's Barbara Starr, Atia Abawi and journalist Matiullah Mati contributed to this report.","8 U.S. soldiers, two Afghan soldiers killed in attack in Nuristan province .
