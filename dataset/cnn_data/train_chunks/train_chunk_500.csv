Jackie Stretton will never make a full recovery from the injuries she suffered in the crash in April and she now walks with the aid of a back brace . A judge has launched a stinging attack on the justice system after he was powerless to hand longer sentences to two men who left a young woman crippled in an horrific car crash as they fled from police. Judge Rodger Hayward-Smith QC, had to sentence prolific offenders Jason Young, 21, and Tyrell O’Donnell, 20, to less than 18 months after they stole a car and fled police in a 100mph chase across two counties, which ended when their Fiat Stilo smashed into Jackie Stretton’s car leaving her severely injured. Judge Hawyard-Smith, who is bound by strict sentencing guidelines laid down by the government, handed the maximum . possible sentences of two years each for aggravated vehicle taking but . both terms were automatically reduced by a third due to the men’s guilty . pleas. However, he stunned Chelmsford Crown Court, Essex when he said the pair deserved much longer behind bars. He said: 'You will get out of prison and . will get your life back but Jackie Stretton will never get over this, . physically or mentally. 'It is absurd - if I just pass sentence and allow credit for your guilty pleas, because I have to - it will not be enough. 'It is awful. I am stuck with it because of what the law says, and I can’t abide it. 'Jackie Stretton has suffered a very great deal and both defendants are in their twenties with appalling previous records. 'You . deserve, both of you, to go to prison for a very long time and I . greatly regret that I am restricted in what sentence I can give you . because of what Parliament has decided. 'You say you are sorry and I hope that you are because the sentence I have passed is nothing like enough.' Miss Stretton, 25, of Maldon, Essex, . suffered 'appalling injuries' as she broke her back and suffered . bleeding to her brain in the crash and was left clinging to life in . hospital. Her kneecap was also broken and she was airlifted to Queen’s Hospital, Romford, and placed in a drug-induced coma. Jail: Jason Young, 21, left, and Tyrell O’Donnell, . 20, right, were sentenced to less than 18 months after they stole a car and fled police in a . 100mph chase across two counties then crashed into Jackie Stretton's car .

She had completed charity marathons and coast-to-coast . adventure races, but will never make a full recovery from the injuries she . suffered in the crash in April and she now walks with the aid of a back . brace. Young and O’Donnell, both from Devon, were both sentenced after they admitted charges of aggravated vehicle taking. The court heard that O’Donnell was arrested at the scene but Young fled and did not turn himself in to police until five days later. Frustration: Judge Hawyard-Smith stunned . Chelmsford Crown Court, Essex, when he said the pair deserved much longer behind bars . Law graduate Miss . Stretton looked on in tears as the two men were sentenced - 18 months . for the driver of the stolen car O’Donnell, and 16 months for his . passenger Young. The pair - who both have a long string of motoring offences - were banned from the roads for five years. Miss Stretton is no longer able to . drive, so had to catch the bus from her home to be at court to witness the men . who ruined her life being sentenced. She said: 'I just feel so relieved that it is over but my life has changed and I won’t get that back. 'I have been told that I may need my kneecap replaced when I reach 50 and I won’t ever get compensated for that. 'I . love my sports but I have not been able to compete and it has also . affected my relationships with people because I have changed since it . happened.' Miss Stretton welcomed the men’s ban from the roads. She . added: 'I am really happy that they have been disqualified from driving . for five years - that is the bit that is hopefully going to make a . difference. 'They have so many previous driving offences - their records went on for pages.' Richard . Stevens, prosecuting, had told the court the men had stolen the Fiat . from a caravan park in Suffolk at 5.30am on April 5.

Court: Miss Stretton told Chelmsford Crown Court, pictured, that she is no longer able to drive, . so caught the bus from her home to be at court to witness the men who . ruined her life being sentenced . The pair headed towards London at incredibly fast speeds - often over 100mph - and at one stage going 80mph in a 30mph residential area. The car was seen cutting between lanes on the A12 as police followed them.

The governor of the Bank of England has today criticised a New York state agency for publicly accusing UK bank Standard Chartered of money laundering for Iran and terror groups. Sir Mervyn King said the New York State Department of Financial Services was wrong to make the claims when other regulators were still investigating any wrong-doing. Standard Chartered was accused on Monday of laundering £160billion and promptly saw its share price plummet. By the end of trading on Tuesday, £6billion had been wiped from the bank's stock price. Standard insist any violations would total a maximum of £9million. At a news conference, Sir Mervyn contrasted the Standard Chartered case with the way in which U.S. and British agencies dealt with their investigation of Barclays' manipulation of the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR). He said: 'In the LIBOR one, all the regulators involved, whether it be in the United States or in England, produced coordinated publication of reports which came out after the investigation was completed and they had made their judgments. 'That's very different from what's happened in the Standard Chartered case where one regulator, but not the others, has gone public while the investigation is still going on.' But he insisted U.S. authorities were not singling out British banks for attention, adding: 'Clearly, if there has been wrongdoing, then action should certainly be taken.' Standard Chartered said yesterday it was continuing to cooperate with the Department of Financial Services and four other U.S. authorities: the Department of Justice, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Federal Reserve Group of New York and the District Attorney of New York. The bank said it voluntarily approached the agencies in January 2010 'and informed them that we had initiated a review of historical U.S. dollar transactions and their compliance with U.S. sanctions' primarily between 2001 and 2007. Watchdog: Lord Turner, left, was ethics watchdog for Standard Chartered during the period it is accused of funding Palestinian Islamic Jihad activists, seen right posing with mock detonator charges and bomb vests . Standard Chartered shares were up 7.3 percent to 1,318 pence in midday trading, rebounding from a 16.7 percent drop on Tuesday. But the bank was mired in more controversy today, however, when it emerged Britain's top financial regulator worked as an ethics watchdog for them during the period of alleged irregularities. Lord Turner was on the bank’s payroll during the period it is accused of hiding £160billion of transfers used to fund terror groups and Iran’s weapons programmes. The chairman of the Financial Services Authority worked part time at the UK bank as a non-executive director from August 2006 to September 2008, receiving an annual pay package of £188,000. A pedestrian walks past a branch of Standard Chartered bank in Hong Kong. The bank is accused of hiding £160billion of its transfers used to fund terror groups and Iran's weapons programmes . Lord Turner is chairman of the Financial Services Authority, the industry's watchdog . One of his key roles was sitting on . Standard Chartered’s audit and risk committee, which was supposed to . police bad behaviour and ensure rules were followed. The committee was also in charge of the company’s ‘speaking up’ policy where staff could raise concerns in confidence. Although there is no suggestion of wrong doing by Lord Turner, the close ties with Standard Chartered are acutely embarrassing for the peer who has been touted as a leading contender to replace Sir Mervyn as governor of the Bank of England. The . news comes amid calls for a full Parliamentary inquiry into money . laundering, prompted by the revelation that HSBC is to be fined up to . £600million for handling billions of pounds from Mexican drug lords and . rogue states. A number of candidates for the governor's role have suffered damage to their reputations. The . Bank’s deputy governor Paul Tucker has been accused of instructing . Barclays to rig crucial interest rates used to set mortgages. This culminated in a £290million fine for Barclays, with at least 15 other financial institutions including Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds under investigation. Lord Green, a former boss of HSBC and another tip for the job, has been fending off calls to resign as trade minister after the bank was accused of money laundering. And . Peter Sands, Standard Chartered’s chief executive, had also been tipped . as an outside bet for the top job at Threadneedle Street. He is now fighting to salvage the bank’s battered reputation and reassure panicked investors. Standard Chartered was accused on Monday of being a ‘rogue . institution’ and conspiring with Tehran for much of the past decade to . breach US sanctions. The New York Department of Financial Services accused the bank of handling 60,000 secret  transfers amounting to at least £160billion from Iranian clients through its New York office. These included state-owned banks suspected of funding the regime’s nuclear weapons programme and  groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. To conceal these transactions from the authorities, the bank is accused of routinely ‘stripping’ out information that would have revealed the identity of the Iranian clients. This is alleged to have occurred between 2001 and 2010. According to the regulator’s report Lord Turner’s committee was informed of the suspect behaviour in 2006. Sources close to the peer point out that he had limited powers to stop payments and would have relied on information within the bank. John Mann MP, a member of the  Treasury Select Committee, yesterday called for a UK Parliamentary inquiry into money laundering. But he also accused US regulators of an anti-British bias. Standard Chartered yesterday hit back at the allegations from US regulators and claimed that just £9million in transactions breached US sanctions. A spokesman said: ‘The group strongly rejects the position or the portrayal of facts as set out in the order issued by the DFS.’","New York State Department of Financial Services went public with its claim as bank was still being investigated .

A gold medal-winning Paralympian had his medal hopes at London 2012 ruined when he was knocked down by a hit and run driver while training, a court heard today. Double gold medallist Simon Richardson MBE, 44, was training on a dual carriageway in Bridgend, South Wales, when he was knocked off his cycle by a driver allegedly twice over the drink-drive limit. Mr Richardson was training hard to qualify for the 2012 London games, but his bike was destroyed and he suffered life-threatening spinal and lower body injuries which ruled him out of competition. Hopes dashed: Richardson, 44, pictured after his gold medal win at the Beijing 2008 Paralympics, had his hopes of a medal in London ruined after the hit-and-run crash . Farmer Edward Adams, 60, is accused of hitting Mr Richardson while more than double the drink-drive limit - and driving with chronically bad eye-sight. A jury heard today that Adams should not have been driving because his judgement was 'severely impaired'. Prosecutor Jane Rowley told Newport Crown Court today: 'Mr Adams simply drove through him. He collided into the rear of his bicycle with the passenger side of his van. 'Mr Richardson and the bicycle were thrown into the air and he travelled 26m before landing on the grass verge. 'His specialised Beijing Paralympics bike was broken into pieces due to the force of the impact and Mr Richardson suffered serious life threatening injuries. 'Mr Adam’s driving was more than simply careless, it was dangerous and incompetent.' Mr Richardson, of Porthcawl, South Wales, suffered fractures to his spine, sternum and pelvis and was left with deep lacerations to his leg and a perforated bowel. Richardson, who won two golds and a silver at the Beijing 2008 Paralympics, had hoped for more glory but is now ruled out of the competition . Injured: Richardson, pictured outside court last year with his wife, suffered life-threatening injuries which ruled him out of competing at the London 2012 Games after being hit by Adams, right . Adams, pictured arriving at a court hearing last year, was allegedly twice over the drink-drive limit and had 'severely impaired judgement' He received an MBE after winning two golds and one silver medal at Beijing in 2008. Mr Richardson was in training for the London Paralympics and had clocked up 250 miles on the country roads near his home. He was 20 miles into his training ride when he was hit from behind by the passing van. But he was left lying on the grass verge as Adams drove away from the scene of the crash and tried to hide the van at his farm near Cowbridge, South Wales. The court heard even with his driving glasses on he could not read a number plate from four metres away - and could only partially read one from two metres. Motorist Gordon Broomfield drove past the cyclist before witnessing the crash in his rear view mirror. He said: 'The visibility was very good and I had no trouble seeing the cyclist from a distance away on the very straight road and passing him. 'When I looked back I saw the white van coming closer to the cyclist. 'I kept waiting to see when it would move out of the way but it just kept on going. He drove through him. 'I was just in disbelief that this all happened.' Mr Broomfield gave police the registration number of the white Peugeot van he had seen as it drove away. Miss Rowley said the van was found later by police helicopter flying over Adams’ farm. Accident: Mr Richardson was 20 miles into his training ride when he was knocked off his specially-made cycle on thos dual carriageway in Bridgend, South Wales, last August . Officers landed nearby - and found Adams in his house with a tumbler of whisky and was double the drink-drive limit. Adams initially denied any knowledge of the crash in August last year - but later admitted he was behind the wheel. Adams told police he was bilnded by the glare from the sun and thought he had 'hit a sheep'. He said: 'There was a bang and I thought: 'Oh my God I have hit a sheep'. But then I thought 'Oh well there are a lot of them around' and so I carried on. 'When I got home I had a couple of whiskys to calm myself down because I was shaking. I didn’t realise I had hit a person. I am very sorry I hit someone.' Adams, of Pentre Meyrick, Vale of Glamorgan, denies one charge of dangerous driving. He has admitted drink-driving and failing to stop after an accident. The trial at Newport Crown Court continues.

Footage has now emerged of the incredible morning raid on the New Zealand mansion of a man at the head of a suspected Internet piracy website. Helicopters, police dogs and more than 70 specially trained officers - some heavily armed with semi-automatic assault rifles - were involved in the land and air raid on the property of Megaupload.com boss Kim . Dotcom - also known as Kim Schmitz. The January 20 raid was part of an . investigation of his website spearheaded by the FBI in the U.S. Scroll down for video . Helicopter cam: Footage shows a helicopter swooping down on the property of Megauppload.com boss Kim Dotcom. The gates to the property are clearly open in the bottom centre of the picture . Armed raid: Members of the Special Tactics Group, armed with assault rifles, run toward the door of Dotcom's mansion near Auckland. Inside are Dotcom and his family, some guests and staff - all unarmed . Simultaneous ground assault: As the first helicopter leaves, a police vehicle (highlighted) can already be seen on the property. Dotcom's lawyers have asked why helicopters were even necessary in the raid . The operation, where police executed warrants to seize . computer hard drives from the mansion, has since been ruled illegal by the New Zealand High Court. The footage, edited from in-flight helicopter cameras and Dotcom's own security CCTV system, shows the sort of raid usually witnessed in over-the-top Hollywood films. Aired on New Zealand's 3News TV programme, and re-broadcast on YouTube, it shows members of New Zealand's Special Tactics Group - armed with Colt Commando assault rifles and Glock handguns - arriving in two helicopters at 6.47am, with dog squad officers and more armed authorities arriving in cars and vans almost immediately after. Colt Commando: The U.S.-made AR15 assault rifle, which was carried by members of the raid as their 'primary' weapon. Specialist officers also carried a 17-shot Glock handgun and extra ammunition . Evidence: Kim Dotcom describes to the court the events of January 20 this year, while the picture above right shows armed officers on the roof of Dotcom's mansion as the raid unfolds . Inside the house are Dotcom, his pregnant wife, their three children and a number of guests and staff. There is no suggestion that any of them were armed. Raid planners say the airborne force was necessary because Dotcom's property had security gates that prevented police from approaching with vehicles. Their swift arrival was crucial, as Dotcom or a member of his staff could erase important evidence from hard drives on the property. But the gates to the property are clearly open as the first helicopter flies in, and multiple vehicles can be seen simultaneously closing in on the house. Later an officer reveals over his radio that there are only two security staff members on the entire property. Police response: Arrows point to four separate police vans and vehicles on the Dotcom property less than 20 minutes after the first helicopter landed in the driveway . Officers from the second helicopter even run through the opened and unmanned gates. Dotcom and his legal team also contest the authorities' 'element of surprise' justification, saying that the FBI had seized servers and had made it impossible for anyone to erase hard drives before the raid had even taken place. The footage shows what is generally known to have happened in the raid, but Dotcom's lawyers - both in New Zealand and the U.S. - are concentrating on why the raid was so heavy handed. In particular, they have asked authotrites why - if Dotcom was deemed dangerous enough to warrant an airborne and armed raid - why participating officers were not wearing full armed response clothing and body armour. Second wave: More heavily armed Special Tactics Group officers arrive in a second helicopter, and are seen running through the gate that was supposed to prevent their entry . In court footage also on the 3News/YouTube clip, an unnamed and unidentified officer involved in the raid said the lack of full protective kit was a response to the 'low threat' posed by Dotcom and his house guests. Dotcom was one of four men arrested during the operation. He is accused of being the ringleader of a group that . netted $175million since 2005 by copying and distributing music, films . and other copyrighted content without authorisation. Dotcom's lawyers say the company simply offered online storage. In June Justice . Helen Winkelmann ruled that . the warrants used in the seizure of property from Dotcom's mansion near . Auckland were illegal. The judge also ruled that moves by the FBI to copy data from Dotcom's . computer and take it offshore were unlawful. Dogs and more guns: A member of the dog squad can be seen crossing the driveway to gain entry to the house, above left, while yet more armed officers arrive in unmarked police vehicles .

Before . it was shut down in January, Megaupload was one of the world's most . popular websites, where millions of users stored data, either for free . or by paying for premium service. Authorities say Megaupload.com and related sites cheated copyright holders out of more than $500million. U.S. lawyers for Megaupload have also argued that American federal . authorities cannot charge the company with criminal behaviour because it . is Hong Kong-based, and also that no papers have ever been formally . served.","Lawyers for Megaupload boss Kim Dotcom ask why raid was so excessive .

A 17-year-old from Michigan who was discouraged to continue boxing by her father has taken gold at the Olympics in the first year females have competed in the sport. Middleweight boxer Claressa Shields won the ultimate prize, which she had referred to as 'my gold medal' throughout the entire Games, in a 19-12 victory over Russia's Nadezda Torlopova. It means she is the only gold medal winner in the 12-member American team, and marks her as the youngest boxer to win an Olympic gold since 16-year-old John Fields of the U.S. won in 1924. The win, . which comes just two years after Shields started on the international . circuit, is also in spite of her troubled upbringing and absent parents . in one of the nation's most troubled cities. Smile of a winner: Seventeen-year-old Claressa Shields from Michigan is named as the winner of the women's middleweight boxing in the Olympics on Thursday over Nadezda Torlopova of Russia . She grew up in Flint, Michigan, which has the highest violent crime rate in the country for a city of its size, as well as the highest number of murders per capita and devastating unemployment rates. Shields first met her father, Clarence Shields, when she was nine after he was released from a seven-year prison stint for breaking and entering - and even after, she rarely saw him. When she confronted her father over his whereabouts, he revealed he was embarrassed about his lack of money and felt he couldn't face the family, CBS Sports reported. 'To me, he was never a bad . guy,' Shields told the website. 'I spent a whole lot of time with him, and then . he'd disappear. I was like, if he wants to be a father, OK, but . if not, well I went a whole long time without a dad. I can accept it and . live with it.' Fighter: The victory makes her the most successful boxer on Team USA; no men won medals this Olympics . Joy: Shields celebrates her medal. It is the first time women's boxing has taken place at the Olympics . But her father did want to exercise some fatherly influence over her - when it came to boxing. She first started the sport for fun after a friend, a boy, bet her she could not last a week training at Berston, which offers a free boxing program. When her father found out, he said no. He claimed that it was a sport for men, and his daughter should have no part in it. 'I told him, ""If you're going to give me a reason not to do something, . give me a better reason than just that I'm a girl, 'cause that don't . fly"",' Shields said. Shields' mother, Marcella . Adams, was also largely absent. She often decided to pick up and . leave at a moment's notice, leaving Shields to be passed from relatives . to friends since she was born. Not giving up: Her father Clarence Shields, pictured watching his daughter on TV, told her she could not do the sport. She only met him when she was nine after he finished a jail sentence . Determined: Shields, who first began boxing when a boy friend bet her she couldn't do it, is pictured training . On her own: Shields, pictured during a shoot for Sports Illustrated, constantly moved between relatives' and friends' homes as her mother often moved away and then returned . In the past year alone, the athlete has lived in four different homes - which she says is a result of her own decision to leave her mother's for good. She moved in with her mother in December 2010 after her grandmother, who she lived with at the time, passed away. But after staying with Adams, her grades and health began to slip. 'You can't live boxing at the gym, then go home and not eat right and be . well,' Shields said. 'The decision to leave was all me. Nobody needs to . feel sorry for me.' After moving in with an aunt and then a friend, she finally moved in with her boxing coach, Jason Crutchfield, his . girlfriend and their six-year-old son, Jayden, in the Flint suburb of . Mount Morris. Eyes on the prize: Throughout the competition, she has often called the ultimate prize 'my gold medal' Support: Shields, who begins her senior year of high school this fall, is pictured with her stepmother . 'She needed it,' Crutchfield said. 'I've . been kind of hard on her lately. I’m focused on getting this gold medal . for her, so I wanted to lighten . up the load off.' He said that he first met Shields when she was 14, and immediately knew she was capable of making the Olympics. He added that her energy and stamina are that of an . average male fighter four or five years her senior. 'Her ability to focus on what's she's fighting is kind of outstanding. No matter what's going on around her, and what's . happening, she's able to focus on what's happening in the ring,' he said. And Shields has undoubtedly been ready to unleash that power throughout her entire Olympics journey, often tweeting about 'my gold medal' and how she's 'ready to handle business'. Speaking to CBS, she added that she has fought through adversity and there's no way she's veering off the straight path. No chance: At 17, Shields is nearly half the age of her Russian opponent, 33-year-old Torlopova . No chance: Her coach said she has the stamina and energy of a man four to five years her senior . Success: Shields lifts her arms in celebration after winning her fight against Russia's Nadezda Torlopova . 'I have friends smoking stuff, but they’d never offer me a drink, or hit . me up to smoke a blunt,' she said. 'That doesn't help me with what I . can achieve.' Last October, she won her weight class at the National PAL Boxing Championships in Toledo, which qualified her for the U.S. Olympic trials . in February . Shields, who will be a senior at high school next year, made the age cutoff by just two months. With . her gold medal she has proven to be the most successful boxer on Team . USA; none of the male competitors placed in the top three and flyweight Marlen Esparza won a bronze. Back home in Flint, her friends and . family - including her father Clarence - gathered to watch her televised . bouts in bars and community centres. Disbelief: Shields is overjoyed as she celebrates her gold medal on the podium on Thursday . Winners: Nadezda Torlopova of Russia, right, took silver while Marina Volnova of Kazakhstan, left, and Li Jinzi of China, second left, took bronze. Grinning, Shields shows off her gold . Bryant Nolden, a councilman, told the Detroit News: 'She’s a rose that grew out of a concrete jungle. If a rose can grow through concrete, you know it has to be very resilient.' After her dazzling performance in the ring - even sticking her tongue out Torlopova in the final round - she gasped in shock as she was announced the winner, lifting her arms to cheers from the crowd. The Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, will no doubt be sore that she left just before the nail-biting match after watching British boxer Nicola Adams take the featherweight crown. On the podium, Shields flashed a wide open-mouthed smile before holding her hand over her heart to sing the national anthem. Life may have dealt her a few knocks in her 17 years, but she has proved she can hit back even harder.","Claressa Shields, 17, beat Russia's Nadezda Torlopova, 33, to take gold .

When it comes to planning for future happiness, Americans should hedge their bets and head west for Utah. The state has emerged top of the most 'forward-looking' regions in the U.S., after a study found its citizens to be the most satisfied with their quality of life. A Gallup study analyzed where would be the best place to live in America in the coming five . years based on 13 factors including clean water, safe places to exercise . and how well you are treated by your boss. John Denver called West Virginia 'almost heaven' but the country roads appear to have lost their luster. The research also revealed the Mountain State was the least desirable place to live in the U.S., with Mississippi and Kentucky close behind. State of mind: The top ten states to live in the future are marked out in green - with Utah leading the way - while those which polled as most undesirable are in red . One to watch: Salt Lake City, Utah, with the snow-peaked Wasatch Mountains in the distance, is set to be the best place to live in the U.S. The findings were based on interviews with half a million Americans between January 2011 and June of this year. Much of the American South rated poorly . when it came to quality of life with greater health problems, more smokers and higher levels of obesity. Utah, Minnesota and Colorado were the . top three places to live with much of the Midwest and the tropical . paradise of Hawaii listed among desirable destinations. Utah comes out on top because of its clean living reputation - likely due to the state's high Mormon population. It has the lowest number of smokers and clean and safe drinking water is easily accessible. Supervisors in the state treat . workers like a partner rather than a boss giving them a greater sense of . self-worth, lower stress levels and higher job satisfaction. American life: The top ten states to live in (left) and those which ranked the worst in the U.S. Top towns: The historic market district in Omaha, Nebraska (left) which came fourth in the top ten while Minneapolis in Minnesota came second . The . residents of Utah who were surveyed also held the opinion that things . were generally 'getting better' rather than 'getting worse'. Gallup used 13 factors . to gauge a state's livability - including the economy, job prospects and . personal finances along with . quality-of-life components like obesity rates, smoking and how many . trips residents made to the dentist. West Virginia suffers from lack of . full-time employment opportunities and also scored the second-lowest . median household income of $38,218. The state ranked eighth in the country when it came to people living below the poverty line, at 17.62 per cent. State of the union: 13 factors were used to determine which were the best places to live in the U.S. Badlands: High unemployment and poor health has made West Virginia the worst state to live in the United States, according to a Gallup study . The Mountain State was also the . unhealthiest, with the greatest number of smokers. A quarter . of West Virginians smoked in . 2011. Obesity levels were also the highest in the U.S. at 35.3 per cent. For Mississippi, the second worst place to live, the greatest concern was employment prospects for residents. The state had the lowest percentage of people employed full-time and the . lowest median income in the country at $36,851 - less than three-quarters of the . national average of $50,046. The best and worst states were based on findings of 530,000 interviews from 2011. Americans were asked about: . Full-time employment for an employer: 'Good jobs' were linked to higher GDP and improved wellbeing. Regions that can create these jobs and attract talent to fill them will be best positioned for economic growth. Economic confidence index: Optimism is higher if residents were more assured about where the economy is headed. Job creation index: Where there is more hiring than firing in the workplace, the economy grows and citizens were happier. Supervisor relationship: Being partnered with rather than bossed around at work, lays a foundation for improved productivity, as well as improved emotional and physical health. Standard of living optimism: Where people are more likely to say things are getting better, there is often higher economic confidence. City optimism: Linked to lower unemployment, better environmental quality and greater satisfaction with the community. Daily learning: Bettering residents on a daily basis is a critical psychological need. Easy access to clean, safe water: Essential for human survival, safe water is closely linked to the physical environment and wellbeing. Easy access to a safe place to exercise: Means lower obesity and related chronic conditions, as well as lower crime rates. Obesity: Where there are more obese people, there are higher mortality rates, more chronic conditions and higher healthcare costs. Smoking: Means higher mortality rates, substantially higher risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and cancers. Dentist visits: While no longer linked to future heart attack and stroke, poor oral health has been associated with periodontal disease, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, preterm deaths, and erectile dysfunction. Future life evaluation: Where residents are optimistic about their life in five years, there is more optimism. It also has the highest percentage of the population living below the poverty line and has the second-highest rate of obesity and the fifth-highest . percentage of smokers. The state also had the lowest number of residents visiting the dentist last year which is related to a plethora of health problems. The state of Kentucky's median income - $40,062 - was the fourth lowest of all states. The Bluegrass State . also measured the fourth-highest percentage of people below the poverty . line and people on food stamps/SNAP benefits. Among the desirable places to settle down, Utah, Minnesota and Colorado were the top picks. Job opportunities in Utah were . believed to be booming.

A Palestinian inmate serving a life sentence has managed to father a son from behind bars - after smuggling a sperm sample out of jail to his wife. Dallal Ziben, 32, gave birth to baby Muhannad after being artificially inseminated by 37-year-old husband Ammar, who is currently serving 32 life sentences in an Israeli prison. Palestinians are not permitted to receive conjugal visits, and although Dallal Ziben has not set eyes on her husband for 15 years, she says she fell pregnant after being artificially inseminated by sperm her 37-year-old husband managed to sneak out of Hadarim prison in central Israel. Palestinian mother Dallal holds her newborn son Muhannad, who was fathered by her prisoner husband Ammar, pictured above her head . 'Praise be to Allah who has blessed us after a long absence with my husband in prison,' Ziben told AFP shortly before going in for an elective Caesarean. 'My husband and I, our two girls and the family have been waiting for this for such a long time,' she said. Ziben, who comes from Meithalun village between Nablus and Jenin, already had an 18-month-old daughter called Basha'er when her husband, who belongs to the Islamist Hamas movement, was arrested. At the time, she was also five months pregnant with their second daughter, Bissan. 'I am very happy. This is the first genuine happiness in our house for more than 15 years,' smiles Basha'er, now 16. The child's father Ammar Ziben, 37, is serving a life sentence in an Israeli prison . 'When my mother told us she was going to get inseminated and give us a baby brother, we couldn't believe it,' she said. 'We have always wanted a brother and now the dream has come true.' After the expectant mother was wheeled into the operating theatre, a group of women from the family gathered outside to wait, breaking into celebratory ululation at the first sound of a baby crying. Standing outside the operating theatre, the proud grandmother said her son-in-law had named the baby after one of his friends 'who was a martyr.' Asked if the family objected to the way her daughter fell pregnant, she responded angrily. 'We are honourable people who are known for our good reputation and everyone supports us,' she snapped. For . her son-in-law, who no longer has any immediate family living in the . Palestinian territories, having a boy gives him a way of prolonging his . line, she said, explaining that his mother, father and brother had died, . and that a second brother was living overseas. Details . of how the sperm was smuggled out of the prison was kept a closely . guarded secret, with the family refusing to give the slightest . information. A spokeswoman . for the Israel Prisons Service said she was not aware of the pregnancy, . and that security prisoners were not allowed conjugal visits, with the . Palestinian Prisoners' Club confirming the same information. 'Visits . by prisoners' wives are closely supervised by prison guards and there . is no way a prisoner could get time alone with his wife,' said a . Nablus-based spokesman. Dr Saalem Abu al-Kheizaran, head of the Razan fertility clinic in Nablus which carried out the insemination procedure, said the sperm had been subjected to a gender separation process to ensure the couple would have a son. Celebration: The boy's mother Dallal looks over at her newborn son at the hospital in the Palestinian West Bank city of Nablus . 'We received a sample of sperm from the husband in a reliable and clinically secure way,' he told AFP, without going into details. 'The couple wanted a baby boy, so we carried out a gender separation procedure. We tried the insemination process three times from the same sample, but the first two attempts failed,' he said. Abu al-Kheizaran said the right to have a baby was a universal human right. 'For us it is a humanitarian issue -- everyone has the right to be a parent. Prison must not stand in the way of this right,' he told AFP. Samer Samaro from the Nablus branch of the prisoners' ministry agrees. Baby Muhanad is wheeled to his Palestinian mother, whose husband belongs to the Islamist Hamas movement . 'Having the child is a prisoner's right. We hope to someday reach an agreement with the Israeli side about this issue,' he said. Samaro said that even Israelis were allowed that right, including Yigal Amir, the right-wing extremist who gunned down prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in November 1995. Amir, who was caught trying to smuggle sperm out of prison in 2006, was later given permission to artificially inseminate his wife, who gave birth to a son in 2007. Says Samaro: 'Even Rabin's murderer had a baby while he was in prison, so why should Palestinians be deprived of that right?'","Dallal Ziben artificially inseminated by prisoner husband .

The head of Romney's VP search process, longtime confidante Beth Myers, broke her silence on many details in a briefing with reporters inside a hangar at Dulles International Airport near Washington. Romney and Ryan themselves spoke to reporters briefly on their flight to North Carolina. Almost a week ago, Ryan snuck through Chicago's O'Hare airport in a baseball cap and sunglasses and flew to New England.

Schools will no longer be required in law to maintain a specific amount of space on their playing fields for team sports under rules brought in on the eve of the Olympics. Education Secretary Michael Gove has scrapped regulations which dictate how much space schools should provide for their pupils for team games. New rules state merely that ‘suitable’ outdoor space must be provided for sport and play. Thing of the past? Schools will no longer be required to maintain a specific amount of space on their playing fields for team sports under rules brought in on the eve of the Olympics . The move calls into question the Coalition’s strategy on school sport and building a lasting Olympic legacy which boosts competitive games. Critics warned that more playing fields could now be sold off, undermining the Coalition’s commitment to strengthening competitive sport. David Cameron recently pledged to put sports such as netball, tennis and football on the national curriculum for primary school children and said the ethos of schools must change so pupils learn that ‘winning and losing is an important part of growing up’. The new rules on school playing fields were drawn up on July 19, laid before Parliament on July 30 and come into force in October. Under current regulations, dating from 1999, schools are expected to follow detailed rules on outdoor space laid down in a table which is enshrined in law. Primary schools with fewer than 200 pupils, for example, should set aside 30 square yards or 25 square metres of ‘game playing field’ for every child. Up and running: London 2012 chariman Lord Coe and Prime Minister David Cameron have praised the success of the Olympics and pledge to build a lasting legacy which boosts competitive sport . Larger primaries must set aside 50 square yards, or 42 square metres. Secondary schools must set aside up to 60 square yards, or 50 square metres, depending on its size. But a recent Government consultation found many state schools were struggling to meet the requirements and suggested they be modified. School sport has proved a tricky issue for the Coalition during the Olympics after it emerged that it has scrapped a target for schools to provide two hours of PE a week. It also emerged that Mr Gove has sanctioned the disposal of 22 playing fields, although most were at schools that had closed or were merging. The Department for Education said it would soon consult on a new minimum requirement for playing field space, which would be simpler than the current ‘bureaucratic’ table of ratios. This would be non-binding guidance. Contradictions: Despite a pledge by Mr Cameron to put team sports on the national curriculum, Education Secretary Michael Gove (pictured) has scrapped regulations which dictate how much playing field space schools need to provide . Officials insisted the new policy states for the first time that all schools must have access to suitable outdoor space for both formal PE lessons and for outdoor play, rather than simply team sport. But Alison Moore-Gwyn, of the charity . Fields In Trust, warned that playing fields could be cut back and called . for a ‘firm commitment from the Government to prioritise school sport . and facilities’. Tim Lamb, . chief executive of the Sport and Recreation Alliance, an umbrella . organisation for sports bodies, said the old regulations had been a ‘key . tool’ in preventing playing fields being sold. ‘Without . a minimum requirement, the danger is that short-term expediency could . jeopardise the ability of schools to deliver sport for future . generations,’ he said. Labour . education spokesman Stephen Twigg said: ‘This just shows how out of . touch Michael Gove is. 'Not satisfied with getting rid of the target of . pupils playing two hours of sport a week, he is now weakening the . standards Labour introduced to protect school playing fields. ‘If we are to ensure the Olympic legacy, the Government must ensure that schools provide a decent amount of space for competitive sports and play.’ A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘These regulations set out for the first time that all schools must have access to suitable outdoor space for both formal PE lessons and for outdoor play. ‘By removing pages and pages of bureaucratic restrictions we will make it easier and cheaper to provide the badly needed extra school places that this country needs so urgently. ‘Our extremely strict rules on playing fields will stay firmly in place. This Government has only approved sales if the school has closed, has merged or if equal or better facilities are being put in their place.’","Education Secretary scraps rules forcing schools to maintain specific amount of space for sport .

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:59 EST, 15 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 00:59 EST, 15 August 2012 . Accused: Drew Peterson, 58, pictured in 2009, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio . The judge at Drew Peterson's murder trial on Tuesday lambasted prosecutors who for the third time in as many weeks broached a subject they were told not to mention in front of jurors -- again raising the possibility that the case could end with the judge letting the former police officer go free. Drew Peterson, a 58-year-old retired police officer from Chicago, has pleaded not guilty to murder in the 2004 death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio, which prosecutors believe he had made look like an accident. He was only charged after his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, vanished in 2007. Peterson is a suspect in that case, but has not been charged. Judge Edward Burmila seemed unmoved by repeated apologies by an attorney for the state and said he would rule Wednesday on whether to declare a mistrial in a case beset by problems from its outset. Just two hours before, Burmila had told prosecutor Kathleen Patton not to ask a witness about whether Savio had sought an order of protection against Peterson in front of the jury. When she did, he told jurors to leave the room and berated the prosecutor.'There was one thing I told you not to go into and that's exactly what you did,' Burmila told her. Investigators collected no physical evidence after Savio was found dead in a dry bathtub at her home, and authorities initially ruled that Savio accidentally drowned. But after Peterson's fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, disappeared in 2007, Savio's body was re-examined and her death was reclassified as a homicide. Patton explained that the question was on a prepared list of questions and that she read it inadvertently. 'I'm sorry,' Patton said. 'It's my fault. I can't believe I did it.' During a break, Patton sat in an adjoining courtroom, her shoulders slumped forward, her face buried in her hands, shaking her head over and over. Her boss, Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow, stood a few feet away, his head down. The error came just as the trial seemed to be going prosecutors' way in recent days, with the judge granting them permission to present hearsay evidence central to their case. Grave charges: Peterson is accused of murdering Kathleen Savio, left. It was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the . bathtub, right, but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a . homicide . Hearsay, or statements not based on the direct knowledge of a witness, is not usually admissible in court, but Illinois passed a law – known as 'Drew’s Law' - in the wake of the Peterson case that allows it in certain circumstances. Prosecutors have acknowledged they have no physical evidence linking Peterson to Savio's death, so hearsay evidence about what Savio allegedly said to other people is crucial to their case. The mistake also came as Patton was questioning one of the state's most compelling witnesses so far. Former police officer Teresa Kernc had just told jurors about interviewing Savio in 2002 after Peterson allegedly broke into Savio's home in a SWAT uniform and repeatedly pushed her to the ground. At one point, Savio allegedly told Peterson, 'Go ahead and do what you came to do: Kill me,' Kernc testified.'He said, ""Where do you want it?""And she said, ""In the head.'' ' Kernc testified. Peterson then allegedly told Savio to turn her head, which Savio did, Kernc said, based on what Savio told her. 'And then he said, ""I can't kill you,'' she told jurors. Peterson then threw a garage opener to the ground and left. Blunders: The judge at Drew Peterson's murder trial on Tuesday lambasted prosecutors, namely Kathleen Patton seen here, who for the third time in as many weeks broached a subject they were told not to mention in front of jurors . Shortly after Kernc finished telling that story, Patton turned and asked, 'Did she tell you she wanted to get an order of protection?' The defense objected to Patton's question, and the judge asked jurors to leave the room. Savio hadn't asked for such an order at that point and the judge would have regarded the subject as creating a bias against Peterson, a Chicago defense attorney not connected with the case explained. 'It can affect a jury unfairly because it's a signal that he is a bad, violent person,' attorney Gal Pissetzky explained. Defense attorneys asked not only for a mistrial but for a 'mistrial with prejudice,' meaning Peterson could be set free and never be charged again with Savio's murder. Declaring a mistrial with prejudice is a rare judicial step. Burmila could also declare a more standard mistrial, meaning Peterson would be retried later. In memoriam: Flowers and a small angel statue surround the grave marker of Kathleen Savio, the third wife of Peterson, at the Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois . The judge could also instruct the jury to disregard what the prosecutor said. If he takes that route, it could still signal to jurors that prosecutors have -- again -- messed up, potentially influencing their decision during deliberations.

A series of blunders: Dr Samina Tahseen outside her Fitness to Practice Panel hearing in Manchester . A consultant who removed the wrong fallopian tube from a patient was 'hasty, careless, and dismissive' before, during and after the procedure, a tribunal has found. Dr Samina Tahseen, who botched an operation to remove an ectopic pregnancy and left the woman - referred to as Patient A - unable to conceive naturally, was found to have made a series of errors over an 18-hour period at Royal Derby Hospital. A Fitness to Practise panel, held by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service, found Dr Tahseen’s fitness to practice had been impaired by the misconduct. The finding said the doctor had acted 'against the patient’s interests' and that her actions had 'undermined public confidence in the medical profession'. Dr Nigel Hester, chairman of the panel, said: 'You did not provide good clinical care to Patient A. 'You acted against your patient’s interests and failed to take action when this was brought to your attention. 'The panel is of the opinion that your actions have caused patient harm, have brought the profession into disrepute and have undermined public confidence in the profession.' The panel noted that while she had an 'unblemished career' before and after the incident, Dr Tahseen had 'failed Patient A during each stage of her care and treatment'. It said: 'You were careless in your pre-operative approach, hasty in your intra-operative approach and dismissive of the patient’s concerns in your post-operative approach.' Dr Tahseen admitted to the panel previously that she had not checked which tube contained the ectopic pregnancy and did not correctly identify the tube during the surgery on September 21, 2010. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilised egg begins to develop outside of the womb, usually in the fallopian tubes. The pregnancy can cause life-threatening bleeding if left untreated. Patient A had been trying to conceive for about two years when she fell pregnant but went to her GP when she suffered bleeding. After . initially being told she had suffered a miscarriage and ordered to . rest, the woman went to Royal Derby's Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit . when the bleeding worsened. Doctors . discovered she had an ectopic pregnancy and told her she . would have to undergo surgery to remove the affected tube. Patient A, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was concerned after the operation and challenged what had happened as she had pain in her right side. The patient had previously been told that the ectopic pregnancy had been present in her left fallopian tube. The panel heard that, when challenged, Dr Tahseen said it was obvious that the right side must have had the ectopic pregnancy. Bernadette Baxter, prosecuting, said: 'Dr Tahseen was then told the woman had a cyst in her right fallopian tube - a separate and unrelated issue. She had looked shocked and had asked to see the patient’s notes.' Dr Tahseen did not order further tests before telling the patient to go home, where the pregnancy ruptured. The patient then underwent emergency surgery to have the correct fallopian tube removed, meaning she lost both tubes in three days. The panel will now decide what sanctions will be bought against Dr Tahseen.","Consultant made a series of blunders over an 18-hour period .

The Silversun Pickups want Mitt Romney's presidential campaign to immediately stop the use of the rock group's song Panic Switch. The Los Angeles-based band's attorney sent a cease and desist letter to the Republican presidential candidate's campaign yesterday. A news release says neither the band nor its representatives were contacted for permission to use the 2009 alternative rock hit and the group 'has no intention of endorsing the Romney campaign.' 'We don't like people going behind our backs, using our music without asking, and we don't like the Romney campaign,' Silversun Pickups lead singer Brian Aubert said in the statement. 'We're nice, approachable people. We won't bite. Unless you're Mitt Romney! We were very close to just letting this go because the irony was too good. While he is inadvertently playing a song that describes his whole campaign, we doubt that `Panic Switch' really sends the message he intends.' Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said in an email that the song was inadvertently played during the setup for one event before Romney arrived. Scroll down for video . Silversun Pickups : 'While he is inadvertently playing a song that describes his whole campaign, we doubt that Panic Switch really sends the message he intends,' said the band in a statement . 'Panic Switch,' which seems to be an . indictment of 'red views' that 'keep ripping the divide,' helped the . quartet earn a Grammy nomination for best new artist in 2009 and joins a . long list of songs allegedly purloined by politicians. These types of dustups are nothing new. There was Ronald Reagan's appropriation of Bruce Springsteen's 'Born in the USA.' Tommy . Petty and Michelle Bachmann squared off over 'American Girl.' And John . McCain's campaign ran afoul of a number of acts in 2008, including . Jackson Browne and Foo Fighters. Republican candidates aren't always targeted. Soul singer Sam Moore asked President Barack Obama to stop the use of 'Soul Man' in his 2008 campaign. The band learned about it in a tweet from Romney's North Carolina stopover. 'As anyone who attends Gov. Romney's events knows, this is not a song we would have played intentionally,' she wrote. 'That said, it was covered under the campaign's regular blanket license, but we will not play it again.' Saul says the campaign has licensing agreements with BMI and ASCAP. Silversun Pickups publicist Ken Weinstein says the group and its team don't agree that the song's use is covered. Attorney Tamara Milagros-Butler said she received a call from the campaign's general counsel within about an hour of sending the letter. 'As the former governor (of) the state of Massachusetts, a graduate of Harvard Law School, and candidate for U.S. President, we're pretty sure you're familiar with the laws of this great country of ours,' it reads in part. 'We're writing because we, like you, think these laws are important.' Milagros-Butler said the band is pleased with the result. She said it was important for politicians to respect musicians' rights. 'Hard-working folks like them who have worked for years, and years and years building the value of their copyright' know the law and that they have to be vigilant about their rights, she said.","The Silversun Pickups want Mitt Romney's presidential campaign to immediately stop the use of the rock group's song Panic Switch .

A lifelong baseball fan was blinded after he was smashed in the face by a foul ball when he took his eyes off the field to pay attention to a park employee. Keith Rawlins, 46, was in the stands on July 20 with his 15-year-old daughter after the pair decided to catch the Cleveland Indians play the Baltimore Orioles at Progressive Park, Ohio. As the end of the game drew near, their section of the crowd was asked to leave the field early because of an event. Scroll down for video . Blinded: Mr Rawlins has lost sight in his left eye after being hit in the face with a foul ball at a Cleveland Indians game in Ohio. He underwent ten hours of surgery and was left with medical bills of $56,000 . Mr Rawlins said he remembered hearing the ball hit the bat and then a blinding pain. He told ABC13: 'My face exploded. I knew what happened instantly. I knew I had been hit by a foul ball,” he said. 'It was arguably the only ball I’ve taken my eyes off of in 50,000 in the last 15 years.' The baseball fan fell unconscious in the ambulance and needed ten hours of surgery to reconstruct his fractured eye socket, nose and sinus. He may have permanently lost sight in his left eye. His medical bills have now reached $54,000. However because he was at the start of a new job as a machinist, Mr Rawlins is unsure if his health insurance will cover the extent of his injuries. He also said that he can no longer work in his profession of the past 29 years because of the damage to his left eye. Day out: Mr Rawlins was watching the baseball with his 15-year-old daughter on their way home to Rochester, New York when the incident occurred . Although he has had calls from the Cleveland Indians, they have not offered to contribute to his medical bills and instead offered him a baseball fan pack. The Cleveland Indians did not return calls to the MailOnline today. The team, which has an estimated worth of $410million according to Forbes, says it is not liable for fan injuries. However Mr Rawlins said that the stadium staff put him in a position where he had to take his eye off the ball. He has said that he hoped that the team would support him and get his family back on their feet. He is considering bringing a lawsuit against the Cleveland team. The baseball fan has set up a Facebook page, Make MLB Safe For Fans, to warn others of the dangers of foul balls and to encourage Major League baseball teams to use nets similar to those that protect fans at hockey games.

Universities have been accused of discriminating against pupils who suddenly flourish in the sixth form – especially boys – by using GCSEs to decide which candidates to accept on to degree courses. The heads of some of Britain’s top schools said universities were increasingly relying on the results teenagers achieve at 16 as a crude ‘filter’ to weed out applicants who have similar A-level grades. But they said bright pupils often failed to excel in GCSEs and only reached their full potential at A-level. Universities were accused of relying on the results teenagers achieve at 16 as a crude 'filter' to weed out applicants who have similar A-level grades . Among those that require top GCSE passes for courses is the University of Manchester, which insists those taking its dentistry course need a minimum of six GCSE A grades, while law students need a minimum of five GCSE A grades. The heads’ warning comes as a record number of teenagers scramble to find university places after top A-level grades fell for the first time in 20 years. A drop in the proportion of top grades has also been predicted when GCSE results are unveiled on Thursday. The heads said universities increasingly use GCSE results as ‘a ready reckoner’ as competition for places reaches unprecedented levels. Dr Martin Stephen, former High Master of St Paul’s School in West London – one of the most academically successful fee-paying schools – said universities were forced to use GCSE results to help them select students because they had few other indicators of academic ability. He said: ‘You only get in the pile for consideration if you jump that hurdle. They are a key gateway. But GCSEs were never designed to identify the most able and they don’t do that. 'As an identifier they are not fit for purpose. The use of an exam taken at 15 or 16 is discriminatory because of the late development of boys. Dr Martin Stephen, former High Master of St Paul's School, said it was 'discriminatory' ‘Even more important, really  creative and clever children take risks and make mistakes, and pupils should not lose out because of that.’ Dr Stephen said that while GCSEs were good predictors of academic ability for two-thirds of pupils, for the others ‘they are about as accurate as a clay pigeon shooter trying to hit a clay while facing the wrong way’. David Levin, headmaster of the City of London School, said: ‘There has been a trend for universities, particularly the leading ones, to use GCSEs to distinguish between candidates as competition for degree courses has risen. 'But it discriminates against boys because GCSEs are a recall set of exams whereas in the A-level there is much more independent work. Boys tend to develop later and do better at A-level where there is more independent work.’ The admissions authorities said GCSE results were ‘among the criteria’ universities used, but most leading institutions now tell candidates applying for certain courses that they need to achieve top GCSE passes in addition to their A-levels. At Birmingham University, applicants for its medicine and surgery degree must have at least seven  A* grades at GCSE, and at least A grades in maths and English. In contrast, Cambridge University said: ‘As our research shows, post-16 exam performance is a much better predictor of degree success. We do not have any hard and fast GCSE requirements. Strong performance in Years 12 and 13 can make up for less stellar performance at GCSE.’ UCAS, the body responsible for admissions, said: ‘GCSEs are among the criteria institutions consider.’","Universities accused of discriminating against pupils who flourish in the sixth form .

An estate agent has been jailed after framing an innocent client for speeding in an attempt to escape a driving ban. Noweed Parvez, 36, was caught by a speed camera doing 45mph in a 30mph zone, but tried to shift the blame by giving police the name and date of birth of his customer, Simon Maher. Mr Maher, 35, was convicted of speeding without his knowledge despite the photographs showing an Asian man behind the wheel and Parvez's company logo on the car. 'Horrible nightmare': Simon Maher (pictured) was wrongly convicted of speeding after his estate agent, Noweed Parvez, gave police his details in an attempt to escape a driving ban . The unwitting father-of-four, 35, only discovered the conviction when a policeman contacted him to say a warrant had been issued for his arrest. The former school caretaker eventually won his battle to clear his name after the picture of the speeding VW Golf GTI was fully analysed and the driver was proved to be the company boss who had been looking after Mr Maher's rented property. It emerged Parvez had nine points on his driving licence and feared a road ban under the totting-up procedure. Mr Maher, from Darwen, Lancashire, suffered sleepless nights and weeks of stress. Yesterday, he told of his ordeal after Parvez, of Colne Road, Burnley, admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice and was jailed for 12 months. Mr Maher, who drives a Seat Leon, said: 'He totally abused my trust by using my personal details and I was furious when I found out it was him - I just wanted to go over to the shop and drag him over the counter, but I knew it wouldn’t do me any favours. 'Throughout this, I’ve suffered many sleepless nights, I’ve lost weight because I lost my appetite and I was having anxiety attacks too. It was a very stressful time. 'It was just one blunder after another. Not only was the man in the photo Asian and I am white, but the company logo was written all over the car. I’m glad he’s gone to jail but I wish he’d got more. 'It could have been so trivial, but it turned into a very serious matter and this man roped me into all of it.' 'Suffered anxiety attacks': Mr Maher was finally cleared when it was established that photographs from the speed camera showed an Asian man behind the wheel and Parvez's company logo on the car . Earlier, Burnley Crown Court was told how Parvez was caught speeding in his VW Golf by a speed camera in November 2010. The following month he was sent a Notice of Intended Prosecution but Parvez returned it falsely saying Mr Maher - who paid rent at one of his properties - was driving at the time and gave his date of birth but gave a bogus address in Accrington. A notice was then sent to the fake address and when court officials failed to get a response, Mr Maher and was convicted in his absence by Hyndburn magistrates. Last September, a shocked Mr Maher was contacted by phone by a warrants officer who was stood outside the Accrington house, read his rights - and insisted he attend court with him. Mr Maher said: 'He said he was outside my house, but when I looked and saw there was nobody there. I laughed out loud, I thought it was a wind-up. Simon Maher . 'It was only when a black van pulled up 20 minutes later outside my house and the man showed me his ID that panic set in. I was baffled. My wife and three-year-old boy had come back to the house by then. 'The man explained about the driving offence and when I said I had never owned that make of car, he would not listen. 'When I went to court and pleaded not guilty, the prosecution lawyer said to me I had already wasted lots of money and lots of man hours and that I was in very serious trouble . 'I crumbled at this point. I wanted to wake up and realise this had been a horrible nightmare.' Last November, Parvez was quizzed by police and owned up. He claimed he had panicked as he already had points on his licence, thought he might be in danger of being disqualified and falsely declared Mr Maher was the driver to avoid prosecution. In mitigation, Nick Dearing said: 'He expresses great remorse for the fact Mr Maher had been dramatically inconvenienced and put to much stress. 'At the time of the offence, he had nine points on his licence and he needed his licence for his employment. To protect himself, he gave false details to avoid prosecution himself.' But sentencing, judge Mr Recorder Michael Blakey told Parvez: 'I would be failing in my public duty if I didn’t come to the conclusion it’s so serious that an immediate custodial sentence is justified.'","Noweed Parvez gave police Simon Maher's details after being clocked doing 45mph in 30mph zone .

Seven-year army veteran Rachel Estes, 35, says it was while she and her 5-year-old daughter were returning to North Carolina from South Korea when her 14-pound terrier named Livi got fatally lost in the transit. She says the family's two cats, also travelling with them, arrived in Charlotte a day after the family's arrival, but Livi wasn't there. Killed: A woman flying to the U.S. with her dog Livi, pictured, says veterinarians had to put the pet down after he suffered a heat stroke while in transit with United Airlines' pet care programme . Instead they got a phone call - after four hours of searching for the dog by the PetSafe transportation programme - to say Livi was in Houston, Texas and would be taken to a veterinary clinic instead. 'It took us trying to find [the animals] to even find out that they took the dog to the vet,' Mrs Estes told the Houston Chronicle. Found collapsed in her carrier, according to the dog's medical record, and tangled up in her harness, a veterinarian ruled that Livi had died of a heat stroke. 'She came in with a fever of 108 and was unresponsive,' Mrs Estes said the veterinarian told her. Tragic end: The dog was rescued from a shelter in South Korea by the Army mom before she said he was lost in transit and when found in Houston, Texas, was unresponsive . Responding to the incident, United Airlines has said in a statement that it wasn't responsible for the dog's death. 'We carefully reviewed the details surrounding this incident, and the veterinarian's examination of Ms. Estes' dog showed that the death of the dog was not transit related,' a statement obtained by the Chronicle read. The airline said they would reimburse Mrs Estes for the cost of transporting all three pets. No fault: United Airlines has decided that the dog's death was not transit related and had no fault in the situation, while offering to reimburse the woman for her pets' transportation . 'My dog had to have been so scared and I wasn't there to hold her little paw,' Mrs Estes said of her largest concern over the issue.

Mintoff passed away at his residence near Valletta on Monday, the government said. Known for his confrontational style and fiery speeches, he oversaw the closure of Britain's military base on the island in 1979 - ending the 200-year-old military link.

Police officers stand guard outside the property last night . Joseph Muscat, the current leader of the labour party, said that all the Maltese have been orphaned by Mintoff's death. Mintoff was prime minister between 1956 and 1958 and between 1971 and 1984, when he handed over the reins to his picked successor Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici. He was a member of parliament for more than 50 years and held sway over Malta's political scene before and after its independence from Britain. Born in Cospicua on August 6, 1916, he was the son of British Royal Navy cook went on to marry a Briton. But politically, he looked east and at one stage formed strong bonds with Communist China. Mintoff was also close to former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and promoted a policy of non-alignment and neutrality from the superpowers, often drawing the wrath of the West. Mintoff, who was a member of parliament for more than 50 years, arrives at the electoral commission offices in Valletta on February 13, 2008 . Libyan president Colonel Muammar Gaddafi holds hands with Mintoff after the last Royal Navy warship sailed out of Malta's Grand Harbour in 1979 . The former labour party chief remained a powerful influence after his retirement and brought down a labour government in 1998 after a falling out with then leader Alfred Sant. He also fiercely but unsuccessfully fought Malta's accession to the European Union in 2004. Labour leader Mr Muscat last night paid tribute to Mintoff for bringing in a raft of social reforms including pensions, the minimum wage, free schooling and medical service and a children's allowance. Another central achievement, he said, was enforcing the separation of church and state. Mintoff, who studied at Oxford University, remained a MP until well into his 80s. 1978: Mintoff's daughter Yana, then 26, and John Mcsherry appear outside court after being charged with causing criminal damage. In a protest against the British military presence in Northern Ireland, they hurled three bags of horse manure into the House Of Commons chamber from the Strangers' Gallery during a debate . His death also reminded British MPs of one of the most bizarre breaches of House of Commons security in living memory. His daughter, Yana, as active and confrontational a politician as her father, visited Parliament on July 6, 1978. And as a protest against the British . military presence in Northern Ireland, she hurled three bags of horse . manure into the chamber from the Strangers’ Gallery. It happened during a . debate on Scottish devolution. Miss Mintoff and a male accomplice, were dragged from the chamber and later fined. She had apparently strapped the bags . of manure round her body - even so it is a mystery how this was not . spotted, or even sniffed out, by security officials at the entrance.","Socialist prime minister passed away at his residence near Valletta on Monday .

Exposure to a common parasite hosted by cats could make people more likely to attempt suicide, according to new research. Toxoplasma gondii - which can cause toxoplasmosis - is easily transmitted to humans and has already been linked to a series of personality and behavioural changes. A recent study found that people who tested positive for exposure to toxoplasmosis were seven times more likely to have a history of suicide attempts. Hidden threat? Scientists have linked toxoplasmosis gondii, the parasite hosted by cats and easily transmitted to humans, to a series of behavioural changes . Around a third of people carry toxoplasma gondii, with most catching it by consuming undercooked meat or anything contaminated with cat faeces. Exposure to the parasite can lead to toxoplasmosis, which scientists have already linked to behavioural changes and even the development of schizophrenia. A report in the Atlantic said people infected become more 'expedient, suspicious, jealous and dogmatic'. A study carried out in a Swedish hospital indicated that testing positive for exposure to toxoplasmosis correlated strongly with suicide attempts. A group of 54 patients of both sexes - all with a history of attempting suicide - were assessed for the study, along with 30 control subjects. Scientists used blood tests to determine their history of exposure to toxoplasmosis. The study concluded that both men and women who tested positive for immune responses to the infection were seven times more likely to have a history of 'non-fatal suicidal self-directed violence'. Toxoplasma gondii: Around a third of people carry the parasite, with most catching it through consuming undercooked meat, or anything contaminated with cat faeces . The report in the Atlantic said that identifying toxoplasmosis as a risk factor for suicide could be of benefit in suicide prevention. However it said the evidence of correlation between exposure to the infection and suicide attempts did not mean the relationship was causal, adding: '...by no means do you need to live with cats in order to contract toxo. 'It increases your risk of exposure, but there are ways that even high-risk immune-compromised people can live safely with cats.' Earlier this year Czech scientist Jaroslav Flegr claimed to be a living example of toxoplasma gondii causing schizophrenia. The 63-year-old said he had contracted the parasite, and that it had led him to behave in strange, self-destructive ways. Signs of toxoplasmosis can include mild flu-like symptoms such as a high temperature, sore throat or aching muscles - although the common infection often causes no symptoms at all. It can cause serious complications in people with weakened immune systems. The full study is due to be published in a forthcoming issue of the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.","Toxoplasma gondii is easily transmitted to humans and can cause the common infection toxoplasmosis .

The mother of the girl who was lost in America's second-biggest airport for four hours has revealed that United Airlines had no idea where her daughter was and even told her the ten-year-old had reached her final destination. Phoebe Klebahn was flying from San Francisco to Chicago where she was scheduled to make a connection and fly to Grand Rapids, Michigan, for summer camp. The person responsible allegedly forgot to pick her up at the gate and accompany her to the next flight. Her mother Annie spoke to the Today show about the ordeal and revealed no one at United seemed to know where her daughter was. Scroll down for video . Panic: Annie Klebahn spoke to the Today show about the ordeal and revealed no one at United seemed to know where her daughter Phoebe was . Phoebe said: 'I asked to call my mom as I knew she would be worried about me. But every time I asked them they were like ""hang on a minute, we are too busy""' 'All the worst possible things go through your mind when you have no idea where your child is and she's 2,000 miles away,' she said. 'They actually told me she had arrived in Michigan. So at that point I really knew that they had lost her at some level. They didn’t know where she was.' Phoebe's parents only found out . their daughter had trouble with the airline once a camp counselor called . to say the girl never showed up. She said she was put on hold for almost an hour and when the employee came back on the phone she was told they could not help her because her shift was ending. 'My husband asked her if she was a mother and she said yes,' Mrs Klebahn said. 'And then he asked her, well how would you feel if your daughter was missing?' Phoebe said when someone eventually came and took her to a waiting area, she asked several times if she could call her parents. 'I knew mom would be worried about me,' she said.' But every time I asked them they were like ""hang on a minute, we are too busy"".' Familiar story: Like in Home Alone 2 where the main character is lost in Chicago's O'Hare airport, Phoebe Klebahn missed her flight to summer camp . Multiple mistakes: A friend of the girl's parents told how United did not contact the family until the case gained media attention . The incident became public after a friend of the couple wrote about their trouble with United on his blog, bringing the plight of Annie and Perry Klebahn who tried to understand how their daughter was left to fend for herself in the airport. After an estimated 18 hours of phone calls with United Airlines as they searched for answers, the Klebahns found out that the escorts that the company uses to collect and drop off unaccompanied minors during solo flights are actually managed by a third-party service. In their daughter's case, the representative didn't show up at the gate in Chicago because they forgot about her. On top of that failure, the United attendants who were on the plane were 'busy and could not help' the confused girl as she waited for the escort. 'She asked three times to use a phone to call us and they told her to wait. When she missed the flight she asked if someone had called camp to make sure they knew and they told her ""yes—we will take care of it"".  No one did,' the parents wrote in a letter of complaint to the airline that was reposted on their friend Bob Sutton's blog. 'She was sad and scared and no one helped.' A United spokesperson told NBC News on Tuesday that they have reached out to the Klebahns to apologize, and the airline is redepositing the miles used to purchase the ticket into Perry Klebahn's frequent flier account. The airline is also refunding the $99 unaccompanied minor charge. Concerned parent: Perry Klebahn, a professor at Stanford University, wrote a letter of complaint that went unanswered and estimates that he and his wife have spent 18 hours on the phone over the issue . Maze: Phoebe flew from San Francisco (left) to Chicago (right) where she was supposed to have an employee escort her to her connecting flight, but the person never showed up . The Huffington Post reported that eventually, Phoebe was put on a flight to Michigan four hours later, and because of the confusion her bags were lost and they took three more days to be reconnected with her at camp. Previous career: Before becoming a professor, Perry Klebahn apparently modeled for Gap . On his blog, Mr Sutton tells of how his friend and colleague Perry, who is a professor at Stanford University, has been continually frustrated by United's treatment and dismissal of the gravity of the situation. When on the phone with one customer service representative while Phoebe was still wandering around the Chicago airport unaccompanied, the representative almost hung up saying that she could be of no more help because her shift was about to end. A maternal plea from Mrs Khelban eventually prompted the worker to spend 15 minutes tracking the young girl down herself. Mr Sutton says that United was 'completely unresponsive' until the couple told a local reporter about the incident and she started asking questions. After that pressure, an airline representative contacted them directly and released a statement apologizing for their alleged actions. 'We reached out directly to the Klebahns to apologize and we are reviewing this matter,' United said in a statement to The Huffington Post. 'What the Klebahns describe is not the service we aim to deliver to our customers. We are redepositing the miles used to purchase the ticket back into Mr. Klebahn’s account in addition to refunding the unaccompanied minor charge.'

Israel's existence is an 'insult to all humanity', Iran's president has said in one of his sharpest attacks yet against the Jewish state, as Israel openly debates whether to attack Iran over its nuclear programme. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said confronting Israel was an effort to 'protect the dignity of all human beings'. 'The existence of the Zionist regime is an insult to all humanity,' the president said in an address to worshippers at Tehran University following nationwide pro-Palestinian rallies - an annual event marking Quds (Jerusalem) Day on the last Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. 'Insult to humanity': Iranian president Mahmoud Amadinejad lashed out against Israel in an address to worshippers at Tehran University following pro-Palestinian rallies across the country on Friday . Israel considers Iran an existential threat because of its nuclear and missile programmes, support for radical anti-Israel groups on its borders, and repeated references by Iranian leaders to Israel's destruction. Ahmadinejad himself has repeatedly made such calls, as has Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iran has denied allegations that it is seeking to build nuclear weapons, saying its nuclear programme is peaceful and aimed at producing electricity and radioisotopes used to treat cancer patients. Israel has been carrying on an increasingly public debate about whether to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. The country's official position is to . favour diplomatic and economic measures to persuade Iran to cease its . uranium enrichment programme, but Israel insists that Iran must not be . allowed to obtain nuclear weapons. Israeli . leaders say 'all options are on the table', a clear reference to a . military strike, if they determine that other measures have failed. 'Confronting the Zionist regime': Ahmadinejad greeted demonstrators taking part in an anti-Israeli rally in Tehran . Iran has warned it would hit back at Israel if it is attacked, also threatening to strike at American interests in the region. Ahmadinejad called Israel a 'corrupt, anti-human organised minority group standing up to all divine values'. 'Today, confronting the existence of the fabricated Zionist regime is in fact protecting the rights and dignity of all human beings,' said Ahmadinejad, who sported a black and white scarf around his neck similar to those worn by many Palestinians. Demonstration: Iranians at an annual pro-Palestinian rally to mark Quds Day burn an Israeli and a British flag in Tehran . Pro-Palestine: Demonstrators carrying portraits of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei chant slogans during a rally on the streets of Tehran to show support for Palestine . 'Quds Day' rallies: Demonstrators carry anti-Israeli placards at the rally on Friday, a show of support for Palestinian resistance against Israeli occupation . Demonstrators in Tehran set U.S. and Israeli flags on fire and chanted 'Death to the U.S.' and 'Death to Israel' during a pro-Palestinian rally on Friday. Iran and Israel have been bitter enemies for decade. Khamenei has called Israel a 'cancerous tumour' that must be wiped out. Tensions between Iran and Israel have intensified since 2005, when Ahmadinejad said in a speech that Israel will one day be 'wiped off the map'. The Iranian president has also described the Holocaust, when six million Jews were killed by German Nazis and their collaborators during World War II, as a 'myth'.","President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad addressed demonstrators in Tehran following Pro-Palestinian rallies across Iran .

Developers are 'tricking' councils into giving wind farms planning permission by producing pictures which make turbines look smaller than they really are, a leading architect has claimed. Alan MacDonald, an architect based in Inverness, Scotland, warned that people were being 'misled' because images submitted as part of planning applications were often little more than 'artifice'. He said that, in the most extreme cases, a turbine could be made to look four times smaller than it actually is. Wind turbines look small in the distance in this image - a 50mm panoramic photomontage with a horizontal field of a 28mm wide angle-lens which conforms to Scottish National Heritage's guidance . The turbines appear larger in this picture of the same landscape - a 75mm single frame photomontage which is representative of landscape scale as seen from the viewpoint . His claims raise fears that councillors may approve developments which are far more imposing on the countryside than they expect. Mr MacDonald, a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects, said small changes to the size of the photograph, the angle at which it is taken, the zoom on the camera and how the image is presented could all make turbines appear smaller than they actually are. 'Local people are being misled about the potential visual impact of such large structures,' he told the Daily Telegraph. More than 3,000 wind turbines have already been built on British land, but there are understood to be plans to construct another 5,000. Mr MacDonald said developers commonly used a wide-angle lens and zoom out, providing a wider shot of the landscape. But the wider the angle and the further away the zoom, the smaller the objects in the photograph will look. Mr MacDonald's concerns have been accepted in part by Scottish National Heritage (SNH), which is to review the guidance it provides to developers. Imposing: A view of Europe's largest onshore wind farm, Whitelee Windfarm on the outskirts of Glasgow. There is no suggestion that developers behind the scheme misled planners . A Scottish National Heritage spokesman said: 'We accept some, but not all, of Mr Macdonald’s concerns. 'We don’t agree with the suggestion that developers have deliberately made turbines appear smaller. 'In our view most developers have followed our current guidance, in good faith, and provided good quality visualisations. 'Images are shrunk to make them fit on standard paper sizes. Everyone's experience is evolving in this field and our aim is to improve the guidance to reduce the risk of under-representation in future. 'We will be consulting on revised methodology in the next few months.  This consultation will help determine what changes we will make to the guidance.'","Leading architect claims councils are being 'tricked' into approving turbines .

Mothers with prams and wheelchair users are being forced to make a five-mile rail diversion - because a ramp on a platform was built six inches too low. Network Rail started work on the £1million, 50ft access ramp at Heald Green, in Greater Manchester, last November. But company bosses realised in April a flaw in the design meant it would not sit flush with the pavement on the lane outside. Blunder: Network Rail started work on the £1million, 50ft access ramp at Heald Green, in Greater Manchester, last November but fenced it off when they realised a design fault meant it would not sit flush on the road . The ramp has now been fenced off while the problem is fixed - meaning travellers in a wheelchair or with a pushchair from Manchester cannot get off at the platform. Network Rail has asked Stockport council to redesign and lower the pavement at Finney Lane to fit the ramp. Inconvenient: Now disabled commuters have to stay on their trains to Manchester airport and return to Heald Green on a train that stops at a separate platform with a working access ramp . The £5,000 bill would be paid for by the rail firm. The work is expected to be finally completed by the end of September. Peter Burns, a councillor for Heald Green, said it had been a ‘monumental blunder’ not to get the height of the ramp right. He added: 'It is not rocket science. The road has not moved and the platform has not moved. They have botched the job and want to cobble it up to fix it. 'The Channel Tunnel is over 30 miles long. When the tunnels met in the middle, the heights differed by two and a quarter inches. 'Yet Network Rail and their contractors were six inches out in about 50ft, when you can see both ends. 'I have had numerous calls from residents about this. By the time it is completed it will be almost 12 months without disabled access which is appalling.' Disability Stockport, a voluntary . organisation which assists and supports people with physical . disabilities, has called for Network Rail to give compensation. Speaking out: Peter Burns, a councillor for Heald Green (pictured with local resident Carmel Treverton) said it had been a 'monumental blunder' not to get the height of the ramp right . Kieran . McMahon, from the group, said: 'This is very unfortunate and not . acceptable. They should be thinking about compensating passengers and . making journeys as easy as possible.' Council . leader Sue Derbyshire said: 'The design and construction of the ramp at . Heald Green is entirely the responsibility of Network Rail. 'We . have received a new design from Network Rail to correct the error that . proposes lowering the footway and are now in discussion with the . affected utilities, whose plant in the footway may need diverting as a . result of any lowering of the existing footway level. Angry: Wheelchair users, such as Liz Curran (pictured) are furious about the blunder and want compensation . Kate Snowden, from Network Rail, said: 'We recognise that there was an error made in the design which resulted in the installation of the ramp approximately 150mm low and short of the Finney Lane pavement. 'To resolve this, we have been in contact with the local council with a proposed solution to alter the gradient of the pavement. 'We apologise for any inconvenience that this design error caused and we are working to get it fixed as soon as possible.'","Network Rail started work on the £1million, 50ft access ramp at Heald Green, Gtr Manchester, last November .

He may as well have not worn the balaclava: Not long after this scene is filmed Allan takes it off in full view of CCTV . Not only did staff know him as a regular customer, he had also robbed the place just 10 days earlier. Allan's embarrassing catalogue of errors started shortly after he burst into Martin's newsagent in Abingdon, Oxon, waving the plastic gun. Amazingly, in the pantomime-style raid, he did manage to grab £134.98 from the till. As he attempted to leave the shop, Allan, who was pushing instead of pulling the door, then attempted to kick out the glass panel but toppled backwards into a drinks display, sending bottles skidding across the floor. Baffled store manager Angela Croke, keen to see the back of him, even went to his aid and helped him leave the store on March 2 this year. Allan was picked up by police just three hours after his botched robbery, still on the same street and with his balaclava stuffed in his pocket. When bundled into the police car he burst into tears and said to officers, 'I'm sorry, it's not fair on them - are they all right?' Allan was jailed for three years for this offence last month but new details can only now be released after he was sentenced at Oxford Crown Court for the earlier raid on the same shop. The first robbery took place just before 6pm on February 23, when supervisor Leanne Coe Coxon was preparing to close the store. What a plonker! Allan topples backwards into a drinks display after failing to get out of the door . Flustered he removes the balaclava in full view of cameras in the shop . This time wearing a balaclava for the entirety of the robbery, Allan repeatedly shouted 'Give me the money' while holding an object in a green case as if it were a gun, the judge heard. Allan forced her to hand over £360 pounds. David Rhodes, defending, said his client was a hard-working dental nurse until three years ago when his fiancee left him and he turned to Class A drugs. Judge Gordon Risius did not extend Allan's existing three-year sentence. Last night Detective Chief Inspector Mark Johns said: 'Clearly Allan's actions show that he isn't cut out for a career in crime, due to the way in which he was apprehended. 'He now has time to think about these actions while serving his sentence in prison.'","Staff at the shop knew bungling robber James Allan, 28, as a regular customer .

Iain Duncan Smith (pictured) said rules which allow expats abroad to claim up to £100m in winter fuel payments was 'ridiculous' Iain Duncan Smith last night vowed to fight a ‘ludicrous’ European ruling allowing expats living in warm countries to claim a total of  up to £100million in winter fuel payments. The European Court of Justice ruling means the Government must pay the annual handout worth as much as £300 to up to 444,000 British pensioners  living abroad. The Work and Pensions Secretary is now considering bringing in a ‘temperature’ test so payments would only be made to those living in colder climates. Mr Duncan Smith told the Daily Mail: ‘We will fight these ridiculous rules. The winter fuel payment is about helping British pensioners with heating costs and it is ludicrous we could have to pay more pensioners living in hot countries.’ He added: ‘We will protect taxpayers’ money and bring in a temperature criteria.’ Previously, the elderly could only qualify for the winter fuel allowance if they reached 60 before leaving Britain. Anyone who left Britain before the payment was introduced in 1998 was also excluded. But under the new rules claimants only need to ‘have a genuine and sufficient link with the UK’ including having ‘lived or worked in the UK for most of your working life’. It means that anyone born on or before July 5, 1951, can now make a claim for the payment for winter fuel this year. Any household with a pensioner qualifies for a payment of £200. Those with someone over 80 get £300. In the 2010-11 winter, 72,840 expats claimed winter fuel payments, or WFPs, at a total cost of almost £16million. Under the changed rules, that  figure could be multiplied many times over. There are some 444,000 people living in Europe who receive a UK state pension. Bills to heat the home: Mr Duncan Smith said the winter fuel payment is about helping British pensioners with heating costs . If they were to all claim the WFPs, the annual cost would rocket to almost £100million a year, at a time when the Government is being forced to make unprecedented spending cuts. It is not possible to accurately estimate how many people will receive a payment for the first time as a result of this change, Mr Duncan Smith said, because not all will satisfy the criteria for a WFP. Officials are now looking into how a temperature test might work. Any change in the WFP criteria would require new legislation. There are some 60,000 OAPs  living in France, many of them based in the south where the average temperature in winter can be as high as 57F (13C). Sleeping in hotter climates: A ¿temperature¿ test could be brought in so payments would only be made to those living in colder climates . In parts of Spain, where there are some 100,000 British OAPs, average temperatures in December and January can reach 63F (17C). Many of the expatriates who have moved to such countries are middle-class retired people who have deliberately moved abroad to enjoy a better climate. For elderly people solely surviving on a state pension or small employment pensions the WFP is a lifeline during particularly cold winters. Some £100billion is spent providing benefits for the elderly, and  Mr Duncan-Smith has called for £5billion to be shaved off that total. The Department for Work and Pensions said: ‘It is now possible people living in the European Economic Area and Switzerland may be entitled to Winter Fuel Payment.’","'Temperature' test may be brought in to check climate cold enough .

Former marine, Stephen Gough, 53, received his 18th conviction in 10 years after failing to convince Sheriff James Williamson he had committed no offence by strolling nude near a swing park. Gough was arrested in Dunfermline, Scotland on July 20th, three days after his release from Perth Prison where he spent six years in solitary confinement for previous refusals to put on clothes. Gough arrives at John O' Groats in 2004 after completing a 900-mile walk naked. Over the course of the journey Gough was arrested numerous times . He remained naked throughout a three hour trial at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court at which he denied breach of the peace. Gough, who was was led in handcuffed to a security guards, was given an old brown blanket to sit on, to prevent his naked buttocks making contact with the plastic cushion on the wooden bench seat of the dock. Former marine, 53, who conducted his own defence, was asked by the sheriff to remain seated while cross-examining so his privates were shielded by the court’s low wooden partitions. Sheriff Williamson told him: 'Witnesses don’t need to see a naked man. There is a level of dignity needed in this court.' The court was packed by onlookers as the trial progressed and giggling could be heard as a door to the public gallery was repeatedly opened during the proceedings by people peeping in. Giving evidence, Michellle Solway, 37, said she was driving into Dunfermline about 1.00pm with a 10-year-old girl passenger when she spotted what she thought was 'a hitchhiker with really short shorts'. She said: 'Then I realised he had just a rucksack and shoes on. My passenger was absolutely shocked. I was shocked myself. 'My passenger said he could have covered up with a leaf. Pictured behind bars in the nude: Gough leaving Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court last month. He decided to represent himself rather than have a solicitor at his trial in Scotland today . Lost? Naked rambler Stephen Gough and girlfriend Melanie Roberts. Gough went on trial today accused of committing a breach of the peace . 'I felt it was disgraceful she had to be exposed to that.' In cross-examination, Gough, who chose to represent himself, rather than have a solicitor, asked her: 'What was it about seeing a naked man that was so alarming?' She told the naked inquisitor: 'I feel uncomfortable just now.' The court heard that Gough was also seen by two other girls, aged six and ten. PC David Moffat, 30, said he responded to several calls and arrived to find Gough about 300 metres from a children’s playpark. Gough told him he was trying to get to the Forth Road Bridge. PC Moffat said: 'I told him he needed stay away from populated areas. He said he had been walking for two days and had passed though towns and no police officer had challenged him. 'It was my opinion that he was going to walk past the play area. I told him there were children playing there but he just kept on walking. 'He told me ""a naked body isn’t offensive and there should be no reason to cover it up"".' PC Moffat told Gough if he put some clothes on, he would not arrest him, but would be cautioned and charged and could go on his way. But Gough refused and was taken into custody. Gough pictured in July this year as he arrived at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court after being arrested for walking around naked . He added that as he was led into Dunfermline Police Station, Gough allowed an officer to hold a sheet around him. Gough, of Eastleigh, Hampshire, who denied breach of the peace, submitted he had no case to answer and told Sheriff Williamson that making him get dressed would contravene the Human Rights Act. Crying, he said: 'This is me manifesting my deep belief. I am walking the talk, as the Americans say. 'What I was doing was not alarming, indecent, offensive or harmful so where I was doing it does no matter. 'I am standing up for all of us. We are humans and we are beautiful and we are all the same.' Finding him guilty and deferring sentence for social background and psychiatric reports, Sheriff Williamson said: 'I am satisfied that your state of undress and the direction of your travel - towards the playpark - meant there was a real chance of breach of the peace.' He added: 'During the trial there were points when I was concerned about your emotional behaviour. 'I was concerned if you were in control of yourself. I want someone to look at your mental health. Otherwise you’ll just be sentenced to prison sentence after prison sentence.' Gough came to notoriety during a naked walk from Land’s End to John O’Groats in 2003. He went on to be repeatedly arrested and jailed for walking naked, and refusing to get dressed. Often after being released from prison he was re-arrested at the prison gates for being naked. Gough was remanded in custody until next month’s sentencing hearing.","Stephen Gough received 18th conviction in 10 years after naked rambling .

Melodee Hoffner said she hoped authorities would reconsider the charges against her husband after videos of their three children, aged nine, eight and five, dancing naked were found on his school cell phone by an IT worker.

Emotional plea: Melodee Hoffner defended her husband today after the college football coach was accused of having child pornography on his cell phone in Minnesota . Mrs Hoffner, whose voice occasionally cracked during her statement, said the videos were innocent and that she and her husband were 'in shock' when he was arrested. 'My family does what every family does - we take videos and pictures of our kids in all their craziness.

In the interview with CNN which aired Monday evening, Mrs Romney told of how he helped support her after she was diagnosed with the incurable disease in 1998. 'Even when I was as sick as that he would curl up in the bed with me,' she said, pausing to wipe away tears. 'So, you just knew that that was where he was. It was like he was gonna do anything he could do just to say ""I'm here. You're OK. Just stay right there, and we'll be OK.""'

Wreckage: The grey Ford minivan, driven by an unidentified male, careened into her bedroom wall at the intersection of Kennerly and Barnes at 2.40am . Grief: Relatives mourn outside the family home where Miss Jackson lived with her parents while she attended Wolfson High School . Workers yesterday were taking their time pulling the car from the wreckage in order not to disturb the structure of the bungalow home. Miss Jackson's father, Gerald Jackson told the local news station that the house had been a target for wayward vehicles in the past and as such he had built a barrier in front of his daughter's bedroom. Sadly, though, the cinder block reinforcement was rendered useless on Tuesday when the sound of shattering glass ringing through the house alerted Mr Jackson and his wife to the horrific accident. Miss Jackson told First Coast News that he had always tried to protect his daughter from what he called a 'violent society' but losing her this way was 'unthinkable'. Unthinkable: Gerald Jackson had tried to protect his daughter from the dangerous intersection by erecting a cinder block barrier (left) in front of the house but it too was destroyed in the accident . He also expressed his sadness at how 'unfair' it was that the driver had walked away unhurt, only requiring treatment for minor injuries. Miss Jackson was an excellent grade A student, according to her family, and dreamed of going to nursing school. Teachers and friends from the school could only sing her praises and mourn her loss. 'The girls closest to her, who had sat with her and build up dreams with her, were devastated,' said Sheri Porubski, Miss Jackson's first period teacher. 'The wail was just unbelievable. I don't think I've ever head such mourning.' Adding to Ms Porubski's description of the student as 'exceptional', her second period teacher, Elisabeth Sundrstom, called her 'compassionate' and 'smart'. Tribute: Janay Jackson is missed by her friends and teachers at Wolfson High who talk about a girl who was bright, kind and ambitious . Dreamer: Janay Jackson has been described by all who knew her as a smart, compassionate, grade A student who dreamed of becoming a nurse on day . Friend Mikel Andrews old reporters: 'She was so joyful, so educated. She helped me on many things, math, everything.' Wolfson graduate, Tim Griffin, who had known her since her freshman year said: 'It hit me hard. I still can't believe it.' One woman who unfortunately can believe . it is neighbour Trish Hunt who, like Mr Jackson, knew the intersection . to be dangerous and was well aware of Mr Jackson's self-erected . barricade. '[The . city] never did anything,' she complained. 'So the owner put up a wall . to try to prevent this tragedy, and unfortunately, it happened today.' Danger: The intersection at Kennerly and Barnes had long been known as a dangerous junction and Mr Jackson claims to have complained to the city many times about the safety standards . In tact: Before the accident Gerald Jackson had tried to build a barrier preventing an incident like this as seen outside his daughter's bedroom on the right . District Councilman Don Redman said he had never heard anything about the multiple complaints Mr Jackson claims to have filed. But he offered: 'We will look into it and see what might be needed to make it a safer intersection.' Spokesperson for Jacksonville Public Works, Debbie Delgado, insisted meanwhile that the junction of Kennerly and Barnes 'meets city standard specifications.' Shannon Hartley, Public Information Officer at Jacksonville Sheriff's Department, is still awaiting more information about the driver and the cause of the accident.","Janay Jackson died from injuries at Shands Jacksonville Hospital .

These shocking images show a beloved pet that was tortured by being doused in lighter fuel and set on fire. Cody the Border Collie, only three-years-old, was burnt so badly that its ribs and joints were visible through its charred flesh. The owner of the black-and-white dog, Natalie Agnew, initially failed to recognise her brutally injured pet as it limped home across a field near their home in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Such was the extent of the injuries around the dog's head and body, with most of it's fur burnt off, that Mrs Agnew thought it was a jackal from Belfast Zoo. Horrific attack: Cody the Border Collie was doused in lighter fluid and then set alight, leaving it in a terrible state. Police are hunting for the people who did this. Traumatised: The young three-year-old collie dog was so horrifically burnt it was possible to see its ribs and joints . Brutal : Police believe two teenaged youths, who were spotted in the vicinity, poured lighter fuel over the dog . Police found two bottles of barbecue lighting fluid from a quarry near to the family home in the village of Maghaberry, outside Lisburn City. Witnesses, including one of Mrs Agnew's two young sons, described seeing two boys, one wearing a black hoodie, in the area of the family farm prior to the attack. The Police Service of Northern Ireland are searching for the attackers. It was thought the brutal incident happened at around 9pm on Sunday morning. Cody only made it back home two hours later. The family have been left devastated and face an agonising wait to see if the dog will fully recover from the horrific burns. Mrs Agnew, 36, had just returned from a family holiday in Spain with her husband Martin and their sons, Jake, 6 and Justin, 10, when the attack happened. She said: 'I can't believe anyone would actually do this to such a helpless and innocent dog. I am absolutely disgusted and am worried about what else these people are capable of. Mrs Agnew said the dog had failed to come home when she called it. She added: 'When she didn't come running right away, I walked down the private lane towards the quarry at the back of our house to find her. I saw an animal walking up the field. Cody is examined by vets today after she was set alight over the weekend . Still suffering: Cody looks in pain at the vets today, three days after the brutal attack . Devastated owners: Martin Agnew with his sons Jake, 6, left, and Justin, 10, holding a photograph of their dog Cody as a puppy . 'I began to panic a bit as I wasn't sure what it was. I thought it was jackal which had escaped from the zoo. The animal was struggling to walk, there were bald patches all over it and blood was dripping from its nose.' After realising it was their pet, she said: 'I started shaking like a leaf. 'I couldn't look at her. I called husband out to the garden who gathered her up and took her to the vet.' The vet told the family that due to the nature of the burns it was a deliberate attack. It is thought her son saw the likely attackers after he was watching out of the window and saw two boys who looked about 17-years-old walking towards the quarry. They are thought to have been local. Beautiful dog: Cody as a pup. She was just three when she was attacked on Sunday . Cody is 'as friendly as they come', said friend and international rugby player Ferris . Mrs Agnew said: 'In addition to being devastated by this horrific attack on our dog, my ten-year-old son now blames himself for not calling the dog in earlier. 'He is also petrified of going anywhere alone.' The dog is now in the care of a local vet. The family said they face an anxious wait over the next few days to see if the dog's wounds will heal. Mr Agnew said: 'We're just waiting for news from the vet now to see how she's going to be. 'She's got serious burns and we're being told it'll be three weeks before we know if her fur's going to grow back. 'I've got two boys and they are in bits about this.' A public appeal for information using Facebook and other media to help police trace two young boys has been launched. Irish . Lions rugby player Stephen Ferris, who is a family friend, said the . attack was 'inhumane' and the pet was as 'friendly as they come'. He is one of over 20,000 followers who have signed up to a Facebook group called 'Justice for Cody'. Police are appealing for information.","Cody, 3, was so badly burnt its ribs and joints were visible .

A plane with 180 passengers on board was today surrounded by security forces who mistakenly believed a hijacker was on board. Two F-16 fighter jets were scrambled by the Dutch Defence Ministry to intercept the airbus, which was bound for Amsterdam's Schiphol airport from Malaga. They went supersonic in their efforts to catch up - but when the plane landed, security forces discovered that there was no hijacking, and the confusion was down to miscommunication. The dramatic security operation - sparked when the plane's pilot lost radio contact upon entering Dutch airspace - came on the same day part of the airport was closed due to the discovery of an unexploded Second World World bomb. Scroll down for video . False alarm: Dutch air traffic control became suspicious about the plane when its pilot lost radio contact after entering Dutch airspace. Precaution: Passengers are removed from the Vueling plane after it landed at Schiphol Airport following a scare over a hijacking . Taken away: Passengers are loaded on to buses at Schiphol AIrport after the hijacking scare on the Vueling plane . Builders digging around Terminal C at Schiphol Amsterdam uncovered the device wedged deep underground. It will lead to questions as to how a major airport used by 45 million people a year could have built over a live bomb. The terminal, from which flights . regularly leave for a number of British airports including London City, . was partially closed, with a number of flights cancelled. Just hours later the apparent hostage situation developed. Police said the pilot had failed to make radio contact after entering Dutch airspace, arousing suspicion with air traffic control that the plane had been hijacked. Security staff, ambulances and photographers  - believing this was a hostage situation - surrounded the plane after it landed around 1.5km from the main terminal. Danger: Hours before the 'hijacking' incident a terminal at Schiphol Airport had to be closed after workmen discovered the unexploded WWII bomb . Red alert: An ambulance is seen in front of the passenger plane carrying tourists from Malaga in Spain to Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport . Delays: Flights from Schiphol Airport were affected by the discovery of a World War Two bomb near the airport's main terminal before the hijacking alarm . Dutch military police said at the time: 'The plane has landed at Schiphol. There is a possible hijacking and the police have surrounded the plane. 'We are trying to make contact with the people in the plane.' National broadcaster NOS made phone . contact with a passenger on board who told terrified listeners that the . plane was calm and there was no hostage situation. A . spokesman for Spain's Vueling airline later revealed the reports . that the plane had been hijacked were due to miscommunication between . the pilot and the control tower. Dramatic: An amateur photographer took these photos showing the plane flying into Dutch airspace with the fighter behind it . Catching up: the fighter behind the jet before it landed at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam . The airline said on Twitter on Wednesday . that 'Amsterdam's protocol for security was activated owing to a . temporary loss of communication between the plane and air traffic . control.' The Vueling plane was parked at a remote corner of Schiphol, away from the main terminal, surrounded by security personnel and several ambulances. Early authorities evacuated parts of the airport after workers found the . unexploded bomb, forcing airlines to delay and cancel some flights. The German bomb was discovered buried . underground near the transport hub's busy Terminal C, which handles . flights to most major European destinations, the Dutch Defence Ministry . said in a statement. Schiphol cleared and closed Terminal C, parts of Terminal D and one landing strip, an airport spokeswoman said. A handful of European flights were cancelled, while several dozen were delayed, she added. The 500kg explosive, uncovered during construction work, would be taken to a safe location and dismantled, the ministry said. Stand back: A security guard directs traffic away from the plane, which had 180 passengers on board, after it landed a mile from the main terminal . Security measure: An unexpectedly dramatic day at Schiphol Airport saw a World War II bomb discovered and a hijacking alarm within hours of each other . The bomb is thought to have been . dropped by the RAF or American Airforce during raids between 1940 and . 1944, when Schiphol was used by the German Luftwaffe. There were regular day and night . raids on the then military airbase, especially because the Nazi airforce . could use it to launch raids on nearby countries including Britain. Allied bombs weighing 550lb were regularly dropped, all containing complicated chemical fuses which could trigger at any time. The RAF and USAAF dropped huge . payloads of bombs on Nazi positions all over the Netherlands, as part of . the 2.8million tons used to flatten vast areas of German-occupied . Europe. This figure compares to the relatively small figure of 75,000 tons of bombs unleashed by the Luftwaffe on Britain. Even though the war ended 67 years . ago, ordnance is still found all over Holland, just as it is in . neighbouring countries such as France, and Germany itself. However, it is highly unusual to find a bomb in a heavily populated area like one of the world’s biggest airports. Some 48million people travel through . Schiphol every year – ensuring that questions will be asked as to how . one of its major terminals was allowed to be built on top of an . unexploded bomb. A major inquiry is expected to be launched in to today’s find.

If the freezing water and powerful currents didn't get you then the sharks would. But a 62-year-old grandmother has succeeded where hundreds of the most hardened criminals failed, swimming the treacherous mile-and-a-half from infamous Alcatraz Prison to the shores of San Fransisco Bay. Jacky Portingale, a receptionist from the UK, took on the gruelling challenge during her summer vacation and claimed the waters were far warmer than those around her home town of Bristol. Jailbreak: 62-year-old grandmother Jacky Portingale swims the treacherous mile-and-a-half from infamous Alcatraz Prison to the shores of San Fransisco Bay . The Rock: US authorities claim only one prisoner ever managed to survive the swim from the world-famous American prison in San Francisco Bay . Jacky, who started open water swimming when her son Lee took up the sport, said she prefers to stick to 'little swims' - of up to two miles. The currents in the bay were a problem with Jacky having to be guided back in the right direction by a safety marshal in a canoe after she started to get 'swept away' in the direction of the Golden Gate Bridge. Jacky, who started open water swimming when her son Lee took up the sport, said she prefers to stick to 'little swims' - of up to two miles . But she completed the course in an hour and 16 minutes - somewhere behind son Lee, who clocked just 31 minutes. She said: 'I thought it was a joke at first, I had heard that nobody had ever escaped from Alcatraz, partly because of the currents and the cold. 'I said I was too old for that and . would never do it. But she booked it up and gave it to me as a Christmas . present, so there was no backing out. 'I . had been training at Henleaze Lake in Bristol and when I first went in . there it was ten degrees, so we didn't find it cold at all. They said . 'you're from England, you'll be fine'.' US authorities claim only one . prisoner ever managed to survive the swim from the world-famous American . prison in San Francisco Bay. In 1962 John Paul Scott washed up on the rocks at Fort Point. He was discovered by a group of boys who thought he was an unsuccessful suicide attempt from the Golden Gate Bridge. Would-be escapees who got past the . notorious prison's armed guards, barbed wire fences, sheer walls and . cliffs then had to take on the strong currents and cold temperatures and . even the risk of shark attack. For 29 years Alcatraz prison held some of America's most dangerous prisoners including mobsters Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly. During that time 36 prisoners tried to escape but only one was proved to have made it to the mainland, where he was found suffering from hypothermia, although some people claim another three convicts listed as 'presumed drowned' actually made a clean getaway. Organised swims from the island to the mainland now take place regularly. Those taking part do not have to contend with one of the hazards that faced convicts going into the water - guards firing at them from the island's watch towers. But they are warned to beware of the . strong currents in the bay, where the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers . flow into the Pacific Ocean. Afterwards . Mrs Portingale, who works at Shirehampton Health Centre, and her lorry . driver husband William, 64, enjoyed a holiday to Yosemite National Park, . Death Valley, Las Vegas and Los Angeles. On the night of June 11, 1962, Frank Lee Morris and brothers Clarence and John Anglin climbed through spoon-dug tunnels to escape the 'The Rock', launching themselves into choppy seas on a raft made of rubber raincoats. The fugitives - all bank robbers - were never found despite one of the biggest-scale manhunts in history. Mystery: Clarence Anglin, John William Anglin and Frank Lee Morris, pictured from left to right, escaped Alcatraz on a raft made from raincoats. No trace of them was ever found . Officials claim they almost certainly drowned in the turbulent tides of the 10-mile-wide bay, with their bodies swept out to sea under the Golden Gate Bridge. The legendary prison break, plotted by criminal mastermind Morris, is one of the most intriguing unsolved mysteries of our time and was made into the 1979 film 'Escape from Alcatraz' starring Clint Eastwood. Just like any other evening, prison guards regularly checked on the prisoners on the night of the escape and noticed nothing out of the ordinary. But by morning, the three had vanished, leaving pillows and lifelike papier-mache masks with real hair in their beds. Federal agents, local and state police, coast guard boats and military helicopters scoured the prison complex on Alcatraz Island, then widened the manhunt to the expanse of San Francisco Bay and the surrounding area of Northern California. The fugitives' raft was found on a nearby island but the three were never found. The prisoners had spent months digging through an eight-inch-thick wall in their cell block using spoons and butter knives. They disguised the holes with painted cardboard. On the night of the escape, they squeezed through the tunnels into a utility hallway and then climbed down a drainpipe and through an exhaust vent to the roof. They slid down another vent and scaled two barbed wire fences before launching the raft they crafted using 50 raincoats from the northeast edge of the island.","Receptionist from the UK takes on challenge during her summer vacation .

Tragedy: Sergey Ovchinnikov allegedly committed suicide after his team had a disappointing showing at the Olympics . The head coach of Russia’s women’s volleyball team was found hanged in his hotel room in Croatia after a disappointing Olympics performance. Sergey Ovchinnikov, 43, was at a training camp in Croatia with his team Dynamo Moscow when the tragedy occurred, according to local media. The club's staff went to Mr Ovchinnikov's room after he missed breakfast and found him hanging. Russian Volleyball Federation director general Aleksandr Yeremenko confirmed the news of his death, but said he was unable to provide any further details. Former Russia coach Vladimir Kuzyutkin speculated the alleged suicide may have been a reaction to the poor showing of the Russian women’s volleyball team at the 2012 London Olympics. 'This is so stupid,' Mr Kuzyutkin told RSN radio station. 'He was my friend, my colleague. No one said a bad word about him. Yes, there was a blunder at the Olympics, well, to hell with it.' Mr Ovchinnikov's team entered the Games as one of the favourites but missed out on medals, losing 3-2 in the quarter-finals to eventual champions Brazil. The head coach of the men's volleyball team, Vladimir Alekno, confirmed that the London failure was a huge blow for Mr Ovchinnikov, RT.com reported. 'He took the Olympics very personally,' said Mr Alekno. 'I saw what he was going through and how upset he was after the defeat. He didn’t talk much. Even after victories he was always thinking about something and smoked a lot.' Under pressure: Despite being one of the favourites, Mr Ovchinnikov's team failed to win any medals . Another reason behind the possible suicide may be health problems. Sovetsky Sport reported that Mr Ovchinnikov had recently been suffering from bad headaches. The cause of death has not been officially announced, with the Russian embassy in Croatia is awaiting confirmation from local authorities. 'The information we have is from Russian sources only,' embassy press secretary Boris Pavlov told Interfax. 'Croatian colleagues haven’t reached out for us yet. So the circumstances of the incident aren’t clear to us yet.' The coach will be buried in the Russian city of Yaroslavl, where his wife and two children live. Mr Ovchinnikov led the country’s student squad to bronze at the 2011 Universiade, and was asked to coach the national team the same year. Under his leadership, Russia progressed to London 2012 and earned the first slot in the world qualifiers.","Found dead after missing breakfast at training camp .

South African prosecutors have sparked outrage after charging 270 miners with the murders of 34 of their striking colleagues who were shot dead by police. The mass killing of the strikers at the Marikana mine this month was one of the most shocking incidents since the end of white rule in 1994. And now the arrested miners have been charged under a law dating from the apartheid era that alleges they had a 'common purpose' in the murder of their co-workers. Scroll down for video (WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT) Farewell: Mourners sing and raise their fists in salute as they surround the coffin of Mpuzeni Ngxande, one of the 34 striking miners killed by police . Aftermath: South African protesters lie motionless on the ground as heavily armed police officers check them at the Lonmin Platinum Mine near Rustenburg, South Africa . Live ammunition: Footage shot at the scene clearly shows officers firing live ammunition from automatic weapons and handguns . The African National Congress, whose members used to be gunned down by apartheid police at protest rallies and targeted with draconian laws, has been severely criticised for using similar tactics now that it is in power. President Jacob Zuma has seen his support erode, with his enemies saying he is more interested in getting close to industry and powerful labour groups than miners working deep underground. Zuma, speaking at a congress of the Socialist International on Friday, did not comment on the murder charges. His justice minister, Jeff Radebe, has demanded an explanation. Taking cover: Protesting miners can be seen cowering within the gun sights of an police officer. More than 30 people are reported to have been killed . Surrounded: Police form an armed cordon around strikers. It is unclear whether these miners are injured or lying down for officers to conduct searches . At the centre of violence: The Lonmin PLC mine, near Rustenburg, 100km north-west of Johannesburg, where around 3,000 miners walked out on August 10 over wages. Since then there have been serveal fatal incidents . Under pressure: President Jacob Zuma . 'There is no doubt that the decision has induced a sense of shock, panic and confusion within the members of the community and the general South African public. It is therefore incumbent upon me to seek clarity,' he said in a statement. Prosecutors on Thursday charged the 270 miners, already under arrest on suspicion of murder in a earlier shooting at the mine, with the August 16 murder of 34 co-workers at the Marikana mine of the world's third biggest platinum producer, Lonmin. The 34 were shot in a hail of police bullets in what has been dubbed the 'Marikana Massacre' with videos of the killings broadcast worldwide. Police will not be subject to punishment until the conclusion of a government probe early next year. Common purpose was often used by the apartheid government against blacks to sentence numerous people for crimes committed by only a few. Mosiuoa Lekota, a former ANC cabinet minister and now leader of the COPE opposition party, was imprisoned during apartheid in a case where the common purpose doctrine was invoked. He said the decision to charge the miners was a setback for democracy. Zuma is facing re-election as the ANC's leader in December and poor management of the shooting would strengthen his opponents who see him as running an ineffectual government. He has ordered an investigation into . the responsibility of police, Lonmin and the feuding unions that caused . the strike at Marikana. The panel's report is due a month after the ANC . vote. Zuma has made little . progress on his main policies since taking office in 2009, with . unemployment increasing, corruption perceived to be getting worse and . the gap between rich and poor - already among the worst in the world - . growing wider. Many . striking miners have avoided pointing fingers at Zuma so far, preferring . to criticise Lonmin and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) for not . doing enough to help them. Violence: A mine worker is pictured licking his spear at Lonmins Marikana platinum mine in South Africa, where police opened fire on striking miners armed with machetes and sticks . Bloody scenes: A police spokesman has confirmed that at least 30 were killed in the shooting on Thursday - one of the worst in South Africa since the end of the apartheid era . 'I blame the management of the company. They are the ones who called out the police. NUM is too busy with politics to help us,' said Lazarus Letsoele, a striking miner. But trouble with the NUM could taint Zuma and the ANC, where many of the union's former leaders have taken up senior positions in the ruling party. Legal experts said the charges will likely collapse when a court hears bail applications for the 270 next week. They see the move as a clumsy tactic to prolong the miners' incarceration that is only making an already tense situation worse. Sticks and stones versus bullets: Miners can be seen between police vehicles throwing rocks at officers. Victims on both sides have been killed in recent days . Gun battle: In the heat of the incident, dust flies and police take cover. Water cannon and tear gas had been fired at miners before police opened fire . Police are facing pressure on a . related front. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate, a . government watchdog, said it had received nearly 200 complaints from the . arrested miners who said they had been assaulted and abused while in . custody. Prosecutors said . they invoked the 'common purpose' measure because the miners were at the . scene with weapons and therefore complicit in the killings. Members of the government's Human Rights Commission questioned if prosecutors knew the law. 'It . seems unthinkable that South Africa now with this fantastic new . democracy and Bill of Rights, that the agents of the state are relying . the remnants of apartheid brutality,' said Andrea Durbach, associate . professor at Australia's University of New South Wales.

But these cats and dogs are symbols of hope amidst the devastation wrought all around them by Hurricane Isaac on the Gulf Coast. They are among 181 pets from shelters being shipped to Texas out of harms' way as the elements continue to batter states. The SPCA took 87 cats and 60 dogs from New Orleans in Louisiana after Isaac lashed the area earlier this week leaving a trail of carnage in its wake. Frightened and shaken: A black and white dog looks up from inside its cage as it is moved from New Orleans to Texas with another young dog, right . Refuge: An SPCA volunteer cuddles a puppy being shipped to Texas alongside 180 other pets in order to make room for those being rescued from areas hit by the hurricane . A further 34 cats from the Humane Society in Gulfport, Mississippi were also transferred to North Texas where they will be safe from storms. The pets will be offered up for adoption to new homes. Their places will also be filled with hundreds more creatures expected to brought in to rescue shelters after Isaac rattled the coast with winds swirling up to 80 miles per hour. Maura Davis, the vice president of communications for the SPCA of Texas, said many of the animals were frightened by the storm and that they would be 'nurtured'. She added that there was a 'massive public outcry' after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to make sure that animals were properly taken care of. Spreading threat: Further along the coast, Gulf waters swamp an American Legion fishing pier in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi . Devastation: A house at the corner of N. Miro and Columbus Streets in New Orleans collapsed as Hurricane Isaac hit the area on Wednesday . They developed the transfer system in partnership with centres in Texas to ensure that no pets were allowed to roam the streets. She added that centres in New Orleans . were now 'stretched to the limit' after tghe hurricane. There are around . 300 animals at SPCA centres in Texas. She added: 'All our thoughts are with everyone down on the coast. It's such a scary time for people and animals.' Since . striking land and devastating thousands of homes, Isaac has been . downgraded to a Tropical Storm as its winds dropped to 70 mph. With the . storm creeping along at just 6 mph, as many as 24 inches of rainfall . were expected in some areas. Cats and dogs in cages are loaded into a van for the journey south to Texas. The rescue operation was put in place after a 'massive public outcry' following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . Safety: Workers carry one of the dogs that will be put up for adoption for half the price when it reaches Texas . The storm threatened to flood towns in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana and leaving 730,000 without power. In some part of Louisiana, power could be out for as long as a week. In the first test of the Louisiana levees since the devastating hurricane of 2005, flood water topped a nine-foot-high floodbank in Plaquemines, just 60 miles southeast of New Orleans. It was not one of the levees strengthened following Katrina. As the authorities made preparations . to deal with the large numbers of pets made homeless, search-and-rescue . operations around New Orleans resumed today. Isaac, a slow-moving . Category 1 hurricane when it hit, was expected to weaken into a tropical . depression on Thursday. But . it left a soggy mess across a widespread area and could still bring . heavy rain and floods as it moves over the central United States - where . rain is badly needed - in the next few days. Oil . production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was expected to start ramping up . again, after nearly grinding to a halt as Isaac closed in on Louisiana . on Tuesday. Most energy facilities, including key coastal refineries, . seemed to escape any Isaac-related damage although benchmark Brent crude . was trading slightly higher on Thursday at about $113.25 a barrel. The bewildered face on this dog gives some clue as to the fearful devastation around him. Some 730,000 homes have been left without power since Hurricane Isaac struck on Tuesday . A cat peers out from behind its cage. Hundreds of animals were killed after Katrina in 2005 but there won't be a repeat of that with Isaac .

In St. John the Baptist Parish, northwest of the city, about 3,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes before dawn on Thursday due to storm surges from Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas, authorities said. Local media also reported major flooding in the town of Slidell, northeast of New Orleans. 'We've been working all through the night. We'll continue working all day,' Lieutenant Colonel Mike Kazmierzak of the Louisiana National Guard told CNN. Staff Sergeant Denis Ricou, a Louisiana National Guard spokesman, said about 5,800 troops had been deployed due to Isaac and the number could rise to over 8,000 in the coming days. City officials announced a dusk-to-dawn curfew on Wednesday to help prevent any return of the looting that occurred in New Orleans in the days after Katrina struck in 2005. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu warned that the punishment for a looting conviction is harsh - a mandatory three years' hard labor.

About a dozen looting-related arrests were reported in the city by Thursday morning but the streets were unusually quiet, littered with downed branches, trees and pieces of roofing material. Power remained out through most of the city, while in the historic French Quarter, a few people were out taking down the boards they had nailed up over store windows. Mark Wallace, 52, had come out to check on his store, Fancy Boutique. 'This one just took forever,' Wallace said of the slow-moving storm, which has brought rain to New Orleans since late Tuesday. 'Usually they blow through and are done with.' Wayne Overton, 50, a longshoreman, had come out to inspect a large, fallen tree in front of his home that had knocked down power lines. 'This one lasted a while. It was scary,' Overton said, noting that the storm had damaged the roof of his home, near the city's port. 'There's going to be a lot of clean up to do around here.' As the focus on Isaac shifted from the coast, many in its projected path further north have been praying that it will bring rain desperately needed to ease a drought in the central states, where summer crops are drying up and many rivers and dams are critically low. Isaac never came close to the power of Katrina, which was a Category 3 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale when it smashed into New Orleans on Aug. 29, 2005. But U.S. President Barack Obama still declared the impact on Louisiana and Mississippi major disasters and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. City officials also said Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, which closed late on Monday, would remain shut on Thursday until repairs can be done to the damaged lines that supply it with power. A tow-truck driver died early Thursday after a tree fell on his cab while he was trying to move a large tree from a main street in Picayune, a town in Pearl River County in southern Mississippi near the Louisiana border, according a spokesperson for the Pearl River Emergency Management Agency. Together with an unconfirmed death in a Louisiana apartment fire, it was the only fatality blamed on Isaac so far.","Pets being shipped to Texas to make room for more frightened creatures rescued from Louisiana and Mississippi .

An Amish woman and her brothers cut the hair of her parents in Ohio to help them get to heaven the woman has claimed while taking the stand at the trial of 16 breakaway Amish members. The woman told jurors overseeing the hate crimes trial that her siblings had been worried that their parents were drifting away from their religion. She says they piled into a van and drove two hours last October to take her father's hair and beard as well as her mother's hair to help them. Taking the stand: Amish women are seen leaving the U.S. Federal Courthouse on Tuesday, two days before a jury heard testimony by one who claims they cut off her parents' hair after the couple strayed from their religion . Prosecutors say what happened in five hair-cuttings in eastern Ohio last fall amounted to hate crimes because they were motivated solely by religious disagreements. The government says the suspects targeted the hair and beards of Amish people because of its spiritual significance in the faith. The claims came amid further testimony that intensified when a woman took the stand to accuse an Amish bishop of forcing women in their settlement to have sex with him. The allegations against Samuel Mullet Sr, also accused of orchestrating the hair-cutting attacks, say he forced married women to have sex with him so he could turn them into better wives, one of the women testified. Crimes: Prosecutors say the five hair-cuttings of men's beards and women's hair in eastern Ohio last fall were hate crimes because they were motivated solely by religious disagreements . The woman said what started out as hugs turned into kisses and then sex. She said she resisted at first. 'He would say things like `I can't understand why you won't obey me, the other ladies can,'' the woman testified. 'I always gave up. I was afraid not to.' Prosecutors say the alleged sexual 'counseling' of married women shows the control Mullet had over followers at the Amish settlement he founded two decades ago. The 16 people accused of carrying out the hair-cutting attacks last fall all lived on Mullet's settlement in eastern Ohio near the West Virginia panhandle. The government contends that the hair cutting was motivated by a religious dispute between Mullet and other Amish bishops who had sought to limit his authority. Those accused of planning and taking part targeted the hair and beards of the Amish because of its spiritual significance in the faith, prosecutors said. Arrests: These five men, along with reputed Amish breakaway sect leader Sam Mullet and Emanuel Shrock, were arrested by the FBI and local sheriff's deputies last fall on federal hate crime charges . Mullet has denied any involvement. Sexual force: A woman testified that Samuel Mullet Sr, pictured, accused of orchestrating the hair-cutting attacks, forced married women to have sex with him so he could turn them into better wives . His defense attorneys had tried before the trial began to bar any testimony about the alleged sexual 'counseling.' They argued that there was no proof of such sexual conduct and that mentioning it would be highly prejudicial. U.S. District Court Judge Dan Aaron Polster told jurors after the woman took the stand that Mullet was not charged with any sex crimes and that they could only consider the testimony as it relates to charges in the indictment. The woman said her husband had a mental breakdown in the summer of 2008 and was in the hospital when Mullet suggested that her husband's trouble stemmed from dissatisfaction with his marriage. Mullet told her he wanted to help the couple with marriage counseling, and she agreed to his request to move in with him, she said. At first, he wanted hugs, from her she said, adding that she learned he had asked the same of other women. 'Next we had to kiss him or maybe we had to sit on his lap,' she said. 'I'm not sure what was first.' Even . asking for a hug was a startling request, she said, in a community that . values modesty and is deeply religious. Amish women in the most . conservative churches traditionally wear long dresses, bonnets over . their hair and frown upon drawing attention to themselves. She went along with Mullet's wishes because she thought it would help her husband, she said. Refusal: After refusing Mullet's sexual advances, the woman testifying said that she moved her family out of the Amish settlement and to Pennsylvania (Lancaster County pictured) One evening after moving into Mullet's home, another woman came to her and said that he wanted to see her in his bedroom, she said. She said she refused, but Mullet was insistent. The woman said she moved out of the house after about two months when her husband returned to the settlement, but she continued to see Mullet at his home. 'I was afraid not to go,' she said. The woman said she finally told Mullet a month later that it had to stop. He called her a whore, she said. The woman and her husband soon left the Amish settlement where they had raised their children and moved to Pennsylvania. We just took our children and a few suitcases with our clothes,' she said.","One of 16 Amish members on trial claims she and her siblings cut her parents' hair because they were drifting away from their religion .

Demands: Russian leader Vladimir Putin has called for an overhaul of the country's military hardware . Vladimir Putin has ordered the modernisation of Russia's armaments on the same scale as achieved by Stalin at the height of his reign of terror. The Kremlin leader made clear he was tired of Western jibes about the country's outdated firepower as displayed at annual Red Square parades. He is even thought to have reference the former dictators era as he told top security officials: 'We must modernise our defence industry as comprehensively as it was done in the 1930s.' He rapped his defence chiefs for failing to draw up plans to meet his ambitious demands for a giant leap forward in Russia's military capability which has slipped since the end of the Cold War. Stalin developed Soviet firepower in the 1930s after revolutionising the country's outmoded tsarist-era industry. But his ruthless state-controlled campaign was based on repression on a grand scale by the secret police and use of slave labour. Outdated: Putin has become angry at the state of defence technology, which go on show every year during the parade in Red Square . Putin has committed Russian to . spending £450 billion on a massive armaments programme in the next . decade, a modernisation that will include 400 ballistic missiles, 600 . warplanes and a new fleet of state-of-the-art submarines. As when Stalin began the process, it is . far from certain that Russia's defence industries can cope with the . demands of matching Western models at a cost-effective price. At a well-flagged meeting of the Russian Security Council, Putin blasted ministers for failing to draw up plans to meet his targets. Stalin: The demands made by Putin compare the modernisation programmes launched under Stalin . 'I still have not received your proposals. They are simply not there,' fumed the Russian president. 'If this continues, we will never be able to make procurements on time.' He even threatened to inject private enterprise into defence plants that have been under strict state control since Stalin's time. He said: 'We have to break down old . stereotypes of the type that say only specialised state companies and . agencies can involve themselves in defence.' Highlighting his impatience on the . subject, he added: 'Within short deadlines we should upgrade production . funds and carry out technological modernisation at enterprises in the . defence industry.'Putin admitted that Russian manufacturers had failed to keep pace over the past three decades and even acknowledged Russia may require foreign technology in order to catch up. Potential for partnership: Putin, seen here with British Prime Minister David Cameron, has said that foreign partnerships should be considered . 'Foreign partnership is possible,"" he said, adding it was 'not shameful' to draw on overseas experience. 'But creating plants which assemble the analogues of foreign arms and hardware using imported component parts is unacceptable,' he insisted. Western military experts have in recent years regularly decried that lack of modern Russian firepower shown at the annual Red Square parade on May 9 marking the end of the Second World War.","Has ordered the overhaul after jibes from the West .

At the end of the first week of school the teenagers poured into the crowded suburban discotheque by the dozens, leaving their backpacks at the door. They rushed onto a dance floor covered in shoulder-high soap suds and started shaking their hips, some grinding against each other in the sexually suggestive dance that is the trademark of this city's newest youth craze. Thousands of lower-income Mexico City teens have become obsessive imitators of a Puerto Rican subculture based on garish street fashions and the throbbing blend of reggae, hip-hop, and Latin music called 'reggaeton.' Nearly every weekend for more than a year, youths known as reggaetoneros have amassed by the hundreds in metro stations before heading off to dance at clubs or clandestine parties, taking over entire subway cars and singing their favourite songs as loudly as possible. New craze: Youth known as 'reggaetoneros' dance at a discotheque in Ecatepec, in a suburb of Mexico City. Thousands of lower-income Mexico City teens have become obsessive imitators of a Puerto Rican subculture . Lost cause: Left, a 'reggaetonero' and a follower of St. Jude, the Catholic saint of lost causes, poses for a photo near the San Hipolito church in Mexico City, right, two more 'reggaetoneros' Ready to party: Young women known as a pose for a photo outside a discotheque in Ecatepec, in a suburb of Mexico City . But Mexico City, a bastion of liberalism in a conservative country, is showing little tolerance for poor, raucous youth imitating a foreign subculture most have seen only on the Internet. Reggaetoneros are increasingly being met with open hostility and even violence. Last month, hundreds clashed with police after a party was cancelled in the downtown nightlife district called the Zona Rosa because more people showed up than could fit into the bar where it was being held. Authorities said that as many as 600 angry youths who couldn't get into the club went on a rampage at local subway stations, damaging turnstiles and streetlamps. Police detained 200 of the young people. None were charged, and they were released within a day. Two weeks later, reggaetoneros gathering at the Chabacano metro station were assaulted by a group of young men who had planned their attack on Facebook. Surveillance cameras caught more than a dozen young men kicking a prone reggaetonero and whipping him with their belts. The Facebook page was one of at least a dozen launched in the last year that urges people to kill or beat up reggaetoneros. YouTube videos ridicule reggaeton music and the way its fans dress. Night at the club: Large glasses and brightly-coloured clothes are all part of the trend... ...and for men, hair in cropped bowls or gelled mohawks are allt he rage, as are wide-brimmed baseball caps . Many of the attackers are members of porros, descendants of informal student groups created by the government in the 1960s to quell student uprisings. Today, they have transformed themselves into youth gangs that operate out of high schools and universities, where authorities have limited powers to enter. A member of one porro group, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal, said the groups have beaten up reggaetoneros on at least four or five occasions because 'they feel superior and are acting like the metro stations belong to them.' Sociologists say, however, that reggaetoneros are being stigmatized because they come from rough neighbourhoods and because of the way they dress. Dance dance revolution: The teens dance at a discotheque in Ecatepec as dry ice machines spray mist into the club . Craze: Teens shaking their hips, some grinding against each other in the sexually suggestive dance that is the trademark of this city's newest youth craze . Mexican reggaetoneros of both sexes tend to tweeze their eyebrows and wear skin-tight, neon-coloured pants, loud jewellery, thick-framed eyeglasses and bedazzled baseball caps worn sideways. The boys wear their hair in cropped bowls or gelled mohawks. Girls dress in tight, spangled tops, their bangs gelled to their foreheads. The sexually explicit lyrics of reggaeton and the music's iconic dance move known as 'perreo,' or dancing doggy style, has also made them a target. A Facebook page that describes reggaeton as 'grotesque, stupid noise that obstructs neurons' calls on people to 'end with that horrible plague' and to kill reggaetoneros 'for your country.' Jose Antonio Perez Islas, who coordinates the youth research seminar of Mexico's National Autonomous University, or UNAM, says the kids just want to have fun. Sweet beats: Carlos Alvarez, 17, records a reggeaton tune in a makeshift home recording studio in Mexico City . Producing: Osvaldo Tejeda, 19, monitors in the makeshift home recording studio . 'These types of groups are the only outlet these youths have to socialize,' said Perez. 'Most don't go to school, and many work in the informal economy; their families are in total crisis and most have to socialize on the street and in groups.' While reggaeton has been popular in Mexico for at least seven years, reggaeton fans began forming clubs, or combos as they call them, on Facebook about two years ago, when the groups began showing up at subway stations they picked as a gathering point. 'They plan to meet in known places because most don't know the city and they accompany each other to get to the (party) venue because in a group the trip is safer,' Perez said. With clubs with names like 'Class and Style,' 'Gum Poppers,' 'Hit Men,' 'The Family,' and 'The Danoninos' - after the yogurt brand - the teenagers post photos of their outings, exchange music, gossip and news about upcoming dances.

She dropped out of high school to help her ailing mother and now works three days a week at a quesadilla stand, earning $11 a week for her work. Last year, a friend invited her to join the Liverpool combo and she did because it was free and reggaeton nightclubs often give a discount on the $2 to $4 cover charge when people arrive in a large group. 'For me, it's a way to clear my mind for a while, to have fun,' said Gomez. But for Christopher Rodriguez, a 17-year-old high school student, those clubs may be a thing of the past. He used to belong to a club that often met at a metro station about an hour's subway ride from the capital's downtown. Because of the negative attention, many of the teenagers are now trying for a lower profile, preferring to travel in small groups to their dances. And Rodriguez has opted to forego the clubs altogether.

Pakistani authorities have arrested a Muslim cleric for the suspected set up of a young girl, reported to have Down's Syndrome, accused of burning pages of a Koran. Religious and secular groups worldwide have protested over the detention of the young Rimsha Masih, thought to be 11-years-old, arrested after furious Muslim neighbours said she charred pages of the Islamic religious text. She may have moved a step closer to freedom after police arrested Khalid Jadoon on suspicion of planting evidence to frame the Christian girl, who was taken into custody earlier this month under the country's controversial anti-blasphemy law. Scroll down for video . Police escort blindfolded Muslim cleric Khalid Jadoon as he is brought before a judge at a court in Islamabad today accused of framing the young girl . A Pakistani policeman reprimands Islamic cleric Hafiz Mohammed Khalid Chishti after he attempted to shout slogans upon his arrival at a court in Islamabad today .

Jadoon, appeared briefly in court today before he was sent to jail for a 14-day judicial remand. A bail hearing will be held on Monday for Masih, whose case has re-focused a spotlight on Pakistan's anti-blasphemy law. Last week Pakistan's president Asif Ali Zardari . said he had 'taken notice' of the reports of the arrest and asked . Pakistan's interior ministry to present a report to him.

Niazi said that when the girl was brought to . the police station she was scared and unable to speak normally, but he . did not know whether she suffered from mental health issues. Under the law, anyone who is found guilty of speaking ill of Islam and the Prophet Mohammad faces the death penalty. Today's arrest has sparked protests from Pakistani Christians in support of Rimsha Masih . Activists and human rights groups say vague terminology has led to its misuse, and that the law dangerously discriminates against the Muslim country's tiny minority groups. Critics of Pakistan's leaders say they are too worried about an extremist backlash to speak out against the law in a nation where religious conservatism is increasingly prevalent. Convictions are common, although the death sentence has never been carried out. While most convictions are thrown out on appeal, mobs have killed many people accused of blasphemy. Masih's arrest triggered an exodus of several hundred Christians from her poor village after mosques reported over their loudspeakers what the girl was alleged to have done. Christians, who make up four percent of Pakistan's population of 180 million, have been especially concerned about the blasphemy law, saying it offers them no protection. Convictions hinge on witness testimony and are often linked to vendettas, they complain. In 2009, 40 houses and a church were set ablaze by a mob of 1,000 Muslims in the town of Gojra, in Punjab province following reports of the desecration of the Koran . At least seven Christians were burned to death during the attacks. Two Christian brothers accused of writing a blasphemous letter against the Prophet Mohammad were gunned down outside a court in the eastern city of Faisalabad in July of 2010.","Young girl was arrested earlier this month under Pakistan's controversial anti-blasphemy law .

A headteacher who used school funds to pay for a trip to China, tickets to a Cliff Richard concert and for loans totalling more than £50,000 to herself and staff has been banned from the classroom. Patricia Black, 64, was handed a Prohibition Order by Education Secretary Michael Gove banning her from teaching for at least the next years - effectively ending her 40-year career. A Teaching Agency disciplinary panel found her guilty of 'unacceptable professional conduct' while head at Chantry Special School, in Falling Lane, Yiewsley, after a string of financial irregularities came to light when the London Borough of Hillingdon carried out a routine audit in May 2010. 'Unnecessary and excessive': Headteacher Patricia Black has been struck off after using £50,000 of school funds to pay for tickets to see Cliff Richard (above) at Wembley, a trip to China and loans for her staff . The panel also found that Ms Black failed to properly declare conflicts of interest when employing her daughter and son at the school and giving her brother a role as a co-ordinator. It said 'the need to be open and transparent and make declarations became more acute once the family members had received loans paid from school monies'. It said that, after employing her son, Stephen Black, she paid him a higher-than-normal salary. The panel found that she inappropriately transferred monies to the school’s private Voluntary Fund from the School Grant account, which included sums received from other London Boroughs for the education of particular children that should have been used for the benefit of those pupils or retained in the school budget. It found that she then used Voluntary Fund money - intended for the sole purpose of benefiting pupils - for staff social activities on several occasions, including for various meals and almost £500 for her and the school’s Business Manager, Ann Bennett, to attend a Cliff Richard concert at Wembley on November 11, 2008 and stay at a hotel in Regent’s Park. 'Significant breach of trust': Black was caught out when the London Borough of Hillingdon carried out a routine audit of Chantry Special School (above) in 2010 . Finding that she also used school money, including from the Voluntary Fund, for a trip to China for herself and Bennett, it described the various expenditure as 'unnecessary and excessive'. It also found that she inappropriately managed the school budget by giving herself loans totalling approximately £20,000, including a sum of £5,000 from the Voluntary Fund. She also gave a number of loans to other staff, including £20,000 to one to buy a car and sums to others of £5,000, £1,000, £3,200, £550, £500 and between £1,500-2,000. Giving the decision on the Secretary of State’s behalf, Teaching Agency deputy director Alan Meyrick said: 'As headteacher, Ms Black was in a position of trust and her behaviours represent a significant breach of that trust. 'The Panel recognised that, until her misuse of school monies and abuse of position as a head teacher was uncovered, the teacher had a long unblemished career. Further, it was conscious that it received no evidence regarding the standard of her teaching. 'The panel recommends that Ms Black be prohibited from teaching and I concur with that recommendation.' He added that the conduct was so serious that she should be ineligible to apply to be restored to the teaching register for ten years, by which time she will be past retirement age. The decision means that she is prohibited from teaching in any school, Sixth Form College, relevant youth accommodation or children’s home in England. She has a right of appeal to the High Court within 28 days.","Patricia Black, 64, found guilty of 'unacceptable professional conduct' by disciplinary panel .

Fresh questions about Britain’s role in Afghanistan were raised last night after commanders suspended the training of the country’s police militia amid fears it had been infiltrated by the Taliban. Military chiefs took the drastic step in response to a rise in the number of murderous ‘green on blue’ attacks – where foreign troops have been killed by Afghan policemen or soldiers. Rogue members of the security forces have carried out 34 attacks this year, killing 45 coalition troops, including seven British servicemen – a quarter of the UK’s 31 war dead since January. Criticism: Fresh questions about Britain's role in Afghanistan were raised last night after commanders suspended the training of the country¿s police militia amid fears it had been infiltrated by the Taliban . Building up the Afghan National Security Forces is the key plank of Nato’s strategy for withdrawal of combat troops. International soldiers are training and mentoring Afghan forces so they can assume responsibility for the country’s security by the end of 2014. It means that Nato soldiers must work closely with the Afghan police they are training. Plan: International soldiers are training and mentoring Afghan forces so they can assume responsibility for the country's security by the end of 2014. It means that Nato soldiers must work closely with the Afghan police they are training . This requires them to live, sleep and go on patrol together. But it involves a huge amount of trust, and this has been slowly eroded by the shocking rise in the number of ‘green on blue’ attacks. There are 9,500 British troops in Afghanistan. The suspension of training currently only applies to new recruits to the Afghan Local Police (ALP), a militia set up two years ago by US forces in villages where the Afghan National Police – a separate body trained by Nato – is weak. But the ALP has been beset by allegations of abuse and widespread corruption. It is also believed that insurgents had infiltrated the organisation in order to carry out insider attacks. US . commanders said they would temporarily suspend training of around 1,000 . new ALP recruits and re-vet members currently belonging to the . 27,000-strong security force. In July, Warrant Officer Class 2 Leonard Perran Thomas, 44, (not pictured) from the Royal Corps of Signals, Guardsman Craig Roderick, 22, (centre) and Guardsman Apete Tuisovurua, 28, right) of the 1st Battalion the Welsh Guards, were killed in a 'green on blue' attack . And the sale of Afghan army and police uniforms will be made illegal so they are less likely to fall into Taliban hands. Colonel Thomas Collins, spokesman for US forces in Afghanistan, said: ‘While we have full trust and confidence in our Afghan partners, we believe this is a necessary step to validate our vetting process and ensure the quality indicative of Afghan local police.’ He insisted the suspension of training would be ‘temporary’.But Labour MP Paul Flynn, said the decision was yet another reason to bring British troops home. He said: ‘It’s about time we realised we are funding, arming and training our future enemies and it is only because of our misplaced optimism that we have got ourselves into this situation. There is no reason why Afghan police officers will put their own lives on the line to serve their corrupt president, let alone a foreign power. They are, however, very happy to take the enormous sums of money we have invested in the country. ‘We are in a terrible situation with politicians trying to spin an end to the war in a good light. The timetable for the end of the war is designed entirely for election purposes. ‘Canada and the Netherlands, who have both made great sacrifices in Afghanistan, have brought their troops home. There is no reason why we shouldn’t bring ours home now – independently of US troops.’ The Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police, trained by Nato forces including British troops, are not affected by the suspension. The training of Afghan special forces will also continue. On average, 7,000 Afghan soldiers and 3,700 Afghan police graduate from training every month. Around 130,000 Nato troops are fighting insurgents in Afghanistan alongside 350,000 Afghans. The ALP have been to blame for a number of green-on-blue attacks, but more come from the regular army and police force. Re-vetting the national police and the national Army would be an enormous task. The coalition forces said they believed that 25 per cent of this year’s attacks had confirmed or suspected links to the Taliban. Sometimes insurgents have infiltrated the ranks of the Afghan army and police but in other cases the Taliban has coerced legitimate members of the Afghan forces to turn their guns on foreign troops. Intelligence reports have highlighted ‘deep concerns’ that one in ten recruits were vulnerable to being turned by the Taliban.","Military chiefs took the drastic step in response to a rise in the number of murderous 'green on blue' attacks .

Cherie Blair attacked Jacques Chirac like an 'Exocet' missile in a verbal slap that won London the 2012 Olympics, architect of the Games Lord Coe said today. In an onslaught on British cuisine the former French president had said 'you can't trust people who cook like that' so the furious Mrs Blair went at him 'like a banshee' on the eve of the key 2005 IOC vote in Singapore. In his new autobiography Lord Coe says her intervention 'played straight into our hands' and forced Chirac to scurry away from a party where he was due to lobby for the Paris bid, allowing him to fight London's case unhindered. 'She won it for us': Lord Coe says Cherie Blair went for Jacques Chirac after he criticised British food, forcing him to leave a party and allowing Seb to lobby people to vote for London 2012's bid . Chirac had joked with Russia's Vladamir Putin and Germany's Gerhard Schroder about the standard of British cuisine at the G8 summit at Gleneagles, because they were going to be fed haggis. 'You can't trust people who cook as badly as that. After Finland it's the country with the worst food,' he said, prompting Cherie to give him a verbal battering when they met in Singapore in July 2005. In 'Running My Life,' which is serialised in The Times, Lord Coe said: 'I spotted Cherie heading like a heat-seeking missile towards the French contingent. Above the hubbub her voice rang loud and clear ""I gather you've been saying rude things about our food"", at a volume that would have done justice to a packed courtroom.' Happier times: Cherie Blair is cuddled by Jacques Chirac while Bill Clinton holds Leo Blair as Tony Blair looks on - but Chirac and Cherie did not always get on so well according to Lord Coe . Looking shocked Chirac then replied 'do not believe every-zing you read,' before Mrs Blair 'got stuck in' and berating him again said: 'I didn't read it. I saw it on television.' Meanwhile Tony Blair, who was stood with Seb Coe turned away and then told him that when his wife 'says something she really means it.' Lord Coe went on: 'She was at him like a banshee and he couldn't get out of that building fast enough. Chirac had met nobody who really mattered.' Paris had been in pole position to win the 2012 Games, way ahead of London in terms of IOC support, but after an incredible effort by David Beckham as well as other politicians and British sportsmen, London beat its French rival by 54 votes to 50 - with two crucial votes from Finland, who had also been attacked by Chirac days earlier. Team: Tony Blair and Cherie arrive in Singapore where London upset the odds and unexpectedly beat Paris to win the Games . Battle: Cherie Blair (pictured in Singapore in 2005) screamed at Chirac 'like a banshee', Lord Coe says . There were reports about Chirac’s mistake across all French media, including TF1, the main national TV channel. Cherie Blair's verbal crushing of Jacques Chirac took seven years to come out, but it is another example of her appetite for a good row. Earlier this year she launched an astonishing . attack on stay-at-home mothers, warning that it was 'dangerous' for women to . rely on their husbands. Mrs Blair went on to criticise 'yummy mummies' who marry rich men and put their energies into raising children rather than . concentrating on their careers - and was accused of 'bullying' women who stay at home. 'One of the things that worries me now is you see young women who say, “I look . at the sacrifices that women have made and I think why do I need to bother, why . can't I just marry a rich husband and retire?” and you think, how can they even . imagine that is the way to fulfil yourself, how dangerous it is,' she said. Previously she also accused men of being more . selfish than women when it comes to spending money, saying they are more likely to spend cash on themselves rather than on relatives or within the . community and also said that even Tunisia had done for equal rights for women than Britain had. Le Parisien newspaper ran the headline: ‘Paris favourite for the 2012 Olympics before a Chirac joke about British cuisine’. The website of France TV meanwhile carried the story using the words:  ‘Chirac lost the 2012 Olympics for Paris’. The French capital had invested . millions into its dream of holding the games this year – even printing . Metro and other transport maps with Olympic symbols. Paris was absolutely convinced it . would beat London but the plodding Mr Chirac did not share the . enthusiasm of his more dynamic countrymen. Two years after the debacle he gave up the presidency, and was then indicted on corruption charges. Chirac, who regularly attacked . Anglo-Saxon culture and complained about English being the world’s . number one language, was in December given a suspended prison sentence. Despite all this he remained a . relatively popular figure across France – something which is likely to . change following today’s astonishing revelations. When London won Lord Coe says he wondered whether he had heard the result correctly while members of the IOC were equally shell-shocked, he said. But their unbridled joy was incredibly short-lived as the next day they were told suicide bombers had attacked the London transport network and killed 52 people. 'In the space of five minutes we had gone from elation to dumb incomprehension and horror,' he said.","Mrs Blair verbally attacked the then French president on the eve of the crucial 2005 Singapore vote, forcing Chirac to leave a party without properly lobbying for rival Paris .

No . regional opt outs. The 24-hour strike by the National Union of Journalists is the second . in a matter of weeks in protest at compulsory redundancies at the BBC . World Service and BBC Monitoring following cuts in government funding. The union said early reports were that the strike was being 'solidly supported' by the 3,000 NUJ members at the corporation. But an email from the BBC's business operations director, Lucy Adams, said six out of seven staff turned up to work. But the corporation insists that carving off a large chunk of staff is essential because of steep cuts in government funding. NUJ general secretary Michelle Stanistreet joined a picket line at TV . Centre shortly after midnight and will address strikers outside Bush . House later today. She said journalists were angered at a 'change in approach' by the BBC . to slash roles, with a number of compulsory redundancies already made and . more expected in the coming weeks. The two sides will meet for talks on August 11, but the NUJ leader said: . 'There has been absolutely no meaningful movement from the BBC to . address the cases of individual journalists losing their jobs now.' An NUJ spokesman accused the . corporation of unnecessarily spending money on redundancies, rather than . moving staff to different roles. He said: 'All the journalists currently affected are . willing to accept redeployment and they face an uncertain future through . no fault of their own. 'The BBC is wasting thousands of pounds making skilled and experienced . people compulsorily redundant instead of redeploying staff. 'This is . money that should be used to make better programmes and to ensure the . future of quality journalism at the corporation.' Picket lines: Journalists have pitched their protests outside BBC offices around the country, including the Bush House centre in London . A BBC spokesman said: 'We are disappointed that the NUJ is intending to . strike and apologise to our audience for any disruption to services this . may cause. 'Industrial action will not alter the fact that the BBC is faced with a . number of potential compulsory redundancies, following significant cuts . to the central government grants that support the World Service and BBC . Monitoring. 'We will continue with our efforts to reduce the need for compulsory . redundancies. 'However, the number of posts that we are having to close . means that, unfortunately, it is likely to be impossible for us to avoid . some compulsory redundancies.' NUJ members working for the BBC's Arabic service were on the third day of a six-day strike in a separate dispute over rotas. Broadcasting bosses are said to be even more worried about the impact of . a work-to-rule action that will follow today's walkout. This will stop staff acting up or going beyond their allotted hours - practices upon which the BBC is said to rely.","Have I got News For You repeat shown in place of Newsnight .

Daisy Ogston is one of just 130 people around the world to suffer from Adams-Oliver Syndrome, a rare congenital disorder affecting the scalp and cranium. A 7cm by 6cm section of her skull is . missing, so the only things protecting Daisy’s brain are the . fluid around it and a thin layer of skin. Delicate: Daisy Ogston, pictured with her mother Kerry at home in Norwich, was born with half her skull missing and could die if she bursts into tears . Doctors have warned Daisy’s parents Kerry Ogston, 32, and Mark Jenner, 34, to try . and prevent her getting upset at all costs because crying causes increased . pressure on the brain and she has less protection to cope with it. And vigorous crying causes the vital cerebral fluid to drain into the open skull, exposing her brain to infection. The . last time Daisy burst into tears, as a baby in 2010, she was . so unwell she spent three months in Great Ormond Street Hospital in London receiving specialist treatment. Mrs Ogston, from Norwich, Norfolk, today said that despite her daughter’s incredibly . rare condition she is determined Daisy will enjoy a 'normal' life. She said: 'We have had to find ways to calm her down before she starts to cry. 'We . have to watch her all the time and when you have a baby as fragile as . Daisy it’s easy to never want to let her do anything, but that’s no way for . her to live. 'It’s difficult because it’s not safe for her to play with other . children, they could knock her or upset her by accident and it could be . disastrous. 'She . has a helmet which she wears to protect her head from bumps but she . can’t wear it for too long because it causes her to sweat and the skin . on the top of her head is still so fragile it will just flake off. 'It . means there is nowhere in the house that is safe for her to play . because everywhere has door handles or corners that could hurt her.' Scan: A photo and X-ray of Daisy's skull shortly after she was born at Norfolk University Hospital in 2010. Both show the 15cm by 15cm hole in her head . Daisy is one of just 130 people around the world to suffer from Adams-Oliver Syndrome, a rare congenital disorder affecting the scalp and cranium. She regularly wears a helmet to protect her head . Doctors, . baffled by the rare condition, believe her only hope of a . normal life is pioneering surgery, previously performed only a hand . full of times. But Daisy must wait until she is 13 before her skull will be strong enough for surgeons to operate on. It . means her parents face 11 years of keeping their daughter constantly happy so she never feels the need to cry, and safe . from falls and tumbles. Luckily, Daisy is a happy and lively child, who receives so much attention she rarely gets upset. Mrs Ogston said: 'The . surgery will be great when it happens but it’s a long wait and the . surgeon we are dealing with hasn’t actually carried out the procedure . before. 'He . will open up her skull and cut out a piece the same size and shape as the . hole, split it open like a sandwich, and use one half to put back . where it was and the second to fill the original hole. 'I just hope he has a chance to do it once before it’s Daisy’s turn.' Daisy . was born at Norfolk University Hospital in 2010 with a 15cm . by 15cm hole in her head, deformed hands and feet and a heart defect, . despite a 'totally normal pregnancy'. Adams-Oliver Syndrome . can often be spotted in the womb, but Daisy was not diagnosed until the . day after she was born. Doctors, baffled by the rare condition, believe Daisy's only hope of a normal life is pioneering surgery, previously performed only a hand full of times. Unfortunately, she will have to wait until she is 13 before the procedure can be carried out . Her . fragile skull has partially healed, with the hole halving in size, but . doctors did not expect it to grow any further and will leave a . permanent gap. As well . as crying, the tiniest knock or bump could give the toddler a massive . brain haemorrhage, killing her outright, or leaving her with severe . brain damage. She wears a protective helmet as often as possible, but the sweat . on her head risks eroding the skin covering the hole in her skull. Mrs Ogston, . who cares for Daisy full time and Mr Jenner, a floor . layer, plan to protect their daughter by building a special ‘soft room’ at their Norwich home. But . staggeringly, the family have been denied funding from their local . council’s disability facility grant, because the occupational therapist . sent to assess them believed the youngster was not disabled enough. Mrs Ogston is now desperately trying to raise £15,000 to provide the protective . environment which will allow her daughter to have as much independence . as possible growing up. She said: 'Like any . normal two-year-old she’s into everything, she can already take her . helmet off by herself if she decides she has had enough of it. 'To . have a soft-padded room would change our lives. It would give her . independence and would help her development and her health which would . keep her happy.'","Daisy Ogston is one of just 130 people around the world to suffer from Adams-Oliver Syndrome .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 06:05 EST, 25 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:40 EST, 25 July 2012 . Three-year-old Harvey Webb has a rare condition that means he is blinded by light - and has to wear special heavy-duty sunglasses to help him see. Parents Louise and Andy, have resorted to keeping their curtains closed at the family home in Tonbridge, Kent, to help their son see their faces. Harvey’s condition, known as Achromatopsia, means he is also completely colour blind - and can only see the world in black and white. Louise, 35, said her son may never see a sunrise or sunset because his eyes cannot handle the light. Harvey must wear special sunglasses to help him to see outside. At home the curtains are always closed . Andy, 34, a recruitment consultant, said: 'Normal daylight to him is like the glare you get when you are driving on a wet day and sunlight reflects off the rainwater on the road. 'We have to make everything as dark as possible for him to be able to see.' Achromatopsia is total colour blindness and is the rarest type of colour vision deficiency. Children with the condition are born with faulty cone photoreceptors in the eye. This means they see everything in shades of black, white and grey. They have general poor sight with blurry central vision and are very sensitive to light. However, the condition does not get any worse as they grow older. They can use their outer vision to read and get around. Louise, 35, added: 'When we first moved into our house we were worried the neighbours would just think we were really unfriendly, as we always had the curtains shut. 'But we have to keep them closed to keep out as much sunlight as possible.' Harvey puts on his prescription sunglasses when he gets up, and wears them until he goes to bed - they are designed to let only 10 per cent of light in. The condition means Harvey struggles to play outside on bright days and he has to take cover from the rays. The family have had to deal with comments from passers-by who think Harvey’s dark glasses are a fashion statement. Louise said: 'It’s frustrating because obviously he can hardly see without them, and in the beginning | did worry about what people would think - a lot of people just think we put them on him to look cool. 'Thankfully most people are positive though, and say things like ‘cool shades’.' Affecting just one in 35,000 people, the condition affects the retina meaning the cells responsible for colour and light sensitivity in the eye don’t function. Andy and Louise Webb play with their son with the curtains closed . Andy and Louise have just found out their daughter Megan, 3months, has the same condition as Harvey . Harvey was diagnosed with . Achromatopsia at Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, in December 2009 after . his parents noticed he was having trouble focusing. They . were initially assured this was down to a condition called Nystagmus, . but at seven months old they were told the devastating diagnosis. Andy said: 'We were shocked, and felt numb as we hadn’t heard of the condition before. 'As children so much is learnt through sight and observing things outdoors, such as wildlife in the trees or a plane in the sky. 'With Harvey we need to find other ways to show him so we use books and TV.' Harvey won't be able to drive when he grows up but will attend mainstream school . Harvey’s baby sister Megan, three months old, has also been diagnosed although she doesn’t need special glasses yet, and can wear normal ones in bright light. Louise said: 'We were distraught when we first found out and it felt like we were going through a kind of grieving process because we knew they wouldn’t be able to see the world how we see it. 'They’ll never know though as they were born with the condition and we certainly won’t let it stop them doing what they want to do.' Harvey now goes to Dorton House nursery run by the Royal London Society for the Blind, helping him to make the most of what little vision he has. His sight means he won’t ever be able to drive, and will need extra help in the classroom, although he will still attend a mainstream school. There is currently no treatment for the condition but both Harvey and Megan are taking part in research for a cure, partly funded by the charity Fight for Sight. Dr Tony Moore, consultant at Moorfields Eye Hosptial, London, said: 'Harvey’s activities will be restricted by his eyesight, and he will be less confident outdoors because of his extreme light sensitivity. 'His vision is much worse in bright sunlight.' Louise said: 'It’s quite difficult for Andy as he would love to teach Harvey to play football but his sight makes co-ordination a bit difficult. 'That doesn’t mean he won’t try though, and we won’t let him dwell on what he will find difficult.'

"By . Vanessa Allen and Nick Craven . UPDATED: . 09:04 EST, 17 February 2012 . 'Tipping point': Pig farmer Stephen Brown was under investigation after serious allegations of animal cruelty were made about his farm . A farmer targeted by animal rights activists has been found dead days after evidence of horrific cruelty on his farm was revealed. Stephen Brown, 52, is believed to have shot himself in a  field after saying he was ‘absolutely gutted’ about the shocking exposé. An undercover animal rights activist secretly filmed a worker on his Norfolk farm beating a pig to death with an iron bar, kicking piglets and smashing a live animal’s head on to a concrete floor. Still photographs showed a worker aiming a powerful rifle at a sow and the apparently lifeless body in its pen. The RSPCA described it as one of the worst cases of animal abuse it had seen and launched its own investigation after the secret footage was released by campaign group Animal Equality last weekend, and welfare and standards group Red Tractor suspended the farm from its quality assurance scheme. There was no suggestion that Mr Brown was directly involved in the cruelty, but the film included footage of apparent long-term neglect and showed animals with large open sores and festering wounds. Mr Brown gave an emotional interview to the BBC on Monday in which he said he was hit ‘very hard’ by the film, but claimed it had been ‘dramatised’. He and his wife Fiona had been due to take their two daughters on a half-term ski trip but cancelled it after the video was released. A worker at the farm in Norfolk aims a powerful rifle at a sow in its pen. The footage outraged animal rights activists as it also showed apparent long-term neglect of animals with large open sores and festering wounds . Shocking: An undercover investigation exposed horrific acts of cruelty to animals on Stephen Brown's farm in Thetford, Norfolk, which supplies meat to leading supermarkets . Police were called to Harling Farm, near Thetford, on Wednesday  morning and found his body.  Officers said there were no suspicious circumstances. Mr Brown kept 4,000 pigs on the 500-acre farm, which has been in his family since 1920. He took it over from his father Michael, 82, a former parish council chairman who still lives with the family on the farm. Hairdresser Lorraine Mitchell, 40, who once worked as a pig handler on the farm, said: ‘He was a hard-working farmer who cared a lot for his animals. Grim discovery: This dreadful image of the place where the farm buried the pigs on site was part of evidence forming a case of animal cruelty against farmer Stephen Brown . ‘I never saw him do anything bad to the pigs or raise a hand to them. ‘He and his father were great bosses. Whatever actually happened, it was not his fault.’ Mrs Mitchell said she was shocked by his appearance during a TV news interview about the footage, and said he looked like ‘a broken man’. Friend and fellow farmer William Nunn, the leader of Breckland District Council, said he had known Mr Brown for more than 25 years. ‘He was really shocked by the pig thing,’ he said. ‘I think because he was a soft-hearted, caring farmer it caught him off-guard.’ Horrific: Workers were caught on video beating pigs with iron bars, battering piglets, scraping knives across their backs and smashing animals onto concrete floors. A neighbouring pig farmer, who asked not to be named, said the undercover activist had tried for jobs at other farms in the area. He said: ‘It seems very unfair  to blame Mr Brown for something that he personally had nothing to do with. ‘You can’t be responsible for all your employees throughout every minute of the day. I don’t know Stephen’s employees but I did know him, and he would never, ever treat an animal cruelly. ‘But now he and his wife and his two young daughters have paid the price for someone else’s actions.’ A spokesman for Animal Equality refused to comment. The group supports ‘non-violent direct action’.","Married father-of-two Stephen Brown, 52, is believed to have shot himself .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 08:30 EST, 28 June 2011 . No joke: Naguib Sawiris apologised for the cartoons of Mickey and Minnie Mouse which angered Muslims . A cartoon of Mickey Mouse with a beard and Minnie Mouse wearing the niqab face veil has angered hard-line Muslims. The pictures were posted online by an Egyptian Christian businessman to advertise his mobile phone firm. The ultra-conservative Muslims, known as Salafis, called the cartoon posted by media mogul and politician Naguib Sawiris 'a mockery of Islam'. The Salafis have since launched campaigns on Facebook and Twitter calling on Muslims to boycott Mr Sawiris's mobile phone company Mobinil. The cartoons are another source of . sectarian tensions in Egypt, which have already seen widespread violence . during a period of political transition. Shares in Mobinil and Orascom Telecom, both companies owned by Mr Sawiris, fell on the Egyptian stock exchange. Sawiris is founder of the liberal Free Egyptians Party which believes in a secular Egypt. He . owns several media companies and after Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak . was ousted in February, his party called for . the separation of state and religion. After the cartoon was posted online, it immediately caused a flurry of complaints on Twitter. Mr Sawiris then tweeted: 'I apologise for those who don't take this as a joke; I just . thought it was a funny picture; no disrespect meant. I am sorry.' Several Facebook groups calling for a boycott of his mobile phone company have appeared and now have around 60,000 followers. The . group, called 'We are joking Sawiris', said: 'If you are really a . Muslim, and you love your religion, boycott his projects. We have to cut . out the tongue of any person who attacks our religion.' At . least 15 Salafi lawyers have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Sawiris of . religious contempt, an official at the prosecutor's office said. Another Facebook group named 'We hate you Mickey Sawiris' depicted the Egyptian businessman as Mickey Mouse. The group's motto is: 'No to mockery of Islam.' A Salafi cleric Mazen el-Sersawi appeared on television to criticise Mr Sawiris. Mockery: Mickey Mouse was depicted with a beard and Minnie Mouse had a face veil in the Egyptian mobile phone advert . He said: 'How can a man like this make fun of Muslims, in a country on the brink of sectarian discord? 'If this is just joking, why don't you depict Mickey Mouse as a monk or a nun?' It is not the first time Mr Sawiris has provoked criticism with comments about Islam. In 2007, he spoke out against the Islamic veil. He told a newspaper: 'I am not against veil... but when I walk in the street, I feel like a foreigner.' Mr Sawiris posted his drawings around the time that a . Danish court sentenced a Somali man to ten years in prison for breaking . into the home of a Danish cartoonist who caricatured the Prophet . Muhammad, armed with an axe. Muhideen Mohammed Geelle, 30, was found guilty of a terror attempt. Geelle entered cartoonist Kurt Westergaard's home in Aarhus on New Year's Day 2010. Mr Westergaard locked himself inside a panic room and was unharmed. Police arrived and apprehended Geelle after shooting him in the leg. Danish authorities said they have . foiled several terror plots linked to the 2005 newspaper cartoons of the . Prophet Muhammad that triggered protests in Muslim countries. Salafism is an extremely conservative branch of Islam. Saudi Arabia's puritanical Wahhabi interpretation is considered its forerunner, and Saudi preachers on TV and the Internet have been key to the spread of Salifism in Egypt. Salafists are distinguished by the way they dress. In many parts of Cairo, women wear the niqab -  a veil which reveals only the eyes. Male followers often have long beards and shave off their moustaches, a style said to imitate the Prophet Muhammad. Political commentators are worried that the controversial cartoons could spark further violence on Egyptian streets ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in September.","15 lawsuits filed for religious contempt .

Guilty: Footballer Lee Hughes was fined £500 for putting his hand between a young woman's legs and lifting her into the air . Footballer Lee Hughes was fined £500 today for putting his hand between a young woman’s legs during a hotel Christmas party and lifting her into the air. Notts County striker Hughes, 36, who did not know the woman and had not even spoken to her, pleaded guilty at Croydon Crown Court to common assault. In addition to the fine he was bound over to keep the peace for one year and ordered to pay £120 costs. Hughes had originally been charged with sexual assault, but after the Crown Prosecution Service consulted the victim his not guilty plea was accepted and the lesser charge preferred. 'This dates back to the third of December last year,' said prosecutor Mr Julius Capon. 'The defendant is a professional footballer and was staying with others in his team at the Aerodrome Hotel. 'There was a fire alarm and everyone had to leave the hotel and assembled in the car park outside. 'The complainant had attended a works function at the hotel, a Christmas party, and was speaking to her friends when the defendant, who had not spoken to her and who she did not know, put his hand between her legs, under her dress and lifted her up into the air. 'The complainant was annoyed and upset and afterwards Mr Hughes tried to hug her and suggested he was having a laugh. 'This was inappropriate and disgraceful conduct,' added Mr. Capon. Hard man: Hughes tussles with a rival player while in action for his team Notts County in a match against Wigan Athletic . The court was not told of Hughes’ previous conviction of causing the death of father-of-four Douglas Graham by dangerous driving in Meriden, Coventry, for which he received six years imprisonment in August 2004 and was released after serving half the sentence. He had played for West Brom, Coventry City and Kidderminster Harriers before that drink-drive tragedy and since his release has played for Oldham Athletic and Notts County. Hughes’ lawyer told the court the hotel incident was no more sinister than 'horseplay.' 'This was utterly inappropriate,' the Recorder of Croydon Warwick McKinnon told Hughes, binding him over to keep the peace for twelve months in the sum of £500. Hughes’ defence team had asked for the case to be listed at 2pm, but arrived two hours early and the case was called on almost immediately.","Notts County striker did not know the woman and had not even spoken to her .

Arrest: Gordon Collins-Faunce told police he picked up his baby son by . his head and threw him in a chair when he became overwhelmed caring for . him . A two-month-old boy has died from brain injuries after his father allegedly lifted him by the head in a fit of rage and threw him into a chair, causing his neck to snap backwards. The tragedy comes after health services had already been warned about injuries to Gordon Collins-Faunce's three-year-old daughter after she had come to school covered in bruises. Collins-Faunce, 23, told police he 'was losing control' as he cared for baby Ethan, his twin brother Lucas and his older half sister at their home in Arundel, Maine. After his fiancée, 23-year-old Christina Henderson, left for work at 9.30 a.m., he went outside for a cigarette and returned to find Ethan and his sister crying, the Portland Press Herald reported. He admitted he was overwhelmed and pick the baby up from the floor by his head, holding him so the baby's feet dangled as high as his chest. 'He said he stood up straight and held [Ethan] by the head with both hands for ""one minute max"",' the police affidavit said. He then hurled Ethan into a chair in the living room, seeing the boy's head snap back as he landed. 'On a scale of 1-10, he estimated . his force to be 8 or 9,' the affidavit read. Collins-Faunce originally told police he had found the baby struggling to breathe and gurgling at the mouth as he laid in his crib. He said the boy's eyes were barely open and he had 'lockjaw'. The father said he handed the boy to his stepmother and called 911. An ambulance took Ethan to Southern . Maine Medical Center, then transferred to the Special Care . Unit at Maine Medical Center. Victim: Baby Ethan sustained severe brain damage and died three days later. His father also admitted he had previously broken his arm when he became stressed while changing his diaper . Doctors found Ethan had severe bleeding around the brain and had no activity on the left side. He was taken off life support and died shortly after midnight on Tuesday, three days after the attack. Police arrested Collins-Faunce after the alleged incident and charged him with assault. Now the state Attorney General's Office will decide what new charges could be brought in light of the death. Charges could include manslaughter or depraved indifference murder, which is . conduct 'so heinous that it shows a total disregard for the value . of human life,' Deputy Attorney General William Stokes told the Press Herald. Ethan had allegedly suffered at the hands of his father before, yet it is not clear if child protective services were made aware of these, or if they provided a response. Family: Collins-Faunce is pictured with his fiancee Christina Henderson, her three-year-old daughter and their twin sons Ethan and Lucas. A family friend said she believed the father picked on Ethan . Collins-Faunce told police he had broken Ethan's arm when he was four-weeks old after twisting it on purpose when he became frustrated while changing his diaper. At first he had said the injury was an accident after the boy's arm had become stuck between the crib and its protective bumper as he lifted him. Doctors also said Ethan, whom they described as a 'dirty child' with nappy rash and an unwashed belly button, had older brain injuries. In addition, the state Department of Health and Human . Services were contacted by Ethan's sister's daycare, claiming the three-year-old girl had arrived covered with bruises. The affidavit does not indicate whether the DHHS investigated. A DHHS spokesperson said he could not comment on individual cases due to confidentiality laws, but they had a 'rigorous process'. Friends told the Press Herald that Collins-Faunce had been targetting Ethan, and that his girlfriend had never known. 'He's been targeting Ethan and she just didn't realize it,' Nicole Tucker said. Anger issues: Collins-Faunce was discharged from the military after he held a knife to a roommate's throat . The affidavit also noted that Collins-Faunce has been taking medication . for post-traumatic stress disorder as he was . physically and sexually abused as a boy by various foster parents. He told police he was discharged from the military after he held a knife to a roommate's . throat and had been an alcohol throughout 2010 but had since stopped drinking. His medication for post-traumatic stress disorder had recently changed, and he was having trouble sleeping. But Tucker said his new mood stabilisers seemed to be worked. 'The day this happened, he didn't take his meds,' she said. Collins-Faunce is being held in the York County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail. The other two children were removed from the home but Henderson is now petitioning to have them returned now her fiance is out of the house.","Gordon Collins-Faunce, 23, admitted he was 'losing control' of his children .

She was mauled and almost killed by a friend's chimpanzee three years ago . A woman who had a face transplant after she was badly disfigured and blinded by a rampaging chimpanzee said that she would like to be able to see her own reflection. Charla Nash, a 58-year-old single mother from Stamford, Connecticut, almost died after the mauling three years ago. Her friend's pet, a 14-year-old male ape, tore off her hands, nose, lips and eyelids and left her blind. Speaking at a rehabilitation center outside Boston, she said she focuses on one day at a time and is glad to have survived. Ms Nash told WABC this week: 'I wouldn't mind seeing what I look like.' In . an emotional and candid interview, she revealed that she had been attacked by Travis the chimp before the near-fatal attack took place. Ms Nash had avoided the . 200-pound creature after it ripped hair from the back of her head. The single mother also revealed that she thought the relationship that her friend Sandra Herrold had with the primate was incredibly strange. Ms Herrold died in 2010. Ms Nash said Travis ate well and was allowed to drink wine by Ms Herrold, who treated the chimp like a 'companion'. The primate also allegedly slept in the bed with its owner which Ms Nash said was 'bizarre'. She had been helping Ms Herrold lure her pet . chimp Travis inside when the 200-pound animal ripped off her face. On a harrowing 911 call, Ms Herrold can be heard screaming that the chimp was 'eating her'.  The animal was later shot and killed by police. At . the time, Ms Herrold speculated the pet was trying to protect her and . didn't recognise Ms Nash because she had changed her hairstyle. Scroll down for video . Slow recovery: Ms Nash, 58, is undergoing intensive rehabilitation at a specialist facility outside Boston and hopes to have a hand transplant in the next few years . Survivor: Charla Nash, a single mother, is accompanied by reporter Sarah Wallace. She was blinded and lost her hands after the chimp attacked her in Stamford, Connecticut . Six months ago, Ms Nash underwent a 20-hour operation which left her with a new face, prosthetic eyes and new hands. A team of more than 30 surgeons, . nurses and anaesthetists at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, led . by Dr Bohdan Pomanhac, painstakingly rebuilt her face. They took a donor's skin, underlying muscle, nerves and upper palate and transplanted the whole face on to Ms Nash's skull. Although a serious infection meant the . hands had to be removed, she can now smell again, eat solid food – and . says her new face ’has really given me a life back'. Ms Nash had previously told the Today show: 'Of the family who donated the face of . their loved one, she said: ‘Words can’t even say enough. It’s really . given me a life back. It’s such a wonderful thing. I cannot thank them . enough.' Horrific injuries: Charla Nash hid her face under a veil after the attack, in which the chimp ripped off her nose, eyelids and lips . Near death: Ms Nash before the attack three years ago. She was nearly killed when her friend's 200lb chimpanzee turned on her . Ms . Nash’s 20-year-old daughter Brianna, a college student, added: ‘I’m still waiting for some of the . underlying bone structure to take some shape on her cheeks – but it’s my . mom.’ Ms Nash had previously described her disappointment . on finding out that her hands had been removed after contracting . pneumonia, which affected her circulation. 'I . was disappointed that I had them and they're gone again,' she said. 'But I'm hoping for in the future, that it can be done again.' Healing will continue over the next year, and Ms Nash hopes she will be given new hands so she can get a seeing eye dog. She had hidden her face under a veil . for two years, but bravely revealed the disfigured features in an . interview with Oprah Winfrey just a few months after the attack. At . the time she said: 'I wear (the veil) so I don't scare people. Sometimes other people might insult you, so I figure maybe it's easier . if I just walk around covered up.' Precision: They placed the donor's face on Ms Nash and connected each nerve, muscle and blood vessel . Ms . Herold died of an aneurysm last year. Ms Nash's family are suing her . estate for $50million and the state for $150million, saying . officials failed to prevent the attack. In 2003, Travis had to be captured by police after he got loose and was spotted running through the streets of downtown Stamford, Connecticut. The compensation would help the 58-year-old to pay for her extensive medical and rehabilitation bills and also cover the cost of her long-term care. Ms Nash and her family will find out in the next few weeks whether her lawsuit will be allowed to proceed through the courts. The double transplant was the first of . its kind in the U.S., and has only been performed once before in the . world, in France. It was paid for by the Department of Defense, through a . contract it gave Brigham and Women's Hospital in 2009 to cover the cost . of face transplants for veterans and some civilians, hospital officials . said.","Ms Nash had her hair ripped out by 200lb chimp BEFORE she was mauled .

On trial: Robert Major, 63, is on trial at Aylesbury Crown Court charged with child sex offences involving a father and his son . A scout master who molested a teenager 30 years ago on several occasions at a swimming pool went on to abuse the man’s son, a jury heard today. Robert Major's copycat crimes were only exposed when the latest victim told his father he had been abused by the now 63-year-old. The horrified father then revealed his own secret which he had kept bottled-up for three decades. Aylesbury Crown court heard that Major had been a supervisor at a leisure centre swimming pool in the 1970s when he took advantage of the then schoolboy. He had offered the 11-year-old free swimming sessions before manipulating him into participating in sexual acts in return, it was claimed. In a bizarre twist, the police discovered the historic sexual abuse case on the victim, now 45, when his son came forward alleging sexual assaults by the same man in the late 1990s. Police interviewed the father and were shocked to find he had also suffered at the hands of Major 30 years previously, said prosecutor Mary Loram. She told the court the son, now 27, took 11 years to pluck up the courage to tell his parents and police of his shocking ordeal. She said Major offered him cigarettes and alcohol and let him watch porn at his flat in exchange for sexual favours. This, said Ms Loram, was a mirror image of what his father - who had suppressed the abuse for four decades - had been put through at the hands of Major. He let the father swim at the Tiddenfoot Leisure Centre, in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, free of charge in return for sexual encounters in the shower room, bar area and changing rooms, it was claimed. The jury heard that Major had been a Scout leader in Leighton Buzzard from the 1960s to the 1980s as well as holding a role as supervisor at the local swimming baths. Ms Loram said: 'The son told his parents in 2009 that the defendant had done things to him sexually. 'Despite support from his parents he didn’t want to go to police at the time but his dad did want to do something about it and contacted police. 'It wasn’t until 2010 that he gave an account to police. Officers went to speak to his parents and his dad was interviewed. 'He (the father) went on to tell police how he knew Robert Major and how he went to the leisure centre as a teenager every day. 'The defendant worked at the pool and would let him into the pool free of charge. He told police how he went to the defendant’s flat and watched a soft porn film with him. 'Once he started looking back at what had happened all that time ago it all came out.' Major is alleged to have let the father swim at the Tiddenfoot Leisure Centre, in Leighton Buzzard, free of charge in return for sexual encounters, it was claimed . The prosecutor added the pair performed sex acts on each other in the bar area of the leisure centre when it was empty, the showers, changing room and in the 'plant room' - an underground room which controlled the pool's temperature. She added the acts also happened one time in the back of the defendant's Ford Cortina when it was parked outside the leisure centre. The father told police he hadn’t thought about these things for 30 years, the court heard. 'Just like his son, he was made to feel this was normal and got cigarettes out of it. What teenager would say no to cigarettes, alcohol and porn?,' Ms Loram said. Thirty years later, in a freak coincidence, Major continued his abusing ways with his former victim’s son,' the court heard. This time it was at an address in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire in the late 1990s into the early 2000s when the boy was between 12 and 16 years. Major denies eight counts of indecent . assault, two counts of indecency with a child and one count of rape . against the father between 1977 and 1981, as well as two counts of . indecent assault, two counts of indecency with a child and one count of . buggery against the son between 1998 and 2001.

A mother, whose son said Sandusky raped him in the basement of the coach's home, testified today that the boy's laundry was often short of underwear. She was the last to speak for the prosecution as defense lawyers for the former Penn State coach brought their first witnesses in his sexual abuse trial. The . woman said her son told her that Sandusky called him late one night . after the first round of charges were filed in November, asking if he . would be a character witness. One month later, prosecutors brought charges against Sandusky, alleging he had forced anal sex with the boy at his home in Pennsylvania. Defense begins: Jerry Sandusky arrives at the courthouse today to start the second week of the sexual abuse trial in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania . The . woman said her son's laundry, which she did two or three times a week, would often be short of underwear and he . would claim he had thrown it away because he had an accident. She said: 'I always wondered why he . never had any underwear in the laundry. There was never any underwear, . any socks... that was odd to me.' On cross-examination she told Sandusky's attorney Joseph Amendola: 'He would tell me he had an accident and threw them out. 'All the time, his stomach always hurt. [He] couldn't use the bathroom right.' Last week . the teenager, now 18, said Sandusky forced him to have anal sex that made him bleed. The woman wept as she told the court that she felt responsible because she had encouraged her son to go to the coach's house while she was working two jobs to support the family, according to philly.com . The boy first met Sandusky at the age of 12 through the Second Mile charity, which the coach founded to provide help for troubled youngsters. Over the next four years, the witness said her son began to have health problems and get into trouble at school. The mother said the boy became emotionally closed off and didn't want to spend weekends at the coach's house. Few friends: The first two defence witnesses, former assistant Penn State football coaches Booker Brooks (left) and Dick Anderson leave the Centre County Courthouse after testifying . Prosecutors withdrew one count against Sandusky today saying the statute he was charged under did not apply at the time of the alleged illegal contact. That leaves 51 counts involving ten alleged victims over a 15-year span. Sandusky, whose November arrest led to the firing of Hall of Fame football coach Joe Paterno, has denied wrongdoing. A former Penn State assistant coach . who worked with Sandusky testified today that he and other members . of the football staff were present when Sandusky brought young boys . into the team's showers. Dick . Anderson, the first witness called by the defense after prosecutors . rested their case, said he never witnessed anything inappropriate. 'If . Jerry would bring someone in with The Second Mile, they had been . working out, for whatever reason they came in, it was not uncommon ... with the other coaches in the shower as well,' Anderson said. Anderson also testified that it was not unusual for him to be in the showers with younger boys at the YMCA. During his testimony, Anderson said Sandusky had a 'wonderful reputation' in the community. 'He was well thought of in every regard,' Anderson said. He also testified about the busy schedule Penn State coaches kept. Preparations: Defense attorney Joe Amendola stacks boxes to take into the Centre County Courthouse . In their questions to prosecution witnesses, the defense has sought to show how the stories of accusers have changed over time. The defense says witnesses were prodded and coached by investigators and prosecutors, that some are motivated to lie by the hopes of a civil lawsuit jackpot, and to paint Sandusky's interactions with children as misunderstood and part of a lifelong effort to help, not victimize, them. Defense attorney Joe Amendola pressed the accusers for dates and locations, details of their involvement with the kids' charity Sandusky founded, arrests or drug problems, contacts they had with Sandusky in the years since the alleged abuse ended and the terms of representation deals with civil lawyers. At least six said they told incorrect or incomplete stories in early contacts with police, and three testified that some of the details only came back to them in recent years.","Woman wept on the stand as she told court she encouraged her son to go to Penn State coordinator's house from the age of 12 .

Lesley Dunford was onvicted of the manslaughter of her three-year-old daughter after an inquest into the 2004 death was dramatically halted by a coroner . A 'remorseless' mother jailed for killing her three-year-old daughter had laughed and joked as the young girl lay dying in hospital, it emerged today. Lesley Dunford, 33, was yesterday convicted of the manslaughter of her young daughter Lucy in 2004, eight years after a coroner dramatically halted the youngster's inquest. Dunford, jailed for seven years yesterday, suffocated Lucy just six months after her seven-month-old son Harvey died in an apparent cot death, a court heard. But it emerged today that Dunford laughed and joked with her youngest daughter just minutes after medics said they were losing the battle save Lucy. The mother also telephoned a vicar and her husband before calling for an ambulance for her stricken daughter, according to The Sun. Dunford's daughter Lucy was found with cuts and bruises on her neck and shoulders at the family home in Camber, East Sussex, in February 2004. The three-year-old was rushed to Conquest Hospital in Hastings but could not be saved. After conflicting post mortem reports, Dunford was arrested two days after Lucy's death, but a lack of evidence saw prosecutors drop the case. She was rearrested when a coroner dramatically halted the youngster's inquest and forced police to reopen the investigation. A judge told Dunford she had gone from 'carer to killer' when she inflicted fatal injuries on her young daughter in 2004. A jury at Lewes Crown Court convicted Dunford of manslaughter but cleared her of murder. Sentencing yesterday Judge Richard . Brown said: 'The jury have convicted you of manslaughter of your . three-year-old daughter Lucy. 'It . may well be you are the only one who knows exactly what happened on . that dreadful day in 04 which took you from carer to killer. 'Since then you have done your level best to lie your way out of any responsibility. 'This indicates you have little or no remorse for what you did.' An . original post mortem found that Lucy may have died from a sudden onset . of a bacterial infection which led to her choking on her own vomit. Dunford's house in Camber, East Sussex, where her daughter Lucy was found not breathing with bruises . However, . during a second examination this was disputed and the idea put forward . that suspicious bruising on the tot's upper body may mean her airways . had been compressed forcefully. At the time Dunford claimed her . daughter had been 'perfectly fine' earlier in the day but that she had . been tired so she had put her to bed - she later told paramedics she . thought her daughter had had a 'fit'. After . she had found her daughter Dunfold refused to ring the emergency . services until she had spoken to her husband - whom she told 'it's . happened again' in reference to Lucy's younger brother Harley who had . been found dead in his cot six months previously. Describing how Dunford later joked about her daughter in hospital, nurse Caroline Simpson, who was in a waiting room with the mother, said: 'The girl put a paper cup of water to her mouth but it spilled down her front. 'The mum said, ""She's always doing that"". She appeared to find it quite hilarious.' Paramedics at Conquest Hospital in . Hastings noticed two marks on her neck which had started to bruise and . requested the attendance of police at the hospital. Dunford was arrested in February 2004 and interviewed by police then and again in May. Her case was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service who decided there was not enough evidence to charge Dunford with the murder of Lucy. 'This was a difficult and complex case that involved evidence from a number of medical experts.' Simon Ringrose, CPS . But during her inquest in 2009 East Sussex coroner Alan Craze demanded the case was revisited. The . inquest threw up new information which had been given by medical . experts in 2005 during a Family Court hearing into Lucy's death. This information had not been passed on to the CPS. Dunford was then rearrested and charged in July 2011. Prosecutor Sally Howes QC said during the trial that the inquest had 'excluded the likelihood' of a serious infection and found that injuries to the airways were consistent with an 'application of force'. On July 12, 2011, Dunford was therefore rearrested and Ms Howes said she told officers: 'I have been waiting for this to happen.' Dunford, 33, was arrested in February 2004 and interview by police then and again in May . During his sentencing Judge Brown told the court he took into account Dunford's 'childlike manner' and the 'long delay' in bringing the trial to court. However he said courts have a duty to 'protect little people like Lucy from violence'. Speaking afterwards, Detective Chief Inspector Nick Sloan, of the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: 'There was a thorough police investigation at the time but the forensic evidence then did not support a prosecution. 'The death of Lucy was immediately treated as suspicious by Sussex Police. Her mother was arrested and interviewed and there was a thorough investigation. 'However, based on the information available at the time, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decision was that there was insufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution. 'The CPS decision turned largely on reports from two pathologists, which were conflicting.' Simon Ringrose, of the CPS, said: 'This was a difficult and complex case that involved evidence from a number of medical experts. 'The reinvestigation into the circumstances of Lucy Dunford's death included obtaining further medical evidence. 'This evidence effectively ruled out a natural cause of death and was consistent with Lucy having been suffocated. 'The only person who could have done this was her mother, Lesley Dunford.' After the sentencing Wayne Dunford declined to comment.","CPS had felt there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute Lesley Dunford .

In a shocking turn of events Jeneba Tarmoh has conceded her spot in the 100 meters rather than race against training partner Allyson Felix. The two tied for third at the Track and Field Olympic Trials in Portland nine days ago. The top three finishers earn a spot on the team. Tarmoh notified USA Track and Field on Monday of her intention to withdraw. Too close to call: Jeneba Tarmoh (bottom) and Allyson Felix both cross the finish line for the Olympic trials with a time of 11.068. The race is decided by when their torsos cross the line, and the picture showed a tie . Her agent, Kimberly Holland, already . made it known that Tarmoh would not participate in a runoff Monday night . to break a third-place tie at the U.S. track trials. In an email sent through her agent to . USATF, Tarmoh said: 'I understand that with this decision I am no longer . running the 100m dash in the Olympic Games and will be an alternate for . the event.' USATF President Stephanie Hightower said the organization is 'disappointed' Tarmoh had a change of heart. Felix will now race in both the 100 and 200 in London. Tarmoh didn't qualify in the 200, but is eligible to run in the Olympic 400-meter relay. 'The situation has been difficult for everyone involved,' Felix said in a statement. 'I had accepted the USATF decision and was prepared to run at 5 p.m. I wanted to earn my spot on this team and not have it conceded to me so I share in everyone's disappointment that this runoff will not happen. All I can do now is turn my focus to London.' Felix sailed to victory in the 200m on Saturday night. Tarmoh, just left of Felix, did not finish in the top three in that . Tarmoh only reluctantly agreed to the runoff. She believed she won on the track fair and square nine days ago. 'In my heart of hearts, I just feel like I earned the third spot,' she said Sunday. 'I almost feel like I was kind of robbed.' Tarmoh leaned across the finish line . and looked up to see her name on the scoreboard in the third spot behind . winner Carmelita Jeter and runner-up Tianna Madison. The 22-year-old Tarmoh even took a . celebratory lap around the track, waving an American flag. She received a . medal and held a news conference. Then, she found out about the dead heat from reporters. The thrilling Olympic athletic heat . which ended in a tie had the world talking as it was unprecedented. The two female sprinters involved in . the dead heat were offered the chance to decide their fate with the toss . of a coin, but opted to rely on their athletic ability instead. Battle: The track timer had initially named Tarmoh, right, as the winner before officials reviewed the results . 'I was pushed into a corner. They . said if you don't make a decision, you give your spot up. I work too . hard to just give my spot up. I had to say it was a runoff.' The controversy in the 100 . overshadowed the entire trials simply because USA Track and Field had no . protocol in place to deal with a dead heat. USATF officials quickly . scrambled to adopt a tiebreaking procedure. The athletes had a choice between a . runoff or a coin flip. They chose to settle matters on the track, not . with the flip of a quarter. 'They both feel they deserve a spot . on the team and they're willing to do it in a competitive manner and a . competitive fashion,' USATF President Stephanie Hightower said on Sunday. 'I think . it's good for the sport and it's good for them to show their level of . competitiveness and passion and drive for what they've been working so . hard to accomplish. 'The bottom line is that this is, in my opinion, the best way to be able to resolve this issue.' Disbelief: The two women finished dead heat for the third position on the women's 100m Olympic team . The resolution was delayed for eight . days because their coach, Bobby Kersee, wanted to wait to make a . decision until after 200m on Saturday. Felix won turned in a personal-best . time of 21.69 seconds, the fourth-fastest by an American. Tarmoh finished fifth. 'I didn't get to really enjoy it,' Felix said.

Abuse: Grandfather Kevin Howes, 55, arrives at court after leading a campaign of hate against neighbours . A grandfather who led a gang that terrorised a couple for over a year after falsely accusing them of being paedophiles has been jailed for 18 months. Kevin Howes, 55, and the group of 'cowardly' thugs hurled rocks at the terrified family's windows, smeared faeces across their door and pushed maggots through their letterbox. The gang also poured glue in their door lock and sprayed foam and paint across the front of their home in Norwich, a court heard yesterday. Howes, who lived in the same street, whipped up the vicious hate campaign against them. The 'neighbour from hell' grandfather admitted conspiracy to commit criminal damage after police linked calls and texts from his mobile to the yob attackers. The devastated couple - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - were finally forced out as they feared for their mental and physical health. Spencer Bowgen, who has a long history of offending,  admitted two charges of criminal damage for his part in the savage abuse. Bowgen, 26, of Norwich, threw a rock through the couple's window and poured white paint on their door last September. The lout also admitted stealing an iPad from a Virgin Money lounge. Bowgen was jailed for 17 months while Howes was sentenced to 18 months. In a statement read to the court the woman said the onslaught had made her life a misery. She said: 'A long time ago we used to be friends with Howes. We have no idea why he turned on us and caused us four years of hell.' The traumatised woman had to go to the doctors to be treated for intense stress from the relentless attacks. Robert Warner, prosecuting, told the court the couple in Norwich had suffered a 'sustained campaign of attacks'. They would frequently return from their caravan on the Norfolk coast to find their home had been vandalised. The officers caught Bowgen on camera at 11.30pm on September 4 throwing a rock through the front window. Sentence: Howes was jailed for 18 months at Norwich Crown Court, pictured, after admitting conspiracy to commit criminal damage . Five minutes later he sent a text to Howes asking him to ring him. Two days later Bowgen was captured at 10.30pm hurling white paint from a jar at the home. The harassment also included threatening texts warning, 'you are both getting it you dirty child abusers'. The court heard there was no evidence whatsoever to back up the paedophile accusation. Mr Warner said Howes directed the louts who admitted criminal damage. Michael Clare, defending, said Bowgen had had a drinking problem. Mr Clare said Howes was in court 'to face the music'. He said: 'As a grandfather he ought to know better.  He knows he only has himself to blame. 'As far as he is concerned this business is finished.' Judge Peter Jacobs branded the men's behaviour 'cowardly'. 'The effect on the couple has been devastating,' he added. Judge Jacobs told Howes: 'You made their lives hell. There was not a day when they could come home with any peace of mind at all. 'They were always aware that people were watching them, waiting for them to go out.' Other members of the gang were jailed in April and May for a total of two-and-a-half years after admitting criminal damage. Shaun Claxton, 50, was jailed for nine months, Neil Smith, 44, for nine months and David Cullingford, 53, all of Norwich, for a year.","Kevin Howes, 55, led gang of thugs in four-year hate campaign against couple .

George Zimmerman stayed at the home of a close friend who is a former police officer for six weeks during the height of the public outcry over the Trayvon Martin shooting. The Miami Herald revealed while the world was looking for Zimmerman in the wake of the shooting in Sanford, Florida, he was hiding out in his friend Mark Osterman’s house in the neighboring town of Lake Mary. This news comes the same day as Zimmerman requested to have the judge in his case be replaced because he does not think he will get a fair trial because circuit judge Kenneth Lester Jr.  thinks Zimmerman ‘flaunted the system’ by failing to disclose his true financial holdings. Though Mr Osterman’s name was blurred out of court documents that were released publicly Thursday, The Herald used the personal stories mentioned during his police interview about the Martin shooting to determine his identity. Close friends: Mark Osterman (left) spoke to police and said that his friend George Zimmerman (right) stayed at his home in Lake Mary for six weeks during the height of the public outcry about the Trayvon Martin case . Together: Mr Osterman is seen leaving the Seminole County Jail with George Zimmerman on July 6 . Mr Osterman said that he has known Zimmerman since 2006, when his wife Sondra worked with Zimmerman. The couple became close friends with Zimmerman and his wife Shellie, so much so that Mrs Osterman presided over the Zimmerman’s wedding. During the interview, Mr Osterman, 44, described a seemingly close relationship with Zimmerman, saying that the two men would frequently go over to one another’s houses, take hunting trips, and go on monthly visits to the nearby Gander Mountain shooting range. Mr Osterman also claimed that he was the one to teach Zimmerman how to shoot. Though Mr Osterman, an Army veteran, met some of Zimmerman’s friends by hosting a graduation party for Zimmerman after he finished Seminole State College, he told FBI and Florida Department of Law Enforcement officials that he believes himself to be his one close friend. ‘Zimmerman stays in casual contact with a lot of people, but is not known to have any other close friends,’ Mr Osterman told investigators. Identified: Though their names were blurred out of the report, The Miami Herald identified Sondra Osterman (right) as the woman who presided over Zimmerman's wedding, and then deduced that Mark (left) was her husband . They seem to be extremely close, as Mr Osterman went to the scene of the Trayvon Martin shooting on the night of February 26 when the shooting happened, has accompanied Zimmerman to all of his interrogations, and was with Zimmerman when he did a video-taped walk-through of the crime scene for police. He apparently did so even though he is not Mr Zimmerman’s legal representation and has close ties to the local police departments since he used to work in the county sheriff’s department. ‘During his conversations with Zimmerman, Zimmerman never asked… what not to say during his interviews with the police,’ the police report states. ‘(Mr Osterman) stated Zimmerman did not understand the process and his only advice to Zimmerman was to tell the truth. ‘He described Zimmerman as a person of strong character, but not very street wise. ‘He has never known Zimmerman to be in a fist fight.’ Safe house: This is the Osterman home in Lake Mary, Florida where Zimmerman stayed for six weeks . A number of the interviews released by the FBI and the FDLE show that hundreds of acquaintances and family friends were asked if they thought Zimmerman was racist, and Mr Osterman’s interview only briefly touched on the issue. Support: Osterman accompanied Zimmerman to every police interrogation about the Martin shooting . At the time of the interview, Zimmerman was hiding out at Mr Osterman’s house, and Mr Osterman told interviewers that ‘Zimmerman is frustrated with the new Black Panther party and is very scared of them.’ ‘Zimmerman is very concerned with all the negative reaction from the press and others and wants more evidence released to show what really happened.’ Mr Osterman’s dubious employment history is also included in the notes. During his time as a deputy at the Seminole County sheriff's office, he was pressured to quit after he and another officer were fooled into working as security guards for a con man. The man, named Juan Diaz, approached Mr Osterman and another officer saying he was a second baseman for the New York Yankees and asked them to work as his body guard while going to strip clubs and bars in Florida. Mr Osterman resigned in 1998 after an administrative panel suggest he be fired because they did not get the bureaucratic approval to work an off-duty security shift. Since 2001, he has worked for the Department of Homeland Security as an air marshal, and on Facebook he describes his job as involving ‘lots of shooting and traveling’. Other interviewees said that they thought the neighbourhood watchman was ‘a soft guy’ who had a ‘little hero complex’ but did not believe he was racist even after he fatally shot unarmed teenager Travyon Martin. The investigators heard a number of different accounts from Zimmerman’s friends, including one who said the shooter told him that Martin mounted him and tried reaching for his gun while saying ‘You’re gonna die now mother*****!’","Mark Osterman was named as a friend that was interviewed by Florida police officials to give details about his friendship with George Zimmerman .

France's new socialist government is to pass a law making it illegal to arrest Britain-bound migrants flooding into Calais. The proposed legislation comes after the country's highest court ruled illegal immigrants cannot be held in custody for having no identity papers. It is feared the new rules - due to become law in the autumn - will unleash a fresh tide of migrants on the northern French coast hoping to sneak on lorries and ferries to Britain. France's new socialist government, led by President Francois Hollande (left), is to pass a law making it illegal to arrest Britain-bound migrants flooding into Calais. On Monday, Socialist MP Stéphane Saint-André (right) cut a red ribbon to declare a refugee camp dubbed 'mini-Sangatte' open . 'Mini-Sangatte': The wooden prefabricated huts currently have around 50 asylum seekers living in them . President Francois Hollande's ruling . left-wing party has also allowed the construction of 'refugee chalets' close to Calais which have been dubbed a new 'mini-Sangatte' - the . notorious Channel migrant camp closed down ten years ago. The . cluster of pre-fabricated buildings already have 50 migrants living in . them, and sources in the Pas de Calais department have said more migrant . chalets are set to be built. The . latest ruling by the Court of Cassation earlier this month means their . inhabitants are now free to make repeated attempts to sneak across the . Channel without fear of arrest. Originally a hangar for storing drilling equipment when the Channel Tunnel was under construction, the Sangatte camp began sheltering refugees in 1999 and was open for three years. The centre was initially handed over to the Red Cross to offer shelter to people, mainly families, fleeing the Balkans. That population was supplanted by people fleeing Afghanistan and subsequently Iraqi Kurds. Eurotunnel claimed it stopped 18,500 refugees trying to smuggle themselves into Britain in the first half of 2002 alone, the vast majority of whom were from the camp. In 2002 then home secretary David Blunkett and France interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy reached an agreement to shut it down. Despite the closure of the centre at the end of 2002, the problem remains, with refugees arriving in Sangatte every day. France's new interior minister Manuel Valls is keen to provide accommodation for the migrants in the area. After the election of the socialist government this spring work began on the new camp at Norrent-Fontes. Migrants can only be detained for up to six hours while police attempt to establish their identity. Even . if they are found to be in France illegally, the new law will state . they cannot held in secure detention centres but must be allowed to walk . free. The law will affect . around 1,000 illegal immigrants massed on the northern French coast, and . up to 60,000 across the whole of France. French . interior minister Manuel Valls said: 'The decision handed down by the . Court of Cassation forbids from now on placing people in custody on the . sole motive that they are here illegally. 'The prime minister has asked me to draw up a legal text as soon as possible to give this ruling a legal foundation.' The law would come before parliament in the autumn, a spokesman for Mr Valls added. The announcement has been hailed as a 'victory for human rights' by refugee groups in France. Agathe . Marin, spokeswoman for the Cimade refugees' association, said: 'Until . now, the police have been arresting and detaining immigrants on a . massive scale. 'After they . are detained, most of these people are released anyway. We hope that . this ruling will ensure that the police are respectful of immigrants' basic rights and stop treating them like criminals.' Since . the bulldozing of the Sangatte camp in 2002 - which acted as a stepping . stone for an estimated 50,000 migrants to reach Britain - numbers of . illegal immigrants in Calais have been gradually falling. The Red Cross-run centre which housed refugees at Sangatte, near the French terminal of the Channel tunnel was closed by Nicolas Sarkozy in 2002 . Waiting game: Refugees line up inside the former Red Cross-run housing center at Sangatte in 2000 . Former . president Nicolas Sarkozy ordered the destruction of a squalid woodland . camp known as the Jungle in 2009 and bussed almost 300 refugees out of . the area. A year later, another 100 migrants were removed from a woodland encampment in the Channel coast town of Teteghem. But . it is now feared the socialist's 'gentler' approach to illegal . immigration could see thousands more migrants flooding back to Calais. A . right-wing town councillor who asked not to be named said today: 'We . spent a decade trying to clear up this problem that has blighted our . town. 'Now with several strokes of the pen, the left-wingers in Paris and making it much more attractive for them all to return.'","Proposed legislation comes after France's highest court ruled illegal immigrants cannot be held in custody for having no identity papers .

Shyly peeking out from the shelter and safety of their den, four rare newborn Asiatic lions had their first glimpse of the British sunshine as excited staff at Paignton Zoo in Devon unveiled their new mane attraction. The cute cubs, born on May 15, stayed close to their proud mum Indu as they took in the sights of the Devonshire outdoors. The zoo kept the arrival under wraps until the cubs had survived the critical first weeks of their lives. The newborn cubs peer out of their den at Paignton Zoo where they were born in May as part of an endangered species programme . Roarsome: the shaggy siblings stick together as they step into the sun . Indu will mother her babies until they are at least a year old, before they are sent to other zoos as part of an endangered species programme. Keepers are keeping their distance for now to allow the family to bond, so it will be a while before they can announce the sex of each cub. The zoo's operations director and curator of mammals Neil Bemment said: 'We have been letting her get on with being a new mum - so far she seems to be doing really well. 'We are cautiously excited. if she is successful then it will be thanks to a lot of care and attention from the keepers. It is very good news for the species.' Mum Indu was born at Paignton Zoo in 2003 while dad Mwamba was born in 2004 at Leicestershire's Twycross Zoo. The pair have attempted to breed before but this is their first success - a cub had to be put down in June 2011 after it was found to have spinal defects. The species is distinct from their African lion relatives with a shaggier coat, lighter colour and folds of skin on the belly. Mother's pride: The rare cubs have made it through the critical first weeks of life and are sure to be the MANE attraction when they are revealed to the public . A tentative tail first! Asiatic lions are notoriously shy and Paignton Zoo's latest arrivals were reluctant to leave the safety of the den where they were born . They enjoy socialising but live in smaller prides than their African cousins and tend to hunt without the adult male of the group, feeding on wild antelope, deer, pigs and cattle. Asiatic lions once joined Roman gladiators in fights in the Colesseum but are now fighting off the threat of extinction from hunting and the destruction of their habitat. The endangered lions are only found in the wild in the Gir National Park and Lion Sanctuary in India.Scientists say they are rapidly outgrowing their home there and experts have drawn up plans to relocate the animals to the neighbouring state of Madhya Pradesh. But the Gujarat state government have refused permission for the move, with critics accusing them of wanting to protect the income the state receives from tourists wanting to admire the magnificent animals. Experts estimate their numbers as roughly 411 big cats, including 150 adults. Captive lions can live to be 24-years-old while their wild counterparts have a life expectancy of 17-18 years. The last Asiatic lion cubs to be born in the UK were an early festive present for Bristol Zoo in 2010 as twins Jay and Kaly arrived on Christmas Eve to mum Shiva and father Kamal.","Paignton Zoo welcomes four unbearably cute Asiatic lion cubs as part of endangered animals breeding programme .

Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney built his $250 million fortune with the help of two of Britain's most disreputable business figures - Guinness fraudster Jack Lyons and crooked newspaper boss Robert Maxwell. In the 1980s both men invested large sums in the Republican candidate's first private equity fund, started during his years at Bain & Company, which launched his now highly controversial career in finance. Romney is under increasing pressure to release details of his business affairs including tax returns for the years before 2010 and details of offshore holdings, including a Swiss bank account. Flamboyant publishing tycoon Maxwell was the former head of the left-wing Mirror Group newspapers and a one-time owner of the New York Daily News. He died in mysterious circumstances in 1991 at the age of 68 after falling overboard from his luxury yacht off the Canary Islands after which it was discovered he had plundered hundreds of millions from an employee pension scheme. Lyons, who died in 2008, was one of the notorious 'Guinness Four' convicted for a massive share trading fraud in which they attempted to inflate the price of Guinness shares to assist a take-over bid for Scottish drinks company Distillers. He was subsequently fined £4 million for theft and false accounting and stripped of his knighthood. In 1984 Lyons, a former colleague of Mr Romney's at Bain & Company, along with members of his family invested almost $3million in Mr Romney's capital fund. He then recruited Maxwell who invested $2 million in the fund. Both Lyons and Maxwell kept money in tax . havens and the latest revelations will be a blow to Romney whose . financial career is increasingly being brought into question. Romney has claimed his fortune and career history is proof of his ability to run the country. But Barrack Obama has accused him of tax dodging and profiteering from the destruction of companies. Investors: Crooked newspaper boss Robert Maxwell (left) and convicted fraudster Jack Lyons (right) both invested in Mr Romney's first private equity fund . Scandal: Daily Mirror workers demonstrating, after £458million had been looted from the companies pension scheme by the late owner Robert Maxwell . Mr Romney was a senior management . consultant at Bain during one of the most controversial periods in the . firm's history when they became caught up in the Guinness scandal as . advisers to the drinks firm. Bain Capital, the firm's investment arm, was set up by Mr Romney in 1981 and run from his Boston office. Lyons . was hired to help set up a British office and became the fund's first . investor with a $2.5 million stake via a front company in Panama. According . to the Daily Telegraph Yorkshire-born Lyons reported back to Boston . that he had signed up his friend Maxwell. On the attack: Barrack Obama has accused Romney of tax dodging and profiteering from the destruction of companies . One Bain executive based in London at the time told the paper: 'Jack took an interest in Bain almost as if we were his sons. 'He wanted us to succeed in the UK and he introduced us to a lot of people . . . I remember attending a luncheon in London with Robert Maxwell.' Around $12 million was invested by Bains partners including Mr Romney who is believed to have put up at least $160,000. Among the funds other investors were families from El Salvador who were later linked to Right-wing 'death squads' who murdered thousands during the country's civil war. The fund was phenomenally successful, and according to a prospectus, yielded an average return of 173 per cent a year on stakes in 21 firms. One investor told the Telegraph: 'Every couple of years I would get a cheque. 'It was always a lot more than I had put into it'. In 1986 Lyons joined a group of Guinness allies buying up stock in the firm in an attempt to boost the share price prior to a takeover bid for rival firm Distillers. It was a success and at the time Bill Bain, the firm's founder and Mr Romney's mentor, wrote to  Lyons saying: 'We are all delighted and look forward to hearing the story of how you managed to pull it off.' Lyons and three others were later convicted of theft and false accounting. Lyons avoided jail due to ill health. but he was stripped of his knighthood and CBE, and fined £4 million. Although there is no suggestion that Mr Romney, nor anyone at Bain in Boston had any knowledge of the wrongdoing a Bain employee in London described the period as 'traumatic'. He told the Telegraph: 'Mitt was just another partner watching this thing unfold.' Another British former colleague described him as 'bloodless' adding 'He was the sort of person that you would admire rather than like, and I think that continues to bedevil his political career.'","Newspaper boss Robert Maxwell and Guinness fraudster Jack Lyons invested millions is Republican's first equity fund at Bain & Company .

A wealthy businessman has admitted spending 20 years posing as a distinguished Royal Navy Captain claiming he risked his life for his country during the Falklands War. Stuart Elliott, managing director of a Hull-based gas turbine company, boasted about being a veteran who served aboard HMS Coventry, a destroyer . sunk during the Argentine conflict with the loss of 19 crew. For two decades he turned up to memorial services decorated in medals and in full uniform, recalling stories about the ships he commanded - and even duped Falklands hero Simon Weston who he invited to open his firm's new premises in East Hull, in 2006. He also claimed he had served in two Gulf Wars. However, the bogus seaman was not quite as clever as he thought he was. Bogus: Stuart Elliott is pictured dressed as a naval captain wearing medals from the Falklands war but a veteran noticed his medals were in the wrong order and one ribbon was upside down (circled) Correct: These are the colours of the Navy service ribbon awarded to veterans of the 2003 Iraq War which go khaki, grey, white, red, khaki, but Elliott had his upside down so the colours were the wrong way around . His fantasy was exposed when an . 87-year-old veteran noticed he was wearing his medals in . the wrong order and that one ribbon - awarded to veterans of the 2003 . Iraq war, was displayed upside down. In reality, the most the . father-of-three had done was to serve on a Hull tug-boat set to 'mop up' debris left over from the Falklands war. He was sent to the islands to . relieve the crew of the Irishman some three weeks after the invading . Argentine force surrendered to British forces. However, following a police . investigation it has emerged that he will not face any criminal charges. Despite admitting his deception, he has escaped with a police . warning. The punishment has sparked fury among those he duped, including genuine war veterans and Mr Weston who was invited to open Mr Elliott's business. Duped: Stuart Elliot, left, with Falklands hero Simon Weston, who attended the opening of his business believing the businessman was a decorated veteran . It is thought Elliott, a married 52-year-old, may have been living his lie for 20 years before officers . arrested him on suspicion of fraud and offences under the Uniforms Act . 1894. Elliott was convicted of drink-driving in 2010 and, when applying for his licence back, told the DVLA he was a Captain. Duped: Elliott claimed to have been a Falklands veteran, like hero Simon Weston who served in the conflict . Despite admitting his deception, Elliott escaped facing a court over his lies and was instead given a police caution. It was veteran Frank Stevenson who noticed he was wearing his medals in the wrong order and that one ribbon - awarded to veterans of the 2003 Iraq war, was displayed upside down. Mr Stevenson said he felt honoured when Elliott . approached him at the Rugby Tavern in Hull, East Yorkshire, following a . Remembrance Day parade at the city's war memorial in 2010. The veteran believed he was . talking to an officer and even asked a friend to take the snap of the handshake. Stevenson, a pensioner who rose . through the ranks to become a petty officer on board a warship, said he . felt sickened and ashamed at being duped by Elliott. He added: 'I don't think that man would have lasted long during the war. 'Captains are responsible for their crew and their ship. Back then, everyone was scared but you just got on with it. 'I was shocked and disgusted when I . saw the story in the Mail exposing him. He was certainly very convincing . and had the gift of the gab.' Stevenson's disgust at Elliott's . claim was echoed by veterans across the country who had been waiting for . the findings of the police investigation. Bob Reeves, honorary secretary of . the Royal Naval Association (Hull branch), said he had been invited to . an Armed Forces Day dinner, adding: 'It was a disgrace what he did. We . took him at face value and he lied to us.' Exposed: Elliott shaking hands with Frank Stevenson who realised Elliott had his medals displayed wrongly . A set of 'dolphins', as worn by members of the Royal Navy Submariners Service, was also sported by Elliott. Both Royal Navy and Military of Defence sources said they had no record of Elliott having ever served. After he was exposed, Elliott was branded 'Walt' - an abbreviation of the name 'Walter Mitty'.

"By . Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 07:35 EST, 24 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:41 EST, 24 July 2012 . The father of one of Ben Kinsella’s killers is suing police for £100,000 after claiming he was kicked in the face during the hunt for the teenager’s murderer. Michael Alleyne’s son, also Michael, is serving a life sentence for stabbing to death the 16-year-old brother of EastEnders star Brooke Kinsella in 2008, when he was just 18. Alleyne Jr was one of three men caged after Ben was brutally hacked down in the street outside a north London bar, sparking outrage and leading to an increase in minimum sentences for knife crime. Michael Alleyne Sr outside the High Court, where he is suing the Met Police after claiming he was kicked in the face during the manhunt for his teenage son . Now Mr Alleyne Sr, from Islington, says he was kicked in the eye and had his ankle broken when the Metropolitan Police bundled him to the ground after coming to his house looking for his son. He is suing for an estimated £100,000 in damages for the fractured ankle and eye injury he claims he suffered at the hands of police, as well as post traumatic stress. Anthony Seys-Llewellyn QC told the High Court that a team of officers forced their way into Mr Alleyne’s home on June 30, 2008, the day after Ben was murdered. The court heard Mr Alleyne’s dog was . tazered and sprayed with a fire extinguisher after it barked at officers . and Mr Alleyne was handcuffed on the ground. Terrible crime: Alleyne Jr was one of three men jailed after Ben was stabbed to death outside a north London bar . London Underground worker Mr Alleyne, who is in his early sixties, says he was then kicked in the face, causing his eye to swell up and eventually close over, and he felt a pain in his ankle as he lay on the floor. In documents filed at the High Court, he claims he was then paraded before a TV camera outside his home and detained for more than four hours without seeing a doctor. When he was allowed to go to hospital he was found to have a sub-conjunctival haemorrhage and retinal damage to his eye and a fractured ankle. He says he needed 16 weeks off work and has since suffered nightmares. His lawyers claim the conduct of the police officers was 'oppressive, humiliating, arbitrary and unconstitutional' and are demanding a six-figure compensation payout for alleged negligence, trespass, false imprisonment and assault. The Metropolitan Police denies . liability in the case. Mr Alleyne’s claims that he was kicked whilst . stricken on the floor are hotly disputed, with officers claiming that he . appeared to be struggling and needed to be restrained as part of the . murder probe. They argue that he was not detained during the investigation but was taken to a police station for treatment. Police lawyers told the High Court Mr Alleyne was lying about officer violence just as he had lied at his son's trial. Mr Alleyne, 62, was referred to a . statement he made shortly after the stabbing, in which he said his son . had gone out on the night of the murder. Tragic loss: Ben Kinsella, left, was killed aged 16, prompting his EastEnders actress sister Brooke, right, to campaign for tougher knife crime sentences . But, the court heard, Mr Alleyne later changed his statement to stay his son had stayed at home, an account he maintained when giving evidence at the Old Bailey trial in 2009. Dijen Basu, for the Metropolitan Police, said the claims that his son stayed in were false and showed that Mr Alleyne was prepared to lie on oath. Questioning Mr Alleyne, he said: 'I must put it to you that you are being as untruthful today as you were being at the Central Criminal Court.' Mr Alleyne did not answer the question after his lawyer intervened. Mr Basu added that Mr Alleyne's claim that police changed the first statement about his son's movements showed he was prepared to level false accusations at officers. 'The police officers who will testify at this trial are the brave men and women who deserve part of the credit for bringing Michael Alleyne [Jr] to justice for murder. They did not attack the claimant, negligently injure him, falsely imprison him or trespass on his premises', Mr Basu told the court. 'We expect and require police officers to take very great risks with their own safety and health in order to protect the public from people like Michael Alleyne Jr. 'On 30 June, 2008, numerous officers entered the claimant's flat not knowing if they would be attacked by desperate and violent men who had recently killed. 'The work of specialist homicide detectives in the claimant's flat and with the claimant contributed to bringing these men to justice. Thanks to the Metropolitan Police in this case, the public will be free of the risk these men pose until at least 2028.' The trial continues.

A defiant grandmother staged a three-day sit-in at her son’s stately home to stop bailiffs repossessing it. Stella Bond, 78, went without food or sleep for hour after hour in the library of the £2million property. As a team of security guards took  it in shifts to watch her – ready  to lock up the house if she ventured outdoors – Mrs Bond remained ensconced in her armchair at Halswell House, near Bridgwater, Somerset. Feisty: Mrs Bond was part of her son's property company in the 1990s, but retired five years ago . Halswell House owner Graham Bond bought the huge Somerset pile for £1.94m, but has been threatened with repossession after running into money trouble . And finally her resistance paid off . when the bailiffs were withdrawn, giving her son Grahame more time to . negotiate with US-owned Citi Private Banking. Mr Bond, 48, a former estate agent, bought the 17-bedroom house for £1.94million in 2004. He then spent £800,000 restoring  it . as an upmarket wedding venue. But its future was placed in doubt when . his property firm ran into financial difficulties. The stand-off took place after representatives of the bank turned up unannounced to seek possession of the property. Sit-in: Mrs Bond, 78, said she would not move from the house until the American bank proved they had the legal right to repossession . Mr Bond was not at home so his mother, a grandmother of four who lives in a converted stable block on the estate, stepped in. She said: ‘I was told that they were down at the house and my son was not here, so I came down to see what they were doing. ‘They could not show me paperwork . showing they had the right to take possession so I told them that they . had no right to be here. ‘When they said, “Well, no one is living here”, I said, “I can if you want”.’ Mrs Bond, who has osteoporosis and . suffered a stroke in 2006, took up her position in an armchair in the . library by a window overlooking the estate so she ‘could see who was . coming and going’ while a young carer remained by her side. Surprised by her resistance, the bank . called in a team of seven security guards to take it in turns to watch . the property, prepared to seize it if Mrs Bond left. She claimed that at one point during . the sit-in she called the police when security guards blocked the door . to the bathroom in an attempt to force her out of the mansion. ‘They were quite intimidating, but  I stayed put. ‘One man was very irritating. He thought he could move me by talking to me, but of course he couldn’t.’ Divorcee Mrs Bond, a former bookkeeper . who moved to Somerset when she was evacuated from London as a child . during the Blitz, said she was determined not to back down and let the . bank take the home her son had worked hard to restore. ‘It was very uncomfortable,’ she said. ‘I hardly ate a thing because I was very upset and anxious for them to . go and I didn’t sleep a lot, but I’m a strong character. ‘It took a lot of hard work to restore . this house, it was so dilapidated. My son had a dream for a long time . to put a stately home back together again. It is beautiful – I was not . going to let it go.’ Security men from American firm Citi Private Banking attempted to repossess the 300-year-old stately home last week . She added: ‘I cannot keep very active as I have had a stroke which affects my walking, but I don’t sit in a chair all day. ‘I walk about as best as I can and do housework, cleaning, cooking. Anything I can do, I do it.’ Mrs Bond said she is fond of the . house, but that her eight years on the estate was marred by an incident . in 2009 when it turned out that a masked ball at the house had been . arranged by a swingers’ group and degenerated into an orgy. Her son, whose property company has . gone into administration with debts totalling £11million, hopes to work . with Citi Private Banking to find a way to secure the future of the . property. He is also in dispute with the bank . over a five-bedroom mansion in Glebe Place, Chelsea, which he has rented . out to celebrities, including David and Victoria Beckham. He said: ‘You try to keep financial . difficulties from your mother but she has said No, she wants to be . involved and she has found  this quiet strength to absolutely take on my . case.’ Mr Bond added: ‘We have some real difficulties but Halswell is only closed temporarily.’","Stella Bond, 78, stages three-day sit-in against security firm .

A pilot flying a small plane with a marriage proposal banner attached crashed into the Block Island Sound Monday after an engine failure. Though pilot Mark Simmons was miraculously unharmed, the proposal wasn't made. Mr Simmons bravely took to the skies only one day after his harrowing crash, again toting the banner, which read, ‘Michelle, Will You Marry Me? Mike,’ which was commissioned by Mike Flynn, who wanted to propose to his girlfriend, Michelle. Michelle, who was curious why her boyfriend was pacing the beach for two days in a row, was shocked by the romantic gesture - and said yes to his proposal. Scroll down for video . Success: Mike Flynn, left, successfully proposed to his girlfriend Michelle, right, after pilot Mark Simmons took to the skies a day after he crashed . Words of love: The banner reads: 'Michelle Will You Marry Me?

Mr Simmons had terrible luck Monday when the engine on his Piper Pawnee cut out, and he was left to make an emergency landing in the Sound. But he courageously took to the skies yesterday to finish the job he started, showing his 8-year-old son Ethan that it was important to get up after falling, according to ABC 6. Ethan sent a message to the Coast Guard after his father let out several mayday calls. He played an integral part in his father’s rescue. Mr Flynn was on a nearby beach. He told ABC News that he was ‘really worried’ the entire time, and was pacing back and forth. Mr Simmons was rescued by a Good Samaritan who was passing by on his boat, and was unharmed. Mr Flynn told ABC News that the pilot rang him up with an apology, and a request: to try the proposal flight another time.

Connecticut’s The Day reported that he lost power 10 minutes into his flight. The Coast Guard, hearing his call, sent out a helicopter and a response boat. Mr Simmons’ son Ethan helped the Coast Guard quicken their search, telling them that his father had just taken off. Meanwhile, Mr Simmons was preparing for the crash landing. He told The Westerly Sun that he removed his seat belt and grabbed a floating tire. Help: The Point Judith Coast Guard sent out a rescue boat, but Mr Simmons had already been rescued by a Good Samaritan . Even though he was calm and prepared, he told the paper: ‘Nothing prepares you for sitting in the ocean by yourself.’ By the time the Coast Guard arrived, Mr Simmons had already been rescued from the Block Island Sound by a civilian boater. Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Bryan Swintek told the Day that the Good Samaritan pulled him from the water near Ninigret Pond, near Charlestown, Rhode Island. Lt. Swintek said that Mr Simmons was taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation, but was not seriously hurt. ‘He was incredibly calm,’ Lt Swintek said. But Mr Simmons’ plane was not so lucky.

A six-year-old boy is critically ill in hospital after being found trapped underwater by his inflatable rubber ring. The boy was rescued by a member of the public after he slipped through the middle of the ring he was wearing around his waist while playing in the sea at Portland, Dorset, on Wednesday. It is not known exactly how long he was trapped under the water before the swimmer spotted him and came to his aid. Rescue: The six-year-old boy was airlifted to hospital by the Portland coastguard helicopter after being found trapped under the water in the sea off Chesil Cove . The six-year-old was not breathing when he was carried back to the beach at Chesil Cove, and another bystander began performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on the child before ambulance paramedics arrived and took over. They managed to resuscitate the child, who has not been named, and he was flown to Dorset County Hospital at around 7pm on Wednesday. Andy Jenkins, the duty watch manager at Portland coastguard, said the boy remained in a 'very poor state' in hospital. 'As far as we know the child possibly slipped through a rubber ring and somehow had gone underneath it and remained stuck under the water,' Mr Jenkins said. Dramatic scenes: A medic descends from the Portland coastguard helicopter - the Dorset beach was evacuated so the air ambulance could land . 'We don’t know how long it was before people noticed what had happened. 'The initial report we received from the ambulance service was that a child had been pulled out of the water and wasn’t breathing. 'The last we heard from the hospital was he is in a very poor state. 'This was such an awful and unusual thing to have happened. 'If they (inflatables) are used then people need to keep an eye on them and, in the case of rubber dinghies, attach a line to them.' The shingle beach at Chesil Cove was evacuated last night to allow the Portland coastguard helicopter to land. A woman who lives nearby, who asked not to be named, said: 'My house is opposite the beach and I saw loads of police cars, the coastguards and the helicopter so I went out to have a look. 'I heard a boy had got into difficulty in the water. 'The helicopter landed on the beach and picked up the boy but I wasn’t close enough to see what state he was in or if his parents were there,' the woman added. A spokesman for Dorset police said: 'Our officers were called to a report of a child struggling in the water. 'The child, a six-year-old boy from Hampshire, was recovered from the water and treated at the scene by members of the public. 'He was taken to hospital where he remains in a serious condition. There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding this incident.' A spokesman for the South Western Ambulance Service said: 'We got a call at 6.58pm to Chesil beach to a six-year-old boy who was on the beach with breathing difficulties. 'We treated him on the beach and he was taken to the Dorset County Hospital by coastguard helicopter.' The boy was later transferred to the Southampton General Hospital which has a specialist neurological unit.","Child thought to have slipped through the middle of an inflatable ring around his waist and become trapped underneath it .

Shaun Clee is chief executive of Gloucestershire's 2gether NHS Foundation Trust, and chairman of the Mental Health Network . With his staff facing pay cuts and redundancies, it might have been wise for Shaun Clee to show a little more sensitivity. Instead, the NHS chief executive went on Twitter to show off his new pride and joy  – a £10,000 speedboat. Some of his staff follow his account on the social networking site and were outraged and insulted by his ostentatious purchase, made during a summer trip to Cornwall. Mr Clee, 52, chief executive of the 2gether NHS Foundation Trust, has signed up to a consortium of health trusts reviewing staff pay and conditions in an attempt to reduce costs by 2013. All staff earning more than £21,000 could face a pay cut, with reduced leave and bank holiday pay. Sickness and unsociable hours pay could also be slashed. Under his Twitter username Pictoontwit, he told his 407 followers: ‘Round-trip to St Austell, sea trial resulted in a new boat – oops!’ Tim Coupland, an NHS worker in Gloucestershire, then asked: ‘As in the purchase of a new boat?’ And Mr Clee replied: ‘I am afraid I have to plead guilty.’ The father of three, who lives in a £650,000 detached house in Worcester, went on to describe his purchase as a fast ‘day boat’ for inshore or river fishing. He then posted a picture of what is believed to be his boat on his Twitter page, before adding: ‘Relaxing with a nice glass of something is definitely the order of the day.’ His 27-year-old daughter Ellen replied: ‘Nice, but we were hoping for something we could holiday on!’ Mr Clee responded: ‘That sounds like a lottery win wish.’ 'Oops!': This picture tweeted by health trust boss Shaun Clee is believed to be the boat he purchased after a trip to Cornwall . As boss of the trust, which provides mental and social healthcare in Herefordshire and Gloucestershire, Mr Clee earned between £140,000 and £145,000 last year. The boat in the picture is a Raider Boats 16 Cuddy, believed to be about 12 years old and worth around £10,000. John Nicholson, managing director of Raider Boats UK, said: ‘The 16 Cuddy is purely a leisure fishing boat and this particular model could reach up to 30mph, maybe more.’ Mr Clee’s gaffe stunned workers who face an anxious few months to discover whether their pay will be slashed. Employees who fail to agree to the proposals could be made redundant and forced to sign new terms of employment. 'Regretful': Mr Clee's tweets about his new boat were met with anger from some staff at the 2gether NHS Foundation Trust . Chris Moore, co-ordinator for the local campaign group Stroud Against The Cuts, said: ‘At a time when NHS staff are being told their pay and conditions are under attack, it is outrageous that management can behave in this way. It shows a complete arrogance of management.’ A worker at the 2gether Trust, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘It seems insulting to people who follow him. I believe it shows poor judgment. ‘Staff want a leader who they can look up to and admire. People are absolutely incensed. You shouldn’t put it in other people’s faces.’ Mr Clee, who is married to wife Sarah, has 32 years experience in the NHS and moved into management in 1990. A spokesman for the 2gether Trust said: ‘The timing of the message on Mr Clee’s Twitter feed was regrettable as we appreciate staff have concerns around our membership of the pay consortium.’ He added that there were no formal proposals to consider and discussions with staff would continue.","Health trust boss splashes out on new purchase as anxious staff await outcome of pay review .

A 19-year-old man has been arrested by police after two suspected 1.2milion-volt stun guns disguised as mobile phones were found in his car. The alleged weapons are 24 times more powerful than the average police Taser gun and can be fatal if discharged.

The devices, which look like Nokias, are believed to be K95s and have electrodes in the top. Operated by pressing a button on the side of the device, the weapons can disable victims with a million-volt charge. The man was arrested on suspicion of possessing a prohibited weapon last Wednesday, and was bailed until September. There was a woman with him but she was not arrested. The suspected weapons are now being examined by forensic teams to discover what exactly they are. Anyone found in possession of one of these stun guns in Britain faces up to ten years in jail and an unlimited fine. Seized: A police officer examines the suspected weapon. Operated by pressing a button on the side of the device, they can disable victims with a million-volt charge . In February, police forces across Britain were warned to be aware of a flood of the high-powered stun guns disguised as phones which were being smuggled into the country. Authorities fear that the stun guns – marketed as personal protection devices – are increasingly becoming the criminals’ weapon of choice, with at least 10,000 estimated to be in circulation on Britain’s streets. They are also becoming a threat to . prison guards. A Chinese-made Kelon stun gun – identical to a Sony . Ericsson K95 mobile phone – was recently found at Low Newton jail, where . the mass murderer Rosemary West is an inmate. Although illegal in Britain, the stun guns can be bought via the internet for as little as £15. The . slightest touch against a target is enough to deliver the charge, . either direct on to skin or through clothing. In extreme cases they may . cause fatal heart attacks. Investigation: In February police were warned stun guns were being smuggled into the UK. The devices above are being examined by forensics at the moment . UK Border Agency officials have seized the devices at Manchester and Glasgow airports and at a North London postal sorting office, raising fears that they are being imported in growing numbers. Jail staff say the guns could be used to temporarily paralyse wardens. A senior prison source said earlier this year: ‘These stun guns pose a dangerous new threat. There are fears they will be smuggled in to aid escapes and intimidate warders.’ The devices are marketed on websites as ‘non-lethal personal security weapons’ for defence against muggers.

The 32-year-old divorcee, who cannot . be named for legal reasons, was due to appear before a judge in the city . of Avignon after being arrested on Friday. His most recent alleged attack was on an 11-year-old girl on Wednesday. Arrest: The entrance of a campsite in Saint-Didier-sous-Aubenas, France. The arrested man claims to have carried out sexual assaults on five girls in the area . The man broke into a tent where two children were sleeping, before nearby adults were alerted by screaming. Victims were able to draw a sketch of the man who is described as ‘bearded and suntanned’. ‘He acknowledges having taken part in . at least five attacks,’ added public prosecutor Franck Alzingre, who . said the man had regularly preyed on young families across the region. ‘He confessed to attacking the . 11-year-old girl, and to similar assaults in the southern Ardeche. Five . sites were targeted in all.’ Attack: A major investigation was launched following the rape of an 11-year-old girl in a tent at a campsite in the southern Ardeche region . Mr Alzingre said victims, who were of a number of nationalities, were in the age range seven to 12. There had been earlier claims that . the man had raped the children involved, but Mr Alzingre said . prosecutors were now using the general term ‘sexual assault’. Mr Alzingre, who is a prosecutor in . the town of Privas, said the charges were so serious that he was . relinquishing jurisdiction to the Avignon prosecutor. He said that evidence against the attacker was corroborated by a range of compelling evidence, including DNA. The suspect, who is a divorced Frenchman, was arrested on Friday at 7pm close to his home in Brune, a small village near Privas. Neighbours have reported seeing child pornography including images of rape on the man’s computer. Police believe the man carried out all the attacks by posing as a holidaymaker who was staying on the campsites. More than 20,000 British people . travel by car to the Ardeche every year, many to take advantage of the . cheap accommodation at some 337 campsites.

She spent £7,350 of the stolen money before her father realised it had gone . As the daughter of a well-to-do  businessman, Tegan Doidge enjoyed all the benefits of a comfortable, middle-class upbringing. She came from a loving home in a picturesque hamlet, close to paddocks where she could ride the family’s horses. But in a shocking turn of events, the once-privileged 19-year-old ended up sleeping rough and has now been locked up for stealing £7,500 from her parents. Doidge, who claimed on Facebook that she had been a student at Oxford University, was given a two-month sentence for breaking in to her family’s £300,000 country home and stealing the cash from their bedroom. Her father, John Doidge, 50, who runs his own business contracting company, called police after realising the money was missing. When Doidge was finally tracked down, the teenager was found with cannabis and just £150 left of the money. Before her arrest, she had been living rough near her former home in Ottery St Mary, Devon. Doidge, who admitted burglary, was originally given a community order but was resentenced at Exeter Crown Court this week after failing to carry out 120 hours’ unpaid work. As she was sentenced to two months in a young offenders’ institution, her mother Melanie, 42, sobbed in the public gallery.

He said: ‘It seems you are somebody for whom the clang of the prison gate will have a salutary effect. ‘You need to have the situation you have created brought home to you in a short and sharp manner.’ This week’s hearing was a second . chance for Doidge. After being sentenced to community service in . February she failed to attend and was brought back to court in May when . she was given another chance to do the hours.

Archeologists can spend a whole career exploring and never uncover a worthy find, but one lucky student has discovered an archeological . treasure chest and he is still only 23. Darren Joblonkay was digging at an archeological camp in southeastern Turkey when discovered an impressive 3,000-year-old statue of King Suppiluliuma. The enormous sculpture which is preserved from the waist up stands almost 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall, suggesting that its full height with legs would have been between 11 and 13 feet (3.5 to 4 m). Discovery: Darren Joblonkay, 23, was digging at an archeological camp in southeastern Turkey he found the two-tonne statue of King Suppiluliuma laying face down in the dirt . The presence of colossal human statues, often astride lions or sphinxes, in the citadel gateways of the Neo-Hittite royal cities of Iron Age Syro-Anatolia continued a Bronze Age Hittite tradition. It accentuated their symbolic role as boundary zones, and the role of the king as the divinely appointed guardian or gate keeper of the community. By the ninth and eighth centuries BC, these elaborately decorated gateways, with their ornately carved reliefs, had come to serve as dynastic parades, legitimizing the power of the ruling elite. The gate reliefs also formed linear narratives, guiding their audiences between the human and divine realms, with the king serving as the link between the two worlds. Source: University of Toronto . 'At first, we weren’t 100 per cent sure what it was,' said Mr Joblonkay, a 23-year-old University of Toronto graduate student told the Toronto Star. The regal figure was found at what would have been a gate to the upper citadel of the capital, Kunulua. The complex would have provided a monumental ceremonial approach to the upper citadel of the royal city. Tayinat, a large low-lying mound, is located 35 kilometres east of Antakya (ancient Antioch) along the Antakya-Aleppo road. Proud: Darren Joblonkay with the Tayinat statue he uncovered at an archeological camp in Turkey . Alongside the statue, archaeologists . found another carving, a semicircular column base bearing the images of a . sphinx and a winged bull. More than 60 workers were drafted in to uncover . the two-tonne statue of the man who reigned over the Neo-Hittite kingdom . of Patina in the 9th century B.C. After two weeks hard graft they finally unearthed the statue - the . figure’s face is bearded, with beautifully preserved inlaid eyes made . of white and black stone, and its hair has been coiffed in an elaborate . series of curls aligned in linear rows. The pieces have been dated to between 1000 B.C. and 738 B.C. Unearthed: Alongside the statue, archaeologists found another carving, a semicircular column base bearing the images of a sphinx and a winged bull . 'These newly discovered Tayinat . sculptures are the product of a vibrant local Neo-Hittite sculptural . tradition,' said Tim Harrison, professor of near eastern . archeology at the University of Toronto and director of the Tayinat Archeological . Project. 'They . provide a vivid glimpse into the innovative character and . sophistication of the Iron Age cultures that emerged in the eastern . Mediterranean following the collapse of the great imperial powers of the . Bronze Age at the end of the second millennium BC,' he added. This was the third of Mr Joblonkay's four major archeological finds. 'He’s very lucky,' said Professor Tim Harrison. On the king's back the inscription reads: 'I am Suppiluliuma.' It is followed by a list of his . accomplishments: taking land from eight neighbouring kingdoms, . establishing a border, and building a monument to his father. Mr .

Natalie Creane, 33, was knocked unconscious in her hotel room when a loose panel fell from her wardrobe and struck her on the forehead. The freak incident left her in a coma five times and she now has a serious form of epilepsy, causing her to suffer violent seizures and sudden collapses. Medics have had to put her into the induced comas to treat her injury, and have warned that she could die if she suffers another large seizure. The human resources director's family are locked in a legal battle with the hotel's bosses, who they believe should accept liability for the incident and pay compensation. They say the injury has transformed her from a fit and healthy young woman to someone who is unable to even bathe herself. Mrs Creane, originally from Kelvedon Hatch, Essex, was injured in 2008 while she and her then fiance Trevor were staying at the luxury Emirates Palace hotel in Abu Dhabi. The couple, who have since married, . had moved to the UAE to start a new life and had booked a weekend at the . hotel to celebrate their engagement. Mrs Creane has been treated in a Dubai hospital 40 times since the incident happened - including 20 stays in intensive care. Mr Creane, 42, said: 'We are all terrified for Natalie. She is in such a state and has been through so much. 'She will need rehabilitation, treatment, potentially surgery, and we don’t know if it will work or what the future holds. 'The doctors have warned us that she may not survive another large seizure.' Mrs Creane's parents Derek and Angie . Smith, of Kelvedon Hatch, said they were close to financial ruin because . the legal battle, which began in 2010, has proved so costly. They . initially avoided drawing attention to their daughter's plight for fear . of compromising the legal process, but have now broken their silence.

George Zimmerman is all but broke and will ask the court to pay for his legal defense, his attorney claims -- despite the fact that the 28-year-old has raised nearly $250,000 through his website. Defense lawyer Mark O'Mara made the remarkable claim at a press conference on Monday, where he said months of death threats have forced Zimmerman and his wife to blow through most of their cash on security and day-to-day living expenses. Mr O'Mara also said the former neighborhood watch volunteer will not use the 'stand your ground' defense in the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in February -- opting instead for a traditional self defense claim. Out of school: Documents revealed that Zimmerman withdrew from Seminole State College about a month after the shooting . Zimmerman's lawyer will ask the judge to declare him indigent -- a legal term that means he cannot afford the cost of his own defense. He $50,000 left from his donations and about $20,000 in outstanding bills, the Orlando Sentinel reported. 'He really has to live as a hermit, unfortunately,' Mr O'Mara said. 'He's not doing well. He's getting by.' The defense lawyer said he has been paid 'zero' by Zimmerman and will represent him for free. However, Zimmerman still needs to cover the cost of expert witnesses, court transcripts and a private investigator. Court records show money has poured into a PayPal account that Zimmerman set up to raise money for his legal defense. In April, he raised $1,000 a day and $64,000 on its best day. Defence: Zimmerman is represented by attorney Mark O'Mara, center, seen walking to the Seminole County Court . Donations have since slowed to a trickle. An interview with Fox News commentator Sean Hannity and the roll out of a new website haven't increased the cash flow. The case, Zimmerman's shooting of an unarmed black teenager at a gated community in Sanford, Florida, set off a national debate about race, self-defense and gun laws. Zimmerman claims he killed Trayvon only after he was attacked by him and feared for his life. Supporters say he has been the target of thousands of death threats and massive unwanted media attention. Prosecutors argue Zimmerman followed Trayvon because he was black and then murdered him. Since the shooting, O'Mara said, Zimmerman has been forced to flee his home and hide out in an undisclosed location. This has meant he and his wife can't work and must live off of the legal defense fund donations, Mr O'Mara said. Court records show he and his wife spent $135,000 on car payments, credit card bills, cell phones, cable Internet and bulletproof vests. The announcement about Zimmerman's financial problems comes after Mr O'Mara announced he would not employ the infamous 'stand your ground' defense.' Evidence: Zimmerman has said that Martin broke his nose and slammed his head into the pavement, which corroborate with the Sanford police department's photos from that night . He said looking at the case through traditional self-defense circumstances is appropriate because the facts suggest his client couldn't retreat from a beating he was receiving from Martin. 'The facts don't seem to support a `stand your ground' defense,' O'Mara said on Monday. Still, he did say that the defense team will try to get the case dismissed during a `stand your ground' hearing. 'My concern with even calling it a ""stand your ground"" hearing is we need to be more realistic,' O'Mara said. 'I've said from Day 1 we need to wait until all the evidence comes out.' O'Mara said he thinks people have a perception about the law that isn't accurate. Killed: Trayvon Martin was shot and killed the night of February 26 in Sanford, Florida, by George Zimmerman . 'People look at `stand your ground' and immediately think somebody's standing there with deadly force - be it a gun or a weapon - and having the opportunity to back up but not having the need to under the statute,' he said. 'I think the evidence in this case suggests that my client was reacting to having his nose broken and reacted to that by screaming out for help. 'He wasn't in position where I think there was any suggestion where he could retreat, which he is allowed to do under the statute.' If a judge were to side with Zimmerman in a pre-trial hearing under the state's self-defense statute, the murder charge would be dismissed immediately. Legal battle: Zimmerman, pictured right at an April 20 bond hearing, will fight the charges against him using Florida's 'stand your ground' law .","Raised $1,000 a day in April and $64,000 in a single day from a PayPal account on his website .

A retired lorry driver has spent four years painstakingly recreating a 'wildly expensive' copy of the doomed Titanic's wireless room. The iconic White Star liner plunged to the bottom of the North Atlantic after striking an iceberg on its maiden voyage on April 14, 1912, resulting in the loss of 1,502 passengers and crew. The Marconi wireless room, which was used to send distress signals during the terrifying sea tragedy, has now gone on show at Swaffham Museum, Norfolk, for three months. Because now, in the year of its 100th anniversary, it has been recreated. The original: This is a picture of the ship's original radio room, taken by Frank Browne on April 12, just 48 hours before the great liner sank . Attention to detail: Ted Sinclair is seen here with his astonishing labour of love - a perfectly recreated Titanic room . Retired lorry driver Ted Sinclair, 71, of nearby Beachamwell, embarked on a labour of love to produce the early 20th century maritime communications centre. The Titanic enthusiast said: 'It has been a real labour of love because the parts are wildly expensive. 'Where possible I have used original pieces from the time.' Mr Sinclair bought most of the items for his incredibly lifelike replica by trawling through eBay including a silver plated brass lamp dredged up from the seabed near the doomed ship. Some 12 copies of a brass handle with an original White Star Line design were also made for the desk. Back to life: Mr Sinclair spent years looking through eBay to find the most realistic - and sometimes genuine - pieces for his replica . Unthinkable: Mr Sinclair said: 'It has been a real labour of love because the parts are wildly expensive' James Cartland and Sons, which had a large foundry in Birmingham, made the original handle and James Cartland was the grandfather of late popular author Barbara Cartland. At the time of the catastrophe the cutting edge equipment in the wireless room, which sent Marconigrams, was state-of-the-art and was mostly made from wood or brass. Mr Sinclair said: 'While the system had been used for eight years, the shipping companies didn't take it that seriously to exchange information about icebergs. 'It was not part of their safety system. 'What they liked about it was the well-off clients could send messages from the ship to the shore. 'It would be quite pricey.' The retired lorry driver spent a painstaking four years collecting the pieces, including a silver plated brass lamp dredged up from the seabed . Harold Bride, seen here, the junior radio operator, desperately sent out SoS pleas for help from the wireless room . Sending a message from the Titanic's wireless room on the boat deck cost 12/6d for the first 10 words and 9d for each word after that. At today's prices, an average Marconigram would cost a staggering £50 to dispatch. Mr Sinclair's faithful display was inspired by a photograph taken by first class passenger the Rev Frank Browne. Mr Browne got on at Southampton before disembarking at Queenstown, Ireland, now called Cobh. The Jesuit priest was staying on 'A' deck and took pictures around the ship, including the wireless room at 10.10am, on April 12. Senior ship radio operator Jack Phillips, 25, and Harold Bride, 22, the junior radio operator, desperately sent out SOS pleas for help from the wireless room as Titanic went down. Mr Phillips was killed but Mr Bride miraculously survived. Titanic's sister ship, the Olympic, responded, but was too far away and the SS Carpathia, a passenger steamship, arrived four hours after disaster struck. Mr Sinclair said terrified radio operators fired off more than 20 signals as the 'unsinkable' 46,000 ton giant foundered south of Newfoundland. A back-up system which ran from batteries was used after the power supply failed 30 minutes before the Titanic sank. Thrilled Sian Hogarth, heritage development officer for Swaffham Museum, said: 'I think the display is amazing. 'It is a huge undertaking because Ted has got it so right and I admire him for doing that.' The Titanic leaving Southampton on her ill-fated maiden voyage on April 10, 1912 . She added: 'It is a lovely tribute to people who were lost on the Titanic and Ted's encyclopaedic knowledge compliments it.' The wireless room featured in the Titanic exhibition at the Forum in Norwich in April to mark the Forncett Industrial Steam Museum disaster's centenary and briefly at Forncett Industrial Steam Museum, Norfolk. Mr Sinclair, who has been bewitched by the Titanic since he was a schoolboy, said: 'The disaster was a bit of a turning point. 'Afterwards, the powers that be brought in regulations for equipping ships with radios.'","Painstaking effort took four years to create communications room .

A Boy Scout leader of a New York-based troop is recovering after being savagely attacked by a rabid beaver at the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in Pennsylvania. Normand Brousseau, 51, of Pine Plains, New York, was swimming in the river with a floating device known as a 'noodle' when the beaver latched onto his chest. After being bitten and clawed at several times, Mr Brousseau was finally pulled to shore by Nick Hedges, 16, who joined his three fellow Scouts in pelting the deranged creature with stones until it died. Brave: Troop 32 from Elizaville, New York was on a field trip to the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in Pennsylvania when Nick Hedges, 16, (third from left) was forced to pull his leader to safety . Mr Brousseau has received over 20 rabies shots and is said to be recovering well since being treated at Pocono Medical Center in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. The assistant scoutmaster had been co-leading a field trip in the Dutchess County park when he felt the animal between his legs in the water. Savage: A Boy Scout leader was set upon by a rabid beaver in the Delaware Gap and was bitten and clawed until members of his troop hauled him to shore and killed the animal . Recalling the moment the beaver attached itself to his chest, he told the Poughkeepsie Journal: 'I thought it was a giant carp fish.' But any such thoughts of over-sized goldfish were soon dispelled as the beaver took a bite at him. Hero: Nick Hedges and his fellow boy scouts threw stones at the beaver until they had killed it . Grabbing hold of his aggressor and . attempting to cast it away from his body proved only a temporary . solution as the rabid creature came back for more, biting at his leg, . buttocks, arm, hand and waist. By then, Mr Brousseau explained, 'the adrenaline kicked in.' 'I . grabbed it in its mouth,' he said. 'I had it around its bottom jaw as . tightly as I could because I knew it was going to either bite me or bite . the boys. I called the Scouts to come give me a hand.' Mr Hedges of Elizaville, New York, was the first on hand to help the victim and while keeping a careful eye on the beaver, pulled his leader to shore. Safely on dry land, Mr Brousseau hurled the beaver up onto shore where it turned its attention to the noodle and began ripping it apart. 'We started throwing rocks at it,' Mr Hedges recalled. 'We could see it was still dangerous.' While . the young men wrestled with the beaver, passing canoeists offered to . take Mr Brousseau to the other side of the river and to get help and . another park visitor witnessing the scene called 911. Mr . Brousseau has dismissed the praise bestowed upon him from parents of . Troop 32's members saying he did what he had to do to keep the boys . safe. Nevertheless, . Susan Treacy of Stanfordville, whose 15-year-old son, Zach Pruner was . also on the trip, said: 'It was very brave of him. Who’d be crazy enough . to hang onto a rabid beaver?' Dutchess . County health officials meanwhile claim that an attack from a rabid . beaver is unusual and locals to the area struggle to recall the last . time something like this happened. A river runs through it: Health officials in Dutchess County say such a vicious attack from a rabid animal is very rare though visitors to the park should always be aware of signs of rabies like unusual and aggressive behaviour . The attach, however, follows a similar incident in Virginia's . Spotsylvania County in July where eight-year-old Annabella Radnovich . and her 11-year-old sister, Alyssa, were playing with their cousins at . Lake Anna when a 65 pound beaver bit and scratched their legs. Stephen Capowski, director of environmental health services for Dutchess County urged people to look out for signs of unusual behaviour among animals that can point to rabies such as sightings of nocturnal animals in daylight hours or aggressive behaviour between domesticated pets. Mr Brousseau confessed: 'I’m pretty sore' but said he has learned a valuable lesson from the incident. 'When you go out into nature, you always need to veer on the side of caution,' he said. 'Don’t assume a wild animal is not sick. You have to be on your toes at all times.'","Assistant scoutmaster receives 20 rabies shots following ordeal .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 22:57 EST, 14 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:57 EST, 14 August 2012 . A Delaware pediatrician who researches near-death experiences involving children may have been experimenting on his 11-year-old stepdaughter by waterboarding her, police said in court documents. The possible link between Dr. Melvin Morse's research and the waterboarding allegations was revealed in an affidavit for a search warrant for Morse's computers. According to the affidavit, Dr. Melvin Morse brought the girl 'to a possible near death state from the simulation of drowning.' 'Abuse': Dr Melvin Morse, left, allegedly held his daughter's face under a running tap to 'waterboard' her as a punishment while his wife Pauline, right, watched and did nothing to help her . 'This waterboarding that he has performed ... would fall into the area of study he practices,' police said in the affidavit. 'It is logical that he has therefore written about and/or researched the topic of waterboarding.' Joe Hurley, an attorney for Morse, . said the idea that Morse was experimenting on his own daughter is 'the . sheerest of speculation.' Morse, who faces a preliminary hearing . Thursday on felony child endangerment and conspiracy charges, has . authored several books and articles on paranormal science and near-death . experiences. He has appeared on Larry King Live and . The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss his research on out-of-body . experiences. His website is strewn with commentary about God, love, . family and death. Morse told AP in a telephone interview . Monday that the charges against him are an overreaction from . authorities who were criticized in the wake of a child sex abuse scandal . involving another pediatrician. Morse said he is the victim of . 'post-Bradley hysteria,' a reference to pediatrician Earl Bradley, who . was convicted a year ago and is serving 14 life sentences for sexually . abusing scores of his young patients over more than a decade. Eminent: Dr Morse, right, was interviewed by Larry King, left, about near-death experiences in children . High profile: In 1992, he was also interviewed by Oprah Winfrey, pictured holding up a copy of his book . Following Bradley's arrest in December . 2009, state officials ordered investigations into how he was allowed to . continue practicing medicine for years despite suspicions that he was . molesting his patients. Lawmakers passed several new laws . toughening requirements for police, health care workers and others to . report suspected child abuse. The allegations of waterboarding came . after Morse was accused of grabbing his 11-year-old stepdaughter by the . ankle in July and, as her 6-year-old sister watched, dragging her across . a gravel driveway. He was arrested July 13 on misdemeanor endangerment and assault charges and released on bail. When the older girl was interviewed . last week, she told investigators that her father disciplined her by . holding her face under a running faucet at least four times since 2009, a . punishment that she said her father called 'waterboarding.' Waterboarding simulates drowning and . it has been used in the past by U.S. interrogators on terrorism . suspects. Many critics call it torture. Research: He has written the above books after interviewing children declared clinically dead . State police said the girl's mother, . Pauline Morse, witnessed some of the waterboarding but did not stop it. She is also out on bail. Melvin and Pauline Morse were both charged with felony child endangerment and conspiracy. 'All of these things are very absurd, except that Delaware has really had the trauma (of Bradley),' Morse told the AP. Morse, 58, ended the interview before he could be asked directly about the waterboarding allegations. Mr Hurley, the attorney for Morse, has raised doubts about the girl's claims. He has described the waterboarding . description as an 'attention-getter' by authorities, based on an . allegation from an 11-year-old who he said had made a false abuse claim . against a family member before. 'Cruel': Morse is a pediatrician and has co-authored books on near-death experiences in children . Frightening: The girl told social workers that her father, left, said she could last for five minutes under the water without getting brain damage. Her mother Pauline, right, has been released on bail . 'I have no doubt but that the Bradley . phenomenon has its fingerprints all over the sensationalization of this . situation,' Mr Hurley said. State officials suspended Morse's medical license after his arrest last week. Morse, who was released from custody . Friday after posting $14,500 secured bail, claimed he was 'the first . doctor to blow the whistle on Earl Bradley.' Morse said he warned state officials . in 2007 that Bradley was using saline solution to give fake vaccines to . his patients, though state officials said they never received a report . from Morse until after Bradley was arrested in 2009. 'I reported that, and I'm the only . Delaware physician who had the courage to testify for the Bradley . victims,' said Morse, claiming that he gave a deposition in the Bradley . case.","Dr Melvin Morse, 58, 'held girl's head under tap and her mother did nothing'

Horrific: Trevor Roberts, 68, was discharged from hospital without being told he was suffering from terminal cancer . A man was discharged from hospital without being told he was suffering from terminal cancer. Trevor Roberts, 68, returned home completely unaware of the seriousness of his condition. He continued to feel desperately unwell and only found out he had terminal lung cancer after being taken to another hospital where the news of his condition was revealed. He died just days later without ever returning home. Yesterday the hospital responsible apologised to his family saying there had been ‘errors in communication.’ But . last night his family said they were still reeling from the ‘appalling’ oversight and had been left ‘heartbroken and angry’ by the shocking . mistake. His daughter Sharon Taylor, 46, said: . ‘Because we didn’t know his condition was so grave, my dad’s . grandchildren were abroad on holiday in Turkey and were unable to say . goodbye before he died. ‘The whole family is heartbroken about that and still coming to terms with it. ‘If . action had been taken sooner, my dad could have been given more time . with his family and would have had the opportunity to come to terms with . his illness, put his affairs in order and say goodbye.’ Mr . Roberts from Tyldesley, Greater Manchester, died six weeks after first . visiting his GP in July 2009 following his concerns about painful lumps . he had developed across his body. The retired warehouse supervisor was referred to the Royal Bolton Hospital where on August 1 he was admitted for tests. A . complete set of tests was carried out which revealed he was suffering . from cancer and that the disease had spread throughout his body and was . terminal. But despite the diagnosis, neither the patient nor his family were informed about his condition. He . was allowed to go home two days later but continued to feel desperately . unwell and on 16 August he was taken to the accident and emergency . department of the Salford Royal Hospital. Awful: The pensioner only found out he had terminal lung cancer after being taken to another hospital where the news of his condition was revealed . Once there a doctor broke the news to Mr Roberts that scans he had previously at the Royal Bolton Hospital showed he had terminal lung cancer. Mr Roberts’ wife Margaret and children, Sharon, Martin and Paul, had hoped to take him home to spend quality time together. But they were advised by doctors that he was too frail to survive the eight-mile journey and he died at the hospital just five days later. His daughter Mrs Taylor, from Astley, near Wigan, said: ‘My dad was a devoted husband, father and grandfather and an important figure in all our lives. ‘The rapid deterioration in his health took us all by surprise and we feel absolutely devastated about losing him so quickly and in such circumstances. ‘The Royal Bolton Hospital NHS Foundation Trust made no attempt to contact us about my dad’s condition and the terrible results of the scan after he was discharged, which we are really angry about.’ Worrying: Tests at the Royal Bolton Hospital revealed Mr Roberts was suffering from terminal cancer but neither the patient nor his family were informed about his condition . She said: ‘We accept the cancer was too severe to treat with surgery or chemotherapy, but if doctors had shared information about his condition earlier he could have also received access to palliative care to make his life more comfortable. ‘We accept the Trust’s apology and are reassured that staff have changed their processes to ensure other families will not have to go through the same ordeal in future.’ Dr Jackie Bene, medical director at Bolton NHS Foundation Trust, said in a statement: ‘We fully accept that there were errors in communication made in Mr Roberts’ case in 2009 and have apologised to his family. ‘We realise that we can’t alter the outcome for them, but we examined the circumstances carefully so that we could learn from where we went wrong. ‘This was a very sad situation that no family should have had to go through and which we regret deeply.‘ . [Please leave Irwin Mitchell quote] Sarah Sharples, the family’s solicitor at Irwin Mitchell law firm, said: ‘The lack of communication between departments is appalling. ‘The Trust’s apology has been noted and we hope that staff have taken this on board to ensure that, particularly in cases where patients sadly have little time left, test results are acted on.’","Trevor Roberts, 68, was admitted to the Royal Bolton Hospital for tests after concerns about painful lumps which had developed across his body .

A woman jumped to her death from a bridge because she was plagued by a skin condition that caused her face to redden. An inquest heard how Vicky Norfolk, 31, had suffered from rosacea, which  can look like a rash, for several months and was struggling to cope with her change in appearance. Despite support from her family, the shop assistant descended into depression and resolved to take her own life. Vicky Norfolk was driven to suicide after struggling to cope with her chronic skin condition . Tragically she was successful on her third attempt, leaping from the Humber Bridge in Hull in February last year. Miss Norfolk’s family said her mental health had deteriorated in a matter of weeks. They want to highlight the lack of immediate counselling for people suffering depression. Miss Norfolk’s mother Anne, 58, said: ‘We don’t feel there were enough resources in place to help her combat that depression. It occurred literally over a matter of weeks and with very little acknowledgement from our GP.’ The inquest in Hull heard how a month before her suicide Miss Norfolk cycled to the bridge and climbed over the railings. Off-duty police officer Mark Osborn spotted her as he was cycling across and persuaded her not to jump. ‘She said she was very sad and depressed and decided to come to the bridge to commit suicide,’ PC Osborn told the inquest. The following month, Miss Norfolk returned to the bridge but decided against jumping. Tragedy: Vicky threw herself off of the Humber Bridge over the River Humber near Hull, East Yorkshire . More than six million Britons have rosacea. Famous sufferers including former US President Bill Clinton and Ricky Wilson from rock band Kaiser Chiefs. Rosacea causes facial redness and spots on the forehead and cheeks and around the mouth and nose, which can look red and swollen. Surveys show seven in ten sufferers feel rosacea has sapped their confidence and affected their working life, while two in five have avoided being seen in public and cancelled social plans. One in three admit to calling in sick at work because of the condition. Treatments include antibiotics as well as laser therapy. Although the condition is incurable, treatments work best if the condition is caught early. Dermatologist David Fenton said the biggest danger was the damage to self-confidence. ‘Professional help should also  be sought if someone is over- focusing on the problem,’ he said. ‘Even the most loving family is not equipped to deal with this.’ Days later PC Osborn cycled back over the bridge and saw Miss Norfolk’s bike in almost the same place as before. But this time she was not there. The next day, her mother went round to her house accompanied by police officers and found a note in the kitchen. Miss Norfolk’s body was found 12 months later after a dog walker spotted her remains. Speaking at the inquest, Mrs Norfolk said her daughter had been a happy and warm person but had become obsessed with her skin condition in the months that it developed. She added: ‘She struggled to look past it, even though it was only visible if you looked closely. ‘As a family, we tried everything to help and it is heartbreaking that we couldn’t reach out to her.’ Mrs Norfolk told how she had gone with her daughter to see doctors on two occasions in the months leading up to her death. She said: ‘Vicky was good at covering up the fact she was suffering from depression but, over time, she couldn’t see anything else in the mirror any more.’ Delivering a verdict of suicide, Coroner David Rosenberg said: ‘While she might have been stable, it was clear Vicky was suffering from depression. ‘My verdict is that she took her own life while the balance of her mind was disturbed.’ Mrs Norfolk added: ‘Mental health is such a secret killer and we hope that if any good can come from her death, it will be to emphasise the need for greater understanding, acceptance, time and investment when dealing with these problems.’ For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 or visit a local Samaritans branch, see www.samaritans.org for details.","Vicky Norfolk threw herself off the Humber Bridge because of her rosacea .

Jackson has been on a secretive medical leave since June 10, . when family members said he collapsed at their home in Washington. He is . currently being treated for bipolar disorder at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, . Minnesota. But neither his office nor family members have said much about his medical . condition. The visit from Kennedy - who has suffered with bipolar . disorder and been treated at Mayo - gave one of the first outside glimpses of . Jackson's health. A friend indeed: Former U.S. Rep. Patrick J.

Stay the course: During an hour long visit on Thursday, former Rhode Island U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy, who had suffered with bipolar disorder, encouraged U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. to take time to heal . 'I don't think people understand the depth of his . depression. It's deep. He has a lot of work to continue to do to be able to . learn how to treat this illness in the most effective way possible,' Kennedy . told The Associated Press. 'Depression is a serious thing, and I'm glad that . he's taking it seriously.' Kennedy also suggested Jackson had an initial reluctance to . receive help for his illness. The congressman's wife, Sandi Jackson, . issued a statement through spokesman Kevin Lampe about Kennedy's visit: 'My . husband is grateful for his friendship. He and Jesse have a long history in . Congress together.' Jackson's spokesman declined to comment on Thursday, and it's . uncertain when Jackson can return to work. Last week, an aide said the . congressman could be expected back at work in a matter of weeks. But after the . Mayo Clinic released a detailed diagnosis of his health, his spokesman declined . to comment. Jackson's father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, also has declined to speak . on the topic. Kennedy, who served with Jackson on the House Appropriations . Committee, left Congress last year. He has been an outspoken advocate for mental . health and spoken publicly about his own struggles. He's said he and Jackson have similarities: They both come . from famous families and have suffered from the same disorder. ''I don't think people understand the depth of his . depression. It's deep. He has a lot of work to continue to do to be able to . learn how to treat this illness in the most effective way possible' 'It was clear we both had the same feelings of dejection and . self-doubt and being in a situation where we thought we had let people down and . let ourselves down,' Kennedy said. 'It's going to take him some time to . heal.' Kennedy called Jackson a resilient person with 'terrific . self-awareness' and said he was confident Jackson will come back from this. 'He recognizes the challenges that he faces. That's a big . step on the long road to recovery. He's doing the work so he can take that . journey forward,' Kennedy said. 'He's getting stronger and he's getting the . support he needs to put together a program of recovery.' Kennedy added that . Jackson's family had been to visit him many times. Former U.S. Rep.

His office remains open for . constituent services, and his aides have continued communication with officials . in his district, which includes parts of Chicago and its southern suburbs. His office initially described the condition - two weeks . after he went on leave - as treatment for exhaustion. Later, it was referred to . as a 'mood disorder.'

Kennedy said it appeared that Jackson wasn't initially ready . to acknowledge that he needed medical care. 'He's been through kind of a metamorphosis. The notion that . he was getting mental health care was very distasteful,' Kennedy told the AP . after the visit with Jackson, which lasted more than an hour Thursday afternoon. 'He did not want to acknowledge that this was the kind of help he needed. It . took a public outing.' In their few public comments about his illness, family . members have pointed to the stress of Jackson's job and the political . disappointments over the years. Jackson, who first won office in 1995, once had . his sights set on being a U.S. senator or Chicago's mayor. But those were dimmed . in the wake of allegations that Jackson was connected to imprisoned former Gov. Rod Blagojevich.

A former butler insisted on his . innocence and said he's scared to go to jail as he was sentenced today . to 20 years in prison for trying to extort millions of dollars from . philanthropist Anne H.

March of attempted extortion and other charges, said at his sentencing . hearing that he had no role in the ordeal suffered by Bass and her . companion at her western Connecticut estate - where she was injected with what masked intruders . claimed was a deadly virus during a night of terror in 2007. 'I am sorry for what they went through . but I didn't do it,' said Nicolescu, who paused and fought back tears as . he spoke at length in federal court in New Haven. Emanuel Nicolescu, left, was convicted of trying to extort millions from socialite Anne Bass, right, by holding her captive in her home in 2007 and injecting her and her boyfriend with a mystery potion . Nicolescu noted that he is only 150 pounds. 'In jail I'm a target for a lot of things,' he said, asking for mercy. 'I'm scared.' Authorities said the masked men injected . Bass and her partner, Julian Lethbridge, and refused to provide an . antidote unless they turned over $8.5 million. The injected substance . turned out to be harmless, and the intruders fled without the cash. 'This lengthy sentence is appropriate . for a defendant who participated in a violent home invasion,' said U.S. Attorney David Fein. Alex Hernandez, an attorney for the victims, said the crime was profound and long-lasting. 'The perpetrators executed this crime . with military precision and left no doubt about their intentions,' Hernandez said, reading a victim impact statement. 'The terror they . inflicted was real and was clearly intended to be perceived as such. Anne and Julian believed that each moment could well be their last.' The victims, who did not attend the . sentencing, also live in constant fear that others involved in the crime . have not been captured. They said they hope Nicolescu will help . authorities bring the others to justice. Anne Bass and her longtime artist boyfriend, Julian Lethbridge, pictured here at a 2010 event, were held for 12 hours in the terrifying home invasion at her sprawling country estate in Kent, Connecticut . 'To date, he has not accepted any . responsibility for what he did, he has expressed no remorse for what . took place and he has done absolutely nothing to help bring others to . justice,' the letter states. 'If he should now choose to do so, he will . have earned a measure of forgiveness from them.' Nicolescu is the only person who has . been arrested for the crime at the estate in Kent, a scenic rural town . of about 3,000 residents near New York. He had been fired by Bass for . wrecking a car about a year before the crime on April 15, 2007. Authorities say at least four men were involved, including one outside the house. The jury did not reach a finding on the . role of Nicolescu or the others, so it's unclear whether they believed . he was in the home, outside or elsewhere, said his attorney, Gerald . McMahon. A prosecutor said the jury did not make special findings as to . Nicolescu's role, but authorities have argued they believed he was in . the house. Prosecutors said Nicolescu's DNA was found in a Jeep stolen from the property during the home invasion.

'I spent a lot of time thinking about my . children and how horrible it was going to be for them because I was . sure I was going to die,' said Bass, whose grandson was unharmed.

Speaking out: Jacqui Janes, pictured holding a portrait of Jamie, believes parts of her 20-year-old son's body were retained without her permission . A mother whose Guardsman son was killed by a Taliban bomb in Afghanistan has called for an inquiry after discovering parts of his body ‘went missing’ following his return to Britain. Jacqui Janes believes 20-year-old Jamie’s arms and hands were retained without her permission. When her son’s coffin was opened so she could take a lock of his hair, she was shocked to discover that his arms and hands had been replaced by padding under his uniform. Yet a post-mortem report mentioned injuries to both arms and hands, and even noted a tattoo of his girlfriend’s name on one arm. Mrs Janes, 49, has . repeatedly raised her concerns with the Ministry of Defence over the . past three years, but has never received the answers she desperately . needs. She has only broken . her silence now that the Royal Military Police have admitted breaking . rules and keeping the body parts of other dead soldiers at the John . Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford – where her own son’s  post-mortem . examination was held. When . Jamie died in 2009, then Prime Minister Gordon Brown famously misspelt . his name in a handwritten letter of condolence to his mother. But the . enduring question of why her son’s bomb-damaged hands and arms had been . removed without permission has caused Mrs Janes far deeper anguish than . the controversy over Mr Brown’s note. Yesterday, . the MoD announced that another soldier from Jamie’s unit, 1st Battalion . Grenadier Guards, was killed in Helmand Province on sentry duty. Jamie – a soldier from the age of 16 – died on foot patrol in Nad e-Ali, central Helmand, on October 5, 2009, blown up by an improvised explosive device which also wounded three of his colleagues. He was pronounced dead after failed resuscitation attempts on a rescue helicopter and at the field hospital at Camp Bastion. Afterwards, his body was escorted by the military police’s Special Investigations Branch (SIB) from the operating theatre to the mortuary at Camp Bastion and on his repatriation flight to Britain, arriving on the morning of October 9. Once his body had been repatriated at RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire on the same day, it was transported by the SIB to the John Radcliffe Hospital. The Mail on Sunday has seen documents confirming that a Sergeant Griffin of the SIB accompanied the remains in a sealed bag which was opened at the hospital and identified to Warrant Officer Andrew Bishop, of the SIB’s Forensic Department.   The body was stored in a secure refrigerator, awaiting a post-mortem examination by Home Office pathologist Dr Nicholas Hunt. Dr Hunt’s report of October 12, 2009 – seen by this newspaper –recorded multiple wounds and referred to Jamie’s hands and left arm being badly ‘disrupted’ – a medical term meaning the normal shape had been altered after layers of tissue were blown apart. And in his ‘descriptions’ he makes note of ‘a tattoo which appeared to read “Kelly” running vertically down the outer aspect of the left upper arm’. There were also mentions of injuries to forearms, elbows, wrists and fingers. Afterwards, Jamie’s body was photographed and routine DNA tests carried out. On October 16, SIB officers took the body to Albin International, a repatriation and funeral company contracted by the MoD. There, Jamie was dressed in his ceremonial red tunic, white gloves and black boots. On October 19, Mrs Janes was driven to a London chapel of rest to see her son’s body for the first time, but she only glimpsed his head and shoulders as the coffin lid was only moved partway. Afterwards, his coffin was screwed shut. Shocking discovery: Jacqui Janes asked for her son's coffin to be opened when his body was taken to this Brighton funeral home, it was there she discovered his limbs were missing . She then drove in convoy with the undertakers from Albin’s chapel of rest to a local firm, Caring Lady of Hove. Wanting to take a lock of her son’s hair, Mrs Janes asked undertaker Angela Spencer to unscrew the casket lid. Mrs Janes, who has another son currently serving in Afghanistan, says when she looked inside Jamie’s coffin his hands and arms had ‘disappeared’. Her account is supported by Mrs Spencer. In the front room of Mrs Janes’s terraced home in Portslade in Brighton, on the edge of the South Downs, photographs of Jamie in his uniform are all around and his beret, medals and ceremonial belt hold pride of place in a glass case. On the coffee table, piles of documents attest to her three-year battle for answers from the MoD. ‘I wanted to bury all of Jamie,’ she said. ‘I think parts of him have been dumped somewhere. This is horrific, shocking. I won’t rest until I find out what they’ve done to him.’ How did the scandal of soldiers’ retained body parts come to light?An MoD whistleblower contacted the media to claim that at least 60 items of human tissue and major body parts of soldiers killed in Afghanistan were being illegally kept against the rules of the forensic department by the Royal Military Police Special Investigation Branch, both at their HQ and  Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital. What does the law say?Under the Human Tissue Act 2006, it is illegal to remove, store or use human tissue without consent, or to store tissue or organs for a purpose not stated. Penalties include a fine and up to three years in jail. Why was the Act brought in? The organ-retention scandal at Liverpool’s Alder Hey children’s hospital in 1999 brought issues such as consent and tissue use and storage under the spotlight. It became apparent that existing laws needed updating. Are the rules different for soldiers’ bodies?Post-mortem examinations on members of the Armed Forces killed in combat are carried out under the jurisdiction of a Home Office coroner. Tissue samples required as part of the investigation are retained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. The samples must be stored on behalf of the coroner until an investigation is complete and written instructions on the relatives’ wishes are received. What action has the  MoD taken? The MoD has refused to reveal if anyone has been disciplined over the scandal but says it has contacted the families involved to inform them and apologise. Mrs Janes’s doubts began as soon as Jamie was flown home. She said: ‘I was introduced to a lot of officers at Jamie’s repatriation ceremony at RAF Lyneham. I asked a lot of questions, about the incident and the state of Jamie’s body. ‘Eventually, they told me he had lost his legs but that he had arms and hands. They seemed very awkward speaking to me. ‘As we got closer to the funeral, I was getting more and more suspicious about what had happened to Jamie and what state he was in. Jamie’s officers were being evasive so I wanted to see for myself. ‘I also wanted a lock of his hair. So I asked Angela if she would unscrew the coffin, we could cut off some hair and check the body ourselves. ‘Angela removed the lid of the coffin and felt down Jamie’s arms and looked inside his gloves as I was standing next to her. There was padding where Jamie’s arms and hands should have been. She said: “Jacqui, I am sorry. I would like to tell you his parts are there but they are not.” ’ Mrs Spencer confirmed: ‘By feel and looking, I could tell there weren’t any limbs there. Removing parts of the body should not be part of the preparing or embalming process.’ Mrs Janes added: ‘I was devastated, as any mother would have been. What had they done with the rest of his body? I rang all the officers from Jamie’s battalion but I didn’t get any answers. ‘I received the post-mortem report in March 2010 and was horrified. What had happened to Jamie’s hands after they were inspected by Dr Hunt? I rang his office but I was told he was unwell. ‘Then I was watching the news  last week and I heard that the  Special Investigation Branch had been caught out retaining body tissue at the John Radcliffe Hospital, where Jamie was examined, and I thought: I am going to speak out publicly. I am not going to wait any longer for answers. As his mother, I am entitled to be told, even if it is an entirely appropriate process. What happened to these bits of him?’ A spokesman for the MoD said: ‘The MoD is dealing with this case as a matter of urgency and an investigation has been launched. Our foremost concern is always to support the families of the deceased and our thoughts and concerns remain with them. We make sure the return home of all our fallen comrades to their families is conducted with the utmost dignity and respect.’ The Mail on Sunday tried to contact Dr Hunt, but he was on holiday. A colleague  at the Forensic Pathology Services said: ‘We spend a lot of time ensuring where possible that all body parts are repatriated with the deceased for burial or cremation. We certainly would not just throw body parts away. A spokesman for Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs the John Radcliffe, said: ‘Forensic post-mortem examinations  on members of the Armed Forces killed in combat are undertaken under the jurisdiction of a Home Office coroner. ‘Tissue samples are stored in an entirely secure and respectful manner until no longer required by the coroner . . . and the families have expressed their wishes.’ A spokesman for Albin International declined to comment ‘due to the terms of our MoD contract’. Gorden Brown managed to turn a humanitarian gesture into a political catastrophe when he handwrote a letter of condolence to Mrs Janes in 2009. The then Prime Minister’s note was full of spelling errors, and most notably it began: ‘Dear Mrs James.’ He also spelt Jamie incorrectly and corrected it by writing over the last letter. The other mistakes were: Greatst for greatest, condolencs for condolences, you instead of your, and colleagus for colleagues. All PMs write to the next-of-kin of fallen troops but Mr Brown’s effort fuelled claims that he was being irreverent to Britain’s forces. At the time, Mrs Janes said: ‘It’s just disrespectful.’","Guardsman Jamie Janes, 20, was killed by a bomb in Afghanistan .

A nasal cancer patient has found a novel way of ensuring he does not misplace his prosthetic nose - by sticking it to the side of his fridge. Bert Eastham's nose was removed three years ago when it was found to contain cancerous cells. Last month the 64-year-old was fitted with a prosthetic nose - it is held on to his face using magnets. Novel storage: The prosthetic nose has magnets that attach to magnetic studs implanted in Mr Eastham's face - this also means it easily sticks to the fridge in his kitchen . Mr Eastham, from Chorley, Lancashire said: 'My new nose has given me a new lease of life but I was so worried we would lose it.' But after repeatedly buying fridge magnets as souvenirs from his holidays, Mr Eastham came up with a brainwave and now sticks his prosthetic nose alongside the others on the side of the fridge freezer before he goes to bed. 'I used to wear my nose to bed when I first got it, but one night it fell off and landed in one of my slippers, when I got up in the middle of the night, I stood on my own nose. I got the shock of my life. Keeping it safe: Bert Eastham wearing his prosthetic nose which was fitted last month . 'It was only when I noticed the fridge magnets in our kitchen that I thought I would test out whether my new nose would stick to the side too. 'Now if I’m cooking dinner, sometimes I’ll just stick my nose on the fridge next to the magnets because I don’t know when my nose is running and I wouldn’t want anything going into the food. 'Or if I’m at a party with my . friends, I’ll maybe stick it on the fridge just to lighten things up. I . can’t wait for the next time we go on holiday and go through security . because I’ll have to take my nose off - I bet they won’t have seen that . before.' Mr Eastham was diagnosed with nasal cancer in 2009, after noticing growths on his face. He . said: 'For a year I had two scabs at the entry of each nostril, which I . assumed were cold sores. I just used to pick them off - I didn’t think . it was anything serious.' The . sores were swabbed and Bert was prescribed antibiotics but in February . 2009, he was transferred to Preston Royal Hospital for a biopsy where he . was diagnosed with cancer. Mr Eastham, who . lives with his wife Olwyn, 62, an accounts manager said: 'I felt like I . was in a dream, you always know someone with cancer but you never think . you’ll be the one to get it. 'It was such a blow - I had been made redundant the month before, so it was already a difficult time.' Mr Eastham, . who has seven grandchildren, was told the operation would be the most . effective treatment so he agreed to go for it - even though his face . would never be the same. Replacement: Mr Eastham waited more than three years for his new nose, and it was fitted last month . Result: 'I burst into tears when I saw it for the first time - it looked so real', said Mr Eastham . He . said: 'I was told it would leave me very disfigured but would be the . best option to fight the disease. It was life or death - so I didn’t . care about losing my nose. 'I . wanted to carry on living and see my grandchildren grow up, that’s what . was important to me. I must have sat in the car outside the house for . 40 minutes thinking of ways to break the news to my wife. 'She . burst into tears - she wasn’t expecting it. She phoned our family who . came round, it was very emotional. They were all so positive and told me . they were behind me.' Mr Eastham on his 60th birthday before surgery . Mr Eastham underwent the operation to remove his nose and most of his upper lip on April 16, 2009, before receiving four weeks of radiotherapy in June. He said: 'It was all very quick - I was home the next day. I was looked after by a fantastic team of nurses who would come to change the dressing - I can’t praise them enough. 'The dressing was removed every day until it healed - but I just couldn’t force myself to look at it.' Although Mr Eastham had the confidence to go out with friends and to the shops within two weeks of his operation, it took him six months to look at himself in a mirror. He said: 'I refused to look. I thought I looked so ugly the first time I did, my stomach dropped. The vain man in me would have likened me to Paul McCartney - my hero - but I just looked so different.' 'I went back for the prognosis, it was the first time I’d seen the surgeon smile. He said it was good news and that I had the all clear. It was such a big relief, I just felt brilliant', he added. Up until four weeks ago Mr Eastham wore a triangular-shaped plaster on his face in a bid to improve his appearance - but he added: 'Teenagers would actually shout abuse across the street, they would be laughing and pointing at me. 'Adults would avoid me - when they saw me they’d hurry their kids across the road. Some people thought I’d been in a terrible fight and had brought it on myself. I felt ignored and was sick of people patronising me. 'But it didn’t stop me going out, my amazing wife helped me and told me I was better than them - I wouldn’t let them stop me getting on with his life.' Family support: Bert and Olwyn Eastham on their wedding day, 1971. He said his 'amazing wife' helped him dealing with his treatment . Surgeons operated to improve the appearance of Bert’s top lip last September and he was finally fitted with a silicon nose produced by Oral Maxillofacial Surgery UK last month. Technicians at the firm spent months designing and producing the prosthetic nose, which was a rare task for them, as they were used to creating eyes, nipples and ears. 'They looked at photos to create an exact replica of my nose and matched my skin colour perfectly. It is so life-like, the detail is incredible - there are even varicose veins.' Mr Eastham had waited more than three years for his new nose, which is held on with magnets. 'I burst into tears when I saw it for the first time - it looked so real', he said. Within the last months, his self-confidence has shot up and he is delighted. 'When I walked out of the hospital with my new nose, not one person looked at me. I felt normal again. Although I’ll never look the same, I am so pleased I can get on with my life', he said.","Bert Eastham, 64, had the prosthetic nose fitted last month after nasal cancer treatment .

A new suspect is set to be charged with murder over the killing of PC Keith Blakelock in the 1985 Broadwater Farm riots, it was reported today. Scotland Yard is poised to prosecute the man, who was under 18 at the time, in what has become one of Britain's most notorious unsolved murder cases. Sources told The Sunday Telegraph that after reviewing the evidence against the man, two QCs agreed there was a realistic prospect of conviction. PC Keith Blakelock, murdered during the Broadwater Farm riots in Tottenham, north London, in 1985 . Officially, Scotland Yard insisted last night that no final decision had been made and that detectives were not yet ready to bring charges. A spokesman said: 'The reinvestigation into the murder of PC Blakelock is ongoing. 'Regular consultation with the CPS has been taking place in relation to this case as is usual in all such investigations. 'We have not reached a decision regarding any charges against any individual.' The newspaper reported that sources believed the suspect was set to be charged within weeks. Detectives' confidence was said to have been buoyed by the conviction in January of Gary Dobson and David Norris for the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence. Police on the Broadwater Farm estate in north London, during the riots in which Pc Keith Blakelock was hacked to death . In 2005 detectives released this image of the uniform worn by PC Blakelock on the night he was murdered. The yellow tape shows where the knife strikes hit him . Aftermath: Substantial damage was caused. Here, the day after PC Blakelock was killed, police officers inspect the damge walking past burnt out houses and cars . The officers believe that if such a long-standing and legally complex case can be resolved then justice can also finally be secured for PC Blakelock. PC Blakelock, 40, was attacked as he tried to protect firefighters who were tackling a supermarket blaze at the height of the riot on October 6, 1985. After stumbling, the father of three was surrounded by a mob screaming: 'Kill the pig'. PC Keith Blakelock (left) was killed by machete during riots on the Broadwater Farm estate. Winston Silcott (right) was one of three men wrongly convicted of the murder in 1987 . Police hide behind riot shields as they come under fire from a mob during the 1985 riots . He was stabbed dozens of times and the machete-wielding killers then tried to decapitate him. A later trial heard the mob intended to parade the constable's head on a pole to taunt other officers. Winston Silcott, Mark Braithwaite and Engin Raghip were convicted in March 1987 of PC Blakelock's murder but all three convictions were quashed four and a half years later, after forensic tests on pages of key interview records suggested they had been fabricated. Silcott accepted £50,000 compensation from the Home Office but remained in prison for an unrelated murder and was released in 2003. None of the three men originally convicted is the suspect in the new case. In 2003, Scotland Yard reopened the murder investigation after a review indicated there were possible new lines of inquiry. It was revealed on the 25th anniversary of his murder, in October 2010, that 10 men had been arrested in London and Suffolk for questioning over the crime. All were aged in their 40s or 50s and had lived in the Tottenham area at the time of the riot. New forensic tests were carried out on PC Blakelock's flame-retardant overalls, which for years had been on show to criminologists and trainee police officers at Scotland Yard's 'Black Museum'. The garment and more than a dozen murder weapons - several machetes and a kitchen knife found embedded up to the hilt in the constable's neck - were analysed using updated DNA techniques for the first time. Evidence gathered by the new inquiry is also believed to include significant new witness statements.","Sources say two QCs agreed there was a .

An 88-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of aiding his ailing wife's suicide will not be charged with any crime, San Diego County prosecutors decided on Wednesday. Prosecutors determined that the case against Alan Purdy, arrested in March after admitting to being present during his wife's suicide and not trying to stop her, couldn't be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, said District Attorney Spokeswoman Tanya Sierra. The dropped charges come five months after Margaret Purdy, 84, was found dead in the couple's home after suffering for years over a number of ailments that had kept her bedridden. Grieving: Alan Purdy, 88, is seen before a painting of his late wife, Margaret Josephine, whose suicide in March led to his arrest on charges of assistance . Her death was ruled a suicide by the county medical examiner – her second attempt, her family said - with a suicide note written by her found nearby. Mr Purdy doted on his wife in her final years his family said but in the end he obliged to her request, taking a seat beside her as they said their goodbyes - her in her favourite chair. 'Yes, I sat beside her as she died,' Mr Purdy told the Los Angeles Times. 'I didn't want her to feel abandoned. I wanted her to know that I loved her.' Mr Purdy was arrested not long after her death when he called paramedics to their home, informing them that his wife had suffocated herself, the LA Times reports. He rushed paramedics to the scene, telling them that his wife had donated her body to the UC San Diego Medical Center and would need her organs harvested for transplant as soon as possible. Detectives pulled him aside for interviewing with Mr Purdy telling them precisely what he had told the paramedics: he was present when his wife died and admittedly did not try to stop her. Dropped: Charges against Mr Purdy, seen in his San Marcos home's living room where his wife took her life, were dropped on Wednesday . 'She had mentioned for some time that she was under a great deal of pain and that this was a very hard life,' said the couple's son-in-law John Muster at the time of Mr Purdy's arrest. 'It was a great life. I loved her dearly and I'm sorry she's gone. I'm not going to second-guess her choice,' he said. She had been bedridden in her final years from severe pancreatitis, an autoimmune disease, a crumbling spine and three fractured vertebrae that never healed. - Alan Purdy . Family members were opposed to the criminal charges against Alan Purdy, who was released on $15,000 bail following his arrest. 'I'm delighted to hear this,' Mr Purdy's daughter Catherine Purdy, a Berkeley psychologist, told the Times on Wednesday. 'I feel like justice has finally happened.' Her father, Ms Purdy said, 'is very lonesome and unhappy. He lost his wife, and then to have to wait for this decision — it's been very hard on him.' Married in 1997, after both of their previous spouses' deaths, the couple lived in the house Mr Purdy is now alone in for the last 15 years he said. They share five children together, all of which were contacted by Mrs Purdy before she took her life. They visited her, believing it would be their last time. Pronounced dead on March 20, it was just two months after she unsuccessfully tried to kill herself by carbon monoxide poisoning while her husband was away on business. He returned to find her in the garage with a car's engine running. He pulled her out he said and revived her. 'She was her own person,' Mr Purdy told the Times. 'She decided she was going to die by her own hand.' For confidential support call the Samaritans in the UK on 08457 90 90 90 or visit a local Samaritans branch, see www.samaritans.org for details.

Burying her face in the baby’s blanket, Sacha Parsons has her first and last cuddle with her beloved daughter. The harrowing photograph captures the precious moments Miss Parsons spent with Anais after the infant was stillborn. Just days before it was taken, midwives had told Miss Parsons that all was well with her baby. But it later emerged that they had missed vital signs that the foetus was critically under-developed. By the time they did notice, it was too late to save her, and Anais died in her mother’s womb two days before her due date. Heartbreaking: The harrowing moment Sacha Parsons cradles her stillborn daughter Anais who died in the womb two days before she was due to be born . Her parents released the . heart-wrenching photograph yesterday as they told of their anger at how . medical staff ‘played God’ with their child’s life. ‘Anais knew more love in her short stay with us than some children know in their lifetime,’ said Miss Parsons. ‘We just gazed at her all evening and wondered how we could have made something so beautiful and perfect.’ Following the baby’s death, the . hospital admitted mistakes had been made. Despite the fact that the . unborn child was under-developed, medical staff at Paulton Memorial . Hospital in Radstock, Somerset, repeatedly assured the expectant parents . that there was ‘nothing to worry about’. Miss Parsons, 39, said: ‘They . measured her as small and told me not to worry about it, played God with . my baby’s life and our little girl paid the ultimate price – her life. ‘I despise them. Their lack of care took our wonderful baby away from us for ever. ‘They may have taken away our one and only chance of having a baby.’ Never forgotten: Sacha Parsons and her partner Andy Cassidy with a box of keepsakes to remind them of their stillborn daughter . A parent's worst nightmare: The tiny coffin containing the body of baby Anais, who died two days before her delivery date . If Miss Parsons had been induced or . the baby delivered by caesarean and given specialist care, she may be . alive today. Instead,  the child was so weak that she died in her . mother’s womb two days before her due date and Miss Parsons was forced . to go through the trauma of a stillbirth. Following the ordeal, she was given a . few heartbreaking hours to say goodbye to her daughter, and partner . Andy Cassidy, 40, took this photograph. The couple, from Chilcompton, had . been trying for a baby for three years and suffered a miscarriage early . in 2010. When Miss Parsons conceived again in September of that year, . they were cautious, but doctors told them they were having a ‘textbook’ pregnancy and their confidence grew. Following scans at 36 weeks and 38 . weeks, three separate midwives told the couple that their baby was . small, but said they did not need to worry about it. 'They may have taken away our one and only chance of having a baby.' They later discovered that by the . 40th week, Anais was five weeks behind on her development. It was only . during the final check-up that a midwife raised concerns about the size . of the baby and immediately referred Miss Parsons for a scan. The following day, Miss Parsons felt . some unusual movement and had a wave of nausea. She now believes this . was the exact moment Anais died. She said: ‘I remember feeling some . very small movements in  bed in the morning, which was unusual. At lunch . time, for about 30 seconds I felt quite sick and had stomach ache. ‘I just put this down to being due any minute. I now know this was her way of telling me the exact time she had gone.’ In the wrong: Earlier this year Wiltshire Primary Care Trust - which ran Paulton Memorial Hospital (pictured) at the time - admitted a breach of duty . Empty: Sacha stands over the cot of her daughter Anais at her home in Chilcompton, Somerset . Grief: The couple are to receive compensation after the hospital accepted responsibility . Miss Parsons didn’t feel any further . movements all day so she went to the hospital for a check-up. She was . referred to another hospital for a heartbeat scan, which confirmed her . worst fears.

Communities Minister Andrew Stunell is due to announce details of the initiative in Tottenham, north London, where the riots started last summer, according to The Times. The area is set to host the first clubs – such as police, fire and ambulance cadets. Mr Stunell said: ‘If you go into middle-class areas you find middle-class scout groups and other uniformed youth clubs, but if you go to Tottenham they are much thinner on the ground. ‘Uniformed organisations give youngsters life skills, and, for some, the vital extra ingredient for them to make a success of their lives,’ he added. ‘They teach them to contribute to society rather than taking from it.’ Communities Minister Andrew Stunell is due to announce details of the initiative in Tottenham, north London, where the riots started last summer .

A former University of Virginia lacrosse player convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend lost his bid for a new trial today when a judge concluded there was ample evidence to support his conviction of second-degree murder. George Huguely V sat impassively during the two-and-a-half hour hearing as a judge rejected all defense motions seeking a new trial in the May 2010 slaying of his on-again, off-again girlfriend Yeardley Love, who also was a lacrosse player at the school. Huguely was convicted in February of beating to death the 22-year-old student from Baltimore. He was also convicted of grand larceny for the theft of her computer. Piled on the pounds: George Huguely V is escorted to court in Virginia today (left) where he lost his bid for a new trial. The murderer looking visibly slimmer ahead of being convicted in February (right) On the murder charge, Charlottesville Circuit Judge Edward Hogshire said on Wednesday: 'I think there was overwhelming evidence to support the conviction.' Huguely is scheduled to be sentenced on August 30 on the two charges, which could send him to prison for 26 years. Attorneys for Huguely cited what they argued were pretrial and trial errors in arguing for a new trial. Hogshire, who presided at Huguely's trial, said he found no reversible errors. Huguely, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, killed Miss Love after a day of golf and drinking, incensed that she had had a relationship with a North Carolina lacrosse player. Denied: The judge in Charlottesville said today that there was 'overwhelming' evidence that the 22-year-old had killed his on-off again girlfriend . He kicked a hole in Love's door to get in her bedroom and left her to die, according to trial testimony. The young woman's right eye was bashed in and she was hit with such power that her brain was bruised. She also had wrenching head injury that caused bleeding at the base of her brain stem. A coroner concluded she died of blunt force trauma. Defense and prosecution experts offered different medical opinions on the lethal consequences of her injuries. Huguely's attorneys said he only went to Love's apartment to talk before the encounter quickly turned physical. He said she banged her head against the wall of her bedroom, and she only had a bloody nose when he left. During Huguely's trial, jurors heard testimony from lacrosse players who told of his escalating drinking problem and public spats between the two. Close bond: Yeardley Love (left), at the beach with her sister Lexie, was murdered in 2010 just before she was due to graduate from college . Stolen life: Yeardley Love, 22, (left)  and her boyfriend George Huguely (right) who murdered her at the University of Virginia in May 2010 . Those included Huguely putting Miss Love in a chokehold while on his bed, and one time when she accused him of flirting with two high school girls. Friends and fellow players said the two were unfaithful to each other and had a fiery relationship. In a police interrogation video viewed by jurors, Huguely said he simply wanted to discuss their sputtering, two-year relationship. Huguely admitted he may have shaken her but insisted he didn't grab her neck or punch her. Members of the Huguely and Love families attended the hearing and refused to comment as they left the courtroom. Opposing attorneys also declined to talk to reporters. Huguely, who was dressed in a black-and-gray jail jumpsuit and restrained at the wrists and legs during the hearing, appeared to have piled on weight since his trial, during which he appeared gaunt compared to his playing days at university. He had also let his hair grow over his ears. He occasionally glanced at his family, offering a meek smile. Clutching at straws: Huguely's defense team Francis McQ. Lawrence, left, and Rhonda Quagliana, right, had each of their attempts for a new trial thrown out by a judge today . Huguely's attorneys Rhonda Quagliana and Francis McQ. Lawrence argued motions relating to jury selection, questioning and Quagliana's brief illness during the trial, which they said should have warranted a continuance until she could return to court. 'We were co-counsels in this case,' Ms Quagliana told the judge. 'He has a right to be represented by the counsel he chooses.' Hogshire 'strenuously' objected to the suggestion he rejected a defense bid to continue the trial until Quagliana was fully recovered. On another defense motion - the sequestration of jurors - Hogshire said: 'How do you sequester a jury in the 21st century? How do you do that?' The judge also rejected defense arguments that a juror with long University of Virginia affiliation should have not sat on the jury, arguing he would never be able to pick jurors in this college town. Miss Love's death had a statewide impact, leading to legislation that made it easier for possible abuse victims to get a restraining order in Virginia. The General Assembly passed a law that expands criteria under which people can seek protective orders. The young woman's family has filed two wrongful death lawsuits seeking almost $60 million. The suits name the state, University of Virgina and Huguely's former coaches.","University of Virginia lacrosse player found guilty in February of beating to death ex-girlfriend Yeardley Love .

A music student, who was born without his right hand, has made history by becoming the first one-handed pianist to graduate from the 130-year-old Royal College of Music. As a child Nicholas McCarthy, 23, was refused an audition and told he would never succeed but went on to stubbornly defy the odds and the pessimists to reach the milestone today. The pianist from Tadworth in Surrey is also part of The British Paraorchestra, the country’s first disabled orchestra, which played to welcome Paralympic athletes to London. Scroll down for video . Defied the pessimists: Refused a piano audition as a child, Nicholas McCarthy, 23, has graduated from the Royal College of Music today, the first one-handed pianist to do so in the college's 130-year history . After he was refused an audition at a school for young pianists as a teenager, Mr McCarthy became more determined. He said: ‘It was soul crushing because that’s all I wanted to do - I could feel it would be an uphill struggle, but it made me more determined, I’m quite a stubborn character.’ He taught himself to play on a cheap, electric keyboard from Argos and did not start piano lessons until he was 14. Mr McCarthy said: ‘I had never experienced anything that came so naturally. I found I could play a one-note melody accurately with my little arm - although anything with big chords was out of the question. I practised for hours and hours. Time just disappeared. ‘I vaguely knew how to read the notes from my compulsory music lessons at school, but I played a lot by ear at first: Beethoven sonatas, pieces by Mozart. ‘One day I had the volume quite loud and Dad called up: “Turn off the stereo, Nick”, and I said: “It’s not the stereo. It’s me on the keyboard.” There was silence from downstairs. My parents obviously realised something was happening. Self-taught: Playing the piano came 'so naturally' and after teaching himself on a cheap keyboard, he started piano lessons when he was 14 . ‘It was then that I asked them for piano lessons… Mum and Dad never denied me an opportunity.’ The pianist had planned to become a chef but on hearing a piano sonata by Beethoven he was left ‘dumbfounded’ and changed his career path. He said: ‘I just fell in love with it and decided that was what I wanted to do. I started playing around with the piano and found it came very naturally.’ When he was 17-years-old he secured a place at the junior department of London’s Guildhall School of Music and Drama, winning the annual piano prize. He then went on to the prestigious Royal College of Music in London. Professor Vanessa Latarche, the head of keyboard at the college, said he had been ‘incredibly enterprising’ in overcoming big challenges such as developing the stamina to present a 50-minute recital with one arm. She said: ‘He has been a great inspiration to many of his fellow students in showing what it is possible to achieve with a disability.’ He plays music written specifically for the left hand including works by Austrian composer Paul Wittgenstein who lost his right arm in the First World War. Mr McCarthy said: ‘There is a lifetime’s worth of work available. There are more challenges than for a two-handed pianist because you have to cover the whole piano. ‘It does sound like there are two hands playing.’ Various other well-known composers such as Ravel, Prokofiev and Bartok have written pieces for just the left hand which Mr McCarthy plays at performances. He believes much of his audience is drawn in by curiosity. He said: ‘For many, the first reaction is astonishment, that wow factor. I’ve had some people who thought I’d played with a backing track, but it is just me and my left hand.’ When he first joined The British Paraorchestra, some of the sight-impaired musicians were unconvinced that Mr McCarthy could play with only one hand. He said: ‘When I first joined the orchestra, a couple of the musicians who are partially sighted and blind didn’t believe I was playing with one hand, that was a big compliment to me. Welcomed Paralympians: Mr McCarthy is part of The British Paraorchestra, the country¿s first disabled orchestra, which played to welcome Paralympic athletes as they arrive in London . ‘The music is all written for the left . hand alone, I’m not changing anything, I’m playing the music as it was . written. ‘It’s written very cleverly but you’ve got to be very quick and . good with the pedalling to sustain the bass notes while playing the top . notes.’ His determination has allowed him to turn an apparent disadvantage into an advantage, learning to ride a bike and drive a car. Mr McCarthy said: ‘There are people in my position having counselling, and I just think: “Please get over it and make something of yourself!” Last week he performed in Malta at the country’s prime ministerial offices and on September 13 he will headline his first evening concert at Fairfield Halls in Croydon. Father Ray, a 46-year-old salesman, always let his son do things that other said he could not do. He said: ‘You can do two things when you have a disabled child. You either wrap them in cotton wool and pretend the world isn’t there or you make them do anything and everything. ‘Nick stumbled across the piano. As a parent you think, “he has only got one hand, but what the hell”.’ Now watch the video of Nicholas McCarthy playing .","Nicholas McCarthy was born without his right hand .

With an estimated fortune of $250million, one would think Mitt Romney would not have let a family debt go unpaid for 130 years. An author claims the Republican presidential candidate owes her family $25,000 after her great-grandfather paid Romney's great-grandfather's bail in the 1880s. Instead of showing up at court, Miles Park Romney -- whom one newspaper editor called a 'mass of putrid pus' -- jumped bail and fled to Mexico, leaving his friend liable for the considerable sum. Performer: Miles Park Romney, Mitt's great-grandfather, was known for his theatrical performances. He's pictured here in costume . Author and essayist Judith Freeman traces the debt back four generations to a time when her ancestor, William Flake, and Romney's ancestor were Mormon pioneers together in Arizona. Freeman documents the bizarre family history in the Los Angeles Review of Books, reporting that Flake paid $1,000 to bail Romney out of jail when he was arrested for polygamy. Freeman estimates that sum, not accounting for interested, is worth $25,000 now and that Mitt Romney is liable for it. The story is half tongue-and-cheek and half history lesson on the Romney family's roots in the Mormon church and its participation in polygamy. It began in the 1870s, when Brigham Young -- the founder of the Mormon colony in Salt Lake City, Utah -- tasked Miles Park Romney and William Flake with spreading Mormonism to Arizona. Slings and arrows: Mitt Romney is not the only one who has drawn insults for his public persona. His great-grandfather Miles Park Romney was called a 'mass of putrid pus' by a editor newspaper editor . Before they could embark on their quest, though, Freeman writes, he commanded both men to participate in the 'Divine Principle' and take multiple wives. Flake married Prudence Kartchner, a 16-year-old family friend who became Freeman's great-grandmother. In Utah, Miles Park Romney was known for his role in amateur theatrical productions. Flake had a reputation for his handling of horses and his skills as a frontiersman. Once they moved to Arizona, Romney's reputation seemed to slide.The residents of the dusty frontier towns were deeply suspicious of the Mormons and especially seemed to dislike Romney. One newspaper editor referred to him as 'a mass of putrid pus and rotten goose pimples; a skunk, with the face of a baboon, the character of a louse, the breath of a buzzard and the record of a perjurer and common drunkard.' Prison: William Flake served six months in jail for polygamy after he was arrested by angry Arizonans . Ties: Author Judith Freeman revealed her family's history with the Romneys. Her great-grandfather, William Flake, offered $1,000 bail money for Miles Romney in the 1880s . By the 1880s, Arizona territorial officials began rounding up polygamists after a new law was passed. Both Flake and Romney were thrown in jail. Freeman claims Romney had no money and could not afford the $1,000 bail -- a large sum in those days -- so Flake paid to have both of them freed. Romney repaid the kindness by fleeing to Mexico with his family, including Mitt Romney's grandfather Gaskell Romney. He started an enclave in Chihuahua where Mitt's father George Romney was born. Flake stood trial in Arizona and spent six months in jail. Freeman claims Flake was never repaid. Adjusted for inflation -- but not counting interest -- the sum is now $25,000. 'I want to assure Mitt that I’m more than happy to be the disperser of the funds and I guarantee that all the Flakes of the world will get their fair share the moment he does the right thing,' she writes.","Author Judith Freeman claims her great-grandfather William Flake bailed Mitt Romney's great-grandfather out of jail for $1,000 .

Royal team: Prince Charles in his role as Colonel in Chief of the Army Air Corps with his son Harry who flies Apache helicopters . It was Rupert Murdoch who ordered Sun executives to publish pictures of naked Prince Harry, it  was claimed today. He reportedly did it against the wishes of the Royal Family because he wanted to send a warning shot to Lord Justice Leveson, the man leading the inquiry into press standards in the wake of the phone hacking scandal.

But Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt today said the Sun was not acting in the public interest when it published the photographs and 'personally' he could not see a justification for printing the images. But he insisted that newspaper editors had to be free to make decisions on such issues.

'Anymore of this and he will be grounded. These are big destructive machines. You need an ice cool brain and have to know how to behave.' Harry is likely to be sent to Afghanistan as planned for a second tour, but Army chiefs are reviewing his career after the Prince was pictured naked with a girl at a party with women in his suite. The group played a stripping game and someone in the party is thought to have captured the images of the naked prince on a camera phone.

Call it the palace of high school football: A gleaming $60 million facility with seats for 18,000 roaring fans, a 38-foot-wide high-definition video screen, corporate sponsors and a towering upper deck. Welcome to the new home of Eagles Football. A Palace: the wealthy Dallas suburb of Allen has constructed a new $60 million high school football facility that has seats for 18,000 fans, a 38-foot-wide high-definition video screen, corporate sponsors and a towering upper deck . As school districts across the country struggle to retain teachers, replace outdated textbooks and keep class sizes from ballooning, the wealthy, burgeoning Dallas suburb of Allen is preparing to christen its new stadium with a sold-out Friday night match-up against defending state champions Southlake Carroll. It's not the biggest high school stadium in football-mad Texas, but Eagle Stadium is the grandest, with a spacious weight room for the players and practice areas for Allen High School's wrestling and golf teams. The school district decided to build it in a down economy, knowing full well it will never recoup the costs. All the Bells and Whistles: Eagle Stadium has a spacious weight room for the players and practice areas for Allen High School's wrestling and golf teams. It's a decision that local officials and team supporters defend, saying the stadium will serve as a community centerpiece and source of pride for years to come and will more than pay the costs of operating it. 'There will be kids that come through here that will be able to play on a field that only a few people will ever get the chance to play in,' said Wes Bishop, the father of a junior linebacker on the team and head of the local booster club. 'There will be kids that come through . here that will be able to play on a field that only a few people will . ever get the chance to play in.' For longtime Allen fans, it's a giant step forward from a facility that district spokesman Tim Carroll called 'inadequate in almost every way.' The old building opened in 1976, when Allen had fewer than 8,000 residents, with 7,000 permanent seats, one concession stand and one set of bathrooms. As the town grew to its current population of 87,000, the school had to add portable toilets and rent temporary bleachers, which added 7,000 seats at a cost of $250,000 a year, Carroll said. Today, the high school has 4,000 students enrolled and a 700-member band that's among the biggest in the country. Practice: Football coach Jeff Fleener tosses a football to players during practice at the new $60 million football stadium at Allen High School Tuesday . Collin County, which includes Allen and other Dallas suburbs, is one of the wealthiest areas of Texas - and home to some of the state's top football teams. About 63 per cent of voters supported a $119 million bond package in 2009. Construction on the stadium began a year later. District officials went with more expensive concrete seating over all-aluminum benches, adding perhaps $4 million more to the cost, according to officials. But they said they expected this stadium to last decades. 'Our intention is not to recoup the money it cost to build the stadium,' Carroll said. 'It's not practical to say we'll get that money back. (But) the revenue we receive from the stadium will far exceed the cost of operating it.' While the district did not have estimates, Carroll said he expects the stadium to be competitive in hosting high school playoff games and other events. The school has also sold six sponsorships for about $35,000 a year, he said. Big Match-Up: The scoreboard is shown at the new $60 million football stadium at Allen High School. Allen will christen its new stadium with a sold-out Friday night match-up against defending state champions Southlake Carroll . The new stadium revives an old argument in Texas about whether communities and their schools have their priorities straight. In 1982, when the West Texas city of Odessa built a 19,000-seat stadium for a then-unheard-of $5.6 million, it drew scorn from some people who questioned the district's priorities. Odessa would be featured a few years later in the book  Friday Night Lights, a national best-seller that inspired a movie and a TV series. Indoor Practice Field: Students walk across the indoor practice field that is part of the new $60 million football stadium at Allen High School . Ross Perot, the billionaire businessman and former presidential candidate, repeatedly took aim at his home state's football culture as he pushed the state to shed extracurricular activities and increase accountability measures. 'Do we want our kids to win on Friday night on the football field or do we want them to win all through their lives?' Perot said in a 1988 Washington Post column. 'That's what we have to start asking ourselves.' 'Do we want our kids to win on Friday . night on the football field or do we want them to win all through their . lives? That's what we . have to start asking ourselves.' Today, neighboring Plano High School's stadium seats more than 14,000 people. Mesquite, about 30 miles away from Allen, has a 20,000-seat stadium. And the Berry Center, a suburban Houston facility with a stadium, an arena and theater, opened in 2006 and cost about $84 million. 'In a couple of years, someone's going to do something that's bigger and bigger,' said Robert McSpadden, who runs the high school football site TexasBob.com. Officials in Allen reject the premise that they're focusing on sports over academics. The bonds approved three years ago also funded a new performing arts center, and Carroll said extra revenue from stadium operations will go into the district general fund. Allen's student test scores are also largely stellar. Students walk across the indoor practice field that is part of the new $60 million football stadium at Allen High School . But for now, Eagle Stadium is gaining wide notoriety. The No. 8-ranked Eagles' Friday game against Southlake Carroll, which won a state championship last year and is ranked No. 1 in The Associated Press' Class 5A preseason poll this season, sold out in just over a day. More than 2,000 people are expected to watch from standing-room areas. Bishop's son Zack, a linebacker, said he and his teammates already noticed differences: a more spacious weight room, a softer playing field. 'It's going to be really incredible to step out in front of a full house and a sold-out game.' 'It's going to be really incredible to step out in front of a full house and a sold-out game,' he said. Chris Wallace, whose oldest son is a senior quarterback, said she had to reassure him when they visited smaller colleges over the summer with older facilities. 'In his mind, this is it,' she said. 'He can't even believe it's here already.' And there's always room for growth. Fred Montes, one of the architects of what he called ""an incredible project,"" said the district's master plan left open the possibility for more construction, if needed. 'The end zone that has seats currently can be expanded,' he said. 'And on the visitors' side, you can always put a deck.'

It's a crucial question in the Lord Lucan saga that has remained  unanswered for nearly 40 years: What caused the murderous rage that led him to kill the family nanny, batter his pretty young wife and then flee, never to return? Now dramatic new evidence can be revealed that throws fresh light on what may have driven Lucan   into such a violent fury before he killed Sandra Rivett with a lead  pipe and left Lady Lucan with serious head wounds. It comes in a remarkable testimony from former croupier Barri Hitchin, who claims to be one of the last people to have seen Lucan before he vanished, and who has finally broken his silence on the tragic events of November 7, 1974. Croupier Barri Hitchin tells how peer gambled away equivalent of £50K in an hour . Mr Hitchin said he watched in astonishment that night at the  Ladbroke Club in Mayfair as so-called Lucky Lucan, a notorious gambler, lost £8,000  – roughly equivalent to £50,000 today – in just over an hour playing blackjack, before exploding with rage and attempting to overturn the card table. The game started at 7.40pm and Lucan left in a fury at 8.50pm – ten minutes before detectives believe  29-year-old Mrs Rivett was killed at Lucan’s Belgravia home, an eight-minute drive away. Mr Hitchin added: ‘When the papers came out with the story of the nanny’s murder, I did wonder whether it was us that tipped him over the edge.’ Mr Hitchin, 61, who now lives in the West Country, had been working at the Ladbroke Club after qualifying as a croupier and was making ends meet while he saved up for  acting school. He recalled how he first set eyes on Lucan, wearing full evening dress, at 7.40pm on the night of the murder. He said: ‘I am very sure of his arrival time because I had just begun my 7.30pm break. I was ten minutes into it when I was asked to come down and set up a private blackjack table. Lucan came to the table with four £1,000 blue plaques which I would exchange for £25 chips as and when he required. 7th Earl of Lucan with fiancee Veronica Duncan on the announcement of their engagement in 1963 . Lucan's African watering hole? Cresta Botsalo Hotel in Palapye, where two engineers believe they saw Lucan . ‘I took that £4,000 off him pretty quickly, maybe 30 to 35 minutes.’ Mr Hitchin remembered Lucan going to the cash desk and returning with another £4,000. ‘This time, I took the money off him even quicker – inside 25 minutes. At the end, he was down to his last £25 chip. ‘He looked at me, waiting for the deal. I politely reminded him of the terms of the game – minimum two hands; minimum £25 stake on each. His face went white, he became extremely aggressive and he barked at me, “Listen boy, when I tell you to deal, you deal.” I dealt the hand and Lord Lucan lost again. ‘In that moment, he exploded with rage. He clenched his fists and brought them down with a huge bang on the table. His face was contorted; he was absolutely furious. ‘My entire year’s salary was £4,000 and he had lost twice that inside an hour. He tried to tip the blackjack table over and David [a casino supervisor] and I threw ourselves on top of it to stop him.  He stormed out and that was the last we saw of him.’ Mr Hitchin said he never told his story at the time out of a sense of loyalty to his employers at the casino, and also because he feared his account would never be believed in the face of what he insists was an Establishment cover-up. He eventually gave a statement to a Metropolitan Police officer by telephone earlier this year, following claims that Lucan was living secretly in Africa. Bad loser: Notorious gambler Lord Lucan with fellow card players at a London club . After the nanny was killed and Lady Lucan attacked, Lucan fled in a Ford Corsair borrowed from one of his gambling friends. It was found abandoned at Newhaven on the  Sussex coast. There were bloodstains on the front seat and a length of lead piping, wrapped in bandages, in the boot. It matched a similar weapon found at the murder scene. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police would not discuss Mr  Hitchin’s statement but added: ‘The inquiry has never been closed. Any significant new information will  be considered.’ The Ladbroke Club enjoyed a short but chequered history. In 1979, it was mired in scandal over how it lured well-heeled new customers.  Profits soared after the club paid a network of private eyes to note the number plates of expensive cars arriving at rival casinos and a corrupt policeman was allegedly paid to supply the owners’ addresses. They were then targeted with flowers and champagne, and hostesses would call them with offers of free dinners. Licensing magistrates closed the place down. The Hill Street building is now offices but lies empty pending refurbishment.","Croupier says he watched 'Lucky Lucan' lose thousands at the Ladbroke Club in Mayfair in just over an hour .

Iran could strike U.S. bases in the Middle East in response to any Israeli strike on its nuclear facilities, the leader of Lebanon's Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah said on Monday. 'A decision has been taken to respond and the response will be very great,' Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in an interview with the Beirut-based Al Mayadeen television. 'The response will not be just inside the Israeli entity - American bases in the whole region could be Iranian targets,' he said, citing information he said was from Iranian officials. 'If Israel targets Iran, America bears responsibility.' Warning: Iran could strike U.S. bases in the Middle East in response to any Israeli strike on its nuclear facilities, Lebanon's Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah warned today (file photo from Aug 17) But Nasrallah said there were divisions in Israel over attacking Iran's nuclear facilities, which the West says could be part of a nuclear weapons program - a charge which Tehran denies. 'Personally I do not expect the Israeli enemy - at least in the coming months or foreseeable future - (to wage) an attack on the Islamic Republic of Iran,' he said. Iran has previously claimed to have the capability to carry out these threats against U.S. bases. On July 4, Iran declared that it could destroy nearby U.S. military bases and strike Israel with minutes of an attack on their country. General Ami Ali Hajizadeh of Iran's Revolutionary Guards said in July that U.S. bases are in range of Iran's missiles and could be targeted in retaliatory strikes. He also said that the Guards had successfully tested anti-ship missiles that could sink U.S. warships in the Gulf. The missile has a range of 300 kilometres, he said. The US Navy's 5th Fleet is based in Bahrain, an island in the Gulf about 200 kilometres from Iran, well within range of Iranian missiles. Nasrallah's announcement came after Israeli’s biggest-selling newspaper today claimed that America has secretly negotiated with Iran to keep the U.S. out of a future Israel-Iran war. Washington has approached Tehran through two unidentified European countries, the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper said. The paper said the United States told Iran it expected Tehran in return to refrain from retaliating against U.S. interests, including its military in the Gulf. The report did not disclose any source for its information. Deal made? Israeli¿s biggest-selling newspaper says America has secretly negotiated with Iran to keep the U.S. out of a future Israel-Iran war; Iran's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, left, is welcomed by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Tehran last week . An Israeli official, who asked not to be identified, described the report as illogical. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the Israeli newspaper story, which appeared during the Labor Day holiday. President Barack Obama is fighting accusations from his Republican challenger Mitt Romney that he is lax in support for Israel, Washington’s long-term ally in the Middle East. The Obama administration says it is strongly committed to Israel’s security and to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Sunday: 'I can tell you that there is absolutely no daylight between the United States and Israel when it comes to the necessity of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.' An Israeli official said: 'It doesn’t make sense. There would be no need to make such a promise to the Iranians because they realise the last thing they need is to attack U.S. targets and draw massive U.S. bombing raids.' The United States and Israel both accuse Iran of developing nuclear capability that could be used to make a weapon, and have both said they reserve the right to take military action to prevent Iran from making a bomb. Obama's assurance: Israel¿s Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor said he still believed Obama¿s assurances that Washington was prepared to use force if needed to prevent Iran from developing a bomb . However, the Obama administration has repeatedly made clear in public that it thinks diplomacy and tough new sanctions have not yet run their course, even as Israeli officials say the window for effective military action is rapidly closing. And General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was quoted in Britain’s Guardian newspaper as saying of a prospective Israeli attack on Iran: 'I don’t want to be complicit if they choose to do it.' Israel’s Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor said he still believed Obama’s assurances that Washington was prepared to use force if needed to prevent Iran from developing a bomb. 'I don’t know what kind of messages Yedioth Ahronoth heard,' Meridor said. 'But I think the Iranians understand ... that if they cross a line towards a bomb, they could encounter very strong resistance, including all the options that are on the table - as the American president has said.' Drawing the line: On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the time had come for world powers to declare a 'clear red line' for Iran's nuclear activities . Yedioth Ahronoth is a mainstream newspaper, not known for taking a particular political line on U.S.-Israeli ties. Iran denies it is seeking a weapon and has threatened to retaliate fiercely against both the United States and Israel if either attacks it. Setting what is expected to be the main talking point for his coming U.S. visit, Netanyahu said on Sunday the time had come for world powers to declare a 'clear red line' - which he did not define - for Iran’s nuclear activities. The West had failed so far to convince Tehran it was truly determined to halt Iran’s nuclear activity, Netanyahu said, in remarks widely portrayed in Israel as a critique of Obama.","Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said that the response to any Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities would be 'very great'

Defeated: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he hoped plans for House of Lords reform would be revived in the next parliament . Nick Clegg said today he hoped his plans to reform the House of Lords can be revived in the next parliament as he formally confirmed the proposals had been abandoned by the current Government. The Deputy Prime Minister has led calls for a mainly-elected second chamber, but was forced to concede defeat last month when faced with entrenched opposition from Tory MPs and Labour's refusal to back a crucial timetable for the House of Lords Reform Bill. As MPs returned to Westminster following the summer recess, Mr Clegg confirmed the Bill had been withdrawn but said he hoped the process had 'inched us forward' towards his goal of a reformed Lords - a flagship Liberal Democrat policy. Speaking in the House of Commons, he allowed himself a rueful smile as he told MPs: 'I would like to make a statement on House of Lords reform... or what’s left of it.' The formal announcement that the Bill had been killed off was greeted with cheers by Tory backbenchers sat behind the Deputy Prime Minister. 'I can confirm that the Government has today withdrawn that Bill, about which I am not as happy as members behind me are,' Mr Clegg said. He continued: 'Regrettably the coalition will not be able to deliver Lords reform during this Parliament.' But Mr Clegg said that the 'hard work' of MPs and peers on the proposals had 'inched us forward'. The legislation was given a second reading by MPs earlier this year, as Labour backed the principle of the reforms. But . the Bill's progress was halted as Labour sided with Tory rebels in . refusing to back a timetable necessary to prevent it being talked out. Scroll down to see Clegg face the Commons . Little progress: Mr Clegg confirmed the Bill had been withdrawn but said he hoped the process had 'inched us forward' towards his goal of a reformed Lords . Prime . Minister David Cameron failed to reach an agreement with his backbench . rebels over the reforms and Mr Clegg was forced to concede defeat. Mr . Clegg condemned Labour’s actions, but told the Commons: 'My hope is . that we will return to this in the next parliament, emboldened by the . historic second reading vote. 'For . now, the immediate decision for the Government is how we fill the gap . in the legislative timetable and we will bring forward measures to . promote growth.' Deputy . Labour leader Harriet Harman said she shared Mr Clegg’s 'disappointment . at the lack of progress' in reforming the upper chamber. Status quo: Legislation to reform the House of Lords received a second reading earlier this year, but Mr Clegg was forced to admit defeat for his proposals last month . 'It can’t be right that in the 21st century we have an unelected chamber making decisions on the law of the land,' she added. The fallout from Mr Clegg's humiliating defeat has widened cracks in the coalition Government. When . the Deputy Prime Minister announced the end of the proposals last . month, he claimed that the Tories had broken the coalition 'contract'. He . revealed that, in retaliation, Liberal Democrat MPs could no longer . support changes to constituency boundaries for the 2015 general . election. Pressure point: David Cameron leaves 10 Downing Street today. Cracks in his coalition Government have widened after Tory rebels failed to support proposals for reform of the House of Lords . David Cameron denied the contract had been broken, and said he intends to press ahead with the boundary changes, which would reduce the size of the House of Commons from 650 to 600 seats. It is thought the changes could deliver as many as 20 extra seats to the Tories, by equalising the size of constituencies across the UK. Sympathy: Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman said she shared Mr Clegg's 'disappointment at the lack of progress' in reforming the upper chamber . Ms Harman asked Mr Clegg whether the process of boundary changes would now be stopped in its tracks as a result of Lib Dem opposition. 'Isn’t it pointless and costly to allow the Boundary Commission to carry on with its work for a further 14 months?' She asked for an early opportunity for MPs to vote on the issue, promising Labour support for Mr Clegg. Ms Harman asked: 'Will you turn your words of August 6 into action? The ball is in your court, will you assure the House that at least we have a Deputy Prime Minister who is a man not a mouse.' But Mr Clegg attacked Labour, who he blamed for the Lords legislation’s failure, giving Ms Harman '10 out of 10 for spectacular insincerity'. 'The Labour Party used to campaign against privilege and patronage,' he said. 'The Labour Party used to say it was the party of the people. 'The Labour Party used to believe that the second chamber should be abolished altogether. 'And yet when push comes to shove what did they do?' The Deputy Prime Minister continued: 'They voted for the idea of reform but not for the means to deliver it. 'They delivered lofty speeches about the need to give the people a say about how to elect the legislators in the other place, but they wouldn’t even tell us how many days they wanted for the timetable motion to make that lofty rhetoric a reality. 'I think the history books will judge the Labour Party very, very unkindly indeed.' Mr Clegg said that, faced with the opportunity to build on the work of former ministers Robin Cook and Jack Straw and be the 'friends of reform', Labour instead 'turned into miserable little party point-scoring politicians instead'.","Deputy Prime Minister formally confirms his proposals to reform upper chamber have been abandoned by the Government .

Though trains have wavered in and out of fashion over the past few decades, a bold plan seeks to relieve train traffic on the ever-crowed Northeast Corridor by building a new route –under the Long Island Sound. Bullet trains would race between Boston and Washington and pass under the Atlantic Ocean estuary in an 18-mile underwater tunnel. But the construction would not come cheaply, at an estimated $151billion. Scroll down for video . Expansion: Amtrak is looking into expanding on the Northeast Corridor, adding to its Acela fleet . Fast times: In a design by students at the University of Pennsylvania, new high speed tracks - seen in red - would be added to pre-existing routes on the Northeast Corridor . Tunnel vision: The new route, in red, shows a proposed 18-mile stretch of track going under the Long Island Sound and into Connecticut . In a plan proposed by design students from the University of Pennsylvania in conjunction with Robert Yaro of the Regional Plan Association, students mapped out a design that would connect major cities along the Eastern Seaboard – including Washington, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston – with a high-speed bullet train. Students estimated the entire construction would cost around $100billion, with $20billion dedicated to the new segment connecting New York City and Hartford, Connecticut. Similarly, Amtrak’s plan, which was released in July, is for a $151billion expansion. In either proposal, finances are a major concern. The rail company would need significant public and private funding to get the project on track. Speaking with the New York Times this summer, Amtrak president and CEO Joseph H. Boardman said: ‘We can worry about where the money is coming from, but we need to have a plan in place so when it does, we’re ready.’ The students write in their proposition, entitled ‘Making High-Speed Rail Work the Northeast Megaregion,’ that the new high-speed rail tracks could cut existing travel times in half, making a commute between New York and Washington only one hour and 45 minutes. Current route: Amtrak's Acela service passes from Washington to New York in less than three hours, but with the proposed route, that time would be just over an hour . A commute between New York City and Boston would be a little over three hours. As the Hartford Courant notes, the proposed plans has ‘at least a bit of bipartisan appeal,’ mentioning that faster train service along the Northeast Corridor would allow hundreds of thousands of passengers to travel more quickly and cheaply from city to city. In fact, by 2040, ridership is expected to reach a staggering 43.5million annual riders. Many high-speed rail propositions made by President Obama and Vice President Biden have been touted by conservatives in Congress that the plan was too costly. Members of the GOP said in 2011 after they turned down the president’s $8billion bill that the busy Northeast Corridor was where the future of high-speed trains lay. Last year alone, Amtrak transported 11million passengers along the corridor. Commuter network: More and more people along the Eastern Seaboard are relying on fast trains; here, travellers are seen in Philadelphia's 30th Street Station . Big plans: Amtrak plans a $7billion expansion of D.C.'s Union Station, pictured, with the goal of making it a high-speed rail and commercial hub . Train spotting: People walk in front of the Amtrak departure board at New York's Penn Station; train service from Washington to New York would be cut in half by the new bullet trains . The feat to build an 18-mile tunnel under the Long Island Sound, while certainly an ambitious undertaking, does not make it the longest underwater tunnel. That title belongs to the Channel Tunnel, which runs 31.4 miles under the English Channel. Likewise, the Seikan Tunnel in Japan, which runs 33.5 miles, with a 14.5-mile segment under the sea bed, holds the record for the longest stretch of underground tunnel. The Federal Railroad Administration has launched an intensive study on the corridor, examining the current route from Washington, D.C. to Boston. Included in its study are the metropolitan regions around Washington, Baltimore, Wilmington, Philadelphia, New York, New Haven, Providence, and Boston. The bullet trains, much like those in Europe and Asia, could skyrocket across tracks at speeds up to 220mph.

Employees at a Sainsbury store in Altrincham organised a whip-round when they learned the grandson of one of their colleagues had been maimed in action.

Deli counter worker Patricia Harrison, . the grandmother of the injured soldier, told the jury: 'I had to keep . going to Alison Potts and ask when she was going to give me the . collection money. She did say, ‘I’ve got to count it.' Mrs Harrison told the court she repeatedly tackled the 49-year-old boss in the staff canteen. She said: 'I didn’t like to ask, ‘Have . you got the money?’ I did say ‘I believe there’s a collection’ and she . said ‘I’ve got to count it’. ' 'She used to say ‘I’ll see you tomorrow’ or ‘I’ll see you next week’.' Asked how often she had asked about the collection, Mrs Harrison replied: 'It was quite a few times.'

Love-struck: Elizabeth Robinson was allowed to meet with the object of her affection, 12-year-old Dylan, after reuniting with her parents . A lovesick 13-year-old Texas girl was found safe and sound after traveling hundreds of miles to visit a boy she has been talking with over an Internet game, and on Friday the two were allowed to finally meet face to face. Elizabeth Annette Robinson, of Cypress, Texas, was tracked to Nashville, Tennessee, where a trooper stopped the teen Thursday after he noticed that the car she was driving matched the description included in an Amber Alert which had been issued for her. Harris County Sheriff’s deputies said Robinson was released to her parents Friday morning in Nashville, according to the Houston Chronicle. The 13-year-old was reported missing Thursday after her mother said she had sneaked out of her bedroom the night before. Robinson . decided to run away after getting into an argument with her parents . over a 12-year-old boy from Kentucky she had met on the Internet through . the Xbox video game Call of Duty. ‘She . started staying in her bedroom more, isolating herself where she was . always with the headset, always talking. That’s how they communicated . through the Xbox,’ Tressa Robinson told KHOU. Elizabeth’s father took away the Xbox console earlier this week, and that is when the girl apparently hatched a plan to take off on her quest. Robinson’s mother said she had been asking questions about the brother’s car and what kind of gas mileage it gets. Runaway: Robinson, 13, was found safe after driving hundreds of miles away from home to meet with a boy she has been communicating with online . Family feud: Elizabeth decided to run away after her father took away her Xbox to stop her from chatting with her 12-year-old friend . The girl, whom her mother, Tressa Robinson, described as naive and sheltered, fled in her brother's 2011 brown Nissan Versa and with her mother’s debit card, and was believed to be headed to Hodgenville, Kentucky, to meet up with her young friend, Dylan. While years away from being able to . obtain a learner's permit to operate a vehicle, Robinson managed to . drive more than 790 miles before she was stopped outside of Nashville, . Deputy Thomas Gilliland, spokesman for the Harris County Sheriff's . Office, said. 'It's amazing she was able to manipulate the roadways,' Gilliland said. Worried: Although her mother, Tressa, described Elizabeth as naive, the girl managed to operate a vehicle, navigate highways and use her debit card before she was stopped in Tennessee . The 13-year-old fled her home at around 9:30pm Wednesday night. The following morning, her parents discovered that she had escaped, leaving a note behind saying that she was running away to a girlfriend’s house because of bullies at school, and threatening to kill herself. But after going through her email messages, Elizabeth’s parents figured out that their daughter was actually heading to Kentucky to meet with her Xbox boyfriend. Dylan stayed at home in Kentucky. He apparently said over the phone that he tried to dissuade the 13-year-old from running away. Authorities began tracking Elizabeth’s travels through her mother’s debit card. She used it on Thursday in Henderson, Texas. According to WSMV, Trooper Dwayne Stanford received an alert that the runaway teen had been seen in Hope, Arkansas, at around 2pm Thursday. He calculated that she would be headed his way about 10pm or 11 pm. Around her expected arrival time, the officer pulled into a median and decided to wait.As Stanford predicted, Elizabeth drove by him on Interstate 40 outside of Nashville around 10.24pm. He immediately activated his emergency lights to pull her over. After crashing into a guard rail, the teen was taken into custody and her parents were notified to pick her up. Once . her father arrived, however, the family decided it would be best to let . her complete her journey and finally meet Dylan. He drove her the rest . of the way to Kentucky visit the boy.

This is definitely not the beach you want to throw your towel down on…as it's covered with hundreds of thousands of migrating Hermit crabs. Every year on the tiny isle of St John in the U.S. Virgin Islands a bizarre phenomenon occurs when hundreds of thousands of Hermit crabs, also known as Soldier crabs, make the treacherous journey towards the sea.They all travel en-mass at the same time to reach the water where they breed. The female crabs then cast their fertilised eggs into the Caribbean before retreating back into the vegetation. On the march: Millions of hermit crabs - also known as soldier crabs - head for the shoreline on the tiny U.S. Virgin Island of St John . The newly born Hermit crabs spend several months in the sea before returning to the land.Hermit crabs are predominantly a land creature, often burrowing into the roots of large trees, but must stay relatively close to the sea as they require a supply of water in their shells. The sea is also a perfect breeding ground for the crabs, who release millions of offspring into the waters. Photographer and cinematographer Steve Simonsen, 53, from Michigan in the U.S., captured the spectacle with his camera at Nanny Point in the south east of the island after a tip-off from a friend. He said: 'I received an urgent telephone call from my good friend Pam Gaffin. 'She was terribly excited about an event that was happening before her eyes. She told me it was a migration of soldier crabs also called hermit crabs and there were millions and millions of them, she likened it to the migrations of Serengeti.''I didn't need to hear anymore, I loaded my car with cameras and was out the door.' he said. Crustacean army: The rocky shoreline is carpeted with the hermit crabs, which travel to the water en masse to breed once a year . Mating season: The hermit crabs breed in the water, and the female crabs cast their fertilised eggs into the sea before retreating . Incredibly, the entire crab migration takes just one day, with the crabs heading down to the seafront at sunrise, laying their eggs before retreating back up inland into the hills at noon. 'When I first arrived at the beach, the sight of that many crabs was astonishing,' Mr Simonsen said. 'It was hard to fathom and once I set up a camera for a wide shot, I had to try to settle myself down and be sure that I would get all the shots that I needed.''Picking my way through the mass of crabs was difficult and time consuming. I would pick a spot on the beach rocks, close to the action that I wanted to film and I would crouch, kneel or lay down in order to get the shots. 'During that time, crabs would crawl over my feet, hands, arms and legs and none of them were interested in pinching.'The photographer plans to study the crabs' incredible migratory patterns next year when the phenomenon takes place again in August.

Charged: Lori Hamilton, 42, is accused of repeatedly locking a four-year-old boy inside a filthy, bug-infested cupboard . A Florida woman was arrested and charged with child abuse for allegedly locking a four-year-old boy inside a filthy kitchen cupboard for hours on end on multiple occasions. Lori Hamilton, 42, was taken into custody on Thursday and is being held without bail in Polk County Jail. According to authorities, Hamilton repeatedly locked the child inside the compartment and screwed it shut to prevent the four-year-old from escaping, Orlando Sentinel reported. Witnesses described the cabinet and the residence as a whole as dirty and roach-infested, adding that the four-year-old was forced to urinate and defecate on himself while in captivity. Hamilton admitted to keeping the boy in the cabinet where she stores pots and pans, but said that it only happened four times and for about 20 minutes at a time. The woman told deputies she did it because the boy would often keep her up at night. She also said the boy only soiled himself once, News 13 reported. It remains unclear what is Hamilton's relationship to the four-year-old. The home where the child was being kept does not match the woman's listed home address, according to MyFox Tampa Bay. According to the suspect's arrest . report, the child would often be trapped inside the cupboard until . someone else in the house found him and let him out.

But when the 42-year-old woman realized the boy had been sprung free, she would often haul him back into his makeshift holding pan despite his pleas to be set free, the document stated. The little boy told investigators that he was often bitten by cockroaches and spiders, and confirmed that he would use the cupboard as a bathroom when locked inside for extended periods of time. Department of Children and Families spokeswoman Carrie Hoeppner said three children were placed into protective custody because of the environmental hazards in the home and the accusations that Hamilton locked her son in the cabinet.","Lori Hamilton, 42, charged with felony child abuse .

A mother has been sentenced to 10 years in prison over the disappearance of her 18-month-old son. Zinah Jennings still refuses to tell police where her son Amir, who was last seen 10 months ago, is now - though she insists the boy is safe. The 23-year-old showed no emotion on Friday as the verdict of unlawful conduct was read at a courtroom in Columbia, South Carolina. Missing: Zinah Jennings, left, has refused to tell police where her son Amir, right, is - but she says he is safe . A jury of eight women and four men deliberated for two and a half hours before reaching its decision, and a judge sentenced Jennings to the maximum 10-year sentence. The defendant had been held without bail ever since her arrest. The last time Amir was seen was November, when a security video at a Columbia bank recorded them both. Police say Jennings repeatedly lied to them about where the boy is, telling false tales that led them to search places from Atlanta to Charlotte. Jennings, who did not testify in her defence, has said she left the boy somewhere safe but would not give details when questioned by police. Prosecutors played a lengthy police interview in which Jennings cried as she said her son was safe but that she could not prove to detectives that the boy was alive. Convicted: A jury in Columbia, South Carolina found Jennings guilty of unlawful conduct over the disappearance . Sentenced: Jennings, pictured being led away from court on Friday, will spend 10 years in prison . Investigators have found Amir's blood on baby blankets retrieved from Jennings' car, but no other trace of him. Some of the dozens of prosecution witnesses testified during the two-week trial that Jennings - who gave birth to a second child last week - said she was overwhelmed by the stresses of parenting an active, energetic boy and needed a break. One friend said Jennings told her she pondered selling or giving away Amir, and even mentioned throwing the boy out the window of a moving car. Other prosecution witnesses testified that they saw Jennings kick Amir when he misbehaved or squeeze his hand when he wouldn't say 'mama'. Employees at the bank where the video came from testified that Amir was often not in a car seat when his mother pulled up at a drive-through window. Defence: The boy's grandmother Jocelyn Jennings Nelson told the court her daughter must be innocent . Jennings' mother, however, said that, while she and her strong-willed daughter butted heads when it came to parenting styles, she does not believe her daughter would ever have harmed Amir. Before sentencing, Jocelyn Jennings Nelson also said she thought her daughter had suffered from post-partum depression and that she tried to find counseling for her after Amir's birth. 'She didn't understand what her body was going through and the impact motherhood was having on her,' Mrs Nelson told the judge. 'At this point, Amir could be anywhere... I will never stop looking for him.' It was unclear who would care for Jennings' baby girl, though her mother has said she would be willing to do that. Judge Knox McMahon said that Jennings would get all necessary medical care. In pronouncing sentence, Mr McMahon made it clear that his thoughts were with the boy. 'I also do not know where Amir Jennings is,' the judge said. 'I know where his blanket is. I know where his blood is. 'There's one innocent person, one blameless person, one person that cannot fend for himself in the world we live in, and that's Amir Jennings.' Mr McMahon also recommended that Jennings receive counseling and ruled that she be credited with the nine months she has already served in jail.","Amir Jennings disappeared in November 2011, aged 18 months .

Boston University has been left reeling following the release of an explosive report detailing allegations of gross sexual misconduct by the hockey team which comes just a month after a former player pleaded guilty to assaulting a woman. Corey Trivino, a second-round draft pick by the New York Islanders who played four seasons at BU and was their top scorer, drunkenly tried to force himself on a woman in her dorm room on campus in 2011, the Boston Globe said. Rape charges against a second player, Max Nicastro, were filed but later dropped when prosecutors said they could not meet the burden of proof. Hockey star: Corey Trivino who played four seasons at Boston University pleaded guilty to an assault charge in August for allegedly trying to force himself on a woman . Nicastro signed an entry-level . contract with the Detroit Red Wings shortly thereafter and has been . assigned to play for Grand Rapids in the American Hockey League. On August 7, Trivino, 22, was . sentenced to two years of probation during which he must be tested . randomly for alcohol use, attend weekly Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, . receive a mental health evaluation, and have no contact with the victim. Harrowing night: A police report detailed how the drunken Trivino had repeatedly tried to kiss and fondle a female resident assistant on campus in December of 2011 . The incident involving the former . star hockey player happened on December 11, 2011, when Trivino . confronted the victim, who was a resident assistant in the BU dorm, when . she tried to enforce quiet time on her floor, the Globe  reported. Suffolk Assistant District Attorney . Gloriann Moroney said that when the 23-year-old woman went to the noisy . room, a drunken Trivino answered the door. According to Moroney and a . Boston University police report filed in court, Trivino then followed . the woman back to her residence. The 190-pound, six-foot-one hockey . player then repeatedly tried to force himself on the woman, and at one . point lay down on her bed and proclaimed he was going to sleep there. When the victim told Trivino to go . back to his room, the player ‘started kissing her...and groping her . breast area,’ police said in the report. The woman ordered Trivino to . stop and leave. Trivino complied, but then returned . moments later, pushed the door open and again tried to kiss the . 23-year-old, but she managed to shove him away, according to the police . report. The victim told Trivino that ‘you . need to stop’ and ‘you need to go,’ police wrote. But the young man . instead cornered her by the desk and continued to kiss her even as she . pushed him away from her and out the door. But the player returned once again, . pushed his way into the room, tried to kiss the woman and then declared . that he will spend the night in the woman’s bed, after which he took . off his shoes and lay down, police said. Punishment: In August, Trivino was sentenced to two years of probation during which he must be tested randomly for alcohol use and attend weekly Alcoholics Anonymous meetings . The woman contacted a school official . who told her to call BU police. At that point, Trivino left the dorm . room and was picked up by officers who came to investigative the . disturbance. In the wake of his arrest, Trivino was removed from the BU hockey team. During a hearing in August, the . victim said in her impact statement that the incident ‘has affected every . ounce’ of her being. On his part, Trivino responded by apologizing for . his behavior that night. Trivino's name was back in the spotlight this week following the release of a shocking report that exposed the sexual antics of university hockey stars at a controversial championship party. The scandal exploded after Boston University released a report on the 'culture of sexual entitlement' by its hockey team. Troubling: Lurid details have emerged of the sexual antics of Boston University hockey players at a controversial championship party - which includes students having sex in the penalty box . Many of the details of the . investigation - which includes tales of sexual debauchery - were only . revealed in confidential subcommittee reports. However, . these documents - which have been reported by the Boston Globe - paint a . worrying picture of the attitude of some of the university's hockey . players towards sex. The report contained details of a late-night championship party in 2009 at the Agganis Arena which revealed that: . Details of the party have now only emerged after a task force was launched in February when two Boston University hockey players were charged with sexual assault. The investigation by the task force found that some hockey players - when surrounded by fans - had 'the perception that they need not seek consent for sexual contact.' One player told investigators: 'You don’t ask [permission for sex] when you are drunk.' Wild: The report contained details of a late-night championship party in 2009 at the Agganis Arena, pictured here for basketball, which revealed that party-goers took to the ice naked to shoot ice pucks . The task force was told by one female . student that a hockey player had put his hands down her pants at a . party and, despite the fact that she was punching him, refused to stop. When asked why she had not reported the incident to authorities, she replied: 'that’s just what [BU hockey players] do.' The reports also found that some hockey players at the university boast about their sexual exploits on Facebook, often referring to conquests as 'kills'. Many of the hockey players, the investigation found, regularly engage in group sex. The university campus police and administrators did not find out about the controversial 2009 party until this year once the task force investigation started. Party goers were having sex in the penalty box, drank from beer kegs in the locker room showers and took to the ice naked to shoot ice pucks. Players also put on Facebook their female conquests . It has emerged that during interviews with investigators hockey coach Jack Parker said at first that he did not know about the party. However, he later acknowledged that he knew some of the men had been drinking in the locker room. Despite this, two players and a member of staff said that within a few days of the party, the coach had reprimanded the team for its behaviour. The subcommittee report also found that some of the hockey players are less academically gifted than the vast majority of their classmates. One professor described how six hockey players intimidated their classmates and answered their mobile phones during lectures. Eventually, all six of the players dropped out of the class. However, another professor said hockey players were respectful and prepared. Following a recommendation by the task force, Parker has been stripped of the title of executive athletic director. He still keeps another title. However, he will still continue as coach and will earn the same salary. The public report has made 14 recommendations, which the university intends to implement.","Corey Trivino, 22, was sentenced to two years probation in August .

A pet owner starved her two dogs so badly that one was forced to eat part of his mother’s dead body in a desperate attempt to survive. The mother died a ‘horrendous’ death and both were in a terrible state when found after two weeks of starvation earlier this year at the home of Katrina Plumridge, 31, in Grimsby, Lincolnshire. The barely-alive dog was ‘shockingly thin’ and the house had a ‘nauseating and overpowering’ stench, Grimsby Magistrates Court heard. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Horrendous: The male dog, Scrappy (right), was so badly emaciated that he ate the body of his mother Ronnie (centre) to try to survive at the home of Katrina Plumridge in Grimsby, Lincolnshire . The suffering was so serious that the female Staffordshire bull terrier, named Ronnie, died of starvation, Nigel Burn, prosecuting, told the court last Friday. Suspended jail term: The dogs were in a terrible state when found after two weeks of starvation at the home of Katrina Plumridge, 31 (pictured) The male dog, her son Scrappy, was so badly emaciated that he ate her body to try to survive. ‘The degree of suffering caused to both dogs was extreme and prolonged,’ Mr Burn said. ‘It was as severe and extreme as it can get.’ The alarm was raised when a letting agent visited her home and saw dog mess on the steps, stairs, an upstairs floor and a bed. A painfully thin dog jumped past him. He said its ribs, spine and hip bones could all be seen and it was the thinnest dog he had ever witnessed. He tried to go into the kitchen but it . was blocked from the inside by the dead body of the mother dog. The . letting agent then called the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Mr Burn said: ‘Every single bone in its frame was visible and the stomach was curved in. The empty dog bowls were bone dry.’ A . decorator who went into the house said the stench made him feel . physically sick, Ronnie was like a skeleton and Scrappy was ‘shockingly . thin’. A veterinary surgeon estimated that the dogs would have been suffering from starvation for at least two weeks. Plumridge moved out of the house on March 28 but the dogs weren’t found until April 19. She had claimed a friend was supposed to be finding new homes for the dogs and left them without going back to check on them. But the RSPCA treated this with scepticism because she couldn’t give a full name or a telephone number for her friend. She even claimed that she could not leave bowls of food or water for the dogs because decorating was going on. Plumridge admitted they were ‘horrendous’ offences and led to ‘very sad circumstances’, Ed Bates, defending, said. He . added: ‘Plumridge claimed that the dogs were looked after OK but she . admitted that no bowls were left for them ""because decorating was going . on"". ‘Concern had been raised by visitors because the dogs seemed to be hungry - but these dogs were always hungry and would eat anything that was put down. Astonishing neglect: The barely-alive dog Scrappy (pictured) was 'shockingly thin' and the house had a 'nauseating and overpowering' stench, Grimsby Magistrates Court heard . ‘One of the dogs had pinched some of the decorator’s sandwiches but they always acted that way and it was not because they were not being fed properly.’ 'Concern had been raised by visitors because the dogs seemed to be hungry - but these dogs were always hungry and would eat anything that was put down' Ed Bates, defending . Unemployed Plumridge was handed an 18-week suspended prison sentence, 180 hours’ unpaid work and was ordered to pay £500 costs. Magistrate Tony Miller told her: ‘You should have continued to check on them to ensure there were in safe keeping.’ Plumridge was banned from owning, keeping or being involved with the care of animals until further notice under the Animal Welfare Act. She will have to serve a minimum ban of one year before applying to a court to have the ban lifted.","Neglect by Katrina Plumridge saw Staffordshire bull terrier Ronnie die .

A businessman suspected of gunning down an officer who visited his home trying to help him was found dead on Monday evening after a day-long standoff with police. A search team entered Ricky Coley's home in an affluent Detroit suburb around 6pm and found his body inside, according to a police spokesman. Officers had been surrounding the house of the 50-year-old former auto executive since Sunday night, when officer Patrick O'Rourke was shot to death while responding to a report of a possible suicide attempt. Coley was having legal and financial problems in his business and was recently divorced. Killer: Ricky Coley, left, apparently shot officer Patrick O'Rourke, right, when police visited his home in Detroit . Siege: Police brought at least two armored vehicle to Coley's house in an affluent suburb on Monday . Mr O'Rourke, 39, was one of four or five officers who responded to the call on Sunday. He was killed when shots were fired through a bedroom door and wall. Authorities found Coley's body about an hour after sending in demolition equipment to tear open the house. It was not immediately clear how he died. At least two armored vehicles were brought to the upscale neighbourhood in West Bloomfield Township, which was evacuated after Mr O'Rourke was gunned down. Police in the Oakland County community sent a team around 10 pm on Sunday after getting a 911 call saying that Coley had tried to kill himself or needed medical attention, police spokesman Tim Diamond said. Officers called Coley's name as they climbed the stairs to the second floor and were met by shots. Officers: Police besieged the home all day, only to find Coley dead when they finally made it inside . Coley was alone in the house on Monday afternoon. Volleys of gunfire were heard hours earlier, but it was unclear who fired them. Officers closed roads in the area and evacuated at least 10 families from their homes. Before authorities sent in the big machine, Mr Diamond said the sheriff's department was 'trying to persuade this guy into a peaceful resolution.' Court document show that last week Coley's wife was granted a divorce and sole custody of the couple's seven-year-old son, following allegations he cheated on her and attacked her. Coley headed a private equity firm, CNC Holdings. Standoff: Several residents were evacuated from the area while police staked out Coley's home . The U.S. Labor Department recently filed a lawsuit accusing him of mishandling money that was supposed to cover employee insurance at a trucking company, Translogic Auto Carriers, which has been controlled by CNC since 2008. The lawsuit says Coley also transferred $342,000 from Translogic to himself or his affiliates. Creditors forced Translogic into bankruptcy court in 2010. Mr Diamond said relatives called 911 and fled Coley's home on Sunday after hearing shots. He said the stress of Coley's divorce and financial problems were probably factors. Mr O'Rourke, a West Bloomfield officer for 12 years, was married to his high-school sweetheart Amy and had four children. The policeman's father told WXYZ he was experiencing 'a rollercoaster of emotions' as he paid tribute to a son who was 'as strong as three men'.","Ricky Coley apparently shot dead officer Patrick O'Rourke on Sunday night .

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:13 EST, 11 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:28 EST, 11 September 2012 . Convicted: Calvin Harris, seen here in a 2005 court appearance, was charged with the murder of his estranged wife but her body was never found . A once-prominent auto dealer from upstate New York is urging the state's top court to overturn his conviction for murdering his missing wife whose body has never been found. Calvin Harris, 51, said that circumstantial evidence and trial errors lead to his murder sentence after his estranged wife Michelle, who disappeared on the morning after the September 11th terrorist attacks. His defense attorney William Easton agrees, arguing on principal that motive and intent, without a body, are not enough in this case. There's no body, no murder weapon, and two possibilities about when she was last seen alive. Co-workers said that they last saw Michelle leaving her shift as a waitress on the night of September 11, 2001, but a farmer came forward as a witness years later saying he had seen a woman resembling Michele and a younger man arguing at about 5.30am on September 12, 2001. The district attorney Gerald Keene argues that in addition to small splotches of blood found in the divorcing family’s kitchen, there was also a threat overheard by the victim's hairdresser. Now, New York's Court of Appeals will decide whether Calvin L. Harris was fairly convicted of murdering the mother of his four children or presumed guilty based on insufficient circumstantial evidence. The seven judges on the state's top court heard oral arguments Tuesday and a ruling is expected next month. Tense: At the time of Michelle's (right) disappearance, she and Calvin (left, seen in 2009) were still living together with their four children but there had been talk of divorce . Two truths undisputed by both prosecutors and defense are that she hasn't been seen since September 2001 and no murder weapon was ever found. 'The logical inferences to be drawn don't prove beyond reasonable doubt that Harris murdered his wife,' defense attorney William Easton said. He said there's no viable theory for how Harris could have killed her at the house where they both still resided with their children, then disposed of her body within the supposed time frame, less than eight hours, and the limited geography. Timeline: Initially Michelle's waitressing co-workers said they last saw her on the night of September 11 but a farmer came forward years later saying he saw her arguing with a younger man early the next morning . Harris called the baby sitter about 7am the next morning, saying his wife hadn't come home and he needed help getting the kids ready for the day. Harris, now 51, is in Auburn prison, eligible for parole in 2034. He was co-owner of several upstate car dealerships and involved in a fractious divorce. His net worth was estimated at about $4million, which prosecutors saw as motive. They also pointed to evidence of threats. Tioga County District Attorney Gerald Keene said he finally decided to prosecute Harris in 2005, no longer hoping investigators would find a body or that Harris would make an admission to someone. 'I thought the evidence was a very good, strong circumstantial case. There was good evidence of motive and opportunity and really good blood evidence,' he said. Mr Keene argued that some small blood spatters in the kitchen entryway and garage floor supported his theory that Harris hit his wife with a blunt object, imperfectly cleaned up, and buried her somewhere in the isolated area with thousands of acres of woods and trees. The defense argued there was no telling how long her blood had been there and there was very little of it. Harris' first conviction in 2007 was vacated after a new witness suddenly turned up, a farmer who said he had seen a woman resembling Michele Harris and a younger man arguing at about 5.30am on September 12, 2001. Her vehicle had been found parked at the end of their driveway. Harris was convicted again in 2009, leading to the appeal. Gone: Investigators gave up looking for the mother-of-four's body because the family's house is in 'the middle of nowhere' surrounded by thousands of acres of woods . 'Case law used to be until like 1980, you did have to have a body in order to have a murder prosecution and a valid murder conviction,' Mr Keene said. That changed in later convictions that were upheld with no body, weapon or confession, including a New York physician whose wife vanished after he flew a rented plane out over the Atlantic Ocean and came back, he said. Mr Easton filed an appeal citing legal insufficiency of evidence against Harris, and that the trial court made errors including refusing to exclude a juror who admitted having an advance opinion on guilt. Prior to the case being brought to the state supreme court, a midlevel court split 3-1 in affirming the conviction.","Calvin Harris found guilty of killing his wife Michelle but her body and a murder weapon were never found .

A homewares shop that has not changed since it opened in 1895 has closed down after being beaten by ‘the modern age’. The Period House Shop in Warwick, Warwickshire has incredibly survived through six different monarchs, two World Wars and rationing only to be forced to close its doors because of the recession and the popularity of internet shopping. The shop has traded six days a week since it opened but on October 18 it will shut its doors for the last time. Closing after 115 years: Shop manager Charlie Collett blames 'the modern age' for forcing him to close The Period House Shop which opened in 1895 . Still with original shop bell, the old-worldly shop has sold polish, door knockers, old-fashioned lights and tradition ceiling roses from a Grade II listed building that dates back to the 1840s. Staff still wear the same brown leather waistcoat uniforms as the original staff. Charlie Collett, 50, who has managed the shop for 20 years, blamed the ‘modern age’ for the shop’s closure. Original: The shop has not changed since it opened and staff still wear the original uniforms. The shop is located far right in this picture from the 1910s . To close its doors: The shop will close for the last time on October 18 after trading six days a week . He said: ‘While our stock is made in the company’s own brass foundry or fashioned by our blacksmith, most of the shop fittings haven’t changed since 1895. ‘We are closing because it seems to us all the shopping happens in nearby Leamington and the council keeps digging up the roads. ‘Sadly the modern age has finally caught up with us and we can no longer compete with modern shopping methods.’ No change: The shop's stock comes from the company's own brass foundry and most of the shop's fittings have not changed since 1895 . Astonishing history: The old-worldly shop sells various homewares but Mr . Collett says 'we can no longer compete with modern shopping methods' Old-worldy: Stock is fashioned by the company's blacksmith in what Mr Collett said was the 'best preserved Victorian shop' he has ever seen . Mr Collett bought the Victorian shop after the previous owner tried to modernise the business. He said: ‘I fell in love with the shop the moment I saw it. ‘Some people say this place looks a bit like that shop used in the Two Ronnies’ television sketch where Ronnie Barker is trying to buy four candles. ‘The old owner came to me and offered to sell me the fittings as they wanted to turn it into a modern shop. ‘When I arrived there I just said “you cannot do this” it was the best preserved Victorian shop I have ever seen. ‘I didn’t do any market research, I just said I’ll take the lease and leave it just the way it is there and then. Town in decline: Blaming the recession for the shop's bad business, Mr Collett said the town of Warwick has struggled since nearby . Leamington became a spa town, making it a more popular destination . But Mr Collett said the town of Warwick had struggled for a very long time. ‘In recent years the Warwick business has dwindled and we are now only taking about a third of what we need to take. ‘Warwick has been in decline since the 1820s to be honest, ever since Leamington became a spa town and it became more fashionable to shop there. ‘It kills me to shut down the Warwick shop, but I just cannot keep it open any longer.’ The three storey building was first opened for business as an iron mongers in 1840. There are various businesses in the UK which have an astonishingly long history including butcher's shop RJ Balson and Sons in Bridport, Dorset which opened in 1535.

The Internal Revenue Service has today awarded a jailed tax cheat whistleblower and former UBS AG bank employee Bradley Birkenfeld $104 million for handing over insider information into the Swiss bank's promotion of secret offshore accounts to U.S. taxpayers. Lawyers for the Boston-born banker said that they believed that the sum is the largest reward ever handed to one whistleblower in the U.S. and the IRS confirmed that amount had been given to Mr. Birkenfeld, but refused to say whether it was the largest award to date. The money was awarded to Mr. Birkenfeld after he told U.S. authorities about illicit banking practices that were encouraged by the Swiss banking giant that led to UBS paying $780 million in fines and agreeing to hand over information on more than 4,000 Swiss bank account holders to avoid a criminal case. Scroll Down for Video . $104 million man: Bradley Birkenfeld talks to the press before surrendering to authorities at the Schuylkill County Federal Correctional Institution in Minersville, Pennsylvania in January 2010 . The 47-year-old former banker wasn't at the press conference held by his attorney's. He has only been recently released after serving part of a 40-month sentence after pleading guilty to withholding information about his own role in the Swiss bank scheme, specifically his relationship with a California property developer. Mr. Birkenfeld took advantage of a 2006 law passed by Congress that awards whistleblowers up to 30 percent of the revenue they help to recover with the information that they supply to the IRS. Bradley Birkenfeld makes remarks before surrendering to authorities at the Schuylkill County Federal Correctional Institution in Minersville, Pennsylvania before his prison sentence began in 2010 from which he has just been released . The 2006 law sponsored by Republican Senator, Charles Grassley targets high-income tax dodgers, guaranteeing rewards for qualified whistleblowers if the company in question owes at least $2 million in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties. The $104 million that has been handed to Mr. Birkenfeld is taxable experts said to the Wall Street Journal and speculated that the attorney's fees could range from 15 percent to 35 percent of the pretax award. 'The IRS today sent 104 million messages to whistleblowers around the world — that there is now a safe and secure way to report tax fraud and that the IRS is now paying awards,' Birkenfeld's lawyers, Stephen M. Kohn and Dean A. Zerbe, said in a statement. 'The IRS also sent 104 million messages to banks around the world — stop enabling tax cheats or you will get caught.' The IRS, which doesn't usually confirm individual award payments, said Birkenfeld signed a disclosure waiver, allowing the agency to confirm his award. 'The IRS believes that the whistleblower statute provides a valuable tool to combat tax non-compliance, and this award reflects our commitment to the law,' IRS spokeswoman Michele Eldridge said in an email. Birkenfeld has become something of a cause-celebre among whistleblowers because of the magnitude of his case and the fact that he was jailed after cooperating with authorities. Former UBS employee Bradley Birkenfeld in an undated photograph. The Internal Revenue Service has awarded the ex-banker $104 million for providing information about overseas tax cheats . In a summary of the award provided by Birkenfeld's lawyers, the IRS said, 'The comprehensive information provided by the whistleblower was exceptional in both its breadth and depth.' 'While the IRS was aware of tax compliance issues related to secret bank accounts in Switzerland and elsewhere, the information provided by the whistleblower formed the basis for unprecedented actions against UBS AG, with collateral impact on other enforcement activities and a continuing impact on future compliance by UBS AG,' the IRS said in the summary. Federal prosecutors, however, had said Birkenfeld withheld information about his own dealings with a former UBS client who pleaded guilty in 2007 to tax charges. In a case that shook Swiss banking to its core, UBS in 2009 entered into a deferred prosecution agreement and paid $780 million in fines, penalties, interest and restitution to settle charges that it helped 17,000 U.S. clients hide $20 billion. U.S. authorities are still investigating other Swiss banks. As the U.S. government struggles with a massive budget deficit, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley said as a result of the information provided by Birkenfeld, 'billions of dollars in taxes owed will be collected that otherwise would not have been paid.' A typical Swiss bank account is traditionally one of the most secretive options for storing money and of avoiding tax . Grassley has in the past criticized the IRS whistleblower program, which gathers information from people who want to alert the tax-collecting agency to misconduct. Grassley, a Republican, wrote a bill in 2006 that overhauled the program. Last year, the whistleblower program collected only $48 million in tax revenues, down from $464 million in fiscal 2010. New whistleblower cases were down, as well, with some lawyers complaining that the program office was slow and uncooperative with whistleblowers. Grassley said the case showed the whistleblower program can be effective, but he criticized the IRS for taking nearly four years to settle with Birkenfeld. 'If the IRS is serious about encouraging future whistleblowers, it needs to continue to honor the spirit and intent of the law and issue awards in a timely manner.' In 2009 UBS entered into a deferred prosecution agreement and paid $780 million in fines, penalties, interest and restitution to settle charges that it helped 17,000 U.S. clients hide $20 billion.

Meier after he was sentenced to 40 months in prison by the judge on August 21, 2009 - three years before benefiting from the 2006 law sponsored by U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (right) The sum paid by the IRS to Birkenfeld is 'the largest whistleblower reward issued to a single individual,' said Stephen Kohn, one of the former banker's lawyers. Dean Zerbe, another Birkenfeld attorney, said his client's actions have brought in $5 billion in taxes from 'big banks and wealthy individuals who tried to evade paying their fair share.' The U.S. crackdown on Americans dodging taxes in Switzerland has spawned a diplomatic showdown between the two countries. In 2010, UBS agreed to disclose 4,450 American client names. Eleven Swiss banks are known still to be under investigation by the United States and the Swiss have been seeking a legal deal to remove the taint from their financial industry. The Birkenfeld case could prompt a backlash from the financial industry and its U.S. allies, said Solomon Wisenberg, a partner at law firm Barnes & Thornburg. 'The response could be for the friends of big business in Congress to argue this is an outrage that someone involved in this could get this kind of award,' he said. 'But if ever there was anyone who deserved a big reward it was this guy. He's done something no one's ever done before, essentially brought the Swiss banks to their knees,' said Wisenberg.

A father was sprayed in the face with a powerful chemical by police who arrested him for staging a sit-in protest at a supermarket about a faulty television set. Officers squirted pava spray into Eric Rawlinson's eyes and struck him on both arms with a baton before removing him from the Tesco Extra store in handcuffs while staff and shoppers watched. Mr Rawlinson, 41, had been protesting peacefully for four hours at the Swindon supermarket because staff told him they would not exchange his 10-month-old television, which had a faulty on-off switch. Arrest: Peaceful protester Eric Rawlinson was squirted in the eyes, struck on both arms and handcuffed as officers removed him from a Tesco Extra store in Swindon . But his demonstration ended dramatically after the store's manager called police. Officers arrived to find the unemployed former design manager sitting on a swing chair in the corner of the electrical goods area. After Mr Rawlinson told them he could not move, they squirted his eyes with the noxious spray - more potent than CS gas - and then struck his arms to release his grip from the chair. He was handcuffed face down on the floor. Then two other police vans and two squad cars arrived. Pava spray canisters, which are used by about 60 per cent of police forces in England and Wales, contain pelargonic acid vanillylamide and ethanol. They are designed to minimise a suspect's ability to resist arrest without unnecessarily prolonging their discomfort. Mr Rawlinson, a father-of-two from Abbey Meads, Swindon, described the encounter as 'the giants against the little people'.

Police forcibly removed Rawlinson from the Tesco Extra store by using a pava incapacitant spray on his eyes and striking him with a baton on both his arms . 'I was given an offer for a repair service but under my consumer rights I rejected it because I wanted an exchange,' he told the Swindon Advertiser. 'Too many people would go quietly and accept it but I believe I have a right of exchange.' Mr Rawlinson said that staff were 'polite' but refused to back down over the £599 widescreen set.

Mr Rawlinson, a father-of-two from Abbey Meads, Swindon, described the encounter as 'the giants against the little people' PAVA spray is an incapacitant spray dispensed from a hand-held canister in a liquid stream propelled by nitrogen. It is approved for police use in the UK, although many forces use the significantly less potent CS gas spray instead. The liquid stream is a spray pattern and has a maximum effective range of up to 4 metres. Maximum accuracy, however, will be achieved over a distance of 1.25 to 2 metres. PAVA primarily affects the eyes, causing closure and severe pain. The pain to the eyes is reported to be greater than that caused by CS. The effectiveness rate is very high once PAVA gets into the eyes; however, there have been occasions where PAVA and CS have failed to work - especially when the subject is under the influence of alcohol or drugs . Exposure to fresh moving air will normally result in a significant recovery from the effects of PAVA within 15 to 35 minutes. Both PAVA and CS are prohibited under s5 of the Firearms Act as a 'weapon of whatever description designed or adapted for the discharge of any noxious liquid, gas or other thing'. While it is unlawful for a member of the public to possess them, police officers, as servants of the Crown, are exempt from this restriction. Store manager Stuart Edginton said he was forced to call Wiltshire Police because Mr Rawlinson ignored repeated requests to leave and warnings from staff. Mr Edginton called Tesco head office numerous times during the stand-off but he was advised to stick to the company's policy, which only offers a refund or exchange during the first 28 days after purchase. A Tesco spokeswoman said: 'It is our policy to return a faulty item to the manufacturer for repairs and if these cannot be done, we will happily offer an exchange or refund. 'In this instance, as a gesture of goodwill, we also offered the customer an extended warranty on the product and the loan of another television. 'Unfortunately, the customer was not satisfied, and the police were called when he refused to leave the store after several hours.' A spokesman for Wiltshire Police . said: 'When officers arrived at the supermarket, the male was asked to . leave the store, but refused to do so. 'Despite . officers best efforts to resolve the situation, the male refused to . leave the store so was arrested for breach of the peace but resisted . officers when they tried to arrest him. 'In trying to restrain the male, officers were required to use pava spray and an asp (police baton). 'The . first officers arrived at the scene approximately 10 minutes after the . call but when the man became aggressive, officers called for emergency . assistance and a further four units were called as precaution.' Mr Rawlinson was seen by a police doctor but did not require any medical treatment. He was cautioned for obstructing an officer in course of their duty before being released.","Officers squirted pava spray into Eric Rawlinson's eyes after he refused to leave the supermarket in Swindon .

"By . Laura Powell . PUBLISHED: . 21:38 EST, 15 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:38 EST, 15 September 2012 . Man with a pram: Michael Kenny, at Norland College where he was the first male student, with his 'reality baby' Michael Kenny makes for an unlikely Mary Poppins. The 18-year-old is a keen second-row rugby player, his cooking repertoire extends only to boiling some pasta and heating a jar of sauce, and he can’t even sew a cushion. He also admits, without the faintest trace of irony, that until recently ‘I didn’t think such things as nannies existed. I thought they were just in children’s books and films’. In fact, his only hint of domestic prowess is washing his own dirty socks. ‘I have a washing machine and it’s not hard to use,’ says Michael in his very first interview. But Michael has just become the first man to study for a degree at the prestigious Norland College in its 120-year history. At the end of his four-year course, he will join the ranks of the supernanny elite, some of whom have gone on to care for the children of royals, pop stars and the super-rich in Miami, Geneva and Los Angeles, commanding salaries up to £50,000. Despite spending the next four years in an all-female environment, there’s nothing in the slightest bit girly about Michael. Yes, he will be having a stab at quilt-making and how to change a nappy, but he’s also a down-to-earth sort of man. Michael confesses to being a rather sporty type with a love of the outdoors and has a steady girlfriend who thoroughly approves of his unusual career choice – as does his mother, who inspired him to apply to Norland in the first place. Any jibes about spoons full of sugar and nursery rhymes are taken philosophically. And no, he doesn’t believe it is controversial to employ a man as a nanny – it gives parents a choice,  he explains. ‘Any situation in which my male friends can turn a phrase on me and make people laugh they’ll do it,’ he chuckles. However, his girlfriend, Ellie Hatherwell, an 18-year-old first year history student at York University, is ‘very supportive’. ‘I’d like to think I’ve given her the impression so far that she doesn’t need to worry about me being in a class with48 girls,’ says Michael. He adds: ‘It is intimidating going into Norland for the first time. The gates do paint quite a picture. I was walking in on the first day and as I came down the steps, there was a rippling effect of whispers – and then silence. I did get a few looks. It was daunting. ‘The whispers didn’t last too long, though. I found some girls  I knew and things soon went back to normal.  A lot of the girls ask me how I’m coping with being the only male there. It’s good that they’re so supportive.’ '9am: So many things to remember! No drinking and pramming in public - and never ever leave a baby in a KFC' Raised by Mary, a bookshop owner, and Simon, a civil servant at the Department for International Development, Michael spent his early years moving between Nepal and Uganda with his father’s work. ‘Mrs Penny, my second year teacher in Uganda, is my role model,’ he says. ‘I was at an age where school was the last thing I wanted to do but  she made it more enjoyable. To recreate that would be amazing.’ In 2003, Michael’s family moved to Kazakhstan and to Ethiopia, before returning to Uganda. Michael later attended Kingswood School in Bath, where he took up rugby until a slipped disc hampered his progress in the sport. His sister Alice, 17, and brother John, 12, still attend schools in Uganda. ‘Coming to England was a shock as the only schooling I’d known was in Uganda,’ he admits. ‘In Africa the buildings were all very open,  the weather was lovely and I enjoyed outdoor activities such as  camping.’ Michael took A-levels in theology, philosophy and design technology, but decided on a career working with children after volunteering to teach maths and English to disabled children at the Katalemwa Cheshire Home for Rehabilitation Services in the Ugandan capital, Kampala. '5pm: It's not all work being the only man in a class of 49. We have so much in common: we love children and matching beige uniforms!' ‘A lot of the children had cerebral palsy and many couldn’t speak English, or speak at all in some cases. That pushed me in the direction of working with children,’ he says. ‘I really enjoyed helping them learn how to how to hold pencils and also move objects through different shaped holes.’ However, he balked when his mother first suggested that he should apply to Norland College, which is now based in Bath. ‘I knew about Norland and the idea of it can seem quite intimidating as the college has such a reputation. At the time I didn’t even know if Norland took on male applicants.’ However, after speaking to ‘Norlanders’ who were sub-letting his parents’ house in Bath and looking at their timetables, Michael decided to apply to join the BA (Hons) course in Early Childhood Studies. Norland was the only college he applied to. What attracted him was Norland’s graduate success rate – it has  been reported that the average  Norlander receives 15 job offers upon graduation. ‘Because it was my only option, the interview was even more nerve-racking,’ he recalls. Open-minded celebs: Gwyneth Paltrow, left, and Jemima Khan, right, have had male nannies . ‘I was wondering what the receptionist’s face would look like when I   arrived and said I was there for an interview. There was a slight look of  bemusement, but actually she was very professional.’ Known as the Rolls-Royce of  nannies, Norlanders have been hired by Princess Anne and the Duchess of York, as well as Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall. For a few years, ‘mannies’ became all the rage with Madonna, Elle Macpherson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Britney Spears, Jemima Khan and Keeley Hawes all employing men to care for their children. And yet they remain a rarity and the debate continues over whether ‘mannies’ should bathe, dress and tend to young children. Earlier this month, more than 300 parents joined a fierce debate on the Mumsnet website. The majority were in favour of male nannies but a sizeable number raised objections, which ranged from fears for a child’s safety to a man’s ability to do the job as well as a woman. Despite this, eight out of ten parents say that it is more acceptable now than ten years ago to hire a male nanny, according to a survey conducted in 2009 by Tinies, one of the largest domestic recruitment firms in the UK. Michael has no doubts. ‘Some families could hold the view that women are more inherently nurturing of children.’ Asked how he would try  to allay the fears of reticent families, he replies diplomatically: ‘It’s their choice.’ Though he was determined to work with children, he was initially uncertain about joining Norland, whose female students wear an Edwardian-style uniform of fawn dresses, sensible lace-up shoes, hats and prim white gloves. ‘When my mother first put forward the idea of going to Norland,  I said “No way,” ’ he admits. ‘You walk around Bath and see the uniform and know what it represents. What put me off was the fact that I didn’t think I’d fit in.’ However, after speaking to former students, Michael did a U-turn and sent in his application form. His decision has earned him the nickname Manny among his male friends, many of whom are bemused at his unlikely career choice. After being accepted on the course, he was given his own tailor-made Norlander uniform – a tweed blazer, a fawn tie embroidered with the  ‘N’ logo, a cream shirt and chinos from Gap. Only one other male student has passed through Norland College, but Michael is first to take a degree. In 2005, Peter Cummins, from Dyfed, took a three-year diploma. At the time, Peter said: ‘I don’t see any problem. My careers adviser hinted that it was very female-dominated, but I took no notice. ‘My male friends call me the Manny, but my female friends are very supportive. ‘My father also said it was a great opportunity. Some people would think he was hard on me but there was no problem. Females might already have certain experiences but there’s nothing that Norland can’t teach me.’ The degree course is a mix of classroom lessons and practical experiences. It costs £13,710 a year for the first two years and £4,120 a year for the final two years. Past Norlanders have been taught how to drive on icy roads without skidding, how to sew a rag doll, prepare a home-made chicken curry, and how to massage a child to sleep – a skill likely to be popular with some celebrities. Gwyneth Paltrow recently said that she often massages her six-year-old son Moses  to sleep. Michael says: ‘Being male might help me appeal to a family with more boys than girls. They might want a male role model for their children. ‘I’m not saying that wouldn’t happen with female graduates, but it could be to my advantage.‘Of course, some people might hold the view that it is a female profession and that women are more inherently nurturing of children. ‘It’s their choice, but hopefully there will be people who see it as an equal gender job.’ Posing proudly for photographs with his Edwardian-style Silver Cross pram and his impeccably-behaved reality baby (Norland College forbids it being called a doll), Michael says: ‘Being male and a nanny has never been a concern.  I don’t think that gender should be held against somebody. ‘One week in and already, I feel part of the Norland family.’","Michael Kenny is the first man to study for a degree at Norland College in its 120-year history .

It's been almost a year since Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, 23, bled to death when her full-term fetus was cut from her womb, and her three surviving children in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, don't go a day without asking about her. The children and their father, Christian Mercado, are getting psychiatric help to deal with the horrors, which will be rehashed at the trial that starts on Monday of the woman charged in the killing. Carlos Mercado, and his fiancee, Darla Gutierrez, moved into the apartment below his son's shortly after the October 2011 attack to help care for his son and the children - daughters ages 5 and 7 and a 3-year-old son - who still don't understand what happened. Family support: Carlos Mercado, the father-in-law to slain mother Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, is pictured beside his fiancee Darla Gutierrez outside their Milwaukee home where they have been living beneath his son Christian . Family: Darla Gutierrez holds up a picture of Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, bottom left, around her three children and husband . '""Where's mom? When is she coming home?"" They are too young to comprehend that,' Ms Gutierrez said. Morales-Rodriguez, 34, is accused of faking a pregnancy, panicking as her supposed due date approached and then luring the 23-year-old Ramirez-Cruz to her house. There she attacked her with a baseball bat, choked her and then used an X-Acto knife to cut the fetus out, according to the criminal complaint. According to court documents, Morales-Rodriguez had a couple of miscarriages and her boyfriend wanted a son. Prosecutors say she planned for two weeks to look for a pregnant woman and take her baby. She found Ramirez-Cruz, who was due any day, around a nonprofit organization that provides Hispanics with social services and offered her a ride. Ramirez-Cruz died of blood loss and asphyxiation, and her fetus, a boy, died as a result of her death, authorities say. Charged: The trial against Annette Morales-Rodriguez, 34, accused of killing Maritza Ramirez-Cruz and cutting out her baby in October last year is set to start on Monday . Police say Morales-Rodriguez then hid Ramirez-Cruz's body in her basement. Later that evening, emergency services responded to a . call from Morales-Rodriguez, who said that she had . just given birth to a child who was not breathing, according to the . criminal complaint. Paramedics were unable to revive the boy and he was pronounced dead at the scene. Morales-Rodriguez was taken to the hospital but, . after an autopsy of the full-term baby - and medical examinations of the . woman herself, it was determined that she was not pregnant and had not recently given birth. The next day, police returned to Morales-Rodriguez's home and found Ramirez-Cruz's mutilated body. Morales-Rodriguez is charged with two . counts of intentional homicide, including homicide of an unborn child. A . conviction on either count carries a mandatory life sentence, although a . judge could allow for the possibility of parole. Wisconsin does not . have the death penalty. Tragedy: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz had three children and was expecting her fourth when she was savagely murdered after offered a ride . Victim: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, 23, was expecting her fourth child when she was murdered last October. Her baby boy, who she planned to call Omar, also died . Her . original lawyers had planned to use an insanity defense, but her new . lawyers changed her plea Thursday to not guilty. A court-ordered doctor . didn't find evidence to support the insanity plea. A . judge also ruled last week that an incriminating statement she made to a . detective in an emergency room would be admissible at trial, even . though the detective failed to explain her right to remain silent. He . ruled it admissible under a public welfare or emergency rescue exception . because police didn't know yet that Ramirez-Cruz was dead. Gutierrez and Carlos Mercado said they hope the trial brings peace of mind to the family. 'They are just dragging it on and dragging it on and the family needs closure,' Gutierrez said. Mercado said he will be at his son's side during the trial. Suspect: Annette Morales-Rodriguez, seen left and right, is accused of wanting the baby after faking a pregnancy and her alleged due date approaching. Morales-Rodriguez has pleaded not guilty . 'I have to go with him,' he said, as he wiped away tears. 'It's going to be hard for me and hard for him. I have to help him.' The . trial is expected to last a week, with the state calling 25 to 30 . witnesses. Prosecutor Mark Williams said he plans to play . Morales-Rodriguez's videotaped confession to police. Morales-Rodriguez's . lawyers have declined to discuss the case, and it wasn't known whether . she plans to testify. Mercado and Gutierrez said they don't think they could ever forgive her. 'They . always teach you to forgive but something like this, no,' Gutierrez . said. 'You see everything Maritza had in her in her daughters.' They hope she is convicted and gets life without parole. Crime scene: The house near 7th and Mitchell streets, where Annette Morales-Rodriguez allegedly killed 23-year-old Ramirez-Cruz . 'I want the judge to recognize what she did and give her what she deserves,' Mercado said. Similar . cases of women taking an unborn child from a mother's womb were . reported in Massachusetts and Oregon in 2009, in Pennsylvania in 2007, . in Illinois in 2006 and Missouri in 2004. In the Oregon case, a woman obsessed with having a baby pleaded guilty last year to the murder of a pregnant woman whose unborn child was cut from her abdomen after she was bludgeoned to death. Korena Roberts, 29, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. In Massachusetts, a Worcester woman, Julie Corey, pleaded not guilty to killing her pregnant friend, Darlene Hayes, and cutting the baby from Hayes' womb. Corey and the baby were found in a homeless shelter in Plymouth, N.H., in July 2009, just days after Hayes was found dead with a fractured skull.","Murder trial in the death of Maritza Ramirez-Cruz is set to start on Monday .

Monday's . protests will cap a weekend of Occupy Wall Street seminars, music and . demonstrations in New York, said Linnea Paton, 24, an OWS spokeswoman. Demonstrations are also planned in other U.S. cities, other OWS . organizers said. The . grassroots movement caught the world by surprise last fall with a . spontaneous encampment in lower Manhattan that soon spread to cities . across North America and Europe. Occupy . Wall Street briefly revived a long-dormant spirit of U.S. social . activism, and drew enduring attention to economic injustice. Clash: Another protester is arrested by NYPD officers in the march . Peaceful protest: A police officer gives orders to Occupy Wall Street protesters during the march, though he seems not to listen . Civil disobedience: A protester, who said she was not acting as part of the overall Occupy movement but as an individual, lights an American flag on fire . Let it burn: Another person assisted the woman light the flag . But the movement's colourful cast of theatrical demonstrators struggled through last winter to sustain the momentum that first drew attention to its patchwork of economic grievances - including corporate malfeasance on Wall Street, crippling student debt and aggressive bank foreclosures on American homes. On Sunday, organizers will provide live music, including a Foley Square concert featuring Tom Morello, guitarist for the rock band Rage Against the Machine. At 7am Monday, some protesters will try to surround the NYSE, while others will engage in a loosely choreographed series of 'sit-ins' at intersections throughout the financial district, according to OWS's website. The tactics are designed to undermine New York police efforts to contain protesters on the narrow, winding streets of the financial district.

A Facebook invitation promoting the event tells protestors to arrive onsite wearing business or business casual clothing, explaining: ' This will help us blend in and make the job of the police more time-consuming.' Last year's demonstrations featured the spectacle of activists breaking into sudden dashes down one narrow street or another, pursued by visibly frustrated police and television reporters tripping down cobblestone streets. Sound permits for Sunday's events have been secured, Paton said, but OWS has not sought permits for Monday's protests - which last fall led to mass arrests and clashes between police and protesters. Occupy Wall Street maintains about $50,000 in its bail fund, several organizers said. Chief New York Police Department spokesman Paul Brown confirmed that no OWS demonstration permit applications were submitted, but said police will be prepared for demonstrations. 'We accommodate peaceful protests and make arrests for unlawful activity,' he told Reuters. Brown said that based on previous experience with OWS, the NYPD expects that 'a relatively small group of self-described anarchists will attempt unlawful activity and try to instigate confrontations with police by others while attempting to escape arrest themselves ... we expect most demonstrators to be peaceful.' At the ready: Police stand around after monitoring an Occupy Wall Street march; officials have said they expect most protestors to be peaceful . Not here: A police officer gives orders to Occupy Wall Street protesters as other brothers in blue await commands .

New York police have made a total of 1,852 Occupy arrests as of September 12, 2012, according to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance's office, including the arrest of 700 protesters who spilled into the roadway while marching across the Brooklyn Bridge last October. On Friday, Twitter was ordered by a New York judge to turn over the tweets of one of the protesters arrested on the bridge. That case has emerged as a closely watched court fight over law enforcement access to users' social media content. Six weeks after the Brooklyn Bridge arrests, citing public health concerns, New York authorities entered the Manhattan OWS camp and disbursed protesters. The movement has never regained its initial momentum.","At least 300 people marched from Washington Square Park to Zuccotti Park Saturday ahead of one-year anniversary .

Idyllic: The prestigious school is set in beautiful grounds in the Cotswolds but its students have recently got in lots of trouble . In July two students broke the jaw of a fellow student in a violent attack during a students' night event at a local club. Polo player Adrian Clay, 20, needed surgery on his broken jaw after the beating by fellow Royal Agricultural College students James Guerin and James Fry. The . pair set on him on several separate occasions during a students’ night . at a nightclub near the university - called the Rock Club - because . he bumped into them on the dance floor.

Darren Ford, a member of Cirencester Roundtable, kicked four cars . outside his Whiteland Road home after becoming increasingly frustrated . with his young neighbours from the college. The 37-year-old pleaded guilty to four counts of criminal damage and . using threatening behaviour.

An eminent gay professor has claimed that he was victimised at his university after flagging up pay inequality among his male and female colleagues. Professor Jefferson Frank claimed at an employment tribunal today that he received a lower rating than less experienced and less published co-workers, despite founding the department and serving as its head. The American-born financial expert, who is openly gay, also fears he is being mistreated because two years ago he sued Royal Holloway College for discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and for being a trade union member. The university college, in Egham, Surrey, settled that case with him out of court but the academic feels the victimisation has continued. Royal Holloway College was contesting the case at today's employment tribunal. The professor, who first went to the college in 1994, said in his statement to the tribunal: 'Professor Clare Bradley, a professor of psychology, approached me concerning my research of equalities in the academic profession - a subject in which I’m viewed as an international expert. 'She had become concerned about practices where a male academic had been proposed for promotion because he had a ‘wife and child’ to support. 'She was seeking to form a working group that would develop guidelines for non-discriminatory practices.' Head held high: Frank drew attention to pay inequality among his male and female colleagues at Royal Holloway . The professor is a leading economist at Royal Holloway and has previously taught at several Ivy League universities . Royal Holloway Principal Paul Layzell is said to have had a meeting with Frank last January. Frank claimed the principal said one of them would have to leave the college if the grievances continued . Holloway heavyweight: Layzell (centre) was accompanied by his legal team today ahead of the tribunal in Reading, Berkshire . As a result of their work an equal pay audit was carried out which uncovered an 11 per cent gender pay gap and 'unsatisfactory professorial pay determination processes.' Professor Frank said the research had personal consequences for him. 'Since I had stopped getting pay rises once I started (in 2006) publishing on sexual orientation on pay and promotions in British universities, I filed a grievance. 'I subsequently filed a sexual orientation discrimination case when my grievance wasn’t heard in a reasonable time.' He explained growing difficulties he experienced over the following years with his line manager and the Dean of his department, Professor Rosemary Deem, and with the then director of human resources, John Grimmer. The situation spread into the university’s 'banding' assessments, through which staff are graded and salaries are arranged. Steeped in tradition: The University of London college in Egham, Surrey, was founded in 1879 . One of the two quads in Founders building where undergraduates come to revise for their summer exams . Picturesque: The Founder's Picture Gallery is home to a collection of paintings worth over £16m and is often used as a venue for formal dinners . When Professor Frank got a lower grading than he expected he appealed and his pressure eventually led to outside experts being brought in to conduct their own assessment. 'I was perhaps the only professor at the college who had been invited to be visiting professor at the most prestigious international universities, Harvard University and the University of California (Berkeley). 'I had founded one of the largest and most successful departments at the college, again an accomplishment that makes me unique at the college. 'This was a record of contribution that certainly ranked high and reflected my now 18 years of experience at professorial level.' He said respected economist Alistair Ulph’s finding was that the professor should have had a higher banding, yet the college still maintained its position. High-flyer: Frank also taught at Harvard which is currently ranked the third best in the world . Roupell Street: Frank made his home on this exclusive street of Georgian houses in south London . In January 2011 he filed his latest grievance. 'I did this because I couldn’t conceive of how a 2+ banding could have been given to me without it being either sexual orientation discrimination or victimisation for my employment tribunal case, for my testifying in the equal pay case and for my serving as a union officer. He said he had a meeting on January 21 last year with the principal, Paul Layzell, after which he claimed he was told: 'If these grievances and all continue, one or other of us is going to have to leave the college.' Professor Frank is still employed by the Surrey-based and commutes from Roupell Street in south London where one house is currently selling for close to a million pound. He told the tribunal panel, in Reading, Berkshire: 'It is worth noting that despite the victimisation I have suffered throughout the last two years, I have put in an immense amount of effort on behalf of the college, successfully leading the department in a rebuilding phase. 'The department’s PhD programme and MSc programmes have doubled in size, with undergraduate enrollment growing by 50 students per year. 'Particularly in light of all this effort I have been putting in for the college, the victimisation has been very hurtful to me. 'At each juncture the college found excuses not to raise my banding. 'In addition I was discriminated against and victimised by being asked to step down prematurely as head of department and to have my post as professor threatened if I continue with my grievance.' The hearing, before Employment Judge Andrew Gumbiti-Zimuto, is expected to last five days.","Openly gay professor has a PhD from Yale and taught at Harvard .

A second man in Vermont has died from a rare but deadly brain infection transmitted through mosquitoes. Scott Sgorbati, who was only 49, died from Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), after spending weeks in intensive care. Only two weeks prior, 87-year-old Richard Hollis Breen died from the virus, which causes swelling of the brain. Fatal disease: Scott Sgorbati, left, was the second person in Vermont to die of Eastern Equine Encephalitis in two weeks; the other was 87-year-old Richard Hollis Breen, right . Transmission: EEE is transmitted through mosquitoes, and although rare, is fatal in humans in a third of cases . Mr Sgorbati, who worked as a carpenter in the small town of Sudbury, was said to have been in good health before contracting EEE. His death was confirmed earlier this week by the Vermont Department of Health. His sister-in-law Susan Sgorbati told Vermont Public Radio that he was ‘very compassionate and always there for people.’ Following the two deaths, Vermont Health Commissioner Dr Harry Chen said that the disease is still extremely rare, saying there are on average only six cases a year. ‘What’s important now is that Vermonters are aware of EEE and take steps to avoid exposure,’ he said, according to the Addison County Independent. Rarity: According to the CDC, there have been no reported cases of EEE between 1964 and 2010; Florida tops the list, with 70 reported cases since 1964 . Precautions: EEE is transmitted through mosquitoes to humans; the CDC suggests wearing long sleeves and insect repellant when out of doors to avoid contact with the pests . He called the deaths of the two men ‘a tragedy,’ but added: ‘This is a very rare disease. The risks are low.’ Virus: EEE is a member of the genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are two types of the illness. Approximately a third of those infected die from the disease, but it is only fatal when it affects the central nervous system. The symptoms of EEE are often abrupt and severe, and can include fever, headache, irritability, restlessness, drowsiness, vomiting, convulsions, and in more serious cases, coma. The most cases have been reported in Florida, with 70 cases reported since 1964. Next up was Massachusetts, with 37 cases. The CDC has no record of the disease in Vermont from 1964-2010. Now Vermont health officials are looking forward to the temperature dropping, as a cold snap will likely kill off any mosquitos carrying the disease. Until then, officials advise those outside to thoroughly coat themselves in bug repellent, wearing long sleeves and trousers, not shorts. They also say to avoid being outside at dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes are out in droves.","Scott Sgorbati, 49, contracted Eastern Equine Encephalitis and died earlier this week .

A fraudster posed as a lawyer and offered 'expert' legal advice to criminals - then landed the taxpayer with bills for his services amounting to £250,000. Despite having no legal qualifications or accreditation, Mohammed Khatana set up a cowboy consultancy firm offering guidance to crooks that faced having cash and assets seized by police under proceeds of crime laws. The 51-year-old father-of-three - who used his own daughter to act as a front for his scam - then charged vastly inflated fees for his 'services' which he claimed from the taxpayer-funded legal aid scheme. 'Ruthless fraudster': Mohammed Khatana drove a Mercedes and lived in a five bedroomed house in rural Lancashire . Preston Crown Court was told how the former property dealer - who drove a Mercedes and lived in a five bedroom house on a private estate in rural Lancashire - advertised his services via a website and in prison newspapers. He would visit clients in jail, discuss their needs, then go away and procure the necessary services for the criminals from solicitors' firms. Khatana would then double the genuine firm's quoted price, submit a legal aid claim to the Legal Services Commission, and pocket the difference himself. The court was also told how the British Muslim used 'cultural pressure' to make his daughter Mahria Khatana participate in his scheming, having her join a lawyers' association and network with defence solicitors and barristers at trade functions. When one of her father's sizeable legal aid claims was queried by a judge, the 25-year-old verified it in court. Khatana was arrested as he left a hotel near Bury after an undercover  operation led by detectives from the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit, following a three year investigation into his shady firm POCA Consulting Ltd. The sting saw an undercover policewoman pose as the girlfriend of a client to meet with Khatana, who offered her advice on how to keep her partner's money out of the reach of authorities at a cost of £20,000.

The court heard how Khatana . billed one 74-year-old client facing confiscation proceedings for money . laundering £43,000. He should have been charged just £10,000. The money was recouped by the Khatanas through legal aid at the expense of the taxpayer. Mohammed Khatana was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison after pleading guilty to 15 counts of fraud. Mahria Khatana, who admitted four counts of fraud, was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work. Passing sentence, Judge Graham Knowles QC told Khatana senior: 'Your plan from the beginning was that this business would be a vehicle for fraud. 'You are a determined and persistent and versatile professional criminal. What you did was intended to undermine the whole legal process.' Detective Superintendent Jason Hudson from the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit said: 'Khatana was a ruthless serial fraudster who was prepared to use his own daughter to steal from a wide range of individuals for his own gain. 'Cheating the taxpayer is not a victimless crime especially in these difficult times - yet this man has shown little remorse.' Matthew Coats, chief executive of the Legal Services Commission, said: 'Legal aid funding is public money and we will not tolerate people trying to defraud the taxpayer.' Mohammed Khatana has previously served time in jail for his part in smuggling amphetamine 'pill-making' machines into Britain from China during the 1990s. In a later scam he sent letters to companies up and down the country offering to register them under the then new Data Protection Act, and warning them that they could be prosecuted if they did not pay up. The firms were charged a fee of £135 for Khatana's 'service', when the true cost of registering was £35. He was jailed for four years in December 2004 and ordered to pay back almost £500,000. It was upon his release from prison that Khatana set up his shady legal advice firm POCA Consulting Ltd.","Mohammed Khatana advised crooks who faced having assets seized - despite having no legal qualifications .

A two-time Purple Heart veteran was killed while protecting his wife from a car that spun onto the sidewalk along New York City's Park Avenue on Saturday night. 'He pushed me out of the way,' Denise Baum, 62, told the New York Daily News of her husband, 80-year-old Rubin Baum, who would be swept beneath the vehicle while she was thrown into a parked truck. 'I tried to lift the car. I was so ashamed. I couldn't lift it,' Mrs Baum said while biting back tears. Ending a night out taking in a jazz performance nearby, the couple were attempting to hail a cab home on the Upper East Side when police say a black Mazda sedan ran a red light. The vehicle immediately ploughed into a northbound Toyota sienna minivan carrying a Pakistani diplomat, who has not been named, spinning the Mazda out of control. 'I stepped out from the sidewalk ... I saw a black shiny car,' Mrs Baum recalled of that life-changing moment around 10.30pm. 'He sacrificed his for life for me. He really gave me a good shove. It was in a second, he saved my life,' she told the New York Post. Despite receiving an injury to her leg, as well as a bruise to her forehead, her true horror set in when she looked over and saw her husband.

Nick Clegg suffered a humiliating setback yesterday when his party conference voted to scrap controversial plans for a major extension of ‘secret  justice’ courts. Delegates in Brighton voted overwhelmingly for the widely criticised Justice and Security Bill to be abandoned. The move means Lib Dem peers are almost certain to refuse to back the legislation in the House of Lords. Humiliating setback: Nick Clegg's party voted to scrap the controversial Justice and Security Bill on Tuesday . The Daily Mail has led criticism of the Government’s plans to allow so-called ‘closed material procedures’, in which cases are conducted entirely in private, in any civil hearing. Defendants or claimants will not be allowed to be present, know or challenge the case against them and must be represented by a security-cleared special advocate, rather than their own lawyer. Currently, such procedures are used in only a tiny number of immigration and deportation hearings, but the Government wants to extend them across the civil courts. Mr Clegg has forced the Government to make a number of concessions, including abandoning the idea of extending secret justice to inquest hearings. Voted against bill: Delegates at the Lib Dem conference in Brighton voted overwhelmingly to abandon plans for a major extension of 'secret justice' courts . But critics say the proposals still represent a fundamental breach of traditional principles of open justice, and accuse the Government of allowing the security services to dictate the legislation. Spy chiefs were deeply embarrassed by civil court claims against them by terror suspects, which had to be settled out of court rather than having sensitive intelligence material discussed in open hearings. Last night Lib Dem members voted through a motion calling on their MPs and peers to ‘press for the withdrawal or defeat’ of the Bill, even in its amended form. Baroness Ludford, the party’s European . justice and human rights spokesman and a London MEP, said: ‘Our party’s . core values are at stake on this Bill. Standing up for all the proud . traditions of our common law system – open justice, the rule of law, . accountability of the state for human rights abuses, redress for victims . – is essential.’ 'Secret justice': The plans were to allow so-called 'closed material procedures' where cases are conducted entirely in private, in any civil hearing . She added: ‘Secret courts could mean impunity for state officials complicit in wrongdoing like torture. ‘If a government puts material before a judge in private, it can’t be called proper evidence. Material which is unchallenged can positively mislead. ‘We can and should trust judges, not the state, to distinguish between genuine national security interests and attempted cover-ups. ‘Nick Clegg said we should distinguish those policies we would die in the ditch for from those we could compromise on. Please jump into the ditch on this one, Nick.’ Lib Dem peer Lord Strasburger said the proposed legislation was ‘hopelessly flawed and beyond repair’, adding: ‘This Bill is bad for transparency. It’s unfair, it’s illiberal. Disaster victims excluded: Parliamentary candidate Jo Shawsaid that the families of those killed in the Hillsborough disaster (pictured) could be excluded from court hearings just like victims of torture under the abandoned plans . He added that Mr Clegg would now have to tell David Cameron that the party would no longer support the legislation as it made its way through Parliament. Parliamentary  candidate Jo Shaw told the conference the families of those killed in the Hillsborough disaster could just as easily be excluded from court hearings as victims of torture under extraordinary rendition. ‘Evidence that has not been seen and challenged by the other side is not evidence at all. ‘Secret justice practically isn’t justice. It’s a dangerous perversion of justice.’ Sources close to the Lib Dem leadership suggested last night it would seek further changes to the legislation. Lord Wallace, a government law officer, said: ‘We will  continue to work with parliamentarians from all sides, to ensure that the principles of open justice are protected.’","Delegates at the Lib Dems conference voted for the Justice and Security Bill to be abandoned .

A boy who, aged ten, shot dead his neo-Nazi father as he slept should not be jailed as he thought it was 'the right thing to do', his lawyers have argued. Prosecutors want Joseph Hall, now 12, jailed for murder, citing a history of violent behaviour including choking a teacher with a telephone cord. He would become one of the youngest people in a U.S. correctional facility. But the boy's attorney says that he cannot be held responsible as he believed he was doing 'the right thing' by executing his 32-year-old father Jeff in Riverside County, California. Uniform: Jeff Hall seen after a skirmish during a conference of the National Socialist Movement in Pemberton, New Jersey on April 15, 2011 . Just ten when he was arrested for the killing in May last year, the small, blond child told police he pulled the gun from a closet and killed Jeff Hall - an unemployed regional leader of the National Socialist Movement who headed rallies at a synagogue. 'In reality, sometimes kids - just like all of us - do things because they want to, and he decided, as he put it, it was time to end the father-son thing,' said Michael Soccio, chief deputy district attorney. 'This child started at five years old being expelled from school for violence. His violence started way before his dad ever joined any Nazi party.' The boy's public defender, Matthew Hardy, told the New York Times his client has neurological and psychological problems and was exposed to neo-Nazi 'conditioning' at home. 'He's been conditioned to violence,' Hardy told the newspaper. 'You have to ask yourself: Did this kid really know that this act was wrong based on all those things?' Mr Hall, who had Nazi tattoos on his head, took Joseph to rallies where they performed Nazi salutes together. They also went on night-time 'patrols' by the Mexican border wearing night-vision goggles to help them 'detain illegal immigrants'. Deadly: A .357 snub nosed revolver like the one used in the killing . Opening statements are expected to begin today in the two-week trial of the boy, who is not being charged as an adult. Hall, who said he believed in a white breakaway nation, ran for a seat on the local water board in 2010 in a move that disturbed many residents in the recession-battered suburbs southeast of Los Angeles. The day before his death, he held a meeting of the neo-Nazi group at his home. Hall had previously taken the boy - his eldest of five children - on a U.S.-Mexico border patrol trip and showed him how to use a gun, according to papers filed by police against the boy's stepmother alleging child endangerment and criminal storage of a gun. Last year, the boy told investigators he went downstairs and shot his father before returning upstairs and hiding the gun under his bed, according to court documents. He told authorities he thought his father was going to leave his stepmother, and he didn't want the family to split up, Soccio said. The boy's stepmother told authorities that Hall had hit, kicked and yelled at his son for being too loud or getting in the way. Hall and the boy's biological mother had previously slugged through a divorce and custody dispute in which each had accused the other of child abuse. Kathleen M. Heide, a professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa who wrote Why Kids Kill Parents said 16 cases of children aged ten and under killing their parents were documented between 1996 and 2007. Heide also said parenting and home life would undoubtedly play a role in the case. 'It would be inaccurate to say who the child's parents are is superfluous,' she said. 'That is going to have an effect on how the child grows up, on the values that child learns, on problem solving abilities, so all of that is relevant.' If a judge finds the boy murdered Hall, he could be held in state custody until he is 23 years old, said Bill Sessa, spokesman for California's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The state currently houses fewer than 900 juveniles. 'We don't have anybody that young,' Sessa said. 'We have had 12-year-olds in the past, but it's rare.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Joseph Hall killed his father Jeff with a shot to the head as he slept .

The one-time Labour firebrand is the . father of five children by three women. Details of his unconventional . arrangements surfaced in the weeks before the 2008 mayoral election, . when he was defeated by Boris Johnson. Mr Livingstone, then supposedly a . father of two, confessed to having three secret children by two women . shortly before publication of a book detailing the relationships. Their identities remained secret until . last October when he published his life story, You Can’t Say That. He . described how he acted as sperm donor for two friends who feared they . were running out of time to have children. He hinted that they did not use . artificial insemination – suggesting he slept with the women while . living with his then partner, Kate Allen. Good relationship: Ken, pictured with his middle daughter Lottie, has financially and emotionally supported his daughters throughout their lives . His memoir revealed that the first . request for help came from Miss Need – a freelance journalist Mr . Livingstone had known for 12 years –  who ‘was very keen to have . children, although she had not found the right partner and the clock was . ticking. ‘We had never been involved . romantically but I knew her well enough to know she would be a wonderful . mother and so I said I would like to be the father of her children. I’d . be around taking an interest and supporting them emotionally, but we . agreed that I would not be living with them.’ Miss Need’s first child with Mr . Livingstone, Georgia, was born in August 1990 and Charlotte – known as . Lottie – in September 1992. Both daughters took their mother’s surname.

Weeks after his second daughter was . born, political activist Janet Woolf gave birth to his first son, Liam, . in November 1992 in the same north London hospital.

At least three tornadoes touched down in Southwestern Illinois on Tuesday evening with reports of golf ball-sized hail and strong winds ravaging several communities. At least two semis were reported toppled from strong winds on I-64 near Okawville, hospitalizing two, with several roofs, buildings and at least three homes also damaged throughout Washington County, KSDK reports. The trucker in one overturned rig was slightly injured, Okawville Police Chief Steve Millikin said, with two taken to Washington County, Illinois hospital. Any additional injuries from the storm have not been reported. Scroll down for video . Touching down: At least three tornadoes touched down in Southern Illinois on Tuesday evening while five or six funnel clouds were additionally spotted . Strength: A funnel cloud is captured from a highway, one of several spotted whose strong winds in all would tear off roofs and turn over at least two semis . Building: Tornado warnings were in effect in Eastern Washington County until 6.15pm and Jefferson County until 6.45pm as the residents braced for the worst . Bracing: Residential homes are pictured awaiting the storm that would rip steal beams from farm roofs and level at least one house under construction . Toppled: At least two semi trucks toppled from the strong winds, sending two to the hospital including one driver who was slightly injured . The National Weather Service confirmed three of the tornadoes while five or six additional funnel clouds were spotted but never touched ground. Chief Millikin says the tornado he videotaped on his dashboard camera clipped the northern edge of his 1,400-resident village on Tuesday night about where the storm leveled a house under construction. With in some cases golf ball-size hail reported by residents, KTVI captured one woman's back window of her car shattered by hail while driving down Interstate 64 in Okawville. Of the three tornadoes KSDK reports one touching down near Damiansville while moving east at approximately 25 MPH. Shattered: A woman's back windshield is pictured after she said large hail caused it to shatter while driving along an interstate . Hail: Most of largest sized hail reported by residents was the size of a golf ball while others got as large as a tennis ball, pictured . Comparisons: Residents were quick to post photos of the hail sizes found in their communities that accompanied 4 to 6 inches of rain .

Spreading: Dark clouds are seen spreading near some roadways with one twister reported moving approximately 25MPH . Taking over: Residents are seen driving before the storm's heavy wall as it begins to encompass the town's sky . Threats: In addition to strong winds, hail and lightning, a gas leak as well as a transformer fire also kept firefighters busy in Addieville . The weather service says parts of southern Illinois also received 4 to 6 inches of rain since Tuesday night. Approximately 40 miles west of Okawville, however, flooding  was reported closing westbound lanes of Forest Park Parkway in St Louis, Missouri well into early Wednesday morning.

It is a key ingredient of such quintessentially British snacks as the ploughman’s lunch and the cheese and pickle sandwich. But after 90 years, Branston Pickle has been sold to a Japanese firm. The £92.5million deal comes just months after the boss of the brand’s parent company, Premier Foods, urged British shoppers to be more patriotic. Branston is the latest in a long line of traditional brands – including Sarson’s vinegar and Weetabix – to be sold abroad. Meanwhile, the makers of HP Sauce, who are running a television campaign highlighting its British roots, are under fire for moving production to Holland. Premier, which acquired Branston in 2002, announced yesterday that it had sold it to Mizkan of Japan. The deal includes the factory that makes Branston in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, along with the 356-strong workforce. Branston is popular beyond Britain, with strong sales in the US, Canada, Australia, Norway, Singapore, Germany and Turkey. Despite this, Mizkan, which has a 200-year history in the Japanese food industry, has no plans to sell the pickle in its home market.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:17 EST, 29 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:17 EST, 29 October 2012 . MPs warned last night that NHS hospitals could go bust as a result of Labour’s botched PFI deals. Many trusts’ chances of breaking even were being undermined by ‘unaffordable’ contracts with private sector companies under the much-derided private finance initiative, the Public Accounts Committee said. But members also criticised the present Government for having no idea how to respond if a trust does go bankrupt and is forced to close down – saying the controversial reforms imposed on the NHS could make things worse. Former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley put South London NHS Trust in the failure regime - the trust was losing more than £1 million per week . They said it appeared the Department of Health was ‘inventing rules and processes on the hoof’ to deal with hospital trusts which get into financial difficulties. It raises the possibility of communities being left without vital services because managers at their local trust have not been able to keep the organisation solvent. At least 22 trusts, running 60 units, are facing severe problems as a result of PFI burdens, and earlier this year the DoH had to put in £1.5billion to bail them out. But the Coalition’s reforms will devolve the vast majority of the NHS budget to GPs, meaning there will be less available for the central department to prop up failing trusts. The committee said ministers had done nothing to establish a robust protocol for action should a hospital go bust. Chairman Margaret Hodge said ministers were unable to provide MPs with reassurance that financial problems will not damage the quality of care or access experienced by patients of troubled trusts, at a time when the service is already struggling to find £20billion-worth of cuts. Although NHS bodies reported an overall surplus of £2.1billion in 2011-12, the apparently healthy financial picture masked a ‘significant minority’ of bodies which are in difficulties, said the report. Ten NHS trusts, 21 foundation trusts and three primary care trusts reported a combined deficit of £356million, £115million of which was accounted for by two London trusts, one of which was put into special administration in July. Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said ministers were unable to provide reassurance to MPs that financial problems within NHS trusts would not damage care quality . A further 31 struggling NHS trusts and 11 foundation trusts may not have broken even if they had not been bailed out with cash injections worth £1.1billion from the department and other NHS organisations, said the report. During the committee’s inquiry into the future financial sustainability of the NHS, the department was unable to explain clearly how the ‘failure regime’ would work under the new arrangements, or what circumstances would trigger it being applied to a struggling hospital. 'Ensuring a viable financial future for healthcare providers is vital if the public are to have confidence in the delivery of their local services,' said the report. 'Yet we still do not have critical details of how the new system introduced by the NHS reforms will work so that services remain available to patients in their locality.' Mrs Hodge said: 'The Department of Health could not explain to us how it will deal with an NHS trust that goes bankrupt. Nor could it provide reassurance that financial problems would not damage the quality of care or equality of access to all citizens, wherever they live. She added: 'We are particularly concerned that the financial viability of a number of trusts is being undermined by the fact that they are locked into unaffordable PFI contracts. 'It is unclear how the department will continue to underwrite payments once most of the money moves to the NHS Commissioning Board.’ The MPs’ warning came on the day that administrators of an NHS trust on the brink of bankruptcy said it should be dissolved, with the possibility that one of its hospitals will be run by a private company. The South London NHS trust was losing more than £1million a week. Special administrator Matthew Kershaw said a nearby A&E department should close down and the Princess Royal hospital in Farnborough, near Bromley, should be taken over by another provider. Former health secretary Andrew Lansley put the trust in the failure regime after it emerged that it ran up deficits of more than £150million over the past three years. Sources close to Mr Lansley said long-standing difficulties had been made worse by two PFI deals which are now costing £61million a year in interest. Mr Kershaw said PFI debts accounted for ‘around a third’ of the trust’s £65million overspend in the last financial year.","Trusts' chances of breaking even are being hit by 'unaffordable' contracts with private sector companies .

The number of serious water pollution incidents has doubled in a year, the Environment Agency showed today. Pollution incidents in the water industry rose from 65 in 2010 to 120 in 2011 and most occurred within the sewer and water network. It comes as the agency awarded more companies than ever the highest ‘A’ rating for their environmental performance. Pollution peril: An Environment Agency worker treats water in Staffordshire, contaminated with untreated sewage and cyanide as an agency report found serious incidents in the water industry increased, mostly in the sewer and water network . Overall serious industrial pollution incidents across all sectors including industry, water, waste and farming fell slightly to 620 last year. Last year's figure was a 4 per cent drop on 2010 and down more than half on the figures for 2000, the latest sustainable business report revealed. The Environment Agency suggested that some of the increase in serious water pollution incidents was due to a rise in the amount reported by the water companies themselves, but self-reporting increased only slightly last year. An agency spokesman said: ‘Substantial investment by water companies has helped improve water quality in recent decades. ‘We are working with the water industry and Ofwat to ensure that this overall trend continues, particularly given the pressures of population growth and climate change.’ Illegal waste sites: The Environment Agency shut down 759 sites last year and improved detection had identified 1,175 illegal sites in England and Wales . In general, pollution such as waste . fires and uncontrolled releases from industry or of sewage can pose a . risk to life, destroy habitats, affect drinking water supplies and . prevent people from using and enjoying their local environment, the . agency said. They found that overall, the environmental performance by businesses is improving. With more companies than ever being awarded the highest rating, the agency cut regulatory costs for well-run businesses by £15 million last year. Operators who comply fully with permits governing how their site is run paid nearly 70 per cent less last year in regulatory fees than those who performed badly. Just 184 of almost 14,000 sites which require a permit to operate have been given the lowest ratings for two years or more, causing problems for neighbours and the community. The most common public complaint about such sites is bad smells. The Environment Agency also said it had shut down 759 illegal waste sites last year. Improved detection by its recently formed specialist illegal waste sites taskforce had identified 1,175 illegal sites in England and Wales and shutting them down is the taskforce's top priority, the agency said. Not easy: Environment Agency chairman Lord Chris Smith said achieving economic growth and protecting the natural environment at the same time is not always easy but can be achieved . Environment Agency chairman Lord Chris Smith said: ‘Achieving both economic growth and the protection of the natural environment is not always easy but can be achieved. ‘It will not happen without effective regulation of the impact business has on the environment and a commitment from businesses themselves to act as responsible neighbours and good corporate citizens. ‘Reassuringly, the latest performance record shows businesses are increasingly recognising there is a value and opportunity in this broader sense of responsibility. ‘However, there's no room for complacency as a minority of businesses are still bad neighbours and the environmental impacts from their activities result in complaints from local communities.’","An Environment Agency report found pollution incidents in the water industry rose from 65 in 2010 to 120 in 2011 .

But Terry insisted he was sarcastically repeating an accusation by Ferdinand. Janice also had to look on as her elder son Rio, 33, was hit with a £45,000 FA fine for improper conduct after calling Ashley Cole a ‘choc-ice’ on Twitter. A user, believed to be a man from the Derbyshire area, referred to Chelsea star Cole as a 'choc ice' on the site. Rio then replied: 'I hear you fella! Choc ice is classic hahahahahaha!!' Key moment: Terry and QPR's Anton Ferdinand clash during the Barclays Premier League match at Loftus Road .

Let down: Jeanette Goodwin, 47, had made seven reports to Essex Police from January last year about harassment and domestic violence from Bunch before he murdered her in a horrific knife-attack . A police force has been slammed for failing to dispatch officers to a woman who warned them five times she felt scared shortly before she was stabbed to death by her ex lover. Jeanette Goodwin, 47, was murdered in a horrific knife-attack at her home in Southend, Essex, in July 2011. Her jealous former lover Martin Bunch, 44, had stalked the mother of three for months before stabbing her more than 30 times. The obsessive ex had been unable to accept his eight-year affair with the married mother-of-three had come to an end and attacked her in front of her husband of 21 years, Mark Goodwin . And today, an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) report has revealed a string of failings by Essex Police and the justice system to deal with Bunch, who was jailed for life for the killing. Mrs Goodwin had made seven reports to police from January last year about harassment and domestic violence from Bunch. And on the day of her death, the personal assistant had again phoned police at 2.40pm to report further harassment, stating five times that she was scared and that Martin Bunch had been at her garden fence. But, amazingly, the member of police staff in the control room failed to even note on the log that she was scared and no background or intelligence checks were made. Police then had no further contact that day until Mrs Goodwin pressed a panic alarm installed at her home at about 7.40pm. But by the time officers arrived, Bunch had repeatedly stabbed Mrs Goodwin, leaving her to bleed to death on her garden patio. Obsessive: Martin Bunch, 44, had been unable to accept his eight-year affair with the married mother-of-three had come to an end and attacked her in front of her husband at her home in Southend, Essex, right . The IPCC report concluded that limited . staff on a busy day meant that the fateful phone call from Mrs Goodin . was not treated as an urgent matter. Rachel . Cerfontyne, IPCC Commissioner, said: 'The system in place was badly . flawed, not utilising intelligence checks to inform decision-making when . prioritising incidents. 'The call taker’s perception of Mrs Goodwin’s calmness and her stated intention to go out shopping were wrongly used as a reason not to dispatch officers. Devastated: Bunch was seen mouthing offensive comments from the dock at Mr Goodwin (pictured) as the grieving husband gave evidence during the trial. 'There was a failure to recognise, in . the light of the known history of this case, that Mr. Bunch’s presence . close to her home, in breach of his bail conditions, required immediate . and urgent action to try and arrest him. 'He . had clearly become obsessed with her, his persistent stalking and . harassment were strong indicators of how dangerous he was.' The report stated that although police had taken Bunch’s actions seriously in the months leading up to the killing, there had also been failings from the courts to put the jealous former lover behind bars. Bunch was convicted of battery on June 21 - just a month before the murder - yet he was given just a conditional discharge. Police had also arrested him three times for breaching his bail conditions following a separate incident including for having removed his electronic tag, yet twice he was released by the magistrates’ court on bail. The IPCC investigation said police had taken Mrs Goodwin’s reports of domestic violence seriously from the outset, putting Bunch before the courts on several occasions, strongly urging his remand in custody, on the basis it was the only way to effectively protect Mrs Goodwin. Mrs Goodwin had a safety alarm installed in her home and officers help develop a mutit-agency a safety plan. As a result of the IPCC investigation, four members of police staff working in the force control room and one police officer have received performance debriefs from a senior officer. Investigation: A forensic tent in the back garden of Mark and Jeanette's family home where she was found collapsed on the ground. The IPCC report concluded that limited staff on a busy day meant that the fateful phone call from Mrs Goodin was not treated as an urgent matter . None of the failings were judged to be misconduct though. Reacting to the findings, Mrs Chambers’ family said in an emotional statement: 'Bunch on many occasions had been arrested for his part in harassing Jeanette. 'Bail conditions were set and he was repeatedly tagged which he showed complete disregard to by ultimately removing these, enabling this murderer to get even closer to our Jeanette, until finally the justice system allowed him to commit the unbelievable act of murder. June 21 2011 - Bunch is convicted of battery against Mrs Goodwin (pictured) and given a conditional discharge. June - Bunch arrested again for harassment and an allegation of actual bodily harm, unrelated to Mrs Goodwin. June - Magistrates release Bunch on bail despite police pleas to have him remanded in custody for Mrs Goodwin's safety. June/July - Bunch arrested a further two times for breaching his bail conditions. July 14 - Bunch arrested and later bailed for a third breach of removing his electronic tag. July 24, 2.40pm - Mrs Goodwin phones police and tells them she is scared five times. Her fears are not logged and no background checks are made. July 24, 7.40pm - She sounds panic alarm but police arrive too late due to understaffing. July 24, 8.10pm - Police arrest Bunch at his mothers house after he confesses to murder. 'This criminal system has to change and the appropriate measures must be taken to ensure that these tags cannot be removed and that criminals for stalking or domestic violence repeatedly breaching bail must be given a mandatory prison sentence before this horrific crime is committed to another loving mother. 'Unfortunately we will never know whether this would have had an impact on saving Jeanette’s life, but we would hope that it will help other victims. We are determined to do all that we can to ensure MPs and the Ministry of Justice take action and revise the justice system and the law.' Assistant Chief Constable of Essex Police, Derek Benson, said: I have apologised to Jeanette Goodwin’s family for our failings. 'The IPCC report found shortcomings in respect of four members of police staff and one acting police sergeant. The IPCC concluded that their actions did not amount to misconduct but did require debriefing with a senior officer to address performance measures, which has been done. 'The initial call on Sunday, July 24, 2011, by Mrs Goodwin, should have been treated more seriously, and a unit dispatched. 'Too much emphasis was placed on Mrs Goodwin saying she was going out and would not be in until 4.30pm, rather than her stating she was scared of Bunch. There is however no way of knowing if our actions at this time had been different whether Mrs Goodwin would still have been murdered. Sentencing Bunch earlier this year Judge Charles Gratwicke branded the killer 'savage and brutal'.

Two more British soldiers were killed yesterday by a rogue Afghan policeman. Their deaths prompted a former government minister to call for British troops to leave Afghanistan by Christmas. The shooting of the troops - from the 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles - by an Afghan they believed to be on their side takes the number of British servicemen and women killed in so-called 'green on blue' insider attacks to 11. Partnership: British soldiers helping to re-establish government control in an area of Helmand province . The figure represents a quarter of all UK forces to die in the conflict this year. Labour’s former Europe minister Denis McShane urged the Prime Minister to bring the entire 9,500-strong UK force home by Christmas, rather than wait until the end of 2014 for the scheduled final withdrawal. Conservative MP Bob Stewart, who commanded UN troops in Bosnia, said ‘green on blue’ incidents had reached ‘enormous proportions’ and the Afghan authorities’ efforts to vet recruits to root out insurgents was ‘clearly not working’. He told the BBC: ‘Enough is enough. This has gone on too long. We should get our troops out as fast as possible. ‘It’s not as easy to pull stumps as some people suggest, but we should get them out as fast as possible.’ However, defence chiefs have insisted the drawdown process should not be derailed by ‘insider attacks’. Yesterday’s deaths at a checkpoint in the Nahr-e-Saraj area of Helmand took the number of NATO’s International Security Assistance Force to die this year alone in attacks by Afghans wearing police or army uniforms to 56. Both soldiers were from 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles and were killed in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand . Province. A spokesman for Task Force Helmand, Major Laurence Roche, said: 'I am saddened to report the deaths of two soldiers from 1st Battalion . The Royal Gurkha Rifles who were shot and killed by a man wearing an . Afghan police uniform at a checkpoint in the Nahr-e Saraj district of . Helmand Province. 'The loss of these soldiers is a huge blow to The Royal Gurkha Rifles . and everyone serving in Task Force Helmand.  Our thoughts are with their . families, friends and fellow Gurkhas at this time.' The soldiers next of kin have been informed. An Afghan police official in the southern province of Helmand said efforts were underway to apprehend the policeman involved. So-called insider attacks on Western forces have undermined trust between coalition and Afghan forces as NATO prepares to withdraw most combat troops by the end of 2014. United: International troops have been working with Afghan soldiers in the region . Just last week two U.S. and one Australian soldier were shot and killed by a man in an Afghan police uniform. The attacks come despite the Afghan government launching a large-scale push to re-screen thousands of security forces, trying to identify infiltrators or those who might not be considered secure. The Taliban have said they are using the attacks as a specific strategy to drive a wedge between the international coalition and the Afghans. Last Wednesday, the leader of the Afghan Taliban, Mullah Mohammad Omar, released a statement saying insurgents would increase the number of insider attacks against coalition and Afghan forces. In an emailed statement congratulating Muslims as they prepare to celebrate the Eid al-Adha holiday, Mullah Mohammad Omar urged 'every brave Afghan in the ranks of the foreign forces and their Afghan hirelings ... to strike them.' 'Jihadist activities inside the . circle of the state militias are the most effective stratagem. Its . dimension will see further expansion, organization and efficiency,' he . said. 'Increase your efforts to expand the area of infiltration in the ranks of the enemy. The . killings have stretched to the breaking point a partnership that U.S. and NATO officials consider a key part their exit plan - preparing the . Afghans to take over responsibility for their country’s security in just . over two years’ time. The program, where Afghans and international troops are supposed to work 'shoulder to shoulder,' is now being re-evaluated. Last week it was revealed two British . soldiers shot dead in Afghanistan may have been the victims of a revenge . attack by local police. Former attack: Corporal Channing Day (left), 25, and Corporal . David O'Connor (right), 27, are believed to have been shot dead by an . Afghan policeman . Operation: A British army officer from 1st Battalion Princess of Wales Royal Regiment in Helmand earlier this year . The growing trend of so-called 'green-on-blue' attacks in Afghanistan is becoming of increasing concern after a surge in numbers this year. Officially, nine British troops have died at the hands of Afghan colleagues so far this year. That figure does not include today's deaths, also believed to be 'insider attacks', as well as the deaths of Army medic Corporal Channing Day and Royal Marine Corporal David O'Connor last week, which are still being investigated. The growing number of British troops killed by Afghan colleagues this year compares to just one such death in 2011, prompting calls for a faster withdrawal of Britain's armed forces in Afghanistan. The planned draw-down will see the withdrawal of combat troops in the country by the end of 2014. Conservative MP Bob Stewart, who commanded UN troops in Bosnia as an army colonel, said last month that green-on-blue incidents had reached 'enormous proportions' and the Afghan authorities' efforts to vet recruits to root out insurgents was 'clearly not working'. He told the BBC: 'Enough is enough. This has gone on too long. We should get our troops out as fast as possible. It's not as easy to pull stumps as some people suggest, but we should get them out as fast as possible.' Labour's former Europe minister Denis McShane also urged the Prime Minister to bring the entire 9,500-strong force home by Christmas, rather than waiting until the end of 2014 for final withdrawal.And earlier this month, relatives marking the 11th anniversary of the start of the war echoed that demand. But defence chiefs have insisted the draw-down process should not be derailed by 'insider attacks'. Speaking last week, Mr Hammond said: 'We are pulling out of Afghanistan. We have a plan to end our combat role by the end of 2014, to draw down significantly during the course of next year but on the way to continue our task of training, mentoring the Afghans so that they can take over the security role. 'Overall the security picture across Afghanistan is steadily improving, I am confident about that, but this is not suburban England and it never will be.' And Brigadier Doug Chalmers, the outgoing commander of Task Force Helmand, said although the number of green-on-blue attacks rose during his six-month tour, it did not dent soldiers' resolve. 'We suffered three incidents on our tour which left seven of our soldiers killed,' he said. 'Numerically, the insider threat did go up on our tour. We knew that within the brigade. Of all the casualties we have suffered these are without a shadow of a doubt the hardest to bear.' But he said the issue was with 'individuals not institutions', adding: 'The green-on-blue element of the insider threat is a risk and it does add to the pressure but it is just one of many risks that our soldiers face every day. 'I visited all of our teams throughout the tour and their sense of commitment and belief in what they were doing was simply very, very strong. 'I visited the teams after they had lost soldiers due to insider attacks, all of them still had absolutely firm belief in the task they were doing and were back on the job within 48 hours.' Corporal Channing Day, 25, of 3 Medical Regiment and Corporal David O’Connor, 27, of 40 Commando, Royal Marines, were previously thought to have been caught up in a so-called ‘friendly fire’ incident. But after interviewing witnesses and recovering fragments of ammunition, Royal Military Police investigators have ruled out the theory that the pair were shot by British Forces. A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman confirmed that the deaths were caused by ‘a third party... not UK personnel’. And Defence Secretary Philip Hammond – asked whether the British personnel had been killed in a ‘green on blue’ attack, when Afghan personnel turn on their British partners – said: ‘There is a possibility that that is what has happened but it is not clear at this stage.’","Killings are latest in a rash of 'green-on-blue' attacks, in which Afghan security forces turn their weapons on foreign troops .

Pressing ahead: Michael Gove has said he will axe legal quotas of school fields for team sports . Michael Gove yesterday vowed to press ahead with rule changes that could see hundreds of schools sell off their playing fields. The Education Secretary remained defiant over his plans to scrap regulations setting out the minimum space schools must provide for team games, facing down critics by telling them they were simply wrong. Opponents say the rule change - due to come into force tomorrow - will make it easier for schools to justify cutting back the size of their playing fields. Since details of the move were first revealed as Britain celebrated Olympics success, an online petition has attracted more than 150,000 signatures demanding a rethink. Challenging Mr Gove in the Commons yesterday, Nic Dakin, Labour MP for Scunthorpe, said: 'Considering the need to preserve our Olympic legacy, what does the Secretary of State have to say to those 150,000 people who signed a petition against his plans which will come into force this Wednesday to scrap minimum size regulations for school playing fields?' Mr Gove replied: 'I admire their passion, but they are wrong.' Under the current rules, schools must provide between 2,500 and 75,000 square metres of space for team games depending on the number of pupils they educate. In future, they will merely be required to provide 'suitable outdoor space' for physical education and play. The current detailed table of minimum space requirements will be rewritten and simplified but will be laid down in non-binding guidance rather than law. The Department for Education says the rule change is needed to allow more school places to be created quickly and cheaply to accommodate a surge in the birth rate. Officials also say that schools will find the new rules easier to follow because bureaucratic restrictions have been removed, allowing heads to decide what is best for their pupils. But Labour claims the move could lead to 'salami slicing' of school pitches. An Early Day Motion tabled in the Commons by Labour leader Ed Miliband to demand the scrapping of the new regulations has been signed so far by more than a dozen MPs. Opposition: 150,000 people have signed a petition and shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg commented on the importance of having good sports facilities . Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: 'We need our schools to have the best possible sports facilities so that we encourage a new generation of Olympic athletes, and healthy and active young people. 'By telling schools they no longer need proper playing fields the Government is letting down our young people. 'Labour believes all pupils should have access to playing fields, regardless of where they go to school. David Cameron said he wanted to 'spread privilege' in education - he should show he means it by reversing this decision before even more damage to school sport is done. 'If David Cameron believes in school sport he should back Labour's motion to protect school playing fields.' But the DfE defended the move. A spokesman said: 'For the first time these regulations require all schools to provide space for all the activities in their PE curriculum and for outdoor play. 'We have made the rules much easier for schools to follow by removing bureaucratic restrictions and freeing schools up to decide what is best for their pupils.' Minimum requirements: In the future, schools will merely be required to provide 'suitable outdoor space' for physical education and play . He said that previous rules on playing fields favoured outdoor team sports, with no requirement for schools to have space for activities in the curriculum or for play time. The Coalition has come under intense pressure over its strategy for creating an Olympic legacy through schools. It faced criticism for scrapping a scheme aimed at building links between schools and clubs and reducing the amount of ring-fenced cash for school sport. Its record on the sale of school pitches also came under fire with revelations that more than 30 had been sold off since 2010 despite a pledge to protect them in the Coalition agreement. Some decisions to allow sales had been taken against the advice of a panel of experts. The Government has also allowed schools to drop a target to offer at least two hours of PE a week.","New rules will make it easier for schools to cut back size of playing fields .

Satellite mismanagement has left America facing a data gap that will leave weather forecasters unable to predict to the movements of major storms, it has emerged. As states along east coast batten down the hatches in anticipation of the arrival of Hurricane Sandy, there are claims the country will be left blind to oncoming storms as ageing weather satellites wear out. Experts are growing increasingly alarmed, with official estimates showing that the U.S. will be left with a gap of coverage for two years from 2016 that could 'threaten life and property'. Satellite image of Hurricane Sandy: Wear and . tear of U.S.'s ageing weather satellites could mean valuable images like . this are a thing of the past, leaving forecasters blind to potentially . devastating weather . Most of the information forecasters have been able to gather about the path of Hurricane Sandy has been gathered thanks to orbiters which travel from pole to pole, gathering information as they go. On the basis of that data they now know that Sandy has strengthened to nearly 1,000 miles wide with deadly winds in excess of 85mph, leading them to issue warnings to the 50million people living in its path. The New Jersey shore is expected to take the brunt of the massive weather front - which forecasters said could be the largest in U.S. history - as Sandy hits near Atlantic City around 2am on Tuesday and churns north. The worst of the accelerating Category 1 storm is expected to bring a 'life-threatening' surge of seawater up to 11ft high, coastal hurricane winds and a barrage of heavy snow in the Appalachian Mountains. The view from space: Most of the forecasts about the path of Hurricane Sandy have been made thanks to data from orbiters which travel from pole to pole, gathering information as they go . Users of the iPhone's voice-activated assistant Siri would have have got a shock if they relied on it for forecasts about the weather in New York this week. One user who asked their phone about the storm which has led to the shut down of almost the entire U.S. East Coast and got the response: 'I don't see any reports of hurricanes.' Unfortunately for Apple, the iPhone user in question is a member of staff on BuzzFeed, one of New York's leading social news websites. She tried again, this time asking whether Siri knew of any reports of incoming thunderstorms. Siri answered again in the negative. 'No, I don't see any thunderstorms,' the app told her. The New York Times reported how 84 per cent of the data used for Hurricane Sandy forecasts has come from the Joint Polar Satellite System. This system uses satellites which fly pole-to-pole orbits each day carrying instruments to sense atmospheric moisture, temperature and other important weather-influencing factors. However, the NYT reports how no less than three independent reviews carried out this summer into the U.S.'s $13billion weather satellite programme have raised serious concerns with its implementation. The Commerce Department’s inspector general, the Government Accountability Office, and a team of outside experts each questioned cost estimates, criticised managers and called for urgent remedies. The outside team were particularly damning in their assessment of the programme, which is run jointly by Nasa and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA), condemning it as 'dysfunctional'. Most worrying among their findings were that existing polar satellites were reaching the end of their lives, and in some cases had exceeded them, and delays have seen the launch of replacements has slip back to 2017 and 2022. Craig Craft, commissioner of emergency management for Nassau County on Long Island, directly in the path of Sandy, told the NYT his team 'cannot afford to lose' any early warning systems. In 1938 the area he is responsible for was struck by a hurricane that resulted in hundreds of deaths, and Mr Craft said he needed precise forecasts to know when to evacuate vulnerable people like nursing home residents. 'Without accurate forecasts it is hard to know when to pull that trigger,' he added.","Ageing satellites expected to wear out by 2016, leaving an expected gap in coverage of two years .

The taxpayer has spent thousands of pounds on media training for gaffe-prone ministers to learn how not to looked daft on the television. Eight government departments have been forced to admit at least 19 ministers have been dispatched to courses on how to smile for the camera, deliver soundbites and dodge tricky questions from journalists. Companies hired by the government tell politicians how media interviews are ‘a mixture of opportunity and danger’ as ministers claimed that without the training, the public would not ‘understand’ what they were doing to the country. Liberal Democrat Ed Davey has been sent on media training twice - once when a junior business minister and then again when he became Energy Secretary and joined the Cabinet . Several departments refused to say how much the courses cost, claiming it breached commercial confidentiality. But the total bill is estimated to run into thousands of pounds. Labour . MP Luciana Berger, who unearthed the figures, said ministers should . stop worrying about how they look on TV and get on with running the . country. One . Cabinet minister - Energy Secretary Ed Davey - has been sent on media . training twice, though Miss Berger questioned whether he got ‘value for . money’. In . June 2010 when a minister at the Department for Business, Innovation . and Climate Change Mr Davey had £700 worth of media training. Then . in July this year, the Department for Energy and Climate Change spent . another £2,160 on extra training for Mr Davey with private firm Electric . Airwaves, which has previously worked with the Disney empire. Earlier . this month Mr Davey was caught off guard by questions about David . Cameron's shock announcement about forcing energy firms to give . customers the lowest tariff. Mr Davey tore off his microphone and called . a halt to an interview. According . to a series of parliamentary questions, 19 ministers have received . media training since in coalition was formed in May 2012. TV training: Among the ministers given tips on how to deal with the media were (top row l-r) Peter Luff, Crispin Blunt, Lord McNally and Lord Freud. (bottom row l-r) Maria Miller, John Hayes,Henry Bellingham and Lynne Featherstone . Miss Berger told MailOnline: ’It’s . astounding that 19 out of touch ministers have spent at least £12,000 – the . equivalent of one classroom assistant - on media training. ’Government departments are stocked full of press officers, why weren’t these minsters able to get training from them? ’Instead of worrying about how they look on TV minsters should focus on delivering for the public.’ Five ministers at the Ministry of Justice have been trained in how to deal with journalists. Crispin . Blunt and Jonathan Djanogly, who were both fired in last month’s . reshuffle, attended a £3,000 session with Lib Dem minister Lord McNally, . provided by the Chartered Institute of Public Relations on 19 July . 2010. In-house training was also given to Mr Blunt and new ministers Jeremy Wright and Helen Grant. Ms . Grant defended the spending, saying there is ‘a high level of interest . in the work of the Ministry of Justice and it is right that the public . know and understand the work of the Department’. She . added: ‘The training was designed to aid ministers so they are able to . clearly communicate to the public the work of the Ministry of Justice . and the reforms that are being undertaken across our policy areas.’ Lord Henley, a former environment and crime minister, made the news last year - for winning first prize at the World Marmalade Awards . The Department for Work and Pensions said training had been given to welfare minister Lord Freud and Maria Miller, who was promoted to the Cabinet as Culture Secretary in last month’s reshuffle. The training was given by Sara Jones Associates Ltd, but the ministry refused to say how much it cost. Recycling minister Lord Taylor was given media training at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs twice, in October 2011 and again in February this year. He has since been promoted to the Home Office. At the Foreign Office media training has been given to Henry Bellingham, who was sacked in the reshuffle, and Alistair Burt. Together with French lessons for Europe Minister David Lidington, the training bill came to £4,620. The Department of Health paid £500 for one unnamed minister to be trained by private firm Millbank Media which warns clients that interviews ‘present a mixture of opportunity and danger’. The company promises: ‘We’ll help you to work out what your story is, define your key messages and then show you how to articulate them in lively, accessible and persuasive language.’ In addition to Mr Davey’s £700 of training, the Business department spent another £1,400 to train John Hayes and Baroness Wilcox. The Home Office said it had sent Lib Dem Lynne Featherstone on ‘a half-day media and presentation training session’. She is now at the Department for International Development. Lord Henley, a former environment and crime prevention minister who last year won the top prize at the World Marmalade Awards, was also given a ‘two-hour media training session’. The Ministry of Defence’s ’internal media and communications training organisation’ trained Lord Astor and Peter Luff, who was ousted in the reshuffle. The departments for Education, Communities and Local Government, Transport, International Development, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and the Cabinet Office said no ministers had been given media training.","At least 19 government ministers have had lessons in dealing with journalists, costing thousands of pounds .

A school nurse accused of chasing a pupil down a corridor and pushing her against a door after enduring a torrent of abuse from the 'volatile' schoolgirl could be struck off. Theodora Armah is alleged to have lost her temper and pursued the girl - described as 'one of the nastiest kids in school' - after being sworn at by the Year 8 student at an east London girls' school, a misconduct hearing was told. Armah, described as a 'calm and collected person' by colleagues, denies chasing the girl through the corridors at break time at Haggerston School in Hackney, and pushing her against a door outside the headteacher's office. 'Calm and collected': School nurse Theodorah Armah is alleged to have . assaulted a Year 8 pupil after losing her temper on a visit to . Haggerston School in Hackney . Fellow nurse Doreen Patterson said she saw Armah chasing a group of girls before returning to the classroom. ‘I saw a group of girls running towards us and Ms Armah in pursuit of the girls running behind them,' she told the Nursing and Midwifery Council. 'We asked what had happened and she just smiled and carried on running. ‘Ms Armah came back and said a pupil had called her a f****** b****. ‘She said she had chased after the student to find out why she was being rude. ‘She caught up with the student and was able to ask this.’ The hearing was told how nurses were regularly abused by students when they visited the girls secondary school. One nurse was called a ‘f****** p****’ by a different pupil, but the health professionals who visited the school to offer vaccinations and carry out other medical checks were afraid to report the abuse, the council was told. ‘The girls were very aggressive and rude on this day’, Ms Patterson said. ‘When I asked some of the girls to wait outside, one came up to me and shouted at me. ‘I felt very threatened because there was no one to support me,' she added. She told the hearing her boss did not want to help ‘because most of the children are in gangs’. 'Challenging': Armah is accused of lashing out at a Year 8 pupil during a health visit at Haggerston School in East London . Ms Patterson added that Armah had been verbally abused by a student the day before she is accused of lashing out. Armah allegedly harangued the unnamed pupil before violently attacking her, a claim she vehemently denies. The hearing was told the girl, referred as child A, had a history of abusive outbursts and was on a child protection register. Grace Rooney, from Hackney's school nursing service, who investigated the alleged attack on child A, described her as one of ‘the nastiest kids in the school’, and noted: ‘She can even attack you physically within a second.’ Defending Armah, David Welch said child A had climbed out of school windows in the past, and once danced on a teacher’s desk. ‘She was an extremely volatile child’, he said, to which Ms Rooney answered: ‘There are children who have challenging behaviour.’ ‘This is not challenging is it’, Mr Welch said. ‘It’s downright dangerous.’ Fellow nurse Doreen Patterson . The alleged assault by Armah happened on December 10, 2009, during a regular visit to the school on behalf of City and Hackney Community Health Services. Ms Rooney said headteacher Dr Jane Keeley overheard the argument between Armah and the girl and came out moments after the alleged attack. ‘It was the break for all students and Dr Keeley heard raised voices in the corridor’, Ms Rooney said. ‘That’s why she came out of her office. ‘It was break but I do believe it wasn’t just the noise of children having a break.’ The incident was not reported to the police or social services, which Ms Rooney accepted was a ‘major oversight’. It took almost two months for the school to get a full account from child A of what happened. Mr Welch suggested the reasons she was reluctant to co-operate with the investigation was because she had invented the allegations. Ms Patterson said Armah is a ‘calm and collected person’, and doubted she would have lost her temper in this way. ‘She is not the type of person to be accused of something like this’, she said. ‘The school should take some of the blame for letting the students abuse us,' she added.Armah denies running after Child A, shouting at her and pushing her against the wall. If the panel finds her fitness to practice is impaired by reason of misconduct she could be struck off. The hearing continues.","Theodorah Armah lost her temper after the 'volatile' schoolgirl swore at her, a hearing was told .

Mitt Romney is winning the White House race among Americans who have already voted, according to a new poll released last night. The Republican challenger has opened up a seven point lead among the 15 per cent who have cast their votes early. Pollster Gallup says Mr Romney has more ballots in the bank than President Obama by a margin of 52 per cent to 45 per cent. Early lead: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney campaigning at Avon Lake High School . As many as a third of Americans are likely to go to the polls before Election Day on November 6. Gallup still has the two candidates in a dead heat at 49 per cent among likely voters as the race enters its final week. With Hurricane Sandy throwing both men’s campaigns into chaos, the early voters could prove to be even more crucial in the final outcome than in previous years. Mr Obama and Mr Romney both called off rallies yesterday as the storm bore down on America’s East Coast. The president cancelled a planned . appearance in Orlando, Florida to return to Washington and monitor the . weather crisis. He also shelved a trip to Green Bay, Wisconsin scheduled . for Tuesday. Mr Obama received a briefing from his top emergency advisers, his second in as . many days. He addressed reporters at the White House, warning that . recovery from the giant storm would not be swift. Obama expressed concern over the storm's effect on the economy, and the . disruptions in New York's financial district were bound to be among . those that preoccupied the administration Tuesday. It's insignificant: President Barack Obama says he is not worried about the election and it will 'take care of itself' Storm damage was projected at $10billion to $20billion, making it one of the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history. Mr Romney . followed suit, pulling out of all campaigning yesterday evening and . throughout Tuesday, along with his running mate Paul Ryan. Damage from the storm is projected at around £12billion and Mr Obama has declared it a 'major disaster'. But neither rival could afford to . totally shut down operations. The political barbs continued in campaign . ads and between aides trying to show the upper hand in a race as tight . as ever. At a White House . press conference on Monday Mr Obama dismissed a question about how the . hurricane will affect the election, saying: 'I'm not worried about the . impact on the election. The election will take care of itself of itself . next week.' At a campaign . event in Iowa, Michelle Obama said of her husband: 'He has made this . storm his priority, and he is going to do whatever it takes to make sure . the American people are safe and secure.' Lessons from history: A graphic displaying how the individual states tend to cast their vote . Republican Virginia Governor Bob . McDonnell said his state plans to extend early voting hours and restore . power quickly to election facilities in the event of outages. Officials in neighboring Maryland said early voting stations were closed yesterday. Officials . from both campaigns said they were confident they would be able to get . their message out and drive voters to the polls over the coming days. But they recognised that, after years of obsessive planning and nearly . $2billion in campaign expenditures, the storm had introduced a . last-minute element of chaos. Unwilling to cede the mantle of . leadership to Obama, Romney spoke by phone to Richard Serino, deputy . administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Addressing supporters in Iowa on Monday, he cautioned, like Obama, that the damage would likely be significant. Priority: First lady Michelle Obama told people her husband's primary concern was the safety of the American people . In the competition for attention, however, Obama held a clear edge. His pronouncements in advance of the storm dominated television coverage Monday as he told the nation, ""It's going to be a difficult storm. 'The great thing about America is when we go through tough times like this, we all pull together.'But Obama could bear the responsibility for any missteps in the government response to the storm. Obama advisers said they had learned from President George W. Bush's widely criticized response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Bush was seen as ineffective and out of touch, and his presidency never recovered. Aides at Romney's campaign headquarters planned to scale back criticism of Obama to avoid the perception that Romney was putting politics ahead of public safety. 'There's certain things we can't control and nature is one of them. We try to focus on the things that we can control,' said Romney adviser Kevin Madden. There is some evidence that natural disasters can hurt an incumbent's re-election chances as voters often blame whoever is in office for adversity.

Jaguar today dispelled the myth that cats don’t like water – by designing a speedboat to go with its latest car. It unveiled the prototype craft to showcase the towing ability of its new Jaguar XF Sportbrake estate which hit the road today and will arrive in showrooms and driveways from late November. Jaguar design director Ian Callum explained: 'The Concept Speedboat by Jaguar Cars’ showcases the design DNA of the British premium luxury and sports car manufacturer in an unexpected and spectacular package. Concept: Jaguar has designed a speedboat to showcase the towing ability of its new Sportbrake estate . Luxury: The fibreglass hull is finished with teak decking in classic nautical style . ‘We recognise that both our existing and future customers enjoy diverse and active lifestyles. With the launch of the new Jaguar XF Sportbrake, we had an opportunity to create a vision of how our design philosophy might be applied to an alternative product, in which speed and beauty are also priorities. ‘It looks powerful. It follows, in so many ways, the idea of a traditional speedboat but with the sleek and fast characteristics that you would expect from a Jaguar car.’ To create the sleek speedboat, Jaguar consulted with specialists Ivan Erdevicki Naval Architecture & Yacht Design Inc, and Seventy Seven Design . The Jaguar Speedboat has a gel coat . fibreglass hull topped with teak decking. This is split by a carbon . fibre fin, inspired by the  legendary Jaguar D-Type. Demand: The work put into the boat suggests Jaguar may consider putting the prototype into production . Design philosophy: Both the car and the boat are aimed at customers with 'active lifestyles' Iconic: The fin behind the boat's cockpit evokes memories of Jaguar's classic D-Type car . Mr Callum said: ’The front of the boat flows seamlessly into the screen and the red 2+1 cabin follows the sporting character of Jaguar cars. ‘ . Jaguar’s automotive heritage is also subtly recognised with fuel filler caps inspired by the first generation of the XJ saloon.  A polished aluminium propeller and pop-up mooring post show how the boat could be powered and docked respectively. Although officially spoken of as a ‘styling exercise’, the degree of work put into the project suggests that Jaguar could be persuaded to build the craft if demand for it is sufficient.

A senior columnist at the New York Times has openly questioned whether former BBC boss Mark Thompson is fit for his new post running America’s most prestigious newspaper in the wake of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal. Mr Thompson has denied knowledge of a BBC cover-up and vowed to take up his role in New York as planned next month. But in a column, Joe Nocera questioned his explanation of his role in the affair: ‘Thompson winds up appearing wilfully ignorant, and it makes you wonder what kind of an organisation the BBC was when he was running it. It also makes you wonder what kind of chief executive he’d be at the Times.’ Denial: Mark Thompson, left, has denied any knowledge of a BBC cover up over Jimmy Savile, right, and vowed to take up his new job in New York as planned on November 12 . ‘Thompson winds up appearing willfully ignorant, and it makes you wonder what kind of an organization the BBC was when Thompson was running it — and what kind of leader he was. It also makes you wonder what kind of chief executive he’d be at The Times,’ wrote Mr Nocera. It comes as day after it was alleged that Mr Thompson's office was twice alerted to claims that Savile was a child abuser. In May and again in September, his aides were told of allegations that the late television presenter had molested youngsters on BBC premises. But on both occasions, a spokesman for the ex-director general insisted, the claims were not passed on to him. Claims: Mark Thompson with a former colleague. Mr Nocera said Thompson appears 'willfully ignorant' Mr Nocera, a business and finance columnist writing for the flagship paper’s Op-Ed page, said Mr Thompson’s nameplate is already on his office door. ‘Yet since early October,’ he added, ‘all anybody has asked about Thompson are those two most damning of questions: what did he know, and when did he know it?’ Mr Nocera said the BBC ‘plainly’ did cover up Savile’s wrongdoing. ‘What is far less certain is how high the cover-up went,’ he continued. ‘Thompson first said that he never heard the rumors about Savile, and that he didn’t learn about the “Newsnight” programme until after it was cancelled. Given the byzantine nature of the BBC bureaucracy, these are plausible denials. BBC Television Centre, Wood Lane, London. Mr Nocera said the BBC ‘plainly’ did cover up Savile’s wrongdoing . ‘Here is where it gets a little less plausible. Thompson now says that at a cocktail party last December, a BBC reporter said to him, “You must be worried about the ‘Newsnight’ investigation into Jimmy Savile.” Soon thereafter, Thompson asked his underlings about the investigation and was told that it had been killed — for journalistic reasons. He claims to have inquired no further, not even to ask what the investigation was about. ‘A few months later, the news broke in the British press that the BBC had, as The Daily Mail put it in a headline, “shelved Jimmy Savile sex abuse investigation ‘to protect its own reputation.’ ” ‘Given the seriousness of sexual abuse allegations — look at what it did to Penn State — you would think that Thompson and his underlings would immediately want to get to the bottom of it. But, again, they did nothing.’ Mr Thompson, 55, has made it clear he has the full support of his new bosses. Jimmy Savile pictured at the Liberal Party Conference in Scarborough in 1965 . ‘I do not believe there is anything that I've done in relation to this matter which should in anyway impinge on my abilities to fully discharge the responsibilities I'll have at the New York Times,’ he insisted in an interview last week. But the columnist claimed that New York Times chairman and publisher Arthur Sulzberger is ‘in a difficult spot.’ ‘He believes strongly that he’s got the executive he needs to lead The Times to the promised land of healthy profits again,’ he wrote. ‘Although he declined to be interviewed for this column, he appears to have accepted Thompson’s insistence that he knew nothing about the explosive allegations that became public literally 50 days after he accepted the Times job. Sulzberger is backing his man unreservedly. ‘For the sake of Times employees — not to mention the readers who want to see a vibrant New York Times Company — let’s hope his faith in Thompson is warranted. ‘Otherwise, the BBC won’t be the only organization being asked tough questions about its judgment.’","Mr Thompson has denied any knowledge of a BBC cover up and vowed to take up his new job in New York as planned on November 12 .

A three-year-old boy with cancer is in a race against time to start vital treatment in the U.S. before Christmas. Braiden-Lee Prescott and his family, from Leigh, Greater Manchester, need to raise £250,000 within two months to give the youngster the best chance of survival. He was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma in February and has had radiotherapy, chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant at the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital. Fighting for survival: Braiden-Lee Prescott was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma in February . Brave boy: The youngster has already had chemotherapy, radiotherapy and a bone marrow transplant in Manchester . Now he needs to go abroad to access a crucial treatment that could stimulate his immune system and prevent a relapse, because it is not available in the UK. To add to the family's problems, Braiden needs to have the pricey therapy by the beginning of December - within 100 days of a bone marrow operation he had in August. Well-wishers have rallied to raise £57,000 so far, but the deadline is looming. The boy's father Wayne, 34, full-time mother Stef, 21, and little brother Tyler hope to spend six months in Philadelphia while he completes the treatment. Mr Prescott, a former mechanic who now cares full time for his son, said: 'I find it hard to put into words how devastated we were by the diagnosis of neuroblastoma, but we’ve done our best to pick ourselves up and be strong for our little man. Braiden-Lee is having frontline neuroblastoma treatment now and is doing so well - he’s still smiling! Our inspiration: His parents Wayne and Stef are desperate to get the boy treatment that will prevent a relapse - if he has it within 100 days of his bone marrow transplant . 'Happy and cheeky': Braiden's family noticed something was wrong when he suddenly developed a limp and a temperature in February . 'He’s our inspiration, a very special little boy and he is a true fighter. We would do anything to get our boy the treatment he deserves and ask everyone to do what they can to help us get to America.' The family hope Braiden will get Children’s Oncology Group neuroblastoma treatment, which will improve his chances of beating the disease by 25 per cent. This treatment will help stimulate Braiden’s body to recognise and attack the neuroblastoma if it was to return, which is always a worry with this deadly disease, where relapse rates are high. Braiden was diagnosed after he started limping. Doctors thought at first it was septic arthritis, and transferred him to Manchester Children’s Hospital, but even after an operation, his problem persisted. Eventually, after a bone marrow biopsy, they realised he had childhood cancer stage 4 neuroblastoma. Hope for the future: The U.S. treatment could improve Braiden's chance of survival by 25 per cent . Determination: There is always a worry of relapse with this deadly disease, so Braiden's family want to see his immune system restored . Grandfather Paul Reece said Braiden is a normal, happy and cheeky boy, but suddenly developed a limp one day in February 2012. 'We kept our eye on Braiden and over the next three days he was still limping,'  he said. 'He also developed a temperature. 'We took him to the doctors, then to Leigh walk-in centre and he was sent to Wigan Infirmary where they ran tests and transferred him to Manchester Children’s Hospital. 'They thought it was septic arthritis and he underwent an operation, then later scans and a biopsy revealed he had cancer.

Police estimate the woman’s body had been in the water for up to 10 days before spotted by a tourist near the base of the Falls before traveling near the Rainbow Bridge and removed by police on Wednesday afternoon. Police said the latest case is not related to body parts found in Toronto earlier in August that are connected to a victim whose torso is still missing. Floating: Police are on the hunt for a murderer after a torso belonging to a woman was found floating in the water near Niagara Falls on Wednesday . The murder victims have gotten extra attention because of the case of porn actor Luka Magnotta, who is accused of dismembering a Chinese student in Montreal and mailing his body parts to political parties and a school earlier this year. Niagara Police Insp. Jim McCaffrey said the woman was a murder victim, but declined to reveal the cause of death. McCaffrey said authorities have asked police in New York and Ontario to review missing-person files. Police say they are asking for help in identifying the body. A preliminary post-mortem indicated the torso belonged to a white woman between 20 and 40 years old and had a pierced navel and at least one cesarean section scar, the examination indicated. McCaffrey said it's not uncommon to find body parts in the Niagara River. 'That's pretty fast moving water and it does have an effect on bodies in the water,' he said. Spotting: The woman's body was spotted by a tourist floating near the base of the Falls before moving near the Rainbow Bridge, pictured left, and removed by police . An emergency task unit, marine unit and the Niagara Parks Police high angle river team were being called on to search for the rest of the woman's remains, McCaffery said. Niagara Police Const. Derek Watson said the search will not be easy. 'Given the unpredictable current and the bodies of water that flow into the Niagara River, it makes it impossible to even know where to start,' Watson said. Police said the body is not connected to the recent murder of a 41-year-old woman whose body parts were strewn in two different parts of the Toronto area. Her torso is still missing. Guang Hua Liu head, foot and hands were discovered in a river west of Toronto earlier in mid-August. A few days later, her two calves, a thigh and an arm were found in a creek in eastern Toronto.

The Met Office issued a rare near-nationwide weather alert for Monday and said there were no areas that could be ruled out. The warning comes as the remains of Hurricane Katia, which whipped up 22ft waves off the U.S. east coast, move across the Atlantic today. By the time Katia reaches the UK, the winds will be just below tropical storm force – the same level as those that hit New York last month.

He is understood to have become depressed after the breakdown of his five-year relationship and legal issues surrounding some of his children, aged 11 to 24, from one of his two previous marriages. Four weeks ago, he moved out of the flat he shared with his 48-year-old wife, who also had two children from a previous relationship, in the resort of Ryde to a terraced house in Sandown with his daughter aged 12. A neighbour said Mrs Charles had suffered mental health problems, and had tried to commit suicide on more than one occasion. The couple were seen sitting in a Renault Scenic in a National Trust car park at Culver Down on Wednesday evening.

His controversial comments came ahead of a . government-commissioned report to be unveiled next Monday on proposals . to boost the flagging industrial competitiveness of Europe's second . largest economy.

French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault . has suggested the 35-hour working week is not sacrosanct and said the . nation needs to be re-started to 'fire on all cylinders' The 35-hour working week was first adopted in France in February 2000 under Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's Plural Left government. The previous legal duraction of the working week was 39 hours, established by François Mitterrand. The 35 hours is the legal standard limit, after which further working time was to be considered overtime. The aim was to reduce unemployment and stop some people working long hours while others were unemployed. It was also aimed at giving workers more time to enjoy their lives. The law has always rankled with the right but when Nicolas Sarkozy came to power in 2007 he was content to tinker with the legislation rather than scrap it.

Ayrault, whose five-month-old . government has been criticised for a string of communications gaffes, . clarified his remarks after business and union leaders seized on . them as signalling a major policy shift. 'I . said nothing was taboo. But this is simply not a cause the government . advocates. There will be no rolling back on the 35-hour week because it . is not the cause of our difficulties,' he told French radio. Laurence .

The . gradual introduction of the shorter working week was intended as a . socially progressive move and to encourage employers to hire more staff . by making higher overtime costs kick in after an employee had worked 35 . hours in a given week. Nicolas . Sarkozy, the conservative president unseated in May by Socialist . Francois Hollande, offered overtime tax breaks to lessen the impact of . the measure but did not try to repeal it.

Dr Metin Eren flintknapping stone tools: The researchers say that it's unlikely our evolutionary predecessors shaped tools by accident - and instead shaped flint to be hard-wearing and have a good centre of gravity . Researchers at the University of Kent have recreated the processes Neanderthals used to produce sharp flint axes, and found that our ancestors were skilled engineers. A modern-day 'flintknapper' replicated the sharpening processes that Neanderthals used to create tools - a sort of modern 'reverse engineering' of ancient techniques in use by three kinds of early 'hominin' including Neanderthals as early as 300,000 years ago. The researchers found that Neanderthals could shape 'elegant' stone tools - shaping them to be hard-wearing, easily sharpened and with a perfectly balanced centre of gravity. The reproduction of how Neanderthals worked shows that it is unlikely that stone flakes used in the tools could have been shaped  by accident - and that our ancestors intentionally 'engineered' stone cores to create tools fit for their jobs. Dr Metin Eren, Leverhulme Early Career . Fellow at the University’s School of Anthropology and Conservation and . the flintknapper who crafted the tools, said: ‘The more we learn about . the stone tool-making of the Neanderthals and their contemporaries, the . more elegant it becomes. 'The sophistication evident in their tool-making . suggests cognitive abilities more similar to our own than not.’ The researchers say that our ancestors 'designed' tools to be hard-wearing, easily sharpenable and have a centre of gravity that meant they were easily usable. Dr Stephen Lycett, Senior Lecturer in . Human Evolution and the researcher who conducted the laboratory . analysis of the tools, commented: ‘Mobility is a factor in the lives of . all hunter-gatherer populations, including Late Pleistocene hominins. 'Since mobile hunter-gatherers can . only carry a fixed number of tools, it is paramount that the potential . usefulness of their tools is optimised relative to their weight. 'The new analyses indicated that . Levallois flakes appear to be particularly  in a variety of ways . relative to other flakes. These flakes are on average thicker across . their surface area, and more uniformly thick. These . properties would have optimised durability.' 'The symmetry and evenly distributed . thickness of Levallois flakes would also align the tool’s centre of mass . with the tool’s motion during use, making them ergonomically . desirable.’ Three types of prehistoric hominin -including Neanderthals - could produce the flakes, which were manufactured across Euroepe, Western Asia and Africa as early as 300,000 years ago. Replicas of the rocks that Neanderthals used to shape their tools - which the researchers say was a conscious process of engineering . Researchers have thought that our ancestors might have intentionally sought out the flakes for their size and shape. But it was regarded as controversial, and recently researchers questioned whether Levallois tool production involved conscious, structured planning. Now, the experimental study – in which a modern-day flintknapper replicated hundreds of Levallois artifacts – supports the notion that Levallois flakes were indeed engineered. By combining experimental archaeology with morphometrics (the study of form) and statistical analysis, the Kent researchers have proved for the first time that flakes removed from 'prepared' cores were more standard than ones created by accident. Importantly, they also identified the specific properties of Levallois flakes that would have made them preferable to past mobile hunter-gathering peoples. Dr Lycett also explained that ‘amongst a variety of choices these tools are ‘superflakes’. They are not so thin that they are ineffective but they are not so thick that they could not be re-sharpened effectively or be unduly heavy to carry, which would have been important to hominins such as the Neanderthals’.","'Flintknapper' recreates techniques used as early as 300,000 years ago .

"By . Mail Foreign Service . UPDATED: . 05:50 EST, 10 August 2011 . The world’s media reacted with shock and horror to the riots that have swept Britain, with London portrayed as ‘a lawless city’. The story made front pages around the globe, and was among the top items on TV news shows in dozens of countries. Germany led the way, with Der Spiegel magazine comparing London to the capital of Somalia. Burning down: Several foreign governments have started issuing advice to their citizens thinking about visiting the UK . Embarrassing: The Portuguese Jornal de Noticias (left) and the Belgian De Standaard (right) both put photographs of the London riots on their front pages . ‘The television images dominating screens this week could be right out of Mogadishu,’ it wrote. ‘As difficult to imagine as it might be, the pictures aren’t from Somalia, but from London, right in  the centre of Europe. And they will never be forgotten.’ In newspapers, TZ in Munich asked: ‘What has gone wrong with Britain? Like the Sex Pistols said, it truly is anarchy in the UK.’ The tabloid Bild summed up the feelings of many with the headline: ‘Chaos reigns in London!’ On its website, other stories were titled ‘England in flames’ and ‘London’s night of horror’. Many looked ahead to next summer, with the respected Süddeutsche Zeitung warning that ‘fears are concentrated on the Olympics’. Countries including Canada and Australia were left stunned that the kind of unrest seen in Greece and France had befallen Britain. Headline news: Dutch newspaper Het Parool (left) and the Argentinian paper Clarín (right) both led on the London riots . In the U.S., cars burning across the English capital featured prominently even as Washington and Wall Street struggled amid the  debt crisis. The New York Times called the riots ‘the worst outbreak of social unrest in Britain in 25 years’. Online, the Huffington Post news website ran the headline ‘London’s Burning’ while one contributor to the venerable Wall Street Journal wrote: ‘These people are welcome to march and protest, but when they start robbing and destroying others’ property then I’m all for declaring them targets for target practice.’ An editorial in Le Monde, one of France’s leading newspapers, said the UK was asking itself: ‘How to put an end to the destruction, which has in three days devastated whole neighbourhoods in London and its suburbs, as well as the cities of Birmingham, Bristol and Liverpool?’ The riots also led every TV bulletin  in Spain, with laSexta describing ‘a  lawless city’. Foreign news: Spanish newspaper El País (left) and Austrian newspaper Voralberger Nachrichten (right) have both published in-depth coverage of the riots . The Coalition Government’s response came . in for criticism as well, following the belated decisions of senior . politicians – including Prime Minister David Cameron – to return from . their holidays. Yesterday, it was announced that Parliament would be recalled tomorrow from its summer recess. The Spanish newspaper El País said: ‘Far from reacting quickly, the Government was missing during the crucial hours and has responded with a vagueness which has failed to calm  the violence. Cameron’s credibility  has suffered a new reverse in these  days of fury.’ El Mundo blamed the riots on an unintegrated immigrant population living  in poverty. Warning: The editor of India's Lonely Planet magazine Vardhan Kondvikar told his Twitter followers to avoid coming to the UK at all . It said: ‘That is why the British authorities – in fact, you could say all of . Europe – should bend over backwards to stop these violent outbreaks . which, if they get worse, would have unforeseeable consequences.’ Demonstrating the extent of the devastation, newspapers in Syria compared  the situation to trouble within its  own borders.","Germans warned to exercise 'special caution'

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 16:54 EST, 29 October 2012 . The mother of a murdered nine-year-old girl has sued a mental health clinic saying it was in a position to know and prevent the violent tendencies of the teenager who killed her daughter. Patricia Preiss filed the wrongful death lawsuit against Pathways Behavioral Healthcare, two employees and 18-year-old Alyssa Bustamante, who was convicted in Elizabeth Olten's death. Bustamante was 15 at the time of the October 2009 slaying in St. Martins, Missouri - a small community just west of Jefferson City. She was sentenced in February to life in prison with the possibility of parole after pleading guilty to killing Elizabeth. Alyssa Bustamante (left), then 15, told . authorities she had strangled, stabbed and buried her nine-year-old . neighbor Elizabeth Olten (right) because she wanted to know what it felt . like to kill . During Bustamante's sentencing . hearing in February, Cole County prosecutors and the teenager's public . defenders presented evidence that Bustamante had cut herself a number of . times and had been hospitalized at the Mid-Missouri Mental Health . Center in Columbia after a 2007 suicide attempt. She became a Pathways . client after she was released from the hospital. Bustamante . admitted in court that she strangled Elizabeth, stabbed her and slit . her throat, then buried the child in a wooded area behind their homes. During . the hearing, prosecutors pointed to a journal entry written by . Bustamante on the night of the slaying in which she described it as an . 'ahmazing' experience. In court, Bustamante apologized for her actions. The lawsuit by Preiss alleges that Bustamante had indicated to Pathways personnel that she wanted to harm Elizabeth. Pathways' employees 'were aware of . the same violent propensities of Bustamante, as well as the specific, . identifiable threats to harm Olten,' the lawsuit says. But 'none of these defendants took actions to detain Bustamante' and . 'none warned Olten or Preiss of the specific threat on Olten, nor did . they take any action that might have prevented Bustamante from harming . Olten.' Life behind bars: Eighteen-year-old Alyssa Bustamante is escorted out of the Cole County Courthouse in February after she was handed down a life sentence . Pathways counselor Ron Wilson, who . was named as a defendant in the lawsuit, had testified during . Bustamante's sentencing hearing that she had not indicated she was a . threat to anyone but herself. The lawsuit also names Pathways . psychiatrist Niger Sultana as a defendant. Mel Fetter, president and CEO of Pathways' parent company Compass Health, refused to comment on pending litigation. The . lawsuit, which was filed October 18, was assigned to Cole County . Circuit Judge Patricia Joyce, who also presided over Bustamante's . sentencing hearing. No hearings had been scheduled as of Monday. Ms Preiss previously filed a separate . wrongful death lawsuit against Karen and Gary Brooke, who are . Bustamante's grandparents and were her legal guardians at the time of . Elizabeth's slaying. St. Louis County Circuit Judge Gloria Reno ordered a $400,000 judgment in that case, after an October 3 hearing. Prior . to receiving her life sentence in February, Bustamante said to the family of her . victim: 'If I could give my life to bring her back, I would. I just want . to say I'm sorry for what happened. I'm so sorry.' Morbid fascination: Bustamante previously attempted . suicide and was a cutter. Defense attorneys highlighted her troubled childhood as part of their argument about why she . should receive leniency . Elizabeth's . family members wept as Alyssa made her statement prior to the sentence . being handed down by Cole County Presiding Judge Patricia Joyce. The . teenager's defense attorneys had argued for a sentence less than life . in prison, saying Bustamante's use of the antidepressant Prozac had made . her more prone to violence. They said she had suffered from depression for years and once attempted suicide by overdosing on painkillers. But prosecutors sought a longer sentence, describing the 18-year-old as a thrill killer who lacked remorse. They . noted that Bustamante had dug two graves several days in advance, and . that on the evening of the killing had sent her younger sister to lure . Elizabeth outside with an invitation to play. Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt . David Rice testified that the teenager told him 'she wanted to know what . it felt like' to kill someone. The trial's conclusion follows days of testimony in a small courtroom in Missouri's capital city. Proceedings . descended into chaos during the trial as prosecutor Mark Richardson made an . impassioned request for a lifelong sentence for Bustamante. Her . grandmother and grandfather stormed out of the courtroom, prompting . Bustamante — who had been staring blankly downward as Richardson . recounted her crime — to begin silently crying for the first time in her . court proceedings that have spanned more than two years. As the judge sentenced Bustamante, Elizabeth's grandmother interrupted and cried . out from her wheelchair. 'I . think Alyssa should get out of jail the same day Elizabeth gets out of . the grave!' declared the grandmother, whom a prosecutor later identified . as Sandy Corn. The emotional, two-day sentencing hearing highlighted by . repeated references to words Bustamante had written in her diary on the . night she strangled, slit the throat and repeatedly stabbed Elizabeth. Bustamante, . then 15, wrote that it was an 'ahmazing' and 'pretty enjoyable' experience, ending the entry by saying: 'I gotta go to church . now...lol.' 'The motive . has to be the most senseless, reprehensible that could be in humankind, . and that is to take a life for a thrill,' Richardson said. Bustamante's . attorney, Donald Catlett, cited the testimony on Tuesday of mental . health professionals who described Bustamante as a 'psychologically . damaged' and 'severely emotionally disturbed' child. They . recounted her family's history with drug abuse, mental disorders and . suicide attempts, noting her father was in prison and her mother had . abandoned her. Her mother was in the courtroom on Tuesday for the first . time. Various mental . health professionals testified over the course of the two-day hearing . that Bustamante suffers from major depression and displays the features . of a borderline personality disorder. Some also said she shows early signs of a bipolar disorder. Bustamante . began taking the antidepressant drug Prozac after a suicide attempt on . Labor Day 2007 at the start of her eighth grade year. Her . dosage of the medication had been increased just two weeks before she . murdered Elizabeth. Bustamante's attorneys presented evidence from a . psychiatrist who testified that Prozac could have been a 'major . contributing factor' in the slaying — a theory rejected by a prosecution . psychiatrist who insisted there was no scientific evidence of Prozac . causing homicides, or even increasing aggression.","Patricia Preiss sued Pathways Behavioral Healthcare and two employees .

Gay footballers should be encouraged to come ‘out’ as an example to the rest of society, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt said yesterday. Mr Hunt said football was a powerful weapon in the fight against homophobia as the sport reaches members of the public that politicians cannot. He pointed out there were no openly gay footballers in Premier League clubs and said it would send an ‘incredibly strong signal’ if football showed a more tolerant attitude. His comments came as the Prime Minister hosted a summit aimed at stamping out racism and homophobia in football. Mr Cameron said swift action was needed to ‘crush’ any return of racism in the sport following recent high-profile cases involving top players. Earlier this month Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was forced to apologise for refusing to shake hands with Manchester United’s Patrice Evra before a game. He had just returned from an eight-match ban for racially abusing Evra. Discrimination claims: David Cameron and John .

Offensive: ITV reporter Richard Pallot twice referred to black footballers as 'coloured' He said: ‘Obviously it’s pretty . unlikely there aren’t any gay players, we don’t know, but it would be an . incredibly strong signal if we could have a more tolerant attitude in . terms of what it would say to the rest of society.’ Mr Hunt said he had given the FA two months to come up with a plan to tackle homophobic and racist issues. He . added: ‘Where football decides to do something they have a huge cut . through to parts of the population that are never going to listen to . people like me.’ However last night ITV News was forced to apologise after one of its journalists used the term ‘coloured’ while reporting on the No.10 summit. A spokesman said: ‘We regret any offence.’ Yesterday’s summit, which included former England stars John Barnes and Graeme Le Saux, was the 17th time since October 2010 that Mr Cameron has invited celebrities to Downing Street. They include Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button launching a road safety campaign and actor Kevin Spacey being presented with a Big Society award.","Jeremy Hunt says football could send 'strong signal' by showing more tolerance towards homosexuality .

"An inquest heard father-of-four known as 'Big George' suffered a cardiac arrest at his home . By . Andrew Levy . UPDATED: . 05:55 EST, 11 August 2011 . The composer behind popular TV theme tunes including Have I Got News For You and The Office died of a heart attack after taking the illegal party drug known as Meow Meow, an inquest has heard. George Webley, 53, who was also an award-winning radio presenter, was found struggling for breath at his home by his wife. The father-of-four, known by fans as ‘Big George’, suffered a massive heart attack and was pronounced dead when paramedics arrived. Larger than life: BBC presenter George Webley died after taking illegal drug Meow Meow . The class-C drug was outlawed in April last year after it was linked with a series of deaths. Milton Keynes Coroner Thomas Osborne . recorded a verdict of death by misadventure yesterday, saying: ‘The . verdict should be that Mr Webley suffered quite severe heart disease. ‘Because of the cathinones found in . his blood - these designer drugs - and his previous illness, it’s more . likely than not that the final event was caused by the drugs in his . system. ‘It is wrong to record natural . causes. The verdict is he died as a result of misadventure. He was . taking the drugs not for taking his own life but this was an action that . went wrong and led to his heart attack and subsequent death.’ Big George: A verdict of misadventure was recorded at an inquest on Monday . Mr Webley was found collapsed by his wife, Sheila, on May 7. She opened the back door to give him some fresh air before calling for an ambulance but he was dead by the time help arrived. The grandfather-of-three was a . proficient guitarist and pianist as a teenager who played in bands . before moving into the London recording session scene. During this . period he worked on dozens of advertising jingles. In 1989 he became musical director for Jameson Tonight, a daily chat show on Sky hosted by Derek Jameson. But in the 1990s he became a leading . composer and arranger of television theme tunes. Other well-known . jingles included those for The Office and Room 101. He once wrote that ‘if passports . still stated occupation, mine would say “composer of music with an . average duration of 29 seconds”’. Mr Webley also began a radio career . in the mid-1990s and in 2002 won a gold Sony Award for best music . presenter for his show on BBC Three Counties Radio, which covers . Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. In 2006 he moved to BBC London 94.9, hosting a popular late night show. He also appeared on television as a music expert for Graham Norton’s Eurovision programmes and BBC education series Music File. Mrs Webley was unavailable to comment yesterday. A statement on the family website after his death said: ‘Our hearts go out to all those who share our loss.’ Meow Meow: Class B drug Mephodrone has been blamed for a string of deaths across Britain and was banned in April . BBC London 94.9 editor David Robery . paid tribute at the time, saying: ‘Big George lived up to his name in . every sense. He will be terribly missed. ‘He was a larger than life character with a radio personality to match.’ Mephedrone was barely known three . years ago but is now as popular as cocaine among 16 to 24-year-olds, the .

This is the face of the mystery man who confronted a gang of rioting yobs but was  battered to almost death and left on a life-support machine. Richard Mannington Bowes, 68, is currently in a coma after he tried to stamp out the fire which thugs started in a supermarket bin in Ealing, West London. He remains in a critical condition in hospital today after suffering serious head injuries on Monday night on Monday evening. Speaking from the scene of the attack, Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane said he has been unable to contact the victim's family and appealed to the assailant to turn himself in. Attacked: Richard Mannington Bowes, 68, (left) was critically injured after the riots in Ealing. Right, the suspect that police are hunting in connection with the attack . The victim, whose identity was . established only when locals recognised his description and officers . used his keys to enter his house, remains critical on a life support . machine. Mr McFarlane said the investigation could turn into a murder inquiry. The . detective described the scenes surrounding the attack. He said a . handful of officers, not wearing protective gear, arrived at 10.45pm to . reports of looting at the Arcadia shopping centre. The . half dozen officers were massively outnumbered by scores of thugs and . called for back-up as they were showered with missiles, including . bottles. 'There was some suggestion he was attacked because he was stamping out fires that had been started,' said Mr McFarlane. 'An officer saw Mr Bowes being knocked over and attacked and they called for assistance. Officers arrived and they were able to drive the mob off.' The injured 68-year-old was then taken to hospital. Mr McFarlane said the attackers 'clearly did not like what he did or said'. Mr Bowes was found without a wallet or phone so officers faced an uphill struggle to identify him. Help: Richard Mannington Bowes, left, is assisted by Peter Firstbrook and a police officer during the riots in Ealing . Horrific: Mr Mannington Bowes lies injured on the floor and fire rages around him after attempting to put out the flames lit by rioters . Concern: A police officer and another man come to the victim's aid in one of the most horrifying pictures to emerge from the rioting . Mr McFarlane said the victim, who is . originally from Bournemouth, 'clearly kept himself to himself and . appears to be a very private man'. 'I am desperate to get in touch with any of his family,' the officer said. He added that police have footage of the incident. A man who stepped in to save a . battered man who has set upon by youths in Ealing has told how he . dragged the victim away from a raging fire. Peter Firstbrook, 60, knelt with the . Richard Mannington Bowes and bravely ushered away the feral youths who . rampaged through Ealing on Monday night. Father-of four Mr Firstbrook dragged the Mr Mannington Bowes' body away from the fire as it quickly engulfed his leg. Mr Mannington Bowes' is currently in a coma after he tried to stamp out the fire which thugs started in a supermarket bin. Mr . Firstbrook said: 'There were about 120 youths. One of them, a big black . lad in his early twenties, approached me and said something along the . lines of: 'There's one of your lot over there and he's injured.' The documentary film-maker said that the man was beyond the rioters and so he knew he had to push past them. Suspect: Police have released this CCTV image of the man they want to talk to over the attack . 'When I saw him, I realised the man's leg was almost in the fire so I tried to drag him to safety,' he told the Telegraph. 'I . couldn't move him so I got three young lads from the crowd. They also . seemed quite concerned and helped me drag him to an alleyway. Then they . disappeared. 'I checked his pulse and his airways and tried to talk to him, but he was unconscious and had blood coming from his ear.' Mr Firstbrook said that Mr Mannington Bowes had no visible external injuries which lead him to believe that his wounds were internal. Police have now identified the man. His phone and wallet were stolen in the attack and it is believed that he lived alone. He is now in a critical condition in hospital after suffering serious head injuries during the attack. Officers from Scotland Yard are currently trying to trace his next of kin. Mr Mannington Bowes was attacked at about 10.45pm after remonstrating with teenagers who were setting fire to two industrial bins outside a shopping centre. Police officers who tried to aid the Mr Mannington Bowes were then pelted with missiles including bottles and bricks. Riot squad officers who rushed to the scene had to push back the mob to reach the injured man while being attacked. A line of officers then held back the yobs as paramedics arrived. Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane said: 'I need the assistance of the community who may have witnessed the attack on this innocent man, to come forward and provide information or images they may have recorded on mobile devices. 'This information could be crucial in bringing those responsible for this terrible crime to justice.' He said the victim was 'violently assaulted and knocked to the ground' as he tried to extinguish the fire, and added: 'Police officers who were under attack by the mob drove them away and pulled the victim to relative safety and rendered first aid with the assistance of members of the public in an attempt to save his life. 'Again I urge these people to speak to us as they may have valuable information.' Aftermath: A burnt out car sits next to Ealing Green following the night of riots, and right, a cone is stuck in a a damaged window at the Arcadia shopping . Clean up: A shop owner sifts through stock that was damaged during the riots in Ealing . Police have also released CCTV footage of a man suspected of carrying out the attack. The . suspect, a black man with a big build, is seen wearing a white t-shirt . with writing on the front and a dark-coloured jumper over his shoulders . in the images. Mr Mannington Bowes attacker is believed to have earlier looted a supermarket in the affluent west London suburb. Detective . Chief Inspector McFarlane said: 'Through CCTV we have identified a . strong suspect. I know that on seeing these images of him people will be . able to identify him. 'If you know who this man is please contact my incident room. If you are this man in the CCTV, do the decent thing and give yourself up.' The aftermath of the attack was caught on camera as the man, in a checked shirt and apparently wearing glasses, lies face down on the ground. A resident has also described how he helped put out fires after the man was attacked by rioters. Tom Wakeley, 31, said he and his neighbours ran out of their flats in Ealing with fire extinguishers and bottles of water to help douse the flames in wheelie bins. Mr Wakeley said: 'I started noticing sirens at about 9pm, and there were a lot of hoodies around. From about 10pm you could guess it was going to kick off, there were a lot of them walking around and it was getting a bit sinister.'","Critically injured 68-year-old man named as Richard Mannington Bowes .

"By . Emily Allen . UPDATED: . 02:59 EST, 29 February 2012 . Lib Dem MP Simon Hughes said the police were guilty of an 'unforgivable' and a 'completely unacceptable failure' by not probing the full extent of News of the World payments to private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. Speaking at the Leveson Inquiry this morning, the deputy Lib Dem leader said the 2006 police investigation failed to look into whether it was 'appropriate to bring charges against other people' despite evidence that 'at least three' other senior News of the World journalists were involved in hacking his phone. The MP, outed by the Sun after the paper said it had proof he used a gay chat line, settled his phone-hacking claim with News International for £45,000 earlier this month. He . was named as a hacking victim in the 2007 trial of News of the World . royal editor Clive Goodman and Mulcaire, who were both jailed after . admitting to intercepting voicemail messages left on royal aides' phones. Simon Hughes, pictured at the Leveson Inquiry this morning, settled his phone-hacking claim with News International for £45,000 earlier this month . Mr Hughes told the inquiry: 'It struck me as fairly obvious once . everything was revealed if you had seen the names of the other . journalists from the same paper (in Muclaire's files) you would at least have asked some . questions and got them in for questioning and investigate what their . role was. 'You would also have pursued Mr Mulcaire and potentially other . people and ask them what his relationship was with the other people.' Mr Hughes said now the police have 'opened the box' six years later it should 'complete the task fully'. The NOTW's private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. Mr Hughes said he wasn't shown the contents of his 'books' until last year . He said: 'If there had been robust . action in 2006 a lot of the illegal action might have been shut down and . a lot of the people who are now known to be victims might not be . victims or might not have suffered as much.' Mr Justice Leveson said there are several witnesses whose lives had been 'dramatically affected' by that delay. Mr Hughes went on: 'I am . frustrated even now that there wasn't comprehensive action taken then, . that was the window of opportunity, a lot of pain and grief could have . been spared. 'Police ... could have prosecuted those who were clearly in . the frame ... We lost three or four years in which illegal activity . continued.' Mr Hughes said he did not know until May last year exactly what information was contained in Mulcaire's notebooks. He said it included transcripts, friends' names and phone numbers, addresses, call data, and names of people he had not heard of. Mr Hughes said: 'It was clear from September 2006 at the highest level the News of the World knew about this and therefore it was in the public interest that the News of the World and their employees should be held to account.' He added: 'There was a whole range of people clearly acting in concert either directly or indirectly illegally and they were not touched. I find it impossible to find a good explanation for why that happened.' Mr Hughes told the inquiry he had some concerns about his voicemails back in 2005 and 2006 after messages that he had not listened to were marked as 'read'. He said he later received a call from the Sun newspaper who wanted to talk to him about a 'private matter'. He admitted to the newspaper he had made calls to a gay chat line and gave an interview to the which was published in January 2006. Mr Hughes told the inquiry that he went from 'odds on . favourite' to take the Lib Dem leadership from Charles Kennedy to not winning following the coverage. Mr Hughes said: 'There was . apparently a direct impact between that revelation and the consequent . press coverage and my political reputation and chance of winning the . election.' Later on today the inquiry will hear from Crimewatch presenter and former police officer Jacqui Hames, retired teacher Christopher Jefferies, who was wrongly arrested during the Joanna Yeates murder investigation, and Guardian journalist Nick Davies.","Simon Hughes gave interview to Sun about his sexuality after reporters said they knew he had phoned Man Talk chat services .
