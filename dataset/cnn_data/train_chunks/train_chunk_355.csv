"New York (CNN) -- Technological challenges would pose major obstacles to the installation of platform doors in New York's subway system, transit officials said Monday. During a transit and bus committee meeting at the Metropolitan Transit Authority headquarters, board members discussed the possibility of installing such barriers to curb the number of subway train fatalities. The discussion came in the wake of two incidents last year in which people were pushed onto the tracks and fatally struck by trains. In December, Ki-Suck Han, 58, was pushed onto the tracks in a subway station near Times Square by a 30-year-old homeless man. A few weeks later, a 31-year-old woman was charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime for pushing 46-year old Sunando Sen onto the tracks at a subway station in Queens. In 2012, there were 141 subway incidents in which a person came into contact with a train, 55 of which were fatal; that's slightly more than the average of 135 accidents per year, said Cheryl Kennedy, vice president of system safety at the MTA. Thirty-three of the 141 were alleged or attempted suicides, 54 occurred while the victim was standing on the platform, and three occurred when riders fell between the cars, she said. The installation of platform doors in New York's subways could potentially end incidents in which customers are pushed or accidentally fall or climb down intentionally to retrieve dropped items. It could also increase security by limiting unauthorized track access, resulting in less vandalism and litter, according to the MTA. However, such an installation would prove costly and complicated. ""When the system was designed over 110 years ago, it didn't plan for that,"" said Thomas F. Prendergast, president of MTA New York City Transit. ""It's hard to incorporate into the system now."" Investigations into the feasibility of installing subway platform doors included the examination of public transportation systems in London, Paris, Seoul, Tokyo and other international cities. The preliminary conclusion was that the age and diversity of New York's 468 subway stations would require major changes to their structures and electrical systems. One problem is that stations have unique characteristics, some with curved tracks and column lines near the platform edge. ""In stations where we have barely managed to create an accessible path for the disabled, construction may prove to be infeasible,"" said Peter Cafiero, chief of operations planning. ""Many stations are listed as landmark or historical, which will require external review and approval of all designs."" Challenges would include the need for platform edge reinforcement to hold up new walls, electrical upgrades in tight spaces, train door and platform alignment and communication issues, and accommodation of train cars of different sizes and with doors in different places. The cost of installation and maintenance would also be a challenge in a system that operates around the clock, Cafiero said. ""I do not want to give the impression that any death is acceptable,"" said Prendergast. However, ""there are technological issues we need to overcome to come up with a solution."" Gene Russianoff, a staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said he shared the concerns expressed by MTA representatives, but suggested exploring alternatives like intrusion-detection technology. Such a system would alert train personnel when someone was on the track or too near the edge of the platform, he said. ""It seems like it would be a lot cheaper,"" he said. Though people have been hit by trains for as long as trains have been around, he said, ""That doesn't mean you should just shrug and say it's like the weather."" Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer called last week for the MTA's inspector general to carry out an investigation into subway fatalities and to consider new safety programs. ""The MTA can't just revert to the easy fixes; I am asking that the agency take a more comprehensive approach by keeping all options on the table that make sense for the safety of commuters and the MTA's bottom line."" CNN's Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","""It's hard to incorporate into the system now,"" says MTA's Thomas Prendergast .

"(CNN) -- Mexico's new leader had a message for U.S. officials as he toured Washington on Tuesday: Ties between the neighboring nations must go beyond the drug war. The two countries should team up to create jobs, Mexican President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto said at the White House. ""We should reconsider greater integration of North America to achieve a region that is more competitive and capable of creating more jobs,"" Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama as reporters looked on. Before his first meeting with Obama, the 46-year-old former governor said he wanted to reshuffle the list of priorities the United States and Mexico share. In an editorial published by the Washington Post on Friday, Pena Nieto said there was a potential for more trade, manufacturing and energy deals. ""It is a mistake to limit our bilateral relationship to drugs and security concerns,"" the president-elect wrote. ""Our mutual interests are too vast and complex to be restricted in this short-sighted way."" Obama told reporters he was eager to develop a strong relationship with Pena Nieto and take on a broad agenda. ""We are very much looking forward to having a fruitful discussion here today about ... how we can strengthen economic ties, trade ties, coordination along the border and improving our joint competitiveness, as well as public security issues,"" he said. New president: Grow economy to fight drugs . A crackdown on cartels was a hallmark of outgoing President Felipe Calderon's six-year tenure, and the United States voiced its support, offering $1.6 billion to aid in the fight. Pena Nieto said Tuesday that his government will focus more on reducing violence, but he's offered few specifics about that approach. He told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday that boosting his country's economy and creating more social programs could be the greatest weapon to fight organized crime. Without economic opportunities, he said, ""millions of my countrymen have no other option than to dedicate themselves sometimes to criminal activity."" Opinion: To-do list for Obama and Mexico's new president . The United States is Mexico's largest trading partner. The two countries share billions of dollars in imports and exports and a border that stretches nearly 2,000 miles. For the first time in more than a decade, economic issues are likely to dominate the agenda shared by Mexico and the United States, the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars said in a policy brief this week. That's because drug-related violence appears to have plateaued and illegal immigration in the United States from Mexico has dropped dramatically, according to Andrew Selee, director of the center's Mexico Institute. FBI most-wanted fugitive captured in Mexico . ""What's driven the U.S.-Mexico agenda for the past 10 years has been the influx of undocumented immigrants and the headlines about increasing violence, and now both of those have leveled off. ... It allows the two governments to begin to talk about other issues that matter for their long-term well-being,"" Selee said. While security concerns took a back seat during Obama and Pena Nieto's public remarks, both leaders mentioned the need for immigration reform. ""We do have to tell you that we fully support your proposal for this migration reform,"" Pena Nieto said. ""More than demanding what you should do, I do want to tell you that we want to contribute. We really want to participate and we want to contribute toward the accomplishment, so we can participate in the betterment and well-being of so many people who live in your country."" In addition to meeting with Obama, Pena Nieto spoke with other officials in Washington, including U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. He was scheduled to travel to Canada and meet Wednesday with Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Obama noted that it was a longstanding tradition for Mexico's president-elect to visit Washington before taking office. ""We meet early with the president-elect of Mexico because it symbolizes the extraordinarily close relationship we have between the two countries,"" he said. Earlier this week, analysts said on CNN en EspaÃ±ol's ""Mexico Opina"" that they hoped Tuesday's meeting would signal a new approach to interactions between the United States and Mexico. Opinion: Mexico's misconceptions . ""Pena Nieto should convince Obama that Mexico deserves more attention. ... This is the moment to change the style and propose a higher agenda,"" said Olga Pellicer, a professor at Mexico's Autonomous Institute of Technology and a former diplomat. Political analyst Gabriel Guerra said Pena Nieto's government should push to have a greater influence on affairs within the United States, convincing U.S. officials that Mexicans are ""important and relevant."" ""The image of the country is very negative. There is a perception that we are corrupt and drug associates. This is a result of accumulated neglect,"" he said. Pena Nieto ""is inheriting a neglected relationship."" Mexican beauty queen killed in shootout . Some critics have said Obama neglected Latin America during his first term, and lambasted the U.S. president for not bringing up Mexico or other countries in the region during last month's foreign policy debate with Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Opinion: Mexico, U.S. ties ripe for major expansion . On Tuesday, Obama quipped that he was jealous that Vice President Joe Biden would be attending Pena Nieto's inauguration in Mexico on Saturday, and he said he was looking forward to attending the North American Leaders' Summit there next year. ""Any excuse to go to Mexico, I'm always game,"" Obama said. Opinion: Can Pena Nieto save Mexico?

"(CNN) -- When the National Security Agency sent a tweet Monday filled with garbled nonwords like ""tpfccdlfdtte,"" the Internet was confused, and intrigued. Was the NSA drunk? Had a cat skittered across someone's keyboard? Or maybe the spy agency, under fire for eavesdropping on Americans, had accidentally blurted a secret of its own -- a coded, classified message not meant for public eyes. The truth proved to be less scandalous. Internet sleuths, armed with cryptogram-solving Web tools, solved the mystery in minutes. Turns out the nonsensical tweet was a coded recruiting pitch by the NSA, which is seeking code breakers to help decipher encrypted messages from potential terrorists. The tweet was a basic ""substitution cipher,"" a code in which each letter of the alphabet is replaced by another. Translated, it read (SPOILER ALERT for all you wannabe codebreakers): ""Want to know what it takes to work at NSA? Check back each Monday in May as we explore careers essential to protecting our nation."" When contacted by CNN, NSA spokeswoman Marci Green Miller said the Twitter account is run by the NSA recruitment office, which will post coded tweets each Monday for the rest of the month. ""NSA is known as the code makers and code breakers,"" said Miller, who called the tweet ""part of our recruitment efforts to attract the best and the brightest."" If the intelligence agency wanted attention, it worked. Monday's message has been retweeted more than 1,100 times, and most major media outlets have run articles about it. In its efforts to attract top talent, the NSA has been known to recruit hackers and other computer wizards at cybersecurity conferences. The agency even set up a special page to woo attendees of DefCon, a shadowy hackers' conference held each July in Las Vegas. A job with the NSA requires a security clearance, of course. But the agency seems eager to recruit smart people -- even, perhaps, those with minor arrest records. ""If you have a few, shall we say, indiscretions in your past, don't be alarmed. You shouldn't automatically assume you won't be hired,"" said the recruiting page. ""If you're really interested, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot."" The NSA receives thousands of applications a month and is on target to meet its hiring goals for the current fiscal year, Miller said. Matthew Aid, who wrote a book about the NSA , told CNN last year that NSA hackers focus on foreign militaries, governments and corporations, and are protected by multiple levels of secrecy. Monday's tweet was not the first time the NSA has sent a coded message on Twitter. The agency has posted three already this year to celebrate holidays, such as St. Patrick's Day. But it might signal a renewed effort by the embattled agency to attract new blood in the wake of revelations last year by leaker Edward Snowden. Documents leaked by Snowden showed the NSA ran a secret surveillance program to intercept Americans' phone calls and Internet messages.","The NSA sent a mysterious coded tweet to its 10,000 followers this week .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- ""These people saved my family from an almost certain fiery death."" Doug White speaks highly of the air traffic controllers and flight instructor who helped talk him through landing a plane last year after the pilot died. He and his family finally met the team last week, after they received the highest honor from the National Air Traffic Controllers Association at a ceremony in Orlando, Florida. In April 2009, White, 56, and his wife and their two daughters were returning to Louisiana after attending a funeral for White's brother. Less than 10 minutes after their private chartered plane took off from Marco Island, Florida, the unexpected happened. ""I've got to declare an emergency. My pilot's deceased. I need help,"" White told the control tower. He had seized the radio after the pilot had fallen unconscious. ""I need to get this on the ground. I'm flyin' a King Air."" Luckily, White had three months of flight lessons, but he had flown only a small, less-sophisticated single-engine plane. That's like going from a Volkswagen to a race car, he said. In the background of their conversation, dozens of controllers were scrambling to reroute flights while Fort Myers International Airport prepared to accept the plane. ""Disengage the autopilot. We're gonna have you hand-fly the plane,"" instructed controller and experienced pilot Lisa Grimm said. ""You find me the longest, widest runway you can, ma'am,"" White responded in a deadpan Louisiana twang. Controllers in Fort Myers reached out to flight instructor and pilot Kari Sorenson, who was familiar with the King Air plane. At last week's reunion, Sorenson said he relayed through the controllers only the most critical information needed to get the plane safely on the ground. White jokingly accused Sorenson of withholding some information. ""Would you want to have heard it?"" Sorensen joked back. Sorensen had high praise for White's maneuvering of the twin-engine plane. ""Doug learned to fly that plane in 20 minutes,"" Sorensen said. ""I don't think you could have made the plane more complex or the pilot less experienced and have had a successful landing."" Grimm said she remembered White's steady demeanor through the whole incident. ""He was like the coolest cucumber,"" she said. Shortly after the pilot slumped over in his seat, White yelled for his wife to come up to the cockpit. Terry White recalled that she was initially annoyed with her husband's tone, thinking he wanted her to bring him a soda. Once she realized the gravity of the situation, ""my first thought was my girls,"" she said. At one point, Doug White held out his hand, and Terry said, ""You're not even shaking ... and [he] said, 'I am on the inside.' ""That's just the way he is,"" she said. There were times, White admitted, when he got nervous. ""I thought they were leaving me out there stranded,"" White said. ""And it's real quiet in that airplane when nobody's talking to you."" His teenage daughter Maggie White said she felt helpless. ""I mean, what could I do? Nothing, just sit there and pray and, you know, throw up,"" she said. White said he felt a bond with the team of air traffic controllers, as if they had been in combat together. The White family was shocked to learn during the reunion that they were given only a 5 percent chance of surviving. The Louisiana pharmacist has gone on to receive his pilot's license, saying he never wants to be in the same situation again. ""If you're gonna die, at least die trying not to,"" Doug White said.","Last year, Doug White took control of twin-engine plane after pilot died .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo is at the peak of his powers on the pitch and off it: The Portuguese star has opened a museum dedicated to his glittering football career in his hometown of Funchal . The Real Madrid striker is widely expected to be awarded the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or -- an accolade given to the year's best footballer -- in January and if Ronaldo is handed the golden ball it will take pride of place in the CR7 Museum. ""Of course it's a special day, it's the opening of my museum and I am proud,"" the Portugal captain told reporters. ""I have room for more trophies. I don't really want to mention specific ones. All I want is to win more awards and, if the Ballon d'Or comes, there is extra room here."" The 28-year-old is on a three-man shortlist for this year's Ballon d'Or alongside Barcelona's Lionel Messi, who has picked up the award in each of the last four years, and Bayern Munich's Franck Ribery. Ronaldo, who has scored 33 goals so far this season, made his debut for Sporting Lisbon in 2002 and has gone on to become a fearsome goalscorer. He moved to Manchester United in 2003 where he won three English Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the European Champions League in 2008, the same year he won the Ballon d'Or for the first time. Ronaldo swapped Manchester for Madrid for a then world record fee in 2009. Since joining Real, Ronaldo has been prolific in front of goal, averaging over a goal a game for the nine-time European champions. He is also the captain of his national team and will lead out Portugal at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, where it will face Germany, Ghana and the U.S in the group stages.","Cristiano Ronaldo opens a museum dedicated to his football career .

"(CNN) -- If you didn't already know, Cinco de Mayo is a bigger deal in the United States than in Mexico. Here, this unofficial holiday is almost as popular as, oh, St. Patrick's Day -- which means it's unfortunately become a drinking holiday. So much so that it's been nicknamed, Cinco de Drinko and even Gringo de Mayo. Eek. Actually today commemorates Mexico's victory against the French during the Battle of Puebla in 1862, and according to research by UCLA professor David Hayes-Bautista, it isn't a Mexican holiday at all but rather an American one created by Latinos in California during the Civil War. In a perfect world, folks would use today as an opportunity to learn more about Mexican history and culture, but the sea of margarita and nacho specials might be too distracting for some. So, in the spirit of not completely raining on everyone's parade, we've compiled a list of Cinco de Mayo faux pas to avoid so as not to offend others and/or embarrass yourself today. 1. 'Happy Cinco de Mayo!'... said no Mexican ever . Today is not Mexico's independence day (which is September 16) so you should refrain from treating it as such. You will rarely see a Mexican in the U.S. or in Mexico -- outside of where the battle actually happened -- acknowledge, let alone celebrate, the holiday. So simmer down. 2. Resist the urge to wear sombreros and fake mustaches because, well, stereotypes . While it may seem like all fun and games, these costumes essentially reduce cultural and traditional costumes to a caricature. Take it from the Penn State sorority sisters who learned the hard way after donning ponchos during one of their ""Mexican-themed"" parties. (Not to mention the offensive signs they made to accompany their costumes.) 3. Enjoy traditional Mexican libations, but don't use Cinco de Mayo as an excuse to get brutally inebriated . There's a thin line between enjoying a drink special with friends and running amok after taking 13 shots of tequila. Plus, blacking out drunk is sort of disrespectful given Cinco de Mayo is in remembrance of a battle, meaning lives were lost. In other words, keep it classy, folks. 4. Avoid using your high school level Spanish with native Spanish speakers today . Any attempts to awkwardly ""connect"" will likely come off as cheesy and empty. And, please don't ask anyone to ""speak Spanish"" for your amusement because that's just disrespectful. Plus, not all Latinos speak Spanish so you may be striking another nerve. 5. Don't plan a trip to Mexico to celebrate a 'real' Cinco de Mayo . Outside of the state of Puebla in Mexico, the holiday isn't really celebrated at all. Even the celebrations in Puebla are much more tempered and family oriented. If you're genuinely interested in Mexico, head to San Diego, San Antonio or even Mexico City on September 16 and indulge in an authentic experience in all things Mexican. 10 things you probably don't know about Mexico City . Are you celebrating Cinco de Mayo today? Tell us how in the comments section below.","Cinco de May commemorates Mexico's victory against the French during the Battle of Puebla .
Many confuse the celebration with Mexican independence day which is September 16 .

"(CNN) -- Another State of the Union address, another road trip for President Barack Obama to push now-familiar policies that he said he would pursue on his own if Congress won't cooperate. At a Costco in suburban Maryland on Wednesday, Obama amplified his call for an increase in the minimum wage. He then traveled to Pennsylvania for another event staged around the economy. ""Americans overwhelmingly agree, nobody who's working full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty,"" the President said. ""And that is why I firmly believe it is time to give America a raise."" Obama heads to Wisconsin and Tennessee on Thursday, continuing a tradition of selling his policy prescription directly to the public after the ceremonial report to the nation. Vintage Obama . In his address on Tuesday, the President talked a good game of acting on his own if necessary, but his words also showed he knows that true progress depends on cooperation with a divided and recalcitrant Congress. ""Sometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged,"" he said near the end, seeming to describe 2013 - when his approval ratings dropped. ""But for more than 200 years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress."" It was vintage Obama, blending hopeful calls for a unified approach with declarations of presidential independence through executive orders. There were the now familiar calls to recalibrate the tax code, spend more to rebuild roads and bridges, bolster education and avoid war if at all possible. He said what? Obama's speech explained . Oratorical skills . He brought many to tears with a tribute to Sgt. First Class Cory Remsburg, a disabled war veteran who sat next to First Lady Michelle Obama and waved with wounded limbs to a prolonged standing ovation. Even Republicans relentlessly critical of the President conceded his oratorical skill. ""A speech by Barack Obama is a lot like sex,"" said GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. ""The worst there ever was is still excellent."" According to a snap CNN/ORC International poll, 44% of respondents had a ""very positive"" response to Obama's speech, while 32% described a ""somewhat positive"" response and 22% didn't like it at all. Last year, 53% of respondents in a similar poll rated their response to the 2013 address as very positive. An optimistic goal . The underlying theme of Obama's fifth State of the Union address was his call for the government to work on behalf of all Americans in 2014, and his pledge to do so even if Congress refused to join him in an election year. ""Let's make this a year of action,"" Obama said. ""That's what most Americans want -- for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives, their hopes, their aspirations."" It's an optimistic goal for a President with a 43% approval rating entering his sixth year in office and facing a determined opposition in the Republican-led House of Representatives with congressional elections looming in November. Search the transcript of Obama's speech . ""What I offer tonight is a set of concrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class,"" Obama said. ""Some require congressional action, and I'm eager to work with all of you. But America does not stand still, and neither will I."" Going it alone . On issue after issue, he invited Congress to work with him but said he also would go it alone. Obama called for more government support to rebuild the nation's infrastructure, but also said that ""I will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects, so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible."" The President also promised an executive order to raise the minimum wage for some government contract workers. While the action is relatively narrow and affects less than half a million people, Obama urged Congress to follow suit for all low-wage workers in America. Opinion: Can Obama deliver action on inequality? GOP responds . Earlier Tuesday, House Speaker John Boehner chafed at such unilateral action, telling reporters that Republicans are ""just not going to sit here and let the President trample all over us."" In the official Republican response, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington complained that Obama's policies ""are making people's lives harder."" ""We hope the President will join us in a year of real action -- by empowering people -- not by making their lives harder with unprecedented spending, higher taxes, and fewer jobs,"" she said. Agreeing on immigration . One area of possible progress is immigration reform. Obama got a long ovation when he urged Republicans in the House to join Democrats in passing a Senate plan that got bipartisan support. McMorris Rodgers also brought up the issue backed by some Republicans as a way to bolster their weak support among Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority demographic. ""We're working on a step-by-step solution to immigration reform by first securing our borders and making sure America will always attract the best, brightest, and hardest working from around the world,"" she said in describing the more limited GOP approach to the comprehensive Senate measure that includes a path to legal status for immigrants living illegally in the country. CNN Poll: Speech watcher reaction less positive than previous years . Disagreeing on Obamacare . On another major reform issue, Obama chided Republicans for trying to undermine his signature health care law that passed in 2010 without GOP support. He cited the millions of people helped by the reforms that ended denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions among its benefits. ""The American people aren't interested in refighting old battles,"" Obama said. ""Let's not have another 40-something votes to repeal a law that's already helping millions of Americans. ...The first 40 were plenty. ... We all owe it to the American people to say what we're for, not just what we're against."" In her response, though, McMorris Rodgers continued the GOP attack line on the health care reforms as big government run amok and causing harm to people by raising costs and limiting their personal choices of doctors and medical treatment. This year's State of the Union is a defining test for Obama . The CNN/ORC poll indicated 59% of respondents thought Obama's policies as presented in the speech would help the economy, a lower figure than in recent years. Laying out goals . Obama said he will order the U.S. Treasury to create a new federal retirement savings account called MyRA, a savings bond that would guarantee ""a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in."" It will be available to those whose jobs don't offer traditional retirement savings programs, he said. Additionally, Obama called for: . -- Eliminating $4 billion in tax subsidies for the fossil fuel industries ""that don't need it"" and instead ""invest more in fuels of the future."" -- Equal pay for women, noting they make 77 cents for each dollar a man earns, which he called ""wrong"" and ""an embarrassment"" to prompt loud and long applause. -- Setting new fuel standards for American trucks to help reduce U.S. oil imports ""and what we pay at the pump."" -- Reworking the corporate tax code. He urged Congress to work with him to close ""wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here"" and instead ""lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home."" -- Congress to lift restrictions on transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay so the prison can be closed in 2014. Obama also reiterated that he will veto any new sanctions bill from Congress that would derail talks on preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, adding that ""for the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed."" Brazile: Obama's message: A dysfunctional Congress, but we'll get it done anyway . Increasing minimum wage . Even as he cited a growing economy and increasing corporate profits, Obama said average wages have been flat. Along with his order raising the minimum wage for workers on federal contracts, Obama asked Congress to get on board with a Democratic proposal to raise the federal minimum to $10.10 per hour. Republicans largely oppose any federal increase, saying it will place a burden on employers. ""This is definitely the President's agenda and has been for some time now,"" said CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley, who added it was hard to see how Republicans would respond any differently than before and therefore, it was hard to see big things happening in 2014. John Edwards says Dems should do more on poverty . CNN's : Adam Aigner-Treworgy, Keating Holland, Leigh Ann Caldwell, Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- Last week, I joined the board of a new organization to oppose marijuana legalization: Smart Approaches to Marijuana. The group is headed by former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy and includes Kevin Sabet, a veteran of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President Obama. The new group rejects the ""war on drugs"" model. It agrees that we don't want to lock people up for casual marijuana use -- or even stigmatize them with an arrest record. But what we do want to do is send a clear message: Marijuana use is a bad choice. There are many excellent reasons to avoid marijuana. Marijuana use damages brain development in young people. Heavy users become socially isolated and perform worse in school and at work. Marijuana smoke harms the lungs. A growing body of evidence suggests that marijuana can trigger psychotic symptoms that otherwise would have remained latent. It's possible to imagine a marijuana rule that tries to respond precisely to such risk factors as happen to be known by the current state of science. Such a rule might say: ""You shouldn't use marijuana until you are over 25, or after your brain has ceased to develop, whichever comes first. You shouldn't use marijuana if you are predisposed to certain mental illnesses (most of which we can't yet diagnose in advance). Be aware that about one-sixth of users will become chronically dependent on marijuana, and as a result will suffer a serious degradation of life outcomes. As yet, we have no sure idea at what dosage marijuana will impair your ability to drive safely, or how long the impairment will last. Be as careful as you can, within the limits of our present knowledge!"" Yet as a parent of three, two exiting adolescence and one entering, I've found that the argument that makes the biggest impression is: ""Marijuana is illegal. Stay away."" I think many other parents have found the same thing. When we write social rules, we always need to consider: Who are we writing rules for? Some people can cope with complexity. Others need clarity. Some people will snap back from an early mistake. Others will never recover. ""Just say no"" is an easy rule to follow. ""It depends on individual risk factors, many of them unknowable in advance"" -- that rule is not so easy. Richard Branson: War on drugs a trillion-dollar failure . Over the past three decades, and in area after area of social life, Americans have replaced simple rules that anybody can follow with complex rules that baffle large numbers of people. Consider, for example, the home mortgage. Once the mortgage was a very simple product. Put 20% down, then sign up for a fixed schedule of payments over the next 30 years. In the space of a single generation, these 30-year fixed-rate amortizing mortgages turned what had been a nation of renters into a nation of homeowners. For more sophisticated buyers, however, the standard mortgage was a big nuisance. For them, bankers developed more flexible products: no money down, no documentation, interest-only, adjustable rate. These products met genuine needs. But as they diffused down-market, they became traps for people who did not understand the risks they were accepting. Consider how we finance higher education. Once, state governments subsidized their universities to offer a low tuition fee to all comers. Fee increases at private universities were constrained by the lower fees at the public institutions: Duke can raise its price only so high above the University of North Carolina. The universities soon realized, however, that by setting their tuition fees low, they were forgoing revenues that might be collected from the most affluent students. Universities rapidly raised their tuition fees, then offered discounts and aid to students in need. Kevin Sabet: Legalize Pot? No, reform laws . But while anybody could understand a $500 per semester tuition bill, the new system of rebates confuses the very people who most need help. A few days before Christmas, Jason DeParle of The New York Times reported a depressing example of the toll modern financial aid exacts upon students from less sophisticated backgrounds. He told the story of three bright girls from poor families who had recently tried -- and failed -- to gain college degrees. One of them was admitted to Emory, a prestigious school with a full-ticket price of $50,000, but one that grants very generous financial aid -- if the student can figure out how to make the financial aid work for her. The trouble was that students who most need aid are often precisely those who have nobody around them who has ever successfully navigated a complicated bureaucratic institution like a university financial aid office. ""Though Emory sent weekly e-mails -- 17 of them, along with an invitation to a program for minority students -- they went to a school account she had not learned to check,"" DeParle wrote. ""Angelica reported that her mother made $35,000 a year and paid about half of that in rent. With her housing costs so high, Emory assumed the family had extra money and assigned ... an income of $51,000. ... (Angelica) discovered what had happened only recently."" Unable to cope with the school's e-mail system or to decrypt its rules for imputing family income, Angelica finally dropped out of Emory, burdened by $61,000 in student debt. In 1943, Vice President Henry Wallace published a book celebrating the coming ""century of the common man."" That century did not last very long. We have transitioned instead into the era of the clever man and clever woman. We have revised our institutions, our programs, our rules in ways that offer profitable new chances to those with cultural know-how -- and that inflict disastrous consequences on those who are overwhelmed by a world of ever-more-abundant and ever-more-risky choices. Opinion: The end of the war on marijuana . We're not going to uninvent the no-money-down loan. Universities that receive applications from all over the planet cannot finance themselves like an old-fashioned state land-grant college. But we need to recognize that modern life is becoming steadily more dangerous for people prone to make bad choices. At a time when they need more help than ever to climb the ladder, marijuana legalization kicks them back down the ladder. The goal of public policy should not be to punish vulnerable kids for making life-wrecking mistakes. The goal of public policy should be to protect (to the extent we can) the vulnerable from making life-wrecking mistakes in the first place. There's a trade-off, yes, and it takes the form of denying less vulnerable people easy access to a pleasure they believe they can safely use. But they are likely deluding themselves about how well they are managing their drug use. And even if they are not deluded -- if they really are so capable and effective -- then surely they can see that society has already been massively re-engineered for their benefit already.

"JACKSON, Missouri (CNN) -- Debbie Shank breaks down in tears every time she's told that her 18-year-old son, Jeremy, was killed in Iraq. Debbie Shank, 52, has severe brain damage after a traffic accident in May 2000. The 52-year-old mother of three attended her son's funeral, but she continues to ask how he's doing. When her family reminds her that he's dead, she weeps as if hearing the news for the first time. Shank suffered severe brain damage after a traffic accident nearly eight years ago that robbed her of much of her short-term memory and left her in a wheelchair and living in a nursing home. It was the beginning of a series of battles -- both personal and legal -- that loomed for Shank and her family. One of their biggest was with Wal-Mart's health plan.   Eight years ago, Shank was stocking shelves for the retail giant and signed up for Wal-Mart's health and benefits plan. Two years after the accident, Shank and her husband, Jim, were awarded about $1 million in a lawsuit against the trucking company involved in the crash. After legal fees were paid, $417,000 was placed in a trust to pay for Debbie Shank's long-term care. Wal-Mart had paid out about $470,000 for Shank's medical expenses and later sued for the same amount. However, the court ruled it can only recoup what is left in the family's trust. The Shanks didn't notice in the fine print of Wal-Mart's health plan policy that the company has the right to recoup medical expenses if an employee collects damages in a lawsuit. The family's attorney, Maurice Graham, said he informed Wal-Mart about the settlement and believed the Shanks would be allowed to keep the money.  Watch this couple's story » . ""We assumed after three years, they [Wal-Mart] had made a decision to let Debbie Shank use this money for what it was intended to,"" Graham said.  The Shanks lost their suit to Wal-Mart. Last summer, the couple appealed the ruling -- but also lost it. One week later, their son was killed in Iraq.  ""They are quite within their rights. But I just wonder if they need it that bad,"" Jim Shank said. In 2007, the retail giant reported net sales in the third quarter of $90 billion. Legal or not, CNN asked Wal-Mart why the company pursued the money. Wal-Mart spokesman John Simley, who called Debbie Shank's case ""unbelievably sad,"" replied in a statement: ""Wal-Mart's plan is bound by very specific rules. ... We wish it could be more flexible in Mrs. Shank's case since her circumstances are clearly extraordinary, but this is done out of fairness to all associates who contribute to, and benefit from, the plan."" Jim Shank said he believes Wal-Mart should make an exception. ""My idea of a win-win is -- you keep the paperwork that says you won and let us keep the money so I can take care of my wife,"" he said. The family's situation is so dire that last year Jim Shank divorced Debbie, so she could receive more money from Medicaid. Jim Shank, 54, is recovering from prostate cancer, works two jobs and struggles to pay the bills. He's afraid he won't be able to send their youngest son to college and pay for his and Debbie's care. ""Who needs the money more? A disabled lady in a wheelchair with no future, whatsoever, or does Wal-Mart need $90 billion, plus $200,000?"" he asked. The family's attorney agrees. ""The recovery that Debbie Shank made was recovery for future lost earnings, for her pain and suffering,"" Graham said. ""She'll never be able to work again. Never have a relationship with her husband or children again. The damage she recovered was for much more than just medical expenses."" Graham said he believes Wal-Mart should be entitled to only about $100,000. Right now, about $277,000 remains in the trust -- far short of the $470,000 Wal-Mart wants back. Refusing to give up the fight, the Shanks appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. But just last week, the high court said it would not hear the case. Graham said the Shanks have exhausted all their resources and there's nothing more they can do but go on with their lives. Jim Shank said he's disappointed with the Supreme Court's decision not to hear the case -- not for the sake of his family -- but for those who might face similar circumstances. For now, he said the family will figure out a way to get by and ""do the best we can for Debbie.""  ""Luckily, she's oblivious to everything,"" he said. ""We don't tell her  what's going on because it will just upset her."" E-mail to a friend .","Debbie Shank, 52, suffered severe brain damage in a traffic accident .

"(CNN) -- A handwritten letter thought to have been penned by the suspect in last month's ambush of two Pennsylvania State Police troopers details how he shot the officers and then escaped, two senior law enforcement officials in Pennsylvania told CNN on Monday. The letter, which authorities found during the manhunt for Eric Matthew Frein, does not offer a motive for the shooting, according to the officials. Authorities aren't sure if the letter was left on purpose or by accident, and it's unclear when or why the letter was written. But based on details contained in it, authorities think it was written by Frein, the officials said. Who is Eric Frein? State police spokesman Trooper Tom Kelly issued a statement Monday saying that he could not confirm any information provided by unnamed sources. Frein, 31, is suspected in the September 12 ambush that left Cpl. Bryon Dickson dead and Trooper Alex T. Douglass wounded outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania. A massive search for Frein followed, at times involving as many as 1,000 officers. Despite sightings and other leads, he has not yet been caught. Authorities previously said that a review of a computer hard drive used by Frein showed that he had planned the attack for years. Frein has been described as a survivalist and military reenactment enthusiast with a hatred for law enforcement, authorities say.","Letter details shooting and immediate aftermath, law enforcement officials tell CNN .

"(CNN) -- Authorities hunting suspected cop-killer Eric Matthew Frein say they discovered an AK-47 rifle, some magazines and a small bag of ammo in the northeastern Pennsylvania woods where they believe he was hiding. ""He's out in those woods right now,"" Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett told reporters Monday morning. He was flanked by State Police Lt. Col George Bivens, who added, ""I do believe that we are close to him at this point."" Tracking dogs and searchers are indicating ""we're on the right trail,"" Bivens said Sunday. He confirmed that thermal imaging technology is being used to find 31-year-old Frein, who allegedly killed one state police officer and the shot another officer September 12 outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove. Frein had been planning the ambush for months or possibly years, authorities said. Investigators said the items they found were either abandoned or hidden by Frein, who is a skilled marksman and trained survivalist. Slaying planned for months? Authorities have said that Frein hated law enforcement and that they believe that he's solely focused on hurting more officers, but not civilians. A reporter asked Corbett why investigators concluded that. Corbett answered that the night of the barracks shooting, Frein had the opportunity to shoot civilians and didn't take it. As to the rifle that was found over the weekend, it was positioned in such a way that it could be seen, and the items were partially concealed, Bivens said earlier. ""Frein obviously knows we're there"" searching, he said. Up to 400 law enforcement officers are searching for Frein, including members of the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They are combing about 200 to 250 square miles of wooded area not far from Frein's family home in Canadensis -- about 20 miles from where Frein alleged shot state police officers. Hunters should avoid the thick woods, authorities have said. Schools in the areas have canceled classes. Anyone with information or images they believe might be helpful should call 911 or contact law enforcement, Bivens stressed. Bivens also warned that anyone who helps Frein will be charged accordingly.","NEW: Suspect is ""out in those woods right now,"" Pennsylvania governor says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Kesha and Dr. Luke exchanged harsh accusations in lawsuits filed by the singer and producer Tuesday. Kesha's civil complaint filed in Los Angeles claims that Dr. Luke sexually, physically and verbally abused her over the 10 years since he signed her as an 18-year-old artist. Dr. Luke's lawsuit filed hours later in New York contends Kesha made up ""outrageous and untrue statements"" to extort him into releasing her from her recording contract with his label. Her lawsuit demands that she be paid damages for suffering he caused and that her contract with Dr. Luke, whose real name is Lukasz Gottwald, be declared void because of the abuse. Kesha, whose full name is Kesha Rose Sebert, was ""an intelligent, family-oriented, and joyful young woman"" before Dr. Luke ""showered her with promises of fame and fortune"" and induced her to sign a contract with him in 2005, her lawsuit said. Instead of living a life of Hollywood glamor, she ""lived in a prison of his abuse,"" the lawsuit said. Her complaint accuses him of giving her a ""date rape drug"" that allowed him to sexually assault her while she was unconscious. He allegedly used constant verbal insults -- such as calling her ""a fat f--king refrigerator"" -- ""to make her feel completely worthless and maintain complete control over her life."" The abuse didn't end after her debut album sold more than a million copies in the United States in 2010, her complaint said. ""For the past 10 years, Dr. Luke has sexually, physically, verbally and emotionally abused"" her ""to the point where Ms. Sebert nearly lost her life,"" it said. Kesha, 27, developed the eating disorder bulimia nervosa, which almost killed her, because of the continuous criticism about her weight by Dr. Luke, according to her complaint. She entered a rehabilitation center to be treated for the disorder earlier this year, the lawsuit said. Her doctors concluded that the ""unrelenting emotional and psychological abuse"" by Dr. Luke caused her to suffer ""severe depression, post-traumatic stress, social isolation, and panic attacks."" Continuing contact with him ""would be 'life threatening,'"" the lawsuit said. Kesha's lawyer Mark Geragos said her lawsuit ""is a wholehearted effort by Kesha to regain control of her music career and her personal freedom after suffering for 10 years as a victim of mental manipulation, emotional abuse and sexual assault at the hands of Dr. Luke."" ""The facts presented in our lawsuit paint a picture of a man who is controlling and willing to commit horrible acts of abuse in an attempt to intimidate an impressionable, talented, young female artist into submission for his personal gain. Kesha is focused on moving her life and her career beyond this terrible time,"" Geragos said. Christine Lepera, the lawyer who filed the suit for Dr. Luke, said Kesha's complaint ""is nothing more than a continuation of her bad and offensive acts."" ""As set forth in the complaint that we have filed on behalf of Dr. Luke, Kesha and her mother are engaged in a campaign of publishing outrageous and untrue statements about Dr. Luke to third parties, including scurrilous and false statements of purported physical and mental abuse of Kesha,"" Lepera said. ""We are confident that Dr. Luke will prevail in all matters, and that our client will be awarded substantial damages for this malicious conduct,"" Lepera said. Geragos said the singer is ready to put the past behind her. ""This is just another pathetic and entirely predictable example of Dr. Luke's continued abuse, and a misguided attempt to keep Kesha under his tyrannical control,"" Geragos said. ""This lawsuit has absolutely no basis in fact, the law or reality. Kesha is focused on reclaiming her voice and her freedom. She is determined to move on with her life and her career by putting this dark period behind her.""","Kesha's lawsuit claims Dr. Luke sexually, physically and verbally abused her .

"(CNN) -- Kyle Rhodes loves to consider the possibilities: He could sport a long, full Viking beard, or maybe grow a mullet like his favorite 1980s hockey players. Or he could get something nice and clean like George Clooney's signature 1990s Caesar haircut. They're all choices he's never had before -- he was diagnosed with alopecia areata at age 2, and the hair on his head started falling out in patches. By 18, he'd lost all the hair on his head and body. One day his doctor at Yale University had a thought: Since Rhodes' hair loss was caused by an autoimmune disease, why not try a treatment used for another autoimmune disorder? He chose the drug Xeljanz, which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Eight months later, Rhodes had a full head of hair. His eyebrows and eyelashes grew back, as did the rest of the hair on his body. ""I was ecstatic,"" said his dermatologist, Dr. Brett King. ""I was truly overjoyed for him."" King is also cautiously optimistic for the 6.5 million others who suffer from alopecia acreata and who also may be able to benefit from the drug. He said he would like to try it out on more patients soon. But Dr. George Cotsarelis isn't so sure that's a good idea. Some people who've taken Xeljanz have died from infections such as tuberculosis, and others face an increased risk of cancer, according to the drugmaker's website. ""This drug really can have some nasty side effects,"" said Cotsarelis, chairman of dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. ""You really have to decide how much risk you want to (take)."" King said he hopes to make a cream form of Xeljanz so that a patient can use it right at the source of hair loss rather than taking a pill and exposing the whole body to the drug. Neither doctor said he believes the drug will work for the common kind of baldness that comes with age. Cotsarelis was adamant about it because male pattern baldness isn't related to the immune system. But King said he thinks conducting more research is worth a try. ""To not imagine it would be crazy,"" he said. ""The possibility should be imagined and should be investigated."" It's not clear whether someone with hair loss would have to keep taking the drug for life. Rhodes said he continues to take it not so much for his full head of hair but because the drug has helped his psoriasis, which gives him painful dry, bleeding skin. His doctor recently upped the dosage to six pills a day in the hopes of making an even bigger dent against the disease. Rhodes said he's had no side effects and he's not scared to take the pill since he's used other potentially dangerous drugs before to combat his skin diseases. What might make him stop taking it is cost. Xeljanz is a new, expensive drug. Without insurance it can cost $25,000 a year, according to King. Rhodes said his insurance pays for most of the cost. Pfizer, the company that makes the drug, agreed to give him a discount card that takes care of his $600 per month copayment, so for now he can afford it and enjoy a full head of hair. ""I find myself a lot of times just playing with it,"" he said. CNN's John Bonifield and Matthew Stucker contributed to this report.","Kyle Rhodes was diagnosed with alopecia areata at age 2 .

"(CNN) -- Ebola is no laughing matter, especially not at airports or on planes, where screenings have gotten tighter. So, when a man on a flight on Wednesday may have joked that he had been to Africa and had the deadly disease, he received a special escort off the plane. Four officials in blue plastic hazmat suits boarded U.S. Airways Flight 845 to retrieve him after it landed in Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. ""I was just kidding,"" he could be heard saying in a video posted to social media. ""I ain't from Africa!"" he continued, as he walked with the officials down the aisle of the plane. The Dominican officials had met the plane coming from Philadelphia on the tarmac ""due to a possible health issue on board,"" U.S. Airways said in statement. ""We are following the direction of, and strictly adhering to, all Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines in place for airlines in response to the Ebola virus,"" the airline said. Changes coming to airports in Ebola scare . Before the men came aboard in their bubble-like suits, a flight attendant prepared passengers for what they were about to see. Sit down and listen, she told them. ""It's going to look worse than it is,"" she said over the PA system. The glow of cell phone cameras filled the cabin and videos of what happened later hit social media. The attendant spared the passenger who made the comment no indignity. She had seen nothing like this in 36 years of flying, she said. ""I think the man that has said this is an idiot, and I'll say that straight out, and if you hear me that's fine,"" she announced. Then she introduced the men wearing hazmat suits over bulky breathing apparatuses. Passengers reacted with astonishment, anger and fear. ""He was coughing and hacking the whole time ... that's not something you joke about,"" said Bree Manning, a passenger sitting directly behind the man. ""People started getting annoyed and just wanted him to be taken off by the police, at the very least,"" said Manning. Complete coverage on Ebola . Others covered their faces and scooted away in their seats.""Don't touch this guy,"" someone could be heard saying. A boo or two went through the cabin as the man walked by. Once he was off, the officials checked the plane then gave it clearance. CNN has not been able to confirm the comment the man allegedly made, but according to local media reports in the Dominican Republic citing the airport's director of operations, it was: .

"(CNN) -- Q: I've heard so much about the dangers of drinking soda. Is it really all that bad for you? Or is it just empty calories? You may have heard about a new study published in the May issue of the American Journal of Nutrition that found an increased risk of stroke in people who consumed more than one soda per day. These findings are not surprising in light of the growing body of evidence linking intake of sugar sweetened beverages -- of which soda makes up the largest percentage -- and diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity and high cholesterol. Sugar sweetened beverage consumption has increased significantly over the past several decades. Recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data found that half of the U.S. population consumes at least one sugar sweetened beverage on any given day. Men consume on average 178 calories per day from sugar sweetened beverages and women consume 103 calories per day. Of particular concern in light of the current childhood obesity epidemic is the increased use in children, especially teens and young adults. Soda often displaces more healthful items in the diet and is a warning sign of a poor quality diet. The dangers of soda extend beyond the increase in calories, although this is likely an important contributor to weight gain and obesity. Calories consumed in liquid form do not satisfy hunger as effectively as calories consumed in solid food form, so people often consume more total calories, which can lead to weight gain. In addition, consuming large amounts of rapidly digested sugar and high fructose corn syrup causes a spike in blood sugar and insulin, which can lead to inflammation and insulin resistance, both of which may increase your risk of stroke, heart disease, diabetes, obesity and cancer. The large doses of fructose from both sucrose (table sugar) and high fructose corn syrup may be particularly detrimental to your health as they can cause the accumulation of metabolically toxic belly fat, cholesterol abnormalities -- including high triglycerides and reduced levels of HDL (good cholesterol) -- and nonalcoholic associated fatty liver disease. Soda is also associated with symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux disease, when the contents of the stomach leak back up and cause a burning sensation in the esophagus. While drinking soda is not known to cause ulcers, it can cause symptoms to flare up. The American Heart Association recommends consuming no more than 450 calories from sugar sweetened beverages per week (the amount in three cans of cola). If you are overweight or obese, or at risk for heart disease or diabetes, you should limit your intake of sugar sweetened beverages as much as possible, including soda, energy drinks, sports drinks, juice drinks and sweetened water and/or tea.","Sugar sweetened beverage consumption has increased significantly .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Marty Rathbun used to beat people. He admits it. But he says he was pressured to do it by his boss. Rathbun was once a senior official of the Church of Scientology, reporting directly to church leader David Miscavige. He says that Scientology's leadership fostered a culture of violence among its top ranks and that Miscavige ""constantly pushed me to get physical with people"" during his time among its top ranks. ""And I've got to tell you, I've admitted to some, to doing a few of those,"" Rathbun said. ""But not like he did."" Rathbun broke with Scientology in 2004 after 27 years. Other former members support his accusation, telling stories about Miscavige kicking, punching and choking members of the Sea Organization, a religious order that is the church's international leadership team. The church emphatically denies Miscavige abused anyone or encouraged anyone else to assault subordinates. The only abusers, it says, were two of today's accusers. Meanwhile, in dozens of affidavits, e-mails and interviews, church supporters -- including members of its leadership and the former wives of some of the accusers -- are defending Miscavige and attacking the credibility of those who have spoken out. Church spokesman Tommy Davis said it was Rathbun's physical abuse of other church officials that led to him being removed from his job. Scientology under scrutiny . ""The thing Mr. Miscavige is known for, and has been from the very beginning, is he cleans house,"" Davis said. ""He is someone who makes sure that people who do things that shouldn't be done, they're removed."" Miscavige has led Scientology since the 1986 death of its founder, science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. Through a church spokesman, Miscavige declined to be interviewed for this report. There is no physical evidence to support the accusations against him, just as church affidavits attacking the accusers and supporting Miscavige cannot be independently verified. But what both sides appear to agree on is that at least for a time, there were periodic beatings within Scientology's upper management. While they disagree on who was responsible for it, both sides say top officials used physical abuse as a means of discipline and intimidation. During that period, no one called police. Rathbun is the highest-ranking member of the Church of Scientology to speak against Miscavige. He was Scientology's ""inspector-general"" and part of the Sea Organization. Members live behind the guarded walls of Scientology's 500-acre international headquarters outside Los Angeles, provided with room and board and a $50-a-week paycheck. They sometimes wear naval-style uniforms, and their billion-year contracts with the church are a pledge not only for this lifetime, but for many others they believe are still to come. But during that time, Rathbun and others said Miscavige -- Rathbun's immediate superior -- frequently assaulted subordinates. He said Mike Rinder, the church's spokesman until 2007, bore the brunt of the attacks. In a 2000 meeting, he said Miscavige pinned Rinder against a table ""and was whacking him upside the head,"" then began choking him and eventually threw him to the ground by his neck. ""He had marks on his neck for a week,"" Rathbun said. He's not the only one to describe Rinder being badly beaten. Amy Scobee, who helped run Scientology's Celebrity Center in Los Angeles, said she saw Miscavige choke Rinder during a meeting before she left the church in 2005. ""He grabs Mike around the neck, swings him around in one of the office chairs that swings around and is choking him, holding his neck, and Mike's just, like, grabbing the side of his chair, struggling, like, not knowing what was going on,"" Scobee said. ""His face is turning red, and the veins are popping in his neck, and I'm going, 'What the hell is going on?' "" In 2007, the BBC asked Rinder about allegations that Miscavige had beaten him. He denied the reports, calling them ""absolute rubbish."" He left the church soon afterward and now corroborates Rathbun's account, telling CNN that Miscavige physically assaulted him about 50 times. He says he, too, got physical with subordinates. Jeff Hawkins, a marketing manager for the church, said Miscavige attacked him several times, including once during a marketing meeting. ""He jumped up on the conference room table, like with his feet right on the conference room table, launched himself across the table at me -- I was standing -- battered my face and then shoved me down to the floor,"" Hawkins said. Hawkins spent 35 years as a Scientologist before leaving the church in 2005. Tom DeVocht, a construction manager for the church, left the same year, because, he says, he could no longer accept Miscavige's violence. ""David asked me a question, and I couldn't tell you what the question is. Don't remember,"" DeVocht said. But, he added, ""The next thing I knew, I have been smacked in the face and knocked down on the ground ... in front of all these people. This is the pope knocking me to the ground."" In addition to leaving Scientology, Rinder, DeVocht, Hawkins and Rathbun are now divorced. Their former wives, who remain high-ranking members of the Sea Organization, are joining Scientology leaders in painting them as ""bitter"" former employees who are now colluding against the church. All four spoke to CNN in a joint interview Monday, along with other church officials. Rinder's ex-wife, Catherine Bernardini, said the only time she saw any sign that her husband had been beaten was when he was attacked ""totally out of the blue"" by Rathbun. ""I know every square inch of Mike Rinder's body,"" she said. ""I know everything that's ever happened to him, every accident, every time he broke his wrist. I've been with him, we've been together all our lives -- it's utterly ridiculous, and it isn't true."" Rathbun's ex-wife, Anne Joasem, calls him ""a liar"" and ""totally psychotic."" ""He's alleging that when he left in 2004, it was because he witnessed Mr. Miscavige beating somebody up or whatever. Right after he left, I'm the first person he called. He called me right away. And it never came up,"" she said. DeVocht's ex-wife, Jennifer Linson, said she ""never saw one scratch"" on her husband. ""I never saw one bruise, I never saw one black eye -- nothing,"" Linson said. ""Nor did he complain about anything personally. And he would've told me, because any, anything that would happen, I would know about. And besides that, that's not the character of Mr. David Miscavige."" Hawkins' ex-wife, Catherine Fraser, said he ""never mentioned one thing"" about any abuse. ""To the contrary, he mentioned to me how much Mr. David Miscavige supported him, how much he believed in him,"" Fraser said. Davis, who replaced Rinder as Scientology's spokesman, said that Rathbun was to blame for the beatings and that Miscavige stripped him of his authority as he learned of the problem in 2001. Scientology officials say they tried to offer Rathbun counseling, but he refused their efforts and left the church three years later. After that, Davis said, Rathbun and other ex-members ""ganged up"" to take on their old religion. The church says DeVocht was violent and wasted millions of church dollars during his time in the Sea Organization. It accuses Rinder of physically attacking his subordinates and says Hawkins has attended rallies with an anti-Scientology movement called Anonymous. ""These are individuals who have proven not only that they would lie, but that they will get other people to lie,"" Davis said. ""It's not much of a stretch for them to all get together, corroborate their stories, find some other people who have left years ago to try and corroborate it even more, and then come to news media and attack the very person who removed them."" But Hawkins said that was ""absolutely not true."" ""David Miscavige was the one leading this whole physical violence kick, and it was him who was beating people up,"" he said. Rathbun calls the accusations against him ""outright lies."" ""I didn't come in here saying I was Little Lord Fauntleroy and never did anything wrong,"" he said. ""I said I'm no angel. I'm going to tell you I was involved in this. But for God's sake, to make it sound like I perpetrated the whole thing is just a complete and utter fabrication."" Rathbun said he never raised the issue with anyone besides his wife because of the power Miscavige wields, including excommunication. Hawkins said church members are ""not going to say anything"" critical of the chairman, and he would have lied to the police himself while he remained a member. ""It's like the battered wife,"" he said. ""The police show up and say, 'Why are you all bruised?' And she says, 'I just fell down the stairs.' She defends the husband."" But the church's defense raises a question of who knew what, when and what was done to stop the abuses -- which its leaders say is a matter Miscavige handled personally, and internally.","Ex-members say Church of Scientology leader fostered culture of violence .

On Tuesday, the latest entry in 2K's massively popular pro basketball video-game series was released to rave reviews and crowds lining up for midnight release events. One of the game's coolest features is a new face-scanning system that, on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, uses the console's camera to let you make a 3-D model of your face and create a custom character to play. Except, well ... except that, sometimes, you get this: . Clearly, some players were having trouble with the scanning process. And, to the delight and sheer terror of the Internet, the results often ended up looking like something out of ""The Toxic Avenger"" or ""Hellraiser."" The scan requires players to get very close to their camera and then rotate their head slowly over the course of about 30 seconds. In 2K's gaming forums, several threads popped up with players complaining about the glitch. Others who had experienced similar trouble were offering advice. The most frequent suggestion was to open windows to let in natural light when conducting the scan. Gamers on social media were, of course, having a ball with the freak show. ""Man, that new 'Silent Hill' is really shaping up,"" wrote Max Scoville, of gaming video channel Destructoid, referring to the classic horror game. ""Unclear why they're calling it 'NBA 2K15.'

"(CNN) -- Contrary to Katy Perry's infectious West Coast anthem, not every California girl sports ""Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top."" Such skimpy apparel doesn't meet San Francisco's style standards. For starters, the weather is unpredictable. And the city's eclectic array of designer boutiques, thrift stores and vintage shops prove incentive enough for inhabitants to stay fully, and fabulously, dressed. Blogger Dyanna Dawson and partner John Tran showcase the hottest looks on TheSFStyle.com, a website for trendsetting San Franciscans, by trendsetting San Franciscans. ""We aim for quality over quantity,"" Dawson said. ""Our blog is the highlights reel of San Francisco street fashion -- only the best make it on the site. We photograph maybe one in 200 people that we encounter."" Here, she explains San Francisco style: . CNN: What inspired you to start a San Francisco-specific style blog? Dawson: John started the blog in 2008 because it combined all of his favorite things: fashion, photography, writing and blogging. It's a lot of work for just one person, so he brought me on about a year later in 2009. I've always been really interested in fashion, especially on the consumer trend level, and John's taught me everything I know about photography. CNN: Describe the ""style vibe"" in your city: . Dawson: There's a certain utility to the way San Franciscans dress. There has to be, because of the unpredictable weather and the amount of walking the average SFer does. Classic American work wear is hugely popular all over the city. Haight Street is littered with eco-chic boutiques, while the Mission District houses a treasure trove of great vintage spots. It's really interesting to see where these three styles converge. CNN: What influences street style? Dawson: The weather plays a crucial role in dictating which runway trends actually make it to the streets. We don't have proper seasons, and San Francisco is pretty well known for its microclimates that vary from district to district. This makes layering pieces essential year round, even in summertime. Also, since most people in the city ride bikes or take Muni, comfortable shoes and handbags are worn by both men and women alike. CNN: What are popular looks? Staple pieces? Dawson: The unisex SF uniform varies a bit every season, but is more or less: dark skinny jeans, a fitted coat (usually a peacoat or trench), canvas or leather shoes (oxfords, loafers, boots, TOMS), a nice carry-all and some tasteful layering pieces. I never leave the house without a scarf and sweater in my bag -- no matter what time of year it is. You just never know what to expect with San Francisco weather. Even when it's bright and sunny out, you could turn the corner and get hit with some fog or a gust of wind. CNN: Are there any trends specific to San Francisco? What makes fashion stand out from other cities? Dawson: San Francisco is a great place to live, in part because it has so many wonderful vintage and thrift stores. The ready availability of vintage fashions can be seen in various forms throughout the city. San Francisco tends to be more laid back than a lot of other cities, so most of what we see on the streets -- and a lot of the outfits we post on the website -- tends to be casual. CNN: What makes you stop and snap a photo of someone? Dawson: We always have our cameras on us, ready to capture fashionable morsels wherever we might be. We look for morsels that strike us for their exceptional personal style. This can mean either epitomizing a popular trend we want to feature, or putting their own unique spin on a vogue. Fit is a key element, and we also look for people who are wearing standout pieces (bags, shoes, coiffure, accessories, etc.). CNN: What trends do you love right now? Dawson: We like to post features that showcase different examples of the same trend, as photographed all over the city. One of the hottest trends in San Francisco right now is animal jewelry. We usually include a poll, so that readers can vote for their favorite piece. CNN: Where should we shop in San Francisco? Dawson: We get asked this question constantly! We even have a dedicated resource page for people who are either visiting SF, or just new to the area. It lists all of my favorite shopping spots, along with some other info on where to eat and drink. CNN: What advice would you give to fashionistas on a budget? Dawson: We're so lucky to have all of these amazing thrift stores and affordable vintage stores. I know from growing up in the SoCal suburbs that not every city is as fortunate. They key to thrift/vintage shopping is to go often, and to not be discouraged when you leave empty-handed. Even the most seasoned vintage shoppers don't strike gold every time. And if you live outside of the Bay Area, there are tons of great finds on Etsy and eBay. How do people dress in your city?

"(CNN) -- Where would you find the most Christmas spirit in the world? It's hard to say for certain, but if a global competition were to be held, the Philippines would have an excellent shot at winning. The southeast Asian island nation has the world's longest festive season -- and pulls no punches in its celebratory zeal for the period, with lavish light displays, masses, and festivals held throughout the country from September until January. One of the most populous nations in Asia, the Philippines is an overwhelmingly Christian nation. Approximately 90% of Filipinos are Christian and 80% of those are Catholic, an influence gleaned from the country's period as a Spanish colony from the sixteenth century until the end of the nineteenth. As a result, while many countries concentrate on the commercial side of Christmas, Filipinos attend several masses throughout the Christmas season and faith forms an intrinsic part of celebrations. A traditionally Filipino event is Simbang Gabi, a series of masses held over nine nights culminating in Christmas Eve. It is believed that if you make a wish after completing the nine masses, it will come true. As early as September, when the dark nights come, it is not unusual to see a series of spectacular Christmas displays popping up in malls, parks and open spaces across the country. Student Christian Ian V. Bordo from Laguna province in the Philippines loves the beautiful 'parols', lights created by artisan Francisco Estanislao in 1928 and originally made of bamboo and paper that are hung up throughout towns and villages. ""[The parols are] as important to Filipinos as the Christmas tree to Western culture -- without parols Christmas wouldn't be complete,"" he declared. ""The lanterns were used by people to light their paths during the ritual Yuletide dawn masses called 'Misa de Gallo' [midnight mass], because electricity was unavailable at the time in many rural areas."" Such lanterns are now more likely to glow with electronic lights, but the ethos remains the same -- a guiding light in the darkness for worshippers wanting to congregate and pray. To Stephanie Masalta, the striking lanterns are a comforting indication that Christmas is on its way and a fond reminder of how her community comes together every year to string up the beautiful lights. ""Even I cannot help myself from smiling whenever I pass by that street and think of how devoted Filipinos are in celebrating Christmas,"" said Masalta, who lives in San Pedro, Laguna. ""This happens only once a year, so residents combine their efforts to put them up."" Student Martin Jarmin from Los Baños, Laguna, says the light displays in his town's local gardens regularly dazzle residents. ""The lighting of the park during the Christmas season is done yearly and now became a huge attraction to people not only from [my] area, but from the outside, too,"" he said. Decorations can also inspire a competitive spirit. Student Miaflor Tatlonghari said that in some local villages, they organize contests for the most beautiful Christmas decorations. The tree set up by her home in Santa Rosa City was at least 30 ft tall - and larger ones are not uncommon. Photos: Santa sightings around the world . Martin Jarmin also mentioned another Christmas tradition of which Philippines residents are fond -- gathering together to make and enjoy food specifically made for the Christmas season. For example, Christmas Eve, or Noche Buena, is traditionally when families come together to host a large festive meal. The celebration is well known in Spain and Latin America and stems from the nation's colonial past. In addition to the aforementioned Christmas Eve dinner, scores of delicious, and often highly unusual, dishes are prepared for Filipinos to gorge themselves on. These include puto bumbong, glutinous purple rice stuffed into bamboo tubes with butter, sugar and coconut, and keso de bola, balls of cheese with red waxy coverings. iReporter Mae Anne Alejandrino from Cabuyao in Laguna province loves the mouth-watering Christmas delicacies from food stall sellers who set up beside an enormous display of Christmas lights, showcasing the dizzying breadth and variety of Filipino cuisine. ""At Christmas, we cook our own barbeque and hotdogs and buy several kinds of rice cake called 'bibingka',"" she said. ""We Filipinos would always decorate our center table with colorful fruits and rice cakes. We would also prepare fruit or 'buko' [a type of young coconut] salads for dessert. But amidst the festivities, some iReporters felt it important to send in reminders of those who face a more austere Christmas. iReporter Janoah Ami Soriano's poignant images showed the plight of children forced to leave their homes after a series of deadly typhoons caused severe flooding in August in some parts of the country. Having lost most of their belongings, many relied on Catholic charities to provide them with some Christmas spirit. ""I saw that the parents were more excited to receive presents than the kids and the moment was heart-melting,"" he said. ""Helping others is a tradition in the Philippines at Christmas, especially those who are really in need."" His touching iReport is a reminder for those celebrating Christmas -- in the Philippines and beyond -- that many of us have much to be thankful for this holiday season.

"(CNN) -- Through sweat, toil and sacrifice, you built your business into a success. Things are looking good. But suddenly, a horrific terrorist group emerges that calls itself the same name as your company. Do you: A) Change the name of your business? B) Sue the terrorist group for trademark infringement? C) Keep your name and hope customers don't get spooked? Businesses across the United States are facing this very dilemma because the word ""ISIS"" is part of their corporate name or product. According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, more than 270 products or business names among active federal trademarks use ""ISIS."" They range from pharmaceutical companies to wig makers to phone apps. OK, so nobody is going for option ""B."" The most common reaction from business owners is option ""A,"" dropping the ISIS reference. The latest and most visible example is from the hit FX cartoon series, ""Archer."" Over the weekend, the show's creator, Adam Reed, announced that the series would no longer use ""ISIS"" as the acronym for the spy agency ""International Secret Intelligence Service,"" which employs the show's main characters. Reed, who plans to come up with a story line to justify the name change for next season, commented that ISIS is ""the most awful thing and we didn't want to have anything to do with it."" FX has even decided to stop selling ISIS hats and shirts. Of course, you can still get them on eBay. Just a few months ago, the mobile payment service known as ""Isis Wallet,"" a joint venture with AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, changed its name to ""Softcard"" in order ""to avoid confusion and association with a violent Islamic militant group."" Small businesses are also being affected. In Queens, New York, the owner of the ""ISIS Hookah CafÃ©"" told the Daily News that he wants to change his name but can't afford the costs -- a new sign, documents and all. This is not just an American problem. Last week the owners of ""CafÃ© ISIS"" in the United Kingdom felt compelled to change their restaurant's name. But, OK, can we all take a breath here? Both business owners and consumers. Who actually looks at the name of a business with the word ISIS in it and thinks: ""Wow, that terrorist group from the Middle East now opened up a cafe in the neighborhood!"" Or believes that a new app that helps you pay your bills is part of a terrorist group's dastardly plan? And, yes, I know ISIS is a heinous organization. So understandably, the word ISIS causes a negative visceral reaction. But we need to let fear give way to intellect and not punish American business owners. Think of the Egyptian goddess Isis -- or the Bob Dylan song from the ""Desire"" album. Or the 1970s children's TV show the ""Shazam!-Isis Hour."" The word Isis should conjure up mythology, not mayhem. Perhaps an easy answer is for the media to universally start using the name ISIL instead of ISIS. (My apologies to any ""ISIL CafÃ©"" owners out there.) That would be accurate because ISIL stands for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Plus President Obama and many media outlets already use ISIL, including Reuters and the Associated Press. But what I really hope happens is that more businesses follow the lead of the California company, ISIS Pharmaceuticals, which is keeping its name. As a spokesman for the drug company told The Daily Mail: ""We've been around for awhile."" People ""can easily distinguish between us and a Middle Eastern terrorist group."" So my advice is, if your company or product is called ISIS, keep the name. Why allow a terrorist group to tell you what you can call your business?","Dean Obeidallah: 270 products or businesses use ""ISIS"" in their names .
He asks: Do you change the name because it's tainted or hope customers don't care?

"(CNN) -- Affirmative action -- which is coming up before the Supreme Court on Wednesday in Fisher v. University of Texas -- has long been one of America's most divisive social policies. But it doesn't need to be. Universities engage in many forms of affirmative action that are uncontroversial, such as efforts to reach out and encourage minority applicants, or initiatives to make sure that admissions officers are going beyond test scores to find the strongest candidates. The battle is really about the use of racial preferences in admissions, especially the large preferences often used by selective schools that, in effect, add a full point to the high school grade-point average of every black applicant, and half a point to every Hispanic applicant, or otherwise adjust the academic qualifications of black and Hispanic applicants so as to make them appear, for purposes of comparison with white and Asian applicants, much more academically prepared than they actually are. These policies are often justified as ways of ensuring fair minority representation -- which, in turn, is supposed to foster a better learning environment for everyone. But a growing stack of carefully vetted research is finding that these large preferences often undermine the very goals they are intended to promote, because they do a poor job of matching students to the college environments in which they are most likely to thrive. A student who would do extremely well at Wake Forest ends up at struggling at Duke; a student who would thrive at a strong state university gets recruited away to the Ivy League and becomes a marginal student. News: The young woman at the center of the SCOTUS challenge . For example, students who aspire to careers in science or engineering (STEM fields), and who get into a school where they are surrounded by academically stronger students, have low odds of actually getting a STEM degree. Yet these students have what it takes to have a successful career in STEM -- if they go to the right school. A careful study led by University of Virginia psychologist Fred Smyth found that the well-matched minority students were nearly 80% more likely to achieve their STEM aspirations. Three other studies have confirmed Smyth's findings. In Fisher -- the case before the Supreme Court -- the University of Texas reintroduced racial preferences in 2004 because, it said, it wanted to achieve racial balancing of minority students in its classes. But it has pursued this goal with very large preferences, and since these students are likely to retreat from the most competitive and rigorous classes to softer fields, the use of racial preferences can easily have little or no effect at all upon classroom integration. The mismatch problem undermines diversity goals in other ways, too. Undisputed research has found that students are more likely (holding other things, such as race, constant) to make friendships with other students who have comparable levels of academic preparation. When colleges use large preferences, they interfere with social assimilation, and the minorities who are the ""beneficiaries"" of these preferences often feel socially isolated and self-segregate. Indeed, preferences that are so large that they produce disparities in academic performance across racial lines are likely to foster negative stereotypes -- just the opposite of what diversity programs are supposed to achieve. In short, large racial preferences, and indeed large preferences of any other kind (e.g., for children of alumni, for athletes, etc.) are often counterproductive. Yet universities continue to use them, partly because they may not understand the consequences of mismatch, but mainly because they are under tremendous pressure to achieve a particular racial balance -- at whatever cost -- in their student bodies. These are exactly the situations where government regulation has a helpful role to play, and the Supreme Court is poised to play it. News: Affirmative action under pressure in Supreme Court . Many observers are predicting that the court, with five conservative votes, will simply abolish racial preferences. That strikes us as unlikely; Justice Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote, is more likely to put teeth in the court's earlier holdings and simply create some tougher tests that universities must satisfy if they use racial preferences. Two reforms seem to us particularly important: Find a way to limit the overall size of racial preferences, and mandate a thorough transparency at any university that wants to use them. Limiting the size of racial preferences means making smaller, race-based adjustments to applicant qualifications -- or, to put it differently, not ignoring very wide differences in academic preparation across racial lines. And by transparency we mean three things: Disclose to applicants the way that admissions decisions are made, provide information about how students such as the applicant have fared at that university, and make some form of all this information available to the public and to watchdog groups. In other words, students need to have all available information about whether they are jeopardizing their success in college by accepting a large preference into a more elite school. These sorts of reforms would represent a radical departure from past practices; they would create a level of accountability that simply does not exist in colleges today. And they would almost certainly moderate the use of a controversial and often ineffective tool of social policy -- racial preferences -- without the heavy hand of a complete ban. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Richard Sander and Stuart Taylor Jr.","Supreme Court is taking up affirmative action in Fisher v. University of Texas .

"(CNN) -- The protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, want justice for the unarmed black teenager shot and killed there by a police officer. But the protests also reflect broader patterns of racial injustice across the country, from chronic police violence and abuse against black men to the persistent economic and social exclusion of communities of color. In one sense, the unrest in Ferguson might be calmed if the government would simply release all the details of Michael Brown's death, bring charges against Officer Darren Wilson if appropriate and hold accountable those officials who unleashed a military-style assault on protesting citizens. Yet in another sense, the simmering anger that has bubbled over in Ferguson will never go away as long as the ugly conditions of racial bias in America go unaddressed. On August 9, a police officer in Ferguson shot and killed Brown, an unarmed, black 18-year-old boy. Just days earlier, on August 5, police in Beavercreek, Ohio, shot and killed John Crawford, a 22-year-old black father of two who was holding an air rifle inside a Walmart. On July 17, police choked and killed Eric Garner, a 43-year-old black father of six on Staten Island, New York, in what has now been ruled a homicide. These killings occurred against the backdrop of a long history of black men being suspiciously, recklessly, wantonly killed by police. This is in addition to everyday harassment by police to which young black men have become sadly accustomed. In New York in 2011, 25% of the NYPD's stop and frisks targeted young black men, who make up less than 2% of the city's overall population. In Ferguson last year, as Jeff Smith wrote in The New York Times, 86% of police stops, 92% of searches and 93% of arrests were of black folks -- despite the documented fact that cops there were less likely to find contraband on black drivers than on whites (for black drivers, it was 22% compared with 34% for whites). It shouldn't need pointing out, but for the record, white people in America commit more crimes than black people. But perhaps even more significant, as the historian David Levering Lewis has pointed out, is that ""whites committed crimes but blacks are criminals."" Despite the fact that the vast majority of mass shootings in America are perpetrated by white males, we don't condemn nor scrutinize white men nor white people as a group for the acts of these individuals. And yet we ascribe the criminal behavior of individual black people to the black community as a whole. In one study, subjects were shown a news story about a crime. No photo of the alleged perpetrator was shown, but 60% of the time subjects thought they had seen a photo. Of those, 70% thought the perpetrator was black. This is on top of the host of negative stereotypes and assumptions we lump on communities of color and black people in particular. Consider two infamously labeled photographs from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. In one, a white couple is shown wading through chest-deep water with food taken from a grocery store. The caption says they ""found"" food from a local grocery store. In another picture, a black man is shown in the same scenario. The caption says he had been ""looting a grocery store."" Or consider that Americans who (incorrectly) believe that most welfare recipients are black think ""lack of effort on their own part"" is to blame. But among respondents who (correctly) think most people on welfare are white believe people are on welfare because of ""circumstances beyond their control."" In this context, disproportionate police violence against black communities, especially black men and boys, must be understood not as an issue of rogue cops or isolated incidents but as an extreme manifestation of the sort of implicit racial bias that courses through every aspect of our nation. In fact, cops who shoot unarmed black men have something in common with college students -- in video simulated research tests, both cops and college students, of all races, are far more likely to shoot at unarmed black men than unarmed white men. Every twist and turn of our society, our economy, our politics and our interpersonal interactions in America is tainted with racial bias. Sometimes it's subtle. Sometimes it's armed with a gun. But instead of talking about racial bias, and working to unravel this deep problem, we often bury our heads in the sand or â€” worse â€” attack those who try to talk about racial injustice as ""race baiters."" Meanwhile, communities of color who are already undeniably struggling in the face of racial bias have to endure the secondary injustice of having their experience and concerns dismissed, whether it's politicians suggesting that poverty is a ""cultural problem"" in communities of color or media figures arguing that black men are disproportionately arrested and locked up because ""in certain ghetto neighborhoods, it's part of the culture."" But the fact is that while white people use drugs more, black folks are more likely to be arrested for and face higher sentences for drug use. Blaming these and other egregious discrepancies on the black community instead of endemic racial bias is adding insult to injury. It also doesn't achieve anything -- except fanning more protests. We still don't know exactly what happened in Ferguson. What we do know is that an 18-year-old black boy who was supposed to start college this fall was gunned down by a police officer. Instead of releasing details about the shooting and giving the community the information it seeks, the Ferguson police have only cast suspicion on the victim and his character. This blame-the-victim response echoes the broader blame-the-black-community mentality that denies persistent racial bias while telling black folks they're to blame for the hurdles and inequities that racial bias causes. Instead, maybe it's time we once and for all face the reality of implicit racial bias in America and finally start trying to solve it. Michael Brown is dead. Unfortunately nothing we do in Ferguson or anywhere else can change that. But what we can change is the pattern of biased treatment at the hands of police as well as banks and schools and elected officials and throughout our society that actively, albeit often unwittingly, perpetuate racial injustice in America. If we do that, finally, then we might ensure that no more Michael Browns or Eric Garners or Oscar Grants or Trayvon Martins are killed. That is a vision -- in fact, a necessity -- for which it's worth protesting.","Ferguson protests reflect a larger picture of America's racial divide, writes Sally Kohn .

"(CNN) -- If you do a Google image search right now for ""cute furry animals,"" you'll immediately find yourself in a fantastic world of kittens and hamsters and ducks and raccoons. And, oddly enough, if you scroll down a bit, there's even a bizarre Photoshopped image of Tom Hanks. It's his head on a bird's body. The Internet. Just like Al Gore intended. Of course, as expected, you'll also find more than enough puppies to choke a horse. (Though, that does seem a rather strange and unethical metaphor. But, nevertheless, if gagging a thoroughbred is at the top of your Outlook, I'd think just one medium-sized Frenchton would do the trick.) The point here is that the Internet is filled with cute dogs. And people will usually click on just about anything that even mentions the word. Which is why it completely makes sense that a random puppy-related news story from Canada happily turned more than a few heads this week, even here in the United States where, generally speaking, most Americans don't particularly care about whatever it is you crazy kids are doing up in the Great White North. We assume it has something to do with beer and moose and Neil Young. And, mind you, that's nothing to be ashamed of. Well, depending on what's happening to the moose. Sinners. But like many, I first read about this trending puppy story in the National Post, where Jen Gerson reported that Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia had set up a ""puppy room"" to help students relieve stress. It's a simple and brilliant idea. But if you're having trouble picturing what this actually looks like, their advertising slogan for the three-day event pretty much lays it out: . Yup, it's a room full of puppies. Michael Kean, a third-year environmental science student proposed the idea. He told the National Post, ""It fills a niche that people need right now because students are super stressed."" And that's why they decided to work with a pet therapy organization called Therapeutic Paws of Canada. Though, I honestly wonder if the school had to specify just what kind of paws they actually wanted on campus. These are some rather burly people up there above us. So, who knows what else Therapeutic Paws of Canada has in stock. ""We weren't sure what to bring, so here's six grizzlies and a wolf."" I believe six grizzlies and a wolf is technically known as a Manitoba Petting Zoo. And in an hour somebody on Reddit will turn it into a slang sex term. I hope. But long before one of this week's planned stress-reducing events ever happened, students were already buzzing about the possibility of rolling around with little Labradoodles and Shelties and Goldens. Gavin Jardine, vice-president of student life at Dalhousie's student union, told the National Post, ""We haven't even printed posters. We just posted a pdf poster to our Facebook page and it took off. We had 1,800 shares, thousands of likes. It's gone viral on Twitter as well."" Behold! The power of dogs! Some students actually waited for almost an hour just to get into the puppy room -- which does seem somewhat counterintuitive since highly stressed-out people waiting in long lines usually leads to violence. Maybe even puppy violence. ""Boy, that escalated quickly."" But never mind the queues. What's really amazing is that -- to my knowledge -- it actually took this long for somebody to come up with such a great idea in the first place. I mean, when I was in college we didn't have puppy rooms. We had a frozen yogurt machine. Behold. The power of vanilla. See? Doesn't have the same ring to it. And that's why puppies should be your go-to answer for all of life's problems. ""We're out of salsa."" ""Puppies."" ""Dude, that doesn't even make sense."" Anyway, credit to Dalhousie University for providing a room full of dogs for everybody to enjoy. It was a really clever idea, with just the right amount of pointless absurdity. So, here's hoping you all mellowed out and did well on your exams. And if not, screw it. Puppies.","""Apparently This Matters"" is CNN Tech's weekly, offbeat look at the social Web .

"(CNN) -- The husband of former Florida congresswoman and Secretary of State Katherine Harris was found dead Tuesday morning, apparently by his own hand, Sarasota police and the family's pastor said. Anders Ebbesen, 68, had been ill, ""but it is unknown if that is why he took his own life,"" Pastor William Hild, of the First Baptist Church of Sarasota, said in a statement released by Sarasota police. ""The family is asking for privacy, prayers, thoughts and love from the community."" The nature of Ebbesen's illness was not disclosed, but Sarasota Police Chief Bernadette DiPino added that Harris ""wanted the community, her family and friends to know that her husband is no longer suffering."" Police were called to the couple's bayfront home around 7:30 a.m. to investigate a reported suicide, Sarasota police spokeswoman Genevieve Judge said. Hild said Ebbeson died of a self-inflicted gunshot. Harris became a national lightning rod during the bitterly fought Florida recount that capped the 2000 presidential race. She was the co-chair of George W. Bush's campaign in Florida and oversaw the state's vote tally as secretary of state, eventually certifying the Republican as the winner by 537 votes over his Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore. The Florida Supreme Court ordered a statewide recount of disputed ballots, but the U.S. Supreme Court brought a halt to further recounts, paving the way for Bush to become president.

"(CNN) -- Netflix has a new logo, but you're forgiven if you didn't notice. The video-rental service has quietly debuted new branding on recent trailers for ""Orange is the New Black"" and its other original series. It replaces the white, shadowed letters and red backdrop of Netflix's iconic logo with a cleaner look comprised of flat red letters against a white background. No big deal, right? Companies update their corporate logos all the time. But here's the strange part: Netflix acts as if the new logo doesn't exist. The company did not respond to e-mails and phone messages from CNN seeking comment on the new look. They've ignored requests from other media outlets, too. Nor has Netflix mentioned the new logo on its social media pages, its website or even its iconic red DVD envelopes, which continue to show the traditional branding. What gives? Corporations typically make a big fuss when they tinker with an established logo. Witness Yahoo, which turned the rollout of its new logo in September into a monthlong event. ""Maybe Netflix is afraid that loyal customers will be disgusted by the new design, like what happened with the Gap a few years back, so they'd like to pass the baton from one logo to another slowly and quietly,"" wrote Mark Wilson for Fast Company. ""Or maybe Netflix just isn't all that organized and hasn't made a decision as to what it's doing yet."" Either way, early reviews of the new look were predictably mixed. ""Even blurry it's so much better than the previous one,"" said a post on Brand New, a blog about corporate identity, under the headline, ""Shadowless is the New Black."" ""It has a cleaner look without the stroke and shadow, and the less generous letter-spacing makes it feel more like a cohesive unit."" But a commenter on Reddit called the new logo a significant downgrade. ""The previous logo is so evocative of cinema, and it still looks pretty sharp,"" wrote the user, who goes by recklessfred. ""I can see why they'd want to move away from a logo that says 'this service is mostly for movies' since they're making a big push for original TV-style content, but this revision loses the cinema aspect without gaining anything to replace it.""

"(CNN) -- Saturday night could have been a moment for Sam Berns to celebrate -- standing in the middle of Gillette Stadium, flanked by some of his beloved New England Patriots, and no doubt cheered heartily by the nearly 70,000 fans surrounding him. But it wasn't to be. Instead of having Berns as an honorary captain in their NFL playoff with the Indianapolis Colts, the Patriots held a moment of silence for the young man who inspired them and many others as he lived with progeria, which causes premature, accelerated aging. ""Do it for Sammy!"" one man yelled, piercing the quiet, in video of the ceremony on Boston.com. Berns died Friday evening due to complications from the rare genetic disease, according to the Progeria Research Foundation. He was 17. ""I loved Sam Berns and am richer for having known him,"" Patriots owner Robert Kraft said. ""He was a special young man whose inspirational story and positive outlook on life touched my heart."" Advances in kids' early aging disease . Kraft, one of the most well-respected owners in his sport, wasn't Berns' only fan. Far from it. Part of it had to do with his part in the HBO documentary, ""Life According to Sam,"" which documented his living with what is formally called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. He spoke at a TEDx conference in October 2013 about his disease. More than anything, Sam lived. A student at Foxborough High School -- in his and the Patriots' hometown -- he joined the marching band, playing a specially designed snare drum. He didn't let the fact that he weighed all of 50 pounds or that the average life span of someone with progeria is 13 years discourage him. He attended his school's homecoming dance. And above all, he kept his head up. ""Even though I have many obstacles in my life, I don't want people to feel bad for me,"" Berns said in that TedX talk. Progeria affects approximately one in every 4 million to 8 million infants; there are only about 200 children living with it worldwide. The genetic mutation tied to it causes those with the disease to produce the protein progerin, which blocks normal cell function. As they age rapidly, these children suffer from a loss of body fat and hair and an inability to gain weight. They are prone to developing osteoporosis, a disease where bones become weak and are more likely to break. ""All in all, I don't waste energy feeling bad for myself,"" Berns said. ""I surround myself with people that I want to be with. And I keep moving forward."" That attitude influenced many, regular folks and celebrities. Those tweeting their condolences included Katie Couric, ESPN columnist Rick Reilly and many Boston-area athletes. ""The warrior, Sam Berns passed away today,"" tweeted the Boston Bruins' Brad Marchand. ""He was an inspiration to everyone. You will be missed greatly. ""Fly High.""","Sam Berns had progeria, which causes premature, accelerated aging .

"(CNN) -- A gunman opened fire Friday in a Connecticut elementary school, killing 26 people, 20 of them children, police said. It was one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history. Readers posted more than 2,000 comments in response to questions we asked them in a story examining immediate shock and anger surrounding the incident. They looked at what problems might be involved and how society might go about solving them. Here are 10 of the most popular suggestions. 1. Strengthen gun laws . A lot of the posts were related to guns. ""When are you going to wake up and realize that you need to restrict the use of guns in your country?"" asked Emma Mitchell. Commenter Susan Chapman suggested changing the idea of a ""right to bear arms"" to a ""privilege to bear arms."" She said she believes responsible gun owners will appreciate ground rules. ""Privileges have to be earned, they aren't a given,"" she said. ""Prove that you are mentally stable and have a reasonable need to own a gun. Make gun owners undergo mandatory training; locking up your gun, loading and unloading safely, storing bullets separately, practices that make gun ownership safer. Give police powers of inspection - checking gun safes, safe storage, training. No one can buy a gun without a training certificate in addition to background checks. No Internet sales of guns or ammunition and no walking out with the gun the same day."" Robb1371 suggested cracking down on gun crimes. ""If you have been already convicted of a gun crime, the second time around, throw the book at them. Repeat offenders need to be locked up a very very long time."" 2. Keep gun regulations the same or relax them . Some said expecting people to give up gun use is unrealistic. ""There will never be a way to get rid of guns in this country,"" LostinSLC1969 said. ""Honestly I think it would come down to a civil war if that really was pushed hard. All we can do is find a way to help stop and prevent the violence from happening. Look for the signs that cause people like this to do this and work for ways on prevention."" Another reader said it's difficult to regulate guns. ""There are countless gun laws on the books already and any additional ones will only serve to keep honest people honest,"" said Independent4sure. ""Criminals are criminals because they have no regard for the law and could care less whether guns are banned or not. Your logic is rather simplistic or just plain ignorant and it's sad that others seem to agree with you."" 3. Arm the schools . A user called Censor Til Sin said it might be a good idea to have armed people in schools just in case. ""These shootings are happening in Gun Free Zones,"" the commenter said. ""The shooters know that the people there will have no way of defending themselves and that is why these tragedies are happening in these zones. We need to give the teacher's defense so it will discourage these psychopaths from shooting there. There is great evidence that greater gun control means more gun violence (because the bad guys still get guns and they know the good guys are unarmed)."" But Brandon Butler disagreed. ""Look,"" he wrote, ""Are you seriously saying teachers should start having guns in elementary schools? Then what if a teacher has a bad day? Come on, this is irresponsible reasoning! If this man wasn't able to get his hands on a gun, he either would have used a knife and probably not killed a single person, or he would have given up on the entire plan and just committed suicide."" 4. Improve school security . To better prevent future crimes, some readers like Katz advocated defensive measures. ""Though I am for stricter gun control for automatic weapons, I think we should have stricter security in schools, no matter how nice and safe an area seems to be,"" Katz said. ""Let's get some metal detectors or something, and require every person to go through the security checks, even if the staff knows them. Especially since, as this case proves, many people who commit these crimes are not just random strangers."" This person compared schools to airports. ""I think schools should have security entrances with armed guards and metal detectors similar to courthouses and airports,"" said Scm. ""It is no longer acceptable for it to be harder to get on a plane than it is to walk into a school."" 5. Cut down on violence in the media . Some readers were concerned that fictional violence might be having real-world effects. ""If they want to ban guns, why not ban them in movies, television, and video games?"" asked reader Bill Smells. ""Why do we allow the media and entertainment industries to glorify weapons and killings? If we're going to start regulating and banning weapons, why not start by aggressively banning and preventing the abuse of weapons in media."" ""Why do we allow our children and young adults to buy video games that put them in the position of being rewarded for shooting and killing other players? I think it's time Hollywood enact their own self-imposed ban on using weapons in any films or television productions. This would definitely reduce all kinds of violence. So why haven't they taken this bold and progressive step yet?"" 6. Improve mental health care . A commenter named brocore was one of many readers who said the issue stretched far beyond weapons and into the people who commit crimes. ""Pushing the blame onto guns diverts it from where the real need is: better, more comprehensive mental health services and facilities; addressing these issues in their infancy when they're first manifesting in childhood or puberty instead of assuming 'it's just a phase' or 'they'll grow out of it;' not kowtowing to drug manufacturers by prescribing anti-depressants or whatever at the first sign of trouble; getting people to understand that they won't be punished or cast out or labeled weird for seeking help."" 7. Think about the families, not the shooter . ""Quit sensationalizing the tragedy,"" wrote a reader named Stupify in what ended up being the most-liked comment. It was a list of five suggestions mainly asking for the perpetrator to be be ignored in favor of a focus on the family. ""Never mention the perpetrator's name; let them die in an anonymity,"" the commenter wrote, adding, ""Focus only on helping the families of the tragedy."" The post also expressed skepticism about attempts to control weapons: ""Bad people will do bad things. The only real control one can hope for is taking away whatever motivation or reward the person has for doing them, and even then, they may try."" 8. Focus on parenting . A commenter named Joe Gesa responded to Stupify's comment and said that young people are being affected by our culture and need better preparation for the challenges of life. ""We have raised an entire generation on the theory that we must protect their self-esteem at all costs,"" Gesa said. ""Then, while mom and dad had better things to do, we sat them in front of Grand Theft Auto and completely desensitized them to violence. So, if we stop shielding kids from every possible disappointment in life, so that when they face one, they are prepared for it; if we take the XBox away once in awhile; and if we actually talk to our kids occasionally, we might prevent some of this crap."" Another reader said children need to be taught how to love other humans. ""Utopian futures, while nice to think about, are unattainable,"" said user Kandric. ""Humans -- by their very nature -- are chaotic and violent. The best way to reduce violent outbreaks is by teaching our children kindness, empathy and love. Take the time to be a parent. Sure, more gun control will also help, but only marginally. The real problem is the parenting, rather lack thereof."" 9. Bolster kids' social skills . Autumn Boyer said it seems like the young people of ""generation Y"" (sometimes also called ""milennials"") are living their lives on screens. Kids are playing video games and relying on social media instead of communicating face-to-face, Boyer said, and pronouns are embedded in product names. The point: Concentrating too much on technology and the self harms the ability to understand others' emotions. ""Society and the media program gen Y and the upcoming Google generation that 'it's all about you' (i.e. iPods, MySpace, YouTube, Wii, etc), meanwhile, our kids are not developing critical communication and coping skills, and are stunted socially, psychosocially and/or emotionally due to being 'detached' and 'disconnected' from each other by living life through the virtual world (rather than the real world) of screens."" 10. Watch out for one another . User brocore said society is most responsible of all, and especially having ""empathy for every side."" ""We can immediately label the shooter an insect or whatever pejorative you prefer, but that doesn't help,"" they said. ""You can't fix the problem by casting these people out as an other. They're us, and we're them."" 11. What else can we do? It's your turn to speak. Would you like to propose your own solution, or do you have a story to tell us about preventing violence in schools?

"(CNN) -- Looks like they made it. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have been married for 73 days, a significant number given that her last marriage, to basketball player Kris Humphries, ended after 72 days. Kardashian announced that she was filing for divorce from Humphries in October 2011 after tying the knot that August, and the swift separation immediately prompted the hashtag #ThingslongerthanKimsmarriage. But in 2014, the ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" star is once again a married woman and the mother of toddler North West. In honor of Kardashian's newest marital milestone, salutes from across the Web included The Huffington Post's headline ""In shocking news, Kimye survived 72 days of marriage,"" while another user congratulated Kardashian with the tweet ""Happy 73 days of marriage for #KimYe @KimKardashian @kanyewest."" Not that the couple isn't used to the attention. From their courtship to Kardashian's pregnancy and their lavish wedding in Florence, Italy, on May 24, the pair have been the subject of countless headlines. West told GQ magazine that ""The concept of Kimye has more cultural significance than what Page Six could write."" ""Saying 'Hey, I like Kim' isn't as inspiring to people as us getting married,"" West told GQ of their decision to marry. ""And anyone that's in a relationship knows that in order to get to the point to get married and then to be married and to then carry on, it needs that work put into it. Right now, people look at it and it's like, 'Wow, that's inspiring.' "" And her relationship with her husband isn't the only thing garnering Kardashian attention. On Sunday, she posted a picture on Instagram of her and old friend Paris Hilton with the caption, ""Reminiscing about the 1st time we went to Ibiza in 2006! @parishilton it was so good to see you & catch up!! Loves it lol."" The two were rumored to have ended their friendship in 2008 after Hilton reportedly said during a radio interview that Kardashian's backside ""reminds me of cottage cheese inside a big trash bag."" Hilton later told InTouch magazine that she was joking and had apologized to Kardashian, but the former BFFs appeared to give each other plenty of space until they reunited for the Instagram photo while in Ibiza for designer Riccardo Tisci's birthday celebration.","Kardashian's last marriage, to Kris Humphries, ended after 72 days .

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors will not seek the death penalty against Justin Ross Harris, who is accused of killing his toddler son by leaving him in a hot car for hours, Cobb County, Georgia, District Attorney Vic Reynolds said Wednesday. ""After reviewing Georgia's death penalty statute and considering other factors, the state will not seek the death penalty in this case at this time. I cannot and will not elaborate at this juncture of the case,"" Reynolds said in a written statement. Harris, who was scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, also had his arraignment postponed until October 17 because of a scheduling conflict with the defense, the statement said. Earlier this month, the Georgia father was indicted by a grand jury on eight counts, including malice murder and two counts of felony murder, in the June death of his 22-month-old son, Cooper. ""We're pleased with the pace and thoroughness of this investigation, which continues on today,"" Reynolds said at the time. ""The evidence in this case has led us to this point today. Whether it leads us to anyone else remains to be answered."" He declined to take questions or comment further, saying, ""This case will be tried in a court of law,"" and not in the media. The lawyer for Harris' wife, Lawrence Zimmerman, said Leanna Harris is ""thrilled"" by the prosecutor's decision. ""He ensured us that he would only make a decision based on the evidence, not based on public opinion,"" Zimmerman said in a statement to reporters Wednesday. ""While we are relieved with his decision, it was a calculated one."" The decision suggests that ""Reynolds does not agree with the police department's first public statements that this was a case that would shock everyone's conscious,"" Zimmerman said. ""As far as my client is concerned, she has known from the beginning and she is thrilled with the district attorney's decision not to seek the death penalty because it affirms what we've been saying all along,"" he said. ""This was just a tragic accident. When the truth comes out, justice will prevail for Ross."" Lawyer: Leanna Harris passed polygraph test . The other five charges Harris faces are: first-degree cruelty to children, second-degree cruelty to children, criminal attempt to commit a felony (sexual exploitation of a minor) and two counts of dissemination of harmful material to minors. The criminal attempt to commit a felony and dissemination of harmful materials charges are not related directly to Cooper's death. They involve allegations that Harris requested a nude photo of a minor's genitalia and sent the same minor descriptions of ""sexual excitement and sexual conduct,"" according to the indictment. A Cobb County detective testified at an earlier probable cause hearing that while Cooper was in the car at his father's workplace, Harris was sexting with numerous women and sent one of them, who was underage, a photo of his erect penis. Harris' attorney, H. Maddox Kilgore, called the charges excessive, describing them as a part of the ""state's maze of theories."" ""It was always an accident. When the time comes, and we've worked through the state's maze of theories at trial, it's still going to be a terrible, gut-wrenching accident. And all the eccentricities and moral failings of Ross' life isn't going to change that,"" he told reporters. Father apparently wrote 'I'm harmless' on Skout profile . According to the indictment, the grand jury found that Harris ""did unlawfully, and with malice aforethought, cause the death of Cooper Harris ... by placing said Cooper Harris into a child car seat and leaving him alone in a hot motor vehicle."" Authorities have painted Harris as a terrible father who, after admittedly looking up online how hot a car needed to be to kill a child, purposely strapped his son into his sweltering SUV to die. His motivation? The prosecutor has characterized Harris as an unfaithful husband who wanted a childless life. Kilgore has argued his client tragically forgot his child in the car. Friends describe Harris as a doting dad, not a malicious one, who loved to show off his blond, bright-eyed boy and talked about him incessantly. Harris left Cooper in a rear-facing car seat in the back of his 2011 Hyundai Tucson on June 18 while he spent the day at work as a Web developer for Atlanta-based Home Depot. He normally dropped the boy off at day care. The temperature topped 92 that day -- which can make the heat inside a closed vehicle soar past 100 degrees quickly -- and police testified during Harris' probable cause hearing that Cooper spent at least seven hours in the car. Police: Father was 'sexting' as son was dying in hot car . CNN's Alan Duke and Devon M. Sayers contributed to this report.","NEW: Harris' wife ""is thrilled with the district attorney's decision,"" her lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- For 16 glorious years, I taught 11th-graders at a magnet high school in Miami. For me, teaching wasn't about making a living. It was my life. Nothing made me happier or more content than standing in front of a classroom and sharing the works of writers such as Shakespeare, Chaucer, Jack Kerouac, Tupac Shakur and Gwendolyn Brooks and watching my students ""catch"" my passion for language and literature. I loved watching these 15- and 16-year-olds grapple with their first major life decisions -- future careers, relationships, where to live, which colleges to attend, what to study-- at the same moment they're learning to drive and getting their first jobs and experimenting with identity and independence. There wasn't a day when I didn't feel privileged to be part of their metamorphoses and grateful for the chance to affect their lives. My classroom was my sanctuary, so on the day before Thanksgiving in 2006 when I was diagnosed with an incurable form of brain cancer at 34 and told I had less than a year to live, I did what I always did. I went to school. I needed my students to know that I trusted them enough to share life's most sacrosanct passage. Death. They, in turn, helped me to live in the moment and spend whatever time I had left living well. For six years, the only time I wasn't in class was when I was undergoing brain surgery. I never avoided the topic of my cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, with my students, but it was not something I dwelled on, nor did they. I covered my bald, lacerated head with a woolen hat and scheduled chemotherapy around my classes, and I got so good at being sick that I could run to the bathroom, heave into the toilet, flush, brush my teeth and fly back to class in under three minutes. They pretended not to notice. During that time, I even won ""Teacher of the Year"" for my region. I was grateful for every breath and felt as if I could live that way forever. Then, two summers ago, the tumor in my head decided to act up. I was playing pool with a friend when I was struck with a catastrophic seizure that left me crippled and mostly blind. After two months of physical therapy and a grim prognosis for improvement, I was forced to face that I could no longer be the teacher I once was and I tendered my resignation. The cancer had finally succeeded in taking me out of the classroom, but I wasn't ready to let it take me out of the game. I wasn't afraid to die. I was afraid of living without a purpose. To paraphrase Nietzsche, a person who has a why to live can always find a how. My ""why"" had always been my students. I just needed to find a new ""how."" Since I no longer had a classroom for them to come to me, I decided that I would go to them. In September of 2012, I posted my plan on Facebook. I said I wanted to spend whatever time I had left visiting with former students. My purpose was to have a chance to see firsthand how my kids were faring and to witness how, if at all, I had helped shape their young lives. It was an opportunity that few people ever get, but many, and particularly teachers, would covet. Within hours of posting, I had invitations from students in more than 50 cities across the country. In early November, I set off on my journey, traveling across America by bus, by train, just me and my red-tipped cane. Over the next three months, I traveled more than 8,000 miles from Miami to New York, to America's heartland and San Francisco's Golden Gate, visiting hundreds of my former students along the way. I had hoped I would discover that I'd instilled in at least some of them a lasting love of books and literature, and a deep curiosity about the world. But what my trip taught me was something even more gratifying. What I learned from my travels was that my students had grown up to be kind and caring people. People who picked me up when I fell over curbs, read to me from books I could no longer see, and cut my food when I could not grasp a knife. They shared with me their deepest secrets, introduced me to their families and friends, sang to me my favorite songs and recited my favorite poetry. As I had hoped, they recalled favorite lessons and books from class, but, to my great surprise, it was our personal time together that seemed to have meant the most to them. Those brief, intimate interludes between lessons when we shared heartaches and vulnerabilities and victories were the times my students remembered. And it was through them I realized that those very human moments, when we connected on a deep and personal level, were what made my life feel so rich, then and now. My students had taught me the greatest lesson of all. They taught me that what matters is not so much about what we learn in class, but what we feel in our hearts. I am a pragmatic man. I know there is no reason I should still be alive. The cancer never lets me forget that it and not I will ultimately win this battle of wills. I know the disease will have its way with me, and sooner, rather than later. My limbs are withering and my memory is fading. Yet as my world dims from the tumor growing in my head, I see ever more clearly the gifts the promise of an early death has brought. My travels are done, but my students are never more than a phone call or an e-mail or a Facebook message away. And from the lessons I learned on the road, I, to borrow from the great Lou Gehrig, will die feeling like the luckiest man on Earth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Menasche.","David Menasche: I taught 11th grade for 16 years; teaching was my life and made me happy .

Matthew McConaughey, who played Dallas in 2012's male stripper movie ""Magic Mike,"" isn't returning for the upcoming ""Magic Mike XXL,"" director Gregory Jacobs confirmed in an interview with IndieWire. Tatum, the film's star, producer and co-writer, mentioned in April that he believed the entire cast would return. But McConaughey is currently filming the Gus Van Sant drama ""The Sea of Trees,"" and filming for ""XXL"" officially begins at the end of the month. According to Jacobs, the absence of McConaughey's Dallas is just one way that ""XXL"" will be unique from the first film. ""It's a road trip movie, and put it this way: It's different enough that once you see it you'll understand why we made a sequel,"" Jacobs said. ""No one will be accusing us of making the same movie twice."" Matt Bomer and Joe Manganiello will be reprising their roles, and Jacobs noted that there are still new cast members to come. While fans may have their own casting wish lists, so does actor Tatum. On ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" last week, Tatum said he originally wanted ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" star Chris Pratt to appear in the first film, but scheduling conflicts got in the way. As for Zac Efron, who's reportedly expressed interest in being in the film, Tatum admitted the younger actor does have the sex appeal. ""Of course, who wouldn't (want to see him)? I want to see Zac naked,"" Tatum quipped. ""Magic Mike,"" which is loosely based on Tatum's own experience as an exotic dancer, performed well in the summer of 2012, earning roughly $113 million domestically. ""Magic Mike XXL"" is set to release July 1, 2015.","Matthew McConaughey won't appear in the ""Magic Mike"" sequel .

"(CNN) -- Texas election officials can go ahead and enforce a controversial voter identification law opposed by the Obama administration and civil rights groups, the U.S. Supreme Court said early Saturday. The decision comes just two days before early voting begins in the state. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said it was ""a major step backward to let stand a law...(that was) designed to discriminate."" Holder: My work on voting rights most important . ""It is true we are close to an election,"" Holder said Saturday, ""but the outcome here that would be least confusing to voters is the one that allowed the most people to vote lawfully. A civil rights leader reacted harshly to the ruling, calling it an ""affront to our democracy."" ""Today's decision means hundreds of thousands of eligible voters in Texas will be unable to participate in November's election because Texas has erected an obstacle course designed to discourage voting,"" said Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. A spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general's office, however, lauded the decision. ""We are pleased that the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed that Texas' voter ID law should remain in effect for the upcoming election,"" spokeswoman Lauren Bean said. ""The state will continue to defend the voter ID law and remains confident that the district court's misguided ruling will be overturned on the merits. The U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled that voter ID laws are a legal and sensible way to protect the integrity of elections."" While the court offered no reasoning for its decision, it backs up a federal appeals court ruling Tuesday saying that voting procedures shouldn't be upended so close to the election. That decision came in response to a federal judge's ruling after a nine-day trial that a Texas law requiring voters to show photo ID at the polls is unconstitutional. ""The Supreme Court has repeatedly instructed courts to consider the importance of preserving the status quo on the eve of an election,"" the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said. Proponents say the law will help prevent voter fraud. Critics say such practices make it harder for poor, minority and disabled people to vote. Minority and civil rights groups who banded together to oppose the law said it was among the most restrictive in the nation. Some 600,000 people in Texas lack state-issued IDs, according to the U.S. Justice Department -- which rejected the law as a violation of the Voting Rights Act. Nationwide, the NAACP says 25% of African-Americans and 16% of Latinos of voting age lack a current government-issued photo ID. Saturday's decision doesn't speak to the constitutionality of the law -- only whether it can be enforced in this fall's election. Continued legal challenges are a certainty, Ifill said. While the court's majority didn't offer any explanation for the ruling, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a nearly seven-page dissent, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Ginsburg said the costs associated with the law -- obtaining identity cards and the documents needed to get them -- aren't as insignificant as backers claim, and argued they harken back to the use of the poll tax in the late 1800s and early 1900s as a method of preventing blacks from voting. ""The greatest threat to public confidence in elections in this case is the prospect of enforcing a purposefully discriminatory law, one that likely imposes an unconstitutional poll tax and risks denying the right to vote to hundreds of thousands of eligible voters,"" Ginsburg wrote. The first day of early voting in Texas is Monday. Voters will choose a new governor to replace outgoing Gov. Rick Perry, new lieutenant governor, and new attorney general, in addition to voting on one of the state's U.S. Senate seats and several House districts. CNN's Bill Mears contributed to this report.","NEW: Holder says ruling is ""a major step backward""

"(CNN) -- The Obamacare website might still not be working, but journalists are. All across the country, as Republicans try to highlight tragic tales of Americans losing their current health insurance and allegedly stuck with more expensive options, journalists are coming to the rescue. In case after case, journalists investigated these stories and called the policyholders and combed the insurance exchange websites to bring actual facts to bear in our public debate about Obamacare. Here are just some of the mythical stories journalists have helped dispel â€” and the lessons we can learn from them about the reality of the Affordable Care Act: . Deborah Cavallaro was making the rounds on television complaining about how her current insurance plan was canceled under Obamacare. So Los Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik talked to her. Her current plan cost $293 per month but had a deductible of $5,000 per year and out-of-pocket annual limits of $8,500. Also, the current plan covered just two doctor's visits per year. But in the California insurance exchange, which Hiltzik helped Cavallaro check, she could get a ""silver"" plan for $333 per month â€” $40 more than she's currently paying. But the new plan has only a $2,000 deductible and maximum out-of-pocket expenses at $6,350. Plus all doctor visits would be covered. Hiltzik writes, ""Is that better than her current plan? Yes, by a mile."" Dianne Barrette also popped up on television on a CBS news report in which she lamented that her $54-per-month insurance plan had been canceled under Obamacare. But Nancy Metcalf at Consumer Reports investigated Barrette's story and found that her current policy was a ""textbook example of a junk plan that isn't real health insurance at all."" According to Metcalf, if Barrette had ever tried to use her insurance for anything more than a sporadic doctor's visit, ""she would have ended up with tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of medical debt."" The plan, for instance, only pays for hospitalization in cases of ""complications of pregnancy."" Instead, Metcalf found that Barrette could get a ""silver"" plan in the state insurance exchange for $165 per month that would actually cover Barrette in the case of any sort of serious or even moderate illness. Which is the very definition of insurance, isn't it? Edie Littlefield Sundby, a stage-four gallbladder cancer survivor, published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal blaming the Affordable Care Act for her canceled insurance policy. In her essay, Littlefield wrote that because of Obamacare, ""I have been forced to give up a world-class health plan."" But, according to Igor Volsky of Think Progress, Sundby's insurer, United Healthcare, ""dropped her coverage because they've struggled to compete in California's individual health care market for years and didn't want to pay for sicker patients like Sundby."" Earlier this year, United, which has publicly supported the Affordable Care Act, announced that it would pull out of the individual market in California. A company representative said it withdrew because its individual plans have never had a huge presence in the state. According to United, and in compliance with state law, the company won't be able to re-enter the California individual market until 2017. By then though, competitors will get stuck with sicker patients like Sundby signing up in the first wave of Obamacare. This means that companies like United can cover cheaper patients if it decides to go back to the California individual insurance market. According to a report by Dylan Scott at Talking Points Memo, a Seattle woman named Donna received a cancellation letter from her insurance company regarding her current plan. The letter steered Donna and her family into a more expensive option and said, ""If you're happy with this plan, do nothing."" The letter made no mention of the Washington State insurance exchange, where Donna could find plenty of other more affordable choices, because the company wanted a convenient excuse to jack up Donna's rates. Had Donna ""done nothing,"" she would have ended up spending about $1,000 more per month on insurance than the cost of insurance she ultimately chose through the Obamacare exchange. In fact, the practice of trying to mislead customers has become so widespread that Washington state regulators issued a consumer alert to customers. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Republicans who have been desperate from the very beginning to destroy Obamacare at any cost, regardless of facts or the urgent health care crisis facing America, will continue to dig up stories of people supposedly harmed by the law. And journalists will hopefully continue to investigate these allegations, helping us all sort fact from fiction. In the meantime, there's a side benefit to all this: If you are one of the small fraction of Americans who currently relies on the individual insurance market and has seen your current policy canceled, call a journalist â€” like one of those in the stories above. Reporters all across the country are hungry for real-life stories about how Obamacare is working. Plus, most reporters have access to high-speed Internet. If you can't get through to the Obamacare exchange site, there's a journalist standing by willing to help you navigate the exchange options and explore your pros and cons in terms of costs and benefits. The website might still be glitchy, but old-fashioned shoe-leather reporting is as reliable as ever. Editor's Note: This article has been updated to include United Healthcare' explanation of its withdrawal from California's individual insurance marketplace. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sally Kohn.","Sally Kohn: Republicans are desperate to destroy Obamacare at any cost .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Sage Stallone, the 36-year-old son of actor Sylvester Stallone, died of atherosclerosis, which brought on a heart attack, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner said Thursday. Stallone was found dead in his Los Angeles home on July 13 by his housekeeper, who was asked by Stallone's mother to check on him. No drugs were found in Stallone's body other than an over-the-counter Tylenol-style pain medication, according to Lt. Fred Corral of the coroner's office. Stallone's family was recently notified of the findings, which will be detailed in a full autopsy report to be made public next week, Corral said. Sylvester Stallone made a public appeal last month for an end to ""speculation and questionable reporting"" about his son using drugs. ""Because when a parent loses a child there is no greater pain,"" Stallone said. ""Therefore I am imploring people to respect my wonderfully talented son's memory and feel compassion for his loving mother, Sasha, because this agonizing loss will be felt for the rest of our lives. Sage was our first child and the center of our universe and I am humbly begging for all to have my son's memory and soul left in peace."" Sudden celebrity deaths often draw early speculation about drug involvement in Hollywood, but in several recent cases the cause of death proved to be natural. Although the investigation into actor Corey Haim's death two years ago began as a ""suspected prescription medication overdose,"" toxicology tests ""revealed no significant contributing factors"" from drugs, the coroner later concluded. Pneumonia, not drug abuse, killed Haim. Similar speculation about drug use followed the December 2009 death of actress Brittany Murphy. The coroner eventually ruled that Murphy died from a combination of pneumonia, an iron deficiency and multiple drug intoxication. The drugs involved are legal and are used to treat respiratory infections, according to the autopsy report. Stallone was engaged to be married and was working on various film projects at the time of his death. He acted in several movies, including ""Daylight"" and ""Rocky V"" with his father. The younger Stallone also co-founded Grindhouse Releasing, a company that describes itself as ""dedicated to the restoration and preservation of motion pictures historically held in very low regard."" CNN's Douglas Hyde contributed to this report.","Over-the-counter pain medication only drug found in Stallone's body, coroner says .

"(CNN) -- With the news that a Liberian citizen has been diagnosed with Ebola on U.S. soil, the Obama administration must finally act to ensure that the disease does not spread further. For weeks, I have been calling upon the administration to take a robust, proactive approach to prevent Ebola from becoming a public health crisis here in the United States. These steps include appointing a single, accountable official to coordinate with the many agencies tasked with containing the Ebola epidemic, and moving from passive to active screening at U.S. ports of entry for all passengers traveling from countries with known outbreaks of Ebola. Ebola prompts talk of enhanced screening . These common sense steps, while not foolproof, would go far in preventing an outbreak of Ebola and assuring the American people that their leaders are not taking the threat of this disease for granted. The recent case of Ebola in Dallas is instructive. Currently, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), under the direction of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), engages in ""passive"" screening for Ebola. This means that CBP only stops travelers who are showing symptoms of Ebola. Carriers of Ebola who are not yet showing symptoms could enter the country without so much as a question about their potential contact with the disease. Instead, we rely on government officials from West Africa to ask those kinds of questions at the point of departure. If they fail to do so or if the person lies on their exit form, there is nothing to stop infected individuals from traveling to the United States. Can you catch Ebola on a plane? This must change. Moving from passive to active screening would give the CBP the power to more thoroughly review international passengers before they are allowed into the United States. Just as travelers are now asked where they have been, whether they are bringing in fruits or vegetables or have been in contact with livestock, travelers from West Africa would be asked if they were in contact with someone with Ebola, someone displaying symptoms of Ebola, or if they have any symptoms of Ebola. If the answer is yes or suspicions are raised, the passenger would be referred to CDC officials for additional questioning, medical screening and quarantine, if necessary. CDC chief: U.S. can stop Ebola in its tracks . This particular patient in Dallas apparently did have contact with someone with Ebola and might well have been identified by active screening. This case proves that in today's global society, great distance will not prevent a disease like Ebola from spreading from Africa to the United States. It is only a few hours and a plane flight away. Now we need to think about the next case, not the last one, and what we can do to ensure that no more Americans are exposed unwittingly to this disease. There's no reason to panic, but there's no reason to be complacent, either. President Obama told the American people that it was ""unlikely"" Ebola would reach our shores. We are now told that it is unlikely that Ebola will spread. But our government should not play the odds or rely on luck when it comes to the health and welfare of the American people. This administration has a history of allowing manageable situations to spiral out of control before taking action. We can't be reactive when it comes to this disease. The administration must lead, and it must take proactive steps to ensure that the initial case of Ebola in the United States remains an isolated incident.","Rob Portman: Some common sense steps could help protect U.S. from Ebola .

"(Health.com)  -- The growing use of a popular drug in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder is based largely on a single, flawed clinical trial that may be steering doctors and patients away from drugs with a more established track record, a new review published this week in the journal ""PLoS Medicine"" suggests. The drug, Abilify (aripiprazole), was initially used to treat schizophrenia and acute episodes of mania, the better-than-good feeling that characterizes bipolar disorder. In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration also approved it for long-term use in bipolar patients whose moods have stabilized (known as ""maintenance"" therapy). Since then Abilify sales have more than doubled, according to market research cited in the review. And a 2008 survey of doctors found that it had become the first-choice drug for bipolar maintenance therapy among 23% of psychiatrists and 16% of primary care physicians. Health.com: Subtle signs of bipolar disorder . The medical research does not appear to justify the widespread use of Abilify for maintenance therapy, says psychiatrist Alexander C. Tsai, M.D., one of the lead authors of the review and a visiting researcher at Harvard University. ""We failed to find sufficient data to support its use."" Tsai emphasizes that individuals taking Abilify for bipolar disorder should not abruptly stop the medication. ""It may actually be working for some people,"" he says. ""But it's certainly worth talking to your doctor about how it's working for you."" After noticing that a growing number of patients seemed to be asking for Abilify by name, Tsai and his colleagues performed an in-depth search of double-blind, randomized controlled trials -- both published and unpublished -- on the use of Abilify for the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder. Studies of that design are considered the gold standard of medical research. Health.com: Bipolar celebrities: does it make them more creative? Their search turned up just one clinical trial, data from which was used in two published studies. The trial was funded jointly by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., the Japanese company that developed Abilify, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, which markets the drug in the U.S. That trial had several important limitations, according to Tsai and his coauthors. For one, they say, it may have been too short to judge the drug's true effectiveness in preventing mood swings over the long term. The first phase of the trial lasted for 26 weeks, and less than one-fifth of the participants went on to complete the 48-week follow-up phase. What's more, the study population was limited to people whose mood had already stabilized on Abilify during the preliminary phase of the trial, and the placebo group therefore consisted of patients who were abruptly switched from Abilify to placebo. The potentially harmful effects of rapid drug withdrawal may have made the placebo group appear artificially prone to relapse -- the key finding that made Abilify appear beneficial, Tsai and his colleagues say. Health.com: 10 tips for treating bipolar disorder . Psychiatrists have continued to refer to the results of the trial despite these weaknesses, Tsai says. ""Frankly, I think it's an embarrassment to the profession that [Abilify] has been accepted so uncritically for this indication."" Gregory E. Simon, M.D., a psychiatrist at Group Health Research Institute, in Seattle, says that the perceived flaws noted in the review are not so clear-cut. ""The methods of studying long-term effectiveness are complex, and experts disagree regarding the best ways to study this question,"" he says. Alternatives within the same class of drugs, known as atypical antipsychotics, include Seroquel (quetiapine) and Zyprexa (olanzapine). Older drugs, such as lithium, also remain in popular use. Evidence for the long-term effectiveness of lithium is far stronger than that for newer medications, including Abilify, Simon says. For that reason, lithium remains his first-line treatment for maintenance therapy in bipolar disorder, despite the potentially dangerous side effects associated with too-high doses. Health.com: Must-read books about bipolar disorder . The increased use of Abilify for maintenance therapy may be leading to higher treatment costs for consumers, Tsai says. Abilify runs upwards of $600 for a month's supply and is not yet available in a generic form. ""But our main concern,"" he adds, ""is that patients are getting diverted from more effective treatments."" Sonia Choi, the director of public affairs for Bristol-Myers Squibb, said in a statement that the company has conducted five long-term studies of Abilify in the maintenance of bipolar disorder, some of which were presented at medical conferences rather than published in peer-reviewed journals. (Tsai and his colleagues restricted their analysis to peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials.) Bristol-Myers Squibb and Otsuka are committed to making data from those studies available to physicians, Choi said. ""We are confident in the Abilify clinical development program and will continue to make available information about the efficacy and safety of Abilify from our studies in this and other indicated uses."" Sandy Walsh, an FDA spokesperson, said the agency will review the new study. Copyright Health Magazine 2011 .","Journal says treatment largely based on a single, flawed clinical trial .

"(Health.com ) -- I was six months pregnant when a smiling stranger on a bus asked where I was delivering. Within minutes, this woman was sharing intimate details of her own birthing experience -- the water breaking, the contractions that failed to get closer together, and the way her doctor deftly sewed up the four-inch incision from her Caesarean section. ""I'm telling you, this guy was good,"" she said. ""Next time, I'm just scheduling my C-section. None of this pushing stuff."" I reached my stop before I could probe her for more specifics. But, I have to admit, her ringing endorsement made C-sections seem pretty appealing. After all, for most of us, the thought of pushing a baby through a centimeters-wide opening is at least daunting, if not downright terrifying. And, the fact is, a C-section is so routine these days that many regard it as simply an alternative to vaginal delivery, not major abdominal surgery. Except that's exactly what it is. And today, one in three babies is born via C-section, according to the most recent data -- a 50 percent increase over the previous decade. ""We think the rate is going to go up even more,"" says Hope Ricciotti, M.D., associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. When the procedure is needed -- when the mother or baby is in distress or other factors make a vaginal delivery hazardous -- it can be a lifesaver. But only about 5 percent of C-sections are true emergencies, estimates George Macones, M.D., chairman of the depart­ment of obstetrics and gynecology at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, in Missouri. Around 3 percent are completely elective, meaning there's no medical reason whatsoever, but the vast majority of C-sections actually fall into a gray zone: the baby looks big, mom is past her due date, labor isn't progressing well. A growing number of critics are now questioning whether so many of these healthy pregnancies should end with surgery. ""There's no question that there's a basic, irreducible number of C-sections we need to do for women's health,"" Ricciotti says. ""But there's also no question that we're doing too many in the United States."" Health.com: How to sooth heartburn during pregnancy . It takes at least four weeks to recover from a Caesarean section -- which involves cutting through the skin, tissue, and uterine wall, extracting the baby and placenta, and sewing the incision -- compared with one or two weeks for vaginal deliveries. The surgery carries with it the risk of infection, blood loss, and blood clots, as well as other potentially fatal complications. While we've all heard that type A moms and profit-seeking doctors are fueling this trend, the truth is far more complex. Here's the real story, and what every woman needs to know before she gets pregnant. Why C-sections are so hot . Reason #1: Better technology is picking up more potential problems . From third-trimester ultrasounds that predict the size of the baby to monitors that check the baby's heart rate during labor and delivery, obstetricians and hospitals rely on technology more than ever to flag potential problems during pregnancy, labor, and delivery. If there's a hint of trouble, they're more likely to play it safe and do a Caesarean, Macones says. ""Continuous recording of the fetal heart rate came into being in the 1970s and is likely a big contributor to the increase in C-sections,"" he says. ""Doctors today are more inclined to do a C-section if there is anything of concern."" Heath.com: The curious history in birth control . Reason #2: Moms are older . More women are waiting later to have children, and ""C-sections increase with [maternal] age,"" Macones says. Older women have more medical problems that can complicate delivery, have a more difficult time pushing a baby out, and are more likely to ask for C-sections, he notes. Heath.com: Is your fertility window closing? On top of that, the fertility treatments that many older women use to get pregnant lead to more twins, triplets, etc. -- and multiples often demand a surgical delivery. ""It's very hard to predict how the second baby will come out,"" says Owen Montgomery, M.D., assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Drexel University College of Medicine, noting that complicated positions are more common among multiples. Plus, after a trial published in The Lancet in 2002 found that delivering a breech baby (one whose head is up high and feet or butt are positioned to come out first) by C-section is safer for the fetus, the surgery became the default method for delivering multiples, regardless of the position of the babies. Reason #3: More of today's moms-to-be are overweight . Pregnant women with body mass indexes of 30 or higher are more likely to require C-sections. And today, 34 percent of women over the age of 20 fit into this ""clinically obese"" category, compared with 26 percent a decade or so ago, according to the American Heart Association. ""Heavier women have bigger babies,"" which are tougher to push out, Ricciotti says. What's more, too much fatty tissue can prevent the baby from moving smoothly through the birth canal and keep the body from absorbing medications designed to speed labor along. Obese women also have more medical problems, like diabetes and high blood pressure, which might require induction of labor, setting them up for unwanted C-sections (see below). Reason #4: More inductions mean more C-sections . What's the problem with inducing labor? The process doesn't always work as well as natural labor, so in those cases there's a 35 to 50 percent chance that you'll need a Caesarean, Montgomery estimates. Inducing with drugs, manually stripping the membranes connecting the amniotic sac to the uterine walls, or rupturing the amniotic sac to cause contractions doesn't always do the job. And with inductions at an all-time high, making up more than 22 percent of births, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), it follows that Caesareans have spiked, too. Reason #5: One C-section leads to another . Once you have a C-section, doctors generally advise that you have one with subsequent deliveries. Vaginal birth after a Caesarean (VBAC), which used to be widely available, is rarely performed these days, after a 1999 study showed a slight chance that the scar could give way, posing ""a catastrophic risk to the mother and baby,"" Ricciotti says. Around that time, ACOG recommended that doctors perform VBACs only in centers that can provide emergency C-sections, explains Jeffrey V. Spencer, M.D., a fetal-medicine specialist at the Anne Arundel Medical Center in Annapolis, Maryland. Plus, there are liability concerns for doctors if a VBAC goes wrong. Heath.com: The risks of having babies after 40 . This trend may reverse itself, however. ""Multiple C-sections have risks as well, such as injury due to hardened scar tissue and a greater risk that [in subsequent pregnancies] the placenta will implant abnormally,"" Macones says. In March, the National Institutes of Health will re-evaluate whether VBACs should be more widely available. Are C-sections really riskier? There's really no way to 100 percent know which is a safer way to deliver. ""Unequivocally, I can state that the safest method is an uncomplicated vaginal delivery,"" says Catherine Spong, M.D., chief of the pregnancy and perinatology branch of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Maryland. ""That said, we don't know who will wind up having an uncomplicated vaginal delivery."" Heath.com: The tricky business of scheduling a C-section . Macones, who led a large study on VBACs last year that found it was impossible to determine whether a vaginal delivery would be safe for women who had had a prior Caesarean, seconds Spong's assessment. ""It is hard to get a great comparison of vaginal versus Caesarean, mainly because there are so many factors that go into the decision to have one or the other,"" he explains. Scientists have batted around the idea of conducting a study that would compare a planned vaginal birth with a planned C-section. But such a trial would have to control for all sorts of variables, and, even more daunting, Spong says, ""you'd need people who'd be willing to have their birth method chosen for them randomly by a computer."" That, experts say, may not happen anytime soon. What every woman needs to know . When a normal pregnancy takes a turn for the worse, few procedures work better or are easier for doctors to master than a C-section. And that has helped the in-case-of-emergency route become a safe route at the first sign of any trouble, says Atul Gawande, M.D., a general and endocrine surgeon at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital and author of ""Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance."" Brettne Bloom, a 34-year-old literary agent in New York City, is grateful to have had a Caesarean. When her doctor found that her baby had stopped growing three weeks before her due date, she delivered via C-section. ""I just feel so lucky to live at a time when C-sections are relatively simple procedures,"" says Bloom, whose daughter Eloisa is now a healthy 2-year-old. ""I didn't care how she arrived in the world as long as she was safe."" Heath.com: Fertility success rates in your 30s and 40s . That's what every mom-to-be wants: a healthy baby. So if you're pregnant, schedule a conversation with your OB and ask, ""What's your philosophy about C-sections?"" Montgomery advises. Get your doctor's opinion on what's safe and within your control, because you may be asked to OK a gray-area C-section at the eleventh hour. The more informed you are, the better and safer delivery you'll have -- whether it's via Caesarean section or not.

"(CNN) -- I like to joke that the difference between other places I've lived and Indiana is that seeing a goat or a chicken used to be a field trip; now it's my commute. Humor aside, though, one of the perks of living much closer to farmland is the access that we have to amazingly fresh food. I haven't always been the healthiest of eaters, but in recent years that has changed. Two summers ago, we participated in a ""farm share,"" where every week we would get a box of organically raised produce. It's not an understatement to say that this completely redefined the eating habits of my family. We went from a meat-heavy diet to a much more vegetable-oriented one. My wife became much more concerned with how our food was raised and processed. Before long, she was near-obsessed with whether our food was ""organic."" We're not alone. Organic food, or food grown without synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, antibiotics or hormones, now accounts for more than $31 billion in sales each year. More than 4% of all food sold is organic, and whole industries have sprung up around its production and sale. Most people who buy organic food do so for its purported health benefits. Often, people will claim that it's more natural production leads to better nutrition. Others cite pesticides and other substances in nonorganic food as being hazardous to your health. Those who believe this are willing to pay a premium (and organic food usually comes with one) for those benefits. A recent study, though, calls into question whether those benefits are actually real. In this month's Annals of Internal Medicine, a manuscript examined all the studies published in the medical literature from 1996 through 2009 that compared organic and conventionally grown food. There were 223 such studies that compared these foods for nutrient and contaminant content. There were no significant differences in vitamin content between organic and nonorganic foods. Of the 11 other nutrients studied, none were significantly different once adjustments were made for study quality. Although some differences existed between levels of detectable pesticides, in only three studies did contamination exceed the maximum allowed limits, and none of those were in the United States. There was no statistically significant difference in bacterial contamination, fungal toxins or heavy metal contaminations. An additional 17 studies looked at the effect of organic and nonorganic foods in human beings. Three looked at whether organic foods in pregnant women and children might protect against allergies (they didn't overall). Two found that children on organic diets had lower organophosphates (compounds used in herbicides and pesticides) ]in their urine, but no actual health benefits could be detected from that difference. Of the 11 reports in nonpregnant adults, only one reported a clinical outcome. It turned out that people who ate organic meat in the winter were more likely to get a campylobacter infection, which could lead to food poisoning. This is a lot of research. I've done systematic reviews before, and I can tell you that reviewing hundreds of studies is not only a lot of work, but it also shows that this domain has been researched extensively. Organic food has almost no evidence showing health benefits. This comes as no surprise to many detractors of organic food. None other than Norman Borlaug, who arguably saved more lives than any other person in human history by deveolping disease resistant, high-yielding plant varieties (earning him a Nobel peace prize in 1970), claimed that organic food was ""ridiculous."" He, along with others, has long argued that there is no way to feed the world's population without chemical fertilizers and technological advancements, and that with no proven benefits from avoiding those components, we are only hurting ourselves and the chance of others to eat cheaply and easily by advocating for them. My wife remains unmoved. So do my friends. I'm sure many of you who believe in the benefits of organic food are similarly unimpressed. The continued focus on organic food has potential problems, though. Because it doesn't use as many fertilizers, organic farming requires more land to grow the same amount of food as conventional industrial farming. A Scientific American article asserted ""nothing has been more disruptive to the planet's ecosystem and its inhabitants than agriculture,"" and included in its assessment organic farming. Organic farming can even result in a disrupted ecosystem, according to one report. Moreover, some scientific advancements have even engineered food with more nutrients than organic farming produces. Making healthy food more expensive also potentially puts it out of reach of those with limited means. I've watched this debate intensify in the last week. This is a subject that stirs deep passions in both those who favor and disdain organic foods. I think we're missing the point, though. The benefit of organic food is that it tends to help us to eat more healthily. But it's the focus toward fruits, vegetables and less processed foods themselves that's the benefit, not the lack of pesticides. My eating habits changed because I was eating a wider variety of healthy foods -- and they tasted good. That's not because of how they were fertilized as much as it was that they were fresh and nonindustrial. Once you've tasted a home-grown tomato, then the ones you buy in the store are never tolerable again. People who try locally grown produce are often amazed at the difference in taste. It turned out that I liked some vegetables more than I knew, and that helped me to want to eat them more. The current argument over organic food is somewhat of a waste. Most of those people who are quibbling over it are already eating reasonably well. They don't need the extra benefits, even if they did exist. But there are whole swaths of people out there who have never had a locally grown vegetable, and think they're all tasteless . Those are the people who might benefit from changes in diet. If we could focus on the added benefits of more vegetables and less meat period, and recognize that organic food might help convert some from one to the other, then we've won. Perhaps more backyard growing when possible, or farm shares when not, might do the trick. We should celebrate good food for what it is -- good tasting and good for you. We should spend less time arguing over minutiae that are irrelevant both in theory and in practice. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron Carroll.","Aaron Carroll: A local ""farm share"" program introduced his family to local grown produce .

"(CNN) -- There's nothing like getting stuck into a good book -- but getting stuck in a good book store is a different matter. Just ask David Willis, a tourist from Texas who was inadvertently locked inside a London retailer for several hours, after strolling in minutes before the store was closing. Willis, from Dallas, entered the Waterstones store near London's Trafalgar Square on Thursday evening to use the store's WiFi. ""I walked into the store about five minutes before 9 p.m.,"" he told the UK's ITV television network. ""I walked in right past employees and I needed to use the internet... I peeked up on the second floor and saw there were chairs and a table up there so I walked up there and was using the internet for 10 or 15 minutes and all the lights were on upstairs. ""I get ready to leave and I walk down and it's completely dark and the doors were locked."" Willis said despite setting an alarm off by trying to open the doors and speaking to a security guard and police via telephone, no one came to his aid. After several hours of waiting, he took to social media to broadcast his plight, posting on Twitter and Instagram. That did the trick. As his messages were retweeted thousands of times, a Waterstones employee spotted them and secured his release. The bookstore posted its own Twitter message shortly afterward, announcing: ""We're pleased to announce that @DWill_ is a free man once more. Thanks for your concern and tweets!"" After three hours in captivity, Willis followed that with his own Twitter declaration: ""I'm free"". Speaking the morning after his ordeal, Willis told ITV: ""I'm very tired, I did not sleep very much last night but it feels good to be free.""

"(CNN) -- The president she once pointed a gun at has been dead for nearly three years, and her longtime idol and leader, Charles Manson, remains in prison. Lynnette ""Squeaky"" Fromme appears in court in Los Angeles, California, in December 1969. However, Lynette ""Squeaky"" Fromme is about to get her first taste of real freedom in more than three decades. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Fromme, now 60, is set to be released on parole August 16. Fromme is housed at Federal Medical Center  Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas. For years, she was one of Manson's few remaining followers, as many other ""Manson Family"" members have shunned him. A prison spokeswoman would not say whether Fromme continues to correspond with Manson. Fromme was convicted in 1975 of pointing a gun at then-President Gerald Ford in Sacramento, California. Secret Service agents prevented her from firing, but the gun was later found to have no bullet in the chamber, although it contained a clip of ammunition. In a 1987 interview with CNN affiliate WCHS, Fromme, then housed in West Virginia, recalled the president ""had his hands out and was waving ... and he looked like cardboard to me. But at the same time, I had ejected the bullet in my apartment and I used the gun as it was."" She said she knew Ford was in town and near her, ""and I said, 'I gotta go and talk to him,' and then I thought, 'That's foolish. He's not going to stop and talk to you.' People have already shown you can lay blood in front of them and they're not, you know, they don't think anything of it. I said, 'Maybe I'll take the gun,' and I thought, 'I have to do this. This is the time.' "" She said it never occurred to her that she could wind up in prison. Asked whether she had any regrets, Fromme said, ""No. No, I don't. I feel it was fate."" However, she said she thought that her incarceration was ""unnecessary"" and that she couldn't see herself repeating her offense. ""My argument to the jury was, if she wanted to kill him, she would have shot him,"" John Virga, a Sacramento attorney appointed to defend Fromme, told CNN on Tuesday. ""She'd been around guns. And let's be realistic: We know the Manson family, at least some of them, are killers."" Fromme was sentenced to life in prison, but parole was an option at the time, although the federal system later abolished it, said Felicia Ponce, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisons. Inmates do receive ""good time"" -- for every year and one day they serve, Ponce said, 54 days are lopped off their sentence. Fromme became eligible for parole in 1985, Ponce said. According to reports, she for years waived her right to a parole hearing. The Bureau of Prisons would not say whether she changed her mind and requested a hearing, but the U.S. Parole Commission's Web site says that everyone who wishes to be considered for parole, except those committed under juvenile delinquency procedures, must complete a parole application. Federal inmates serving life are generally paroled after 30 years, unless the parole commission decides to block the release, according to a commission spokesman. Inmates who are paroled remain under supervision until the commission decides to terminate the sentence. Fromme was not granted parole until July 2008, Ponce said. She was not released then, however, because of extra time added to her sentence for a 1987 escape from the West Virginia prison, which occurred after her interview that same year. She was found two days later, only a few miles from the prison. At the time, prison officials said they were looking into rumors that Fromme escaped after hearing Manson was ill, according to news reports. FMC-Carswell spokeswoman Maria Douglas would not comment on Fromme's behavior in prison in recent years. Fromme reportedly joined Manson's family after meeting him in California in 1967. She was not involved in the murders of seven people, including pregnant actress Sharon Tate, on August 9 and 10, 1969, that landed Manson and other followers in prison. However, she and other Manson followers maintained a vigil outside the courthouse during his trial. In the WCHS interview, Fromme said that Manson should not be incarcerated because ""he didn't kill anybody. ... I would rather be in, because I know I laid a lot of my thinking in his mind."" Virga said he told the jury that Fromme assaulted Ford, but did not attempt to assassinate him. If Fromme had killed the president, no one would have listened to her, he said. ""She didn't want people to think she was a kook."" And she wasn't, he said, recalling that Fromme was very cooperative during her trial and describing her as ""a bright, intelligent young woman"" from a middle-class family. ""It's just hard to imagine how she got all caught up with Manson,"" he said. Fromme wanted to be heard on issues including the environment, he said. ""She had certain causes that she wanted to talk about. But first and foremost in her mind was always Manson."" Explaining herself after the attempt, according to the book ""Real Life at the White House,"" Fromme said, ""Well, you know, when people treat you like a child and pay no attention to the things you say, you have to do something."" During her trial, Virga traveled to Washington to depose Ford, who testified on videotape about the incident. In the 1978 interview, Fromme called Manson ""a once-in-a-lifetime soul. ... He's got more heart and spirit than anyone I've ever met."" She said she still corresponded with him. ""He's got everything he wants coming from me, 'cause he gave me everything."" She said then she didn't plan to seek a parole hearing: ""The parole board does not hold my life in its hands. And I don't want to be too critical, but men tend to think they do. Charlie never thought he did. He never expressed all this desire for power, this desire for acceptance."" Ford died in 2006 at age 93. The Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation did not respond to CNN requests for comment on Fromme's release. Virga, who is still practicing in Sacramento, said he had not heard from Fromme since her sentencing in 1975. ""I wish her the best, and hope everything works out for her, and hope she stays out of trouble,"" he said. ""She needs to stay out of trouble. She's been in prison a long time ... it was, in my mind, a tragedy that she wound up a disciple of Manson.""","""Squeaky"" Fromme was convicted in 1975 of pointing a gun at then-President Ford .

"(CNN) -- In 2001, I became the first tenured female faculty member ever in Yale's physics department. Throughout my 30 years as a physicist, being the only woman in the room has been the norm. Women fill more than half of the jobs in the U.S. economy but constitute fewer than 12% of working physicists and engineers. For me and for others in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), the dearth of women is not news. What was big news last week was a study, from colleagues in other departments at Yale, explaining why this deficiency of women persists. Evidence shows that established scientists at top research universities -- those choosing and training the next generation of STEM experts -- unconsciously rate budding female scientists lower than men with identical credentials. They judge women less capable, less worthy of hiring and less deserving of mentoring. And they propose starting salaries that are on average 14% higher for men than for women. Are we really ready to take a look at 'real women'? The new study is the first to be done on STEM faculty rather than, as is more typical, college undergraduates. Hundreds of earlier studies on undergraduates established that the name on a résumé affects our perceptions. And that women and men both act with unconscious bias to privilege those who already dominate a specific field of work, whether that means preferring a man's résumé for a job in physics or a woman's for a job in nursing. When I was a young scientist, the dearth of female colleagues bothered me. So did the general lack of concern this raised in the scientific community. Occasionally, a colleague might ask why there weren't more women in physics, but their favorite hypothesis didn't hold water: that family priorities are to blame, because the years raising children often coincide with the crucial years as an assistant professor right before getting tenure. But if family considerations slowed the advancement of women, why would women without children have similar career trajectories to those with children who remained full-time in the work force? It didn't add up. I also struggled to understand why I didn't seem to belong in my field -- why I was overlooked for leadership roles, why I was underpaid, why my suggestions were ignored until a male colleague proposed the same idea and why female scientists in general garnered a disproportionately small share of honors and awards. Then I stumbled on a description about bias in Virginia Valian's eye-opening book, ""Why So Slow? The Advancement of Women."" It was a classic Eureka moment. My observations of the underappreciation of women in science were suddenly explained by a simple idea: that each of us, having grown up in a society where men and women are not equal and do not populate the peaks of accomplishment equally, has an unconscious expectation that men are leaders. Consider this riddle I heard as a kid: A man and his son are in a serious car accident. The man dies on the spot, and the son is rushed to the hospital. Upon entering the operating room, the surgeon says, ""I can't operate on this boy; he's my son."" I was utterly unable to figure out how the boy's father could both be dead and about to perform surgery. Of course, the answer is that the boy's mother was the surgeon. That possibility never crossed my young mind because, until I was in my 20s, I had never had a female doctor. So it's not surprising that I developed an unconscious expectation that doctors would be men. Opinion: Lift up women to lift the world . The social science research made all kinds of sense to me. Our experiences of life are turned into unconscious expectations that affect how we see others. When scholars reviewed a psychology research paper, for example, they scored it higher if the author's name were male than if female. A male applicant for a job as police chief was rated higher than a woman, even though she had important qualifications for the job that he lacked. Similarly, a male applicant for a job as nursing supervisor was rated lower than the female applicant, even when he had the qualifications she lacked. These experiments, which vary only the name at the top of the résumé, are repeatable. Time after time, the results are the same. Perhaps the biggest worry is that people who swear they are objective are the most likely to make biased judgments. In several classic experiments, subjects were asked which criteria are most important for a particular job and then shown two résumés: one of the ""wrong"" gender who had all those qualifications and one of the ""right"" gender who lacked them. Yet the subjects rated the person with the ""right"" gender higher, i.e. they ignored the criteria they had earlier said were most important. And this tendency was greatest among those claiming objectivity. Those who admitted at the outset that they were not objective were the least likely to shift criteria because of gender. It seems like people who are aware of the unconscious biases we all carry are less likely to make judgments influenced by that bias. You can even check out your own objectivity on a website: implicit.harvard.edu. It's a sobering experience. Mine is probably typical: I so deeply wanted to be unbiased, but while taking the online tests, I felt the impact of gender and race on my reactions. Mahzarin Banaji, the Harvard professor who started the website, says she too showed signs of bias when she took her own test. If she can admit that, perhaps the rest of us can be open to the possibility. Opinion: Why do women still lag in journalism? Objectivity is the core value in science. We are trained to be objective; to be a good scientist is to be objective. Any suggestion that a scientist is biased can be a serious insult. But as the new study tells us, despite our best hopes, we scientists, like everyone else, expect men to be better scientists than women, and we project those expectations on the real people we encounter, not consciously and not meaning to discriminate yet evaluating women below their demonstrated potential. This means most of us can't be gender-blind or color-blind or unaware of difference. That's not the goal right now. What we must do is acknowledge our inner biases and make sure we try our best to avoid them. Maybe then it will become possible for bright young women to move forward in STEM careers as easily as the men do, making discoveries, improving our lives, changing our preconceptions and reducing our unconscious biases. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Meg Urry.","A new study shows established scientists are biased against women in science .

More than 200,000 athletes take part in competitive cheerleading where high-flying stunts, powerful tumbling and tight synchronization yield winning scores in a growing network of competitions. The most prestigious event is the World Championship of All Star Cheerleading, held annually in early May. ""Like I tell everyone, it's like the Olympics of cheerleading,"" Mikayla told CNN just before her team competed in the event. ""There's just nothing that compares to the feeling of hitting a hard stunt or flipping through the air and then hearing the crowd roar when you hit it. If you experience it, it's just like the happiest feeling ever because ... they're hard skills and they're exciting skills."" Mikayla cheers for Cheer Extreme Allstars, which has six gyms in North Carolina (and one in Virginia) and more than 900 athletes in the program. Mikayla trains at one of the team's bigger facilities, in Raleigh. The team's website claims ""850 national championship titles and counting."" Cheer Extreme's large senior team won world championships in 2010. Mikayla is on a smaller team, with 20 girls (plus alternates). She wants to bring another title trophy back to Raleigh. Her training is intense, probably the most fanatical on the team. ""She is one of those kids that would be in the gym 23 hours of a 24-hour day every day if she could. It means that much to her,"" said Kelly Smith, Mikayla's coach. Mikayla writes down every workout because she said it makes her accountable and helps her train smarter. Her log has notes on all of her practices and at-home sessions since last year's world championships. ""So I've done 224 since,"" she told CNN in April. Winning over the judges in 150 seconds . The routines in competitive cheerleading, known as all-star cheerleading, are 2½ minutes of music-pumping dance and quickly executed cheerleading stunts mixed with gymnastic moves. ""It's not traditional pompom. The sole purpose of your team is to compete against others. I really can't stand pompom. I like the athletic part of it and like the stunts and tumbling, and that's what I'm really into,"" Mikayla said. Maddie Gardner, an 18-year-old member of the Cheer Extreme world championship team, cheers for her high school team, too, but said there is a huge difference between the two teams. Especially since at school, she cheers for other athletes to win, and with Cheer Extreme, she's part of the team. ""It's representing yourself and being part of something that's just so special,"" she said. And it's special to a lot of girls. Most of the girls on the top Cheer Extreme teams have their parents drive them for two hours or more from other cities to the two main practice facilities. (The other is in central North Carolina in Kernersville.) Cheer Extreme co-owner and head coach Courtney Pope said many of the girls get home from school, pack a bag, jump in the car at 4 p.m., get to practice at 6, practice until 9 (or 9:30), then head home, getting into bed about midnight. Homework is usually done in the car. One girl is from Orlando but stays with a host family in North Carolina. For many this is the pinnacle of their times as cheerleaders. Some do go on to cheer in college, a few assisted by scholarship or stipend money. Jim Chadwick, president of the United States All Star Federation -- the governing body of the sport -- said parents and kids shouldn't sink a lot of money into cheerleading hoping it leads to college grant money. The payoff comes from the friends you make and the way being a part of a team prepares you for being an adult, he said . ""People should participate in this because of the life skills you get from it,"" he said by phone. ""And if, oh by the way, you are able to get some help on a scholarship, then that's a plus."" To compete at the elite level can take $3,000 to $5,000 a year -- on level with travel soccer teams, he said. It takes commitment . Pope said the team practices every week of the year. It's just the number of sessions and the intensity of them that varies. During the summer, the kids do miss time for vacation, but the gym is open most days of the year. Pope said they even practice while schools are closed for Christmas break so the girls can maintain fitness and avoid getting hurt because they were a bit out of shape when they tried a move. And practices sometimes take up big chunks of the day -- especially for the coaches. Pope, who looks over 22 teams through the week, said on the primary practice days of Saturday and Sunday, she is at the gym for 10 to 11 hours. Each team usually puts in two  to three hours. All that time on the mat can make a mind and body weak. But Pope said that's OK. ""If you only come in and you hit when you're perfect, then you don't know how to fix things when they go wrong,"" she said. ""That's the way that we're able to, you know, maintain such a high level of, of accuracy in competition because we don't just do it when we're perfect, we do it when we're going to make a mistake, and they have to get through it anyway."" The governing body doesn't want athletes getting in over their heads so they issue guidelines to who can do what. Coaches and athletes are certified, Chadwick said. That means coaches have to have someone attest to their training. There is a written component where the coaches demonstrate they have read the rules and safety guidelines, he said. ""And there's a hands-on portion where they actually have to show our testers the proper technique for spotting various cheerleading moves and stunts,"" he said. Braces and braces . Watch a video of the Cheer Extreme team and you'll notice several girls have braces -- on their teeth and on their ankles. But Pope said the sport isn't that risky. ""We have had surprisingly few career-ending or long-term injuries,"" she said. ""We roll some ankles here and there or have some strained wrists or tendinitis and that kind of thing, but it is not superiorly dangerous by any stretch of the imagination."" Published studies on reported injuries generally focus on high school and college cheerleading, where participants often practice on hard gym floors. While admitting more can be done to keep athletes safe, all-star cheerleading advocates say they use bouncy gymnastics floors, require safety rules be followed and use plenty of spotters. They point out that while the number of injuries has increased in the past decade, the number of participants has grown even more and the cheerleading season is longer than other sports. Still year-round strain on a body and mind can lead to mishaps. Both Mikayla and Gardner had injury concerns going into the world championships. Gardner lost sleep over a mild knee injury that threatened to keep her from competing. But she said that even if she were in a cast, she would still be in the lineup ""because that's how much I care about the team and the sport."" Growth period . Chadwick said the popularity of cheerleading is stabilizing in the United States, but internationally the sport is seeing the kind of growth this country saw about 10 years ago. Pope said membership increases at Cheer Extreme by double-digit percentages each year. Many of the girls on the senior teams have been in the program for years. They have grown to be close friends, Pope said, and the challenges of cheerleading make them better people. ""I truly believe that this experience and the life lessons and the teamwork ... and all the things that are gained from being with a group of people for 10 years like this and traveling together -- the same kids, is just immeasurably important down the road,"" she said. And Gardner said that despite the long days of practice, she feels like she's not missing out on life. ""I feel like I'm experiencing an even more exciting teenaged time period because I get to do all these things that other people my age don't get to do,"" she said. ""And even though it may seem like I'm missing out on a lot of the typical activities that teenagers participate in, I get to do all of that and more because my team is like my group of friends that I get to hang out with every day."" CNN's Courtney Yager and Sandra Endo contributed to this report.","All-star cheerleading combines gymnastics, dance and cheerleading moves .

"(CNN) -- Jerry goes through test after test, only to be told he has ""chest pain."" ""Why can't my doctors tell me what's wrong?"" he says. Danielle has a headache. Her doctor orders a CAT scan and spinal tap. ""Do I really need these tests?"" she asks. We are two ER physicians who see our patients becoming increasingly frustrated at getting more tests, but fewer answers. Jerry's doctors are taught to not tell him what he has; Danielle doesn't necessarily need invasive tests, but she does need her doctor to listen to her. The skyrocketing cost of health care is in the news every day: $2.7 trillion spent on health care, 18 cents of every dollar, with up to a third of medical costs wasted. But the problem goes much deeper than cost. More than 100,000 Americans die from medical error every year, with the majority of error attributed to mistakes in diagnosis. Every day, patients are going undiagnosed or misdiagnosed despite doctors' increasing reliance on tests, a large number of which are probably unnecessary. 10 shocking medical mistakes . Patients feel increasingly out of control and out of touch with their own health. Well-intended doctors try their best, but they, too, are trapped in a dysfunctional system, which, at least on the surface, appears to reward ""cookbook medicine,"" which regards all individuals as alike, and punish good judgment. How can we move past this stalemate? We believe that patients hold the key. The patient empowerment movement has traditionally been focused on getting information to make better treatment decisions. But taking control of your health care begins with something even more fundamental: You have to advocate for getting the diagnosis right. To do this, you have to speak up and be heard, so that your doctor can hear your story and partner with you to arrive at an accurate diagnosis. The next time you are at the doctor, try our approach to building this partnership -- the 8 Pillars to Better Diagnosis: . 1. Tell your whole story. Studies have shown that more than 80% of diagnoses can be made based on history alone. Unfortunately, doctors sometimes seem to want to steer you toward a cookbook ""chief complaint"" or a series of ""yes/no"" answers. Learn to tell a succinct, effective story. Prepare and rehearse it. 2. Assert yourself in the doctor's thought process. Find out what your doctor is thinking as you recount your history, and let your doctor know what's on your mind. If you're not starting out on the same wavelength, it's hard to develop that crucial partnership. 3. Participate in your physical exam. If you're being examined, make sure you know what the doctor is looking for. Don't be afraid to ask about the implications of any findings. 4. Make a differential diagnosis together. A ""differential diagnosis"" is just the list of all the possible diagnoses that could explain your symptoms. Make sure you and your doctor come up with a thorough list, with some estimate of the likelihood of each possible diagnosis. Keep asking what else could be going on. 5. Partner in the decision-making process. Devise a strategy with your doctor for narrowing down the list of possible diagnoses. By partnering with your doctor, you can often arrive at a working diagnosis without a lot of tests. 6. Apply tests rationally. If you do need to undergo further testing, you should understand how a particular test will help narrow down your differential and what the risks and alternatives are. Look out for ""cookbook medicine,"" and make sure your doctor is tailoring an approach that works for you. 7. Use common sense. You shouldn't leave the doctor without a working diagnosis that makes sense to you. Don't just assume the doctor must be right. If the picture doesn't add up, go back to the drawing board. 8. Integrate diagnosis into the healing process. Talk through your diagnosis with your doctor and make sure you understand its predicted course. What treatment options do you have, and what risks and benefits do they carry? If your working diagnosis turns out to be wrong, what warning signs should you be on the lookout for? Our ""8 Pillars"" approach empowers patients to participate with their doctors in the diagnostic process. Opinion: Is your hospital hurting you? To be sure, doctors need to be more effective communicators, and we need a health care system that appropriately rewards partnerships with patients. But patients can't afford to wait for doctors to improve and the health care system to be reformed. Your health, and that of your loved ones, is on the line. It's up to you to take an active role and ensure that your doctor is listening. You can be, and must be, your own best advocate when it comes to partnering with your doctor and getting to the right diagnosis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Leana Wen and Dr. Joshua Kosowsky.","Patients are getting frustrated at more tests and fewer answers .

"(CNN) -- For most of American history, the average farmer, shop owner or entrepreneur could live an entire life without getting anything from the federal government except mail service. But those days have gone the way of the Pony Express. Last year, the Wall Street Journal reported that 49% of the population lives in a household where at least one person gets some type of government benefit. The Heritage Foundation's annual Index of Dependence on Government tracks government spending and creates a weighted score adjusted for inflation of federal programs that contribute to dependency. It reports that in 2010, 67.3 million Americans received either Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Social Security, support for higher education or other assistance once considered to be the responsibility of individuals, families, neighborhoods, churches, and other civil society institutions -- an 8% increase from the year before. These people aren't necessarily dependent on government; many could live (even live well) without their Social Security check, Pell grant or crop subsidy. That's not the point. The problem is that Washington is building a culture of dependency, with ever-more people relying on an ever-growing federal government to give them cash or benefits. This is a growing and dangerous trend. The United States thrives because of a culture of opportunity that encourages work and disdains relying on handouts. The growth of the welfare state, a confusing alphabet soup of programs that are supposed to help low-income Americans make ends meet and do not include entitlements such as Social Security or Medicare, is turning us into a land where many expect, and see no stigma attached to, drawing regular financial support from the federal government. Opinion: Americans are not moochers . Consider means-tested social welfare programs. The federal government operates at least 69 programs that provide assistance deliberately and exclusively to poor and lower-income people. The benefits include cash, food, housing, medical care and social services. Yet when poverty expert Robert Rector, senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, examined these anti-poverty programs, he found that only two, the earned income tax credit and the additional child refundable credit, require recipients to actually work for their benefits. It had been three, but earlier this year, the Obama administration effectively set aside the most well-known welfare work requirements, those specifically written into the 1996 Temporary Assistance to Needy Families law. The Department of Health and Human Services announced that states could apply for a waiver of the law's clearly stated work requirements. Meanwhile, although spending on welfare has been cut in half since it was reformed in 1996, other federal spending on programs, such as food stamps, has soared year after year and decade after decade. Simply put, spending on social welfare programs has exploded. CNNMoney: The poor do have jobs . Under a culture of dependency, poverty becomes a trap, and recipients get stuck. Long-term welfare recipients lose work habits and job skills and miss out on the marketplace contacts that lead to job opportunities. That's a key reason the government should require welfare recipients to work as much as they can. What could be called ""workfare"" thus tends to increase long-term earnings among potential recipients. Another problem is that we simply can't afford all this spending. The national debt is at $16 trillion, more than the entire GDP of the United States last year. High as it is, that debt is about to soar. More than 78 million baby boomers are retiring onto Social Security and Medicare in the next 15 years or so. Under Obamacare, Medicaid is set to explode as well. Within just one generation, total federal spending could reach nearly 36% of GDP, and the Congressional Budget Office says debt held by the public could reach nearly 200% of GDP. That will crowd out virtually all other government spending, including national defense. Future Congresses could impose deep cuts in social welfare programs across the board or raise massive taxes to support these exploding programs. The results would be chaotic and unpredictable. News: Romney remarks: Plain truth or huge mistake? It doesn't have to be this way. We can reduce dependency on government and focus benefits on those who are truly needy. For example, by including work requirements and promoting marriage (being raised in a married family significantly reduces a child's chances of being in poverty), we'll help rekindle the American Dream for everyone. All poverty programs should be reviewed to make certain they're helping people instead of harming them. Social welfare programs should help people up, not hold them down.

"Marianna, Florida (CNN) -- This Florida panhandle town is the home of a mystery that has been lost to time. A small cemetery buried deep into the grounds of a now-defunct boys reform school dates back to the early 1900s. Rusting white steel crosses mark the graves of 31 unidentified former students. Former students said the deaths were at the hands of abusive administrators, but a 2009 state investigation determined there was no evidence of criminal activity connected with any of the deaths or of abusive treatment. But the investigation did not clear up the mystery over the fate of 50 other students who died at the school and whose bodies have not been accounted for. In the wake of that investigation, more former students -- who are now senior citizens -- have come forward with stories of abuse at the school, including alleged beatings, killings and the disappearance of students, during the 1940s, '50s and '60s. Reform school guard, 85, denies beating boys . ""These are children who came here and died, for one reason or another, and have just been lost in the woods,"" said Dr. Erin Kimmerle, an anthropologist from the University of South Florida who is leading a scientific search on the grounds of what used to be the Florida Industrial School for Boys. Using ground-penetrating radar, Kimmerle's team has located what she says appear to be 18 more remains than previously thought to have been buried there. After clearing the area, her team has determined that a total of 49 graves exist. All are unidentified. ""We found burials within the current marked cemetery, and then we found burials that extend beyond that,"" Kimmerle said. Regarding the missing boys, ""for the majority, there's no record of what happened to them. So, they may be buried here, they may have been shipped to their families. But we don't know,"" she said. State and school records show that out of nearly 100 children who died while at the school, there are no burial records for 22 of them, according to Kimmerle. ""When there's no knowledge and no information, then people will speculate and rumors will persist or questions remain,"" she said. Kimmerle, who worked on an international forensics team that amassed evidence used in war crimes trials from the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, called the Florida project a humanitarian effort for the families of the former students and for the community. ""It's about restoring dignity,"" she said. The team laid a grid using ground-penetrating radar to create a three-dimensional digital image of the area. They had to clear underbrush and trees when it became apparent the cemetery extended well beyond the small fenced area. ""We found numerous anomalies throughout,"" said Rich Estabrook, a public archaeologist working on the team. ""Many of them tend to be in rows, and somewhat symmetrical."" The team believes these so-called ""anomalies"" are graves because they are lined up in east-west configurations, the traditional way Christians are buried. Exhumations will have to be requested by family members. Adding to the mystery, Kimmerle's team has determined, based on reports from former workers and students, that another cemetery exists on the 1,400-acre property. Those graves could contain the bodies of black students, buried in a different area because of segregation. The team has petitioned to search the area, and the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice has agreed to work with the researchers ""on how best to provide them access to the site."" But they'll have to move quickly because the state is in the process of selling the entire property. The mystery surrounding the graves first made headlines in 2008 when Florida's then-governor Charlie Crist ordered an investigation after a group of men, known as ""the White House Boys,"" came forward with stories of how they were beaten with leather straps by school administrators inside a small, white building on school property. Robert Straley, who spent about 10 months at the school in the 1960s for allegedly stealing a car, said he was taken to the ""white house"" on his very first day. ""I came out of there in shock, and when they hit you, you went down a foot into the bed, and so hard, I couldn't believe. I didn't know what they were hitting you with,"" said Straley. Former school administrator Troy Tidwell, a one-armed man who was there at the time and who some former students accused of beating them, has said in a deposition that ""spankings"" took place at the school but denied anyone was ever beaten or killed. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement's report, issued in 2009, accounted for the 31 boys buried in the cemetery. Although each individual plot cannot be identified, the report said many were killed in a 1914 fire at the facility, while others died in a 1918 flu outbreak. Two dogs and a peacock also are buried there. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement report said poorly kept school records prevented officials from determining what became of the other 50 students: whether they were buried on the grounds or sent home to their families. It said most died as a result of accidents or illness, though two were killed by other students and one was shot by a deputy sheriff trying to run away. One of those ""White House boys"" called the department's report a ""whitewash."" ""All they did was try to do their best to discredit us,"" Straley said. ""They focused on that instead of focusing on an investigation."" The department has said it stands by the integrity of its report. A Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokesman said officials could not comment on the research team's findings until they have had time to review the report. Owen Smith was among the 31 students identified as having been buried in the cemetery. ""He had no ambition to do anything but play music,"" said his sister, Ovell Smith Krell, who was 12 when her brother ran away from home in 1940. She said he was headed for Nashville to become a musician, but never made it. He was arrested in a stolen car, and sent to the reform school. He ran away from the school, but got caught, he told his sister in a letter a short time afterward. A few months later, his family got a letter from the school, notifying them that Owen had run away for a second time. ""So far, we have been unable to get any information concerning his whereabouts,"" wrote Millard Davidson, the school's superintendent at the time. ""We will appreciate your notifying us immediately if you receive any word from or concerning him,"" Davidson wrote. Owen's family decided to travel to Marianna, Florida, to find out what was going on, but just before leaving, there was a call from the school with word that Owen had been found dead. ""They think he crawled under a house to try and get warm and that he got pneumonia and died,"" said Krell, now 83. She said her mother asked that Owen's body be taken to a funeral home. The family had to borrow a car for the trip and when they arrived in Marianna two days later, school officials allegedly told them that their son was already buried. ""They said that the body was so decomposed, you wouldn't be able to identify him ... they took him straight out to the school and buried him,"" she said. Owen's classmate told the family a different story. According to his sister, the boy said as he and Owen tried to escape, ""my brother was running out across a field, an open field, and there was three men shooting at him, with rifles."" ""I believe to this day that they shot my brother that night, and I think they probably killed him and brought him back to the school and buried him,"" she said. With the completion of the anthropological search, it will be up to the families of the missing students to go to a state court to ask a judge to order exhumations. One family has already filed suit for the return of a relative's remains. Krell said she only hopes to give her brother a proper burial. ""I would take him and put him down with my mom and dad in their cemetery,"" she said. ""I hope I get that chance.""","In 2009, Florida determined that 31 boys buried at a reform school were fire, flu victims .
Today, investigators have found 18 more graves at the same site .

"(CNN) -- The fear began just after news broke Thursday that a long-range business jet with an isolation pod left the United States for Liberia, where it will evacuate two Americans infected with Ebola. Twitter exploded with questions about the deadly virus, which according to the World Health Organization is believed to have killed hundreds in four West African nations. And with reaction to news that two infected Americans would soon be on their way back to the United States. ""Why are they doing this?"" Robin Hunter asked in a post on Twitter. While U.S. officials have remained mum on the issue, a source told CNN that a medical charter flight left from Cartersville, Georgia, on Thursday evening. A CNN crew saw the plane depart shortly after 5 p.m. ET. The plane matched the description provided by the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. It was not immediately known when the two Americans -- identified by the source as Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol -- would arrive in the United States, or where the plane would land. At least one of the two will be taken to a hospital at Emory University, near the headquarters of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, hospital officials told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. The patient will be cared for in an isolation unit at the hospital that is separate from patient areas, Gupta said. With the return of Brantly and Writebol to the United States, it will be the first time that patients diagnosed with Ebola will be known to be in the country. Brantly and Writebol are described as being in stable-but-grave conditions, with both reportedly taking a turn for the worse overnight, according to statements released Thursday by the faith-based charity Samaritan's Purse. No known cure . There is no known cure or vaccine for Ebola, which the World Health Organization says is believed to have infected 1,323 people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria between March and July 27. Of those suspected cases, it is believed to have been fatal in at least 729 cases, according to the health organization. In the United States, the National Institutes of Health announced it will begin testing an experimental Ebola vaccine in people as early as September. The federal agency has been working on the vaccine over the last few years and says they've seen positive results when they tested it on primates. The NIH announcement came the same day as the CDC issued a Level 3 alert for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, warning against any nonessential travel to the region. As of now, the outbreak has been confined to West Africa. But it could spread via travel, especially since people who have Ebola may not know it; symptoms usually manifest two to 21 days. The symptoms include fever, headaches, weakness and vomiting, and at an advanced stage there is internal and external bleeding. The Eboloa outbreak is believed to be the worst in history, and even in a best-case scenario, it could take three to six months to stem the epidemic in West Africa, Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC, told reporters on Thursday. Writebol gets 'experimental serum' Both Brantly, a 33-year-old who last lived in Texas, and Writebol were caring for Ebola patients in Liberia. An experimental serum was administered to Writebol this week. Only one dose of the serum was available, and Brantly asked that it be given to his colleague, said Franklin Graham, president of Samaritan's Purse. Samaritan's Purse said it did not have any additional detail about the serum. At the same time, Brantly received a unit of blood from a 14-year-old boy who survived Ebola, the statement said. Brantly had treated the teen, it said. It was not immediately clear what doctors hoped the blood transfusion would do for Brantly. While blood transfusions have been tried before, Frieden told reporters no one really knows why some people survive and some don't. There have been questions about the the health of Brantly's wife and his children, who left for Texas prior to his diagnosis. In a statement released Thursday, Amber Brantly said she and her children ""are physically fine."" ""We had left Liberia prior to Kent's exposure to the virus,"" she said. ""I am always anxiously awaiting any news from Liberia regarding Kent's condition."" Meanwhile, Writebol's husband, David, who like his wife is with Samaritan's Purse, is near her, said their son Jeremy, who spoke with CNN's Chris Cuomo from the United States. But she is isolated from him, and he has to wear head-to-toe protective clothing similar to a hazmat suit so that he does not contract a disease that starts out with similar symptoms as a strong flu but can end in internal bleeding and death. ""Mom continues in stable condition but it's very serious, and she's still fighting,"" her son said. ""She's weak, but she's working through it."" Liberian Information Minister Lewis Brown said his country could ill afford to lose health care workers like Writebol and Brantly. ""We join the families in prayers that they can come through this and become ... shining examples that, if care is taken, one can come out of this."" Another physician in West Africa was not so fortunate; Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan fell ill early last week while overseeing Ebola treatment at a Sierra Leone hospital and died days later. Rate of infection . Ebola fears hit close to home . The rate of infection has slowed in Guinea, but it has increased in neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia. As infection accelerates, some aid groups are pulling out to protect their own. Samaritan's Purse and the missionary group Serving in Mission have recalled all nonessential personnel from Liberia. The Peace Corps announced Wednesday it is doing the same, removing its 340 volunteers from the three severely affected nations. While there are no confirmed cases, a Peace Corps spokeswoman said two volunteers came into contact with someone who ended up dying from the virus. Those Americans haven't shown signs of Ebola but are being isolated just in case. The spokeswoman said they can't return home until they get medical clearance. Meanwhile, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Sierra Leone's President Ernest Koroma both canceled trips to the United States, and Koroma declared a state of emergency. Koroma announced an action plan to tear down many barriers that international medical workers say they face while fighting disease. Sirleaf said on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that the country is in desperate need of people with expertise in treating and dealing with Ebola. Some residents in affected villages have accused medical workers of bringing the disease into the country and have barricaded their towns or otherwise blocked access to Ebola victims. Koroma said he will deploy police and military to accompany the aid workers. They will search house to house for the infirm and enforce orders designed to curb the virus' spread. American dies in Nigeria . One American, 40-year-old Patrick Sawyer, died in a Nigerian hospital earlier this month -- having come from Liberia. He was in a plane to Lagos, when he became violently ill. He was planning to go back home to Minnesota to celebrate his daughters' birthdays, but the disease took his life before he could. The Nigerian government said Thursday it has located 10 more people who had contact with Sawyer, the first American who died in the Ebola outbreak. Meanwhile, none of the 67 people under surveillance and the two people in quarantine have shown symptoms of the disease, Nigerian Minister of Information Labaran Maku said. A naturalized American citizen who worked in Liberia, Sawyer flew to Nigeria intending to attend a conference. After exhibiting symptoms upon arrival July 20, he was hospitalized and died on July 25. Nigeria's Minister of Health Onyebuchi Chukwu says the government is still searching for more people that had contact with Sawyer on his journey on a plane that stopped in Accra, Ghana and Lome, Togo, before traveling on to Lagos.

"(CNN) -- After President Lyndon Johnson signed the Gun Control Act of 1968, many anti-gun politicians looked forward to the day when they could completely ban the sale and ownership of firearms and perhaps even confiscate those already in private hands. After the draconian legislation imposed restrictions on ""dealing"" firearms that resulted in the prosecution of countless innocent gun collectors, and recordkeeping on ammunition sales so useless that federal law enforcement agencies supported their repeal, Sen. Ted Kennedy wrote to the NRA to demand our support for a national gun licensing and registration system. A few years later, a Nixon administration advisory commission proposed that all side arms be outlawed and confiscated in about a decade. That didn't happen. Those hostile to firearms ownership and the Second Amendment thought they were on the verge of victory, but had in fact managed to wake up millions of Americans who hadn't previously believed that government would ever threaten their guns or their way of life. They were joined by others who were not necessarily gun owners but believed the Second Amendment and the rights it guaranteed a free people worth preserving. Opinion: Americans, even NRA members, want gun reforms . The NRA was founded in 1871, but until the passage of the 1968 legislation had never been much involved in politics and didn't even have a lobbying office. That changed as the men and women the organization represented demanded that the NRA step up to defend their rights in the frenzy of the late 1960s. Within a few years, many of those who had so fervently believed that the public would welcome their sponsorship of ""gun control"" were defeated and before long Republicans and Democrats in Congress joined forces to pass the ""Firearms Owners Protection Act"" of 1986 that rolled back many of the restrictions adopted in 1968. Since that time, the NRA has continued to devote more than 85% of its resources to its traditional mission of providing civilian firearms training, teaching firearms safety and working to introduce new generations of Americans to the shooting sports, but has taken on the added role of protector of the right of law-abiding Americans to own and enjoy firearms. That role has become especially important as some, unfortunately, have sought to exploit December's incomprehensible murders in Newtown, Connecticut, to impose further restrictions on honest people. The organization's political strength rests on the bipartisan and diverse make-up of its membership and of the millions of nonmember firearms owners who look to the NRA for leadership and their willingness to step up to the plate and the ballot box when their rights are threatened. Opinion: Gun makers, help keep weapons out of criminals' hands . It is that second attribute of Second Amendment supporters that has surprised the president and his allies. The Obama administration has attempted to demonize the NRA and cow gun owners into accepting restrictions that they know won't make anyone safer but which will interfere with a citizen's ability to acquire, keep and rely on firearms to protect their families or participate in the shooting sports. Among those proposals are ""universal"" background checks that will never be ""universal"" because criminals won't submit to them, and magazine bans that will put the law-abiding at a disadvantage against multiple attackers. The president also backs a new ban on ""assault weapons,"" even though Christopher Koper, the researcher who studied the last ban for the Justice Department concluded that it caused ""no discernible reduction in the lethality or injuriousness of gun violence"" and did not contribute to the general drop in crime in the 1990s. But gun owners have been energized rather than cowed. They are presenting a truly united front as they rally to fight for their constitutionally guaranteed rights. Opinion: A father's murder, a plea on gun control . Anyone who doubts this need only look at what happened in the literally bankrupt city of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, last week. The organizers of the largest outdoor show in the country, the Eastern Sports and Outdoor Show, announced that they would not allow the display or presence of the firearms the president likes to demonize as assault weapons. Within days, more than 300 vendors withdrew in protest as the NRA and others urged Second Amendment supporters to boycott the event. Soon after, show organizers announced it was being postponed indefinitely. This was the largest outdoor show in the country. It draws a huge crowd every year and according to local estimates, about $80 million won't be arriving in the pockets and coffers of the pro-Bloomberg, anti-gun mayor of Harrisburg now. As the battle over restricting Second Amendment rights continues, other elected officials under pressure from the Obama administration to ignore the feelings and deep beliefs of some of their constituents will learn a similar lesson. Hundreds of self-proclaimed gun advocates didn't believe Obama was anti-gun based on his first term and wrote the NRA saying we were using scare tactics to have our way: Now they know. Opinion: Gun extremists' alternate reality . Second Amendment supporters are in no mood to give those who would deny them their rights a pass and will vote in the next election in the same united way they responded to the insult leveled at them by the organizers of the Harrisburg show.

"(CNN) -- ""Breaking Bad's"" Walter White has been off the air since late September, but his legacy is still looming over Albuquerque, New Mexico, where the series was set and filmed. Fans seeking one last goodbye to the TV character, who transformed from a milquetoast chemistry teacher into a treacherous meth kingpin over the course of five acclaimed seasons on AMC, gathered in Albuquerque on Saturday for a mock funeral. CNN affiliate KOAT said ahead of the service that the plan was to bury a ""small vault filled with memorabilia"" as fans said their goodbyes. With a eulogy given by ""Breaking Bad"" set decorator Michael Flowers and a procession led by a hearse, the show's famous banged-up RV, and a few Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department deputies, the event was attended by roughly 200 people, the Albuquerque Journal reports. The faux service, held at Albuquerque's Sunset Memorial Park, doubled as a fundraiser for Albuquerque Health Care for the Homeless, as attendees paid to participate. According to the funeral's website, $20 bought entrance to the funeral ""and a handful of earth to help bury Walter White."" Yet for some who have laid actual family members to rest at Sunset Memorial Park, the fake grave site is, at the least, a nuisance. ""It's going to be difficult to look up and see something going on over there that really shouldn't,"" resident Manuel Arellano told KOAT. ""This is too much. I bring my family here to visit their grandpa and my wife to visit her dad ... What's going to happen come Christmas, come Thanksgiving on those hard days for me and my family? It's hard to come when we miss my father-in-law so much. It's going to be hard to see people over there decorating something for somebody that wasn't real."" More than 900 people who agree with that sentiment have signed an online petition asking Sunset Memorial Park to remove the grave site, which includes a headstone. Officials at the cemetery told the Albuquerque Journal that the mock burial was in the clear as long as the cemetery could remove the grave if it became a distraction for others. ""We are a cemetery first and foremost,"" Sunset Memorial Park general manger Vaughn Hendren told the paper. ""Our allegiance lies with our families that have allowed us to bury their loved ones here."" The online petition asserts that ""the 'officials' should not put the family members through such disrespect during the process of deciding whether or not too many people are visiting the makeshift grave."" For now, it seems the petitioners have won out. According to KOAT, the AMC character's fake grave has been moved, and the headstone is not being kept at the cemetery. While fans may not always have a physical place to mourn the loss of White, who was played by Bryan Cranston, they can always hold on to the obituary. The Albuquerque Journal ran a notice about White's ""death,"" as constructed by a ""Breaking Bad"" fan group, in its October 4 paper.","Fans mourned the death of ""Breaking Bad's"" Walter White on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- It's the $199 headband that will allow you to control things using your mind, the makers say. The Muse headband was unveiled this week at LeWeb and CNN caught up with founder of Interaxon Ariel Garten for a demonstration of the brainwave-sensing headband. Garten says Muse works using the same technology used in hospitals known as Electroencephalography (EEG), which records electrical activity along the scalp. Muse is embedded with four sensors that allows you to see and track your brain's activity, in the same way a heart rate monitor gives information about your physical activity. You can also use your mind to control games and applications supplied with the headband, Garten says. ""It interacts with content directly with your mind so you can play games that you are able to control with your mind,"" says the Canadian neuroscientist and entrepreneur. Connecting to any device such as a smartphone, tablet or laptop via bluetooth, Muse can be worn on the go and includes a ""brain fitness suite"" app that tracks the state of your brain or can help you de-stress. She adds: ""And as you play the games, you are working with and strengthening your mind. The most important thing is that it can help you improve your cognitive and emotional function, it shows you your brain activity and gives you targeted exercises to improve both cognitive and emotional functioning."" Muse will help with improving brain function, power and memory in the same way Sudoku and crosswords do presently, explains Garten. ""But they are doing that on an indirect level, we are moving it one scale up with Muse,"" she says. LeBlog: Discover all the action from LeWeb on CNN . Garten first talked about the concept of thought-controlled computer technology at LeWeb two years ago. Since then she has raised nearly double the $150,000 she sought on the Indiegogo crowd-funding website. ""Research labs have been using this tech for years, now its time to bring all this understanding and improvements to the consumer, taking it from the labs to your inbox,"" she says. ""The most important part of ourselves is the mind and it has been rather inaccessible. This is a tool that helps unlock the mind in really exciting ways. People seem pretty excited,"" she adds. ""There hasn't been a person I've spoken to who hasn't wanted one."" I confess to being excited too as I slipped on the lightweight and sleek-looking headband which rests on the forehead and tucks behind the ears, like a pair of glasses. Muse was connected to a laptop and felt comfortable as I got ready to try out a special demo application called EmoType, a mood-based text editor that changes fonts depending on your brainwave activity. It felt strange watching my brain in real-time on the screen in front of me as Garten asked me to blink and showed me how the action impacted my brainwaves. More from LeWeb: Cyborg anthropologist: We can all be superhuman . Then she asked me to type something. ""I miss my daughter,"" I wrote and was surprised to see the font suddenly change to a more flowery style as I typed out daughter. Ariel explained that as I focused on what to type in the beginning, the text was clean and tight and as I became more open and relaxed the text appeared more flowery. When someone is smiling, the letters will suddenly appear very big, she explained. Undoubtedly, EmoType, though only a demo at present, has huge implications for new ways of communication in the real and virtual world in the future. Developers will be excited at the possibility of creating applications that could perhaps be used to convey information through avatars. Could it be the end of the exclamation mark? Muse is available to buy on the Indiegogo website until December 7 for early adopters and after that, will be available again in June 2013, when they start shipping. Are you excited about Muse? Will you be buying it? Let us know in the comments.","$200 Muse headband reads brainwaves and allows you to to play smartphone games with your mind .

"(CNN) -- The 24-year-old man accused of attacking commuters while naked at a San Francisco subway station proclaimed he is not guilty Tuesday. According to the San Francisco District Attorney's office, Yeiner Garizabalo waived his arraignment and entered not guilty pleas. He is due back in court on July 18 for a pre-hearing conference. The native of Colombia remains in jail on a $100,000 bond and a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. Garizabalo faces seven charges following the May 10 incident at a Bay Area Rapid Transit station. He appeared in a bizarre video where he, sans clothing, performed acrobatics off subway equipment, then went after commuters trying to catch a train. A video of the incident quickly went viral. In it, a glistening man with a wild mane of hair turns fare gates into balance beams, doing splits and back flips buck-naked. Startled commuters flee as he dashes across the station, attacking people at random. Last week, police said he had been arrested, given a mental evaluation, charged with battery and released. He now stands accused of two felony counts of false imprisonment, four misdemeanor counts of battery and one misdemeanor count of sexual battery in the incident, said Alex Bastian, a spokesman for the District Attorney's office. California defines false imprisonment as ""the unlawful violation of the personal liberty of another."" Garizabalo, who is also known as Yeiner Perez, was, until recently, a member of the ClownSnotBombs Circus. The group posted a statement on its Facebook page Monday saying he was no longer affiliated with it. ""To our knowledge, Mr. Perez never exhibited this type of behavior previously and this episode came as a complete surprise to us,"" it said. On Tuesday, the group added another statement that said it had worked with Garizabalo to have him admitted to a hospital for a psychiatric and medical examination. That was supposed to happen Tuesday, but he was arrested on Monday. The post, signed by six members of the troupe, said Garizabalo described to them being in a play at the train station on May 10. ""Now that he has seen the video and understands the gravity of what really happened, he feels both guilty and horrible for what he has done,"" it said. ""He is extremely depressed, under a lot of stress and very afraid."" CNN affiliate KTVU reported Garizabalo faces deportation because of an expired visa.","NEW: Clown troupe says Yeiner Garizabalo told them he thought he was in a play .

"New York (CNN) -- A heroin processing location holding $8 million worth of the drug was busted in New York, along with drug paraphernalia stamped with brands such as ""NFL"" and ""government shutdown,"" authorities said Friday. A raid, which involved the DEA's New York Drug Enforcement Task Force, New York City police, and New York State Police, netted 33 pounds of heroin at a Bronx apartment that served as a ""high-volume heroin packaging location,"" according to a statement from New York's Special Narcotics Prosecutor's Office. The bust was the product of a surveillance operation in the Williamsbridge section of the Bronx on Thursday night, authorities said. Cristino Then, 25, was arrested after officers observed him delivering a package to the residence, the statement said. He was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree. Shortly after Then was picked up, another suspect, Augustin Rivera, was seen climbing out of a fifth-floor window of the same residence, the statement said. He was arrested on the same charges as Then. Both men were to be arraigned later Friday. Bags of heroin labeled 'Obama Care' seized . Police entered the residence through a fire escape on the fifth floor, the statement said. They seized the heroin and drug paraphernalia, including 18 coffee grinders, rubber bands, baking soda, face masks, and ""hundreds of thousands of individual 'glassine' bags stamped with numerous ""brand names"" including 'NFL,' 'Government Shutdown,' 'iPhone,' and 'Olympics 2012,'"" the statement said. Law enforcement officials said coffee grinders are typically used in heroin processing to cut the pure substance with a diluting agent such as baking soda. Heroin laced with dangerous substances such as fentanyl, a painkiller used by cancer patients, in recent weeks resulted at least 22 deaths from overdoses in Pennsylvania. In New York, the Nassau County Medical Examiner's Office was investigating several deaths linked to heroin laced with fentanyl, Nassau County police said in a statement Friday. Evidence from two of cases was analyzed and determined to contain fentanyl in combination with the banned compound antipyretic metamizole. Metamizole is an analgesic, and antipyretic is a fever reducer that is similar in use to ibuprofen, the statement said. The glassine packets in which the heroin was packed were stamped as ""24K"" in red ink. Referring to the bust in the Bronx, Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan said in a statement: ""A seizure of this size should open everyone's eyes to the magnitude of the heroin problem confronting us. We've heard from public officials throughout the Northeast of soaring addiction within their own localities."" She added, ""The brand names used are tied to upcoming events, indicating the savvy and sophistication of the heroin distribution ring."" McDonald's worker's Happy Meals came with an extra: Heroin .

"(CNN) -- Leave it to Jim Carrey to turn a commencement speech into a show and tell. The actor brought along some of his artwork to share Saturday with the graduates of the Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa. And the actor offered the Class of 2014 inspiring words about life and their future. ""Like many of you, I was concerned about going out into the world and doing something bigger than myself, until someone smarter than myself made me realize that there is nothing bigger than myself,"" the ""Dumb and Dumber"" star said. ""My soul is not contained within the limits of my body; my body is contained within the limitlessness of my soul."" The funnyman got serious when discussing his father and the things he learned from him. ""My father could have been a great comedian, but he didn't believe that that was possible for him, and so he made a conservative choice,"" Carrey said. ""Instead he got a safe job as an accountant."" All of that fell apart, the actor said, when his dad lost his job and the family fell on hard times. ""I learned many great lessons from my father, not the least of which, was that you can fail at what you don't want, so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love,"" he said. The speech received a rousing reaction from the graduating students of the institution, which according to its website is a place where ""all students and faculty ... practice the Transcendental MeditationÂ® technique."" Carrey jokingly thanked, ""The trustees, the administrators, the faculty of MUM for creating an institution worthy of Maharishi's ideals of education as well as enabling the students through transcendental meditation and ancient vedic knowledge to slack off twice a day for an hour and a half."" He also received an honorary degree of doctor of fine arts during the ceremony.","Jim Carrey addresses Class of 2014 at the Maharishi University of Management .

"(CNN) -- Danish cuisine reigns supreme, according to some of the planet's most prominent eaters. S. Pellegrino's annual ""World's 50 Best Restaurants"" list was released on Monday at a celebrity-chef-studded event in London, England, marking the ninth edition of the much buzzed-about (and hotly debated) catalogue of the international culinary landscape. The No. 1 spot goes to Noma in Copenhagen, Denmark. The restaurant, helmed by chef René Redzepi, ranked No. 3 in 2009. The Guardian newspaper's restaurant critic Jay Rayner -- better known to U.S. food fans as a judge on ""Top Chef Masters"" -- agrees with the judges' decision. Writes Rayner on The Guardian's food blog, ""Is that the right result? Allowing for the fact that I think the rankings are far less interesting than the list itself, I would say, yes.""  ""Redzepi, the 32-year-old chef at Noma, pursues a regional, seasonal agenda that is right on the cutting edge: if it isn't available in the Nordic region, he won't cook with it,"" he continued. ""The result is a very idiosyncratic style of food that speaks to concerns about the way a global food culture turns our eating experiences a uniform beige."" Noma's ascension to the top slot ends the reign of a culinary titan. After four consecutive years ranked as the World's Best Restaurant, Spanish restaurant El Bulli takes a seat at No. 2. However, that won't make it any easier to snag a table. Only 8,000 reservations are accepted every year, out of a reported million requests. The dethroning of Catalonia's culinary king, Ferran Adrià, comes after his announcement of plans to close the Mecca of molecular gastronomy for two years in December 2011. In 2014, the restaurant will reopen as a nonprofit foundation -- ""a think tank of gastronomic creativity"" for 20 to 25 young chefs. Despite the second-place finish, Adrià was still awarded Restaurant Magazine's Chef of the Decade honor. The illustrious list is compiled by The World's 50 Best Restaurants Academy -- an 806-member panel of the globe's most venerated chefs, food critics, restaurateurs and gourmands. ""The list creates tremendous debate -- and it's meant to,"" according to the World's 50 Best release. Eight of the restaurants crowned this year -- Alinea in Chicago, Illinois; Daniel, Per Se, Le Bernardin, Momofuku Ssäm Bar, wd~50 and Eleven Madison Park in New York; and The French Laundry in Yountville, California -- are in the United States, this year's most honored country.

"(CNN) -- If your Christmas is too often one of tacky decorations, over-cooked turkey and bitter family feuds, now may be the time to put the baubles back in the attic and plan yourself a yuletide getaway. To help you along, we offer our top picks for the most Christmassy places around the world. Lapland, Finland . While legends dating as far back as the 1820's may cite the North Pole as the official home of Santa Claus and his jolly missus, Finns would have us believe otherwise. For them, Rovaniemi, Lapland, located just north of the Arctic Circle, is Christmas headquarters. Here, children can make gingerbread cookies with Mrs. Claus, enroll in Elf School, or take a calligraphy class and learn to compose their Christmas wish-lists with a traditional quill. Other area attractions include the Ranua Zoo -- home to baby polar bears, wolverines, and moose; Sirmakko reindeer farm, where visitors can take a sled-led reindeer safari; and the Arktikum, a science center where the mystery and the magic of the Northern Lights is revealed. Those in search of a truly frosty experience can stay in the Arctic Snow Hotel, made entirely of snow and ice, but equipped with saunas and hot tubs in which to thaw. Send us your best festive images . Strasbourg, France . Strasbourg's series of themed Christmas villages morph the city into a visual and gastronomic wonderland. Hedonists can head to the Village of Alsace Farmhouse to taste prune, apricot, and other holiday-inspired variations of farm-fresh foie gras. The nearby Village of Bredle is supplied aplenty with its namesake traditional Christmas biscuits and copious amounts of mulled Alsatian wine to wash them down with. From the Strasbourg Philharmonic, to gospel, to Django-Reinhardt inspired gypsy jazz, Strasbourg's Christmas program is packed with concerts and a special selection of cultural events from Georgia, the guest country of Strasbourg's Christmas celebrations this year. Quebec, Canada . If you're the type of person who likes to celebrate Christmas around a tree made from recycled sheet metal, with lights powered by the pedaling of nearby cyclists, then Quebec is your destination. A haven for environmentally friendly, outdoor enthusiasts, the city bustles with activity, offering a holiday program for all tastes. Modern-day Victorians can enjoy a candle-lit evening of stories from Charles Dickens, detailing the Christmas traditions of yore. Sausage and roast chestnut lovers can browse the wares at the German Christmas market, and the more religiously inclined can wander exposition of nativity scenes from around the world. The nearby Sentier des Caps de Charlevoix offers family-friendly hiking, snowshoeing and skiing, while speed devils can spend the day zooming around in a snowmobile from Nord Expe, Inc. What do you know about quirky Christmas traditions? San Miguel de Allende, Mexico . Piñatas, posadas and ponche sum up the festivities in this colorful Mexican city, where Christmas is both a solemn and a celebratory affair. Leading up to December 24, you're likely to stumble upon Mary and Joseph strolling the streets, as locals make pilgrimages from home to home, singing to ""ask for posada"" or ""beg for shelter"" as they re-enact the journey to Bethlehem. Ponche - a mulled fruit drink - and piñatas cap a long evening of peregrinations around this cobblestoned city, which was recently designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its wealth of grand churches, well-preserved architecture, and grand zocalos, or sweeping public squares, replete with romance and old world charm. Dyker Heights, Brooklyn . Yes, New York City has The Rockettes, the 5th Avenue windows and, the ice rink at Rockefeller Center, all which make it a terrific, tinsel-studded holiday destination. The more curious, however, should venture out to Brooklyn for a slightly more off the cuff, yet equally ostentatious gander at how New Yorkers do Christmas. The proudly and predominantly Italian-American residents from roughly 11th to 13th Avenue and from 83rd to 86th Street have an unspoken agreement to one-up each other with holiday decorations which, much to the mirth of passersby, often results in two-story Santas, armies of 30-foot wooden soldiers, over-sized animatronic toys, motorized carousels, and enough nutcrackers to make Tchaikovsky twinkle with delight. Wander this winter wonderland on your own, or with a tour organized by long-time resident, Tony Muia, which includes a cannoli and a hot chocolate from a Brooklyn bakery. Lalibela, Ethiopia . Roughly 200 miles north of Addis Ababa is Lalibela; a small old town of 20,000 residents which is home to 11 monolithic churches. Dating as far back as the 12th century and carved out of striking red-color blocks of volcanic rock, the churches have been excavated from under the ground, and are connected by a complex and sometimes claustrophobic network of tunnels and passageways. Declared a ""new Jerusalem"" after the real Jerusalem was captured by Muslim forces in 1187 and Ethiopian Christians could no longer go there, Lalibela remains a very religious place. Coptic Christmas (January 7) mass at Bet Medhane Alem - the largest monolithic church in the world - is an occasion on which hundreds of priests in white turbans, adorned with red sashes and gold scarves chant, sway, and pray, surrounded by trenches flooded with some 50,000 worshipers, for whom this is a sacred place of pilgrimage. See also: Five real life winter wonderlands . Barcelona, Spain . If you can manage to extend your Christmas holiday until Three King's Day, (January 6) there is no better place to catch up with Melchior, Gaspar and Balthasar than Barcelona. On the evening of January 5, they arrive at the city's port on the the Santa Eulàlia - their very own ship - in bearded and velvet robed splendor. Canons are fired, fireworks are set off, and as the mayor hands them the keys to the city, the magic of the Magi officially commences. They parade through the streets in a magnificent cavalcade of floats which includes camels, elephants, giraffes, and dazzling costumes . Manila, Philippines . Though spending Christmas on a beach may sound like bliss, sipping an endless supply of cocktails in the sand may soon feel like it's lacking in holiday spirit. A trip to the Philippines lets you have it all. Known as the country with ""the longest Christmas season in the world,"" Filipinos get the Christmas festivities rolling in September, and extend them well through January. As the only Asian country with a predominantly Christian population, its cities and islands are festooned with nativities, lantern parades, and Christmas bazaars. While the Chocolate Hills of Bohol or the beaches of Boracay may prove a more relaxing option, spend at least a day in the capital, where this December, the Manila Hotel is turning its Grand Lobby into a fairytale worthy of Clara and Fritz. Soak up your share of sugar plum fairies, gingerbread clocks and weekend performances of The Nutcracker by Prima Ballerina Lisa Macuja-Elizalde, before escaping to the sun. See also: The Philippines shows the world how to celebrate Christmas . Queenstown, New Zealand . The traditional Christmas colors of red, green and white take on an entirely new meaning in New Zealand, where red represents the ""pohutukawa"" (New Zealand's ruby-red flowering Christmas tree), white represents the pristine sandy beaches, and green? The kiwi, of course! Sun-lovers who want to join Santa in his surf shorts should definitely head to Queenstown, where warm summer temperatures mean you can jetboat, river surf, or paraglide on Lake Wakatipu, or simply set up camp along the lakefront and enjoy a hearty Christmas meal of lamb, seafood, and chicken on the barbie.","CNN picks ten top destinations in which to spend Christmas around the world .

"Washington (CNN) -- Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, one of Obamacare's architects and staunchest supporters, is also the only top congressional leader to exempt some of his staff from having to buy insurance through the law's new exchanges. Reid is the exception among the other top congressional leaders. GOP House Speaker John Boehner, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell have all directed their staffs to join the exchange, their aides said. After website woes, President pushes benefits of Obamacare . In the charged atmosphere surrounding Obamacare, Reid's decision only gives Republicans more ammo to attack Democrats already suffering politically from the law's botched rollout. In September, Reid told reporters, ""Let's stop these really juvenile political games -- the one dealing with health care for senators and House members and our staff. We are going to be part of exchanges, that's what the law says and we'll be part of that."" With website deadline met, Obamacare scrutiny increases . That's true. Reid and his personal staff will buy insurance through the exchange. But it's also true that the law lets lawmakers decide if their committee and leadership staffers hold on to their federal employee insurance plans, an option Reid has exercised. Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson emphasized, ""We are just following the law."" Insurers still reporting errors on Obamacare applications . But Republicans are already taking aim. ""I'm sure that regular Americans who just lost their insurance will feel comforted to know that Senator Reid's staff gets to keep their government plan,"" a senior GOP Senate aide said. Former Reid staffer Jim Manley defended his old boss, arguing that ""the only people hypocritical here are Republicans, who made this an issue in the first place."" And all four House and Senate leaders are required to relinquish their federal employee insurance plans next year and are choosing to enroll in the exchanges. CNN's Lisa Desjardins contributed to this report .","Other congressional leaders have instructed their staffs to enroll .
In September, Reid said, ""We are going to be part of exchanges""

"(CNN) -- There are fears of Russians and it is October, but it's not a Tom Clancy novel. It is a case of international naval intrigue off the Swedish coast that brings back memories of the Cold War. The Swedish military on Monday intensified a search in the ocean off Stockholm for an underwater mystery vessel, but stopped short of calling it a submarine. Civilian vessels were ordered to stay at least six miles (about 10 kilometers) away from the Swedish warship conducting the search, the English-language website The Local reported. The search began Thursday after Swedish intelligence picked up an emergency radio call in Russian, reported The Local, citing the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. The radio transmissions were being sent to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, 330 miles (530 kilometers) south of Stockholm on the Baltic's southern shore, according to The Local report. There were also reports that a foreign vessel was spotted in the waters near Stockholm. Russia on Sunday denied it has any vessel in Swedish waters. Moscow suggested the vessel may belong to the Netherlands and have been involved in naval exercises off Sweden, according to a report from Russia's Itar-TASS news agency. The Dutch were quick to respond, saying a sub involved in the exercises was anchored in Tallinn harbor of NATO-ally Estonia for the weekend, according to a report from Agence France-Presse. 'We have good stamina' On Monday, the Swedish military vowed to continue searching at least for the next few days, according to The Local. ""We have good stamina,"" The Local quoted defense spokesman Dag Enander. ""We're using the sensors we have and are searching both from land and water,"" Enander was quoted as saying. To confuse matters even more, the Swedish military said Monday that it purposely provided incorrect information on Sunday about where the mystery vessel was sighted to keep the search area secure. U.S. officials told CNN there are no U.S. submarines or surface ships in the immediate area. U.S. intelligence doesn't know of any Russian assets in that area, the officials said. All the activity begs the question, why would a Russian sub need to snoop around in Swedish waters anyway? Johan Wiktorin of the Swedish Royal Academy of War Sciences gave three possibilities to The Local: . ""They could be mapping the waters in order to be able to navigate them in the event of hostilities,"" Wiktorin is quoted as saying. ""They could also be installing equipment, like sensors, that could track or get an observation of our units in that area,"" he goes on. ""Or they could also possibly reconnoiter our (defense) systems."" Russian military around the world . Whether there is a Russian sub in Swedish waters or not, there is no question that Russian forces have been active in the Baltic and around the globe this year. In fact, the Swedish military said Sunday that it has monitored suspicious activity for several years, according to another report in The Local. In July, a U.S. Air Force reconnaissance plane fled into Swedish airspace after the Russians took the unusual action of beginning to track it with land-based radar. The Russians then sent at least one fighter jet into the sky to intercept the U.S. aircraft. And on April 23, a Russian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet buzzed within 100 feet of the nose of a U.S. Air Force RC-135U reconnaissance plane over the Sea of Okhotsk between Russia and Japan, a Defense Department official said. Also on April 23, Dutch fighter jets scrambled to intercept a pair of Russian Tu-95 Bear bombers that entered a half-mile into Netherlands airspace. On June 4, according to U.S. defense officials, four long-range Russian Tu-95 bombers, accompanied by an aerial refueling tanker, flew into the U.S. Air Defense Identification Zone, an area extending 200 miles (320 kilometers) from the North American coast, off Alaska, where they were intercepted by U.S. F-22 fighter jets. Two of the Russian bombers peeled off and headed west, while the other two flew south and were identified by U.S. F-15 fighters within 50 miles of the California coast. And last month, two Alaskan-based U.S. Air Force F-22 fighter jets intercepted two Russian IL-78 refueling tankers, two Russian MiG-31 fighter jets and two Russian Bear long-range bombers, according to Capt. Jeff Davis of the North American Aerospace Defense Command. More than six hours later, two Canadian CF-18 fighter jets intercepted two Russian bombers in the Beaufort Sea, Davis said. Those Russian planes came within about 40 nautical miles of the Canadian coastline, he said. Earlier this year, a top U.S. Air Force general said Russia was stepping up its military activities in the Asia-Pacific region as tensions increased over Ukraine and Russia's move into Crimea.","Emergency radio call picked up by Swedish military, report says .

"(CNN) -- It was one of the most unexpected announcements of the year. In April, Archie Comics released the news that its lead character, Archie Andrews, would die in an upcoming issue of ""Life With Archie."" The story won't affect the overall Archie storylines, as ""Life With Archie"" takes place in an alternate timeline. Still, the visual of Archie having been gunned down was quite a shock to fans. With the issue, ""Life With Archie"" No. 36, coming out today, we now know more details about how Archie dies (spoiler alert, of course!). Kevin Keller, the first openly gay character in Archie Comics history, is a senator in the ""Life With Archie"" universe, and he's in favor of gun control. An attempt is made on Keller's life, and Archie takes the bullet for his friend. ""Archie died as he lived -- a hero, representing the best in all of us,"" Archie Comics CEO Jon Goldwater said in a news release. Goldwater spoke to CNN in April, when the news was broken. CNN: Can you explain the ""Life With Archie"" series for the uninitiated? Jon Goldwater: ""Life With Archie"" is Archie's future. It gives readers a look into what his life would be like after high school and college, which has never really been explored. Most fans are familiar with Archie as a high schooler, hanging out at Pop's Chocklit Shoppe with his friends. ""Life With Archie"" shows what happens when Archie becomes an adult and starts dealing with grown-up issues. Each issue is normally split into two storylines, one telling a tale of Archie married to Veronica, another with him ending up with Betty. The final issue, however, will show readers Archie's final fate in both timelines -- and they're the same. CNN: Why kill Archie? Goldwater: I think it's the natural conclusion to the ""Life With Archie"" series. Archie dies as he lived: heroically. He dies saving the life of a friend and does it in his usual selfless way. Archie has always been a representation of us -- the best of us. Our strengths and our faults. Writer Paul Kupperberg, with input from myself, has crafted an emotional, impactful and classic story that I know will survive the test of time. This isn't a random one-off or ""what-if"" story that we're doing as a gag. This is the story that we mapped out carefully and with much thought. This is the death of Archie as we see it, and we're treating it with that same level of gravitas and import. It's a once-in-a-lifetime event, and we are being very considerate about it. CNN: What are you hoping to accomplish with this storyline? Goldwater: First and foremost, like with anything we do at Archie, we want to tell a great, memorable story. That being said, this story in particular is of the utmost importance to us as a company and as a keeper of the Archie brand. We want to not only show how Archie's life ends but also what he means to the world around him. We want to celebrate his life. After the events of ""Life With Archie"" No. 36, fans will leap forward a year to see the aftermath and how his friends have moved on since his surprising death. What's Jughead doing? How are Betty and Veronica dealing with the loss? It's not about the attention-grab of the death but about telling a great, evocative story that reminds people why this character is important to the fabric of pop culture -- and showing how heroic a normal guy like Archie can be and how important it is to realize that. This isn't a story we're going to retcon a few weeks from now. This happened. This is the conclusion to the ""Life With Archie"" story and timeline, and it will allow us as a company and the world to take a moment to look at Archie's life as a whole and recognize him as one of the most important characters, not in just comics but in popular culture. We want people to feel the same emotional roller coaster we felt putting this story together -- to feel the range of emotions, from happiness, sadness, anger, joy and pride. We want people to react to this in a strong way because Archie is so important to them. CNN: How do you hope fans will react, ultimately? Goldwater: We expect some level of shock, outrage and surprise, followed by understanding. As a company, we are not afraid to take risks. We're not scared to shake things up to draw attention to the great stories we're building here at Archie. I hope fans will be intrigued by this news, pick up the issues in July and realize they've been given one of the best comics on the stands. They'll be handed a piece of comic book history, featuring some of the most well-known characters in the world saying goodbye to an icon. We want fans to talk about this for years to come. We think this story is bigger than anything we've ever done. It's bold, dramatic and best of all, a fitting end to the life of Archie. CNN: What do you think Archie Comics has been doing by shaking things up over the recent years? Goldwater: We're a sleeping giant. Years ago, before I stepped in as CEO, Archie was seen as a dormant, nostalgia brand stuck in amber. We were in suspended animation. People thought the stories were still set in the '50s! Now, while the characters -- like Betty, Archie, Veronica, Jughead and Reggie -- are at their core the same, Riverdale has changed. It's caught up with the times. The town of Riverdale you read about now is like any other in America. It's diverse, it's not problem-free, and it represents America in an honest way. Archie is about being welcoming, diverse and entertaining. We've managed to strike that balance in our storytelling for the last five years and managed to not only get attention but keep people entertained. From the introduction of Kevin Keller, the first regular gay character in comics, to now, the death of Archie, we've not been afraid to take risks. The big thing is, though, our risks pay off because the stories, art and execution are spot-on. We back up what we say. CNN: What will be the long-term impact of this story? Goldwater: Well, this is the end. This is how Archie dies in the pages of ""Life With Archie."" We will not be retconning, reversing or backtracking on this story in terms of ""Life With Archie."" The main Archie line, however, telling stories of Archie in high school, will continue. ""Afterlife With Archie"" (the ""Archie"" zombie series) will continue, and we will keep on taking risks with different and new interpretations of our characters. But as far as we see it, this is how Archie dies. That's how we approached this story and how we're treating it.","Archie Andrews dies in the current issue of ""Life With Archie""

"(CNN) -- Neil Harbisson is the world's first legally recognized cyborg. He has an antenna implanted into his skull that gives him access to something he was born without: the ability to perceive color. In a world where technology is overwhelming our mental focus and social lives, Harbisson, 32, has a closer relationship with technology than even the most avid smartphone user. As a child growing up in a coastal town in Catalonia, Spain, Harbisson was diagnosed with achromatopsia, complete color-blindness. In 2004, he decided to find a way out of his black-and-white world, by developing a technology that would provide him with a sensory experience that no other human had ever experienced. The idea came while studying experimental music composition at Dartington College of Arts in Devon, England. For his final project, Harbisson and the computer scientist Adam Montandon developed the first incarnation of what they called the ""eyeborg."" The apparatus was an antenna attached to a five-kilogram computer and a pair of headphones. The webcam at the end of the antenna translated each color into 360 different sound waves that Harbisson could listen to through headphones. Although it sounds like a form of induced synaesthesia, a neurological condition that makes people see or even taste colors, Harbisson's new condition is different, and requires a completely new name: sonochromatopsia, an extra sense that connects colors with sound. Unlike synaestehsia, which can vary wildly from person to person, sonochromatopsia makes each color correspond to a specific sound. It took about five weeks to get over the headaches from the sounds of each new color and about five months to be able to decipher each frequency as a particular color he could now hear as a sound. In the years after he began wearing the eyeborg, Harbisson went from complete color-blindness to the ability to decipher colors like red, green and blue. He could even detect colors like infrared and ultraviolet, which are outside of the spectrum of human vision. Going to a supermarket became like a visit to a nightclub. His daily choice of clothes began to reflect the scale of music tones that matched his emotional state, the way that some people match a top and pants. When he was in a good mood, Harbisson would dress in a chord like c-major, colors whose sound frequencies correspond to pink, yellow and blue; if he was in a sad mood, he would dress in turquoise, purple and orange, colors linked to b-minor. His concept of race also changed: he soon discovered that skin color, for him, was not actually black-and-white: . ""I thought black people were black, but they're not. They're very very dark orange and people who say they're white are very very light orange,"" Harbisson explains. The next step was to find a way to make the antenna less bulky. He began by reducing the weight of the computer to one kilo and strapping it inside his clothes. Then the computer's software was downsized into a chip installed under his skin. And this past December, Harbisson had the antenna installed directly into his skull. Finding a doctor to do the operation was not easy. He presented his case to plastic surgeons, and then to over a dozen physicians. Each one turned him down. He finally found one who agreed to do it if his identity remained confidential. It took months for the bone and the antenna to fuse, but Harbisson says he achieved exactly what he wanted. ""I don't feel any weight, I don't feel any pressure,"" he says, grasping the slender neck of the antenna. ""It just feels like touching an extension of my body. It feels like a new body part like a nose or a finger."" Cyborgism, of which Harbisson is one of the foremost pioneers, is a slowly growing trend. The development of Google Glass has brought more attention to the concept of wearing technology for extended periods of time. Magnetic implants that allow individuals to feel the attraction of magnetic fields, like microwaves or power cord transformers, have become a popular piece of equipment among self-described ""bio-hackers."" And more recently, a Canadian filmmaker developed and implanted his own kind of eyeborg, a prosthetic eye embedded with a video camera. But Harbisson says he holds the distinction of being the first cyborg to be legally recognized by a government: the photo on his UK passport shows him wearing his device, effectively sanctioning it as part of his face. He thinks the movement needs more momentum: ""I thought that after a few years this would be really mainstream, that many people would start extending their senses, but it's still not the case."" For that he blames societal pressure, pointing to an anti-cyborg organization called ""Stop the Cyborgs"" that specifically targets those who use wearable technology like Google Glass or the Narrative Clip, an automatic, wearable camera that captures your life. ""People are afraid of the unknown. They tend to exaggerate or be very negative about the possible consequences of what is new to them."" For Harbisson, physically acclimating to the technology was the easy part. Acceptance from others has been the real challenge. He frequently compares the obstacles he faces on a daily basis to what transsexuals and transvestites experienced half a century ago. In an effort to address some of these issues, Harbisson co-founded the Cyborg Foundation in 2010 with his childhood friend Moon Ribas. He asserts he's not doing anything unnatural: ""Hearing through bone conduction is something that dolphins do, an antenna is something that many insects have, and knowing where North is is something that sharks can also detect. These senses are very natural, they already exist but we can now apply them to humans."" One way in which the foundation is trying to show people what it's like to be a cyborg is through the Eyeborg app for Android, which translates colors into the sound frequencies that Harbisson hears. He sees the app as a first step toward introducing people to the cyborg experience: ""We all have a mobile phone and we all use technology constantly, so this has become normal. It will also become normal to have tech inside our bodies or have it implanted. I think it just needs time."" Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: .

"(CNN) -- Twenty years ago, singer/songwriter Cassandra Wilson signed a lucrative recording deal with Blue Note Records and subsequently released her seminal recording ""Blue Light 'til Dawn."" The critically acclaimed work led Time magazine to proclaim her ""America's Best Singer."" ""I was shocked because I've always thought Aretha Franklin was America's best singer,"" the two-time Grammy winner recently told CNN from her home in Jackson, Mississippi. ""Now if I was to vote on that, I would still say it's Aretha Franklin."" As modest as she's being, the blond, dreadlock-coiffed song stylist is, indeed, in a league of her own. Nine albums (seven solo studio recordings) by Wilson have been released on the storied record label since then, she's remained an in-demand concert headliner globally, and she shares in the Pulitzer Prize-winning glory of fellow Delta native and jazz great Wynton Marsalis for the 1997 jazz oratorio ""Blood On The Fields."" But that was then and this is now. Shortly after releasing her 2010 opus, ""Silver Pony,"" Wilson and her longtime label parted ways. This week her latest, ""Another Country""-- a guitar-laden collection of music -- was released through her own record label, Ojah Media Group, via eOne. From a creative and business standpoint, it's quite a departure from what she's grown accustomed to. ""I'm sure you're aware of all the stuff that Blue Note had been going through and switching owners,"" Wilson said. ""All of this speculation of what was going to happen, so it was time for me to make that move."" ""I think the independent way is much more flexible,"" she added. ""I was lucky to find (eOne honcho) Chuck Mitchell because he's the same kind of record industry man as (Blue Note's Chairman Emeritus) Bruce Lundvall. I've talked at length with Bruce about this decision and he gave me his blessing, he said Chuck was a great guy. And when I sat down and talked with him, I got the same feeling. So I feel very fortunate."" ""Another Country"" is not a country/western hybrid in the vein of what Lionel Richie's ""Tuskegee,"" from earlier this year. It literally was recorded in another country -- Italy. ""That was the first time that I recorded in Europe,"" Wilson shared. ""We decided that it made sense and that it was cost-effective to record in Italy because I was already over there and just finished up a tour. We were able to do it fairly easily. And we got these apartments on The Piazza della Signoria (in Florence) and we were there for 10 days and it was absolutely exquisite."" The project reunited her with producer Fabrizio Sotti, with whom she worked with on ""Glamoured"" 10 years ago. ""What happens with jazz artists is that you always have to keep bringing something new to your audience, you have to keep in touch with your audience and take them along on the journey, because the journey doesn't stop until you close your eyes,"" Wilson said. The singer takes on the Neapolitan classic ""O Sole Mio,"" but makes it clear that she won't venture into bold, operatic vocal territory. ""I stay in my lane when it comes to that sort of thing,"" she quipped. ""I don't think I can climb inside of that genre with the authenticity because it's not a part of my musical DNA."" One new area she is seemingly inclined to is social media. Wilson recently launched her own Twitter account (@reallycassandra) where she informs her thousands of followers about her latest whereabouts and publicly muses with fellow jazz musicians like Dianne Reeves. ""I absolutely love it because it breaks down the barriers between the artists and the audiences,"" Wilson said. ""It really brings you close to the people who come to sit down in the clubs. And that's a good thing. It makes us more easily accessible. It makes understanding of your art and your life more accessible to your audience."" But don't expect all access to the singer, she said. ""I am very private when it comes to my private life, but the music is for everyone. I do believe the audience have a right to the public Cassandra Wilson, so I tweet away."" She also uses Twitter as a platform to help promote other causes and artists from her hometown of Jackson, Mississippi -- such as her new discovery, a new singer/songwriter named Tawanna Shauntae', whom she describes as a ""powerhouse."" The recently opened live-music venue, The Yellow Scarf: A Music Room, in Jackson, converted from a photography studio, has become a showplace for such talent. And Wilson is the owner. ""It feels good because we're in the process of mentoring and helping other artists in Mississippi to hone their craft and get out there in the marketplace,"" she said. Wilson is currently in New York readying an eight-show stint at the famous Blue Note Jazz Club, where she has performed to sold-out audiences in for years. Just there in the spring for a weeklong engagement, now she's hosting her first album-release party with a string of concerts.","Cassandra Wilson's new album, ""Another Country,"" was released this week .

"(CNN) -- A New Mexico man held in solitary confinement in a county prison for nearly two years without ever being prosecuted has won a $22 million jury award for violation of his constitutional rights, officials said. It is one of the largest federal civil rights settlements in history involving an inmate. Stephen Slevin alleged he was essentially forgotten while in custody. ""This has never been about the money,"" Slevin said in a halting voice outside the federal courthouse in Santa Fe, just after the jury's decision. He suffers from post-traumatic stress from what he called physical and mental mistreatment by corrections officials in Dona Ana County, in the southern part of the state. ""We made a statement about what happened to me,"" he said of the verdict. Slevin, 58, was arrested in August 2005 and charged with driving while intoxicated and receiving a stolen vehicle near Las Cruces. His lawyers said the prison segregated him because he had a lifelong history of mental illness. Albuquerque civil rights attorney Matthew Coyte said his client then began to deteriorate while in isolation. ""They threw him in solitary and then ignored him,"" said Coyte. ""He disappeared into delirium, and his mental illness was made worse by being isolated from human contact and a lack of medical care."" Slevin's lawsuit alleged he became malnourished, lost significant weight, developed bedsores, fungus and dental problems and was not aware of his situation or surroundings. He was transferred to another state facility for two weeks, where he was given a psychiatric evaluation and then sent back to the Dona Ana County Detention Center, where he was again placed in solitary confinement. Coyte said Slevin did receive a brief competency hearing a year into his imprisonment, but the case against the man never proceeded. After 22 months as a pre-trial detainee, Slevin was released and the charges dismissed. He then filed suit, claiming his rights of due process were violated since he was not given a hearing before being placed in solitary confinement. Photos taken before and after his confinement show dramatic appearance changes. The plaintiff said things were so bad he was forced to pull his own tooth while in custody, and that his pleas for help were dismissed. In pre-trial motions, the county denied ""that there was lack of medical care. For most of the other allegations, officials either denied them or said they were ""without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief"" of the veracity of the claims. The defendants also said Slevin waited too late to file his suit, and that as government employees, county officials deserved immunity from liability, believing they acted in good faith as to Slevin's treatment in custody. The county had refused any public comment before the trial. There was no immediate reaction to the verdict from county officials. Slevin's legal team said the county in recent days had offered to settle the case for $2 million, just before the jury went to consider a verdict and award. Coyte told CNN he hopes Slevin's court victory will send a message throughout the state for more humane treatment of inmates, especially those with mental or physical issues. Slevin continues to have serious medical issues, and is fighting lung cancer, his lawyer said. The case is Slevin v. Board of County Commissioners of Dona Ana County (1:08-cv-01185).","Stephen Slevin alleges he was held in solitary confinement for nearly two years .

"(CNN) -- First, a Texas hospital came under fire for releasing a sick Liberian man without testing him for Ebola. He later became the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States and died from the virus. Then a nurse who treated the man at the same hospital also came down with Ebola. A top health official said a ""breach in protocol"" led to that infection. So what's the protocol for health care workers if they suspect a patient has the virus that has already killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa? Go through the checklist . Signs of an Ebola infection include fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain or bleeding, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But a key clue is whether the person traveled to an Ebola-affected area -- such as Sierra Leone, Liberia or Guinea -- in the past three weeks. That's because the symptoms of Ebola can take anywhere from two to 21 days to show up. Isolate the patient . Once Ebola is suspected, the patient should get his or own room, with a private bathroom, the CDC said. And the door to the hallway should remain closed. Hospitals should maintain a log of everyone who enters the room, the agency said. It's also a good idea to keep someone stationed at the patient's door to make sure everyone going in is wearing the right protective equipment. Get the right gear . At the very least, those who enter the patient's room should wear gloves, a gown, eye protection and a face mask. Sometimes the situation calls for more precautions, such as wearing disposable shoe covers, leg covers and two layers of gloves. Those extra steps are needed if there is vomit, human waste or ""copious amounts of blood"" in the room, the CDC said. Know the right order . It's not enough to have protective clothing; putting it on in the right order is just as important. ""The dressing and undressing of (protective wear) should be supervised by another trained member of the team,"" the World Health Organization advises. After donning scrubs, health care workers should put on either boots or closed, water-resistant shoes with overshoes. Then a waterproof gown should go over the scrubs. If one isn't available, wear a waterproof apron over a gown. Next come the face mask, goggles and a head cover, if available. Finally, after washing their hands, health care workers should put on gloves over the sleeves' cuffs. When it's time to take the gear off, extreme care must be taken to avoid contaminating regular clothing, eyes or mucous membranes. CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said gear removal is a ""major potential area for risk."" ""When you have gone into and potentially soiled or contaminated gloves or masks or other things, to remove those without any risk of any contaminated material touching you and being then on your clothes or face or skin and leading to an infection is critically important and not easy to do right,"" Frieden said. Keep visitors out . It may seem obvious, but it's important to keep visitors away from the patient's room. ""Exceptions may be considered on a case-by-case basis for those who are essential for the patient's well-being,"" the CDC said. Keeping visitors away doesn't just protect them; it also protects hospital workers, patients and others in case the visitor may have contracted Ebola, too. Those who do visit should be screened for fever and other symptoms. All these procedures may seem tedious, but every precaution matters, Frieden said. ""The care of Ebola can be done safely, but it's hard to do it safely. It requires meticulous and scrupulous attention to infection control, and even a single, innocent, inadvertent slip can result in contamination.""","Hospitals should ask whether a patient traveled to an Ebola-affected area .
Patients suspected of having Ebola should have their own rooms and private bathrooms .

"Marietta, Georgia (CNN) -- Whether the prosecution will seek the death penalty in Justin Ross Harris hot-car death case will be decided in two to three weeks, Cobb County District Attorney Vic Reynolds said Thursday. Reynolds' statement came hours after the Georgia father was indicted by a grand jury on eight counts, including malice murder and two counts of felony murder. ""We're pleased with the pace and thoroughness of this investigation, which continues on today,"" Reynolds said. ""The evidence in this case has led us to this point today. Whether it leads us to anyone else remains to be answered."" The next step will be to put Harris' case on Superior Court Judge Mary Staley's arraignment calendar, which should happen within three weeks, the prosecutor said. Motions will then be filed before the case goes to a trial calendar. Reynolds declined to take questions or comment further, saying, ""This case will be tried in a court of law,"" and not in the media. If Reynolds seeks the death penalty, it will be for the malice murder charge, which alleges that Harris, who has claimed his son's death was an accident, premeditated the child's killing. Harris' attorney, H. Maddox Kilgore, called the charges excessive, describing them as a part of the ""state's maze of theories."" ""It was always an accident. When the time comes, and we've worked through the state's maze of theories at trial, it's still going to be a terrible, gut-wrenching accident. And all the eccentricities and moral failings of Ross' life isn't going to change that,"" he told reporters. The other five charges Harris faces are: first-degree cruelty to children, second-degree cruelty to children, criminal attempt to commit a felony (sexual exploitation of a minor) and two counts of dissemination of harmful material to minors. According to the indictment, the grand jury found that on June 18, Harris ""did unlawfully, and with malice aforethought, cause the death of Cooper Harris ... by placing said Cooper Harris into a child car seat and leaving him alone in a hot motor vehicle."" The two felony murder charges allege that Harris killed his 22-month-old son while committing the felonies of first- and second-degree cruelty to children. One count states he killed Cooper ""maliciously,"" while the other felony murder count says Harris killed him ""with criminal negligence."" Harris faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison if convicted on any of the murder charges. By leaving Cooper in the car, Harris caused the boy ""cruel and excessive physical pain,"" the cruelty to children charges allege. The criminal attempt to commit a felony and dissemination of harmful materials charges are not related directly to Cooper's death. They involve allegations that Harris requested a nude photo of a minor's genitalia and sent the same minor descriptions of ""sexual excitement and sexual conduct,"" according to the indictment. A Cobb County detective testified at an earlier probable cause hearing that while Cooper was in the car at his father's workplace, Harris was sexting with numerous women and sent one of them, who was underage, a photo of his erect penis. Harris pleaded not guilty to murder and child cruelty charges in June. Cobb County Chief Magistrate Frank Cox signed off on the charges, stating Harris would've had to notice that ""the stench in the car was overwhelming"" when he got in it as he left work and ""drove it for some instance"" before stopping to check on the boy. Charges filed in an indictment supersede the previous charges. Harris has been held without bond since Cooper's death this summer. Authorities have painted Harris as a terrible father who, after admittedly looking up online how hot a car needed to be to kill a child, purposely strapped his son into his sweltering SUV to die. His motivation? The prosecutor has characterized Harris as an unfaithful husband who wanted a childless life. Kilgore has argued his client tragically forgot his child in the car. Friends described Harris as a doting dad, not a malicious one, who loved to show off his blond, bright-eyed boy and talked about him incessantly. It all started simply enough: Harris left home with Cooper in a rear-facing car seat in the back of his 2011 Hyundai Tucson, then headed to his job as a Web developer for Atlanta-based Home Depot after making a quick stop at a fast-food restaurant for breakfast. But he didn't follow through on his routine of stopping to drop the boy off at daycare. Instead, according to a criminal warrant, Harris drove to work and left Cooper strapped in his car seat. He went back to his SUV during lunch, put something in the car, then returned to work. All the while, the vehicle got increasingly hotter, with records showing the temperature topped 92 that day -- which can make the heat inside a closed vehicle soar past 100 degrees quickly. Sometime around 4:15 p.m., seven hours after he'd arrived at work, Harris got back into his Hyundai and left work. Witnesses told police that, soon thereafter, they heard ""squealing tires (as) the vehicle came to a stop"" in a shopping center. Cobb County Police Detective Phil Stoddard testified at the probable cause hearing that Harris got out of the car yelling, ""Oh my God, what have I done?"" He then stood with a blank look, going to the other side of his SUV to make a phone call after someone told him that his son needed CPR, a witness told police, according to Stoddard. Witness Leonard Madden testified that, upon leaving a restaurant, he noticed Harris was distraught and crying. ""He was hollering,"" Madden testified, recounting the father saying, ""Oh, my God! Oh, my God! My son is dead!"" Harris had to be physically restrained once it became clear Cooper wouldn't make it -- at which time it was 88 degrees -- according to police. Leaving his son alone in the car wasn't the only thing Harris did that day, authorities say. While at work, he messaged six women besides his wife and exchanged explicit texts with some of them -- including the lewd photo that he sent to an underage female, Stoddard testified. Yet even after these allegations surfaced, his wife Leanna Harris stood by her man. She sat calmly through the probable cause hearing, and at Cooper's funeral flatly insisted she was ""absolutely not"" angry with her husband. ""Ross is and was and will be, if we have more children, a wonderful father,"" Leanna Harris said at the funeral in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, a gathering that her husband also addressed via phone from the Cobb County Jail. ""Ross is a wonderful daddy and leader for our household. Cooper meant the world to him."" Given the district attorney's comments Thursday about whether anybody else will be charged in connection with the case, the attorney for Leanna Harris said he was surprised Reynolds was still contemplating charges. ""I am surprised that the district attorney is still contemplating after almost three months of reviewing the evidence whether or not to charge my client, if that is who he was referring to in his press conference,"" attorney Lawrence Zimmerman said. ""By now, I would think they would have been able to make a final decision and clear her from any wrongdoing."" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin and Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta, with Devon M. Sayers and Stephanie Gallman reporting from Marietta. CNN's MaryLynn Ryan and Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- Court officials have released the chilling audiotapes that prosecutors say depict convicted child rapist Warren Jeffs training the girls he claimed were his ""spiritual wives"" to have sex with him. The audiotapes, that were key pieces of evidence in Jeffs' trial, brought some jurors to tears during Jeffs' trial. Last week, a Texas jury sentenced Jeffs to life in prison for aggravated sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl and 20 years in prison for the sexual assault of a 15-year-old girl. Jeffs, 55, had perverted his position as the head of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to ""satisfy his own personal appetites and desires,"" prosecutor Eric Nichols said. Jeffs talks about those desires on audiotapes that authorities seized from his car and the church's Yearning For Zion Ranch compound in Eldorado, Texas. The tapes, that were obtained by many media outlets including the Salt Lake Tribune and CNN affiliate KSTU on Thursday, contain what prosecutors say is evidence of Jeffs instructing underage girls to have sex with him. At one point, Jeffs is heard saying God instructs ""for quorums of wives to be with me, to assist me. To be a comfort. Yes, even physically."" Several times, Jeffs refers to having sexual relations with him as ""heavenly sessions,"" and he instructed the young ladies that they also ""must assist each other"" during these sessions. ""You have to know how to be excited sexually,"" Jeffs said. ""The Lord has intended that my ladies, all of my ladies be trained."" During Jeffs' trial, an FBI agent read from a journal that Jeffs kept in which prosecutors say prove he knew his behavior would be frowned upon. Jeffs allegedly wrote: ""Things are happening so quickly. There is an even younger girl that the Lord wants me to take. She is 13. For some reason, the Lord is sending me these girls that can be worked with."" Jeffs also wrote: ""If the world knew what I was doing, they would hang me from the highest tree,"" according to evidence presented in court.","The tapes were key pieces of evidence in the sexual assault trial of Warren Jeffs .

"(CNN) -- Whoever is running the social media strategy for the New York Police Department needs to be fired because that person has no idea how to follow the rules of social media. On Tuesday, the NYPD's Twitter account, @NYPDNews, asked New Yorkers to ""tag themselves"" in photos with New York Police officers using the hashtag #myNYPD. Before midnight, more than 70,000 tweets containing photos or stories of police brutality flooded the Twittersphere, replacing #HappyEarthDay as the trending topic by late Tuesday evening. It was a disaster. Instead of igniting a positive viral PR campaign, a single tweet managed to set the NYPD's reputation on fire. They should have seen this one coming. Twitter is a great tool to read breaking news, research prospective clients, connect with friends, discuss live events or gain access to your favorite celebrity. But it's a terrible place to try to control a conversation because you simply can't. Social media disasters are becoming a regular occurrence. Remember the PR executive from media company IAC who sent out a racially offensive tweet and raised a firestorm? Or when Burger King's account got hacked and fake tweets referencing race and drugs were posted? It's like rubbernecking an accident on the highway -- we can't help but stare and comment before we move on with our lives. And while #myNYPD will be largely forgotten by you and me, the NYPD will feel the pain for months to come. Rule 1: Every social media platform has a very specific demographic . Facebook users are a different demographic than Twitter users, just as Pinterest users are different from Instagram users. Twitter users are the youngest demographic of all major social media outlets. If you tweet, you're speaking to 18- to 29-year-olds, not middle-aged moms on Pinterest and Facebook. And those millennials are unforgiving -- they care more about ""social expression"" than ""social obedience,"" which means they'll tweet what they feel with no filter. Rule 2: You will never control the conversation on Twitter . Tweets are like roaches; once you spot a contrarian or sarcastic reply, you know there are hundreds more right behind it, and there's no way to exterminate them. If you need to control the conversation, use Facebook. On Facebook, you can delete individual comments that do not contribute to your overall social goal. On Twitter, the users are in control. Rule 3: Social media is often ruled by the haters . Social media is a love-hate world, and among your followers you'll have just as many fans as foes. Even Starbucks, one of the most dominant brands in the United States, is probably publicly hated more than it's praised. The NYPD has a well-organized social media savvy hater: Occupy Wall Street NYC. And they jumped all over #myNYPD using the Occupy Wall Street NYC Twitter account. In fact, they are credited with making the photos of the police brutality start to trend nationally. Rule 4: If you ask people on social media what they think ... they'll tell you . People on social media are ruthlessly honest, way more so than they would be in person. Ask their opinion about your brand and you'll get an instantaneous barometer (the good, the bad and the atrocious). Forget the user-generated PR campaign. It's better to monitor your reputation on Twitter using reputation management software and reply directly to people who tweet bad things about you. Rule 5: The odds are not in your favor to get good news . Despite the overwhelming success of viral positive news websites like Upworthy or Inspire52 (disclaimer: I'm the founder), most content that gets shared online is negative, funny or sarcastic. And, unless you request that people tell you their positive experiences, research shows that humans are more likely to remember negative experiences. But obviously, there are exceptions, like NYPD's Twitter fiasco. What's the moral of this story? If you want to use social media to promote a brand, either use the rules to pick the right platform and own the conversation or social media will own you. NYPD should have solicited feel-good user generated photos through a contest on Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest and then published them on Facebook where they could delete the negative and sarcastic responses. Now that you know the rules, answer this question: What do you think will happen if you invite the youngest and most urban demographic on Twitter (and Occupy Wall Street NYC who happens to follow you) to post photos of cops in New York City? Unfortunately, common sense, safe driving and social media rules are a lot like deodorant, the people who need it the most don't use it.","An NYPD social media campaign on Twitter backfired .

"(CNN) -- In Paraguay's capital city of Asuncion, residents amble down the streets with jugs and insulated cups of all shapes and sizes, sipping yerba mate tea through straws. (Or perhaps it's terere, yerba mate's cold counterpart, served heavy over ice.) Locals and visitors alike might stroll past a food stall hawking bori bori, a thick soup of corn flour dumplings and chicken. There's also bife koygua to sample, beef smothered with fried onions and topped with a fried egg. The more pescatarian-minded might try a bounty of fish like surubi, a type of bottom-dwelling catfish, and dorado, all straight from the Paraguay River. 14 things to know about Paraguay . But almost everyone will want to encounter one of the country's most intriguing dishes, which came about as a serendipitous failure. Sopa paraguaya, which means Paraguayan soup, is a misnomer. It is not even close to being a soup; in fact, it's more akin to a cheesy cornbread. As with any national dish, there is a certain amount of lore that stews around its origin. Legend has it that Carlos Antonio Lopez, the corpulent and corrupt president-cum-dictator of Paraguay from 1841 to 1862, decided one day to feast upon a nice warming bowl of corn soup. The cook accidentally put too much corn flour in the soup, and what came out was a solid rather than a liquid. Fearing Lopez's notorious iron fist, the cook decided to slice and serve the cake-like soup with a bit of nationalistic advertising as sopa paraguaya. To the cook's luck, Lopez liked the marketing and, even more so, the newfangled sopa. Nowadays, its a dish -- the country's national dish, at that -- most often served at special occasions like Holy Week and weddings, but it's too good a dish not to make at home from time to time. Sopa Paraguaya . (Serves 8) Excerpted from ""Mallmann On Fire"" by Francis Mallmann (Artisan Books). Copyright © 2014.

Heat an oven to 375°F, with a rack in the lower third. Brush a 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan well with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and coat with ¼ cup of the cornmeal. 2. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over low heat. Add the onions and saute until tender and translucent; do not let them brown. Set aside to cool to room temperature. 3. In a medium bowl, mix together the milk, beaten eggs, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes and cooled onions. Sprinkle one-third of the remaining cornmeal evenly over the bottom of the pan. Scatter one-third of the mozzarella evenly over it. Ladle one-third of the milk, egg and onion mixture over the cheese. Repeat two more times. The mixture will look quite wet. 4. Set the pan on a baking sheet and bake for about 1 hour, until puffed and golden brown and quite fluffy; do not let it get too firm, or it will be dry. Cool in the pan on a rack. 5. Run a metal spatula around the sides of the pan to loosen the sopa, place a platter or tray over the top and invert to unmold.

"Raleigh, North Carolina (CNN) -- Olegario Rodriguez arrived at the DMV long before the doors opened Monday. He wanted to claim the first spot in line. As he waited in near-freezing temperatures, he skimmed a driver's ed manual, trying to soak in last-minute details. ""I need my license,"" said Rodriguez, 25. ""When you drive without a license, you get into a lot of trouble, and I don't want any trouble."" Rodriguez has been granted deferred action under the Obama administration's program for young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. But until this week, getting a driver's license was out of reach. On Monday, North Carolina -- the state where he now lives after coming to the United States from Mexico 15 years ago --- debuted new driver's licenses designed for those that have qualified under the federal program. Officials originally had proposed putting a thick pink stripe on the licenses to make it clear that the holders were undocumented immigrants and not U.S. citizens. But transportation officials changed course away from that idea, which some immigrant rights advocates said amounted to a discriminatory ""scarlet letter."" The new licenses that debuted Monday denote the deferred-action immigrants as ""limited term"" and ""legal presence/no lawful status"" in smaller, red letters. ""This final design will allow for ease of implementation by keeping the coding used in the production process consistent with other licenses,"" a state government spokesman said. The state's transportation secretary said officials had one goal in mind. ""This program is about accountability and safety, making our roads safer for all North Carolinians,"" Transportation Secretary Tony Tata said in a written statement. Different states, different rules . For months, driver's licenses and other state benefits have been at the heart of a battle in the nationwide immigration debate. Supporters of licenses for undocumented immigrants argue that it's safer to have more drivers trained and insured, and opponents argue that such systems are rife with fraud. In January, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez said she would push to repeal the state law allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses. That same month, the governor of Illinois signed a new law that would allow undocumented immigrants to get temporary licenses. In at least 38 states, officials have said recipients of deferred action are eligible for driver's licenses, according to the National Immigration Law Center. But in some states, like Arizona and Nebraska, officials have stepped up efforts to stop licenses from being issued, the law center said. In North Carolina, even though the new licenses weren't the ""scarlet letter"" many immigrant advocates feared, some still criticized the state's approach. ""This new look is a huge step in the right direction,"" Raul Pinto, staff attorney for the ACLU of North Carolina, said in a statement. But Pinto said the organization had lingering concerns. ""We still question the necessity of including distinguishing language such as 'no lawful status' on the licenses and will be watching closely to see how these changes are implemented,"" he said. Immigrants debate design . Rodriguez said he was grateful to get a license, but wished it had a different design that didn't mention his immigration status. ""I can't deny that there is a lot of discrimination in this country,"" he said. ""I would rather it (the license) didn't have those words but there is nothing I can do."" Montserrat Manta, an undocumented immigrant, said she didn't plan to get one of the new licenses, even though she would be eligible. ""I've been discriminated (against) too many times and I don't want to give them that pleasure again,"" she said. Others said they didn't mind. ""I have always driven illegally, so it does not bother me that they put this on it,"" said Cinthia Marroqin, who also waited in line at a Raleigh DMV Monday. ""Because I know who I am, and am not afraid."" Carlos Zuniga, who was also one of the first people in line at the Raleigh office Monday, said he hoped getting a driver's license would open doors for him. ""A license is very important to get better work, and to be treated better,"" he said. Some said they were hoping to push for all undocumented immigrants to have the chance to drive. Maria Rios said she came to the DMV Monday because she was the only one in her house who could get a license. ""But my parents and others also need one,"" she said, ""to go to work and make a living."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","North Carolina debuts new driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants .

"(CNN) -- TV personality Kelly Ripa recently told In Touch Weekly she uses Botox possibly as often as she trims her nails. She also said her kids are useful gauges for when it's time for a tune-up. She told the magazine: ""When my kids start asking me if I'm mad at them, and I say, 'Why do you think I'm mad at you?' They say it's because I'm frowning. I go, 'Oh no! I am? I'll be right back!'"" Pointing the needle in the other direction, recall actress Julia Roberts' anti-Botox comments a couple of years ago: ""I want my kids to know when I'm pissed, when I'm happy and when I'm confounded,"" she told Elle Magazine. ""Your face tells a story ... and it shouldn't be a story about your drive to the doctor's office."" Here we have two glamorous celebrity moms in their 40s with opposite feelings about America's most popular cosmetic surgery procedure, yet both seem to agree that altering the face alters the way we relate to our children. Have we really talked about this, though? I mean, really talked about it. Just how does dulling facial expressions, appearing to freeze them in some cases -- yes we can tell, Fembots -- affect that vital two-way communication street between mother and child? Could not being able to furrow your brow in disapproval when little Johnny throws a fistful of mashed potatoes at your chest make you a less effective mom? ""(Botox) likely does limit and distort parent-infant communication, possibly making the parent look 'flat' emotionally,"" says Dr. Ed Tronick, associate professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts. ""Facial expressions for parents and young children are really critical ways in which we communicate our intentions or whether we're angry or sad, and that involves this very complex array of all the muscles that go into making facial expressions. So if you limit that range of expression, especially with very young children who are really attuned to reading facial expressions, then you limit the amount of information, the amount of emotion that you communicate using a facial expression."" Celebs and civilians alike expected to 'bounce back' after baby . I was introduced to the notion that babies and infants scan mom's face -- more so than the teenager whose head is buried in a smartphone -- while pregnant with my daughter. A friend had given me a copy of ""The Female Brain"" by Louann Brizendine and I was fascinated to read that female babies are especially sensitive to their mother's moods and facial cues. In the months after giving birth, I really went for it in the grinning department, quite possibly setting my daughter up for a successful career as a clown. Of course, let's not forget that tots receive information from mom in other ways, like caressing, singing, voice tone and deep sighs when presented with a particularly mortifying loaded diaper. Tronick, who also serves as director of the University of Massachusetts-Boston hospital's child development unit, says these other channels would make it difficult to separate out and measure a possible Botox effect. Still, a Botox study came out last year that found the toxin lowers a key emotion: empathy. Published in the journal of Social Psychology and Personality Science, the paper was based in part on an experiment in which adults who had Botox were compared with adults with the dermal filler Restylane, which unlike Botox doesn't affect muscle function. At the root of the experiment, says psychologist and co-author of the study David Neal, is the notion that we read a person's emotions partly by mimicking their facial expressions. Inject some good 'ol Clostridium botulinum, and Neal says you likely ""subtly impair your ability to mimic other people's facial expressions."" Moms gone wild: '40-year-old reversion' ""Mimicry actually serves important social functions,"" he says. ""When we mimic someone, they trust us more, like us more, and are more likely to be helpful. Mother-child interaction follows these same rules because children learn to mimic and respond positively to mimicry from a very early age -- and it may be innate."" Right -- most new parents squeal with delight the first time their baby copies them by poking their tongue out or blowing a little raspberry. ""So, while no experiments have directly tested this yet,"" says Neal, ""it is plausible that Botoxed mothers are subtly undermining their ability to connect emotionally with their children."" Perhaps we can also learn something from so-called ""still-face"" or ""blank face"" experiments. In those, researchers study an infant's reaction while their mothers face them and display no facial expressions whatsoever for a controlled length of time. While unsettling to watch, the studies are said to help teach us how infants' social and emotional development might be linked to the emotional state of their caregivers. It also offers clues as to the effects of a mother's post-partum depression on her child. Tronick started conducting ""still-face"" experiments more than 30 years ago, and says he finds infants as young as 3-4 months typically respond to their despondent mothers by gesturing to her and trying to illicit a response from her. ""And if it lasts a minute or two, sometimes the babies end up getting upset or crying because of the lack of response on the part of the mother,"" he says. Finding a mom friend in the big city . But when it comes to Botox, Chicago-based plastic surgeon Steven Dayan isn't convinced the procedure could lead to a mother-child disconnection. ""I categorically, overwhelmingly disagree that that's even a possibility,"" he says. ""You'd have to put so much Botox in to reduce that much animation that the person would look like a stroke victim. Even when I've put Botox into the upper third of the face where it's most commonly used, you still have complete animation in the lower two-thirds of your face."" Dayan, who says quite a few of his patients are new moms anxious for Botox as soon as they stop breastfeeding, maintains that if you emerge from the doctor's office without being able to move a single muscle on your face, you've likely been treated by an irresponsible physician or one who has received poor training. ""Botox should be done in a slight moderate dose so people can still animate,"" he says. ""You just reduce the appearance of the anger. We're just blunting the expression ... really nobody should know that it was done."" Furthermore, Dayan says, what's so bad about a kid not seeing his mother's face scrunched in anger? ""If these moms can't make the angry face, or they can't project this angry image, maybe they are presenting a more positive image to their kids,"" he says. ""Maybe they're happier, maybe they're going to be better parents."" Possibly, but trying to project a positive image when your child is lowering the pet hamster into the garbage disposal isn't necessarily productive. Stay-at-home mom Abbie Gale said her three sons -- twins age 12 and an 8-year-old -- didn't notice anything different after she had Botox, aside from the bag of peas plastered to her forehead (to prevent bruising, she says). She was, however, surprised to discover her marriage benefited from the procedure. ""What I found was this strange warm and fuzzy reaction my husband was having to me looking more relaxed,"" said Gale, 39. ""It wasn't my intention but ... Botox makes me look like I have things under control, far more than I probably do. ""I was trying to look my best so that my husband would always find me attractive. I didn't realize that those brow lines were more than just wrinkles. If one of Botox's side effects is making me look rested and more approachable, then sign me up forever."" You go, girl! But when it comes to infants, Tronick doesn't think a brighter face because of Botox leads to giving off a more positive impression. ""It's just a momentary phenomenon,"" he says. ""Very quickly you're saying, 'What is this person really feeling? What does this expression mean to me?' And I think to the infant, they're not getting any information from the facial expression and they're wondering, in a sense, 'Is this a positive facial expression or a negative one?' There's nothing to read because it's not changing."" Sort of like how repeating a word over and over renders it ineffective. Like yesterday when I said ""no"" 827 times as I watched my daughter slowly carry my favorite sandal toward the trash can. Where did the shoe end up? In the trash can. I haven't tried Botox and can't say whether I ever will because I don't own a crystal ball. But I'd like to think my 2-year-old has had all channels of maternal communication fully available to her since her birth. Sure, it makes sense that some moms turn to the needle for some assistance and perhaps when kids are older it's not a big deal. But when they're teeny and vulnerable and might be hanging on our every head tilt and smile and squint, would it be wise to hold off on cosmetically enhancing our facial features? The answer, perhaps, is on the little face looking back at us from the high chair. Do you think facial Botox treatment could affect mother-child communication?

"(CNN) -- The Raspberry Pi is all the rage for hobbyists in search of cheap, credit card-sized computers that can run a full PC operating system. Arduino boards have been around nearly a decade, meanwhile, powering robots and all sorts of other creative electronics projects. Now, a project called UDOO (""you do"") seeks to bring the best elements of Raspberry Pi and Arduino together into a single mini-PC that can run either Android or Linux. ""With UDOO, we want to combine the winning characteristics of Arduino and Raspberry Pi in one single board.

UDOO-based projects demonstrated in the video included a camera-equipped toy car controlled remotely with a tablet, programming education for kids, and a video game involving players running on equipment reminiscent of the Wii Balance Board. Touchscreens and various other types of sensors can be connected to the UDOO. ""Want to build an LED light-controller, an RFID reader, or a creative game controller?

UDOO's designers claim the board will have ""the power of four Raspberry Pis,"" apparently in reference to the quad-core chip (the Raspberry Pi uses a single-core). The UDOO also has twice as much RAM (1GB) and Gigabit Ethernet as opposed to the Pi's 100 Megabit Ethernet. The Raspberry Pi has the UDOO beat on price, though, with models selling for $25 or $35.

"(CNN) -- When the guests around your Thanksgiving table are busy stuffing their bellies today, here's one way to break the lull in conversation: dazzle them with some tasty turkey trivia. Here's 10 to get you started. We bet you they'll eat them up! 1. A tradition is born: TV dinners have Thanksgiving to thank. In 1953, someone at Swanson misjudged the number of frozen turkeys it would sell that Thanksgiving -- by 26 TONS! Some industrious soul came up with a brilliant plan: Why not slice up the meat and repackage with some trimmings on the side?Thus, the first TV dinner was born! 2. Going shopping?: Not if you're a plumber. Black Friday is the busiest day of the year for them, according to Roto-Rooter, the nation's largest plumbing service. After all, someone has to clean up after household guests who ""overwhelm the system."" 3. This land is my land: There are four places in the U.S. named Turkey. Louisiana's Turkey Creek is the most populous, with a whopping 440 residents. There's also Turkey, Texas; Turkey, North Carolina; and Turkey Creek, Arizona. Oh, let's not forget the two townships in Pennsylvania: the creatively named Upper Turkeyfoot and Lower Turkeyfoot! 4. Leaving a legacy: When Abe Lincoln declared Thanksgiving a national holiday, it was thanks to the tireless efforts of a magazine editor named Sarah Josepha Hale. Her other claim to fame? She also wrote the nursery rhyme, ""Mary had a Little Lamb."" 5. Gobble, gobble?: Not so fast. Only male turkeys, called toms, gobble. Females, called hens, cackle. 6. Have it your way: If Ben Franklin did, the turkey would be our national bird. An eagle, he wrote in a letter to his daughter, had ""bad moral character."" A turkey, on the other hand, was a ""much more respectable bird."" 7. Born in the U.S.A.: Thanksgiving is not just an American holiday. Canadians celebrate it too. Except they do it the second Monday in October. 8. Break out the menurkeys: The first day of Hanukkah and Thanksgiving come together today for the first time since 1888. Scientists say the confluence won't occur again for another 70,000 years, give or take a millennium. 9. Doomed from birth: Those poor turkeys; they don't stand a chance. Just look at the name we gave them. A turkey less than 12-weeks-old is called a fryer-roaster. 10. Talking turkey: Why is it called a turkey? Oh boy, this will take some explainin'. Back in the day, the Europeans took a liking to the guinea fowls imported to the continent. Since the birds were imported by Turkish merchants, the English called them turkeys. Later, when the Spaniards came to America, they found a bird that tasted like those guinea fowls. When they were sent to Europe, the English called these birds ""turkeys"" as well.

"(CNN) -- As a little girl, she never got a valentine at school parties. As a teenager, she never had a best friend, a boyfriend or a date. As a woman, she's never had a relationship. She's never been kissed. Her dream to one day become a wife and mother is fading as she grapples with the reality that it may never happen. Penny Loker, 31, was born with hemifacial microsomia and Goldenhar Syndrome, two birth defects that left her with a disfigured face. Hemifacial microsomia causes a malformation of the ear and/or the structure of the lower jaw. Goldenhar Syndrome is a congenital condition that produces abnormalities of the head and the bones of the spinal column. It usually affects the appearance of eyes, ears, facial bones and the mouth. Both conditions are complex, as are their names. But for a little girl facing a big world, the names were simple: Monster. Ugly. Freak. Loker was raised in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, in a home where love and acceptance were given freely. Her father died soon after Loker's first birthday. Her mother, a strong, loving woman, readily took on the challenge of raising Loker and her sisters. That included arranging for multiple surgeries at hospitals far from home. Loker's recoveries were lengthy and painful, recalls older sister Crystal Loker. ""But even then Penny had a positive attitude. She was a trouper who kept her smile and didn't complain."" 'Impaired Perceptions': Photographer rejects first impressions . At home, Loker's looks were not an issue and she was treated the same as her sisters. She knew she looked a bit different, and she knew it caused her to be in the hospital a lot, but she had a child's innocence and accepted it as normal. When it was time to start school, she discovered how different she actually was. She spent a lonely childhood excluded from nearly everything. She had no friends. She accepted the name-calling as part of her life and seemed to understand that crying or fighting back only made it worse. So she quietly endured it. She remembers that pain and humiliation well. ""As an adult, it's hard to stand by silently when you know what these kids are going through,"" Loker says. ""But it's equally difficult to speak out when you don't feel empowered to do so."" As she got older, the name-calling was more often behind her back than to her face. By the time she reached high school, she had learned there would be no friends, parties or dates for a girl who looked like a freak. ""It hurt, but there was nothing I could do to change it,"" she says. While day-to-day encounters with strangers brought the same hurtful stares and comments, Loker was used to it. Then came a day with such cruelty it remains a vivid memory. ""For graduation my sister gave me a gift certificate for a manicure and pedicure. I'd never had one before, and it was a wonderful experience. I left the spa feeling truly pretty for the first time in my adult life."" But less than a block from the salon, she encountered a carload of boys who slowed to look at her and began pointing and calling her names. Distraught, she walked as quickly as she could to get away from them, thinking all the while that she was not beautiful after all. ""The pretty nails made no difference at all. Shamed and humiliated, I realized I was still the same girl that everyone made fun of,"" she recalls. ""I remember that day as one of the worst."" Talking to someone with a chronic illness . But time can ease all wounds, and her determined spirit taught her to find the good around her. She has a core group of girlfriends and relatives who cherish her as she is. She speaks proudly of being able to provide for herself, thanks to her job at Rogers Communications, where she spends her days handling customer requests. The company was recognized this year as a diversity leader corporation, a recognition that only adds to Loker's pride. There are many adventures in life that she is hesitant to embrace, even though she is physically able. She prefers not to shop alone. She has never been on a true vacation, saying the thought of one is scary. Yet it's a feat she is determined to accomplish. She is saving now for a trip to California to visit either BlizzCon or Comic-con. ""I'm kind of a geek and play the online MMO World of Warcraft with my sister and her husband, and we always talk about how cool it would be to go there,"" she says. ""People dress up so I would feel 'normal', not out of place."" She's quick to point out she has no interest in visiting a theme park geared toward children, where she'd likely be subjected to stares as parents attempt to answer questions about her. She wishes she could open the dialogue about individuals with malformations by educating people, especially children, whose natural curiosity can eventually become cruelty if left unaddressed. ""Educating them early on would help them learn to be more tolerant of others who are different. The ability to love, share, bring happiness and help others is the real beauty of a person,"" she says. ""The exterior doesn't necessarily reflect the beauty that often lives inside. And when people fail to remember that, they can miss out on the love and friendship of a truly special person."" Crystal Loker agrees. ""Penny is truly beautiful. She's always seeing the best in others and never has an unkind word for anyone. In Penny's world, others always come first. She's full of laughter and smiles. When you spend a day with her, you go home feeling good about yourself."" Loker welcomes the opportunity to teach all of us to see beyond the surface. But until then, she continues to hope for good days in her own life, which for her means days when she is ignored. ""When I go out to dinner with my friends and no one stares at me or asks to be moved to a table further away from me, that's a good day,"" she says. In spite of it all, Loker is quick to point out her many blessings: Being able to share a home with her family, having a job she loves, having good friends and a good health care system to help with the cost of a lifetime of surgeries. Her only regret? ""I have so much love to give and I would love to share that with a family of my own. I understand it will probably never happen, and I'm learning to accept it. But I am sad about it,"" she says. ""It feels like the one great loss in my life."" Penny Loker will be on the CNN Facebook page for a live discussion Thursday night at 8 p.m. ET.","Birth defects left Penny Loker with a disfigured face .

"(CNN) -- Let's face it: Most of us don't e-mail, tweet, text or post anything worthy of clandestine scrutiny. But having concerns about NSA cybersnooping doesn't mean we must surrender all privacy -- what's left of it -- in our day-to-day online activities. It's easy to forget that we're volunteering basic information about ourselves in return for free e-mail, social networking and other digital services. And let's remember that third parties -- from government agencies to cybercriminals -- can get their hands on even more personal stuff if they're actively trying. So, whether it's due to a vague fear of Big Brother or a more specific desire to keep your bank information out of the hands of thieves, you might be considering ways to keep your communication more secure. ""So much that's geo-political, so much cybercrime, so many struggles of various types are being played out in terms of information security today,"" said Wade Williamson, a senior security analyst at Palo Alto Networks. ""It's not just that people decided to get interested in encryption all of a sudden."" CNNMoney: How to hide from the NSA . Specifically, encryption has come up a lot in recent days. For one, NSA whistleblower (some would say ""traitor"") Edward Snowden said Monday in an online question-and-answer session that e-mail encryption is an effective way of foiling government surveillance. ""Encryption works,"" he wrote. ""Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on. Unfortunately, endpoint security is so terrifically weak that NSA can frequently find ways around it."" Encryption is a method of securing your files, including e-mail, by encoding it so that the intended recipient can read it, but anyone who may intercept the message along the way cannot. An encryption tool turns your original message (called ""plaintext"") into a garbled mess (or ""ciphertext"") while it's flying from Point A to Point B. The system gives the approved recipient a decryption tool which makes the text readable once it arrives at its destination. With all of the renewed interest in online privacy, we talked with Williamson about ways to help keep your data secure -- before, during and after sending it. Before . First things first. There are ways to make your contact with every website you visit more secure. A ""secure sockets layer"" (SSL) provides a layer of security during everything from Web browsing to text messaging. Many major websites offer the option of using a secure connection all the time. Williamson and other security experts suggest doing this when given the option. If not -- sometimes it can be as easy as tweaking ""http"" to ""https"" in your browser's address bar. ""By and large, you can just throw an 'S' into the URL and go to town,"" Williamson said. There are also tools like HTTPS Everywhere, a free extension for Chrome and Firefox browsers, that encrypt your connection with most major websites. Obama: I'm no Dick Cheney . During . Most major e-mail services, like Outlook and Gmail, offer some form of encryption. Check your e-mail's security settings for options. But for people who are really worried about their e-mails being intercepted -- and that's always just an unsecured network and an eager hacker away -- Williamson suggests buying encryption software. (Note: His company focuses on network security and does not sell encryption software to individuals). With many of the systems, customers will get digital ""certificates"" for themselves called private keys. Everyone with whom they want to share encrypted messages will receive public keys. Using such a system, only someone with a private certificate could descramble a message's content. After . So, your data may be secure while it's hurtling through cyberspace. But what if somebody breaks into your car, where you stupidly left your laptop, and makes off with it? That's where disk encryption comes in. There's some free disk encryption software floating around in the open-source community, but for most folks this, too, will cost some cash. In effect, disk encryption scrambles everything stored to your computer, requiring a password or other approved recovery tool to decode it. So, if your computer falls into the wrong hands, all won't be lost. To summarize, there are lots of encryption and other security options out there. Some are quick, easy and free. Others are going to cost money for specialized software, hardware or both. To find a level of security you're comfortable with, start by poking around with security settings on your browser, e-mail client and favorite websites. Then consider whether you want professional help to get to the next level. Do you have other favorite security tricks?

"(CNN) -- Looks like Dave Chappelle is making up for lost time. The comedian, who famously and abruptly quit his acclaimed, wildly popular ""Chappelle's Show"" on Comedy Central in 2005 and dropped out of public life, seems to be a bit less reclusive these days. He recently appeared on the ""Late Show With David Letterman,"" telling the host he never actually quit but was instead ""seven years late for work."" He also ""crashed"" morning show ""Today"" by banging on the glass window and holding a sign advertising his comedy shows at Radio City Music Hall. On Wednesday night, Chappelle played Radio City for a two-hour concert that the New York Daily News said showed he had ""returned with his irreverent and often raunchy sense of humor fully intact."" ""I'm just here to make enlightened money so I can disappear again,"" the paper quoted Chappelle as saying during his stand-up. The New York Times noted that Chappelle's act reflected his almost a decade of absence from the set. ""Once you chat with Matt Lauer while holding a handmade sign plugging your new shows, your days as a reclusive rebel are over,"" Jason Zinoman of The New York Times wrote. ""That shift is reflected in his comedy."" Chappelle has had a few pop-up and one-off performances over the years, including one in which he stormed off a Hartford, Connecticut, stage after being heckled. Sporting a more buff look but still chain-smoking cigarettes, Chappelle reportedly joked at Radio City about everything from the Donald Sterling controversy to life as a married father. And he appears to be unrepentant about his exit from his career -- and his return. ""There's a method to my madness,"" The Daily Beast quoted Chappelle as saying during his performance.

"(CNN) -- There's nothing like soaking in the hot springs while soaking in the culture of a place that loves its bathing. If you're traveling first class, why not head to Japan or Iceland to enjoy a country whose people celebrate the waters and can pinpoint their various healing properties? If domestic travel is more your speed and budget, there are delightful natural spas to be had in the United States. And to spend even more time in nature but less in dollars, camping near a historic hot springs may be the way to go. An elegant Japanese ryokan . While Japanese ryokans have traditionally served the weary traveler looking for an inn and a soak, some modern ryokans are offering a more luxurious experience. ""The finest ryokans are now very refined establishments which are the epitome of Japanese ""omotenashi,"" a spirit of hospitality that takes into account all aspects of the guest's experience,"" says Japan expert Duff Trimble. One Trimble's favorite ryokans, Bettei Senjyuan, offers more than the opportunity to rest and mingle. Located just outside of the town of Minakami, about two hours from Toyko, Senjyuan has private rooms with outdoor baths, spa treatments and public baths fed from nearby Mount Tanigawa. ""I love that Senjyuan is on its own private piece of land so it feels like a private retreat,"" said Trimble, president of Wabi-Sabi Japan, a Toronto-based travel agency which customizes trips to Japan. ""I also really like the excellent variety of very well-designed rooms which, most importantly, all have a private rotenburo (outdoor hot bath)."" Senjyuan offers several different room styles, including Western-style beds. While the ryokan has an English website, travelers should be prepared for limited English. Rates start at $450 per night and include breakfast, a full multiple-course dinner and a room attendant. Iceland's Blue Lagoon . Spa culture dominates Iceland, where locals soak and swim in naturally heated baths and pools all over the country. The Blue Lagoon, the nation's most famous hot spring spa, is an easy stopover because of its convenient location between the airport and the capital, Reykjavik. Icelandair offers an add-on package after landing or before departure. (Icelandair travelers on the way to another destination may stop in Iceland for up to seven nights without an additional airfare charge.) If you prefer simpler and less famous hot springs, try the new Laugarvatn Fontana spa. Fontana recently opened in the village of Laugarvatn, about 50 miles from Reykjavik. To mix with the locals at their hot springs or thermal-heated swimming pools, check the ""Swimming in Iceland"" website. There are about 150 thermal pools in Iceland and a similar number of natural bathing places or hot springs. Iceland's inside and outside pools are heated, and most of the bigger facilities include a sauna, slides and one or more hot tubs, ranging in temperature from 104Â° to 113Â° Fahrenheit, according to Swimming in Iceland's Robert van Spanje, whose website lists most of the natural springs and swimming pools in Iceland. Escape to the California desert . Surrounded by the desert and mountains, guests can soak in the three mineral water pools at the Spring Resort and Spa in Desert Hot Springs, California, about 20 minutes from Palm Springs. ""The water is amazing,"" says resort owner Maria Lease. ""The Spring Resort and Spa is located near the San Andreas Fault, and the water is actually held in place by the fault. It comes out at 170 degrees and it feels like silk."" Guests can enjoy the waters and spa services on site and head to Palm Springs for a swanky dinner experience. Get an aerial view of the desert on the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, a 10-minute ride up the Chino Canyon cliffs to an elevation of 8,500 feet. Active travelers can explore nearby Joshua Tree National Monument, Big Morongo Canyon Preserve or Indian tribal lands. Rates range from $119 to $279 per night. Steamboat Springs, Colorado . Skiers tired after a long day on the slopes can soak their tired bones at Strawberry Park Hot Springs before heading back to luxury digs at the Steamboat Grand Hotel. Those wishing for a more rustic experience can book the Caboose or other rustic cabins on site, starting at $70-$110 per night (reservations must be made by mail). Overnight guests must bring all food, swimsuits, seasonal gear and flashlights or headlamps. The springs are open daily, weeknights until 10 p.m. and weekends until midnight. (It's clothing optional after dark.) Locals recommend nighttime guests bring a flashlight to see the path to the springs. A four-wheel drive vehicle is required from November 1 to May 1 for two miles leading up to the springs, but shuttle services are available. Hot springs in town . Those craving a historic and affordable hot springs experience will find it at Hot Springs National Park in Arkansas, preserved in 1832 by President Andrew Jackson. The oldest of current National Park Service parks, it predates Yellowstone National Park by 40 years and the Park Service by 84 years. Dating back to 1912, the Buckstaff Bath House offers traditional whirlpool mineral baths and other services within the boundaries of the national park. Services start at $30. Gulpha Gorge Campground charges $10 per night for campers and $24 per night for hookups. No reservations are accepted at the bath house or campground.","Each room at the Senjyuan ryokan boasts a heated outdoor bath .

"(CNN) -- Part of the imagined charms of space flight is not just the view from the window. It is also the thrill of breaking the shackles of gravity and free-floating. Now taking a break from Newton's laws is easier (and cheaper) than ever. For years, the European Space Agency (ESA) has used a Novespace-owned Airbus to run parabolic, aka ""zero-gravity"" flights for scientists and astronauts-in-training. Last March, Novespace started selling seats to the general public for a relatively reasonable $7,932. ""I've been doing this for 20 years, and every flight, there's always this 'wow' impression,"" says Vladimir Pletser, the parabolic flight manager at the ESA, and a Guinness record holder for most aircraft flown in parabola. ""It's like you get born again in a new environment. Words are not enough to describe it. You have to live it."" ""Zero-gravity"" is a bit of a misnomer, as the Zero-G -- the Airbus A300 that performs the missions -- never leaves Earth's orbit. Rather, the weightless feeling is a result of the plane's parabolic flight path. The aircraft shoots up at a 47-degree angle at full engine thrust -- at which point everything inside the plane experiences hypergravity, and is heavier. The thrust is then reduced, and the plane is allowed to experience free fall, allowing everything inside to become weightless. ""Gravity does not disappear, but we are in a state of freefall,"" explains Pletser. ""With respect to the environment, which is the cabin, your weight will be zero. It's absolute magic."" Magical though it may be, the experience lasts a mere 20 seconds. To draw out the experience, the Zero-G needs to thrust up and fall down in a series of 30 parabolas (it's no wonder it's nicknamed the ""vomit comet."") The Zero-G has not abandoned its main purpose, however, which is to provide a handy gravity-free environment for scientists to conduct experiments. ""It is a beautiful opportunity,"" notes Jean-Louis Thonnard, a professor at Belgium's UniversitÃ© Catholique de Louvain who is researching gravity's effect on upper-body movement. ""By studying the manipulation of objects in different gravity fields, we understand how important gravity is on Earth,"" he explains. ""We are gravity dependent."" Sticking a scientist on a parabolic flight is considerably cheaper than sending them to the International Space Station, and many of the world's top space centers use Zero-G as a venue for the early stages of experimentation. It's no surprise that a lot of the research is space-themed. The International Space University in Strasbourg, for instance, is researching how gravity affects our everyday perception of objects in terms of weight and density. According to Leonardo Surdo, a researcher at the university, studies show that on Earth, when people are presented with two balls of equal weight, they will mistakenly assume the smaller one is heavier. This is known as size-mass illusion. Read more: Google explores the Airbus A380 . ""In microgravity, we don't have weight, just mass. It gives us the opportunity to see what the mechanism is underlying this illusion,"" says Surdo. In terms of real-world application, the experiment can help prevent accidents in space. ""We don't want astronauts to take different objects and smash them,"" he says. According to Pletser, allowing the public to board the plane is partly an educational enterprise. By interacting with scientists, they're able to better grasp the affects of microgravity. ""It allows them to have an experience of zero gravity, and to see what it's good for,"" he says.","Last March, Novespace started selling seats on their ""zero-gravity"" flights.
Planes that follow a parabolic flight path can mimic the feeling of entering a gravity-free zone.
Tickets cost $7,932 (cheaper than $250,000 for a seat on Virgin Galactic).
The flights are popular with scientists and astronauts-in-training."

"(CNN) -- CBS' newest ""How I Met Your Mother"" episode was supposed to serve as the latest and greatest installment in the series' ongoing gag about soundly, if humorously, slapping around a good friend. Only thing is, some in the Asian-American community saw it as a slap in the face. The sitcom's Monday show generated buzz on social media, but not for the reasons its creators intended. Instead, some reacted angrily to the decision to recast lead character actors -- all of them white -- in yellowface and to dress them in stereotypical Asian attire. 'DWTS' cohorts defend Julianne Hough's blackface costume . ""Yellowface? Orientalism? Fu Manchu? What?"" tweeted one person, referencing the term ""oriental"" that many Asian-Americans find offensive. ""Not okay @cbs."" On Wednesday, the creators of ""How I Met Your Mother,"" which is in its final season, acknowledged the controversy and that some people had been offended by the portrayals in the show. Carter Bays tweeted that the episode aimed to be a ""silly and unabashedly immature homage to Kung Fu movies."" But Bays added that some didn't see it as funny at all, and for that, ""We're deeply sorry."" ""We try to make a show that's universal, that anyone can watch and enjoy,"" Bays said, in remarks seconded by the show's co-creator, Craig Thomas. ""We fell short of that this week, and feel terrible about it."" The episode was titled ""Slapsgiving 3: Slappointment in Slapmarra,"" continuing a tradition on the series about solitary, powerful, ritual slaps among friends. This one starts with the main characters sitting in their favorite bar, with Marshall Eriksen (played by Jason Segel) explaining how he had sought out ""special training"" to deliver Barney Stinson (played by Neil Patrick Harris) an especially epic slap. Lawmaker apologizes for blackface costume . A kung fu master spurned his first attempt at instruction, explaining, ""Kung fu is an ancient and honorable martial art. It must be learned with great devotion and respect."" Then a young boy in the studio comes out of nowhere and tells Marshall how he can master ""the slap of a million exploding suns."" Despite Barney's disbelief, Marshall explains his yearlong journey to Shanghai and Cleveland getting schooled by three masters who teach him speed, strength and accuracy. Each of these masters are played not by Asian actors, but other actors on the series adorned in Asian garb, yellowface and, in one case, a Fu Manchu mustache. The episode climaxes 17 hours before the wedding of Barney, who receives a mighty slap that literally leaves him red in the face. Out of nowhere, the group Boyz II Men then comes out and signs about the ""so awesome"" slap. Some viewers reacted angrily to the episode the next day, including several who used the #HowIMetYourRacism hashtag. There were a number of people who rallied to the show's defense, saying people were overreacting. But others didn't think anything about the ordeal was funny, with some jabbing the program for its lack of minorities and playing up Asian stereotypes. ""Incredibly easy for white people to say 'that wasn't racist,'"" one person tweeted. ""Not so easy for PoC"" -- shorthand for people of color -- ""to be marginalized their entire life.""

"(CNN) -- Americans love roller coasters -- until something goes wrong. Attention turned to amusement park safety after a tree branch that fell on the tracks derailed a roller coaster car at a Six Flags amusement park Monday evening, leaving it dangling precariously and its occupants stranded for hours. Four people were injured on the Ninja ride at Six Flags Magic Mountain, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said. Two of the four were taken to a hospital as a precautionary measure. It was an amusement park enthusiast's nightmare. ""It was just a lot of leaf noise and then cracking noises and crashing noises and a lot of screaming,"" Brandy Chambers, who witnessed the incident from her vantage point on another ride, told CNN affiliate KTLA. But worldwide, such incidents are very rare, and attendance at amusement parks has been increasing, experts say. According to the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, there are 4.3 injuries per million attendees at U.S. fixed-site amusement parks, citing 2011 statistics. In 2011, the chance of being ""seriously injured"" at fixed-site amusement parks in the U.S. was 1 in 24 million, the IAAPA reported. Still, it's hard to ignore images of a roller coaster car filled with people, drooping from the track. The front part of the roller coaster detached from the track and dangled at about a 45-degree angle, pointing to the ground. The car was about 20 feet in the air, Los Angeles Fire Department supervisor Ed Pittmann told KTLA. Rescue workers climbed atop the track and used a thick rope to tie the front of the car to the track above. By late Monday night, all 22 passengers had been rescued. Twitter was abuzz Tuesday with people claiming they would never ride a roller coaster again. Six Flags Magic Mountain is the 18th most popular amusement park in North America, with more than 2.9 million visitors in 2013, according to the Themed Entertainment Association and AECOM global attractions attendance report. The index lists the 25 most visited amusement parks and theme parks worldwide, based on attendance figures compiled by AECOM.. The derailment happened after a tree branch fell on the track, obstructing the train, Six Flags Magic Mountain spokeswoman Sue Carpenter said. Six Flags describes the Ninja ride as a ""stealth assassin"" on its website. ""The black belt of roller coasters whips you into submission,"" the site says. Passengers ride the swinging coaster suspended from the track instead of riding on top of the track. The derailment is the latest in a series of high-profile roller coaster accidents in recent years. Last July, Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington shut down its Texas Giant roller coaster after a woman was thrown from her seat and plunged to her death. Between 1990 and 2010, more than 92,000 children were injured in amusement ride-related incidents, according to a study by the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio. That's an average of more than 4,000 injuries per year. The IAAPA had lower estimates for amusement park injuries -- falling from about 2,500 in 2001 to 1,200 in 2011. Safety is on the mind of riders following Monday's derailment, and the organization provides a number of common-sense safety tips. Among those: Obey age and height restrictions, keep arms and legs inside the ride, and report any unsafe behavior or condition to an attendant. The most insane roller coasters .

"(CNN) -- Leadership is a choice. Pure and simple. When you assume a position of authority, either formally as a manager or informally as a team leader, you make the choice to lead. Management is the discipline of getting things done right. Leadership is the art of doing what is right for good of the organization. In other words, management is execution; leadership is inspiration. Inspiration emerges from purpose, knowing what you do and why you do it. Organizational purpose emerges from the vision, mission and values of an organization. Apple is fine example of a purposeful organization. Its leadership under Steve Jobs at the helm was focused on producing well-designed products, easy to use as tools of productivity or means of entertainment. Everyone in Apple has been focused on this mission. You could say much the same about the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain. Everyone from top to bottom, and that includes maids and wait staff, knows how to deliver a superior guest experience. Among the ways leaders instill purpose in an organization, according to research conducted my book, Lead With Purpose, Giving Your Organization a Reason to Believe in Itself, is through communicating the vision, tying customer benefits to employee contributions, and linking work to results. Creating a purposeful organization is not easy. It takes the commitment of senior leaders who hold themselves accountable for delivering on the corporate mission. A fine example of this is Vineet Nayar, CEO of HCL Technologies, a global IT services company headquartered in Delhi. As Nayar wrote in his book, Employees First, Customers Second, ""The role of the CEO is to enable people to excel, help them discover their own wisdom, engage themselves entirely in their work, and accept responsibility for making change."" Toward that end, Nayar regards himself as a servant of his organization one who holds himself accountable for putting individuals and teams into positions where they can excel. Purpose is especially necessary in tough times. As Roger Webb, President of the University of Central Oklahoma, told me an in an interview: ""If people don't feel the purpose, and don't feel the goal and [know] that they are accomplishing things and moving forward, then depressing news can really bring people down."" While purpose is the spark that sets up the vision -- where an organization is headed -- and defines its mission, it becomes inert if not practiced. So a leader must ""connect the dots"" between what an employee does and why it matters to the organization. A key example of this is Ford Motor Company. Under the leadership of CEO Alan Mulally the organization has transformed itself from a struggling company to one that has become the most admired automaker. Key to this has been the One Ford plan, which is the relentless focus on creating cars and trucks that complement the Ford brand globally. The beauty of this imperative is not the words; it's the action steps. Employees throughout Ford understand the responsibility they have to deliver on One Ford. If you work in manufacturing you understand that decisions and actions you make complement Ford's ability to build world-class products. Or if you work in marketing, you know how your marketing plan for the Focus complement the strategic imperative. Put in other way, purpose becomes personal. Specificity is critical to purpose. I have developed two questions that managers can ask themselves to ensure that they are using purpose as a lever to effect positive results. The first, is asking oneself if you are teaching your staff about a purpose. Secondly, ask if you are ensuring your staff follow through on the shared purpose. Answers to these questions will enable the leader to provide his team with a goals. Ways to deliver on this will include briefings from senior management but it will more importantly involve having conversations about what the team is doing and why it matters. Stories about what is working or what is not can greatly contribute to a greater understanding of purpose. Leadership is a choice for individuals to make, but the leader must provide his or her team with clear direction founded on purpose and understanding.","John Baldoni believes leadership is a decision .

"(CNN) -- A year is a very long time on Mars -- 687 days. NASA's Curiosity rover can attest that it's enough time for some unexpected life changes. On Tuesday, the rover celebrated the Martian one-year anniversary of its touchdown on August 6, 2012. Looking back, some things have gone much better than anticipated, in spite of one nasty snag. Here's a look at some of Curiosity's accomplishments so far: . Signs of life . Its main mission: Find out whether Mars could have once hosted life -- small stuff like bacteria, viruses and fungus. A key ingredient for this would be signs that there was once water on the bone-dry red planet. Bam! Mission accomplished right off the bat. It was supposed to take longer. To find the answer, Curiosity was scheduled to take a hike up the slopes of Mars' Mount Sharp, a peak nearly as high as Earth's Mount McKinley, NASA said. But right where the rover landed, it stumbled upon an ancient riverbed. Not long after that, Curiosity's operators back on Earth pulled some dirt from Mar's Gale Crater, which is the rover's exploration areal. The samples revealed that water once on Mars had been the right kind to support life. It also found traces of chemicals microbes on Earth use. ""If Mars had living organisms, this would have been a good home for them,"" NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a statement. Wheels keep turning . That success didn't make the challenge of Mt. Sharp -- which is in the middle of Gale Crater -- go away. And on the way there, Curiosity hit that snag. It suffered wheel damage in late 2013, slowing down the rover's already tip-toe pace. Since it landed nearly 700 days ago, it has driven slightly less than five miles, and its operators are adjusting its itinerary to take it over less rugged terrains. Even with sensitive feet, like a resolute tourist in a foreign land, the rover is snapping lots of pictures. By August last year, it had sent more than 70,000 back to Earth. One of its first was a selfie to show it had made it to Mars. Artful hobbler . And Curiosity continues to poke around to see what it can find. It has fired its laser tens of thousands of times to help scientists analyze varieties of dirt and stone. And it has drilled for more signs of the previous existence of water. Scientists are still assessing the samples in hopes of finding out just how habitable Mars once was eons ago, NASA said. In the meantime, Curiosity has found another similarity to Earth in its drill bit, a mineral called orthoclase. It belongs to a class of minerals that makes up more than half of our planet's crust, and the rover pulled up a rich sample on Mars. The rover's drivers have decided to take it easy on Mt. Sharp, using cameras on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to map out a path on its lower slopes. But that's also making the paths longer. With its two camera eyes and block-shaped head atop a long shaft that looks like a neck, Curiosity has a somewhat humanized appearance akin to that of ET. Maybe it's a sign of things to come. During its flight to Mars and after its landing, it measured radiation levels. Scientist are using the measurements to determine how much protection would be required to send human astronauts to Mars. Scientists create a mini Mars on Earth .

"(CNN) -- Music and travel have always gone together. But if you were to name 12 great travel-inspired tracks from the last 20 years, where would you start? No, putting Enya on shuffle to transform 11 hours of bun-numbing economy class tedium into a ""spiritual journey"" doesn't count. You'd probably find it hard to start at all. While performers like Jay-Z and Alicia Keys continue to crank out tunes that celebrate destinations like New York, barely anyone seems to be writing great songs about travel any more. Once a life-changing event, leaving on a jet plane is now something everyone does, all the time. And it sucks. High fuel prices and dull highways means epic car journeys are often out of the question. And the only people still hopping freight trains inevitably wind up mangled in machinery. So, with due apologies for excessive wallowing in classic guitar licks of years gone by, please fasten your seatbelts and familiarize yourself with the safety procedures as we embark on a journey through the best travel tunes ever recorded. 12. Peter, Paul and Mary: 'Leaving on a Jet Plane' (1967) This wistful John Denver ballad telling the story of an achy-hearted traveler's sadness at leaving a loved one and not knowing ""when I'll be back again"" is an anthem for long-distance love. In these days of volcanic eruptions, angry passengers and unhelpful counter agents, it could simply be a mundane tirade against the uncertainties of commercial flying. Sad but apt fact: In one of popular music's most apt demises, Denver died when his experimental plane crashed into the Pacific Ocean. 11. I Nine: 'Same in Any Language' (2005) As a director, Cameron Crowe has become the modern bard of hits (""Jerry McGuire,"" ""Almost Famous"") and misses (""We Bought a Zoo""). As a compiler of soundtracks, we'd probably put him above Wes Anderson as the best in the biz. Though among his less celebrated films, 2005's ""Elizabethtown"" showcases one of his most memorable collections of excellent, semi-obscure tunes, highlighted by this strummy rocker about the gypsy lifestyle from South Carolina's critically acclaimed I Nine. The song takes us from Tripoli to Amsterdam to Birmingham, but finds that all of us share the universal desire of chatting up a Navajo in a parking lot in Tokyo. (Somehow this all works really, really well.) Whattya gonna do? fact: A great soundtrack couldn't hide the flaws in ""Elizabethtown,"" which gets just a 28% approval rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes. 10. Gene Pitney: '24 Hours from Tulsa' (1963) Clearly a song of its time, Gene Pitney's hit is a tale of unexpectedly falling in love a day's drive away from an existing relationship. It wouldn't happen today because the song's protagonist would have hopped onto a budget airline and made the journey in a couple of hours -- although he could perhaps have squeezed in a quick flirtation with the woman in seat 16B who was giving him those looks ... Slightly tasteless fact: The Welsh hotel room where Pitney died of heart failure in 2006 was about 24 hours' travel time from Tulsa. 9. Iggy Pop: 'The Passenger' (1977) Not to be confused with Elton John's execrable 1984 song ""Passengers,"" or the 2003 album ""Passenger"" by Swedish nu metal band ""Passenger,"" Iggy's restless punk anthem cleaves a ragged path through the dark heart of an unexplored urban landscape -- or at least it used to until it was appropriated (with lucrative results for Mr. Pop no doubt) to peddle cars, Guinness and cosmetics. Sell-out fact: Apparently no longer content to be a passenger, Iggy himself -- old, wrinkled but still shirtless -- once advertised car insurance in the United Kingdom. 8. M.I.A.: 'Paper Planes' (2008) Before you start hurling heavy objects at your screen, hear us out. Yes, this might be a feeble attempt to keep this list current, but M.I.A.'s melodic mash-up of The Clash's ""Straight to Hell"" and Wreckx-n-Effect's ""Rumpshaker"" is about travel. Sure, M.I.A.'s incoherent polemics on global oppression create as many critics as fans, and all the edgy stuff about visas and hustling on ""Paper Planes"" is somewhat undone by the misfiring irony of the song's cartoon violence -- but there's no avoiding the fact it was a solid platinum hit. Undiplomatic fact: M.I.A.'s strident support for Sri Lanka's Tiger Tamil fighters led to her being branded a ""terrorist sympathizer"" by the island's government. 7. The Go-Go's: 'Vacation' (1982) This splash of California sunshine unabashedly wallows in the giddy romance of a holiday fling without coming to terms with the fact that -- this being the 1980s -- he was just some sleazeball waiter who probably beds a different girl group every week. Go-Go's guitarist Jane Wiedlin gets extra travel points for her 1985 solo single ""Rush Hour"" and her cameo in ""Bill and Ted's Big Adventure."" Surprising subcontinental fact: Lead singer Belinda Carlisle now has a home in Goa, India. 6. Simon and Garfunkel: 'Homeward Bound' (1966) This great travel song celebrates the tedium of being stuck in a dead-end en route to somewhere slightly better, which as any passenger knows, is half the fun. Another contender from S&G is ""America,"" veering off the beaten track to name-check the workmanlike destinations of Pittsburgh, Saginaw and New Jersey. ""Homeward Bound"" is a candid admission that being on the road blows and you've had enough. Boo hoo hoo. Dirty fact: ""Homeward Bound"" was reputedly penned by Paul Simon after he was stranded for the night at Widnes station in England. Widnes' only other significant export is pollution. 5. Hoodoo Gurus: '1,000 Miles Away' (1991) Australia's occasionally be-paisleyed, troubadoring Gurus may have been using travel as a metaphor for the emotional distance that being away from home can inflict . But with references to ""spending half my life in airports doing crosswords and attempting to sleep"" and the soul-crushing burn that accompanies life ""at the bottom the corporate tree,"" this paean to airport barstools and estimated times of arrival is the weary road warrior's most sympathetic anthem. Nautical fact: The crew of the Australian Royal Navy frigate HMAS Canberra declared ""1,000 Miles Away"" its unofficial theme song during the ship's last voyage before being decommissioned in 2005. 4. Bob Dylan: 'Tangled Up in Blue' (1975) In truth you could conjure up a whole album of restless whines from the king of modern folk rock. Tunes like ""Blowin' in the Wind"" and ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"" inspired legions of disenfranchised youths to make tracks, even if no one really knew what Bob was on about. There's more clarity to be had from ""Rolling Stone,"" even if he resorts to harping on about ""clowns and jugglers"" yet again. But nothing rivals the epic trans-U.S. poetry of ""Tangled."" Acting fact I: Dylan won an Oscar in 2000 for ""Things Have Changed,"" featured in the movie ""Wonder Boys."" Just as well, since his woeful attempts at acting would never make the grade. 3. Willie Nelson: 'On the Road Again' (1980) American national treasure Willie Nelson doesn't mess around with Dylanesque whimsy in this straightforward classic that does exactly what it says on the cover. It's called ""On the Road Again"" and it's about being on the road again. Hopefully Nelson isn't driving though. After arrests for marijuana and mushroom possession, it's perhaps better if one of his friends takes the wheel. Acting fact II: Unlike Dylan, Nelson can act. Not that he needs to in movies like ""Dukes of Hazzard."" 2. Bruce Springsteen: 'Born to Run' (1975) On the face of it, a rollicking love song for a girl going by the unlikely name of Wendy, but in truth a desperate anthem about getting the hell out of nowheresville (in Springsteen's case, Asbury, New Jersey), with the disaffected howl of ""We gotta get out while we're young, 'cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run."" Career fact: A frustrated Springsteen recorded ""Born to Run"" as a final effort to hit the big time. Apparently it worked. Steppenwolf: 'Born to be Wild' (1968) The ultimate open-road song. Steppenwolf's full-throttled cover version would be a perfect checklist for the rock 'n 'roll voyager, if having a checklist wasn't so un-rock 'n' roll. ""Get your motor running"" -- check. ""Head out on the highway"" -- check. ""Looking for adventure"" -- check. You get the idea. Mind you, it's been so worn out over the years that the only people still listening to it are graying oldies whose checklist is more likely to include things like blood-pressure pills, sensible shoes and a hernia truss. Not-so-wild fact: Despite being classed as one of the first heavy metal bands, Steppenwolf were originally called The Sparrows. Doesn't quite have the same ring does it? Updated with new songs from a story originally published in 2011.","A journey through the best travel tunes ever recorded .

"Washington (CNN) -- In an unprecedented action, an Air Force commander has stripped 17 of his officers of their authority to control and launch nuclear missiles. The 17 are being sent to undergo 60 to 90 days of intensive refresher training on how to do their jobs. The action comes after their unit performed poorly on an inspection and one officer was investigated for potential compromise of nuclear launch codes, according to Lt. Col. John Dorrian, an Air Force spokesman. The story was first reported by The Associated Press. The action was taken by the deputy commander of the 91st Operations Group, Lt. Col. Jay Folds, whose officers run launch control centers for the Minuteman III nuclear missiles from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota. Folds announced the action in an emotionally charged April e-mail to his unit, saying in part, ""Did you know that we, as an operations group, have fallen -- and its it time to stand ourselves back up?"" In that e-mail, Folds said, ""We're discovering such rot in the crew force,"" while they are on alert status -- standing watch over the nuclear force -- that the unit is accepting of violations of weapons safety rules, and code compromises. In words not often used by military officers, Folds told his troops to ""crush any rules violators"" and said, ""We are, in fact, in a crisis right now."" CNN obtained a copy of the e-mail, which was also first obtained by the AP. Dorrian confirmed that Folds was referring to a potential deliberate violation of Air Force rules regarding nuclear launch codes and the failure of his troops to report when they see potential violations. The Air Force action affects only the 17 personnel deemed to need the training; others remain on duty. The unit underwent a regular comprehensive inspection in March, according to Dorrian. The inspection consisted of an evaluation of 22 tasks. At the time, the unit was announced as having passed with a ""satisfactory"" rating, which is third on a scale of five. But on one of the 22 tasks involving launch operations, it was rated ""marginal"" which is one step above ""unsatisfactory."" Dorrian called it the equivalent of a ""D"" grade. Then the incident of potential compromise of launch codes occurred. Dorrian said the investigation found no compromise, but did find the codes were ""potentially handled improperly,"" by one officer, who is now facing discipline. All of this then led to Folds' e-mail and action, according to Dorrian. Dorrian noted that while some in the Air Force might view Folds' e-mail as ""emotional,"" his actions are fully supported at the highest levels of the Air Force. In other portions of his e-mail Folds told his unit: . -- ""Turn off the TVs."" -- ""Clean your patches, uniforms and get your hair cut."" -- ""Bring to my attention immediately any officer who bad mouths a senior officer."" While some nuclear officers are sent for retraining every year, this is the most extensive action taken to date, Dorrian confirmed. It comes after a 2008 Pentagon report was sharply critical of the Air Force for not focusing on the post-Cold War nuclear mission, and for a bomber that, in a flight over multiple states, carried nuclear-tipped missiles without the Air Force realizing it.

"(CNN) -- Neuroscience may not be for everyone. But Backyard Brains co-founder Greg Gage hopes to make it a little less intimidating and a lot more accessible. Gage believes that basic neuroscience research is the answer to curing many of the most devastating neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Greg Gage and his partner Tim Marzullo hope to make learning about the brain easy and accessible for all ages and income levels. With a simple do-it-yourself approach they started a company that creates affordable kits for learning about the brain. Gage hopes to show students that neuroscience can be fun and, in the process, inspire the next generation of neuroscientists. One of the products they designed, called the SpikerBox, allows users to record and stimulate neurons from things such as insects and display the neural activity on devices like iPhones via custom apps. Gage hopes that with these tools, kids of all ages will be able to learn about how the brain communicates. A short video recently posted by Backyard Brains showing squid skin cells stimulated by an iPod has been a hit on YouTube -- evidence that this visual and interactive approach to neuroscience can appeal to the masses. Through these simple, entry-level devices created from off-the-shelf electronics, Backyard Brains hopes to inspire the next generation of neuroscientists and start the ""neuro-revolution."" Gage sat down with CNN at TED 2012 in Long Beach, California, to talk about Backyard Brains. CNN: Tell us about why you started Backyard Brains? Gage: The idea was that we wanted to take really expensive and really complicated neuroscience techniques and make it easy enough and affordable enough that you can use it in high school and even down to the fifth-grade level. CNN: Why is teaching neuroscience important? Gage: Because one out of five of us, that's 20% of the entire world, will be diagnosed with a neurological disorder, and when it comes to treating these diseases, we're in the dark ages. The only way to get out of it is through basic neuroscience research. By reaching back into the education process early you can get kids interested in the brain. We want to make kits that get kids interested and working with the brain so they get turned on to that and want to become that in the future. CNN: What do you hope to accomplish with Backyard Brains in the future? Gage: These (SpikerBoxes) are just the beginning of where we want to go. We want to bring the technology that just came out a few years ago in the latest fields like optogenetics and bring that into the high school classroom. In the next 10 to 15 years we want professors to tell us that the number of applicants that come into the lab that have already done experiments or that have already been thinking about this for years is on the rise. We want to start to have the ""neuro-revolution"" by having new students that are already interested in the brain beginning to understand and solve the diseases that we have today. We just really need to push the science further to help us cure these diseases.

"(CNN) -- â€ªIndia: you either love it or hate it. Or one day you wake up and realize where you fit into India and where India fits into you. The country of 1.2 billion draws more than 7 million tourists a year, but there's far more to gain than spiritual enlightenment and an expanded waistline. Home to 28 states and 7 union territories, India contains more than 800 dialects and can lay claim to some of the most varied sites in the world. From Kerala's backwaters to Tamil Nadu's temples, and Rajasthan's deserts to Kanchenjunga, the third highest mountain in the world, there are endless superlatives to go around. Here are 10.

That's just the beginning. Once the customer is shorn, wet-wiped and toweled off, barbers begin a firm head, neck and shoulder massage, which can descend into facial slapping and skull-pounding known as ""champi,"" which is where the word ""shampoo"" comes from. Be warned: their signature move is a swift neck crack, which can come as a shock to first-timers. More: Insider Guide: Best of Mumbai . 2. Enterprising street vendors .

This year marks 160 years since the birth of Indian Railways, which carries more than 20 million passengers a day along 65,000 kilometers of track. Thundering through cities, inching past villages, snaking along coastlines and climbing mountains, the network of toy trains, luxury trains, Shatabdi speed trains and commuter trains is lovingly known as ""the lifeline of a nation."" In terms of safety, however, there's still far to go, owing to the trains' decrepit state, unmanned crossings and lack of government attention.

Hollywood stars have nothing on Bollywood stars when it comes to entourages, paparazzi and fanatic followings. They might endorse skin-lightening creams, produce terrible films and become embroiled in one scandal after another, but almost nothing can't dim their stardom. Current fave Sunny Leone -- a former pediatric nurse trainee in Orange Country turned porn star and now mainstream actress -- is the most searched celebrity on the Internet, racking up 35 million searches in India this year. 5. Accessorizing . From Hyderabad pearls to Jaipuri gems, intricate Indian jewelry is coveted the world over, and local women are usually dripping in it. In the markets in Rajasthan, maids sweep temples and Rabari tribeswomen in Gujarat effortlessly carry buckets, mop floors and balance heavy loads -- all while wearing five-inch diameter nose rings, toe-rings, glass bangles to the elbow and gold necklaces swinging by their bellies.

From Mumbai's Mohammed Ali Road for kebabs to Amritsar's Lawrence Road for Makhan Fish, India's addictive food leaves no room for worries over waistlines. Steaming chicken kathi rolls, crunchy sweet and sour bhel puri or creamy lassi from even the starkest of roadside shacks are bewilderingly tasty and satisfying. 7. Gesticulating . India has more than 800 dialects, but it's the head-shaking and wrist-flicking gestures that are the most dramatic means of communication and an inherent part of an Indian's genetic makeup. In South India, pointing a thumb toward the mouth can mean anything from ""what do you want?"" to ""have you eaten?"" To make matters more confusing, Indians will often shake their heads from right to left to signify that they are, in fact, following what you're saying and agreeing, rather than disagreeing. 8. Obsessing over cricket . When the British left India, they left two real legacies: the railways and cricket. Not just the preserve of the upper classes wearing club ties, drinking Pimms and eating cucumber sandwiches, cricket in India is a way of life, enjoyed by every class, age and sex, while cricketers are revered as gods. Watching a live Indian Premier League match is a nighttime floodlit spectacle featuring semi-clad cheerleaders, fog horns, fireworks in the crowds, drummers and, of course, with a brand value of just less than $3 billion, a lot of extravagantly rich cricket players. More: 9 of the world's most heated rivalries (including India vs. Pakistan cricket) 9. Festivals . With so many religions and cultures existing side by side in India, it's rare for a week to go by without some sort of celebration. Indians will normally extend invitations to anyone and everyone from next door neighbors to stray travelers who they may have met that morning on a train. It's wise to bring along a change of clothes when invited to share mutton biryani during Eid or set off Lakshmi banger fireworks in the street at Diwali or be doused in colored water during Holi, the festival of spring.

Hidden between the jungle-topped Sahyadri hills 80 kilometers east of Mumbai, it was originally used by the British to escape the Bombay heat, and is free from fume-spewing vehicles while being accessible on horseback, on foot or by the narrow-gauge toy train that trundles along tiny tracks.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Heather Mills, the estranged wife of Paul McCartney, was granted nearly £25 million ($50 million) in her divorce proceedings with the former Beatle, she said Monday. Mills and McCartney, pictured before divorce proceedings, married in 2002 and have a young daughter. Mills said she will not appeal the award, but she will appeal the publication of the hearing transcript, which she said McCartney has asked for. In an 11-minute statement to reporters outside the High Court after the verdict, Mills said she was pleased that the bitter divorce hearings had ended. ""I'm so glad it's over and it was an incredible result, in the end, to secure my and my daughter's future, and that of all the charities that I obviously plan on helping,"" said Mills, dressed in a khaki, green and blue suit with a bright red shirt. Mills has established a career as a campaigner and charity worker since losing a leg in a road accident in 1993.  Watch Mills react to the decision » . Judge Hugh Bennett awarded Mills, who represented herself, £24.3 million  ($48.6 million), according to the court's release. She had sought an award of nearly £125 million ($251 million), the court said. McCartney had proposed £15.8 million ($31.6 million), it said. Read the court's statement . The judgment included £35,000 ($70,000) a year for the couple's 4-year-old daughter, Beatrice. Mills said she was unhappy with that amount because it isn't enough for school tuition, private security, or first-class airfare. ""He likes her to fly five times a year on holiday,"" Mills said of McCartney. ""It's £17,000 for two people return (round-trip) first class, so that's obviously not meant to happen for her anymore. It's very sad."" According to the court's release, the award includes £600,000 ($1.2 million) a year for Mills and £2.5 million ($5 million) for her to purchase property in London. Mills said she would appeal to stop the publication of the entire judgment because it contains private details about Beatrice and she doesn't want them released. The judge has granted permission for the litigants to speak publicly, she said.  Watch how the McCartney/Mills court battle may not be over » . McCartney did not speak to reporters after the verdict. Mills said that as a ""litigant in person,"" or a litigant representing herself, the system worked against her at every turn. ""These people are in a club,"" she said. ""It's like they want to stay together and they don't want to see a litigant in person doing well."" She said the judge did not agree with her on important details, including how long the couple lived together or even McCartney's personal wealth, which she estimated at £800 million ($1.6 billion). She said the judge estimated it to be half of that. ""I won't go into all the horrific details of what happened because I'm just glad it's over,"" Mills said. ""I really hope now that me and my daughter can have a life and not be followed every single day, and that is why I've come out -- to give it closure."" McCartney and Mills failed to agree on a settlement ending their four-year marriage in divorce hearings last month, leaving the judge to decide the terms. McCartney and Mills married in 2002 after meeting at a charity event. At the time of their split in 2006, they described it as amicable, despite widespread reports of a tempestuous relationship between McCartney and the former model. Mills has since lashed out at news media coverage of the divorce, which she said has been unfair to her and driven her to the brink of suicide. In a television interview last year, Mills said she had endured ""18 months of abuse, worse than a murderer or pedophile."" Monday's divorce settlement fell short of the previous record for a litigated divorce settlement in Britain. An award of £48 million ($96 million) was handed down last year, according to British divorce lawyer Julian Lipson.

"Centennial, Colorado (CNN) -- Colorado movie shooting suspect James Holmes was charged Monday with 24 counts of first-degree murder -- two counts for each of the 12 people killed in the shooting. Twelve of the murder counts cite ""deliberation,"" and 12 cite ""extreme indifference"" to the value of human life. The 24-year-old former doctoral student also was charged with 116 counts of attempted murder -- two for each of the 58 moviegoers wounded in the attack. Finally, he was charged with one count of felony possession of explosive devices and one count related to the use of an assault weapon, a shotgun and a handgun during the incident. The 142 counts are all in connection with the July 20 massacre in the Century Aurora 16 multiplex minutes into a midnight screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Shackled around his wrists and ankles, Holmes was escorted into Arapahoe County Courthouse by two sheriffs deputies. Five other sheriffs deputies were standing in the courtroom. Court appearance fuels theories about Colorado shooting suspect . In his first court appearance last week, Holmes appeared dazed and did not speak. During Monday's hearing, meanwhile, he seemed calm and frail, sitting at the right edge of the defense table with his dyed-orange hair matted on top, its roots dark. For a while, he stared blankly at the judge's bench but appeared to be aware of what was going on. When the judge asked him whether he understood why his attorneys were asking for more time before a hearing, he said softly, ""Yes."" About half of the approximately 120 seats in the courtroom were filled with victims or their family members; more watched on video in an overflow room. One young man in the front row of the courtroom leaned forward and stared at Holmes without averting his gaze throughout the 45-minute proceeding. Read the charges (PDF) Another observer, her left arm and leg in bandages, sat slumped in her seat. Around her wrist was a hospital wristband. ""It was very important to come today to see him as who he was,"" MaryEllen Hansen told reporters outside the courthouse. ""I really wanted an opportunity to watch his gestures (and) study him as much as I could."" Her niece's 6-year-old daughter, Veronica Moser-Sullivan, was the youngest person killed in the rampage. Hansen's niece, Ashley Moser, faces a long recovery after being paralyzed in her lower half and miscarrying after the shooting. ""I got a sense that he was very aware of what was going on,"" Hansen said of Holmes. ""He had an expression and kind of a persona of evilness to him. But he looked very sane to me, he really did."" Asked if she favors the death penalty, the retired school principal said, ""I'm a Christian and I do believe that he should probably be locked away and live with what he did every day of his life."" Background of suspect full of contrasts . Arapahoe County District Attorney Carol Chambers said last Monday that it will take time for prosecutors to decide whether or not they will pursue the death penalty, since they'd first want to get input from victims and their relatives. Authorities have remained silent about a possible motive in the case. A court document filed Friday revealed that Holmes was a patient of a University of Colorado psychiatrist before the attack. The disclosure was made in a filing by Holmes' public defenders requesting that authorities hand over a package he sent to Dr. Lynne Fenton at the university's Anschutz Medical Campus, where he had been studying neuroscience before announcing earlier this month that he was withdrawing from the program. The package seized by authorities under a July 23 search warrant should remain confidential, protected by the doctor-patient relationship because ""Holmes was a psychiatric patient of Fenton,"" the request said. In response, prosecutors asked Arapahoe County District Judge William Sylvester to deny Holmes' request, saying it contained inaccuracies including claims of media leaks by government officials that in reality may have been fabricated by news organizations. The package is expected to be the focus of a status hearing set for August 9. Prosecutors say they will begin turning over thousands of pages of discovery in the next couple of days. The defense says they need this information to prepare for the hearing. Warning signs of violence: What to do . During the week of November 12, attorneys expect a preliminary hearing and an evidence hearing that will include several days of testimony. As Monday's hearing unfolded, 10 survivors remained hospitalized, three of them in critical condition. But there was some progress: The day began at the University of Colorado Hospital at Aurora, for instance, with three in critical, one in serious and one in fair condition and ended with two in critical and three in fair condition. Meanwhile, those affected continued to come to grips with the horror. On Saturday alone, memorial services were held for four people killed in the massacre including two men -- Matt McQuinn from Ohio and Alex Teves from Arizona -- who died shielding their girlfriends from gunfire. Closer to Aurora, which is just east of Denver, people worked to make sense of what happened and support one another. For some, that includes making sure the shooting suspect knows that they are stronger, better and united. ""The man was a coward. We're here to show that we have strength and that we're willing to fight back,"" said Don Lader, after attending Monday's court hearing. ""He looked defeated,"" Lader added about Holmes, ""and he knows that he's not the one with power anymore -- that's us."" Remembering the victims through stories, photos .

"(CNN) -- They've long been considered topics that aren't polite to discuss at the dinner table. As it turns out, politics and religion can get touchy on Wikipedia as well. The two topics dominated a list of the most controversial pages on the crowdsourced Web encyclopedia. Topping the English-language version of the list? Former President George W. Bush. To determine the most controversial pages, researchers from Oxford University looked at their number of ""reverts"" -- instances in which an editor changes something on a page, only to have someone else come along and change it back to the previous wording. Alongside Bush, the political philosophy of anarchism made the list. So did global warming and the United States -- two topics that, while not exclusively political, certainly have political elements. As for religion, Mohammed, Jesus and Christianity were all among the top 10. Circumcision and ""race and intelligence,"" both with obvious controversy attached, made the list, alongside a possibly more surprising page: a list of professional wrestlers on the roster of World Wrestling Entertainment. The authors of the study, which will be part of an upcoming book, said that on a site as expansive and ambitious as Wikipedia, disagreements are bound to happen. ""While the common aim in the collaboration is clear, unavoidably differences in opinions and views occur, leading to controversies,"" they wrote. ""Clearly, there is a positive role of the conflicts: if they can be resolved in a consensus, the resulting product will better reflect the state of the art than without fighting them out. ""However, there are examples, where no hope for a consensus seems in sight -- then the struggle strongly limits efficiency."" The guiding principle behind Wikipedia, which launched in 2001, is cooperation. The thinking is that with a team of volunteer editors spanning the globe, rough edges will eventually be smoothed out and good information will triumph over falsehoods and misinterpretations. With more than 470 million unique visitors monthly, Wikipedia is one of the most-visited sites on the Web. It's written and edited collaboratively by Internet volunteers, most of them anonymous. According to its own pages, the site has more than 77,000 active contributors working on more than 22 million articles in 285 languages. By default, any change that an editor makes on the site is published immediately, subject to cleaning up by editors who come afterward. But disagreements, even among well-meaning editors, are bound to happen and, over the years, Wikipedia has adopted rules to deal with them. On the English-language version, only registered users may create new articles. And certain controversial pages get ""protection"" -- either full protection, which means they can only be edited by administrators, or semi-protection, under which they can only be edited by logged-in users whose accounts have been verified. When pages become home to ""edit wars,"" as the entries for Bush and Democratic rival John Kerry did during the 2004 election, they may be given temporary protection by administrators. On the English-language version of the site, sweeping issues such as religion dominated the most-disputed list. But the study's authors noted that with most other languages, more local or regional topics prevailed. ""The English Wikipedia, in particular, occupies a unique role,"" they wrote. ""The language's status as a 'lingua franca' (a widely used working language) means that English Wikipedia ends up being edited by a broad community beyond simply (those) that have the language as a mother tongue."" In German, the page on Croatia was the most controversial, with Adolf Hitler, Scientology and Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner making the top 10. Socialist politician Segolene Royal topped the French list (followed, curiously, by UFOs) and ""Gypsy crime"" topped the Hungarian list. In an interesting look at cultural interests, five of the 10 most disputed pages in Spanish were those of soccer teams -- Club America, Athletic Bilbao, Newell's Old Boys, FC Barcelona and Alianza Lima.","George W.

"(CNN) -- The lesbian widow of an Afghanistan war soldier has announced that her wait to see if she would receive the same benefits as heterosexual spouses has finally ended. Over wild applause at a Washington dinner Saturday honoring gay military families, Tracy Dice Johnson said that the Department of Veterans Affairs had reviewed her case and decided to grant her benefits, according a release about the event on the Defense Department's website. A North Carolina National Guardsman and Iraq war veteran, she was married to her longtime love, National Guard Staff Sgt. Donna Johnson. Donna Johnson, 29, was killed in October 2012, when a suicide bomber attacked a checkpoint she was helping to set up in Khost, according to a CNNMoney article published in March. At the time the story published, nine months had gone by since the Supreme Court had made it possible for same-sex couples who were previously denied federal benefits to begin receiving them. Johnson's request had not been denied, but she had applied twice and had received only letters saying that her request was being reviewed. Johnson was honored at the American Military Partner Association's inaugural National Gala Dinner where she told the audience that the VA had ""decided to retroactively recognize me,"" the Defense Department release says. The widow thanked her ""family"" within the American Military Partner Association. Members of the group were there for her, she said, when the ""unthinkable happened and continue to be there for me and others as we serve."" Rosemary Freitas Williams, deputy assistant secretary of defense for military community and family policy, said the Pentagon has begun several programs that will help to ensure that service members have full access to benefits that the law affords them. ""Our military will no longer be deprived of the talents and skills of patriotic Americans just because they happen to be gay or lesbian,"" Williams said. ""And now we can say of our military spouses and partners, 'Welcome aboard.'""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Kansas Senate seat that Republicans have controlled for the past 80 years looks like it could be in trouble, a new poll finds. Independent candidate Greg Orman now has a 10-point lead in his campaign to unseat three-term incumbent Sen. Pat Roberts, according to a NBC News/Marist poll released Sunday. The survey of 636 likely Kansas voters has Orman with 48 percent of the vote to Roberts' 38 percent of the vote, outside of the poll's 3.9 percentage point margin of error. That represents a five- to 10-point gain for the independent candidate, with polling over the last month judging the race anywhere from a dead heat to a five-point advantage for Orman. Roberts' campaign bringing major players to Kansas . The latest poll, which was conducted between Sept. 27 and Oct. 1, comes after a push from national Republicans to bolster Roberts with several Washington campaign operatives, who have helped develop a new, more direct campaign strategy: painting Orman as a Democrat in disguise. Democrats have placed their bets on an Orman victory, going so far as to pull their own nominee from the race to give Orman a better shot at unseating Roberts. Taking out a Republican senator, without a Democrat on the ballot . And while Orman hasn't said which party he will caucus with if he makes it to Congress, Roberts' campaign has done more than suggest Orman will join forces with Democrats, even calling Orman ""Obama's candidate for Senate"" in a recent ad. NBC News/Marist polling released Sunday also gave Democratic Senator Kay Hagan an edge over her Republican rival Thom Tillis, a good sign for Democrats in a toss-up state that could be crucial to determining the balance of the Senate. Hagan leads with 44 percent of the vote to Tillis' 40 percent, but within the polls' 3.8 percentage point margin of error. And in the neck-in-neck Iowa Senate contest, NBC News/Marist polling reports that the race is still a statistical dead heat, with Ernst leading by two points but within the 3.5 percentage point margin of error. Ernst has 46 percent of the vote, according to the poll, to Braley's 44 percent of the vote.","A new poll finds independent Greg Orman has a 10-point lead against Republican Pat Roberts.

"(CNN) -- Are the days of Latinos in entertainment changing their given names to appeal to a broader audience long gone? That's what it looks like now that former ""Two and a Half Men"" star Charlie Sheen has dropped his stage name for birth name Carlos Estevez for Robert Rodriguez's Latino-centric new action film ""Machete Kills."" The film is second in a series after the 2010 film ""Machete"" starring Danny Trejo, Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriguez. In ""Machete Kills,"" Trejo returns as ex-Federal agent Machete, recruited by the president of the United States, played by Charlie Sheen, asked to go on a mission to take down a madman revolutionary and eccentric billionaire arms dealer, played by Mel Gibson, who has come up with a plan to spread war across the world. This second installment will star Sofía Vergara, Demián Bichir, Antonio Banderas, Zoe Saldaña, Edward James Olmos, Vanessa Hudgens, Cuba Gooding Jr., Alexa Vega, and Lady Gaga. Watch the trailer for 'Machete Kills' According to Sheen's representative, it was his idea to use his birth name for the film. However, there's no confirmation on what spurred the decision or whether Sheen will stick to Estevez from now on. Some call the change ironic in light of comments last year by Sheen about his heritage. ""I don't wake up feeling Latino. I'm a white guy in America, I was born in New York and grew up in Malibu,"" he said in a 2012 interview with Univision. ""People are either going to see Charlie Sheen's move as pandering or as a smart career move considering the film's audience. I see it as him integrating himself into Latino culture,"" said Gabriel Reyes, president of Reyes Entertainment, a public relations and marketing agency. ""I'm sure he meant what he said in his interview with Univision, but that doesn't mean hce's not Hispanic, so if he wants to acknowledge it now, I applaud that."" The film's Twitter page has also re-tweeted articles about Sheen changing his name to Estevez for the movie. The movie's Facebook page posted a promotional photo of Sheen as Carlos Estevez with a caption that reads, ""Call him Carlos. Charlie Sheen is going FULL Latino in Machete Kills. SHARE this to introduce Carlos Estevez to your friends."" On Facebook, Jessica Chrisman posted: ""I love that he is using his real name,"" while Sasha Estella Videz disagreed, posting, ""So, he's finally getting in touch with his Latin roots... Sorry, 'Carlos' you should've stuck with your brother Emilio who didn't deny his roots to get more work."" Michelle Herrera Mulligan, editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan for Latinas, said: ""Hispanics might feel that his move might be a bit opportunistic on his part because he had many chances to embrace his Latino identity in the past. Especially since Sheen's brother, Emilio Estevez, has embraced his Hispanic identity from the very beginning."" The Sheen/Estevez family has been at odds over their identity over the years. In a 2003 ""Inside the Actors Studio"" interview, Martin Sheen talked about why he dropped his birth name, Ramon Antonio Gerard Estevez, but how he was always proud of his Hispanic heritage. He said he felt a ""hesitation whenever he would give his name over the phone for a job or apartment"" and by the time he would get there in person, ""it was always gone"" so he made up the name Martin Sheen. ""It's still Estevez officially. I never changed it. I never will. It's on my driver's license and passport and everything,"" Martin Sheen said to James Lipton. ""In fact, one of my great regrets is that I didn't keep my name as it was given to me."" Sheen passed on ""Estevez"" to his four children: Emilio, Ramón, Renée and Carlos (Charlie Sheen). Sheen wrote a memoir with his son Emilio called ""Along the Way,"" which covers the family's roots in Spain and their relationship as father and son. ""I chose to stay with my family name because, first of all, Emilio Sheen looks stupid. Right? And it's just not who I am, man,"" Emilio Estevez said in an interview with Latina magazine. ""The Latino community has always been very supportive of that choice and very proud of me that I chose to go with that -- and honor my Latino roots."" But he said he faced pressure from executives to change his name. He said his father's best advice was to not make the same mistake he made, because he would regret it for the rest of his life. ""The gringos and the suits in Hollywood gave me some pressure to change it because it made their jobs more difficult to try and sell me, but I'm so proud that I didn't. And, now of course it's very fashionable to be Latino. I guess it was a good choice back then!"" Martin Sheen wasn't the only actor in Hollywood to change his name. Once upon a time, Rita Hayworth was Rita Cansino. The ""Gilda"" star not only changed her hair color -- from natural dark brown to dark red -- but also her name to help her land a broader range of roles. Perhaps Jo Raquel Tejada, known by Hollywood as Raquel Welch, would have never made the big screen had she kept her original name. Vanna White of ""Wheel of Fortune"" adopted her stepfather's name, Herbert Stackley White Jr. If she'd kept her father's name, she would be Vanna Rosich after her Puerto Rican father, Miguel Angel Rosich. Let's not forget family comedy classic ""Growing Pains,"" starring TV mom Joanna Kerns, whose birth name was Joanna Crussie DeVarona. Anthony Quinn, born Antonio Rodolfo Quinn-Oaxaca, is a two-time Academy Award-winning Mexican-American actor and writer best known for his roles in ""Viva Zapata!"" in 1952 and ""Lust for Life"" in 1956. In the 1950s, upon getting a record deal, Richie Valens was asked to change his name, then Ricardo Valenzuela, by his manager because of fear that mainstream America wouldn't be receptive to the Mexican-American rock star. ""I can understand why Martin Sheen would have pressure to change his name because he went into Hollywood at a different time,"" said Cosmo editor Herrera Mulligan. ""It would be easier to see why Martin Sheen had to change versus Charlie Sheen's situation. It's 2013, Latinos have been hot about 10 times."" About 10 years ago, Herrera Mulligan worked at Latina magazine when ""everybody wanted to be Latino."" She recalls getting constant calls from PR agencies pitching their clients who weren't Latino but wanted to be in the magazine because they wanted to be affiliated with the audience. ""His name change attests to a greater trend. Hollywood is starting to see that Latinos in the U.S. are not just foreigners who don't speak English, but a viable audience full of influencers that are a part of American culture,"" she said. Latinos are the fastest growing and largest minority group in the country, 50 million strong, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. And, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, that number is only going to grow -- a projected 133 million by 2050. Plus, Hispanics have $1.2 trillion in purchasing power, which is growing at a faster rate than every other minority's buying power, according to Nielsen. To top it off, Latinos love going to the movies, in fact more than any other demographic group. In 2012, the number of Hispanic moviegoers increased by 12%, according to Nielsen National Research Group, and they accounted for 25% of all movies seen even while they are 18% of the moviegoing population. ""I can't help but wonder if Robert Rodriguez is trying to give Charlie a chance to re-embrace his identity. I just hope Charlie's not just trying to use his culture to get all eyes on him since Latinos are such a hot commodity right now,"" said Herrera Mulligan. ""Latinos take their heritage and their celebrities very seriously."" Reyes thinks America has embraced a culture where it is easy to be outraged and offended. Charlie Sheen's name change should focus on one thing, he said: American culture is changing and becoming more Latinized. ""There are bigger things to worry about like undocumented families being torn apart, poverty among Latino families, etc. Now that's something to be offended about,"" said Reyes, . ""It seems like Robert is using this film to turn convention on its head. It's kitschy, funny and innovative. We should go with it.""","Charlie Sheen has dropped his stage name to birth name, Carlos Estevez, for upcoming flick .

Apple's promotional copy touts ""iPad, iPod and Mac gifts."" Conspicuously absent is any mention of deals on the new iPhone 4S, which starts at $199 (with two-year wireless-carrier contract) and will probably not be discounted. In typically cryptic fashion, the company isn't offering specifics on its seasonal markdowns. But the blog 9to5Mac published what it claims are some leaked details: Modest discounts of $101 on Macs, $41-$61 on iPads (depending on storage capacity) and $21-$41 on iPods. Those would be in line with the Black Friday deals Apple offered last year, although the company only marked its iPads down by $41. 9to5Mac also says some accessories, such as iPad covers, will be discounted Friday. There was no mention of any deals on iPhones. An Apple spokesman declined to comment Wednesday on the report or on potential discounts. Even at a briefly discounted price of $458, the cheapest iPad has new competition this holiday season from smaller, less expensive tablets like Amazon's Kindle Fire ($199) and Barnes & Noble's Nook Tablet ($249). BlackBerry also has slashed the price of its 7-inch PlayBook tablet from $499 to about $200, depending on the retailer. Some observers also had expected Black Friday to mark the debut of Apple's huge new retail store inside New York City's iconic Grand Central Station.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Six people have died in Cyclone Hudhud on Sunday, Indian authorities said. The storm, which made landfall on India's eastern coast, has also uprooted trees and utility poles. When the storm blew ashore, the coast was nearly emptied out. More than 200,000 people were evacuated a day before, officials said. India's science and technology minister, Jitendra Singh, described the cyclone as ""very severe."" Hudhud's sustained winds of 205 kilometers per hour (127 miles per hour) made it a category 3 storm at landfall, CNN meteorologist Derrick Van Dam. Gusts rose to 250 kmh (155 mph).

"London (CNN) -- Harrowing new details have emerged from the last moments of Air France Flight 447 which crashed into the Atlantic in June 2009, killing all 228 passengers and crew. New extracts from the cockpit voice recorder reveal that three seconds before impact, one of the crew exclaimed: ""Damn it, we're going to crash, this can't be true!"" Data from the flight recorders that were recovered after nearly two years on the sea bed previously revealed clues about why the plane crashed on its way to France from Brazil. France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis, the BEA, has said the crisis began after problems arose with the Airbus A330's devices that measure its speed, and disconnection of the autopilot. It also said the recorders revealed that the pilots failed to discuss repeated stall warnings. But in a new book called ""Erreurs de Pilotage"" (Pilot Error) by aeronautics expert Jean Pierre Otelli, fresh material from the last two minutes of the flight as captured by the cockpit voice recorder reveals the panic-stricken conversations of the confused pilots. The plane plunged 38,000 feet in just three minutes and 30 seconds but the recording -- as reported in the book -- illustrates that the crew didn't understand why the plane was not responding. In one extract, a co-pilot says: ""Climb, climb, climb."" But his colleague answers: ""But I've been pulling back on the stick for a while now."" In a computer-generated voice, the plane's warning system keeps repeating the word ""Stall!"" The captain warns: ""Watch out, you are pulling up."" A co-pilot replies: ""Am I pulling up?"" The BEA has strongly condemned the disclosure of the transcript, which it says is a violation of European regulations and shows a lack of respect for the late crew members. ""Any attempt at interpretation at this stage is partial and, as a result, can only fan the flames of the controversies of the last few months, which is harmful to all concerned,"" it said in a statement. Air France has also reacted to what it calls ""sensationalized and unverifiable information,"" which it says ""impairs the memory of the crew and passengers who lost their lives."" CNN's aviation correspondent Richard Quest says the material gives a ""dramatic insight into what was happening"" but adds that it doesn't add anything new to the ongoing investigation. He also says the inquiry poses questions about how difficult modern airliners are to fly in extreme situations. The Air France statement says further work is necessary on what it calls the ""delicate issue of human-machine interface."" The BEA has already issued 10 new safety recommendations, including ensuring extra training for pilots on manual handling of a high-altitude stall, and says new safety recommendations will be issued in the final report on the accident, due to be published in June next year.","The data comes from flight recorders that lay on the sea bed for nearly two years .

"(CNN) -- When former death row inmate John Thompson left a Louisiana prison in 2003 he was one of the lucky ones. He had the support of his family and the lawyers who had worked for more than a decade to prove his innocence in the 1984 shooting death of a hotel executive from a prominent New Orleans family. Within six months of his release, he was married and holding down a steady job. By 2005, he had a brand new home, a car and a dog. He and his wife were running their own sandwich shop in a hotel in downtown New Orleans. ""I was almost getting to feel the American dream,"" said Thompson, who spent 18 years in prison, 14 of them on Louisiana's death row. Then, Hurricane Katrina hit and wiped out his home, his business and the life he'd been struggling to build after nearly two decades locked up. He looked around and realized he was not alone in his struggle to ease back into society. He also wondered where the resources were for people like him who didn't know how to use email, find a doctor or apply for a driver's license and social security card to apply for jobs. ""Men come home and the system has nothing in place to help them put their lives back together,"" he said. ""They need to be reprogrammed because the survival tactics they learned in prison don't work in the outside world."" To help them Thompson started Resurrection After Exoneration, an education and outreach program that helps exonerated and formerly incarcerated inmates rebuild their lives. Again, he says he was lucky because he knew people who could help him write grant applications and navigate the waters of the non-profit world. But it takes more than good fortune and connections to make a go of it after spending nearly two decades in prison, said Michael Banks, one of Thompson's appellate lawyers. ""He's proven himself to be resilient, resourceful and compassionate in ways that are unimaginable given his situation,"" said Banks, who helped Thompson win his freedom. Banks and his colleague Gordon Cooney helped reverse Thompson's capital murder conviction based on evidence that the Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office concealed blood evidence that would have cast doubt on its case. District Attorney Harry Connick Sr., father of the entertainer on TV's ""American Idol,"" reportedly defended his team at the time. ""We follow the rules,"" Connick reportedly told The Associated Press. ""We have an ongoing and continuing obligation to turn over exculpatory evidence and we do."" In a retrial, jurors acquitted Thompson of all charges. ""We felt good about the retrial, the evidence suggested we were going to win,"" Banks said. ""We were worried about what happens next, after he walks out of prison after 18 years. ""There's not a lot of vocational training on death row; the only thing you're trained for is to learn to die."" Thompson's lawyers tried to convince him to go to a residential counseling program in California. But he insisted on staying in New Orleans to be close to his mother and sons, who were four and six when they saw police take him away in handcuffs in 1985. The first place Thompson visited when he left prison was his old neighborhood, where he received a hero's welcome complete with Mardi Gras beads, Banks recalled. However, over a seafood dinner at Pascal Manale -- his first as a free man -- he made it clear that he did not want to return to his previous life, Banks said. ""He knew from the minute he got out, 'I don't want to go back to this old world because this will eat me alive,'"" Banks said. ""He was a 10th grade dropout with no money, no ATM card, he'd never used a cellphone or a computer. The temptation of street crime, drugs and poverty seemed overwhelming. But to his credit he had the emotional intelligence and strength to pursue a different path."" Still, it's been a bumpy road. Thompson won $14 million in damages after suing the Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office for violating his federal civil rights by hiding blood tests that would have proven his innocence. The state appealed and the case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned the judgment in a sharply divided 5-4 decision. Read the Supreme Court opinion . That -- coupled with Katrina -- led Thompson to dedicate his life to fighting for the rights of other exonerees. State laws vary when it comes compensation, but in Louisiana exonerated inmates are eligible for $25,000 per year for each year of wrongful incarceration with a $250,000 cap. But former inmates need more than money, Thompson said. They need guidance and mentoring to help them manage it wisely. Besides, they shouldn't have to wait for compensation to find services essential to their transition and rehabilitation, he said. ""We think states and cities should provide housing and job training. They shouldn't have to wait for compensation to find those services,"" said Thompson. Resurrection After Exoneration offers a variety of services to former inmates. The nondescript building in New Orleans' famous Treme neighborhood provides temporary housing for four people while helping them develop a five-year plan, Thompson said. The first stage involves a lengthy evaluation to get to know the former inmate and to get them back on the grid with a Social Security card, driver's license and doctor's appointments. The organization also helps reconnect them with family or friends who can provide a support system. Next, they start job training by learning computer skills and building resumes. They also go through a long mental health checklist to ensure that the ex-inmate possesses the self-awareness to deal with lingering effects of prison. If needed, counseling referrals are provided. ""If you can't identify and deal with the trauma you fall into depression, and look to drugs and alcohol to escape reality,"" said Thompson. ""That's what keeps these guys from getting over the hump and moving forward."" The organization also teaches participants how to tell their story so they can participate in community outreach efforts. These are key to build empathy and understanding of the needs of inmates returning to society, Thompson said. Like it or not, these people are going to be in the community; it's society's responsibility to help give them a fighting chance, he said. Thompson and other members of RAE visit high schools and law schools to tell their stories. In addition the organization hosts ""Know Your Rights"" classes for practicing lawyers, students and members of the community. Thompson also finds time to work with chapters of the Innocence Project, lobbying for federal guidelines related to compensation and looking for extreme cases of wrongful convictions across the country to cast a spotlight on the national scope of the problem. ""We need to make everyone aware of the importance of accountability and oversight when it comes to prosecutions,"" he said. ""When you send one person away it destroys entire families.""","Ex-death row inmate John Thompson describes re-entering society after 18 years .

"(CNN) -- It was the closest comet near-miss known to astronomers, but everything is alright. Comet Siding Spring shaved past a planet's surface at one third the distance of the Earth to the moon. But it wasn't Earth in the cross hairs -- it was our neighbor Mars. Earth got lucky in more than one way. With a gang of NASA orbiters and rovers on and around Mars, their cameras and instruments got a historic front row seat on the comet that NASA said made the closest recorded pass ever by any planet. The three orbiters are just coming out of hiding. The comet came so close that Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) had to duck and cover on the other side of the planet. Otherwise, Siding Spring's debris of dust and gas flying at 126,000 miles per hour just 87,000 miles above Mars' surface could have blasted them like a shotgun. They're all OK, NASA said in a statement. It will take a few days for them to transfer pictures and data to Earth. Siding Spring has moved on.

"(CNN) -- More than a quarter-million American women served honorably in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. These brave women sacrificed much to keep us safe. Now that they are home, or soon to be home, our country has a solemn obligation to help them transition back to civilian life. Yet there is mounting evidence that America is not fulfilling this obligation. Based on data gathered by the Veterans Affairs and Defense departments, a recent report by Disabled American Veterans finds it clear that our country isn't fully meeting the unique physical, emotional and employment needs of women who served in uniform. Although they served in equal capacities in combat environments, when they return home they receive less support than their male counterparts from government programs primarily designed for men. Today, nearly one in five women who are veterans have delayed or gone without necessary health care in the past year. One in 11 is unemployed. Former servicewomen experience homelessness at between two to four times the rate of their civilian counterparts. It's unacceptable that the women who honorably served our countryâ€”our mothers, spouses, sisters and daughtersâ€”are at risk. The DAV report finds that the federal, state and community programs to support women making the transition out of military service have serious gaps that put some of them in jeopardy. Consider medical care. Today, one-third of the Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers lack a staff gynecologist and 18% of VA clinics have yet to hire at least one doctor specializing in women's health. Mental health services for women are severely lacking. Twenty percent of female patients in the VA health system have been diagnosed with a condition resulting from military sexual trauma, which can have devastating, long-term consequences. Nonetheless, one in three VA health centers does not have enough sexual trauma specialists on staff. Sadly, we are not doing much better when it comes to helping women gain post-military employment. Former servicewomen are highly skilled, with unique life experiences that give them valuable leadership qualities and the know-how to operate effectively in high-stress situations. Yet the unemployment rate for female veterans has steadily climbed for most of the past decade, and is now higher than for male veterans. What's more, two-thirds of women report that the career service help offered by federal agencies has been sub-par. These problems could soon get worse. The military has started on a major drawdown of personnel. As a result, more than 200,000 servicewomen are expected to rejoin the civilian workforce in the next five years. Now is the time for action. In our report, ""Women Veterans: The Long Journey Home,"" DAV outlines 27 key policy and program recommendations that Congress, the administration, VA and the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Housing and Urban Development can take to strengthen the safety net for female veterans. For starters, veterans' health centers must meet their obligation to provide specialists in women's health. At a minimum, every VA medical center must hire a gynecologist. And efforts to treat and help stamp out sexual assault within the military need to be expanded. Officials must intensify their efforts to change any remnants of a culture that comes at the expense of women's dignity and safety. To help combat unemployment among female veterans, the Department of Defense must take a hard look at the primary program designed to help veterans go into the civilian labor force: the Transition Assistance Program. The department does not collect data on participation, satisfaction, and outcomes by gender and race. Simply put, the Department of Defense cannot tell us if the Transition Assistance Program actually helps female veterans find jobs. Also, the VA and Defense Department need to develop career guidance programs specially designed for women. Finally, as the VA and Defense work to strengthen services to servicewomen, these agencies need to invest in improved child care options. Inadequate child care is proving to be a major obstacle for many women transitioning home. For example, many are unable to take part in specialized mental health services, such as post-traumatic stress disorder support groups, because child care is unavailable. Thousands of women answered the call of duty and put themselves at risk to preserve our nation's security. They served this country faithfully. Serving them with greater respect, consideration and care must become a national priority.","A quarter-million U.S. women served in Iraq, Afghanistan and are returning to civilian life .

"(CNN)  -- Barbara A. Mosgrave of Annandale, Virginia, doesn't remember the first time it happened. It's still a blur. But she thinks the episodes began about 50 years ago. At least that's when she remembers someone telling her she was talking gibberish. ""My friends would look at me and say 'What are you talking about?' At 71, Mosgrave knows to expect the unexpected. Since she was a teen she has suffered from serious migraines. ""The kind that cause you to go into a dark room, and shut the door; the pain is that bad,"" she says. But she knew how to control them, and why they were happening. Yet, when it came to her speech, that was different. ""I had no idea that I was babbling,"" she admits. Yet when people began telling her at times she didn't make any sense, she started to wonder; why were her words and phrases coming out all wrong? At first, Mosgrave thought she might be having mini-strokes, but when she went to numerous neurologists they all told her the same thing: She was suffering from a form of headache classified as a complex migraine. Do you live with complex migraines? Share your advice . ""What makes a complex migraine different from the common migraine is that neurologic event outlasts the headache itself,"" says Dr. Marc Schlosberg, a neurologist at Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C., and Mosgrave's physician. According to the National Headache Foundation, 23 million Americans suffer from some form of unusual migraines that could be termed complex. These headaches are more common in women and can occur at any age. Although there are different forms of complex migraines, all occur when blood vessels over dilate, when there's a decrease of blood flowing to the brain, or when the trigeminal nerve, found in the brain and responsible for sensation in the face, becomes irritated. ""It can affect virtually any part of the brain,"" notes Schlosberg. ""It's a complicated chemical reaction we call ""spreading depression."" Part of the brain hyper-polarizes. That part of the brain doesn't receive as much blood supply, because the brain isn't signaling correctly."" Symptoms from these migraines can range from coldness in hands and feet, to dull aches, to a loss of sensation or paralysis, even weakness and nausea. In Mosgrave's case, as well as in the case of reporter Serene Branson who began talking gibberish during a live shot after the Grammys, the ability to speak was affected. ""Migraines that are associated with this type of speech deficit can be understood in the same way that strokes can be understood,"" explains Schlosberg. ""Different types of language problems can occur as different parts of the brain are affected."" ""In the case of the reporter at the Grammys, the type of speech problem she had is what we called Wernicke's aphasia,"" continues Schlosberg. ""Her speech was fluent, but the words that were coming out were nonsensical."" And complicated migraines can go hand in hand with a number of other serious conditions, including depression, strokes, even heart abnormalities. And that worries Mosgrave. ""If you know anything about migraines, as I do, ""says Mosgrave, "" you know there's a connection to a lot of different problems. How can you not think about those?"" Although migraines themselves can be treated with medication, the drugs aren't always foolproof. Even if medications can cut down on the episodes and in some cases, the pain, complex migraines, can pop up at any time, no matter what drugs a patient is on. Mosgrave says she never knows when an episode will happen. Most of the time she's alone, with just her cat, Psyche, but even her feline friend, ""cocks her head to the side as if I'm just making sounds,"" Mosgrave chuckles. ""They don't seem to happen a lot,"" she believes. ""Maybe two or three times a year. When I think they are happening, I just lie down and try to let them pass."" Schlosberg says, in Mosgrave's case her nonsensical words aren't confined to just her speech. Over the years, Schlosberg has received e-mails from Mosgrave, filled with words that make no sense. He says that's pretty rare. Although Mosgrave says she's learned how to live with these headaches, there's always that worry that her complex migraines may be precursors to something more dangerous. She lost her partner almost 30 years ago to a stroke. He, too, suffered from migraines . ""It's scary"" says Mosgrave with a sigh. ""But you have to live with it, the same as you live with a lot of things in this world.""","National Headache Foundation says 23 million Americans suffer from unusual migraines .

"(CNN) -- When you hear ""trick or treat"" this year, think ""nudge."" From economists who study how we actually behave, as opposed to how we're supposed to behave, ""nudge"" is shorthand for the growing body of research showing how small design changes in supermarkets, schools, offices and homes can lead to meaningful behavior changes. Help can't arrive soon enough. With Halloween generating $2.5 billion in candy sales, candy dishes are filling up fast. Confronted by thousands of new calorie missiles staring at us from our desks and break rooms, we usually try two ways to manage risk. First, we hope once again to exert self-control and willpower, believing that the hyper-rational part of our mind can win out over the weaker devil within us that really wants that miniature chocolate bar to fill the midafternoon lull. Dan Ariely and Daniel Kahneman are economists whose work shows this approach is a loser. We are, in Ariely's words, ""predictably irrational."" Absent a nudge, what we are supposed to do and what we really do are two different things. Which brings us to the second option: Someone attempts to pass a new rule banning candy, birthday cakes and cookies. From babies to CEOs, no one likes to have choices taken away. Just ask the American Heart Association, which has found itself on the losing side of the ""bake sale battles."" Nudges represent a third way forward, where we change the conditions in which we live, work and play. As a result of these design changes, we make different and healthier choices -- unconsciously, in most cases. Nudge solutions acknowledge our frailty: that we aren't likely to make the smart choice on our own. Yet these innovations avoid the policy and political fights that come with Bloomberg-style soda bans. 5 scary good healthy Halloween treats . In a new book, ""Slim by Design: Mindless Eating Solutions for Everyday Life,"" Brian Wansink, director of Cornell's Food and Brand Lab, lays out all kinds of practical nudge solutions. ""Becoming slim by design works better than trying to become slim by willpower,"" Wansink writes. ""It's easier to change your eating environment than to change your mind."" Let's start with that office candy dish, an armory for Halloween treats. ""The most dangerous candy dish is one that is close, clear and chocolaty,"" according to Wansink's hidden-camera monitoring of office workers. Here's where design matters. When the candy dish is within easy reach, just beyond the keyboard, workers eat an average of nine pieces of candy per day. Putting the candy dish in a desk drawer cuts consumption to an average of three pieces per day. Wansink saw similar reductions with the candy dish placed on a table top at least 6 feet away. While nudge solutions can help us manage our personal candy battles, the real impact occurs when school cafeterias and other large institutions adopt the practices. Without removing any junk food or banning any items, Wansink and his colleagues have tested nudge solutions in real school lunchroom settings. Fruit consumption more than doubled. More kids picked white milk over sugary drinks. Simply changing the names of some of the items and switching the order of menu options on the lunch line led to healthier choices. They managed all this without any fights over what kind of food would be available. Chocolate milk, which contains more sugar, is a sore point for some nutrition directors. Wansink reports that when schools ban chocolate milk, fewer kids drank milk at all. More of them took white milk but threw it away. And some kids stopped eating lunch, due to the hassle. ""When we make chocolate milk less convenient, even simply putting white milk in the front of the cooler and chocolate in back, sales increase by 30 to 40 percent. No complaints. No front-page stories creating movie-ready bad guys out of well-meaning local dietitians."" All this promising news can be hard for traditional advocacy leaders wedded to nutrition strategies that attempt to hammer a rational food orthodoxy into our collective consciousness. But challenging the status quo is a good thing. The 2009 book, ""Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness,"" by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, makes the case why nonprofit organizations, foundations and government agencies should replace stale program strategies with more promising nudge innovations. The only certainty is that willpower and prohibition have not worked so far, and there's no reason to believe we will become predictably rational. So let the nudging begin.

"Washington (CNN) -- 'Tis the season to be wary when it comes to buying toys for children this holiday. Toxic and dangerous toys are right now sitting on store shelves, and a public interest group is warning consumers to beware when purchasing toys for toddlers because of possible safety hazards. The U.S. Public Interest Research Group released its 27th annual Trouble in Toyland survey Tuesday, and the progress report concluded what it has noted in previous years: toy hazards come in a variety of shapes and forms. Children can be injured from small parts that pose choking risks, strangled by cords on pull toys, lacerated by sharp edges, and endangered by exposure to toxic chemicals. Tents recalled for suffocation risk . Over the years, the organization said, its reports have led to more than 150 recalls and other regulatory actions. This year's list ""includes a potentially dangerous magnet toy, a bowling game that is a choking hazard and a key chain rattle that may be harmful to little ears,"" it said. Researchers visited national toy stores, malls and dollar stores in September, October and November this year to look for potential toxic, choking, strangulation and noise hazards. ""We should be able to trust that the toys we buy are safe. However, until that's the case, parents need to watch out for common hazards when shopping for toys,"" said Nasima Hossain, public health advocate for Public Interest Research Group, in a release detailing the report. Folding bicycles recalled . The Toy Industry Association, which represents more than 500 manufacturers in the United States, said, ""Safety is our top priority all year,"" and a spokesman called the group's survey ""another of its needlessly frightening reports."" ""Its headlines cry for caution but the fine print clarifies that most of the products on their list actually comply with the strict toy safety standards that are already in place in the U.S.,"" said Stacy Leistner, vice president of communications for the association. ""Our companies are manufacturing to current regulations."" Leistner said that with some 3 billion toys sold in the United States every year, ""we have a good track record for our companies making safe products."" Among the survey's findings: . -- Lead exposure from toys remains a serious risk to the brains of young children and ""can cause permanent mental and developmental impairments."" -- Magnet toys pose problems, especially if the magnets are swallowed. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has estimated there were 1,700 emergency room cases nationwide between 2009 and 2011 involving the ingestion of high-power magnets, nearly three-quarters of them in children between 4 and 12. Magnetic Buckeyballs discontinued . -- Two toys -- a car driving wheel on a console and a toy guitar -- exceed the recommended limit for continuous exposure to noise above 65 decibels. Researchers say one in five U.S. children will have some degree of hearing loss by the time they reach the age of 12. -- Several toys contain small parts having what the organization says is improper labeling and ""might be mistakenly purchased for children under 3."" Choking on small toy parts such as marbles and balloons has resulted in hundreds of deaths over the past two decades. Consumers are urged to examine toys carefully for potential dangers before making a purchase. The U.S. Public Interest Research Group recommends the Consumer Product Safety Commission review its definition of ""small part"" or ""small toy"" to include parts and toys that are larger than the current standard but have been shown to pose a choking hazard. It also calls for ""vigorous"" enforcement of lead limits in toys.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An elite U.S. special forces team rescued an American doctor who had been abducted in Afghanistan, but lost one of their own members in the mission, officials said. Dr. Dilip Joseph was freed 11 hours after his captors released two other kidnapped staffers of his nonprofit agency, Morning Star Development, the organization said Sunday. Hours later, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced that ""a U.S. service member was killed in the operation."" A U.S. official said the man who was shot dead belonged to the Navy's Special Warfare Development Group, more commonly known as SEAL Team Six. The elite unit is the same one that took part in the raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, but the official didn't know if the fallen service member was involved in that operation. While he did not delve into detail, Panetta said, ""the special operators who conducted this raid knew they were putting their lives on the line to free a fellow American from the enemy's grip."" The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said Joseph was believed to be in imminent danger of injury or death when the rescue mission was launched. ""He gave his life for his fellow Americans, and he and his teammates remind us once more of the selfless service that allows our nation to stay strong, safe and free,"" President Barack Obama said of the slain U.S. service member, who was not immediately identified. There were conflicting reports about who was behind the kidnappings. ISAF said it was Taliban insurgents, while two local Afghan officials told CNN it was smugglers. The kidnapping of Joseph and the two other Morning Star staff members occurred around 3:30 p.m. Wednesday (6 a.m. ET), as the three men were returning from a rural medical clinic in eastern Kabul province. ""They were stopped and captured while driving, by a group of armed men,"" according to the agency, which sponsors community and economic initiatives in Afghanistan. ""They were eventually taken to a mountainous area about 50 miles from the Pakistan border."" Tribal leader Malik Samad and district chief Muhammad Haqbeen told CNN that Joseph and an Afghan doctor were abducted near the village of Jegdalek in the Sarobi district, just outside Kabul. Morning Star said negotiations began ""almost immediately"" between the captors, the hostages and the agency's crisis management team in Kabul and Colorado Springs, Colorado. In addition to U.S. and Afghan authorities, the agency thanked ""Afghan residents (including) elders and local leaders who made visits and appeals to the captors advocating for the release of the hostages."" The ""on-again, off-again"" negotiations lasted three days into Saturday night, when two of the three were released. Morning Star did not release the identities of the two men, citing safety concerns ""because they live and work in the general region."" The group said one of them belonged to its medical staff and the other was part of the organization's support staff. The two men got out of the area and eventually were taken to a police station, at which time Morning Star and their families learned they'd been released. The Afghan doctor's family paid $12,000 to the smugglers, who later released him, Haqbeen and Samad said. For its part, Morning Star stated ""categorically that we paid no ransom, money or other consideration"" to anyone in securing any of its staffers' release. Sometime Saturday night, military forces rescued Joseph in a mission ordered by Gen. John Allen, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Samad and Haqbeen, the two Afghan officials, said the operation took place in Laghman province. ""Today's mission exemplifies our unwavering commitment to defeating the Taliban,"" Allen said in a statement. ""I'm proud of the American and Afghan forces that planned, rehearsed and successfully conducted this operation. Thanks to them, Dr. Joseph will soon be rejoining his family and loved ones."" Joseph has worked with Morning Star for three years. He serves as its medical adviser, and travels frequently to Afghanistan, the agency said. The doctor appeared to be in ""good condition and uninjured"" at Bagram Airfield after his abduction.

"(CNN) -- The pitch reads: ""Would you know if an odorless, colorless and tasteless rape drug were put in your drink? What if your cup, straw or glass changed color to warn you?"" The pitch comes from a group of people who've put their minds together to work toward developing a cup and straw that will change color in the presence of date-rape drugs. When substances like GHB, ketamine and Rohypnol touch the surface of the drinkware, they will turn into the designated color used to detect the drug, alerting you to its presence. In a video posted to YouTube to promote a funding campaign, DrinkSavvy Inc. founder Mike Abramson said the idea came from a bad experience where he was once ""roofied"" -- referring to Rohypnol, a sedative -- while out drinking with friends. ""Within the past three years, three of my very close friends, and myself, have been the unwitting victims of being drugged."" He added, ""DrinkSavvy's ultimate goal is to use the success of this campaign to convince bars, clubs and colleges to make DrinkSavvy the new safety standard and eventually make drug-facilitated sexual assault a crime of the past."" Abramson says of his experience: He was at a club in Boston celebrating a friend's birthday and went to get a drink and then ""felt like I had 15 drinks. Luckily, friends were able to get me home safely."" Afterward, he went to John McDonald, professor of chemistry at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where Abramson had attended college, with his idea to create a detection system. After about two years of research, a prototype was launched in the funding campaign. The Boston-based company started a campaign on Indiegogo in November 2012 with hopes to raise $50,000. The monthlong campaign resulted in more than 2,500 contributors surpassing their $50,000 goal and getting the company one step closer to making the product a reality. And Abramson is a finalist in the MassChallenge, an annual $1 million startup competition and accelerator program that helps entrepreneurs get access to mentors, marketing and other resources. Over the next few months, drink straws and, possibly, cups that can detect the anesthetic GHB will be sent out to the people who financially supported the campaign to get feedback. Abramson says the company also has done tests to detect Rohypnol and the anesthetic ketamine, and expects to roll out cups and straws that will detect all three drugs in early to mid-2014. At that point the products will also be available on the company's website. Watch a prototype demonstration on YouTube . One of the company's main goals is to get its products in bars and in the hands of college students. Abramson says they are in discussion with several colleges to make this new technology part of their rape-prevention initiatives. He said he is well aware that his company's products won't solve all the sexual assault problems, telling CNN ""this is not 100% fool-proof, it's not a cure-all."" According to a 2007 study for the National Institute of Justice, only a small fraction (2.4%) of female undergraduate students who were sexually assaulted were certain or suspected they were incapacitated after having been given a drug without her knowledge. The Center for Women and Families notes that alcohol is the chief concern: ""For rape which takes place on campuses, alcohol is being used in 90% of cases."" A pilot program is set to take place at a bar in Boston in either December or January. As for cost, DrinkSavvy says prices will be competitive with what the bars already pay for cups and straws.","Boston-based company devises cups and straws that can detect date-rape drugs .

"(CNN) -- Edith Windsor, who filed the original case that could upend the Defense of Marriage Act, says just getting the case to this point is a kind of victory. ""We've made a huge step forward and a huge difference in how people look at us,"" she said. ""And so, it'll happen. Another year if not now."" It was the death of Windsor's life partner, Thea Clara Spyer, that led to the case. Theirs was not a fleeting romance -- the women were together 42 years sharing ups and downs, laughs and tears. They also shared what they'd earned together, including from Windsor's job as a programmer with IBM and Spyer's work as a psychologist. 5 things we learned from day one of oral arguments . ""We were mildly affluent and extremely happy,"" Windsor said. ""We were like most couples."" But even after they married in 2007 in Toronto, some 40 years into their courtship, the two women were not ""like most couples"" in the eyes of the state of New York, where they lived, nor in the eyes of the U.S. government, which under the Defense of Marriage Act mandates that a spouse, as legally defined, must be a person of the opposite sex. This fact hit Windsor hard in 2009, while in a hospital after suffering a heart attack a month after Spyer's death. As she recovered and mourned, Windsor realized she faced a hefty bill for inheritance taxes -- $363,053 more than was warranted, she later claimed in court -- because Spyer was, in legal terms, little more than a friend. ""It was incredible indignation,"" Windsor recalled feeling. ""Just the numbers were so cruel."" This anger gave way to action. Why, she and her lawyers argued, should her relationship with Spyer be any different when it came to rights, taxes and more than a heterosexual couple? Why should Windsor have to pay, literally, for losing her soulmate -- even though, by 2009, New York courts had recognized that ""foreign same-sex marriages"" should be recognized in the state as valid? In October, Windsor got an answer in the form of a ruling opinion from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That court found, in her favor, that the Defense of Marriage Act violates the Constitution's equal protection clause and thus she shouldn't have had to pay an inheritance tax after her partner's death. This follows a similar ruling, in May, from another federal appeals court in Boston. Federal appeals court strikes down Defense of Marriage Act . Neither opinion settles the matter for good. That is expected to happen when the Supreme Court will weigh the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act through the prism of Windsor and Spyer's story. It is one of two cases related to same-sex marriage that the high court is considering. The other addresses California's Proposition 8. The court is expected to rule on both cases by mid-June. Even with those cases pending, Windsor said last fall -- when the lower court decided in her favor, three years after Spyer's death -- that she felt she could finally breathe and celebrate. It was a day she relished, and one she didn't entirely expect after all her heartache. ""What I'm feeling is elated,"" Windsor said. ""Did I ever think it could come to be, altogether? ... Not a chance in hell."" By the numbers: Same-sex marriage . Instant chemistry in Greenwich Village . Born in Philadelphia in 1929, on the eve of the Great Depression, Windsor graduated from Temple University and earned a master's degree, in 1957, from New York University, according to a fall 2011 story in the latter school's alumni magazine. She had come to New York hoping for a fresh start after a brief marriage, according to the report. And professionally, she found it -- working for NYU's math department and soon entering data into its UNIVAC, one of a few dozen of the huge commercial computers then in operation. Her knack for programming eventually helped her land a job, and to excel, at IBM. But something was missing in her life, personally. Or, as Windsor put it more succinctly, ""I suddenly couldn't take it anymore."" In the documentary ""Edie and Thea: A Very Long Engagement,"" she recalled pleading with an old friend to take her ""where the lesbians go."" And so Windsor spent one Friday night at Portofino, a restaurant in New York's Greenwich Village. ""Somebody brought Thea over and introduced her. And we ended up dancing,"" she recalled. ""And we immediately just fit,"" added Spyer, on the documentary. Timeline: Same-sex marriage . After reuniting two years later, according to their New York Times' wedding announcement, their connection proved deep and lasting. In 1967, Spyer proposed marriage with a round diamond pin. A year later, they purchased a house together in Southampton, according to the NYU Alumni Magazine story. Yet while the gay rights' movement took off after the 1969 Stonewall Riots, which occurred while Windsor and Spyer were vacationing in Italy, an actual marriage -- a legal union -- seemed out of the question. Marriage, at last, and then heartache . Regardless, their love remained strong. On the documentary, filmed around 2007, Spyer said, ""Each one of us, in fact, looks different from how we looked when we met. But if I look at Edie now, she looks exactly the same to me. Exactly the same."" Windsor had halted her new career as a gay rights activist to help care for her partner, who suffered from multiple sclerosis. And it was after getting a ""bad prognosis (that) I had another year to live and that was it"" that Spyer proposed again. ""And I said yes,"" Windsor recalled. ""She said, 'So do I.' "" Video shows Spyer being pushed through the airport in her wheelchair. It was from that seat -- on May 22, 2007, at Toronto's Sheraton Gateway Hotel -- that she gave her vows to make their marriage official in Canada. ""I, Thea Spyer, choose you, Edith Windsor, to be my lawful, wedded spouse,"" she said. ""For richer and for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part."" Married same-sex couple awaits epic high court appeal . Having happily gone four decades without, Windsor soon realized how much the marriage meant to her. It made her and Spyer's love legitimate and all the more real. ""It's different because somewhere you're a hidden person, and suddenly you're a citizen of the world,"" she said in October of 2012. But what happened as Spyer's condition worsened, and after her death, proved a stark reminder they were not legally united in their own country. And the fact that New York legalized same-sex marriage in 2011 didn't mean that Windsor, for example, would suddenly get back the hundreds of thousands of dollars in inheritance tax that she'd given to the government. That could happen, however, if the Supreme Court upholds the appeals court ruling. That is Windsor's hope, as is that whether a committed couple is heterosexual or homosexual becomes irrelevant within the next decade. In the meantime, Windsor said she's proud to fight for something bigger than herself and the legitimacy of her union with Spyer. She hopes, through her struggle, to help make it so gay teenagers can ""fall in love knowing there's a future,"" that children of gay couples won't feel the need to explain their families, and that homophobia becomes a thing of the past. ""I feel like I'm representing them."" Couple fights for right to marry .","Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer met in New York and were together more than 40 years .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- North Korea's sanction-hit regime has long been accused of drug trafficking as a source of hard currency, but a new report claims drug producers are finding a ready market closer to home and that as many as two-thirds of North Koreans have used methamphetamines. According to a report in the Spring 2013 edition of the journal North Korean Review, stricter China border controls have forced methamphetamine producers in the north to seek a local market for ""ice"" (known locally as ""bingdu""). The report's co-author, Professor Kim Seok Hyang, of South Korea's Ewha Woman's University, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that interviews with North Korean defectors suggested that the country is in the grip of an ""ice"" plague. ""Some informants are saying almost every adult in North Korea around the China-North Korea border are using methamphetamine,"" she said, adding that the drug was often used as a palliative in place of hard-to-obtain prescription medicine. ""Actually, the hospital medical system (has) stopped for such a long time, so they need something to cure their pain ... physical pain,"" she said. ""But once they get addicted to methamphetamine, there's no way for them to get out of it."" The North Korean regime releases no official figures on drug addiction and Professor Kim said the scale of the problem could not be statistically verified. ""But almost everybody in my interview is saying so, especially those who left North Korea after 2009,"" she told the ABC. She said that interviewees told her the drug could be ordered casually and easily in restaurants, and that it had become difficult to control since it had become the drug of choice of high-ranking officials and the police. While readily available, however, informants told her it was still expensive and did not indicate that North Korea had a greater level of disposable income for recreational drug use. ""Using methamphetamine does not mean they have enough money to dispose (of),"" Professor Kim said. ""They had to get it with all the money they have."" North Korea has been widely rumored to manufacture high-grade methamphetamine as a state policy for generating hard cash. Estimates on how much North Korea generates through illegal activities such as arms trades, drug sales and counterfeiting are speculative, but reports say Pyongyang's shadowy ""Room 39"" directs illicit trade that generates millions for the nation's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.","Report claims North Korean drug producers are finding a ready market closer to home .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Nancy Writebol's family says it was making funeral plans for her last week as she lay stricken with Ebola in Liberia amid the disease's deadliest recorded outbreak. After an experimental serum and a plane flight, she's now the second human Ebola patient on U.S. soil, and her relatives think she has a fighting chance. A medical plane on Tuesday flew Writebol from Liberia to Atlanta, where she was rushed to the same hospital where an American missionary colleague arrived days earlier. Like her, he was sickened by the deadly hemorrhagic disease while on a team caring for Ebola patients in Monrovia. Writebol was wheeled into Emory University Hospital early Tuesday afternoon on a gurney, wearing a white, full-body protective suit and escorted by two people wearing similar gear. There, she joins her fellow missionary Dr. Kent Brantly, who became the first Ebola patient ever in the United States on Saturday, for treatment in a special isolation unit. It is one of four of its kind in the United States designed to optimize care for those with highly infectious diseases. ""Nancy is still very weak"" but has shown signs of improvement, said Bruce Johnson, president of Christian mission group SIM USA, with which Writebol is affiliated. Writebol's arrival contrasted with that of Brantly, who wore a similar suit but walked into the hospital Saturday with someone's assistance. Writebol, of North Carolina, and Brantly, of Texas and Indiana, were on a joint Samaritan's Purse-SIM team caring for Ebola patients last month when they became sick in Liberia. That is one of four West African nations hit by an outbreak that the World Health Organization believes has sickened 1,603 people and killed 887 of them. Writebol's two sons expect to communicate with her soon, Johnson said. The family was considering funeral arrangements for her just last week, days after she became sick, David Writebol said through Johnson. ""Yet we kept our faith, (and) now we have real reason to be hopeful,"" David Writebol said in a statement read by Johnson. Though there is no proven treatment or vaccine for Ebola, Brantly and Writebol were recently given an experimental, U.S.-manufactured drug in Liberia while they were awaiting evacuation to the United States. Both have since shown significant improvement, sources said on condition of anonymity. What the inside of the evacuation plane looks like . The gruesome disease that can torment victims with profuse vomiting, uncontrollable bleeding and organ failure is ravaging West Africa. The outbreak started this year in Guinea but also has affected Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. The flight and the experimental serum . Though Writebol was weak, she had yogurt before her flight early Saturday from Liberia to the United States, Johnson said. She was taken to the plane by stretcher, but she stood up and entered the plane with assistance, he said. The experimental drug ZMapp, which Brantly and Writebol received despite the medication never being subjected to clinical trials, is getting a lot of attention. Just last Thursday, Brantly's condition in Liberia had deteriorated so badly that he called his wife to say goodbye. But three vials of ZMapp stored at subzero temperatures were flown into Liberia. Brantly and Writebol took the drug, and their conditions improved before they evacuated to the United States. 9 questions about this new Ebola drug . The medicine is thought to work by preventing the virus from entering and infecting new cells. It's a three-mouse monoclonal antibody -- meaning mice were exposed to fragments of the Ebola virus, and the antibodies generated within the mice's blood were harvested to create the medicine. While Brantly and Writebol's conditions improved after taking the drug, the serum shouldn't be viewed as a miracle cure, internist and gastroenterologist Dr. Jorge Rodriguez said. ""Let's be cautious. We don't even know really if this serum is working,"" Rodriguez said. ""I'm glad now that these patients were brought to a hospital where so many tests can be done, where they can see the response of their body to this serum. We don't know if these patients are naturally getting better, or whether the serum is really doing something."" Many have asked why the two Americans received the experimental drug when so many in West Africa also have the virus. The World Health Organization says it was not involved in the decision to treat Brantly and Writebol. Both patients had to give consent to receive the drug knowing it had never been tested in humans before. The process by which the medication was made available to the American patients may have fallen under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's ""compassionate use"" regulation, which allows access to investigational drugs outside clinical trials. American Ebola patient 'seems to be improving,' CDC chief says . How Ebola spreads . Ebola doesn't spread through the air or water. The disease spreads through contact with infected organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva and urine. Historically, the odds have not been good. Previous Ebola outbreaks have had a fatality rate of 90%, but the current outbreak in West Africa has a rate of about 60%, perhaps because of early treatment. There is no FDA-approved treatment for Ebola. Emory will use ""supportive care"" for its two Ebola patients, unit supervisor Dr. Bruce Ribner said. That means carefully tracking a patient's symptoms, vital signs and organ function and using blood transfusions and dialysis to keep patients stable. The National Institutes of Health plans to begin testing an experimental Ebola vaccine in people as early as September. Tests on primates have been successful. In the 1990s, an Ebola strain tied to monkeys -- Ebola-Reston -- was found in the United States, but no humans got sick from it, according to the CDC. What is the risk of catching Ebola on a plane? Concerns, testing spread outside Africa . A man hospitalized in New York City was in strict isolation Monday and Tuesday, waiting to learn whether he has the disease. The patient became ill after recently traveling to West Africa, New York's Mount Sinai Hospital said. Doctors were trying to confirm the cause of the man's high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. A specimen from the patient was delivered to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta; testing typically is completed within 48 hours, the hospital said Tuesday. But ""odds are this is not Ebola,"" said Dr. Jeremy Boal, chief medical officer of the Mount Sinai Health System. ""It's much more likely that it's a much more common condition."" The patient was stable Monday night into Tuesday and was in ""good spirits,"" the hospital said in a news release Tuesday. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta agrees. About half a dozen people have recently returned from West Africa and gotten tested because of symptoms, but none of those cases has been confirmed as Ebola, Gupta said. Doctors in Saudi Arabia are also taking precautions as they treat a 40-year-old man who recently returned from Sierra Leone. The man was in critical condition Tuesday with symptoms of a viral hemorrhagic fever, the Saudi Health Ministry said. The source of his infection remains unknown, but Ebola cannot be ruled out, the ministry said. What to know about Ebola . Experimental drug likely saved Ebola patients . CNN's Dana Ford, Danielle Dellorto, Jacque Wilson and Caleb Hellerman contributed to this report.","NEW: Nancy Writebol is very weak but has shown signs of improvement .

"(CNN) -- Anxiety disorders cost the United States more than $42 billion a year, nearly one-third of the total ""economic burden"" of mental illness in this country. When I came across this figure recently, I had no doubt that it represented a real and serious problem. I have struggled with anxiety for almost 20 years, and when I look back at all the afternoons I've spent paralyzed by the disorder -- ruminating over things beyond my control, crippled by concerns, waiting out a panic beneath the covers -- I see months upon months of diminished productivity and income. And yet, at the same time, something in me bristled at the effort to articulate the ravages of anxiety in financial terms. Statistics are useful in coaxing policymakers to spend more on psychiatric research, treatment and (one fervently hopes) prevention. But no running of the numbers will ever reflect the truly tragic burden of anxiety, which plays out not in the realm of work but in the realm of relationships. More than anything else, what anxiety costs sufferers is the ability to love. When I was 21, and just out of college, I fell in love with a bright and beautiful young woman named Joanna. At the time I was enduring yet another one of my periods of acute anxiety. I was jittery and unfocused, fearful and obsessed; I couldn't sleep; I couldn't eat; my libido was gone. Meeting Joanna banished these afflictions. Almost overnight, I recovered a sense of confidence, stability, optimism and poise. No therapist or pill had ever done that for me. Love, I concluded, was the best treatment for anxiety known to humankind. Unfortunately, what an anxiety disorder does to love is far more consequential than what love can do to the disorder. Anxiety is a wily, reactive affliction; it often recedes in response to positive life events. But it seldom recedes for long. Like acne or arthritis, anxiety is always lying in wait, ready to flare back up. My anxiety came back shortly after Joanna moved in with me and when it did it quickly consumed our relationship. The main problem was self-obsession. When people ask me what clinical anxiety feels like, I sometimes refer to ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,"" the great memoir by the French magazine editor Jean-Dominique Bauby, who, at 44, suffered a massive stroke leading to ""locked-in syndrome."" Unable to move or speak, Bauby became a prisoner in his own mind. An anxiety sufferer can feel as if he too is imprisoned in his own mind, but with the demonic twist that his mind can think of nothing but itself. Anxious thoughts are radically personal thoughts. Their central concern is what affects you, what threatens you, what you need, you regret, you dread, you fear. Anxiety is a condition of near-total self-absorption, made only worse by the fact that the sufferer typically realizes that he is being self-absorbed and grieves over his sad inability to see past himself. You can see how this state of mind affects relationships by looking at the biographies of well-known anxiety sufferers. An anxious lover tends to toggle between desperate need and strenuous rejection. He or she can never decide whether being in a committed relationship is a source of comfort or humiliation, joy or pain. The most dramatic example I know of this is Franz Kafka, quite possibly the most incompetent lover of all time. Kafka spent five years alternately wooing his unlucky sweetheart and trying to eject her from his life, using all the formidable logic and literary skills he possessed to convince her that he was a ""sick, weak, unsociable, taciturn, gloomy, stiff, almost helpless man"" with whom life would be an utter disaster. Kafka ultimately proved his point, and so did I. Over and over again, I pushed Joanna away and pulled her back, drawing her into an abusive four-step dance. First, I would grow increasingly uncertain. ""Was I truly in love with Joanna?"" I would ask myself. How could I be when we didn't appreciate all the same books, the same music, the same movies? Was it possible that what I called love had been merely infatuation, lust, desire? Second, torn by my doubts, I would grow withdrawn and sullen, even openly hostile. I would ignore Joanna, make nasty little remarks, put her down in front of her friends. Third, Joanna would start to fight back. Neglected and mistreated, she would respond with anger and sadness. Why was I being so cruel? What had she done to deserve this? Fourth, horrified by my behavior, I would try urgently and with great remorse to repair the damage. I'd buy her flowers, send her cute messages during the day, hang on her every word. Then, after a short respite, the dance would begin again. About a year after Joanna and I moved in together, she finally decided that she'd had enough, and broke up with me on a subway platform in Boston. At first I was bereft, but in time I have come to see the dissolution of that relationship as the best thing that ever happened to me, for it made clear that anxiety is not merely a threat to one's mental stability, happiness, or livelihood, it is a threat to one's humanity. If I did nothing to lessen my anxiety, I realized, I would never become any of the things I wanted to become: a good husband, a good father, a good brother, a good friend. How could I become these things when, in my towering distress, I could pay heed to no one's existence or needs but my own? This is the question that first led me to seek out treatment for my anxiety in earnest, and to devote myself to learning how to mitigate the condition, a task to which, more than a decade later, I am still devoted. It also led me to a place where I could try, in good faith, to win Joanna back. This didn't happen immediately, or easily. Joanna and I were apart for nearly three years before our paths crossed again, and at first she was understandably wary of my affections. She knew firsthand the kind of trouble my anxiety caused. ""How do I know you won't freak out again?"" she asked. I answered that I likely would -- I doubt that my anxiety will ever go away completely -- but I promised her that I would never again allow my anxiety to infect my love for her as it once had. Joanna and I were married the next year and have been with each other ever since, and all these years I have worked hard to keep my promise. How could I do otherwise? I know firsthand the cost of failure. It's incalculable. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Smith.","Anxiety disorders cost the United States more than $42 billion a year .

"(CNN) -- As you walk through the Liberdade district of Sao Paulo, you could be forgiven for thinking you are in down-town Tokyo. Bright red torii gates of Shinto shrines line the streets, and myriad Asian restaurants and supermarkets display advertisements in Japanese characters. This is the center of the biggest Japanese immigrant community in the world. Over 1.8 million people of Japanese descent live in Brazil, 600,000 of them concentrated in Liberdade. First settlers arrived in 1908, escaping poverty and unemployment in Japan, and were heading for the coffee plantations of Brazil's south which were in pressing need of laborers after the abolition of slavery. They were housed in former slaves' barracks where they slept on the floor, and suffered from illnesses new to them, like malaria, which they didn't know how to treat. They also had to adapt to a culture vastly different to their own. Read more: Managing Brazil's growing economy . But in spite of the initial hardship, the contribution Japanese immigrants made to Brazilian society has been far-reaching. Rikkyo University professor and author of several studies on Japanese immigration to Latin America Hiroaki Maruyama states that they introduced organized farming to the Amazon, where previously only hunter-gatherer system was practiced. They also started commercial cultivation of pepper, setting Brazil on the road of becoming the world's fourth largest producer of the spice according to The International Pepper Community, an inter-governmental organization of pepper producing countries. Japanese influence was not limited to agriculture - early settlers popularized martial arts, helping create Brazilian jiu jitsu, and even the national drink, caipirinha, is sometimes mixed with Japanese rice wine instead of cachaca, creating a sakerinha. Read more: Brazil's middle-class boom - but are they tempting a bust? In the arts, Japanese Brazilian architect Ruy Ohtake designed some of Sao Paulo's most iconic buildings, and renowned painter Manabu Mabe introduced Japanese zen sensibility to contemporary Brazilian art. Below CNN takes a look at three generations of Japanese immigrants who talk about how their heritage has shaped their lives in South America. ""I feel completely Brazilian"" Kokei Uehara, 85, was nine when his parents sent him to Brazil with his aunt and uncle to escape the looming threat of WW II in Japan. It would be more than 20 years before he would see his mother again and learn that his father died in the war. He said:"" When I boarded the ship that would take me to Brazil, I was desperate. I saw my parents run along the dock and I wanted to go back down to them, but my uncle stopped me. That was the last time I saw my father."" As a child, Mr Uehara worked in the cotton fields during the day, and made an eight kilometer round trip on foot to school in the afternoon. ""I didn't understand a word of Portuguese, and when I did start speaking I had a thick Japanese accent, and I was teased. So I thought, I'll work really hard and be the best "", he said. From Samba to carnival: Brazil's thriving African culture . Kokei Uehara went on to become a world renowned hydraulics engineer and UNESCO representative in Brazil, as well as Professor Emeritus at Sao Paulo University. He also participated in the building of some of the largest hydroelectric dams in Brazil. When it comes to defining his identity, Kokei Uehara he has no qualms:"" I feel completely Brazilian, I was very young when I got here so I adapted to the culture easily."" I couldn't identify with Japan . Lidia Yamashita, 63, is an architect and the vice-president of the Historic Museum of Japanese Immigration in Sao Paulo. She was born in Brazil, and grew up in a household where only Japanese was spoken. Her mother's father was a dentist in Japan who was invited to come to Brazil by the immigrant community as they needed skilled medical practitioners. Her mother's father was a shrine builder in Tokyo who lost most of his possessions in a fire, and decided to come to Brazil in search of a new life. She said:"" Before I went to Japan, I thought of myself as completely Japanese, because my mother doesn't speak Portuguese, and in my home we practiced a very Japanese way of living. ""But when I went to study at the Tokyo Metropolitan University I realized that I actually wasn't Japanese, and couldn't identify myself in their society. I saw that I think in a western manner, and I was very different from my roommates."" An even mix of two cultures . Paula Kiyohara, 27, is a fashion student and a third generation Japanese Brazilian who considers herself an even mix of the two cultures. She says: ""The easy going part of my nature is Brazilian, but my values and attitudes, like respect for ancestors, is Japanese. Lost continent discovered underwater? One of the main differences in cultures is that Japanese people don't like disturbing anyone - If my mother hears me playing loud music in my room she will tell me to turn it down so I don't bother the neighbors, but if it were a Brazilian person they would play it louder so that their neighbor can enjoy too."" Paula's family speaks a mix of Japanese and Portuguese at home, a cultural fusion which has infiltrated their cooking style too. She says:"" I eat Japanese rice with Brazilian beans and meat, and when we have family gatherings we will make sushi with churrasco (Brazilian grilled meat) instead of fish.""

"Ansan, South Korea (CNN) -- Kang Min Kyu, 52, taught ethics. Kang, who was vice principal at Ansan's Danwon High School, was rescued from the sinking Sewol ferry. Just two days after the accident, he was found dead after apparently hanging himself using a belt from a tree in the city of Jindo. In a note, he expressed regret he had survived while so many others had died. On a chilly Monday, around 4:30 a.m., Kang's coffin was led out of a funeral hall in a long, black hearse. It was too early for any sunlight. There were no pallbearers carrying the coffin -- only a quick walking procession of his family members and what appeared to be about a hundred others dressed in black following the car through the parking lot. No one spoke. His family members -- one son, two daughters and his wife dressed in all-black traditional Korean wear followed the hearse. When they reached the end of the parking lot of the funeral home, they got into the car. The whole walk took less than five minutes before the mourners got in and drove in a line of cars headed to the crematorium. Kang's body had been found Friday in one of the small mountains near the Jindo Gymnasium where bereaved families are taking shelter, according to local police. He had gone to Jindo with the school in an effort to support families, said one fellow educator. ""As the one in charge of the safety of the students, he was suffering from guilty feelings,"" another teacher had told Korean media. When some familes directed their anger at him, he became ""brokenhearted."" Over 300 students from the school and their teachers were aboard the ferry. Some are confirmed dead and and hope is dwindling that any more survivors will be found. 174 were rescued. Hundreds remain missing. Police have confirmed the contents of a note, which Kang left behind. He wrote that it was his idea for the field trip and that the deaths of the students were his fault. He said he could not live not knowing where his students are. He also wrote that he wonders whether he could still be their teacher on the other side, in death. Families protest over rescue operation . The note also expressed a request to be cremated and his ashes scattered where the Sewol had sank. In Korean funerals, there are no ceremonies or eulogies -- they are a quiet, private affair. People who wish to say farewell visit a funeral room and pay their respects to the deceased one's family. The family members receive guests for about three days. During this period, several students from the high school came to the funeral home to pay their respects to Kang's family. Dressed in their school uniforms, they bowed to the family. Outside the funeral hall, some of them spoke about Kang. ""He was an ethics teacher,"" said freshman Choi Yoo Jung. ""I wonder if that's why it was hard for him. He was such a good person. He really liked students a lot."" Another student, Kim Hyun Soo, also a freshman, said she felt it was too harsh for Kang to be blamed for what happened on the ferry. ""The vice principal really liked students,"" she said. ""It seems like he was really hard on himself. I don't think anyone should be blaming him."" His death elicited sorry and sympathy across South Korea. Messages of sympathy and grief have been outpouring on social media. ""Teacher Kang Min Kyu, please rest in peace. Praying for the soul of the departed,"" tweeted @minifi_0309. ""We are so sorry..."" tweeted Kim Min Hyuk, a senior at the high school, who tweeted the name of the vice principal along with the names of other dead teachers from the ferry tragedy. Judging from the volume of flowers sent to his funeral room -- from ROTC, his high school classmates, his previous schools where he taught -- it appeared the educator for over 20 years was a well-respected one. The day before the funeral procession, his family declined to be interviewed. The hearse carrying his coffin traveled a few miles east and pulled into Danwon High School, circling the campus for one last time -- signifying Kang's last visit to his school.","Kang Min Kyu, 52, was vice principal at Danwon High School .

"(CNN) -- Crystal R. takes pictures of her neighborhood as part of Witnesses to Hunger. Among Crystal's photos of piles of trash, abandoned lots and barbed wire fences is a striking picture: large advertisements for ""special prices"" of cigarettes promising ""Kool -- be true"" that greet her on her way to shop for food. A recent analysis of federal data by the Population Health Metrics found that as smoking declines at a fast rate in more affluent communities, the rates are staying the same among the poor and working class. More people are smoking in poorer communities. It is easy to blame people in poverty for making bad choices. But it's more complicated than that.  Tobacco companies target these communities to encourage the habit, and the stresses of living in poverty and sometimes hopelessness also cause people to turn to cigarettes. Witness to Hunger works with the real experts -- mothers and caregivers of young children who have gone hungry and live in poverty. Crystal, who chooses not to use her last name, talks openly about the stress of her environment: ""When I go to the supermarket, it's uncomfortable. ... It's embarrassing to pull my Access card out. I feel like the other people in the line are just looking and judging, saying things ..."" As pediatricians at Boston Medical Center, we know to define what is symptom of the disease, such as a cough, and what is the underlying disease to be treated, the pneumonia. We don't just suppress the cough with syrups; we treat the underlying infection with antibiotics. In this case, poverty may be as much the symptom as the disease, given how much the chronic stress of poverty drives unhealthy behaviors. There are underlying factors that must be addressed before tobacco use can be substantially reduced in all communities. First, tobacco companies target low-income neighborhoods with more cigarette advertising: larger signs, and three times as many brand ads. Tobacco manufacturers also specifically target young people in lower socioeconomic and minority neighborhoods and sell cheaper cigarettes in poor communities. This is an unconscionable strategy on the part of Big Tobacco. Another factor is that economic hardships, such as hunger, unstable housing and problems keeping the heat on are stressful and unhealthy for children. And childhood adversity is linked to unhealthy behaviors later, particularly to smoking. A Duke University study found that ""worries about paying bills or needing to sell possessions for cash independently erode a child's self-control, regardless of strong parenting."" That lack of self-control often leads to smoking. Women are quitting cigarettes at a lower rate than men. But women who are abused either physically or psychologically by their partners often smoke to cope with their tough lives. Strikingly, these connections between violence exposure and smoking can be seen in low-income women and in higher socioeconomic groups as well. Single mothers in poor neighborhoods are more likely to experience ""double jeopardy,"" with a high burden of childcare responsibilities coupled with social isolation and the chronic stress associated with neighborhood poverty. Smoking can be a reliable strategy to soften those burdens. The geography of opportunity and disadvantage is not equal across America. Clearly public health programs such as tobacco taxes and smoke-free public places and housing have worked in reducing smoking rates, but it seems poorer communities are being overlooked. Smoking is the top cause of preventable deaths in the United States. It causes lung cancer, heart disease, bronchitis, emphysema and more -- expensive health crises to add to the problems of the poor. To prevent smoking and keep young people from starting, it will take more than public health messages. It will require changing our economic policies to improve our neighborhood living conditions. People need well-paying jobs and safe communities to reduce the stress that often underlies smoking. Until we get real about the emotional toll of living in neighborhoods that offer little hope or help and stop the strong promotion of cigarettes, smoking will continue to be one strategy for coping among the most vulnerable members of our society.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Smoking is not declining in poor communities as it is in more affluent places .

"(CNN) -- You can find many things in Williams-Sonoma, the kitchenware retailer. Cookie sheets. Spatulas. And, oh yeah, an idea for treating gunshot wounds. At least, that's what RevMedx found. The U.S. military had asked the medical technology company to come up with a solution for stopping gunshot and shrapnel wounds from bleeding out. The working idea was a medical version of Fix-a-Flat, the foam you squirt in punctured tires to plug up a hole. (Perhaps the military had been browsing at Pep Boys.) Instead, it was a sponge that solved the problem, says Andrew Barofsky, RevMedx's CEO. ""One of the co-founders of the company, Dr. Ken Gregory, was shopping at a Williams-Sonoma and discovered this kitchen sponge that was dried and compressed. You'd bring it home, splash water under it, and it would pop up into a normal-sized kitchen sponge,"" he recalls. ""That was kind of a lightbulb moment."" Through a series of iterations, the concept was turned into XStat, a dose of tiny sponge-like discs that are injected into an open wound with a syringe. The sponges, which have been treated with an anti-hemorrhagic substance, expand to 10 times their size in seconds, both plugging the wound and providing needed compression to stanch the bleeding. It could be a revolutionary battlefield tool, says John Steinbaugh, a former Special Forces medic and the company's director of strategic development. In battle, life is measured in blood, and the standard method of plugging wounds -- packing them with gauze or tampons and then applying direct pressure for several minutes -- can take several minutes too long, he says. Bleeding out is a major cause of fatalities. ""Three to five minutes can mean the difference between life and death,"" he says. Medics were looking for something that ""you fire and forget,"" he says. ""You put it in and the bleeding instantly stops."" XStat received FDA approval in April, and RevMedx is now ready to get it into the hands of medics, says Barofsky. He expects to provide a limited quantity of XStats to the U.S. military in 2014, with the hopes of expanding the market to other clients -- such as paramedics and law enforcement officers -- in the future. Steinbaugh, who spent 25 years in the military, believes the XStat can be, literally, a life saver. ""Every drop of blood on the battlefield is precious,"" he says. ""The faster you can stop the bleeding, the higher the probability you can save a guy's life."" And you thought sponges were just for washing dishes.","XStat is an invention used to plug wounds .
Syringe filled with tiny sponges fills up wound, applies compression in seconds .

"(CNN) -- Ten years and 1.2 billion users into its existence, there's no question that Facebook has changed our lives. Whether it was an inspired vision, deft execution, a bit of dumb luck or a combination of all three, Mark Zuckerberg's social juggernaut has ingrained itself into the daily lives of digital-age users in a way that forebears like MySpace and contemporaries like Twitter could only imagine. Which is not to say it's all ""likes"" and ""shares"" and happy kid pics. As with any new (or newly discovered) technology, the impact of the end product is largely in the hands of the user. We are, after all, only human -- with all the joy and sadness, decency and ugliness that that entails. So here, as Facebook turns 10 on Tuesday, is a look back at five ways the social network has changed us -- for better and for worse. Share! Share! Share! The good: Wedding announcements? Thing of the past. Birth announcement? Just slap an Instagram shot of that bouncing baby boy or girl on your timeline. Dating? Graduated? Bought a house? Got a puppy? Same deal. We take it for granted now, but the ability to share major events with all the people closest to you with a single click of the mouse is unprecedented. There were the Myspaces of the world before Facebook. But mom, your second cousin and Aunt Jenny weren't on them. And it's not just the good stuff, either. Changing that relationship status to ""single"" can save you from those awkward ""How's Joey doing? You two are so cute together!"" conversations. The bad: Overshare! Overshare! Overshare! Seriously. Ten years in, some folks haven't figured out what everyone on their friends list wants, or needs, to know. OK, sometimes those pictures of your dinner look delicious. Sometimes. But the detailed updates on your mundane day are mind-numbing and the play-by-play of your 3-year-old's potty training is just -- too much. We all want to know you got a wedding ring. The fact that you just polished the one you've had for 14 years? Not so much. The past is not really past . The good: When a site has 1.2 billion users (OK, we all know some of those are multiple or abandoned accounts, so let's say at least a cool billion) it's a pretty amazing database of the world's Web-enabled population. That means your odds of finding just about anybody are a heck of a lot better than they were 10 years ago. There have been the remarkable tales, like the woman who -- after years of failed efforts -- reunited after 44 years with her birth mother. How long did it take on Facebook? Two days. For most of us, it's less dramatic than that. Childhood friends who moved long ago, college roommates who drifted away, even former teachers who served as inspirations are now but a quick search away. There's no doubt we have friends because of Facebook that we wouldn't have otherwise. The bad: Sometimes, drifting apart isn't a bad thing. Yes, your old high-school classmates got annoying and your cousin's politics disgust you. But we're not talking about that. We're talking about exes. And past flirtations. And cheating. Nostalgia is part of life. But, with Facebook, getting nostalgic about an old crush or flame could lead to a late-night Facebook message. Or, you know, a poke. ""I see Facebook issues breaking up marriages all the time,"" Gary Traystman, a divorce attorney in New London, Connecticut, told the Wall Street Journal. More than 80% of U.S. divorce attorneys say they've seen an increase in cases involving social media, according to the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, and one-third of all divorce filings last year contained the word Facebook, according to a survey by Divorce Online. Temptation is always out there. But with Facebook, it can be a little too convenient. It makes you happy . The good: In 2009, a survey of 2,600 college students by researchers at the University of Texas showed that those who were the heaviest users of Facebook were the most satisfied with their lives. They also were more likely to be engaged socially and politically. More recently, a University of Wisconsin study showed that, after five minutes of looking at their own shiny Facebook profiles, users experienced a significant boost in self-esteem. A 2011 Cornell University study delivered similar results. ""For many people, there's an automatic assumption that the Internet is bad,"" associate professor Jeffrey Hancock said at the time. ""This is one of the first studies to show that there's a psychological benefit of Facebook."" The bad: Or maybe it makes you unhappy. Other studies have looked at aspects of Facebook use and the results have been less encouraging. Last year, a University of Michigan researcher found that looking at posts by Facebook friends -- you know, the photos of smiling kids on vacation in the Caribbean or announcements about promotions, engagements and awesome nights on the town -- can make us feel sadder about our own humdrum lives. ""On the surface, Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling the basic human need for social connection,"" the study reads. ""Rather than enhancing well-being, however, these findings suggest that Facebook may undermine it."" As with many things, your mileage may very. But what's clear is that Facebook has become such a part of our lives that it tweaks our emotions, for better or worse. Every day is a reunion . The good: Reuniting with classmates from high school or college has never been easier. Pre-Facebook, a class reunion committee looking to celebrate five, 10 or 20 years post-diploma faced a thankless task. ""Where does Jennifer live these days?"" ""Who has Steven's phone number?"" ""Do you know Wanda's married name?"" Now? One Facebook event invitation and you can focus on booking the best '80s cover band available. The bad: If every day is a reunion, why have a reunion? Actually reuniting with old classmates is losing some of its appeal when we know the names of the former theater club president's three kids and which character from ""The Hunger Games"" she'd be. Timothy Davis, co-founder of reunion website Classreport.com, told the Baltimore Sun that he has noticed a drop-off in the number of reunions in recent years, particularly among folks in their mid- to late 20s. ""People I haven't talked to in years will see my wedding pictures on Facebook, then I'll see them in person and we won't say one word to each other ...,"" Rebecca Miller, a 23-year-old whose five-year reunion fizzled to a small party at the class president's house, told the paper. ""Why go to a high school reunion when you're going to stand around and go, 'So, how did that doctor's appointment go yesterday?'"" Privacy . The good: For those willing to find and use them, Facebook provides tools that let you select who sees what. So, while grandma is welcome to look at those pics of the kids playing in the snow, she might not need to be privy to your strongly worded rant about the cable guy who is two days late. You can direct that one instead to buddies with a proper appreciation for your expansive vocabulary. Rival Twitter is designed by default to be a public forum, where you broadcast your 140-character pearls of wisdom to the world. Facebook allows that, too, but is more geared toward limiting your thoughts to certain family and friends. The bad: Well, you know. Security breaches have been a reality of many websites' growth. But as its user base grew dramatically, Facebook's problems (like the time CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg got his own page hacked) played out in front of a massive, and nervous, audience. While Facebook has privacy settings that let users protect information, some privacy advocates say the network doesn't make them easy enough to find and use. (Facebook has worked to ease those concerns, especially for younger users). At the end of the day, Facebook benefits when you decide to share more openly. The details about your life that you share on Facebook are rounded up and compiled into a profile of you that helps advertisers target you with things they think you'll like. So, when you announced your pregnancy and were, soon after, bombarded with Facebook ads for a bunch of baby stuff? That was no coincidence. To be clear, Facebook is not handing advertisers information about you personally. But, somewhere, there exists a nameless profile of a user with your hometown, gender, age and likes and dislikes, just waiting to be used for marketing purposes. That, in a nutshell, is the entry fee to use this remarkable social tool. Yes, Facebook has changed the way we communicate. Whether it is truly cost-free remains another question.","Facebook turns 10 next week and has undeniably changed how many of us live .
For many of those changes, there are positive and negative sides .
In the Facebook age, there's rarely such thing as a long-lost friend .
But some folks still haven't figured out etiquette of social sharing ."
"(CNN) -- Halle Berry has a hefty new expense. The Oscar-winning actress has to pay over $16,000 in child support each month to her ex, Gabriel Aubry, to provide for their 6-year-old daughter Nahla, the Los Angeles Superior Court ordered. Berry's monthly bill will remain in effect until Nahla turns 19 or graduates high school, whichever occurs first, according to court documents obtained by CNN. The settlement came on May 30, at the end of lengthy child support legal battle. The court also ordered Berry to pay $115,000 retroactively in child support, as well as to cover her ex-boyfriend's legal fees, which amount to $300,000. The ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" star is fully responsible for Nahla's tuition, while both parents will divide health care costs. Berry and the Canadian model met in 2005 and split in spring 2010 and have since been entangled in bitter custody and child support litigation. Tensions erupted in a physical altercation between Aubry and Berry's husband, Olivier Martinez, on Thanksgiving Day 2012, when Aubry came to Berry's home to drop off then 4-year-old Nahla. Berry and Aubry's legal battles also include Berry seeking to relocate their daughter to France, and Nahla's nanny filing a restraining order against Aubry. Since their custody dispute came to an end in spring 2011, both parents have shared equal custody of Nahla. Nahla is Aubry's only child. Berry is a mother of two. She gave birth to a son with Martinez in October of last year.","Halle Berry must pay Gabriel Aubry $16,000 a month in child support, a court rules .

"(CNN) -- At Camp 3 of Mount Everest at an altitude of 7,200 meters, an American woman, 50-year-old Cleonice Pacheco Weidlich, sits in a solitary tent. Outside, fierce winds of more than 50 knots are raging. She waits. Soon blizzard-bearing monsoon clouds will gather around Everest and bring an end to the climbing season on the high Himalayas. It will also draw a shroud over one of the single deadliest tragedies the world's highest mountain has ever witnessed. Before she can make begin her ascent, Weidlich must not only find a gap in the weather and a way over the avalanche, but also face down the growing controversies that erupted around continued activity on Everest in the wake of the disaster. More than 300 international climbers abandoned their goal of reaching the mountain's summit after an April 18 avalanche in the mountain's treacherous Khumbu Icefall killed 16 Nepalese Sherpa mountaineers. The immediate aftermath of the disaster brought confusion and anger to the mountain as arguments raged over whether climbing should continue, the money paid to Sherpas and compensation for the sacrifices made. After avalanche, Nepal opens up unclimbed peaks . Domino effect . Some Sherpas called an unofficial moratorium on further climbs, with one group even reportedly sabotaging equipment. With safety in doubt, many international climbing companies decided to pull the plug, leading to a domino effect that also swept up the independent climbers who rely on shared resources. ""If 30% of your workforce walks away, it compromises your operational capabilities, given the difficulties of finding new porters, cooks, and guides in short time in the Khumbu,"" said one guide from a leading operator. Many were resigned to the sudden end to the season. ""I feel very sad about the Sherpas,"" said Ake Lindstrom, an adventure operator from Tanzania. ""Everybody knows each other; it is a small community and their loss is very tangible. It takes a small amount of empathy to let go of one's frustration."" Weidlich, however, stayed. Later she was joined by Wang Jing, a 41-year-old Chinese woman also determined to press ahead with an attempt on the summit. Despite their determination in the face of calls for a halt to climbing, many Sherpas CNN Travel spoke to were not unhappy with their plans. Instead, they voiced other concerns, including the disparity they perceive between local and international guide salaries, overcrowding on the mountain, a lack of respect to their mountain god and those who died. There was also anger towards the Nepalese government over its response to the tragedy. Among the Everest climbing community questions were raised about the safety prior to the deaths. Some Sherpas said there had been too many on the mountain on the day of the disaster, with long lines forming as people traversed the ladders over crevasses. Mourning in an Everest Sherpa village . 'One mistake and you are done' ""It was so packed that for some, there was no place to hide when the ice started to fall,"" one said. ""We never saw so many people on the icefall on one day."" One expert expressed strong concerns about renewed climbing. ""The mountains are in constant movement, which is what makes the icefall dangerous,"" said Gian Piero Verza, of the Pyramid high-altitude research center, located at 5,050 meters on Everest. ""You have to consider that in two months of expeditions, some Sherpas spend an average of three hours daily on the icefall to carry their load. For some that is 200 hours in a very dangerous place."" Veteran expedition leader Jamie McGuinness, however, said he was surprised that more did not defy the exodus to take advantage of conditions similar to those when Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay first summited in 1953. ""Hard-core mountaineers would jump at the chance to have Everest and Lhotse all for themselves during the best climbing season,"" he says. ""But being there without backup is like being back in epic Hillary's time: one mistake and you are done."" Back at Camp 3, in her gale-battered tent, Weidlich is convinced she is doing the right thing by continuing with her plan to summit Lhotse, a peak connected to Everest's South Col. She says she knows the family of one of the victims and when she visited them after the disaster was not met with hostility and was invited to stay for the funeral. ""I asked them if they felt it would be disrespectful if I continued with my climbing plan,"" she says. ""They were concerned about my safety, but they never brought up the issue of respect."" Weidlich, who is on a personal mission to climb all 14 of the world's mountains over 8,000 meters, says the problem lies with assisted climbing. ""High mountains are dangerous, and climbing is all about the experience. You have to evaluate the risks. But Everest has become a completely different place: it is a showtime place. People come here to make silly records. American climber recounts how Sherpa saved his life . Climbing in isolation . ""This is not real mountaineering. To me, if you cannot free climb a mountain and you need someone else to help you up or down, you don't belong on it."" Weidlich hits out at claims that Sherpas had forced people to abandon the mountain saying they had treated her well. She also speaks of the excitement of climbing in isolation. ""I am very much looking forward to experiencing the mountain for what it is, without the crowds. It will be rewarding to be in contact with nature -- to hear the cracking of the ice and not the generators."" When at last the gales ease, it is finally time for Weidlich to face the mountain, but she is ultimately unable to reach her goal. Because of the dangers on the Icefall, both Weidlich and Wang bypass it using helicopters -- a highly controversial move that could invalidate any claim to a successful climb. Wang reaches the summit of Everest on May 23 along with five Sherpas. Weidlich, however, decides to abandon her attempt on Lhotse because ""that would be like claiming a whole mountain when I would only have climbed half of it."" Shortly afterward, the monsoon closes in for good, leaving Everest to brood alone over another season of triumphs for some and tragedies for others. Andrea Oschetti is a Hong Kong-based freelance travel writer currently traveling through Bhutan and Nepal.","Cleonice Pacheco Weidlich refuses to abandon her Everest climb after 16 killed in mountain tragedy .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Congressional Budget Office is now estimating that limits on medical malpractice lawsuits -- reforms favored by many Republicans -- could save the government as much as $54 billion over the next 10 years. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has raised questions about how much malpractice reform would save. The government spends about $2.5 trillion on health care every year. A tort reform package that includes caps on jury awards of $500,000 for punitive damages and $250,000 for ""pain and suffering"" damages would lower liability insurance premiums by about 10 percent, according to a report from the nonpartisan office issued late last week. Such laws would lower expenditures on government programs like Medicare and Medicaid by roughly $41 billion, according to the report. An additional $13 billion would be gained from taxable wages over 10 years as employers reduce the amount they spend on health care.  Watch a report on the findings » . The research was revealed in a letter sent Friday from Douglas Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office, to Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Republican who has raised questions about how much malpractice reform would save. But the reform package outlined in the report seems unlikely to pass, since the White House opposes capping jury awards. Two Democratic senators told CNN's ""State of the Union with John King"" on Sunday that regulating malpractice lawsuits is a flawed solution. ""I don't think the way to go is to limit the rights of Americans who are injured by negligent or intentional conduct,"" Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey told CNN. ""A $250,000 cap on damages, in my humble opinion, is insulting to our system of justice."" Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow suggested that the Republican approach to malpractice reform was too simplistic. She said limits on damages imposed in Michigan had not stemmed increases in the malpractice insurance rates paid by doctors.","Report sees savings from limits on medical malpractice suits in next 10 years .

"(CNN) -- The primaries are mostly over and the general election races are falling into place. All 435 seats in the House and a third of the Senate are up for election on November 4 in what's expected to be a difficult year for Democrats. Here's what's on the line: . Control of the Senate: That's the big story of the year. Republicans have their best chance of retaking the majority since they lost it in the 2006 midterms. The GOP must realize a net gain of six seats to accomplish the turnaround with Democrats currently holding a 55-45 advantage (53 Democrats and two independents who caucus with them). And for Democrats, it's not looking good. Key Senate races . Three seats total in South Dakota, West Virginia and Montana are almost certain to flip to Republicans. And another seven Democratic-held seats are at risk. In contrast, Republicans have a chance of losing only two seats. ""It's a healthier environment overall for Republicans,"" Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said. The status of the House: Little is expected to change in the House. While some members will lose, it's expected to remain in Republican hands. The GOP currently has a strong advantage: They control 234 seats to 201 for Democrats. What team wouldn't love a 33-point advantage on game day? Key House races . Like in the Senate, Republicans are performing better. Despite bold predictions from the No. 2 House Democrat, Steny Hoyer, no one believes Democrats have any chance of taking back the House. ""It looks like Republicans will gain seats we just don't know how many yet,"" Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, said. Why won't Democrats pick up seats?: In part, it's the six-year itch. President Barack Obama has been in office for six years and voters get antsy and want change. Since they can't change the President, they vote for the opposing party in congressional elections. ""Historically, the President's party tends to lose,"" Duffy said. Obama's job performance, an approval rating that hovers around 41%, is making a tough situation for Democrats worse. ""The President's job approval rating is casting a shadow on races across the country,"" Gonzales said. Obama is a drag in two respects: It's a difficult environment for Democrats who need Republican voters in Republican-leaning districts, and Democratic voters are not motivated to show up at the polls. The latter is called the enthusiasm gap and traditionally Democratic voters, minorities, single women and younger voters, are not motivated to vote. The role of the tea party: Tea party-aligned challengers had a tough year. unlike 2010 and 2012, when several too-far-to-the-right candidates won in primaries, Incumbent Republicans entered the primaries prepared, taking nothing for granted. And it paid off. Incumbents won in hard fought races, including in Mississippi, Idaho, Kentucky and Kansas. But the anti establishment wing of the Republican Party didn't come up empty. One of its victories was a big one -- the defeat of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. After bruising battles, the question is this: Will Republicans unite in November? Duffy said that if 2012 and 2010 are indicators, it will. ""What we can see ... they have united behind whoever won,"" Duffy said. ""I don't think at the end of the day (disappointed Republicans are) going to stay home."" A bright spot for Democrats?: When it comes to gubernatorial races, Republicans are defending 22 of the 36 seats up for grabs in November. And some of them are in states that Obama carried in 2008 and 2012, such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, Maine, Nevada and New Mexico. But Democrats also have some vulnerable seats to defend, in Arkansas, Colorado and Illinois. And they won't have cakewalks in Connecticut and Massachusetts . Key governor races . Still about Obamacare: For the first several months of the year while the Affordable Care Act seemed to be a rolling disaster, Republicans made it the main issue in campaign, attacking Democrats for their support of the law. Elizabeth Wilner, senior vice president with Kantar Ad Intelligence, which analyzes political advertising, said that Republicans are still hitting Democratic opponents on Obamacare but it is not the only one. ""Obamcare is still an issue, but maybe a bit less of an issue than earlier this year,"" she said. In addition to the Affordable Care Act, Republicans are also attacking Democrats on ties to the President and government spending. In political advertising, Democrats are trying to change the subject and are focusing on jobs, women's rights, Medicare and Social Security. Regardless, Wilner said analysis shows that up to $3.4 billion is expected to be spent on political advertising this campaign season. Current events: A border crisis and international conflicts are dominating the news cycle just a few months before the election. While the storylines aren't overwhelming topics of discussion on the campaign trail, Stu Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report wrote that the events ""will add to the President's woes."" ""As uncomfortable as it will make Democrats, Obama heads into the final three months of the campaign not looking all that different from his predecessor, President Bush,"" he wrote. Bush was dealing with a difficult economy, ongoing and unpopular wars and the aftermath of a disastrous response to Hurricane Katrina. The role of the money men: And yes, the biggest spenders are men. Since the Supreme Court's Citizen's United campaign finance decision in 2010, the role of individual investors in the political sphere has grown. Wealthy entrepreneurs Charles and David Koch spent $130 million in 2012 through their organization Americans for Prosperity, which works to defeat Democrats. They also donated money directly to candidates and political action committees as well. A wealthy former hedge fund manager, Tom Steyer, hopes to play big as well. Focusing on climate change, he pledged to spend up to $50 million of his own money and hopes to raise another $50 million. We'll have to wait and see how the high rollers play in the midterms -- that is if we ever find out because much of the spending doesn't have to be made public. Opening act for 2016: Let's face it, the midterms haven't even happened yet but the 2016 presidential race is well under way. Potential presidential hopefuls are already spending large amounts of time in early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina and building networks by backing candidates in critical presidential states, in hopes that the favor is returned in 2016.

"Berlin (CNN) -- Twenty-five years on from the fall of the Berlin Wall, much has changed. But former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev says the lessons learned back then could help restore calm to today's increasingly volatile world. Speaking to CNN in Berlin, where he is attending anniversary celebrations, Gorbachev called for efforts to rebuild trust between East and West and for leaders to again work together for the common good. ""A lot depends on America, Europe, Russia -- they have to work together more productively,"" he said. ""We have to reestablish the cooperation and the trust that has been destroyed. We must start by dialogue -- we must meet and not just talk past each other."" Gorbachev, now 83, is often praised for his decision to avoid using force to quell uprisings in Eastern Europe, helping pave the way for Berlin Wall to fall in 1989. While Soviet leader -- from 1985 until his resignation in 1991 -- he embarked on a process of change and increased openness to the West that became known as ""perestroika."" He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990 for helping end the Cold War. Now, with the conflict in Ukraine plunging East-West relations to their lowest point since then, many wonder what might happen next, as a bullish Russia seems determined to forge its own course despite pressure from the West. Leaders today 'looking askance at each other' While the nuclear weapon reduction agreements signed at the end of the Cold War still have a positive influence, Gorbachev said, current events in Europe could undermine the situation. ""Straight after the end of the Cold War, when we signed those important agreements, we used to be more peaceful, people trusted more. People trusted that things got better,"" he said. ""Now is a troublesome time. Let us not engage in mutual accusations, let us rebuild the trust that has been wrecked and let us cooperate, let us look for ways out of any difficult situation,"" he said. Defeating radical groups like ISIS ""requires a common effort on our part,"" he said. But while the possibilities and the resources are there, leading countries have been looking to serve their own advantage. This is wrong, he said, and the first steps to correct it must include political decision making and dialogue. Some people's impression that things have moved backward today is correct, he said, adding, ""this is because the common approach has been destroyed."" When leaders took decisions on nuclear disarmament or on ending the Cold War, he said, ""with all these things we were meeting each other halfway, we cooperated. But now we are just looking askance at each other."" Report: Ex-Soviet leader Gorbachev leaves hospital . Media 'sow division and mistrust' Gorbachev said some irresponsible media outlets were fueling international tensions. The media should convey the truth, he said, rather than taking part in ""information warfare"" that ""sows division and mistrust."" He characterized recent reports of Russia sending tanks and troops into Ukraine as examples of dangerously irresponsible reporting. Gorbachev called for those who benefit from manipulating media coverage to be revealed, even if that carries some risk to those doing the revealing. He did not single out any media outlets, but said it is up to politicians to prevent ""information warfare"" while also defending freedom of the press and civil institutions. Asked what lesson people should draw from the historic events of 25 years ago, Gorbachev said: ""We made the right choice. We made the right decision, these decisions required courage, these decisions required a lot of work -- and this is the only right approach, acting responsibly, acting with a view to common efforts."" No one can single-handedly solve the problems of the world today, he said, even America. Gorbachev: Obama must stand firm . As for President Barack Obama, the former Soviet leader had some positive words -- and encouragement for the difficult days ahead for the President's Democratic Party, which was hammered in the midterm elections. His election in 2008 was a response to the American people's desire for change and reform -- their own perestroika, Gorbachev said. ""At first he showed himself as a person who could be trusted, a smart person, an intelligent person, and his first term I would say he was quite satisfactory,"" Gorbachev said. Now, with both the House and Senate in Republican hands and a raft of other problems stacking up, Obama must ""stand firm,"" he said. ""It's not the most important thing to be in power. It's important to withstand the pressure of those who would like to bend your knees."" CNN's Jim Clancy reported from Berlin and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","Mikhail Gorbachev: America, Europe, Russia must work together more productively .

"(CNN) -- Twinkly lights and tinsel? That's so last Christmas. Christmas trees don't have to be traditional to look spectacular. In fact, some of the most memorable ones this year are anything but. How about a Christmas tree made from Lego? Or macaroons? Even the odder entrants in this selection of the world's most amazing Christmas trees on public display tend to be big and bright. And there are still plenty of sparkly stars to be found and photographed. They're just much bigger and much brighter than the ones on the tree in your living room. 1. Vilnius Christmas tree (Lithuania) The well-preserved old town in the Lithuanian capital looks like just the sort of place that needs a Christmas tree. Now it's got one -- and it's 25 meters tall. It's not so much a tree as a metal skeleton covered with fir tree branches. Lithuanian fir tree branches, though -- they're not made in China. Vilnius Christmas Tree, Cathedral Square, Vilnius, Lithuania . 2. Lego Christmas tree (Legoland Malaysia) Asia's tallest Christmas tree is in Malaysia, but even more striking than its height is that it's made from Lego. The nine-meter tree at Legoland Malaysia is made from 400,000 blocks of the child's toy. More than 300 Lego baubles, including candles and slightly kinky multicolored chains, have been snapped on. It's not a tree, either? C'mon -- where's your Christmas spirit? Legoland Malaysia, Bandar Medini Iskandar Malaysia, Nusajaya, Johor, Malaysia; +607 597 8888 . 3. Rockefeller Center Christmas tree (New York) The unveiling of this 23-meter Norwegian spruce was a star-studded affair -- Mariah Carey, Leona Lewis and the Goo Goo Dolls performed. Weighing 12 tons, the tree is decorated with 45,000 LEDS and topped with a 3-meter-wide Swarovski crystal star. The tree was donated to the Rockefeller Center by the Vargoshe family, who planted it in the gardens of their Connecticut home 20 years ago. And eventually wanted to get rid of it. Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York; +1 212 588 8601 . 4. Galeries Lafayette Christmas tree (Paris) At 20-meters tall, the world's highest in-store Christmas tree is an intricate, horology-themed affair standing in France's chicest department store, Galeries Lafayette. Celebrating its 30th birthday this year, Swiss watchmaker Swatch helped design the tree, including the toy village at its base that springs to life on the hour. Batteries not included. And try getting the thing home. Galeries Lafayette (French site only), 40 boulevard Haussmann, Paris; +33 09 69 39 75 75 . 5. Floating Christmas tree (Rio de Janeiro) Rio advertizes its superlative seasonal contribution as ""the world's largest floating Christmas tree."" Turns out it may be the world's only notable floating Christmas tree, save those dumped in various water supplies when the celebrations are over. Nonetheless, its stats are pretty impressive. More than 100,000 people turned out to see the 85-meter, 540-ton behemoth lit up for the first time in the waters off Rio. Bradesco Seguros Christmas Tree, Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, Rio de Janeiro . 6. National Christmas tree (Washington, D.C.) Last year, the Obamas were criticized for decorating their home with an apparently excessive 54 Christmas trees. This year, they have only 24. Modest. Barack Obama was tasked with switching on the 10-meter Colorado blue spruce known as the National Christmas Tree, which stands outside the White House gates in President's Park South. The tree is a permanent fixture, looked after by the National Park Service -- which keeps that itchy foliage from getting everywhere when it comes time to trash most trees, post-Christmas. National Christmas Tree, 17th and D Streets NW, Washington, D.C.; +1 202 354 6460 . 7. Brandenburg Gate Christmas tree (Berlin) Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Norway has given the German capital a Christmas tree every year as a sign of peace and solidarity with the reunified country. The decorations on this year's tree, located as always beneath the Brandenburg Gate, are a bit of a contrast. They're a freebie from Wintershall, Germany's largest crude oil and natural gas producer. Nothing ironic there. Brandenburg Gate Christmas tree, Pariser Platz, Berlin . 8. Macaroon Christmas tree, Ritz-Carlton (Charlotte, North Carolina) The Christmas tree at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Charlotte, North Carolina, is edible: it's made from 8,000 colorful macaroons. Using 10,008 egg whites, 110 cups of sugar and 57 cups of almonds, the hotel's pastry team took 58 hours to create -- or should that be bake -- the tree. Ritz-Carlton Charlotte, 201 East Trade Street, Charlotte, North Carolina; +1 704 547 2244 . 9. Umbrella tree, Goring hotel (London) Luxury umbrella brand Fulton made the tree outside London's Goring hotel, so it's not hard to guess which popular winter accessory features heavily. Mirrored baubles designed to represent raindrops are interspersed with miniature umbrellas set with sequined crystals. One of the brand's trademark birdcage-style umbrellas -- supposedly a favorite of the British royal family -- replaces the traditional star at the top of the tree. Good thing Trojan doesn't make a Chrismas tree -- they don't right? The Goring, Beeston Place, London; +44 7396 9000 . 10. Opera Christmas tree, Grand Hotel de Bordeaux & Spa (Bordeaux, France) Decorated with elaborate opera costumes, yards of lace and hundreds of crystals, the Christmas tree at the Grand Hôtel de Bordeaux & Spa is the fruit of a collaboration with L'Opera National de Bordeaux. The hotel and the opera house share a baroque style, as does the tree -- which sings in a nice soprano. Not really. Grand Hôtel de Bordeaux & Spa, 2-5 Place de la Comédie, Bordeaux, France; +33 5 57 30 44 44 . 11. Fendi Christmas tree, Hotel de Russie (Rome) A creation of the Italian fashion house Fendi, the Christmas tree at Rome's Hotel de Russie is unsurprisingly hung all over with the brand's plexiglass ""bag bug"" handbags. The tree at nearby Palazzo Fendi (the fashion house's headquarters) has a similar theme, but with miniature Fendi baguette bags being used instead. Can't help imagining that's one itchy tree. Hotel de Russie in Rome, Via del Babuino 9, Rome; +39 06 328881 . 12. Recycled bottle Christmas tree (London) Humble in origin but still impressive, the Christmas tree outside Ealing Town Hall in London was crafted from 900 plastic bottles collected by local school children. Made by artist Ashley Phillips, the tree has a serious message: that more waste is produced over the festive season than at any other time of year. Possibly including these bottles when everyone's done with the tree. Recycled bottle Christmas tree, Ealing Town Hall, London; +44 20 8825 5000 .

"(CNN) -- Earlier this week, Dr. Mehmet Oz, host of the popular ""The Dr. Oz Show,"" conceded that there's no long-term miracle weight loss pill. This is despite his previous use of the word ""miracle"" to describe the weight loss effects of forskolin, raspberry ketones, sea buckthorn, garcinia cambogia, African mango seed and green coffee bean extract. Dr. Oz said his job on the show ""is to be a cheerleader for the audience (when) they don't think they have hope"" But hope is not the same as good advice, and, as Dr. Oz noted, none of these recommendations have proven miraculous. ""Cheerleading"" as described by Dr. Oz has contributed to the creation of a weight loss market that is overwhelmingly ineffective yet highly profitable, with sales at $60 billion per year. The demand is there. Among U.S. adults, 68% are overweight or obese and as many as 100 million are trying to lose weight at any given time. Annually, obesity accounts for about $200 billion, or about 20%, of our health care costs. It costs billions more in worker absenteeism and lost productivity. Over 80% of people who lose 10% or more of their weight will regain it, and for all the new treatments, that number hasn't really improved in a generation. This is not to say that we shouldn't join Dr. Oz in offering hope. We should seek hope by investing in new ideas and more personalized approaches to combating the obesity epidemic rather than by embracing anecdotal ""miracles."" One way is to focus on obesity prevention, which starts in the home, school and community. Numerous studies suggest that the behaviors we learn early in life influence our behavior as adults. (I know that my parents always told me to eat a vegetable with lunch and dinner. To this day, if I am running late for work and just have time to grab a hot dog, I feel a scowling avatar of my mother pop up on my left shoulder). We can potentially delay or even prevent adult diseases by fostering better health habits in our children. Schools are an excellent venue in which to orient families toward healthy behavior. Teachers, in addition to providing health and physical education, can serve as role models and engage parents about good health practices for their children. Unfortunately, most public schools, including those in New York, do not meet their mandates for providing minimal physical education. And in general, there isn't enough focus on good dietary and exercise habits in school-based health initiatives. The need for a multipronged approach utilizing actions in communities, schools, businesses, families and health care providers to prevent obesity has been recognized by many federal programs (such as Michelle Obama's Let's Move campaign), state programs (such as New York's), and local programs (such as in Chicago or Los Angeles). Obesity prevention proposals have raised important questions regarding costs and long-term efficacy. It should be noted that some studies have shown that cost-effective, school-based interventions can be implemented, slow weight gain and yield other health benefits such as improved insulin sensitivity or cholesterol level in children. While it has not been determined whether these benefits persist after the program is stopped, the potential financial and health gains as a result of delaying the onset of obesity by even a few years would be huge. We need to start early at home, in classrooms, neighborhoods and even in the pediatrician's office. The risk of a fat child becoming a fat adult is doubled at age 2-3 but over 20-fold after age 9. Behavioral interventions appear more effective if started in early childhood. Exploration of new preventive measures should require detailed assessment of their short- and long-term efficacy so they are adequately vetted before they become policy. We should demand that our schools emphasize life-prep as well as test-prep and that failure of schools to fulfill their physical education obligations is treated with the same severity as failing to meet academic obligations. School lunches should be a part of school education and we must actively oppose efforts to undermine them, such as recent Republican efforts to allow schools to opt out of requirements for more fruits and vegetables in meals -- an improvement that arose from the 2010 Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act. Health education is a learning process, and like any academic area, it needs to be developed over time. Good nutrition and exercise habits are good for all of us -- fat or thin -- and most of us could use a refresher course. There is hope, but we have to use common sense and good science to make sure we're on the right path. As Charles Darwin put it, ""the more we know of the fixed laws of nature the more incredible do miracles become.""","Michael Rosenbaum: Dr. Mehmet Oz says there's no long-term miracle weight loss pill .

"(CNN) -- Running back Todd Gurley, one of the front-runners for college football's Heisman Trophy, was suspended indefinitely on Thursday by the University of Georgia as the school investigates a possible violation of NCAA rules. ""I'm obviously very disappointed,"" Georgia head football coach Mark Richt said in a two-paragraph statement on the school's athletics department website. Gurley has rushed for 773 yards in five games and scored eight touchdowns for 10th-ranked Georgia. He also had a 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown. The Bulldogs are scheduled to play at Missouri on Saturday. Georgia didn't say what kind of alleged violation officials are investigating.

"(CNN) -- Enterovirus D68 is likely coming -- if it hasn't already -- to a state near you. Since mid-August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had confirmed 153 cases of respiratory illness caused by Enterovirus D68 in 18 states: Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The California Department of Health has confirmed four cases in patients in San Diego and Ventura counties. And ""in the upcoming weeks, more states will have confirmed cases of EV-D68 infection,"" the CDC said in a statement Wednesday. ""Several states are investigating clusters of people with severe respiratory illness, and specimens are still being tested for EV-D68. It can take a while to test specimens and obtain lab results... These increases will not necessarily reflect changes in real time, or mean that the situation is getting worse."" Canadian health officials have confirmed three cases of Enterovirus D68 in British Columbia. A fourth suspected case from a patient with severe respiratory illness is still under investigation. Two of the confirmed cases are children between 5 and 9, said Dr. Danuta Skowronski, lead epidemiologist on emerging respiratory viruses at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control. The third is a teen between 15 and 19. Enteroviruses are very common. The CDC estimates that 10 million to 15 million infections occur in the United States each year. These viruses usually appear like the common cold; symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and a cough. Most people recover without any treatment. But Enterovirus D68 seems to be exacerbating breathing problems in children who have asthma. The virus is hard to track as many enteroviruses cause similar symptoms and hospitals generally do not test for specific types. But health officials have asked doctors to send in samples if they suspect that Enterovirus D68 has caused a patient's severe respiratory illness. Enteroviruses ""tend to have a summer-fall pattern,"" Skowronski said, so the high number of cases will likely subside over the next few months. What parents should know . In the meantime, parents should be on the lookout for the symptoms of Enterovirus D68. Unfortunately, in the beginning it's difficult -- if not impossible -- to tell the difference between a regular cold and this type of virus. But if your child develops a fever or a rash, or if he has difficulty breathing, seek medical attention right away. Children with asthma or a history of breathing problems are particularly susceptible for severe symptoms. CNN's Jen Christensen, Matthew Stucker and Teri Genova contributed to this story.","NEW: CDC confirms 153 cases of Enterovius D68 in 18 states .

"Washington (CNN) -- The problem-plagued F-22 Raptor took part in its first combat mission Monday night, hitting ISIS targets in Syria. The price tag for those jets, which were in development for decades, is a staggering $412 million each -- triple its expected cost, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Originally designed and built to replace other fighter and ground attack aircraft in the U.S. military's arsenal, the radar-evading F-22 is an evolutionary dead end. The Air Force acquired only 188 of them from aerospace maker Lockheed and doesn't plan to have any more produced. Even though they formally came into service in 2005, the F-22 had been grounded repeatedly because of what were indeterminate causes that resulted in pilots losing consciousness in the air. Obama: Syria strikes show 'this is not America's fight alone' The Air Force is confident it solved the problem, but some top pilots still refused to fly the plane, citing safety concerns. Today, the Air Force has 187 of the fighters after one crashed in 2010, killing the pilot. A subsequent report by the Pentagon watchdog found the Air Force initially blamed the crash on pilot error when in fact a mechanical error was at fault. The F-22 has also been accused of causing a mysterious illness in mechanics charged with maintaining it. In 2012: More problems for F-22 . Last year, the Air Force lifted all flight restrictions on the F-22, saying the plane is now safe to fly. The military's other prized fighter program, the F-35 fighter-bomber, has faced similar questions about massive cost overruns and mechanical problems.","The F-22 flew its first combat mission against ISIS .

"(CNN) -- One poster said ""Censoring history = No Education."" Another read ""We deserve to know the truth."" The signs were just a few lining the streets as hundreds of students from at least seven Denver-area schools walked out of their classrooms Tuesday and Wednesday to protest a proposal by a member of the Jefferson County School Board, according to CNN affiliates KDVR and KMGH. The proposal calls for a new panel to review the schools' curricula, but that's not the part that has students and parents outraged. It is the call for a review of the Advanced Placement curriculum for U.S. history classes to ensure that teaching materials present positive aspects of U.S. history and its heritage. According to the wording of the proposal, teaching materials should ""promote citizenship, patriotism ... (and) respect for authority"" and not ""encourage or condone civil disorder, social strife or disregard of the law."" ""I understand that they want to take out our very important history of slavery and dropping the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki because it portrays the U.S. in a negative light,"" said Casey McAndrew, a high school senior. Banned Book Week: 10 of the most challenged books of 2013 . Ben Murky, a high school junior, said, ""The censorship of U.S. history is wrong, and I think it's pretty communist."" The protest followed walkouts by students on Monday and a protest Friday, when at least 50 teachers called in sick, according to KDVR. ""I think it's time we hear from the kids on how it's impacting them, because it is, and it's very scary for them what's happening here,"" parent Andrea Stevens said. Jefferson County Superintendent Dan McMinimee tried to stem the outrage by stressing that no changes in the curriculum have been finalized. ""I think some students think this is a done deal when, in fact, it was a discussion by our board based on a resolution that one of our board members brought forward,"" McMinimee said. ""There was a vigorous discussion on Thursday evening. It was tabled. "" Are you there? Share images . McMinimee has visited several high schools in the past few days and met with large and small groups of students to answer their questions and listen to ""their legitimate concerns,"" he said in a statement. ""I respect the right of our students to express their opinions in a peaceful manner. However, I do prefer that our students stay in class and in their buildings,"" McMinimee said. The school board members have not responded to a request for comment. SOS for stressed-out teens . Julie Williams, the board member advocating the history review, issued a statement after the protests, according to KDVR. ""Balance and respect for traditional scholarship is NOT censorship,"" she said. ""Again we believe that exposure to the curriculum itself, not inflammatory rhetoric, will convince most parents that a review committee is a very good idea."" School board President Ken Witt said the goal is to give all of the community more of a say in what's taught in classrooms. ""The idea is to make certain that we are expanding community involvement and community voice in curriculum,"" Witt said. ""That's not censorship. That's the opposite of censorship. This is exactly what these students would want, I hope."" Judging by the hundreds of students who are trying to make their voices heard, it doesn't appear that kind of community voice in curriculum is what they want. Why some schools are ditching grades . ""They want to take away our curriculum in U.S. history,"" said Ava Koppschlager, a sophomore.""We deserve to know everything that went on.""

"(CNN) -- The Miami Dolphins have suspended a defensive lineman after he allegedly touched women and then took an ""aggressive fighting stance"" when police attempted to arrest him, according to a probable cause affidavit. Police arrested Derrick Shelby after using a stun gun on him three times, according to a supplemental police report. Shelby, 25, who is in his third season with the team, was at a Fort Lauderdale dance club early Saturday when security guards told police he was causing a disturbance, the affidavit says. Shelby was ""touching females at location without their permission,"" it says. Security removed him from the club, and a police officer told him several times to stop obstructing a roadway and the club entrance. Shelby refused, according to police, and asked the officer, ""What are you going to do?"" Appearing to be intoxicated, he began filming and photographing the officer, who called for backup, the affidavit states. Shelby was again asked to leave and refused before police told him he was under arrest for trespassing. ""Upon attempting to place Shelby into custody he began pushing away from officers and took an aggressive fighting stance,"" the affidavit says. ""Shelby was placed on the ground, where he was actively resisting and attempting to brace his arms to defeat efforts to place him into custody."" Shelby was ""overpowering officers,"" according to the supplemental report, so an officer used a stun gun on him, but to no effect because of ""the proximity of the prongs on his back."" The officer used the stun gun on him again in the right shoulder, ""which was temporarily effective in gaining more control over Shelby, but he immediately returned to actively resisting and trying to free his other hand,"" the report says. After police stunned Shelby a third time, they were able to take him into custody and transport him to a local hospital and then the Broward Sheriff's Office jail. He was charged with resisting without violence and trespass after warning, both misdemeanors, police documents say. He was released on a $100 bond, according to CNN affiliate WFOR-TV. A mug shot released by the sheriff's office shows a bloodied Shelby with obvious injuries to his lip and left cheek. A woman at defense attorney Daniel Rosenberg's office said Rosenberg was in court Monday morning and would comment later. Phone and email messages weren't immediately returned, but Rosenberg told The Miami Herald that Shelby ""maintains his innocence"" and said the mug shot ""speaks volumes,"" considering the charge of resisting without violence. The Dolphins suspended the former University of Utah player indefinitely ""for conduct detrimental to the team,"" according to a news release. ""We were disappointed to learn about Derrick's arrest,"" head coach Joe Philbin said in a statement. ""Based on my conversations with Derrick and the information we have thus far, Derrick will be placed on Indefinite Club Suspension. When we have completed all of the necessary diligence, we will make a final determination on his discipline."" The Dolphins were off this weekend after traveling to London in week four to play the Oakland Raiders. The arrest marks yet more negative publicity for the NFL, which has seen numerous players in recent weeks suspended or placed on voluntary leave after alleged instances of domestic or child abuse. Fort Lauderdale police documents do not elaborate on the allegation that Shelby was touching women at the club, saying only that security alleged he did not have their permission. CNN's Vivian Kuo and Wayne Sterling contributed to this report.","Police: Derrick Shelby asked to leave club after security alleged he was touching women .

""And I'm starting to get pissed off, I'm starting to get hot, because this is our home, he's disrespecting our home, you know? So I said, in the scene with the cameras rolling, 'You're going to clean that (bleep) up.' "" LaBeouf, if anything, was even more hacked off. ""Shia saw it and felt the same -- he's disrespecting our home. So Shia had the same reaction I did and started having some words,"" Pitt said. Tempers finally cooled and later Pitt realized something: Eastwood's action was actually in the script. ""It said Scotty's character is 'chewing tobacco and spitting it on the back of the tank.' He was just doing as instructed in the script! So we were the knobs in the end."" Pitt said he got along well with LaBeouf, who's been in the news recently for his eccentric behavior, including an incident at a Broadway show that led to his arrest and a trip to rehab. ""Oh, I love this boy,"" Pitt said of LaBeouf. ""He's one of the best actors I've ever seen.""","Brad Pitt and Shia LaBeouf thought Scott Eastwood was ""disrespecting"" tank in ""Fury""

"(CNN) -- It's home to a sound system from Jamaica and an elephant slide from Chernobyl. It's where you'll find an outdoor Thai boxing ring, exercise gear from Santa Monica beach, lampposts from the UAE and swing benches from Baghdad. This is Superkilen, an urban park and cycling gateway that sprawls through Norrebro, a bohemian neighborhood of Copenhagen that's become one of the most ethnically diverse parts of Denmark. A far cry from the Copenhagen of the Little Mermaid and traditional waterfront buildings of Nyhavn canal, this willfully eclectic venue might be considered the world's most surreal public space. Stretching along a half-mile-long cycle route, Superkilen is a colorful exercise in community building born from a collaboration between residents and some of Europe's most experimental architects. I start my exploration of Superkilen's three distinctive zones with a slice of Americana. At the top of the zone known as The Green Park stands a 14-meter-tall pole with a giant ""Donut"" and a neon sign. It hails from a restaurant in Pennsylvania and looks like something conjured in a dream by a salivating Homer Simpson. American highway setting . When viewed from a distance, the doughnut sign and shiny logos from the car dealerships across the road create the perfect tableau for an American highway setting. Heading south into the park, I'm greeted by a large cast iron bull, a tribute to the famous Spanish Osborne sherry trademark. Next up is a basketball court that sits in a bowl-shaped concrete structure. The court is modeled on Mogadishu's Lujino Stadium, a venue once used by the militant Al-Shabaab group to launch assaults on Somalia's presidential palace, and which now serves as the training facility for the country's national basketball teams. Then there are all the smaller objects, which I initially walk straight past but which Superkilen's smartphone app guides me to via an interactive map. There are trash cans from the British seaside resort of Blackpool, drains from Switzerland, a manhole cover from Israel and seven different types of bike racks from across Europe. It's a multicultural onslaught. Some of the objects in Superkilen are originals while others are replicas designed so that they comply with Danish regulations for playground materials and public spaces. The items were chosen after canvassing local ideas online and at community meetings. Residents weren't required to pick objects from their place of birth -- some were inspired by treasured vacation spots -- but the idiosyncratic output reflects the diversity of a neighborhood made up of people from 60 nationalities. World expo . Superkilen is a collaboration between the artist group Superflex, Berlin-based landscape architects Topotek1 and Danish architects BIG-Bjarke Ingels Group. Ingels has masterminded some of the most ambitious and left field ideas in Copenhagen, including a public swimming pool in the harbor and a plan to turn an incinerator into a ski slope. ""With Superkilen, we had to find a way of utilizing the diversity in the local population,"" says Nanna Gyldholm Moller of BIG-Bjarke Ingels Group. ""Rather than just have the same Copenhagen bench you will see in any other park, why not involve the local residents to source the best items from across the globe and almost create a world expo?"" A good example stands at the end of the Green Park -- it's a grassy mound with a small patch of naked, reddish soil. The soil comes from different towns of the Palestinian territories and was brought here by two young Copenhagen women who traveled to the Middle East. I stand near the soil and use the smartphone app to watch a film about how the women used their hands, rocks and small plastic bags to gather the material. ""When we travel as Palestinians,"" says one of the the women, Alaa, in the video, ""we gather soil so you can take a piece of Palestine back home to Denmark."" On this breezy morning, a group of schoolkids have gathered on top of the mound on an assignment to plot park objects on a world map as they explore the area. When their teacher gives them the go-ahead, they scamper down a slope covered in zebra-striped asphalt. The stripes lead to the asphalt-covered Black Square, the second part of Superkilen. Local residents were initially irked when they found out grassy areas of the park would be paved over, but the Black Square is the most visually exciting aspect of the project. Judging by the crowds who gather here and take photos, it's also one of the most engaging. Other items here include a Moroccan fountain, chess tables from Bulgaria and a giant plastic octopus from Japan that doubles as a slide. ""The fountain on the Black Square works incredibly because it's star-shaped,"" says Moller. ""When parents are watching their kids play in the water or sliding down the octopus, the parents are seated across from each other, so they end up talking together rather than just sitting in a circle looking away."" Bulls and Thai boxing . The final part of Superkilen is the Red Square, complete with neon signs for a Moscow hotel and a beauty shop in China. It's the most bustling part of Superkilen and takes the park right down to Norrebro's busiest street. Teenage boys play-fight in the Thai boxing ring while daycare children sway on the Baghdad-inspired swing benches. Walls of the adjacent building have been painted red to match the color of the surface, but some the purple-tinted patches on the ground have faded. The area is due to be refurbised next year to enhance the color scheme and to make the surface more slip-resistant for pedestrians and cyclists. Not all of Superkilen is resistant to wear, tear and the effects of time. Some objects, such as the lone steel bull, feel incongruous and random. However, when seen as a whole, this strange bubble of world exposition and local community is a cohesive experience. There have been honors for Superkilen, including a nomination for the prestigious 2013 Mies Van Der Rohe architecture prize. Its real triumph, however, lies in its ability to engage people in its surreal world, whether they're chess players deep in contemplation on the Black Square, moody teenage students having gym lesson at the Santa Monica ""muscle beach"" or toddlers sliding down an octopus from Japan or an elephant from Chernobyl. Lars Hinnerskov Eriksen is a freelance journalist and author based in Copenhagen who writes about all aspects of Nordic culture. He previously spent six years in London working for the Guardian.","Copenhagen urban space is surreal, eclectic mix of objects from all over the world .

"(CNN) -- One bee after you is bad enough. What about thousands? A man in Arizona died after being stung more than an estimated 100 times. An exterminator said based on the size of the hive, there were about 800,000 bees. Douglas Fire Chief Mario Novoa said his department answered a call Wednesday morning and when the crew arrived they found five people stung by bees and the bees still swarming. Deadly giant hornets kill 42 people in China . While some of the emergency responders treated the victims, other firefighters went around the neighborhood warning residents to close their windows and stay inside.

"Washington (CNN) -- Wendy Davis is attacking her partially paralyzed Republican opponent Greg Abbott in the Texas governor's race -- with an ad that features an empty wheelchair. ""A tree fell on Greg Abbott. He sued and got millions. Since then, he's spent his career working against other victims,"" a narrator says of the wheelchair-bound Abbott. The spot is a Hail Mary from the Democratic state senator who is badly trailing in the race. Abbott led Davis 54% to 40% in a recent CBS/New York Times/YouGov poll, and there are few signs she's likely to close that gap before the November 4 election. The ad argues that Abbott successfully sued for his 1984 injury, but later as a Texas Supreme Court justice and state attorney general opposed similar efforts from other people suing hospitals and corporations. ""Abbott argued a woman whose leg was amputated was not disabled because she had an artificial limb,"" the narrator says. ""He ruled against a rape victim who sued a corporation for failing to do a background check on a sexual predator. He sided with a hospital that failed to stop a dangerous surgeon who paralyzed patients."" Abbott's use of a wheelchair has been featured prominently in some of his own ads -- including a biographical spot where he says he rolled up a parking garage's ramps to strengthen his arm after a tree fell on him in 1984, leaving him partially paralyzed. In another, he says, ""a guy in a wheelchair can move faster than traffic on some roads in Texas"" as he touts a transportation funding plan. Abbott spokeswoman Amelia Chasse blasted the Davis ad, saying it ""completely disqualifies"" Davis -- hinting that it could hurt her in future campaigns, too. ""It is challenging to find language strong enough to condemn Sen. Davis' disgusting television ad, which represents a historic low for someone seeking to represent Texans,"" she said. ""Sen. Davis' ad shows a disturbing lack of judgment from a desperate politician, and completely disqualifies her from seeking higher office in Texas.""

"(CNN) -- After sushi and ramen, Japanese beef is on the list of must-eats for many visitors to Japan. But other than knowing that it tastes great and costs a lot, many tourists turn up with little knowledge of what to expect from Japanese beef. Considered the caviar of beef in Japan, Wagyu (which literally means ""Japanese cow"") refers to specific breeds of cattle that come from a direct, traceable and pure bloodline. There are four Wagyu breeds: black (accounting for more than 90% of Wagyu beef), brown/red, shorthorn and polled. In recent years, efficient marketing efforts have elevated Wagyu to near-divine status among foodies. But they've also led to confusion about what Wagyu is and what separates Wagyu beef from the even-more heralded Kobe beef. Here's help for beef eaters visiting Japan. What is Wagyu beef? For more than 200 years during the Edo Period (1603-1867), Japan's isolation from the outside world ensured the purity of its livestock, which over time became more and more homogenized. When the country opened to world trade in the subsequent Meiji Era, Wagyu breeding accelerated. Unlike cattle in other countries, which are often bred for a range of traits, Wagyu were and are raised with one goal in mind: supreme flavor. ""Genetics is everything,"" says Jason Morgan, owner of The Meat Guy, a Nagoya-based meat importing business. Wagyu's striking characteristic is its pervasive marbling. Achieving optimum and evenly distributed fat is a slow process. Wagyu are typically bred for upward of 30 months. By contrast, most United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) beef comes from cattle that's about 22 months old. The fattening period is longer than it is on most Western ranches. Wagyu cows eat plentifully and frequently. Japan's lack of vast pastures means Wagyu tend to live a sedentary life, which also contributes to generous marbling. Wagyu grades . Japan has a sophisticated numbering system for tracing each piece of beef produced. The National Livestock Breeding Center (NLBC) maintains records on each cow's ancestry, birthplace, ranch location, fattening days and other details. Restaurants can usually provide a 10-digit tracking number for any steak upon request, which has a code that links directly to the NLBC database. In addition, the Japan Meat Grading Association gives each carcass a score based on its yield (A-C) and level of marbling, firmness, color and overall quality (1-5), with A5 being the highest possible mark. Most Japanese Wagyu beef is in the A4-A5 range. Wagyu yields and pricing . All the care that goes into raising Wagyu cows translates into consumer prices that are typically higher than in many Western countries. Visitors to Japan should expect to pay anywhere from Â¥5,000 ($46) to upward of Â¥15,000 ($138) per person for a meal of authentic Wagyu beef. At the Oak Door Steakhouse at the Grand Hyatt Tokyo, meat designated F1 (a mix of two pure breeds, such as Wagyu and Angus) is more popular than pure Wagyu beef because it's cheaper yet still yields good quality. ""Eating Wagyu is considered an investment,"" says Troy Lee, chef de cuisine at Oak Door. ""F1 is the most-consumed beef in Japan. ""For most families, Wagyu beef is a delicacy reserved for special occasions."" Wagyu cows have a high yield of prime cuts. ""In the United States, you can only use three of four cuts for steaks, whereas in Japan you can get high-quality beef from nearly all parts of the cow,"" says Morgan. The emphasis is on quality, not quantity. NLBC figures put the total Wagyu population at around 1.7 million cows as of December 2012, compared with roughly 33 million beef cattle in the United States. How to eat Wagyu beef . Most chefs recommend Wagyu steaks be cooked a little longer than those from Western countries -- medium-rare or even medium. Otherwise, ""they can be like eating a stick of butter,"" says Lee. Steaks aren't the only way to enjoy Wagyu. Traditional preparation methods include sukiyaki and shabu-shabu, one-pot dishes that render out more of the fat than grilling. Sukiyaki simmers thinly sliced beef in a pot with vegetables, usually bathed in a sauce made with soy sauce, sugar and sake. A raw egg is served with the dish, used for dipping the beef after it's extracted from the broth. Shabu-shabu is a light and healthy meal made with strips of meat even thinner than those used for sukiyaki. The beef strips are briefly cooked in a simmering kombu kelp broth. Finally, there's beef tartar or ""nigiri Wagyu sushi,"" though this is a relatively rare preparation in Japan. No matter how it's prepared, virtually all restaurants in Japan have a signature dipping sauce or sauces, which often contain miso, sesame or citrus juice. Wagyu beef myth: Fatty means unhealthy . Health-conscious eaters may be wary of the web of fat (called ""shimofuri"") woven through slabs of Wagyu. However, pure Wagyu contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids (aka ""the good fats"") rich in Omega-3s. One study from the Japan Livestock Industry Association says Wagyu has up to 30% more unsaturated fat than Angus cattle. You may have heard about the fifth ""primary taste"" on top of sweet, sour, salty and bitter: umami, a term and concept that originated in Japan, which describes a subtle sweetness and aroma. The presence of unsaturated fats is what makes Wagyu beef so full of umami goodness. Wagyu cows are rarely, if ever, given antibiotics. One of the primary purposes of administering antibiotics, says Morgan, is to make an animal more feed-efficient. This philosophy runs counter to the goal of Wagyu ranching, which is to raise fat, hungry cattle. Myth 2: Japanese cows drink beer and get massages . While it's true that the Matsusaka Cattle Council's website advocates using beer to stimulate a cow's appetite in humid summer months and massages for uniformity of fat and improved circulation, it cites no actual case studies. At best, these techniques may be used sporadically by small-scale farms. Some ranches may use sake to enhance the luster of an animal's coat and Japanese TV programs have depicted ranches with prongs in cattle pens that animals rub up against to simulate a massage. But we remain skeptical. While it's amusing to entertain notions of Wagyu cows happily guzzling beer while receiving rubdowns, there's no evidence to suggest such practices have ever been commonplace. The Kobe Beef Marketing and Distribution Promotion Association states that neither massages nor the feeding of beer or sake to cows is part of its standard rearing methods. ""How's he going to feel a massage through his leather jacket, anyway?"" asks Morgan. Myth 3: Wagyu beef and Kobe beef are the same thing . A common misperception is that all Wagyu beef is Kobe beef. In fact, only .06% of beef consumed in Japan bears the Kobe distinction, and only 3,000 cattle each year are certified as Kobe grade. It wasn't until February 2012 that the first Kobe beef shipment was sent outside Japan -- to Macau. The first (small) export to the United States was in November 2012. Wagyu beef types are named for the region in which the cattle are raised, including, confusingly, Kobe. For the impressive level of marbling in its Wagyu beef, the Kansai region produces the three ""king"" varieties: Matsusaka, Kobe and Ohmi. However, beef from other areas can be equally tasty, says Lee of the Oak Door. Kumamoto Wagyu, for example, comes from the rare Japanese brown breed and is a good choice for those seeking a leaner cut. Although many ranching outfits in Australia and the United States are now raising Wagyu crossbreeds, only four facilities in Japan are certified to export Wagyu beef to the United States. So, the easiest and tastiest place to get authentic Wagyu beef remains Japan. Just one more reason to visit.

"(CNN) -- By early next year, more than 20 chain restaurants will be posting calorie counts on their menus. Yet that information may not be enough to change consumers' behavior, researchers say. According to a new report published in the American Journal of Public Health, the number of calories in a food or beverage item doesn't mean much to many folks. But showing people how much activity they would have to do to burn those calories off might be enough to convince us to ditch our unhealthy habits. Researchers posted different types of signs around six stores in Baltimore. One type of sign posted the number of calories in a regular bottle of soda. Another type posted the amount of sugar in the same bottle. A third type of sign showed either the number of minutes someone would have to run or the number of miles they would have to walk to burn off those 250 extra calories. The scientists recorded all the purchases made by their target study population -- black teenagers from 12 to 18. They also asked some of the adolescents what they thought of the signs as they exited the stores. Soda makers want to cut calories: But is diet really better? Overall, the study author found that providing any calorie information encouraged more teens to purchase water or diet soda instead of a sugar-sweetened beverage. But signs that displayed the physical activity information had a stronger effect than the other types of signs. ""There is a strong scientific link between consumption of sugary beverages and obesity,"" study author Sara Bleich of Johns Hopkins' Bloomberg School of Public Health Department of Health Policy and Management said in a statement. ""Using these easy-to-understand and easy-to-install signs may help promote obesity prevention.""","Showing how much activity is required to burn off a beverage may help change behavior .

"(CNN) -- Actress Amanda Bynes grabbed media attention Friday with a series of tweets about her father, her looks and her mental state. It's the latest bizarre event in what has been a rough couple years for the performer, who was charged with a hit-and-run in 2012, hospitalized for treatment last year after a psychological evaluation and put on probation after a DUI earlier this year. Bynes, 28, has been in the public eye much of her life. Up: She was a child star . She was born in 1986, was raised in Southern California and first rose to fame as one of the stars of Nickelodeon's ""All That,"" a sketch comedy show that also produced Kenan Thompson and Nick Cannon. Bynes, who joined ""All That"" when she was 10, was so popular that she got her own show, ""The Amanda Show,"" by the time she was 13. Before she'd turned 20, she'd co-starred with Frankie Muniz in the 2002 movie ""Big Fat Liar,"" had a leading role in the TV series ""What I Like About You"" and was on the cover of Vanity Fair. She starred in the 2003 film ""What a Girl Wants,"" a modest success. She also was a straight-A high school student, according to an interview in Cosmopolitan. Cannon has remained a friend and has stood up for Bynes throughout her difficulties. ""You're not alone,"" he wrote last year. ""I'm here for you. I understand. I care and I appreciate you, because that's what family does and that's what family is for."" Up: She was on the verge of major movie success . In 2006, Bynes was named one of Teen People's hottest stars under 25, and the next year had her biggest success as Penny Pingleton in the 2007 movie version of the musical ""Hairspray."" She was also one of the stars of the well-reviewed 2010 comedy ""Easy A."" But there was also trouble on the horizon. She signed a deal with a fashion designer to market clothes under the name Dear, but the designer went out of business. She was replaced on one movie. Another, ""Hairspray 2,"" never materialized. In June 2010, she tweeted she was done with acting at 24. ""I've never written the movies & tv shows I've been apart of I've only acted like the characters the producers or directors wanted me to play,"" she wrote. ""Being an actress isn't as fun as it may seem ... I don't love acting anymore so I've stopped doing it."" Down: Her behavior became erratic . Within a month, she'd taken back her announcement. ""I've unretired,"" she tweeted in July, not long before ""Easy A's"" release. However, she hasn't made a movie since. Relationships reportedly came and went with Nick Zano, reality star Doug Reinhardt and (briefly) Seth MacFarlane. Then came the gossip about her own behavior. She was arrested on suspicion of DUI after getting into a fender-bender with police not long after her 26th birthday in April 2012. In August, she was accused of hitting another driver and then driving off. She was charged with two counts of hit-and-run. In February 2014 the DUI charge was dismissed in a plea deal that gave the actress three years on probation, a requirement to attend an alcohol education course and pay a fine after she entered a no-contest plea to reckless driving. Things became stranger. She asked President Obama on Twitter to fire the officer who had arrested her on the DUI charges. Clients at an L.A. gym reported she was acting bizarrely and talking to herself. But, she told People magazine that she was ""doing amazing,"" and planned to move to New York to pursue a career in fashion design. Up: After treatment, new goals . Bynes' social media posts started attracting more attention, whether they were selfies of constantly changing looks or unsettling comments about others. One of her tweets read, ""If I'm not following you on twitter, I hate you."" In May 2013, she was arrested in New York after allegedly tossing drug paraphernalia out of the window of her apartment. In July she was placed under an involuntary psychiatric hold after she was ""involved in a disturbance in a residential neighborhood"" in Thousand Oaks, California. She eventually entered an inpatient psychiatric facility. Yet things seemed to improve after she was released. She moved back in with her parents, who had taken custody of her and had said she was ""making great strides towards recovery"" from mental illness. She hadn't always had a solid relationship with them. In 2012, People reported that she had tried to emancipate herself while working for Nickelodeon, though she never moved out entirely. She continued outpatient treatment this year while going to school. Down: More troubles . In late September, Bynes was arrested on a DUI charge in Sherman Oaks, California. Her arrest report noted a ""disheveled appearance."" On Wednesday in New York she was nabbed by security at a clothing store for suspected shoplifting, though she was let go after signing a ""no-trespass agreement,"" TMZ reported. She also threatened to sue InTouch magazine for writing ""lies about me."" Then came Friday's tweets. First, a series of comments were posted to Bynes' official account that day alleging the star's father was verbally, physically and sexually abusive. But within a few hours, another tweet was posted claiming that the allegations were false. Due to the sensitive nature of the tweets, which haven't been confirmed to have been posted by Bynes herself, we're refraining from sharing them here. CNN has reached out to Bynes' parents and Bynes' lawyer, and hasn't yet received a response. CNN's Alan Duke, Jane Caffrey and Breeanna Hare contributed to this story.","Amanda Bynes posted a series of strange tweets Friday .

Cuban government officials have previously criticized international companies' efforts to capitalize on Guevara's famous visage, which has been used to market everything from rock bands to luxury automobiles. Chavez was a key ally to the Cuban government, supplying the island with millions of barrels of oil and adopting a brand of socialism similar to the Cuban revolution's in his native Venezuela.

"(CNN) -- As the death of the first patient diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. sparks more fears, airports are beefing up screening for people from affected nations. With developments pouring in from all corners of the world, here's what you need to know to quickly get caught up on the latest: . WEST AFRICA . No relief in sight: . The world's largest outbreak of Ebola has killed more than 3,800 people, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. The numbers reflect confirmed Ebola cases in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and the United States, the WHO said. The virus is affecting medical workers. A United Nations official is being treated in Liberia after contracting Ebola. The unnamed worker is the second U.N. member infected with the virus in Liberia. The first one died last month. A possible $32 billion hit: . The outbreak could cost the African economy $32 billion over the next two years if it spreads to its larger neighbors, the World Bank estimates. The steps some countries have taken to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus amount to ""putting a towel under the door of a building on fire,"" World Bank president Jim Kim told CNN's Richard Quest on Thursday. Complete coverage on Ebola . Liberia postpones election: . Liberia's President on Thursday postponed a senatorial election that had been set for next week, citing the Ebola outbreak in the country. The nation's election commission had recommended the delay, saying that the prevalence of the virus, authorities' efforts to combat it and citizens' efforts to isolate themselves weren't conducive to a free and open election. Officials have not yet revealed any new date for the election, which had been set for Tuesday. U.S. troops arrive in Liberia: . A group of 90 U.S. Marines and airmen arrived in Liberia on Thursday to help Ebola response efforts, along with four V-22 Osprey aircraft and two C-130 transport planes. Their arrival brings the total number of U.S. troops deployed in Liberia to 334, military spokesman Lt. Col. Dave Doherty said. And there are more coming. In late October, 700 troops from the 101st Airborne Division are scheduled to deploy to Liberia. Liberian leader a 'bit more confident': . Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf on Thursday acknowledged the human and economic toll that Ebola has taken on her country since beginning in March and during the ensuing intensifying weeks, before adding, ""We are a bit more confident (now) that our collective response will turn the curve away from the dire projections."" Sirleaf outlined several steps to overcome the crisis. They include a ""more timely and decisive response"" to the Ebola crisis, including new testing, treatment and burying centers;"" improving the nation's normal health care system; and bolstering the economy overall, including through infrastructure and other projects. U.S. CASES . Thomas Duncan dies: . Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, died Wednesday, 10 days after he was admitted to Dallas' Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. His family wonders whether the outcome would have been different if doctors had admitted Duncan to a hospital on September 25, the first time he showed up with a fever and stomach pain. Duncan's family has criticized the care he received. The Dallas hospital that treated him says staff members did everything they could. Ebola test negative for Dallas deputy: . An Ebola test was negative for a Dallas deputy who was hospitalized with possible symptoms of the deadly virus, officials said. The deputy, Sgt. Michael Monnig, didn't have any direct contact with Duncan but had reported contact with Duncan's family. Physicians at Texas Health Presbyterian discharged him Thursday, soon after the negative test came back, hospital spokeswoman Candace White said. New travel screening: . Five of America's biggest, busiest airports are beefing up measures. Now, people arriving from the three nations hardest hit by Ebola will get special screening, including having their temperature taken. The airports are: New York's JFK, Washington Dulles, Newark, Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta international airports. IN OTHER COUNTRIES . Spain ramps up response: . After a nurse's assistant in Spain became the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa, five people related to the case were being monitored in a Madrid hospital, including her husband, an emergency room doctor and the neighborhood doctor who saw her before the case was confirmed. 'Save Excalibur' fails: . Despite a public push to save its life, Excalibur -- the Spanish nurse assistant's dog -- was euthanized because of concern it may have become infected with Ebola. Critics said the dog should have been quarantined, just like the assistant's husband has been. Sporadic infections unavoidable, the WHO says: . Sporadic Ebola infections will be unavoidable in some European countries because of direct travel from their hubs to hotspot areas in West Africa, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. But the risk of spread, it said, is avoidable and extremely low. Australia scare: . A 57-year-old woman who returned to Australia after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone has been isolated at a hospital and is undergoing tests, including one for the deadly virus, authorities said. She had isolated herself at home and checked her temperature twice daily since her return, as recommended by national guidelines. The Queensland Department of Health announced early Friday that initial tests on the woman came back negative for Ebola. United Kingdom: . The UK's Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar railway terminals will begin screening passengers arriving from Ebola-affected Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, a government spokesman said. Screening will involve assessing passengers' recent travel history, who they have been in contact with and future travel arrangements, as well as a possible assessment performed by medical personnel. Macedonia: . A Macedonian hotel has closed after a person staying there died two hours after being taken to a hospital, the country's health ministry announced Thursday. The patient did not live in one of the West African countries most affected by Ebola, nor did he have a high temperature that's symptomatic of the virus. Still, even though there's a ""rather high chance"" this person did not have Ebola, ""we are undertaking all the necessary measures"" just in case, according to the health ministry. That includes not only shutting down the hotel, but also quarantining those who were in the same hotel, as well as medical staff who had direct contact with the patient. Dominican Republic: . Dominican authorities met US Airways Flight 845 on Wednesday after it landed in Punta Cana from Philadelphia ""due to a possible health issue on board,"" airline spokeswoman Michelle Mohr said. ""Strictly adhering to all CDC guidelines for airlines in response to the Ebola virus,"" officials checked and eventually cleared the plane, according to Mohr.

"(CNN) -- Carrie Johnson is representing the United States at the 2012 Olympics in pursuit of the gold medal in women's kayaking. But while she battles for the gold, Johnson is fighting another battle: with Crohn's disease, one of the two most common inflammatory bowel diseases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In a recent SI.com interview, Johnson talked openly about her illness. One of the first things she did after being diagnosed in 2003, she said, was ""take to the Internet and library to read about the disease."" She had to -- like many people, she had heard of Crohn's disease but had little understanding of it. More than 1 million people currently suffer from Crohn's disease, and thousands more are diagnosed each year. However, many suffer in silence, as the effects of Crohn's are often not openly discussed. About seven of every 100,000 people in the United States are diagnosed, most of them between the ages of 15 and 30, according to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. There is no cure for the chronic condition. Crohn's disease is named after Dr. Burrill Crohn who, along with two colleagues, recognized and documented the symptoms in 1932. Those diagnosed with it include some well-known personalities such as former President Dwight D. Eisenhower; Mike McCready, guitarist for Pearl Jam; former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley; and actress Shannen Doherty. Crohn's disease is an autoimmune disease of the digestive tract that most often affects the small or large intestines, and sometimes both. According to the CDC, Crohn's is ""a condition of chronic inflammation potentially involving any location of the gastrointestinal tract, but it frequently affects the end of the small bowel and the beginning of the large bowel. In Crohn's disease, all layers of the intestine may be involved and there can be normal healthy bowel between patches of diseased bowel."" In a healthy body, the immune system creates an infection-fighting protein called tumor necrosis factor. When Crohn's disease is present, TNF is produced in excess as the immune system mistakenly identifies healthy bacteria as a foreign presence. This causes the body to launch an attack and begin fighting the excess TNF, which leads to more inflammation, which results in more TNF. As this internal battle takes place, it causes severe pain, abdominal swelling, cramping, bleeding, diarrhea and deterioration of the affected portion of the intestinal tract. Dr. Dennis Choat, a board-certified colon and rectal surgeon with the Georgia Colon and Rectal Surgical Associates, is all too familiar with the effects of Crohn's on patients. ""Crohn's is a chronic, lifelong disease for which there is no cure,"" he said. ""Because its cause is unknown, and because flare-ups happen without warning, those diagnosed with Crohn's face a life of challenges and uncertainties. ""For some, treatment will bring about favorable results. For others, treatment will have little or no effect. Each patient is different, and treatment is a trial-and-error process. The only certainty is that it is a lifelong battle."" The cause of Crohn's is not known, but the National Institutes of Health notes that it can run in families and have a genetic component. Unknown triggers can also be caused by the environment. Early treatments for Crohn's disease primarily centered on steroid drugs such as prednisone, which relieved the inflammation but did little more. In recent years, there has been significant success in treating symptoms, and in some cases bringing about remission, with the use of newer anti-TNF drugs such as Remicade, Humira and Cimzia. However, they too have their own set of complications and side effects. The man who couldn't eat . A diagnosis of Crohn's disease often brings more questions than answers, and patients can face a long list of ever-changing complications. In addition to pain, bleeding and bowel changes, they have difficulty absorbing nutrition and often deal with malnourishment, anemia and crippling fatigue. Left untreated, Crohn's spreads throughout the intestinal tract, causing more severe symptoms and a bleaker prognosis. The disease itself is not classified as a terminal illness, but the complications that arise from it can sometimes be life-threatening. Crohn's patients face another stark reality: In spite of their and their doctor's best efforts, the disease can stop responding to medication. When that happens, surgery becomes a last resort. According to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America, about 70% of Crohn's sufferers eventually require surgery. About 30% of patients who have surgery for Crohn's disease experience a recurrence of their symptoms within three years, and up to 60% will have a recurrence within 10 years. The two most common surgeries for Crohn's disease are bowel resection surgery, which involves removal of the deteriorated portion of intestine, and fistula repair surgery. Fistulas can result from Crohn's disease permeating the intestinal wall, leaving an opening or ""hole"" in the intestinal tract. This is one of the most serious complications of Crohn's. Developing infection during the healing process is not uncommon, and often leads to temporary ostomies and lengthy periods of intravenous feeding. Could I have inflammatory bowel disease? Crohn's will always bring about a change in the quality of life, but recent studies are painting a picture for a more hopeful future. Medical research funding is critical, and raising funds presents a challenge in the current economic environment. ""It's not a matter of if we find cures; it's a matter of when, and that's determined by available funding,"" said Richard Geswell, president of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America. The foundation is the largest voluntary nonprofit health organization dedicated to finding cures for inflammatory bowel diseases, a classification that includes Crohn's and colitis. It is one source of funding for studies across the country and has chapters nationwide. The foundation's website allows patients to become part of online study groups by sharing their symptoms, progress and complications. This allows the patient to develop an understanding of his or her individual case, and allows the foundation to have access to more patient histories for use in its research.

"Paris, France (CNN) -- The French Senate approved Tuesday a law banning any veils that cover the face -- including the burqa, the full-body covering worn by some Muslim women -- making France the first European country to plan such a measure. The law passed by a vote of 246 to 1, with about 100 abstentions coming essentially from left-leaning politicians. The legislation was overwhelmingly approved by the lower house of parliament in July and will go into effect next spring. French people back the ban by a margin of more than four to one, the Pew Global Attitudes Project found in a survey earlier this year. Some 82 percent of people polled approved of a ban, while 17 percent disapproved. That was the widest support the Washington-based think tank found in any of the five countries it surveyed. Clear majorities also backed burqa bans in Germany, Britain and Spain, while two out of three Americans opposed it, the survey found. A panel of French lawmakers recommended a ban last year, and lawmakers unanimously passed a non-binding resolution in May calling the full-face veil contrary to the laws of the nation. ""Given the damage it produces on those rules which allow the life in community, ensure the dignity of the person and equality between sexes, this practice, even if it is voluntary, cannot be tolerated in any public place,"" the French government said when it sent the measure to parliament in May. The law imposes a fine of 150 euros ($190) and/or a citizenship course as punishment for wearing a face-covering veil. Forcing a woman to wear a niqab or a burqa will be punishable by a year in prison or a 15,000-euro ($19,000) fine, the government said, calling it ""a new form of enslavement that the republic cannot accept on its soil."" The French Council of State has warned that the ban could be incompatible with international human rights laws and the country's own constitution. The council advises on laws, but the government is not required to follow its recommendations. The ban pertains to the burqa, a full-body covering that includes a mesh over the face, and the niqab, a full-face veil that leaves an opening only for the eyes. The hijab, which covers the hair and neck but not the face, and the chador, which covers the body but not the face, apparently are not banned by the law. However, a 2004 law in France bans the wearing or displaying of overt religious symbols in schools -- including the wearing of headscarves by schoolgirls. The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life estimates that France has about 3.5 million Muslims, or about 6 percent of the population. France does not keep its own statistics on religious affiliation of the population, in keeping with its laws requiring the state to be strictly secular. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","NEW: The law will go into effect next spring and impose a fine of $190 for violations .

"(CNN) -- I am a woman with chronic schizophrenia. I have spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals. I could have ended up living most of my life on a back ward, but things turned out quite differently. In fact, I've managed to stay free of hospitals for almost 30 years. This is perhaps my proudest accomplishment. That doesn't mean that I have been free of all psychiatric struggles. For example, on my analyst's announcing his planned retirement, I fell apart. My best friend, Steve Behnke, sensed that something was terribly wrong, and he came to New Haven, Connecticut, to see me. Quoting from some writings of mine: . ""I opened the door of my studio apartment. Steve would later tell me that for all the times he had seen me psychotic, what he saw that afternoon shocked him. For a week or more I had barely eaten. I was gaunt, and moved as though my legs were wooden. My face looked (and felt) like a mask. I'd pulled down all the shades, so the apartment was in near total darkness, the air fetid, the place a shambles. Steve, a lawyer and psychologist, has worked with many patients who suffer from severe mental illness. To this day he'll tell me that on that afternoon I looked as bad as any he'd ever seen. ""'Hi,' I said, then returned to the couch, where I was silent for several minutes. 'Thank you for coming, Steve,' I finally said. 'Crumbling world. Word. Voice. Tell the clocks to stop. Time is time has come.' ... 'I'm being pushed into a grave, the situation is grave,' I moaned. 'Gravity is pulling me down. Tell them to get away. I'm scared. I'm scared.'"" Watch Elyn Saks' TED Talk . *** . As a young woman, I was in psychiatric hospitals for three lengthy stays. Despite my diagnosis with schizophrenia and my ""grave prognosis"" -- that I would live in a board and care facility and work at a menial job at best -- I am a chaired professor of law at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, with a beloved husband, Will, and many good friends. I'd like to tell you how that happened and describe my experience of being psychotic. I qualify that by saying my experience, because everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way. One Friday night on the roof of the Yale Law School library I scared my classmates with a full-blown psychotic episode. Quoting from my writings: . ""The next morning, I went to my professor's office to ask for an extension, and began gibbering unintelligibly as I had the night before. He eventually brought me to the Emergency Room. ""Someone I'll call just 'The Doctor,' and his whole team of goons swooped down, grabbed me, lifted me out of the chair and slammed me down on a nearby bed with such force that I saw stars. Then they bound both my legs and arms to the metal bed, with thick leather straps. ""A sound came out of my mouth that I'd never heard before. Half-groan, half-scream, barely human, and pure terror. Then the sound came again, forced from somewhere deep inside my belly and scraping my throat raw."" TED.com: Sherwin Nuland on how electroshock therapy changed him . This incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization. One reason the doctors gave for holding me against my will was that I was gravely disabled. Supporting this view, they wrote in my chart that I was not able to do my Yale Law School homework. I wonder what that meant for most of the rest of New Haven. During the next year, I would spend five months in psychiatric hospitals on the East Coast. At times, I spent up to 20 hours a day in restraints -- hands tied, hands and feet tied down, hands and feet tied down with a net tied tightly across my chest. I never struck anyone, I never harmed anyone, I never made any direct threats to anyone. I was lucky I wasn't one of the one to three people who die in restraints each week. Today, I am pro-psychiatry and anti-force. I don't think force is effective as a treatment. And I think using force is a terrible thing to do to another human being with a terrible illness. *** . Everything about my illness says that I shouldn't be here. But I am. And I am, I think, for three reasons. First, I've had excellent treatment, both psychoanalytic psychotherapy and medication. Second, I have many family members and close friends who know me and who know my illness. Third, USC Law School is an enormously supportive workplace which has been able not just to accommodate my needs, but to embrace my needs. Even with all of that -- excellent treatment, wonderful friends and family, enormously supportive work environment -- I did not make my illness public until relatively late in my life. And that's because the stigma against mental illness is so powerful that I didn't feel safe with people knowing. If you hear nothing else today, please hear that there are not schizophrenics, there are people with schizophrenia. And each of these people may be a parent, may be your sibling, may be your neighbor, may be your colleague. TED.com: Jill Bolte Taylor's stroke of insight . *** . I often get asked the ""magic pill"" question: Would I take a pill that would instantly cure me? The answer is a fast and emphatic ""yes."" That said, I don't wish to be seen as regretting the life I could have had if I'd not been ill. Nor am I asking anyone for their pity. What I rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share is more important than the mental illness we may not.

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- I wish I were surprised that Texas Gov. Rick Perry doesn't see a problem with concealed weapons in schools, but after watching his failed bid for the presidency, the truth is there's very little that man can say that will truly surprise me. ""If you have been duly back-grounded and trained and you are a concealed handgun license-carrying individual, you should be able to carry your handgun anywhere in this state,"" Perry said at a tea party event held on Monday. It seems his line of reasoning is in line with some of his gun-loving brethren who believe if teachers and principals are armed, tragedies like the one in Newtown would go away. It's as if he thinks ""Rambo"" is a documentary. In a country with fewer than 350 million people but more than 310 million guns, we don't need more of them. We need fewer. And when it comes to our schools, we don't need guns at all. So it's very fortunate that Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder had the good sense to veto Michigan Senate Bill 59 on Tuesday. The proposed law would have allowed people with permits to carry concealed weapons and with extra training, to bring their guns to traditional ""gun-free"" zones such as day care centers and schools. And by ""extra training,"" the bill called for an additional eight hours and another 94 rounds on the firing range. That's it. It was approved the day before the shootings in Newtown. On Monday -- while Perry was encouraging guns in schools -- a letter signed by all 21 superintendents in my county was sent to Gov. Snyder asking him to veto the bill because, unlike the gun-happy politicians who rammed the legislation through in a lame duck session, educators do not believe guns in schools are a good thing. I have yet to hear a teacher who has survived a massacre advocate for guns in schools. In fact, the American Federation of Teachers -- with its 1.5 million members -- also sent a letter to Snyder opposing the bill, saying, ""We should be doing everything we can to reduce the possibility of any gunfire in schools and concentrate on ways to keep all guns off school property."" In moments of stress, typically the first thing to erode is our motor skills. So the argument that educators should be ready to dodge gunfire, avoid hitting students and take out a gunman so someone hundreds of miles away can buy military-grade weapons and ammunition for kicks is a very stupid argument to make. And yet, we heard elements of that reasoning soon after the movie theater killings in Aurora, Colorado. Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert asked: ""It does make me wonder, with all those people in the theater, was there nobody that was carrying a gun that could have stopped this guy more quickly?"" Yes, Gohmert -- because what a dark room filled with tear gas and panicked people needs is more guns. That makes as much sense as the lawmakers in Florida allowing concealed weapons in the state Capitol building in Tallahassee -- and then needing to install alert buttons on the phones of every senator and staffer in case someone came in and started shooting up the place with one of those concealed weapons. Gov. Snyder needed to veto SB 59, not because the mood of the country has shifted because of the Newtown tragedy, but because it was bad legislation to begin with. We don't need -- and most educators don't want -- guns in schools. I said most because David Thweatt, superintendent of the Harrold school district in Texas, where employees have been allowed to carry guns in schools since 2008, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram: ""Nothing is 100%. But what we do know is that we've done all we can to protect our children."" Also, on ""Meet the Press,"" former Secretary of Education William Bennett said, ""I'm not so sure I wouldn't want one person in a school armed, ready for this kind of thing. ... It has to be someone who's trained, responsible. But, my God, if you can prevent this kind of thing, I think you ought to."" Bennett: The case for gun rights is stronger than you think . Let's think about this: In August, nine bystanders in New York were wounded as a result of police gunfire -- the police were trying to arrest a suspect connected with another shooting. In September, police in Houston shot and killed a double amputee in a wheelchair who was trying to stab an officer -- with a pen. Back in 2009, in Perry's state of Texas, a military doctor opened fire at the Fort Hood Army post, killing 13 and wounding 30 others. The victims were all professionals, surrounded by guns, and trained to handle -- in Bennett's words -- ""this kind of thing."" Why would anyone think teachers and principals could take a couple of weekend classes and do better than them? It just doesn't make sense. Having police patrol the area during school hours is fine. But allowing guns in school is simply counterintuitive to the kind of civilized society we want to live in and represent to the rest of the world. Did you know, in addition to schools and day care centers, SB 59 would've allowed guns in hospitals, stadiums and churches? I'm not anti-gun -- I have one in my house. But I ask you: What kind of people feel the need to have a gun with them in church? I'll tell you what kind: The kind who probably shouldn't have one in the first place.

"New York (CNN) -- Hip-hop artist Rick Ross learned Thursday he'd been dumped by the sportswear company Reebok after the company decided he hadn't shown an ""appropriate level of remorse"" for using lyrics in one of his songs that seemed to allude to raping a woman. In the song ""U.O.E.N.O,"" Ross raps: ""Put molly all in her champagne, she ain't even know it. I took her home and I enjoyed that, she ain't even know it."" The drug mentioned in Ross' song is ""molly,"" which is a slang term for a powerful form of the psychoactive drug MDMA, commonly called ecstasy. His lyrics sparked outrage from fans and activist groups. Reebok released a statement on Thursday announcing it had severed ties with Ross. ""Reebok holds our partners to a high standard, and we expect them to live up to the values of our brand,"" the statement read. ""Unfortunately, Rick Ross has failed to do so.

"(CNN) -- She's looking over the boat's edge to spot a dolphin and record its markings. He's digging for medieval tools in the fields around an abandoned friary. Or they're simply hearing their native language spoken a bit differently in a different country, where the food doesn't quite taste the same. Travel can introduce kids to the world's real-life wonders, changing their perspective on topics they may have only read about in books. It can literally change their lives. ""There is a kid's way of seeing the world,"" says Keith Bellows, editor-in-chief of National Geographic Traveler magazine and author of National Geographic's ""100 Places That Can Change Your Child's Life."" ""As an adult, get out of the way, and stop marching them through an experience. When you get them to slow down and experience a place from their perspective, it's magic. Not just the place itself, but the experience."" Consider Bellows' suggestions a step up from simply taking a vacation. He says these places could open your child's eyes to the diversity of the world, help them learn what interests them and inform how they navigate it as adults. Marco Island, Florida . Of course Walt Disney World is a Florida rite of passage for many children (and their parents) but there's so much to the state that isn't prefabricated. Marco Island is one of those places for Bellows, with beaches showing off the rusticity and charm of old Florida. Kids will love the beach and you can sneak in some science in the spectacular nature surrounding you. To Disney or not to Disney? Get on board the Dolphin Explorer with your children and turn them into citizen scientists. Capt. Chris Desmond, founder of the 10,000 Islands Dolphins Project, directs children to note the family compositions, behavior and even evidence of shark bites of the dolphins they spot. They give the data to adult biologists onboard who feed it into a computer. The bonus: If a child spots a new dolphin -- most are already known to the crew -- that child gets to name the dolphin. ""Every kid wants to spot a newcomer and it happened on a trip I was on,"" says Bellows. Big Sur, California . The drive from San Francisco into Big Sur may be Bellows' favorite drive in the world. ""It is one of the most hair-raising drives in the world, and you get the sense of a wild, driving adventure,"" he says. ""I've done it at least 40 or 50 times, and I never get tired of it."" He recommends renting a convertible and coming down from San Francisco through the agriculture fields onto the California coast, much of which is protected and can be explored along the way. One highlight: Point Lobos State Natural Reserve, just north of Big Sur. ""It really teaches children that if you really love an area, you can protect it. Most of that coastline is protected, and it shows you what happens when you don't screw it up. "" Grand Canyon . Nothing makes Bellows feel more humble than standing on the lip of the Grand Canyon, even if he's standing with thousands of other people. ""It's a bite out of the Earth, a thrilling glimpse into the inside of the Earth,"" he says. Top U.S. spots for family fun . When children see the canyon layers below, that's the first step in their understanding of the geology of the Earth, says Bellows. Take an age-appropriate hike so your children can see the layers and wildlife that make up the canyon. ""They can see we didn't just spring from nothing. This is a wafer sandwich of the world, and we're going to be one of the layers one day."" Chesapeake Bay, Maryland . The nation's largest estuary, the Chesapeake Bay is filled with 64,000 square miles of rivers, marshes and bays. ""My kids have grown up there kneeling in grass, looking for tadpoles and pulling up crab pots ... and I love it,"" says Bellows. ""It's some of the wildest primitive country we have. You can watch the ebb and flow of oysters, crabs and fishes, and it tells you how you're treating this incredible place."" It's the home of the wild ponies children have read about it in Marguerite Henry's ""Misty of Chincoteague."" Those ponies of Assateague Island National Seashore live in two herds. You can see the ponies at the park but don't feed them (to keep them wild). Library of Congress, Washington . It's OK to tell your children that the movie ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" was filmed at the Library of Congress. (Heck, show them the movie in advance of your trip.) And yes, that it's the biggest library in the world with 3,800 staff, 500 miles of shelving and 128 million items (with about 10,000 items added each day). 7 tips for cherry blossom fun in D.C. ""If you go into the Library of Congress, you're going to tell them it's a library but it's also a treasure trove,"" says Bellows. Whatever your child likes, whether it's music or maps or sports or humor, it's likely he or she can find something about it here. Your children also can get a ""Passport to Knowledge"" to guide them to the library's so-called greatest hits, and they can play at Knowledge Quest kiosks and bookmark places of interest to explore later on a personalized mini-site. New York City . A visit to New York for every child who has not grown up there is also a rite of passage, says Bellows. ""Every kid has to go to New York City, and every adult does, too,"" he says. ""Every time you go back and haven't been there for awhile, it's a new place. It's so big and so fast."" Take the Circle Line boat tour, he suggests, so you can see by sailing around it how small an island Manhattan actually is. You can notice how connected it is to the other islands of Staten Island and Long Island (where Brooklyn and Queens are) and the Bronx, which is actually on the U.S mainland. ""Here's an island in the middle of nowhere but it's connected to the entire world."" For children seeing the Statue of Liberty, a Broadway show or the city decorated at Christmas for the first time, ""it gets imprinted on kids' minds."" London . London is a starter city for U.S. parents who want to take their kids out of the country, after you've explored the nearest metropolitan city and your national parks. ""They speak English in London but a child will know just how foreign it is, with things like Marmite,"" says Bellows. ""The wonderful thing about it is, this is a little like Harry Potter world. It's familiar enough to be safe and foreign enough to be thrilling."" Older children will love the ghoulish (and true) tales of the Tower of London. Begun in the 1070s by William the Conqueror, the tower was Europe's first fortress. Queen Anne Boleyn was beheaded there in 1536 and is rumored to still haunt the place. Trim, Ireland . How could medieval warriors run in chain mail armor? How heavy is a stone ax, really? Head to the ruins of the Dominican Black Friary, a short distance from Trim Castle in the town of Trim, Ireland. Once a home for religious men and women, the friary's ruins are being excavated in a special way. Visitors can get a crash course in excavation and start digging and recording their findings side-by-side with archaeologists and geologists. Younger children get to play at a camp, where they get to pick up heavy stone axes and run in chain mail. Older children will enjoy a tour of nearby Trim Castle, which starred in the movie ""Braveheart."" Hugh de Lacy and his son Walter began construction of the castle, the largest Anglo-Norman castle in Ireland, in the 1170s. The castle protected the medieval village, once a commercial and religious powerhouse. ""What amazing architects these people were, and how remarkably old this is,"" says Bellows. ""It's the quintessential castle. It's knights, bow and arrows and blood on the ground."" Muskoka, Canada . Bellows grew up in Muskoka, two hours north of Toronto in Ontario's cottage country. ""This is where kids can really connect with wilderness, even more so than the Chesapeake,"" he says. ""There are dark lakes and loons at night. You can come out to a fish, flip the canoes and find the air holes underneath.""

People who want to visit the Galapagos Islands have to take approved tours, designed to protect the islands' fragile ecology.

You see two birds who look the same but they have different vocalizations. It's like two people speaking English but one person is from Brooklyn and the other is from Boston."" The animals have no fear of humans, so your children will swim with dolphins and turtles and play near seals. But it's not all peaceful. ""I saw a seal attacked by a shark and dying, tortoises leaning into each other, both dead,"" he says. ""You're on a beach and you see crabs hatch prematurely in the middle of the day, slowly breaking down. It's Darwin's theory of evolution and the survival of the fittest.""

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid and Portugal footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has revealed he has become a father for the first time with a mystery woman. The striker, who captained his country recently during a disappointing World Cup campaign in South Africa, announced the surprise news on Twitter and said he planned to raise the baby boy himself. According to media reports, the mother is an unnamed American woman he is no longer with. Ronaldo spent much of last summer in Los Angeles ahead of his $100 million transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid. A statement released on the star's Facebook page Sunday said: ""It is with great joy and emotion that I inform I have recently become father to a baby boy. ""As agreed with the baby's mother, who prefers to have her identity kept confidential, my son will be under my exclusive guardianship. ""No further information will be provided on this subject and I request everyone to fully respect my right to privacy (and that of the child) at least on issues as personal as these are."" According to Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manha, Ronaldo's mother and his sisters are dealing with the paperwork necessary to bring the child to the family home in Portugal. Joao Carvalho, a journalist with Portugal's TVI network, told CNN the news of Ronaldo's baby had provoked a mixed reaction in a country where he is regarded as a superstar. ""On one hand, people are unhappy with how he has handled the situation from a PR standpoint,"" he said. ""But on the other hand they think having a baby might be beneficial for him, as it will make him more mature and give him some personal stability."" CNN's Felipe Araujo contributed to this report.","Cristiano Ronaldo reveals he is a father via his Twitter, Facebook accounts .

"(CNN) -- A state trial judge on Monday blocked New York City's plan for a maximum 16 ounce size for a high-sugar beverage. The ban would have included sodas, energy drinks, fruit drinks and sweetened teas. But it would have excluded alcoholic beverages and drinks that are more than 50% milk, such as lattes. The ban would have applied to restaurants, movie theaters, stadiums and mobile food carts. But it would not have applied to supermarkets and convenience stores, such as 7-Eleven. Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposal was met with fierce opposition by the industry and public outrage at the loss of ""liberty,"" the so-called ""nanny state"" run amok. Beyond all the hype, the industry's vociferous arguments, now adopted by a trial court, are badly flawed. In fact, the Board of Health has the power, indeed the responsibility, to regulate sugary drinks for the sake of city residents, particularly the poor. News: Mississippi governor reviews 'Anti-Bloomberg' bill . Would the ban work? Nearly six out of 10 New York City residents are overweight or obese, as are nearly four out of 10 schoolchildren. This cannot be acceptable to our society, knowing that obesity is such a powerful risk factor for diabetes, cancer and heart disease. No one would disagree that government should act, but how? There is no single solution, but many ideas that would work in combination. One of those solutions is to control portion size and sugar consumption. Why? First, the ever-expanding portions (think ""supersized"") are one of the major causes of obesity. When portion sizes are smaller, individuals eat less but feel full. This works, even if a person can take an additional portion. (Most won't because they are satiated, and it at least makes them think about what they are consuming.) Second, sugar is high in calories, promotes fat storage in the body and is addictive, so people want more. The so-called ""war on sugar"" is not a culture war, it is a public health imperative backed by science. Opposing view: 'Anti-Bloomberg' bill stops overregulation . So, there is good reason to believe New York's portion control would work. But why does the city have to prove that it works beyond any doubt? Those who cry ""nanny state"" in response to almost any modern public health measure (think food, alcohol, firearms, distracted driving) demand a standard of proof that lawmakers don't have to meet in any other field. When a law is passed to increase jobs, spur the economy or subsidize a corporate sector (oil, for example), we don't insist that lawmakers prove it works. At least public health officials rely on science and try to craft rules that have a chance of workingâ€”if not in isolation, then in combination with other obesity control measures such as food labeling, calorie disclosures, trans fat restrictions and access to affordable fruits and vegetables in schools and poor neighborhoods. Is the ban consistent? The industry stoked the fires of public discontent with its campaign against the ""inconsistencies"" in the soda ban. Why doesn't the ban apply to milky drinks, why can 7-Eleven sell large sugary drinks, and why not ban refills? Justice Milton Tingling Jr. bought both industry arguments: It won't work and it is inconsistent. He went so far as to call the ban ""fraught with arbitrary and capricious consequences"" and filled with loopholes. Again, we find a double standard. Bloomberg did what every other politician does: balance public health and safety with realpolitik. Consider one of the judge's major arguments: balancing public health and economic considerations is ""impermissible."" This judicial reasoning makes no sense. If policy makers could not balance economic consequences, virtually every law in America would be flawed. There is another huge problem with this argument. It assumes that unless public health does everything, it can do nothing. The whole art of politics is compromise. The mayor gets a lot of what he seeks to fight obesity, but not everything. Does the Board of Health have the power? Admittedly, the soda ban would have been better coming from the city's elected legislature, the City Council. But the Board of Health has authority to act in cases where there is an imminent threat to health. Doesn't the epidemic of obesity count as an imminent threat, with its devastating impact on health, quality of life and mortality? In any event, the Board of Health has authority over the food supply and chronic disease, which is exactly what it has used in this case. Members of the Board of Health, moreover, are experts in public health, entitled to a degree of deference. The fact that the proposal originated in the mayor's office does not diminish the board's authority and duty to protect the public's health. Many health proposals arise from the executive branch, notably the Affordable Care Act. Should industry have an outsized influence on public health policy? The fingerprints of the food and restaurant industries, with their clear economic conflicts of interest, are all over the public and judicial campaign to block the soda ban. Industry undertook a multimillion-dollar campaign, flying banners over the city and plastering ads over the subways. They immediately filed suit and hired the most elite law firms. Rather than recognize the public health effects of large sugary drinks, they chose to fight, reminiscent of Big Tobacco. What is worse, the public (and now a judge) fell for the industry's manipulations. Most New Yorkers oppose the portion ban, while politicians in other states are scrambling to show their disapproval. Mississippi is about to pass a law forbidding portion control. Imagine that in a state with the highest obesity rate in America! We are used to fierce lobbying for personal gain in America, but that doesn't mean we should be duped by industry propaganda. Is a portion limit really such an assault on freedom? It doesn't stop anyone from buying soda. If consumers really want, they can buy several smaller drinks. It doesn't stop companies from giving refills. There is really no great burden posed on individuals, only a little nudge in the right direction. At the same time, it could make meaningful changes in the drinking habits of New Yorkers. Why is the industry fighting this so fiercely? Because when it is shown to be successful in New York, it will be emulated in major cities in America and worldwide. Isn't that exactly what we need to stem the tide of obesity? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lawrence O. Gostin.","A New York state judge blocks the city's plan to limit the size of sugary drinks .

"(CNN) -- Celine Dion is putting her music career on hold indefinitely because of her husband's cancer and her own illness, the singer announced Wednesday. Dion's Las Vegas residency shows and plans to tour Asia in the fall have been taken off her schedule, according to a statement posted on her website and social media accounts. Dion, 46, must ""focus 100% of her attention on her husband Rene, their family, and associated health issues,"" the statement said. Rene Angelil, 72, underwent surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from his throat last December. He stepped aside as his wife's manager in June because of the illness. ""It's been a very difficult and stressful time for the couple as they deal with the day-to-day challenges of fighting this disease while trying to juggle a very active show business schedule, and raise their three young children,"" the statement said. Dion is suffering from ""an illness that has caused inflammation in her throat muscles, and has not been able to perform any of her scheduled shows in Las Vegas since her last show on July 29th,"" the statement said. Dion's shows at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace have been one of the hottest tickets in Las Vegas since she returned to the Strip three years ago. Her residency, which has included about 70 shows a year, is on hold ""until further notice,"" the statement said. ""I want to devote every ounce of my strength and energy to my husband's healing, and to do so, it's important for me to dedicate this time to him and to our children,"" Dion said. ""I also want to apologize to all my fans everywhere, for inconveniencing them, and I thank them so much for their love and support."" Dion and Angelil began a romantic relationship when she was 19 and he was 45. The couple, along with their three sons, live in Las Vegas, where Dion has been performing for three years. The singer briefly retired from performing in 1999 when her husband was battling throat cancer.

"Washington (CNN) -- Again stepping into the role of compromise-seeker, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is launching what may be a long-shot effort to forge bipartisan compromise over a minimum wage increase. ""I'm reaching out to members on both sides of the aisle about whether or not it's possible,"" the Republican told a handful of reporters Tuesday. ""I don't know whether it is."" Collins laid out a possible framework she is floating in initial conversations: . â€¢ Wages: Increase the minimum wage to something higher than the current $7.25 an hour, but lower than the $10.10 that Democrats want. â€¢ Hours: To bring in more Republicans, raise the number of hours that define ""full-time"" employees under Obamacare. Currently individuals working 30 hours or more are ""full-time"" under the law. â€¢ Small business: Add an extension of small business tax credits. Ryan budget aims to cut $5.1 trillion, balance in 10 years . This is the latest example of Collins' work toward finding space for a deal on large, divisive issues. She made one of the earliest proposals to avoid the government shutdown, spent weeks trying to find agreement on an unemployment benefits extension, and has regularly been a key vote allowing issues to come to the Senate floor. For Collins, $7.25 is too low. But, $10.10 an hour is just too high. ""I've talked to employers in Maine who have said they would have to curb hiring and actually have to lay people off with that kind of increase,"" she said, ""but they are open to a more modest increase, they could accommodate that."" But as Collins tries to find a middle ground, both sides of the debate continue digging in around polar positions. Obama takes minimum wage pitch to Michigan . ""If (a bill) includes raising the minimum wage, then it's a bad idea to put people out of work,"" said Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. He and many other Republicans cite a Congressional Budget Office report which concluded that a minimum wage increase would cost the country hundreds of thousands of jobs. Toomey was well known for his attempt at compromise over background checks on guns last year, but he insists he is not budging on the minimum wage. ""If you (increase it) on a smaller scale, that I suppose makes it less bad, but it's still bad,"" he said. As Republicans exclaim ""jobs,"" those on the left shout ""poverty."" ""That minimum wage pay of $7.25 an hour is really a starvation wage,"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent. He and many Democrats point out that the same CBO report concluded that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would lift 900,000 Americans out of poverty, but a lower increase would have just one-third the effect. He insists he won't settle for a penny less than $10.10. ""No, I strongly believe we need to have a $10.10 minimum wage."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada took a similar stance in February. And what's more, Democrats have been unyielding toward many potential changes to Obamacare, including proposals to redefine ""full-time"" employees. That leaves Collins in the middle. Standing by herself outside the Senate doors, she smiled and stuck to her goal statement. ""I'm trying to see if (a potential compromise) could garner sufficient support,"" she told reporters. Reid has said a minimum wage vote could come up in the Senate as soon as next week. Asked for her timeline, Collins shrugged, ""Well, it's coming up pretty fast."" Republicans hit a nerve when it comes to Obamacare .","Republican Sen. Susan Collins is looking to see if a deal is possible .

"Washington (CNN) -- In an unprecedented move to protect U.S. troops that might be exposed to Ebola, U.S. military commanders are being given the authority to quarantine troops for 21 days at a Defense Department facility where they will be monitored for signs of the disease and treated if they do contract the virus, a Defense Department memo explained. The memo, which was obtained by CNN, spells out the details of the military's plan for the first time. It does not reveal the location of the facility, but one U.S. official said it may be a site in the Washington, D.C. area. The quarantine will apply to troops evacuated from West Africa, if it is determined they have an elevated risk of exposure to Ebola. There are more than 500 troops in the region currently, and the Pentagon has authorized the deployment of up to 4,000 to assist in fighting the virus. Troops are not expected to treat Ebola patients, but there is an acknowledgment by the Pentagon that some could be at risk of coming into contact with the virus. The October 10 memo spells out precise procedures for monitoring troops' exposure and how any problems will be dealt with. During the entire time troops are in West Africa, they may be monitored for fever or any symptoms of Ebola. If a service member comes into contact with blood or body fluids from an Ebola patient, or a dead body, while not wearing protective gear, or if the gear is compromised, they will be evacuated from the region and quarantined. Are you on the front lines fighting Ebola? Commanders also will be given the authority to isolate their entire unit in the region for the final 10 days of a deployment if necessary. All troops will be monitored for 21 days after returning from the mission, the memo says.","U.S. military commanders will be able to quarantine troops for 21 days for Ebola exposure .

"(CNN) -- For first-timers in a Korean bathhouse, stripping naked and soaking for hours in tubs with strangers often comes as a jolt. The scrub corner in any jjimjilbang (Korean bathhouse/sauna/spa/adult playground) is the section newbies find most alarming. This is because the scrub corner traffics in a completely different kind of naked intimacy -- one in which a grumpy Korean woman in black lace underwear uses a coarse towel to scrub every corner of her guest/victim's body. For most, it's a punishing, yet oddly satisfying experience. It lasts about 40 minutes -- or a few minutes longer than you'd find yourself in the ring for a championship prizefight. Good Korean scrub . The intense Korean cleansing process (called ""seshin"") entails soaking the body in hot water, then rubbing it with a ""Korean Italy towel"" -- a colorful, thin loofah with a sandpaper-like texture -- to rid the body of all the gunk, dirt and layers of dead skin that accumulate naturally. Rolls of dark, gray skin fall away as the ddemiri (scrub mistress) works away, revealing soft, pink layers of skin underneath. It's an extraordinarily rejuvenating -- and, again, painful -- process that locals embrace as a weekly ritual with family and friends. Men and women have separate bathing areas and get scrubbed by members of their own gender. Gaining traction . Korean scrubbing rituals have typically been embraced by few Westerners -- assorted Hollywood stars have gone in for quick sessions in LA's Koreatown. Otherwise, the technique is largely unknown. Over the past year or so, however, according to Seoul's Dragon Hill Spa head of public relations Hyun-Kyu Sang, the number of foreigners coming for scrubs is increasing. ""We've been noticing tourists coming to Korea and staying two nights at a hotel, and one night here, at the spa,"" says Sang, explaining that many foreign visitors opt for package deals that included a seshin option. ""A lot of tourists come to Korea and come here first, with their luggage, and get scrubbed to start their visit,"" he says. Is the Korean-style scrub on its way to becoming the next global beauty trend? If it is, we want to be among the first to check it out. That's why we went to Seoul to ask the best scrub mistresses for tips on getting the most out of a scrub session. 1. Don't touch the shower gel . While many bring their own fancy shower gel to the bathhouse to lather up before the scrub, it turns out that bar soap, not the liquid kind, is actually the way to go. ""Use the soap provided by the bathhouses during the pre-scrub shower and soak,"" says Kim Jung Yeol, who's been a scrub mistress at the Dragon Hill Spa in Yongsan, Seoul, for more than a decade. ""If you use body shampoo, the skin gets too slippery to scrub properly, and the 'dde' (dead skin rolls) doesn't come off nearly as well."" 2. Soak for 30 minutes in medium-hot water . Impatient scrubees bolt out of soaking tubs after five or 10 minutes. Korean grandmothers stay in tubs seemingly for hours. But the optimal length for a pre-scrub soak is 30 minutes. Soaking in hotter water causes the skin to wrinkle faster (a good thing), but according to a gaggle of ddemiri (scrub mistress) at Geumgansan Sauna in Hapjeong, customers should stay in the water temperature they're most comfortable with, instead of attempting a hotter tub and calling it a day after a few minutes. ""Staying in the water to prune is most important,"" says one ddemiri. 3. Be completely bare . This one may seem obvious, but scrub mistresses say many of their customers come to them without removing everything. This includes rings, earrings, glasses and other accessories. Those with long hair should bring their own hair-tie -- the ddemiri will tie their hair in a perfect bun. 4. Seriously, relax . ""Relax!"" is the instruction issued most often by the ddemiri. If the body is too rigid, the scrub mistress can't contort it into the positions necessary to get at every nook and cranny. It's awkward and painful at first, but forcing the body to relax its muscles allows the ddemiri to get things done most effectively. ""Usually customers listen and then they end up having a lot of fun,"" says Jung. 5. The fun should come afterward . This one surprises locals as well as foreigners. Though some think sitting in a spa's various hot rooms before a scrub is an effective way to get the skin ready, ddemiris advise getting scrubbed before relaxing. ""If customers get scrubbed first and then go to the hot rooms, they'll feel more refreshed, since the sweat isn't blocked by dirty pores,"" says Jung. ""Then all they have to do after is rinse off in the shower."" 6. Scrub weekly . Scrubs should be booked once a week. Any more often, and there's danger of over-exfoliation. But according to Jung, weekly scrubs improve skin vibrancy and blood circulation, as well as muscle relaxation. Jjimjilbangs to hit up for the best scrub .

"(CNN) -- Imagine gazing out over New York City, both exposed and protected. It's the sensation -- and bragging rights -- you get from showering on the patio of your terrace suite at the Bowery Hotel. ""We wanted to be able to offer our guests an extraordinary experience,"" explains Kirk Wilson, general manager of the Lower East Side hotel. It's a rare example of an urban outdoor shower, which makes it all the more enticing. For Alain de Botton, author of ""The Architecture of Happiness,"" there is an almost primitive appeal to showering alfresco. ""Any time we take something we normally do indoors and do it out of doors, there is a thrill -- because it literally symbolizes a victory of the latent fears aroused by nature. So eating outside is more fun than in the kitchen, showering, sleeping and, of course, that other kind of sleeping too."" Outdoor showers certainly give you a chance to feel at one with nature, without roughing it. At Hawaii's Four Seasons Resort Hualalai, outdoor showers take inspiration from their surroundings, incorporating lava rock and tropical plants.

"(CNN) -- Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday became the first sitting head of state to appear before the International Criminal Court, where he faces charges of crimes against humanity. Kenyatta, 52, is accused of five counts of crimes against humanity for allegedly orchestrating violence after a disputed presidential election in 2007. Shortly before he left for the Netherlands, he appointed his deputy president to serve as acting President, saying he is attending the hearing at The Hague as a private citizen. More than 1,000 people died and hundreds of thousands were displaced when ethnic groups loyal to leading candidates torched homes and hacked rivals in violence that raged until early 2008. Kenyatta, who backed then-incumbent Mwai Kibaki in that election, is accused of funding a local militia that conducted reprisal attacks. The second day of the status hearing will determine whether his case can proceed to trial. The first day was held Tuesday, but he was not required to attend. The court mandated that he be present on the last day. During the hearing Tuesday, the prosecution accused the Kenyan government of not providing key documents in the case against its leader. The defense denied the allegation. Kenya is the second African nation after Sudan to have a sitting president face charges at the International Criminal Court. But Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir does not cooperate with the court, and has rejected ICC warrants for his arrest for alleged war crimes in Darfur. Lack of evidence . ""My conscience is clear, has been clear, and will remain forever clear that I am innocent of all the accusations leveled against me,"" Kenyatta said before he boarded the plane in Nairobi. The ICC prosecutor has postponed the start of the trial numerous times, citing lack of evidence. The prosecution has suffered a series of setbacks, with witnesses withdrawing and others admitting to lying. ""In ordinary circumstances, the insufficiency of evidence would cause the prosecution to withdraw the charges,"" the ICC said in September. ""However, it would be inappropriate for the prosecution to withdraw the charges at this stage in light of the government of Kenya continuing failure to cooperate fully with the court's requests for assistance in this case."" This is the first time Kenyatta is attending a hearing in person since he assumed office in April last year. Deputy president also facing charges . The ICC has also accused Deputy President William Ruto of orchestrating attacks. His trial started in September 2013. Both leaders have denied any links to the violence among their respective ethnic groups, and have said they will cooperate with the court to clear their names. ICC withdrawal? The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The Parliament of Kenya voted in September to withdraw from ICC jurisdiction after repeatedly calling on the court to drop the cases. But a withdrawal would take a while to implement because it involves steps such as a formal notification to the United Nations. The ICC has said the trials will proceed. The nation's previous administration reneged on a deal to set up a special tribunal to try suspects in the post-election violence, prompting the international court to step in.

"(CNN) -- Police have arrested 27 people in Singapore after a riot that erupted on Sunday after a foreign worker died in a traffic accident. A crowd of more than 400 people hurled objects and set fire to vehicles in Singapore's Little India district on Sunday evening after a 33-year-old Indian man was run over by a private bus while crossing the road, the Singapore Police Force said in a statement. At least 18 people -- including 10 police officers, as well as the bus driver and conductor -- were injured in the riot, which was the first major outbreak of violence in the country for more than 40 years. It took some 300 police and special defense forces to bring the violence under control, according to Police Commissioner Ng Joo Hee. Eyewitness: ""This doesn't really happen in Singapore"" Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong described the riot as a ""very grave incident."" ""Whatever events may have sparked the rioting, there is no excuse for such violent, destructive, and criminal behavior,"" he said in a statement released on his official Facebook page. ""We will spare no effort to identify the culprits and deal with them with the full force of the law,"" Lee said. Debts and dreams: Singapore's migrant workers . Videos posted online appear to show men smashing the windscreen of the bus involved in the fatal accident. In other footage, black smoke is seen billowing from an overturned police car. The mob reportedly attacked rescue crews as they attempted to reach the Indian worker's body, which was trapped under the bus, according to the Straits Times. Migrant workers -- mainly from India and Bangladesh -- are known to gather in Little India on Sundays, which is typically their day off. Singapore has strict laws on public assembly and rioting on this scale has not been seen since 1969, when clashes between Chinese and Malay residents left 36 people dead and another 556 injured. If convicted, the 27 men arrested in connection with Sunday's violence face up to seven years in prison and caning. Police said the intersection where the accident occurred, had reopened on Monday morning.","Police arrest 27 people in Singapore after a worker's death sparks riots .

"(CNN) -- From 1976 to 1985 the Kansas City Royals were awesome. They had one of the best hitters in the game. They had sharp young pitchers. They were a part of almost every October. But the 1985 World Series comeback win over the St. Louis Cardinals was the Royals' last taste of glory until Wednesday, when this year's team rumbled back into the Fall Classic, sweeping the Baltimore Orioles to win the American League Championship Series. For much of the past 29 years, the Royals haven't been a baseball afterthought, they've been a non-thought, except for their loyal fans. There's plenty of room on the Royals bandwagon, so if you're thinking about getting on, here are five things to consider: . They're not baseball royalty . If asked to name one Kansas City Royal, most people would say George Brett. If asked to name a current Royal, most people would be silent. But don't be too embarrassed, this is a team that doesn't have any huge stars. They don't even have many celebrity fans. We think they have one -- actor Paul Rudd. They don't make splashy news in the free agent market. They built a great team through some smart draft picks and augmented the roster through a few nifty trades. But none of the names in the lineup stands out to people who don't closely follow the game. Seriously, had you heard of Lorenzo Cain until October? (He was the most valuable player of the ALCS, by the way) They can pick it . It seems like you can't hit a ball where the Royals ain't. On Wednesday, the Orioles smoked four balls in the first two innings right on the nose. Every one was turned into an out. The game was punctuated by a great catch by Alex Gordon, who slammed into the left-field wall just after his glove swallowed the ball. Before the season, a whole lot of experts said the Royals had some of the best fielders in the majors, but then they made a 104 errors, including a stretch of 35 in 35 games. So far they've had far more great plays than errors (just three in eight games) in a tense and tight postseason. They believe . The Royals haven't lost in the post season since 1985. Well, that's in part because they haven't been in the playoffs since 1985 when they won the last three against the St. Louis Cardinals to win the World Series, four games to three. But check this, they've won 11 straight games in the postseason. All eight this year, most of them of the nail-biting, gotta-get-a-clutch-hit variety. They were four runs down and six outs from being bounced out of the playoffs before it really even started. But they rallied to beat the Athletics in extra innings in a thrilling Wild Card game and dispatched the highly favored Angels with two extra-innings wins and a rare ho-hum easy ""W"" in the division series. They swept the Orioles in four but they only outscored them by six runs. It helps the offense to know the bullpen is going to lock it down so all they have to do is keep it close, third baseman Mike Moustakas said. ""This team just doesn't panic,"" he said. They just have fun . Bo knows. Former Royal Bo Jackson says the kids on this team are a joy to watch. ""It's been a long time since I've seen professional athletes have fun and enjoy the heck out of coming to work every day,"" he told sports host Jim Rome this week. The lack of outward happiness could stem from the huge money that puts pressure on players to perform, he said. Well, the not-so-regally compensated Royals -- they are 18th out of 30 teams in the majors in payroll at $91 million -- don't take the field with high expectations or a lot of pressure. This team has been rebuilding and manager Ned Yost accepts stumbles that come with a youthful team. ""To watch them go through the last couple of years, the ups and the downs and to finally get to this point, I am very proud of them,"" he said. They are due . It was about a decade ago that the Royals lost 310 games in three years. It wouldn't even be June yet and Royals fans were already ready to give up. You never knew who the Royals fans were in your office because they never had anything to brag on. It's been 29 years since their team had won a playoff game, let alone go to the World Series. Sure, there are teams with longer droughts, but these Royals are the likeable and plucky underdogs who just can't seem to be bothered with losing. CNN's Jill Martin contributed to this report.","The Kansas City Royals clinched a spot in the World Series on Wednesday night .

"(CNN) -- After a setback from the natural and nuclear disasters of 2011, tourism has rebounded in Tokyo. The Japan National Tourism Office reports a 21% increase in visitor arrival numbers between January and August 2013 compared with the same period last year. The renewed surge of visitors is being partly attributed to Tokyo's successful bid for the 2020 Olympics and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to bulk up the economy. Fall is the classic time to visit the city. The oppressive humidity of summer has cleared, autumn colors bring life to Tokyo's many parks, hearty, seasonal foods are the order of the day and the fresh fashion the country is known for is celebrated on the streets. More: Guide to Tokyo's best parks . From sedate, centuries-old gardens to boisterous robot cabarets, here's the vital knowledge you'll need before hitting Japan's sprawling capital. 1. Tip No. 1: Don't tip . Attentive service is the norm in Japan, part of a cultural dedication to hospitality called omotenashi. Tipping isn't expected in taxis, at hair salons, for doormen or bartenders. Not only are gratuities not expected, they won't be accepted. Some restaurant checks will include a service charge. If you leave money behind, no matter how much or little, don't be surprised if your server chases you down the street to return it. More: 50 reasons Tokyo is the world's greatest city . 2. Walk right -- on the left . With 35 million people, greater Tokyo is one of the most densely populated urban centers in the world. Yet crowds are orderly. Everyone waits until the light changes to cross the street. Pedestrians on wide sidewalks follow the unspoken rule of staying to the left almost as strictly as cars (also on the left) do. Exception: On Tokyo escalators, stand on the left and walk on the right. (Around Osaka, escalator etiquette is reversed.) 3. Drink outside, smoke inside . The more enclosed a space is, the more likely you'll be allowed to smoke there. The smaller and homier a bar or restaurant, the more likely it is to be smoker-friendly. Many bullet trains still have smoking cars. On the other hand, smoking is prohibited on many sidewalks (look for signs stenciled on the sidewalk), except around public ashtrays. Street patrols stop people who engage in aruki-tabako, or ""walking-smoking."" Cracking open a beer or can of fruity, boozy chu-hai on the walk or train home, however, is a cherished tradition. More: 5 Tokyo bars for train nerds (yes, they exist) 4. One card is good for all trains and buses . The Tokyo train system is actually a network of three train companies. Originally, each system required its own tickets. Now rechargeable Suica and Pasmo cards let riders seamlessly touch their way in and out of all lines. As of March 2013, paying fares got even easier -- a single card became usable for trains and buses throughout the country. You can get one as soon as you arrive in Tokyo from almost any ticket machine. The ¥500 deposit (a little over $5) for the card is refundable. The time you save not calculating ticket costs makes it worthwhile even if you keep the card as a souvenir. 5. There are pockets of quiet everywhere . From temples hidden between office buildings (Hanazono Shrine in Shinjuku is a favorite of these) to the tree-lined canal that runs the length of Nakameguro, you're never far from an oasis of calm in the frantic city. Winding residential streets lined with walled gardens are often just a block away from busy main roads. If you take a detour down a little unmarked road (most Japanese streets are unnamed) chances are you'll discover a tiny cafe, quirky neighborhood art project or a jumble of ultramodern condos and rickety ancient architecture. More: Insider Guide: What to do in Tokyo . 6. Japanese bathhouses . Public bathhouses, or sento, are a soothing holdover from a time when most homes didn't have bathtubs. Whether it's a bright, modern place in Omotesando with fizzy water and fancy soap or a creaky neighborhood bath with a coin-operated hairdryer that's been bolted to the floor since the 1960s, all public baths cost ¥450. The Tokyo Sento Association is redoubling efforts to make them foreigner friendly ahead of the Olympics by posting etiquette and instruction cards in four languages. 7. That word you keep hearing is 'welcome' After a few days in Tokyo, you might find yourself asking, ""What's that thing they always say when I walk in?"" Whether it's sweaty, aproned guys shouting in unison as you walk into an izakaya (lively restaurants that serve alcohol with lots of small dishes) or one perfectly coiffed woman murmuring as you enter the hush of a small boutique, they're saying the same thing: ""Irasshaimase."" It's a polite way of saying ""welcome."" Although your instinct may be to reply -- ""Thank you?"" ""Hello?"" -- locals insist no response is required. A friendly little bow in response doesn't hurt, though. 8. The sushi really is that good . The famous tuna auction at Tsukiji market starts just after 5 a.m., but the day's 120 free tickets are often all snapped up as early as 4. Whether you get to the auction or not, the market and surrounding shops will be springing to life around that time -- it's the best place to enjoy an early morning plate of the freshest sushi you've ever tasted. You need not be there that early, but many of the hundreds of shops start to close by 1 p.m. Visit and you, too, will be one of those insufferable diners who can't eat sushi back home without saying, ""It's good, but it's nothing like the maguro I had in Japan."" But hurry -- the legendary market is set to close at the end of 2013. A new facility will open a few kilometers away in 2014. More: Iconic fish market to close . 9. Free WiFi is rare . While the number of places that have free and simple WiFi in Japan is increasing, access isn't something you can count on. Signs everywhere announce free WiFi -- if you already have a contract with the provider. Even places like Starbucks that have relatively accessible free WiFi require you to create an account in advance. Instead of renting a SIM card, many travelers find that renting a pocket WiFi at the airport to use with their own smartphones is the best way to get online. 10. Bacon turns up everywhere . Japan has a long tradition of Buddhist vegetarian cuisine called shojin ryori. It is painstakingly prepared and served on fine lacquerware and ceramics. It's worth experiencing (Michelin-starred Itosho is outstanding) and guaranteed to be vegetarian, but it's expensive and a time-consuming affair. For a quick veggie meal, you usually have to be vigilant. A ""vegetable sandwich"" may have a sneaky slice of ham in it, and pasta with ""no meat"" could be studded with chunks of bacon. ""Meat"" tends to mean ""beef."" Running down a list of every animal product that you'd like to avoid is the only way to be sure. And your potato salad might still come with bacon. 11. Clear umbrellas are the best umbrellas . Into every vacation a little rain must fall. If you're in Japan when it does, lucky you -- it's a perfect opportunity to pick up a clear umbrella. It's such a simple innovation, you wonder why they haven't caught on elsewhere. Once the first drops of rain hit the street, you'll find them everywhere. Convenience stores will put their stock by the door. One costs between ¥300 and ¥500. The clerk will offer to unwrap it for you if you're using it right away. Hold on tightly, but let go lightly; umbrellas are the one item that's frequently stolen in Tokyo. If yours disappears, consider it a rite of passage.

"(CNN) -- It looks like a portal to another dimension crafted from alien technology to bridge yawning chasms across time and space. In reality, it's a fruit and vegetable market. Either way, it's unlikely that anyone could fail to be excited by the prospect of loading up on groceries at Markthal, a combined food hall and housing project that opened earlier this month in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam. The development, already feted by architecture critics, houses 100 market stalls beneath a gigantic, brightly decorated archway that contains 228 apartments. Informally known as the ""Horseshoe,"" the impressive structure adds to the limited roster of attractions in Rotterdam. To date the city's chief tourism claims are that it's the busiest container port in Europe and is home to the Netherlands' most popular zoo. 'Valhalla of food' Designed by Dutch architectural firm MVRDV, Markthal is a key project in a major regeneration of the city center around Rotterdam's Binnenrotte Square. The building is described in promotional materials as a ""Valhalla of food."" ""The combination of an apartment building covering a fresh food market with food shops, restaurants, a supermarket and an underground parking is found nowhere else in the world,"" it says. It's certainly a first for the Netherlands. The archway, closed at either end by vast walls of glass, is the country's only indoor food market and has been built in response to new regulations that require produce retailers to be under cover. So it's functional and street legal as well as eye-popping.","Rotterdam's new food hall resembles vast intergalactic installation .

"(CNN) -- They dedicate their lives to saving others, but as Ebola spreads worldwide, health care workers must also focus on saving themselves. An American doctor and a North Carolina missionary working with Ebola victims were the first to bring the deadly virus to the United States when they contracted the virus in Liberia and were flown home for treatment. Now, a Dallas nurse has set a similar milestone, becoming the first person known to have contracted the disease inside the U.S. She was wearing the proscribed protective gear -- gloves, mask and shield -- while recently caring for Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan at a Dallas hospital. Duncan died last week. While the Texas nurse remains in isolation, a nurse in Spain who contracted the virus after treating a patient in that country is struggling for her life. There are so many caregivers who've become patients. At least 416 health care workers have contracted Ebola, and at least 233 have died, the World Health Organization reports. In Liberia, the worst-affected country, the virus has killed more than 100 medical workers. Since the Ebola outbreak began -- the worst the world has seen -- doctors and nurses have described working conditions no one should endure. Every single move they make in treating a patient must be perfect. One slip-up -- a torn glove or the smallest splat of infected fluid that gets on them -- could cost them their lives. One provider in West Africa spoke of waking up every morning with a sore throat from constantly breathing in the fumes from chlorine that must be constantly sprayed to kill the virus that is capable of thriving not just in living organisms but on surfaces for some time if conditions are right. Health care workers battle not just a disease but rumors among patients in Africa that Ebola is a myth the government is perpetrating. In a profession that already demands much emotionally and physically, these caregivers are pushed to the edge in both respects. They have lost friends, colleagues and patients. All this as they beat back their own understandable paranoia and fear. Have I done everything correctly? Could I be next? Caregivers' cry for help . Last week, Doctors Without Borders, an independent international organization that helps victims of tragedies in the world's most dangerous zones, said that a Norwegian staffer had contracted Ebola. The staffer had been working in the Sierra Leone city of Bo and was being sent to Europe for treatment. Doctors Without Borders said it's repeatedly asked for help from the international community but ""to this date, very little has materialized in concrete action on the ground,"" its website says. The organization's teams, composed of 3,058 staff working in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Senegal, are seeing ""critical gaps in all aspects of the response, including medical care, training of health staff, infection control, contact tracing, epidemiological surveillance, alert and referral systems and community education and mobilization."" In September, CNN visited Bomi County, Liberia, where there were only two doctors covering its 85,000 residents and trying to care for Ebola patients in a 12-bed facility that wasn't even a proper Ebola treatment center. A nurse inside a Monrovia clinic wore a camera showing his job, revealing that he worked inside a clinic with seemingly unclean conditions. Patients were lying on stretchers on floors that appear filthy, and there were open buckets lying around with objects and substances in them. The situation for caregivers across Liberia has become so dire that nurses are now are threatening to strike. Just days ago, CNN's cameras captured crowds of caregivers yelling outside Liberia's largest Ebola treatment center in Monrovia. Underscoring the serious consequences of a Liberia without health care workers, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf arrived to try to calm the crowd. ""We're trying to meet all their needs, and we'll continue to do that,"" she told CNN, struggling to be heard above the shouting. ""I don't want to strike,"" one caregiver said, telling CNN that he foresees deaths increasing several thousand-fold if facilities' conditions don't improve. ""But the President has to listen to the massive health care workers out there,"" he said. ""There are angry people. You don't want to have angry people knocking on your doors during this kind of emergency situation."" This weekend, The Washington Post detailed horrific conditions at a Monrovia Ebola facility where one doctor died from Ebola and another tested positive for the virus. The Post reported: ""Doctors put on their protective gear in the kitchen. There is no incinerator, so a 10-foot pile of Ebola-laced garbage and excrement sits in the back yard. There is no morgue, so bodies sometimes decay outside, next to where patients sit in white lawn chairs. There are no protective hoods for the full-body medical suits,"" so caregivers make their own. There have also been questions about how tight security is at health care centers. In August, CNN reported that an Ebola treatment facility in Monrovia was overrun by an armed mob who stole mattresses and equipment. Ebola patients fled, local authorities said. A legacy of self-sacrifice . The mother of modern nursing, Florence Nightingale, suffered for her dedication to treating patients during the Crimea War. It's believed that she also contracted a bacterial infection as she treated the wounded, dealing the effects of the illness for much of her life. Just as Nightingale was revered as a hero, so too was Dr. Sheik Umar Khan, a top doctor from Sierra Leone who specialized in Ebola. He died in late July from the virus. He had been overseeing Ebola treatment at Kenema Government Hospital, about 185 miles east of Sierra Leone's capital city, Freetown. Doctors Without Borders was treating him. If Khan could get sick, then any other caregiver could, wrote Dr. Oliver Johnson from King's College London, who treated Ebola patients this summer. Read more: Ebola's frontline -- battling fear and the deadly virus . Even before the Ebola outbreak, Sierra Leone had already been suffering from a shortage of doctors, nurses and infrastructure, he said. The jobs of health care workers were made all the worse when they attempted to track and monitor the contacts of infected people because roads were difficult to traverse. Crowded housing made the effort even more difficult, he said. Yet even with the best medicine in the most modern facilities does not guarantee safety. The nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas who has Ebola had ""extensive contact"" at the same hospital with an Ebola patient who died last week, health officials said. The woman had on a gown, gloves, mask and a shield when she visited the patient multiple times, they said, but there was a breach in treatment protocol. Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, did not detail what that breach might have been. But Frieden did say that merely taking off protective gear is ""a major potential area for risk"" if not done meticulously, and officials are investigating whether that's what might have caused the nurse to become infected. Hours after Frieden spoke, nurses who are part of the union National Nurses United gathered in Oakland, California, for their own news conference. Holding up signs that said ""Stop blaming nurses. Stop Ebola,"" they blasted the notion that they would be at fault. Her voice rising as she spoke, Katy Roemer, a 20-year nursing veteran, said that colleagues throughout the United States. have reported to the union that they are not being adequately trained to recognize and care for Ebola patients even though they have asked employers for that. ""They have not given us this information,"" she said. Enormous pressure and risks . What does it feel like to know you're going to treat a patient with a disease that kills 90% of its victims? What is it like to have never before dealt with Ebola, but know that a patient is about to land in your hospital under your care? ""There was no way to fully prepare for the pressure, the national focus, the immensity of being responsible for curing a patient whose deadly disease was at the center of global debate,"" wrote Angela Hewlett in The Washington Post. The infectious disease physician is an assistant medical director for the Nebraska Biocontainment Patient Care Unit at the Nebraska Medical Center where she treated American Dr. Richard Sacra. Sacra, who had worked as a missionary in Liberia, was treated in isolation at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha and then released after testing negative for the virus. She wrote about going through drills and training and about feeling nervous before he arrived. She talked with her family about what they might experience from people judging or making comments born of ignorance and fear about the virus. She also illuminated the difference between a doctor who able to connect and comfort a patient through touch by placing a hand on an arm. Establishing that calm and assurance is a vital and human part of being a caregiver. But Ebola takes that from nurses and doctors. It is interrupted by bulky gear. The key to not getting Ebola, after all, is to keep those suffering separate from others. And yet nurses and doctors continue their work out of practical necessity and because it's their commitment and passion and because, as Hewlett noted, they are fascinated by how medicine might defeat a virus that's considered a global threat. And for some in West Africa, it really is a matter of survival. ""What's else can we do? If we don't do it, who will do it for us?"" one Liberian nurse told CNN. ""So we have to take the risk and care for the patients or else our country will be wiped away."" Read more: Cuban doctor train to fight Ebola .

"Washington (CNN) -- Gov. Chris Christie's office said Monday that the nurse quarantined at a New Jersey hospital is being allowed to transfer to Maine, the latest development in a medical and political saga regarding possible cases of Ebola in the U.S., and how politicians in charge are responding. A battle of words broke out during the weekend between Kaci Hickox, who returned home from Ebola-ravaged West Africa only to be ordered into quarantine, and the Republican governor. The nurse told CNN that her ""basic human rights have been violated"" and that Christie himself was responsible. Hickox will be transported by a private carrier, ""not via mass transit or commercial aircraft,"" read the statement, which was blasted out by Christie's office. Gov. Paul LePage said in a statement Maine will work with Hickox ""to establish an in-home quarantine protocol to ensure there is no direct contact with other Mainers until the period for potential infection has passed."" Steven Hyman, an attorney for Hickox, told CNN's Alexandra Field her first priority is to get out of the hospital and back to a normal life. Hyman argued ""there is a legal basis to challenge"" the New Jersey policy, but ""whether she wants to do it remains to be seen."" While in Florida campaigning for Republican Gov. Rick Scott, Christie stood by New Jersey's quarantine policy. ""I know she didn't want to be there. No one ever wants to be in the hospital, I suspect, and so I understand that,"" he told reporters. ""But the fact is I have a much greater, bigger responsibility to the people and the public, and so I think when she has time to reflect she will understand that as well."" Hickox was the first medical professional to be quarantined in New Jersey immediately upon returning to the United States from West Africa, where she had worked in treating Ebola patients. She lashed out at Christie during the weekend for giving her a diagnosis of sorts as ""obviously ill."" ""First of all, I don't think he's a doctor; secondly, he's never laid eyes on me; and thirdly, I've been asymptomatic since I've been here,"" Hickox told CNN's Candy Crowley in a phone interview Sunday. ""There always needs to be a balance, because I also want to be treated with compassion and humanity,"" Hickox said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" by phone from her hospital isolation. ""I don't feel like I have been treated that way in the past three days."" Mandatory quarantines: Now what? In an off-camera interview with CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen, Hickox added, ""I am not, as he said 'obviously ill.' I am completely healthy and with no symptoms. And if he knew anything about Ebola he would know that asymptomatic people are not infectious."" The White House seemed to agree with Hickox's sentiment that Christie doesn't have the medical authority to impose regulations that trump federal guidelines on handling Ebola patients. A senior administration official told CNN on Sunday that the White House informed Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo -- who also ordered quarantine for people returning to his state from West Africa -- along with other state officials that it ""has concerns with the unintended consequences of policies that are not grounded in science may have on efforts to combat Ebola at its source in West Africa.""","NEW: Quarantined nurse to be discharged, Chris Christie's office announces .

"(CNN) -- Regardless of whether or not you're religious, you can't help but feel a sense of awe when coming face to face with the grand statues that devout throughout the ages have built in honor of their deities. And these monuments just keep getting bigger. The Nepalese government recently unveiled the world's largest trident -- a religious statue depicting Shiva -- at a Hindu temple in Dang. The trident is made from five different minerals, weighs more than six tons and stands 12 meters (42 feet) tall. It joins an already impressive roster of Hindu, Buddhist and Christian statues built around the world -- including these 10 greats. Lord Murugan Statue (Selangor, Malaysia) This statue, measuring 42 meters (137 feet) in height, is said to be the world's tallest depiction of a Hindu deity. Fifteen skilled sculptors from India carried out construction on the Lord Murugan Statue, found outside Malaysia's famed Batu Caves. The statue took three years to complete and the finished product -- made up of 250 tons of steel, 1,550 cubic meters of concrete and 300 liters of gold paint -- was unveiled during the annual Thaipusam festival in 2006. Incidentally, it's just meters away from what must rank as one of the world's strangest statues -- a five-legged bull. Batu Caves, Selangor, Malaysia; +60 3 6189 6284 . Christ of the Abyss (Key Largo, Florida) This 2.6 meter (8.6 foot) submerged bronze statue of Jesus Christ in Key Largo, Florida is one of three created by Italian artist Guido Galletti (the others can be found in the waters off Grenada in the Caribbean and in the Mediterranean sea near Italy). The statue weighs 260 kilograms and is held in place with a 9-ton concrete base. It was dropped into place in 1965 and its location, just seven meters below the surface of water, means that it's visible to swimmers as well as scuba divers. It's also a highlight of the local glass-bottom boat tours. John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, Key Largo, Florida; +1 305 451 6300 . Tian Tan Buddha (Hong Kong) This enormous statue -- the world's largest seated outdoor bronze Buddha -- took 12 years to complete. It's located next to Hong Kong's Po Lin Monastery, regarded as the territory's center of Buddhism. Tian Tan Buddha stands 34 meters (112 feet) high, weighs 250 tons and can be seen from as far away as Macau. Beneath the Buddha are three floors that are said to contain the remains of Shakyamuni, the sage on whose teachings Buddhism was founded. There is also an enormous carved bell that's rung every seven minutes, symbolizing the release of 108 kinds of human vexations. Po Lin Monastery, Ngong Ping, Lantau island, Hong Kong; +852 2985 5248 . Leshan Giant Buddha (Sichuan, China) This 71-meter (232 feet) stone statue was built during the Tang dynasty and can be found at the confluence of the Minjiang, Dadu and Qingyi rivers. Construction of the Buddha, which forms part of a UNESCO-listed site, started in 713 AD, though it wasn't finished until 803. A local Chinese monk called Haitong believed that the presence of a stone Buddha would calm the rivers it overlooked. Funding ran out and Haitong killed himself in despair, but when a local governor decided to undertake completion of the project, Haitong's wish came true -- though not quite in the way he intended. During construction, so much rock was removed from the cliff face and deposited in the river below that the water became shallower and easier to navigate. Leshan Giant Buddha, Mount Emei Scenic Area, Leshan, Sichuan, China; +86 833 230 2296 . Laykyun Setkyar (Monywa, Myanmar) Myanmar's Laykyun Setkyar is one of the largest statues in the world, with a height of 116 meters (380 feet). Construction of the statue, which depicts the Gautama Buddha, started in 1996 and finished in 2008. There are 32 stories within the Buddha, 12 of which are dedicated to detailed descriptions of hell. Khatakan Taung, Monywa, Myanmar . Christ the Redeemer (Rio de Janeiro) This 30-meter (98 feet) Brazil icon weighs 635 tons and was constructed between 1922 and 1931, although the concept for such a statue was first brought up in the 1850s. However, in 1889 the country became a republic and, with the separation of church and state, the idea was dismissed. In 1920 the Catholic Circle of Rio started collecting donations from Brazilian Catholics to fund the construction of the statue, commissioning local engineer Heitor da Silva Costa to design it. It has lightning rods on the arms, head and hands -- on average, it's hit by lightning 12 times every summer. Parque Nacional da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; +21 2491 1700 . Cristo de la Concordia (Cochabamba, Bolivia) The Cristo de la Concordia is the second-largest statue of Jesus in the world and the third largest statue in the southern hemisphere. At a height of 33 meters (one for every year of Christ's life), it's just a few centimeters higher than the Christ Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro. On Sundays, visitors can climb to the upper section of Cristo de la Concordia for breathtaking views from observation decks located inside the arms. Av de la Concordia, Cochabamba, Bolivia; +591 4 422 8530 . Sendai Daikannon (Sendai, Japan) This gleaming white statue located in Sendai, Japan, is the sixth tallest statue in the world and depicts a Japanese Bodhisattva, or enlightened being. At 100-meters high (328 feet), she holds a wishing stone in her right hand and a water jug in the left. An internal elevator allows visitors to access the higher sections. Travel tip: The statue faces Sendai station, which is in the center area of the city, so if you ever get lost simply follow the statue's gaze to the center of town. Sendai Daikannon, Sanezawa, Izumi-ku, Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan; +81 22 278 1227 . Wat Pho's reclining Buddha (Bangkok) Located just meters from Bangkok's Grand Palace in the Wat Pho temple complex, this reclining Buddha measures 15 meters (49 feet) high and 43 meters (141 feet) long. The most ornate parts are the feet, which are inlaid with mother-of-pearl panels featuring symbols that represent the Buddha, including flowers, elephants and tigers. Above the statue is a seven-tiered umbrella representing the state of Thailand and 108 bronze bowls are placed along its length. Visitors are invited to make a wish as they place a coin in each of the bowls. All donations go towards maintenance of the Wat Pho temple. Wat Pho, 2 Sanamchai Road, Grand Palace Subdistrict, Pranakorn District, Bangkok, Thailand; +66 2 226 0335 . Buddha Dordenma (Thimphu, Bhutan) When completed, this gold and bronze sculpture will be one of the tallest Buddha statues in the world, with a height of 51 meters (169 feet). Originally due for completion in 2010, it's now hoped that work will finish next year, by which time, $47 million will have been spent on construction. China's Aerosun Corporation is covering this cost. The interior will house 125,000 smaller Buddhas and a meditation hall.

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- Wednesday's convention programming followed Tuesday's standard script: red meat for the base in the early hours, capped off with a slightly sweeter offering in prime time for independent consumption. But there was nothing routine about Bill Clinton's speech. The 48-minute address -- nearly 3,200 words of prepared text and a thousand more of classic Clinton riffs -- checked off nearly every item on the Obama campaign's wish list: . • Appeal to the persuadable who cite bipartisanship as a key quality: Clinton praised Eisenhower. He quoted Reagan. He even got an arena-full of loyal Democrats to cheer George W. Bush. Gergen: Now it's up to Obama . ""Through my foundation, in America and around the world, I work with Democrats, Republicans and independents who are focused on solving problems and seizing opportunities, not fighting each other,"" Clinton said. ""When times are tough, constant conflict may be good politics but in the real world, cooperation works better."" • Re-frame Romney without alienating bipartisanship-worshipping swing voters: Heading into Wednesday, Clinton's presidential record and his assessment of Romney had played a starring role in campaign ads... for the Republican nominee. Both members of the GOP ticket have maximized that advantage by singing Clinton's praises on the trail. But the risk for Romney had been that in highlighting and praising Clinton's judgment, he invested in it a legitimacy that gave Clinton's attacks Wednesday even more potency. Clinton's toughest punches came wrapped in silk gloves; his most brutal critiques were paired with a side of smiles, jokes and ad libs -- the sort of delivery that allows an attack line to resonate far beyond the base. Hillary Clinton in Asia, misses husband's speech . • Push back on the GOP's welfare attack: Despite near-universal pans from fact-checkers who have repeatedly found the claim that Obama has gutted the work requirement for welfare a false one, Republican and Democratic consultants alike had concluded Romney campaign's summer push on that front had begun paying real dividends. Enter the man who signed the original 1996 welfare reform bill into law. ""This is personal to me,"" Clinton said. ""....But I am telling you the claim that President Obama weakened welfare reform's work requirement is just not true. But they keep on running ads claiming it. You want to know why? Their campaign pollster said, 'We are not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers.' "" The Romney campaign made a gamble with its Clinton praise. Wednesday was a case study in the inherent pitfalls of that sort of approach. • Cast Obama as his ideological heir and most likely to bring back the Clinton boom years: Clinton acknowledged the sluggish recovery but drew a direct parallel to his own presidency: ""I experienced the same thing in 1994 and early 1995. Our policies were working and the economy was growing but most people didn't feel it yet,"" he said. ""By 1996, the economy was roaring, halfway through the longest peacetime expansion in American history."" Obama was starting with a much weaker economy, he said -- and ""no president"" could repair the damage in a single term. ""But he has the foundation for a new modern, successful economy of prosperity. If you renew the president's contract, you will feel it. You will feel it."" In other words: an Obama second-term economy would look a lot like mine. Obama has used some variation of that theme in his stump speech for months. But Clinton was able to draw a straighter line between their records. Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos dubbed it ""the moment that probably re-elected Barack Obama."" Obama to speak after forceful Clinton endorsement .","Ex-president's 48-minute speech, much of it ad-libbed, was classic Clinton .

"(CNN) -- The look of total surprise on her face said it all. Alia Atkinson went into the final of the 100m breaststroke at the world short course swimming championships very much as the second favorite to Olympic champion Ruta Meilutyte of Lithuania. But in a big upset the 25-year-old from Jamaica snatched victory on the final stroke from Meilutyte and with it made swimming history. Not only had she equaled Meiluyte's world best but also became the first swimmer black woman to claim a world title in the pool. ""I realized I was catching up so I was just trying to get a good finish,"" she told the official FINA website. ""I'm not used to seeing my name up in number one so it was kind of a shock, but a good one!"" 17-year-old Meilutyte, who trains in England, had led going down the final length of the 25-meter pool, looking set to complete the 50-100m double, until Atkinson's late charge. The winning time of one minute 2.36 seconds left Atkinson 0.1 seconds ahead of her great rival, who claimed gold over 100m at the London Olympics. Atkinson, who was fourth in that final, has been steadily improving since claiming gold for Texas A&M at the 2010 NCAA championships. It was also Jamaica's first ever gold in world swimming championships and Atkinson had come close in the 50m final, losing out to Meilutyte on the touch. The first black woman to hold a world record in the pool was Enith Brigitha of the Netherlands, some 40 years ago. Brigitha also took bronze medals behind two East German winners in both the 100 and 200m freestyle events at the 1976 Montreal Olympics and won four bronze medals in the 1973 and 1975 world championships.","Alia Atkinson of Jamaica wins gold medal at swimming world championships .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Zalman King, a onetime actor who went on to produce and direct numerous films including ""Wild Orchid,"" died Friday after a lengthy battle with cancer, his son-in-law said. King was 70. After fighting cancer for six years, King died Friday morning at his home in Santa Monica, California, son-in-law Allison Burnett told CNN. His wife and longtime contributor, writer-director Patricia Louisiana Knopp, was by his side. Born Zalman Lefkovitz, King broke into Hollywood in the 1960s as an actor with roles on several TV series including ""The Alfred Hitchcock Hour,"" ""Bonanza,"" ""Gunsmoke"" and ""The Young Lawyers,"" according to the online Internet Movie Database website, imdb.com. He produced several films in the 1980s, including the erotic drama ""9Â½ Weeks"" starring Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke. And in 1989, King moved behind the camera to direct ""Wild Orchid,"" written by him and his wife and featuring Rourke and Jacqueline Bisset. According to Burnett, late director Stanley Kubrick would call King ""every night"" while shooting ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, to get ideas on shooting erotic scenes. King also knew Martin Sheen for decades, as well as his son Charlie Sheen, according to Burnett. The former ""Platoon,"" ""Wall Street"" and ""Two and a Half Men"" star lauded King as a ""brilliant and noble soul"" in a statement Friday on his website.

"(CNN) -- Reality TV star Tila Tequila suffered facial cuts when she was pelted with rocks and bottles while performing at a music festival in Illinois early Saturday, according to a witness and a law enforcement official. ""She's pretty cut up,"" said a performer who saw the violence at the ""Gathering of the Juggalos"" in rural Hardin County, Illinois. The witness asked not to be identified so that he does not anger the juggalos. Tequila, a Playboy model who also sings, posted a Twitter message Saturday, saying she would sue the festival, which is organized for fans of the hip-hop group Insane Clown Posse. ""Pretty soon, the owners who run the juggalos will be bankrupt,"" she tweeted. The fans are mostly young people who sometimes wear clown make up and are referred to as juggalos and juggalettes. Festival organizers did not immediately respond to CNN requests for a response. The performer said a mob of hundreds chased Tequila from the stage and surrounded the trailer where she sought refuge. They rocked the trailer and smashed its windows, the witness said. Tequila eventually escaped, but only after windows in her SUV were smashed, he said. Hardin County Sheriff Tom Seiner, who offered a similar description of the events, said he has an open investigation.  It would be ""very hard"" to identify the attackers unless he can locate video of the incident, the sheriff said. Tequila offered her descriptions of the events in a statement to celebrity news website TMZ. ""I went onstage and immediately, before I even got on stage, dudes were throwing huge stone rocks in my face, beer bottles that slit my eye open, almost burnt my hair ... cuz they threw fire crackers on stage,"" she wrote. The witness, who was standing in the rear of the stage, said the crowd of about 2,000 was immediately angry toward Tequila and she was unable to turn them around. ""She was taunting them,"" he said. ""She didn't know how to handle them. She didn't understand the dynamic."" The rocks and bottles flew harder and faster when Tequila bared her breasts, he said. ""She took her top off and they got really violent,"" he said. Tequila continued to perform even after her face started bleeding, he said. ""She was holding a towel to her head, blood pouring down her face,"" he said. ""It was scary as hell!"" Tequila wrote. This was not  the only violent incident at the festival early Saturday, Seiner said.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- The next time a married man or woman glances your way, you might think twice before acting on impulse and frolicking between satin sheets. The scorned spouse could sue you. Yes, you read that right. You, the paramour, can get hit with a lawsuit that could cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars. They're known as ""alienation of affection"" suits, when an ""outsider"" interferes in a marriage. The suits are allowed in seven states: Hawaii, Illinois, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota and Utah. The law allowing such legal action dates back to antiquated times when a wife was considered the property of a husband. A broken-hearted hubby could go after his wife's lover -- not with a gun, but with the law. In modern times, the suits are filed for two reasons: money and revenge. Juries in North Carolina have handed out awards in excess of $1 million on multiple occasions. ""If your spouse is going to cheat, you really would like them to cheat with somebody who has a lot of money,"" says Lee Rosen, a North Carolina divorce attorney who deals with alienation of affection cases on a daily basis. And that's why many legal experts are paying close attention to the Tiger Woods saga. Will his wife go after an alleged mistress? Were any of his ""transgressions"" with someone who is married? If so, the jilted hubby might be able to go after the world's richest golfer. It doesn't matter that Woods lives in Florida, a state where the suits aren't allowed, legal experts say. If any of Woods' professed ""sins"" took place in an alienation of affection state, look out. ""If he had been dating a married woman, there could be the potential for a lucrative recovery,"" Rosen says. ""You've got to have a really affluent paramour that makes for a good target."" The suits rarely make it to trial. Usually, just the threat of such a lawsuit is enough for an out-of-court settlement. Click through a gallery of famous sex scandals . ""When folks are getting divorced, the threat of having the person's new boyfriend, girlfriend, husband or wife dragged into court and the dirty laundry aired ... causes enormous pressure,"" says Matt Steffey, a law professor at Mississippi College School of Law. Mississippi has been rocked by a high-profile suit, filed this summer, involving everything from allegations of ski resort trysts to a secret journal ordered kept under seal by a judge. Better yet, it involves a congressman who once co-sponsored legislation for President George W. Bush to declare 2008 the ""National Year of the Bible."" The son of a prominent federal judge in Mississippi, Chip Pickering was the rising GOP star of the state -- hand-picked to succeed Trent Lott in the U.S. Senate. Then, everything unraveled. Pickering decided not to run for re-election in 2008 after 12 years in the House. At the time, he said he wanted to spend more time with his family. He's married with five children. Like a tale from William Faulkner, who penned many a book on Mississippi elite with personal flaws, Pickering's tumble has been staggering. ""Chip Pickering has fallen far faster than the surrender of Vicksburg,"" Steffey says, referring to a key turning point in the Civil War, when Confederates gave up the Mississippi River town. The real doozy came July 14, when Leisha Pickering filed the alienation of affection suit against her husband's alleged lover, a socialite named Elizabeth Creekmore-Byrd. ""As a direct and proximate result of the negligent, wrongful and reckless misconduct and behavior of Creekmore-Byrd with Pickering,"" the suit says, ""plaintiff has suffered damage to the affection and consortium with her husband."" So hush-hush is the case, lawyers on both sides have reached a confidential agreement to not discuss the case publicly. The suit, in effect, has branded the once-proud congressman with a Scarlet ""A."" ""He had certainly fallen from the pinnacle of his professional life and his public life, but it had not yet become a public disgrace,"" Steffey says. ""And what this lawsuit did is it turned a fall into a disgrace."" ""There's a particular cast of tragedy when people are undone, not by accidental misfortune, but by their own character defects."" Watch: Are men programmed to cheat? Most states have abolished alienation of affection lawsuits. Proponents in the holdout states say the threat of such legal action helps protect the sanctity of marriage. But, Steffey and Rosen say, alienation of affection suits do just the opposite: They result in already contentious divorces getting even more heated, and they leave behind a public trail of personal shortcomings and wild tales of infidelity. ""To allow these suits to go forward,"" Steffey says, ""is destructive to family life."" ""It's much like dropping a nuclear bomb on a family,"" Rosen says. ""It really does damage the relationship between spouses. If there are children involved, it's devastating for them."" It would require legislative action for states to change the law. And anyone who tries that in a conservative state could get painted as a pro-divorce lawmaker who holds cheaters less accountable. ""It's a very delicate matter legislatively,"" Steffey says. And as long as the law remains on the books, Rosen says, he'll keep busy: ""We have an obligation to pursue our clients' rights."" There is one way to avoid such suits: Respect marital vows.","Seven states allow for a scorned spouse to sue a paramour .

"Washington (CNN) -- It may be the most overlooked mega-bill of the past 12 months. The nearly $1 trillion farm bill received final approval on Tuesday from the Senate, which sent the compromise already passed by the House to President Barack Obama to be signed into law. While it's called the farm bill, in truth, it's more of a food bill. It sets five years of eating and farming policy in the United States, including what we grow, what you know about your dinner and how much government spends in the process. It cuts the food stamp program and increases spending on farmers markets. Whatever you think of Congress, this is a bill that deserves some attention. Wal-Mart: Food stamp cuts to hit profits . Here's five lesser-known things the farm bill could mean to you: . 1. You will know a lot more about your meat: How much do you know about the chicken breast you just bought? Or that ribeye? This farm bill marks a major decision in the fierce fight over product labeling, by backing a new requirement that pork, chicken or beef sold in the United States must include details on where the animal was born, slaughtered and processed. Take a look at a package of meat in the store tonight and you'll see it. That information has been on labels since the fall. But Canadian and Mexican meat producers have fought the new U.S. labeling rule in world courts and furiously tried to have it reversed by the farm bill. In the final days of negotiations, lawmakers decided to keep the meat labeling rule. So if your meat is from the U.S. or if it was ever handled in Mexico, Canada or Australia, you'll know. 2. Farmers will see less risk; federal government takes on more: The bill dramatically changes 82 years of agricultural subsidies, ending guaranteed payments that farmers receive regardless of their harvest quality or crop prices. But, because those ""direct payments"" have been in place for generations, many farm values became based on the expectation of government dollars. Ending them could have wide-ranging effects. To try and mitigate the hit, the farm bill beefs up a different kind of subsidy -- a subsidy for crop insurance. This is complex, but in short, the government will make crop insurance cheaper and it will pay out some benefits at lower levels than previously. That will make farming less risky for some. But it transfers that risk to the federal government, which could be even more on tap if crop prices plummet or if a disaster hits. Good for farmers, risky for the deficit. 3. Lawmakers aren't disclosing something: Just like any farmer, members of Congress who own farmland can receive the crop insurance subsidies we talked about above. This can significantly cut premiums and save a bundle of money. The Republican House initially thought it was a good idea to know who in Congress would benefit from those subsidies and the original version of the bill included a requirement that lawmakers disclose if they or anyone in their immediate family receive the government help. But the Senate did not include the provision and in the end the House and Senate agreed to drop it. Lawmakers could have opted for a higher standard of transparency either for themselves or for everyone receiving these subsidies, but instead the public will have no way of discovering where this money flows. Bill trims $90 a month from food stamps . 4. We have land problems: The race to scoop up recent farming profits, especially in corn, has led to increased plowing of virgin lands in the United States. At the same time, rural areas face more soil erosion and other issues from land that has been worked for generations. The farm bill does something new on both issues. It forces farmers who want subsidies to follow a series of conservation practices. And it aims to protect more prairie land by cutting subsidies in half for people who farm on some virgin sod. Environmentalists have applauded the provisions, but aren't doing back flips. They note that the bill cuts direct spending on government conservation programs overall. 5. What goes in your body -- corn and sushi: The farm bill decides which crops the U.S. government wants to encourage or protect. It gives incentives to grow more of them. The most subsidized crops in this (and in most farm bills of the past) are the so-called ""row crops,"" things like wheat, soy, and the king of American agriculture, corn. These subsidies are one reason corn will remain one of the country's most reliable sources of food, from cattle feed to soda sweetener. The green and yellow vegetable will be a major part of your life for the foreseeable future. At the same time, this bill adds a few new winners to the list of subsidized row crops, among them sushi rice. If sushi rice prices fall too low, the government will now make up the difference. The possible result of that? More farmers will consider planting the crop. And there will likely be more American sushi rice to go around.","NEW: The Senate passes the nearly $1 trillion farm bill on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- What personal information does your mobile phone reveal about you? Do you care? Many Americans do, according to new research from the Pew Internet and American Life Project that sheds some light on mobile-privacy concerns. According to Pew's report, 54% of cell phone users in the U.S. have decided not to install an app once they discovered how much of their personal information it would access. (The amount of sensitive info an app can access typically is indicated by the ""permissions"" the app requests, listed on its information page.) Also, nearly one-third of mobile app users report uninstalling an app from their phone because they learned it was collecting personal information they didn't wish to share. People from the lowest-income households (earning $30,000 or less per year) and men across all demographics were most likely to report taking this step. But many mobile-privacy concerns stem not from the apps you download, but from what can happen with a device that can divulge so much sensitive information once it's out of your hands -- especially when it's in someone else's hands. Most cell phone users are somewhat aware of mobile privacy and many take at least some basic measures to protect it. According to Pew: . • 41% of cell phone owners back up at least the photos, contacts, and other files from their phone. • 32% have cleared their phone's Web browsing or search history. • 30% of all cell phone owners (and 60% of smartphone owners) say they back up the entire contents of their phone (apps, data, files, etc.) • 19% (especially younger phone owners) have turned off their phone's location-tracking feature due to concerns that companies or other people might access that information. Of course, regardless of whether you turn off location tracking on your phone, your wireless carrier knows (and keeps a record of) where your phone is at all times it's connected to the cell network. Carriers can surrender this information to law enforcement, and it's unclear what else they may be doing with this data. But typically, most people don't think clearly or consistently about mobile privacy. That's why, at the mobile technology workshops I often run, one of my favorite exercises is this: I simply tell participants to take out their cell phone, look at it, and consider how much important and sensitive information is on that device, how much they depend on it. Then I say: Hand over your cell phone to the person sitting next to you. I let them sit there a bit, watching them grow visibly anxious. About 30 seconds later I ask them them how they feel. ""Nervous"" is a common response. So are ""exposed,"" ""weird"" and ""scared."" ""OK, hand back those phones,"" I say. ""Now you see -- these aren't just gadgets, they're part of your life. They're part of you."" According to Pew, nearly a third of cell owners have lost their phones or had them stolen. Owners of smartphones and more basic phones are equally likely to say their phone has been lost or stolen, the survey says. When your phone is lost or stolen, it can help if you don't totally lose access to everything you had on the device. About 60% of smartphone owners told Pew that they back up the contents of their phone. Still, having a phone go missing doesn't necessarily make cell phone users more cautious. Pew noted: ""Cell owners who have actually experienced a lost or stolen phone are no more likely than average to back up the contents of their phone."" Routinely protecting your phone with a passcode or pattern is an easy way to prevent unauthorized access to your phone. Many mobile security services also offer location tracking for lost phones, and give you the option of remotely locking or wiping data from a lost or stolen phone. Cell phone snooping is also a concern. Pew reports that 12% of all U.S. cell phone owners ""have had another person access the contents of their phone in a way that made them feel their privacy was invaded."" Smartphone owners and younger owners (age 18-24) of any kind of cell phone are twice as likely to have had this experience. Of people who told Pew that someone accessed the contents of their phone without their permission, nearly 60% are ""much more likely than average to conduct regular backups,"" compared to just 39% of those whose phones have not been snooped. At least, not as far as they know. Pew's results came from a nationwide survey of 2,254 adults conducted in March and April. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of Amy Gahran.","New research from Pew sheds light on mobile-privacy concerns .

"(CNN) -- Street art has forever been a vibrant tool of personal expression manifesting in a variety of unique ways. In Africa it comes in the form of beautifully painted shop fronts, alternative methods of political campaigning and striking murals designed to inspire. To celebrate the best of African street art, CNN iReport asked for your submissions of the beautiful, political, or just plain fun. Back in the 1970s it was a gritty subculture associated with the streets of New York City, but these days the underground art of spray can graffiti can be found around the world, and Africa is no exception. Mozambican rapper Shot B submitted some of his work to iReport from around the capital city of Maputo. For him, being a street artist -- in addition to his musical exploits -- helps him share his voice with the local community . ""This wall is working as a sketchbook ... Street is a space that I feel people can learn, and people can meet art and so that's what motivates me,"" he said. Watch: Rapper turns to street artist . ""I love doing graffiti because I think that's something straight related with me. I got love for the streets. I got love for spray cans."" The legitimacy of graffiti has been an ongoing discourse in developed nations for several years thanks to the rise in popularity of anonymous guerrilla artists like Banksy and Invader. Similarly to Shot B, striking work by South African graffiti artist FALKO1 can be found on walls in and around Cape Town. Much of his work incorporates the design quirks of the building he is working on, to the effect that it often seems to have evolved with the building itself. ""I've been a graffiti artist with a strong traditional Hip-Hop influence since 1988,"" he said to CNN iReport. ""I don't really consider myself a street artist but a graffiti artist/writer who dabbles in 'street art'."" Many rappers like Shot B and FALKO1 use graffiti as an extension of their Hip Hop-inspired expression. But street art is also providing others with a political voice. While traveling through Morocco, iReporter Julee Khoo stumbled across a series of partisan murals. Intrigued by the designs, Khoo reached out to Moroccan colleagues who informed her that each local party is given public wall space to present campaign pledges, usually through election posters. ""Some parties have iconic symbols that represent them, so instead of posters, they use spray paint and stencils to paint the image of their party's symbol on the wall,"" she explained. She added: ""It's a much simpler, yet less wasteful, greener way to distribute campaign information. The wall also enables parties to interact with the illiterate members of the population. ""I can appreciate the value in having a symbol representing a party so someone who cannot read can simply pick out the identical symbol on the ballot in order to cast their vote -- makes the voting process a more accessible one."" Meanwhile in Gambia, local communities are using street art as a way of presenting their culture. Rimon Guimaraes, an iReporter from Brazil, captured a remarkable mural on a school faÃ§ade in Kubuneh. Created by his friend Noha, the mural is part of a larger body of work from the Wide Open Walls project, which aims to bring resident artists together to celebrate the Gambian communities while encouraging tourism in the region. ""I believe that the culture of Africans inspire artists of all the times,"" he said. ""Modiglianni and Picasso are some examples of African influence in the art world."" In Nigeria, iReporter Edidiong Uwemakpan captured a stunning mural on the side of the Orange Academy offices, a brand advertising college in Lagos, Nigeria. Created by local artist Kimson, the piece was commissioned by the college in the hopes of inspiring students by featuring several Nigerian personalities including musician and rights activist Fela Kuti. ""I like the fact that the artwork was done on the first floor of the building and the outer fence,"" he said. ""Together it told a story of liberation of the mind, of freedom, of standing for what you love and succeeding."" CNN's Mark Tutton and Sarah Brown contributed to this report.","African street art includes graffiti, inspiring murals, painted shop fronts .

"(CNN) -- The FBI is analyzing an audio recording that might give more clues about Michael Brown's shooting. Federal investigators have obtained the audio and are questioning the man who says he inadvertently recorded audio of gunfire at the time Brown was shot by Ferguson, Missouri, police on August 9, the man's attorney told CNN. It could be the newest piece in the larger puzzle of exactly what happened in the moments before the 18-year-old's death. The man, who wants to remain anonymous, was talking to someone on a video chat service and happened to record the conversation, his attorney Lopa Blumenthal said. A quick series of shots can be heard on the recording, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots. ""At the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building,"" said Blumenthal. The man lives near the site of the shooting and was close enough to have heard the gunshots, she said. Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four. ""I was very concerned about that pause ... because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired,"" Blumenthal told CNN's Don Lemon. ""And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up."" She said she learned of the recording late last week from a mutual friend. ""I had to get his consent before I could reach out to the FBI,"" Blumenthal said. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording. The meaning of the pause . It's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports. Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots. ""It's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon,"" said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell. Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer. But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer. ""To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,"" said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" ""Maybe the officer will say, 'Well, I fired and he kept advancing, so I fired again.' "" Witnesses and a friend of Officer Darren Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led up to Brown's death. Dueling narratives in Michael Brown shooting . Dorian Johnson, who was walking with Brown at the time of the shooting, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away. According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting. But a woman who identified herself as a friend of Wilson called in to a St. Louis radio show last week with what she said was the officer's version of events. The caller, who identified herself only as ""Josie,"" said Brown taunted the officer and charged at him. Her account matches what Wilson has told investigators, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN. An autopsy showed Brown had six gunshot wounds, all in the front of his body. Will autopsy shed any light on what happened? Key witness speaks out . Ferguson police said Brown allegedly robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting. And reports that his friend Johnson had a criminal record that includes lying to police has put Johnson's credibility in question. In 2011, Johnson was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name, age and address. Johnson said Monday night he doesn't understand why some are questioning his credibility. ""I see they bring up my past, my history, but it's not like it's a long rap sheet,"" Johnson told Lemon. ""This one incident shouldn't make me a bad person.""

"(CNN) -- Parents often ask me whether spanking is really so bad. After all, they were spanked as kids and they turned out fine. Plus, it's the only thing that will get their child to listen, they say. Much research has focused on the effects that severe child abuse can have on a person's mental well-being. But a new study published in the July issue of the journal Pediatrics takes a look at the possible link between mental health disorders and harsh physical punishment in the absence of abuse. The findings may persuade parents not to spank at all. Researchers from Canada found that physical punishment (such as slapping, hitting, pushing and shoving) -- even without child neglect or physical, sexual or emotional abuse -- was linked to mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance abuse and personality disorders. When does spanking become abuse? While it may be true that many of today's parents were spanked as children and are now well-adjusted, previous studies have also shown that those who were spanked are at a higher risk to be depressed; use alcohol; hit their spouse or own children; and engage in violent or criminal behaviors. Physical punishment doesn't help, it hurts . The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Canadian Paediatric Society discourage spanking and other forms of physical punishment. It is unlawful in 32 countries -- not including the United States or Canada -- for parents and other caregivers to use physical punishment against children. The new study's lead author, Tracie Afifi, said she believes that physical punishment should not be used on children of any age and that positive parenting strategies should instead be encouraged. Preferred methods of discipline do not include physical punishment. For example, withholding privileges, using time-outs and offering consequences (for example, ""If you throw your toy and it breaks, you won't be able to play with it anymore""). African-Americans most likely to use physical punishment . Dr. Howard Bennett, a pediatrician in Washington and clinical professor of pediatrics at George Washington University School of Medicine, recommends praising children when they are behaving well and using time-outs or a process called ""time off,"" in which the child must go to another part of the house for as long as it takes to stop the offending behavior and behave normally again. What are your thoughts on spanking? If you are a parent who uses spanking for discipline, will this study change your mind? Where do you draw the line between physical discipline and abuse? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Jennifer Shu.","Study looks at link between mental health disorders and physical punishment .

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) -- The polls are tight, the ads are flooding the airwaves, the harsh rhetoric is rising, and the surrogates are stumping hard all over the state. There is one ""X-factor"" that will put one of the Iowa Senate candidates over the top: Good, old-fashioned door-knocking -- except, it's not old-fashion anymore. Political door knocking is now a data-driven operation, making it as critical a piece of high tech campaign strategies as the endless fundraising solicitations delivered daily to supporters' inboxes. Canvassers only go to targeted households identified by algorithms using early voting/absentee voting data, party registration, voting history, and other micro-targeting information that create a stronger profile of a person or household's likelihood to vote for their own candidates. The practice could be the major deciding factor here in one of the country's closest Senate races and whether it goes to Democratic Congressman Bruce Braley or Republican State Sen. Joni Ernst, and whether Democrats can maintain control the Senate itself. But these volunteers aren't just trying to get voters for Election Day. They want to build their lead with early voting before polls open on Tuesday. ""The big advantage for the party, from the party's perspective, is we don't have to employ resources on the day of -- on Election Day -- to get out the vote because we know you've already voted. And you won't get any calls either,"" Democrat Scott Marron explained to a voter who called himself ""a Braley guy"" while canvassing a quiet Des Moines neighborhood. Iowa Democrats traditionally dominate this area, giving them a significant lead. Republicans say this year they have the competitive edge. In 2012,65,000 more registered Democrats voted absentee than registered Republicans. On Election Day, Republicans out-voted Democrats by over 20,000, but it wasn't enough to stop the Hawkeye state from giving President Barack Obama an important win during his reelection bid. Recognizing how detrimental this and other statewide losses were, local campaigns, the state party, and national Republicans combined efforts, including employing a smartphone app called ""Advantage"" to increase accuracy and productivity of door knocking this year. ""It's a much more efficient, much more personal way for people to connect with their neighbors and get the vote out,"" Iowa communications director Michael Brickman told CNN. ""In years past the early voting especially was a huge Democratic advantage; we realized we needed to do something to help catch up."" Republican volunteers walk in groups of two or three, with one person solely dedicated to updating the app and directing the others towards houses with information on who lives there, biographical data and voting status. If the person is home and a conversation is had (so far, no technology to improve that), they immediately update the app based on the talk that's transmitted to the party in real time, who can change their models and update their current map of houses before they even knock on the next door. Democrats use similar data to target voters but still use clipboards, known as ""turf packs"" to write down responses and input them later into a computer. Both campaigns say their strategies are fueling their eventual win. Democrats insist that instead of focusing on getting out their base who votes consistently, they are trying to turnout ""sporadic"" voters, or people who don't normally vote in a midterm election. ""Our strategy this year is to expand the electorate. For us that means turning out non-traditional voters,"" said Christina Freundlich, communications director of the Iowa Democratic Party. ""We right now are leading with these nontraditional voters by 14,000 votes. These 14,000 extra votes... represent over 1% of the expected final electorate."" Republicans disagree, saying their share of absentee voters have grown, while the Democrats' share is shrinking. They maintain Democrats have more unreturned ballots than Republicans. ""We're seeing success like never before. Democrats are usually up by tens of thousands of votes,"" Brickman said. He pointed to the over 15,000 absentee vote advantage they had in 2010, ""which we all know was a good year for Republicans ... Democrats simply aren't getting those numbers this time around."" Every day, the Iowa Secretary of State publicly releases data with absentee voting numbers. The campaigns, and other entities that have requested them, receive more detailed reports with names, voter ID numbers, and voting status (those who have requested ballots and returned them, as well as those who have voted early). The campaigns then crunch this data and update their models to target potential voters. This filters through to turf reports and app, arming canvassers with the best intelligence available. These tactics are working. Over 345,000 absentee votes have been cast so far in this election, according to the Iowa Secretary of State's office. That's about 50,000 more than this point of the 2010 midterm elections. The candidates are doing their part in a more traditional way, encouraging their supporters at every stop to take part. ""I need you. I need you to go out and vote, I need you to call a friend, I need you to talk to a neighbor and tell them why you're supporting me in this election and make sure they get out and vote,"" Ernst told supporters in Tuskaloosa, echoing the same message from her previous stops. ""I can't do it alone."" Both clearly understand the data and how to apply it effectively. ""We need you to keep knocking on doors, get those absentee ballots returned,"" Braley implored volunteers in Dubuque. ""I'm counting on you to get across the finish line.""","Door-knocking is still playing a role in the campaign for Iowa's open Senate seat .

"(CNN) -- Hopes soared recently when the Nigerian government said it had reached a deal with the terrorist group Boko Haram to free more than 200 girls and young women still missing after a mass abduction in April. But with each passing day, it looks less and less likely that the girls will be freed. In fact, Boko Haram has kidnapped numerous other young people in at least two incidents that have happened since the Nigerian government reported a deal. Boko Haram kidnaps 30 in northeast Nigeria . What's going on? Who and what is Boko Haram? The name ""Boko Haram"" translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language. The group has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. The group was founded 12 years ago by charismatic cleric Mohammed Yusuf. Police killed him in 2009 in an incident captured on video and posted to the Internet. Boko Haram is now led by Abubakar Shekau. In recent years, its attacks have intensified in an apparent show of defiance amid the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the Nigerian government. The militant group has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike. What was agreed upon in the ceasefire deal? Nigerian officials said on October 16 that President Goodluck Jonathan's government had reached a ceasefire agreement with Boko Haram after a month of negotiations. But officials provided few details about the release. Doyin Okupe, a government spokesman, did not specify when the girls would be freed. He said not all would be let go at once, but a ""significant number"" would be released soon. The Nigerian government had also consented to some demands by Boko Haram, but Okupe declined to provide details. Boko Haram has remained silent on the deal the government said it signed with the group in neighboring Chad last week. Nigerian officials have emphasized there is no set time line for release of the girls, which likely would happen on a piecemeal basis instead of all at once. So is there actually a deal? David Cook, who studies jihad, wrote on October 18 that he had doubts about a deal going through. ""It remains to be seen whether this truce will actually materialize, whether it is merely an election ploy for Nigeria's embattled President, Goodluck Jonathan, and most crucially whether it will bring about the release of numerous captives taken by Boko Haram during the past year,"" he wrote in an analysis for CNN. ""While Boko Haram has suffered some reverses during the recent past, there is no indication that the group has suffered any mortal damage. The most plausible interpretation of the truce is that it is a bought one (probably in tandem with the Cameroonian release of captives), and that Boko Haram is merely using it (assuming that it holds to the truce at all) as a respite in order to regroup."" In an article written for CNN the day after Nigeria announced the ceasefire, Brookings' Richard Joseph wrote: ""This is a case when we will actually need to see the girls emerging from their six-month confinement before we can truly believe."" What has Boko Haram done since Nigeria announced the truce? Boko Haram gunmen kidnapped at least 30 boys and girls from a village in northeast Nigeria during the weekend. Last week Boko Haram militia kidnapped 60 women and girls in two Christian villages in neighboring Adamawa state, according to residents and community leaders. The heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about $9, and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted Saturday, suggesting that they would be taken as sex slaves, residents told CNN. Then on Friday and Saturday, heavily armed Boko Haram gunmen invaded the town of Mafa in Borno state and seized 30 boys and girls, local leaders said. ""They took them away to their base in the bush, and we believe they are going to use them as foot soldiers,"" Mafa local government chairman Shettima Maina said. Mallam Ashiekh Mustapha, the local chief of Mafa who confirmed the abductions, said the kidnappers also stole 300 cows from the farming community in the raid. The Nigerian government has said Boko Haram has denied involvement in the kidnappings, but the group has issued no public statement on the issue. Are Boko Haram and Nigeria's government really interested in peace? Richard Joseph argues that ""the campaign for the Nigerian presidency has effectively merged with the campaign to defeat Boko Haram."" ""If the government is successful in brokering a lasting ceasefire with Boko Haram and bringing home these girls, Goodluck Jonathan would undoubtedly get a significant boost in his reelection efforts."" In July last year, Professor of African History and Peace Studies at the University of Ibadan Isaac Olawale Albert wrote an opinion piece for CNN in which he argued that Boko Haram had no reason to pursue peace. ""Leader Abubakar Shekau and some of the group's other senior members have nothing to gain from any permanent peace -- especially as the international community has already cast them in the mold of former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. As they await eventual capture, they will not mind causing more trouble,"" Albert said. Director of the Royal African Society Richard Dowden noted in May that President Jonathan had not commented on the schoolgirls' abduction for two weeks after the incident. The reason, Dowden argued, was that the problems of the northeast region did not matter to his government as there was no incentive to develop the region. ""It produces nothing and will not vote for President Jonathan,"" he wrote. Why did Boko Haram abduct the girls? Shehu Sani, a human rights activist in northern Nigeria who has previously been involved in mediating with Boko Haram, told CNN in May that the mass April abduction and other recent attacks were messages to the Nigerian government that the recent arrest of Boko Haram followers in Islamic schools will be avenged. In 2012, Shekau's wife and three children were reportedly taken into military custody. Sani said he believed Boko Haram targeted the girls to force concessions from the Nigerian government -- beginning perhaps with the release of Boko Haram followers from prisons. ""The fact Shekau said he would sell the girls and did not say he would kill them is a clear indication that negotiation is possible,"" he said. But at least some of them may be traded for ransom money. Boko Haram has begun trading hostages for cash -- most notably in the case of a French family kidnapped in northern Cameroon last year and reportedly freed for some $3 million. The international outrage sparked by the abduction also serves Shekau. ""It has put pressure on the government to reach out to him,"" Sani said . Has Boko Haram negotiated before? Shekau is not beyond negotiating with the Nigerian government, despite his apocalyptic rhetoric and frequent denials of President Goodluck Jonathan's legitimacy. According to the International Crisis Group, negotiations in Ivory Coast a year ago were on the verge of producing ""an apparent peace agreement that was to begin with a ceasefire."" Then Shekau was designated a terrorist by the U.S. State Department and abandoned the talks. What are the chances of the girls' safe return? Jacob Zenn, an expert on Boko Haram with the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington-based research and analysis firm, said in May that the mass kidnapping may have been part of an effort by Shekau to reinforce the loyalty of largely uneducated recruits by providing them with ""free servants or sex slaves."" ""Many will likely end up becoming mothers -- it's a real horror and over the next years we'll slowly hear the stories of girls few-by-few as they manage to make it out,"" Zenn told CNN. ""Boko Haram has likely split up or sold the girls into many small groups,"" and they can be used as human shields in the event of an attack, he said. However, if the ceasefire announcement is real, it would appear the girls are alive, leaving hope for the chance of their return.","Ceasefire between Nigeria and Boko Haram raised hopes for release of kidnapped girls .
Militants have continued their kidnappings even after the deal was reached .
Some experts doubt that the ceasefire will go through .
Others say negotiated release is still possible ."
"(CNN) -- An Arkansas woman, who lost her baby last month after coming down with the H1N1 flu virus, has now lost her life. Leslie Creekmore, 29, had been hospitalized for the last month. She was put on a ventilator January 13, before being rushed to a St. Louis hospital a day later. Creekmore spontaneously miscarried on January 16. She was 20 weeks pregnant. ""She's gone now, and the universe itself is lesser for the loss,"" her husband Chris Creekmore said in a post to the Facebook group ""Love for Leslie."" ""I loved her with every iota of my being and beyond, and I have no intention of that changing just because she isn't here with me corporeally."" On the advice of their doctor, the couple said they postponed getting a flu shot until after Creekmore's first trimester. The couple did not know that his guidance was counter to federal health recommendations. Creekmore had planned to get a flu shot at a clinic on January 13 -- the same day she was put on a ventilator. CDC recommendation . Any pregnant woman should get a flu shot to protect against serious complications as soon as the yearly vaccine becomes available in her area, advises the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website flu.gov. Women can receive the flu shot at any point during their pregnancies, regardless of trimester, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports the CDC recommendation that all women get vaccinated if they will be pregnant during the influenza season: ""Vaccination early in the season and regardless of gestational age is optimal,"" ACOG says. No harm has been demonstrated to pregnant women or their babies as a result of the vaccine, the CDC said. The flu vaccine protects against many strains during the season from October to March. Pregnant women who receive the vaccine may still get the flu, but it would likely be a milder illness than otherwise, and severe consequences would be improbable, Gray-Swain said. A national effort to prevent the 2009 H1N1 pandemic flu has contributed to a dramatic increase in the number of pregnant women who receive flu vaccines, according to the CDC. Less than 15% of pregnant women received a flu shot before 2009; in the next two seasons, more than half of pregnant women got the vaccine protection. The risks of not getting a flu shot . The flu may increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth and low birth weight, the CDC said. ""Pregnancy puts extra stress on your heart and lungs. Pregnancy can also affect your immune system. These factors increase the risk of becoming severely ill due to the flu,"" according to the CDC website. Life-threatening developments like Creekmore's in flu patients are generally rare but not unheard of, Gray-Swain said. ""Pregnant women are five times more likely to end up in the ICU or have severe complications related to the flu than non-pregnant women who get infected with the flu,"" she said.

If you are pregnant, inform the health care staff administering the vaccine before you receive it. Washing your hands after using the bathroom, touching public surfaces and other activities is also important, she said. Pregnant women can also take a drug called Tamiflu.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- A woman sunbathing on a boat died after a stingray leaped from the water off the Florida Keys on Thursday and struck her, officials said. The dead stingray lies on the deck of a boat in Florida. ""It's just as freakish of an accident as I have heard,"" said Jorge Pino of Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. ""The chances of this occurring are so remote that most of us are completely astonished that this happened."" He said it was not clear whether the 55-year-old Michigan woman died from the blow to her head, from the ray's barb piercing her or from her fall backward. The accident happened off the coast of Marathon Key, in the Florida Keys about an hour's drive south of Miami. The woman, who was with her husband and children, was taken to the Mariner Hospital in Tavernier, where she was pronounced dead. Pino said he had seen stingrays leap into the air, but added, ""it's very rare for them to collide with objects."" Results from an autopsy to be conducted by the medical examiner will be combined with witness statements and evidence from aboard the vessel to determine the cause of death, he said. The spotted eagle ray weighed about 75 pounds, said Becky Herrin, a spokeswoman for the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. The species, also called a leopard ray or bonnet skate, can measure up to 8 feet in length, with an 8-foot tail, and weigh up to 500 pounds, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History's Web site. They tend to swim close to the surface and can leap out of the water when being pursued, according to the site.

"(CNN) -- New Delhi strains under the weight of its own UNESCO World Heritage sites. What with the towering minaret of Qutb Minar, the glorious Humayun's tomb and the imposing Red Fort Mughal palace, visitors can feel swamped by the sheer abundance of history on display. But India's capital city provides more than just awe-inspiring spectacles of its ancient past. With a preponderance of market stalls, bazaars, shopping malls and street vendors, New Delhi is a consumer paradise, lending a much-needed retail counterpoint to all that earnest sightseeing. To help you separate the glad rags from the plain old rags, here's CNN's at-glance-guide to shopping your way through New Delhi. Before you start . If the city is just one port of call on an India-wide shopping spree (with a few sights thrown in for good measure), bear in mind that you can arrange for most things -- large or small -- to be shipped back, so that it's waiting patiently on your doorstep when you return home. There are international couriers everywhere, and most hotels can help you arrange shipments for an almost disconcertingly small fee. Dilli Haat . For the most authentic and down-to-earth shopping experience head to ""Dilli Haat"" in south-west Delhi. Modeled around a traditional rural marketplace (a ""haat""), it features some 200 individual stalls that form a permanent al-fresco arts-and-crafts bazaar. This is a great place to buy original hand-made items directly from the producers themselves, with artisans from across the country selling everything from panel-beaten silver jewelry to brightly colored linens and vast decorative ornaments. Be aware, the stalls operate on a rotating basis -- so, if you see something you like, buy it on sight, as the vendor may have disappeared by tomorrow. Dilli Haat is not for the hesitant consumer and haggling the best price is standard practice. Crafts Museum . Those keen to combine consumer therapy with a bit of heritage should wander over to the National Handicrafts and Handlooms Museum -- one of the largest crafts museums in India. The 20,000 or so exhibits feature centuries-old textiles, rare metal works and intricately crafted clay pots. But the souvenir shop is almost equally as impressive, with ink drawings on parchment, handmade Himalayan shawls, mirrored fabrics and many other quintessentially Indian arts and crafts available for purchase. In addition, there are often live demonstrations by craftsmen, whose wares go on sale hot off the production line. Read related: New fashions inspired by New Delhi . Sarojini Nagar Market . A pilgrimage site for bargain-hunting fashionistas, the Sarojini Nagar Market stocks all the latest couture designs before they hit European and American boutiques with eye-popping mark-ups. Export surpluses and last-minute canceled lines are dumped here en-masse, so check for holes, faulty zips, stains and missing buttons before handing over your cash. There are no changing rooms as it's not much more than a long road with make-shift shops on both sides. That said, prices are so low that buyer's remorse is a rare experience, with entire wardrobes bought for less than the price of a few beers. State Government Emporiums . If you're fearful of tourist traps and you're just not the haggling type, then the government-run emporiums dotted across the capital offer fixed pricing and quality-assured ""India PLC"" produce. Each emporium tends to have its own specialism, showcasing products from different states. For instance, head to Himachal for blankets and shawls; Tamil Nadu for sandalwood products; Uttar Pradesh Emporium for the incredible stone-inlay work popularized by the Taj, as well as copper, brasswork and leather items; Kashmir Emporium is the place for carpets; and Orissa for fabrics and traditional paintings. If you've only time for one, however, then the Central Cottage Industries Emporium Central Cottage Industries Emporium is the place to go. -- a six-storey Aladdin's cave selling everything from giant ornamental Gods to packets of exquisitely scented Darjeeling tea. Khan market . If the rag-tag pandemonium of New Delhi's more traditional bazaars and market stalls is taking its toll, or you hanker for the sight of some familiar shops, then the row of upscale designer boutiques, cosmetic outlets and chain stores in Khan Market will be just the ticket. With the ex-pat market in mind (the diplomatic enclave is a stone's throw away) the shops here offer home-sick holiday makers the reassurance of popular brands such as the Body Shop and Nike -- and there's even a Subway for the culinarily incurious. But this is also the place to pick up fine gourmet groceries -- such as Italian pesto and French baguettes -- that will otherwise be difficult to source in other parts of town. Beware, prices are sometimes more upmarket than the goods on offer. Chandni Chowk . No self-respecting shopper could visit New Delhi without taking the rickshaw ride down to Chandi Chowk, the old city's famously frenetic merchant district. Spilling over with shops peddling luminous candies, vividly-colored saris and shawls, homecare products, discount electrical goodies, and much, much else besides, this traffic-choked thoroughfare is worth a trip for the atmosphere alone. Haggling like your life depends on it is just part of the fun.","With a history that spans millennia, New Delhi is replete with ancient monuments and wonders of the world .
The city's bazaars and street vendors also make it a bargain-hunter's paradise.

"(CNN) -- Wondering where to go for your next holiday? Experts explain which destinations we should be checking out in 2014. Brazil: The World Cup . The modern game of football, or soccer, may have been born in England's public schools, but many will claim its soul has settled in Brazil. It has the world's most successful international team, winning the World Cup five times. It calls what many claim to be the world's greatest player, Pele, one of its own. And company managers and bosses are known to demand their employees skip work to watch the big games. The World Cup next year then, to be hosted over June and July in 18 cities across the country, is likely to be memorable, to say the least. Throw in the rest of the country, which includes rainforests, beaches and a party culture that makes most New Year's Eve soirees look decidedly po-faced, and you have the makings of an epic trip. Daisy Parker from ABTA (Association of British Travel Agents) suggests visiting some of the country's more remote areas. ""The Brazilians' love of a party is going to make it a must-visit long haul destination for 2014,"" she says. ""Once fans have flown that far we predict many will stay on to check out areas like the Amazon basin and the amazing Iguazu Falls. Brazil's beaches are also some of the best in the world."" Explore offers a 14-day Pure Brazil tour, which starts from $5,913 per person (not including flights). Panama: Canal's 100th birthday . The Panama Canal's 100-year anniversary arguably is not, in and of itself, a top five reason for visiting the country in 2014. But the events surrounding the big day and Panama's other attractions certainly are. ""August 2014 marks 100 years since the completion of the Panama Canal, and that's likely to attract more attention to the destination,"" says Mary Moses, general manager at PEAK South America. ""However, Panama has a lot more to offer travelers than just the canal -- volcanoes, rainforests, coffee plantations and beautiful beaches on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts."" Peregrine Adventures offers a 10-day Panama Highlights tour. Prices start from $2,171 per person (excluding flights). Myanmar: Tourism 'Master Plan' Myanmar has been touted as ""the next big tourism destination"" for a few years already, but getting around the country has proved tricky. ATMs have been absent or limited to locals only, the Internet was something nobody appeared to have heard of and travel was restricted to places the government was happy for you to see. That's started to change already, and next year it's going to accelerate. ""The Myanmar Ministry of Hotels and Tourism has prepared a 'Master Plan' and 'Responsible Tourism Policy' to map out the future of tourism in the country,"" says Professor Donald E. Hawkins, Eisenhower Professor of Tourism Policy at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. ""The goal in 2014 is to maximize tourism's contribution to national employment and income generation while ensuring the social and economic benefits of tourism are distributed equitably."" Explore offers a 14-day Myanmar highlights tour. Prices start from $2,324 per person (excluding flights). Lake Myvatn, Iceland: Best Northern Lights for years . ""With NASA scientists predicting that an 11-year cycle of solar activity will peak this winter, for the first few months of 2014 the Northern Lights are expected to put on their most spectacular display for the next decade,"" says David Phillips, operations manager for Explorers Astronomy Tours. ""Although a viewing of the aurora borealis can never be guaranteed, you can boost your chances by heading to the beautiful and more remote areas such as northern Iceland so that you are well away from light pollution."" Discover the World offers a range of Iceland-based tours, with prices starting from $329 per person (excluding flights). Ecuador: Becoming a 'tourism powerhouse' In the last few months Ecuador's new Minister of Tourism, Vinicio Alvarado, announced a $600 million investment in tourism over the next four years, a hike of more than 300%, as part of a plan to become a ""tourism powerhouse."" Earlier this year a new international airport opened in Quito. A new luxury train just started operations and the country continues to be the world's best place to retire, according to International Living. In short, it's probably the best vacation spot you haven't yet considered, unless your name's Julian Assange. ""Ecuador is evolving fast, and a visit to this Andean nation has never been more tempting,"" says Rough Guides editor Eleanor Aldridge. "" ""The re-launch of the Tren Crucero, a century-old railway between Guayaquil and Quito, garnered one of the British Guild of Travel Writers' top awards for 2013."" GA Adventures offers an eight-day Ecuador Quest tour. Prices start from $1,067 per person (excluding flights). New Zealand: 2,500-kilometer cycle trail . If doing more exercise is one your 2014 resolutions (and this time you mean it), an extended trip to New Zealand could provide the means. In 2014 the country will complete its enormous Nga Haerenga cycle trail, designed to showcase the best of the country's landscape, culture and heritage. The 2,500-kilometer network is made up of 23 shorter trails covering both the North and South islands, and the final two will be completed in January. The New Zealand government threw $50 million into the construction of these trails, which snake through lush rainforests, glacial-fed lakes and along old railway lines once used by miners during the Gold Rush. New Zealand-based tour operator Natural High offer a 17-day cycle tour from Auckland on the North Island to Christchurch on the South island. Prices start from $4,223 (excluding flights). Playas de Nosara, Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica: Officially approved beaches . If you're the type that likes awards and official stamps of approval before buying your vacation, the beaches in Nosara in Costa Rica just winked at you. They're likely to become popular in 2014, thanks to the recent award of a Blue Flag -- an international certification awarded to beaches that offer top quality and environmentally friendly experiences. Alvin Rosenbaum, an expert in tourism and senior visiting scholar at George Washington University's International Institute of Tourism Studies, says: ""Its pristine beaches are responsible for the introduction of an array of new activities for families with children, ranging from toddlers' programs to educational and volunteer programs for older children. ""Nosara prides itself on its beaches and wildlife refuges and is now one of the most environmentally-aware communities in Latin America."" Hands Up Holidays offers a 10-day Nicoya Explorer tour. Prices start from $3,745 per person (excluding flights). Japan: Brand new festivals . The 50th anniversary of the bullet train, several new festivals (in a country already in possession of some bizarre ones), a new luxurious cruise train called Seven Stars offering visitors a spectacular new way to explore the prefecture of Kyushu -- there are plenty of reasons to visit Japan in 2014. ""The first official International Cool Japan Awards and POP Matsuri (festival), will take place in Osaka between March 21 and 30, 2014,"" says Kylie Clark from the Japanese National Tourism Organisation. ""Categories will include manga, anime and gaming, and during the festival numerous events will be held throughout the city tied to Japanese pop culture."" Inside Japan Tours offers a 14-night Best of Japan tour. Prices start from $3,104 per person (excluding flights). East Africa: One visa, three countries . Spotting gorillas in Uganda and rhino in Kenya will become a less complicated affair in 2014 after changes to visa regulations come into effect. ""Visiting the mountain gorillas in Rwanda is a trip of a lifetime, but the magical experience itself lasts just one hour once you get up close to them,"" says Brad John-Davis, general manager for PEAK Africa. ""From January 1, travelers to East Africa will be able to visit Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda on a single visa, which will make it much easier to combine gorilla viewing with other incredible wildlife experiences across East Africa, such as tracking chimps in Uganda and spotting the big five in Uganda's Queen Elizabeth National Park."" Intrepid offers four-day gorilla safaris starting from $4,120 per person, excluding flights. San Sebastián, Spain: A future 'world's best city'? It's already tied in fifth place on one list of the world's best cities, and it's likely to get even more popular soon, as San Sebastián will be the European Capital of Culture in 2016. ""I think it's important to get there before the masses discover this destination,"" says Daniel Fesenmaier from Temple University's School of Tourism and Hospitality Management. ""It's next to France and some of the best wine regions, including Rioja, located just to the south, and Bordeaux in France, just to the north. The food is San Sebastián is also fantastic."" If you don't know what a pintxo is, or how it tastes, now's the time to find out. Intrepid Travel offers an eight-day Northern Spain Overview tour. Prices start from $2,543 per person (excluding flights). Tallinn, Estonia: Tunnels and Titanic meals . Tallinn's beautiful old town is reason any year to head to this under-visited city, but in 2014 its most popular tourist attraction will become significantly more accessible, thanks to plans to complete excavation of the tunnels beneath the famous bastion walls. The city also has a number of relatively new attractions, including the Lennusadam Seaplane Harbour Museum, where visitors can check out several seaplanes housed within spectacular hangars. The museum has recently opened a Titanic Artefact exhibition that examines the history of the doomed ship; in early 2014, the museum will host several gala dinners inspired by the last night in the first-class area of the ship. Baltic Tours offer a two-night city break in Tallinn. Prices start from $225 per person.","New Zealand government threw $50 million into the construction of the Nga Haerenga cycle trails .

"Charlottesville, Virginia (CNN) -- The man charged with the abduction of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham was also investigated for alleged sexual assault when he was in college over a decade ago. A ""criminal incident information"" report released Wednesday by Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, said the alleged incident involving Jesse Matthew took place on September 7, 2003. Matthew quit the school's football team five days later and left the school in mid-October. The university said federal student record privacy laws limited the amount of information it could provide publicly. ""The University is fully cooperating with law enforcement agencies,"" a statement said. ""The success of the criminal investigation is paramount at this time."" Where is Hannah Graham? Last person with Graham . Investigators believe Matthew, 32, was the last person with Graham, who was last seen September 13. He has been charged with abduction with the intent to defile in the case, and he is being held in jail in isolation, according to Charlottesville police. Authorities are offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the safe return of the 18-year-old, a second-year student at the university. More than 3,000 tips to Graham's possible whereabouts have poured in, Carter Johnson, a police spokesman, said. As part of the search effort, police have asked owners of large parcels of property in surrounding counties to search their land and report back. Hannah Graham disappearance: What we know . Aerial drone search . The search for Graham now includes the use of an aerial drone -- the first time, according to authorities, one has been used in the search for a missing person in the state. The addition of the drone to the search effort comes more than two weeks after Graham disappeared from an area of Charlottesville known as the Downtown Mall. The drone has a high-quality camera, and it will ""look closer"" at objects of interest, said John Coggin, chief engineer of the Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership and one of the members of the team operating the drone. The drone is expected to help with the search of vast tracts of land in the area. As the drone worked from overhead Wednesday, more than 50 law enforcement personnel participated in the search in Fairfax County. Authorities check unsolved cases for ties to Hannah Graham disappearance . 'New forensic link' The search of Wednesday also included U.S. 29, outside of Charlottesville, where another woman reportedly disappeared. The search follows reports that Virginia State Police found a ""new forensic link"" between the Graham case and the death of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, who went missing after attending a Metallica concert in Charlottesville in October 2009. Harrington was last seen hitchhiking along U.S. 29, and her remains were found on a farm months later. Almost from the start, speculation was raised about the possibility of a connection between Graham's disappearance and Harrington's death. No arrests have been made in Harrington's case, and the cause of her death is still under investigation. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Jason Morris, Ed Lavandera, Jean Casarez and journalist Betsy Kaufman contributed to this report.","Suspect Jesse Matthew was investigated for sexual assault while in college in 2003 .

"Omaha, Nebraska (CNN) -- Sen. Rand Paul kicks off a three-day swing Monday across Iowa, holding campaign-style events and fund-raisers with local politicians as the potential Republican presidential contender barnstorms the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Paul's route will take him through nine cities from the state's western border to its eastern edge. The Kentucky Republican will also help the state Republican Party open multiple offices ahead of the midterm elections. ""It's very important for Sen. Paul to hear the concerns of average Iowans as well as job creators,"" said Steve Grubbs, Paul's chief Iowa strategist and a longtime political operative in the Hawkeye State. As Paul lays the groundwork for a potential presidential campaign, he has kept Iowa a top priority. This is his fourth trip there since the 2012 presidential election. Paul will leave the state on Wednesday, a day before the start of the Iowa State Fair, a popular venue for presidential hopefuls. A small swarm of other potential GOP contenders will travel to Iowa this weekend to attend a popular event for social conservatives. But Paul won't be there, preferring to give the candidates he's been helping some breathing room and allow them to be the focus. Poll: Republicans slightly behind Clinton in key 2016 states . Tim Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa, said the senator's plan isn't a bad idea, especially in a midterm election year. ""You want to come in and do favors for Iowa politicians,"" he said. ""If you're at the state fair, the attention is on you and not the person you're trying to help."" ""Next year, you call in those favors,"" he added. ""That's how it works."" Paul actually starts the week in Omaha, Nebraska, where he'll appear publicly with Ben Sasse, the GOP nominee for Nebraska's open Senate seat. Then, he'll quickly hop across the state line to help the Iowa GOP open an office in Council Bluffs, where he's expected to appear with the state's GOP Senate nominee, Joni Ernst. Potential 2016 GOP candidates tout conservative principles in Iowa . Later Monday he travels north to Sioux City for another office opening, and then to a fund-raiser farther north, in Okoboji, for Rep. Steve King, a longtime congressman with considerable sway among the state's social conservatives. Tuesday morning Paul is back on the road for a fund-raiser in Clear Lake, before a stop at the Iowa GOP office in Hiawatha. Continuing east, he'll attend a fund-raiser for Mariannette Miller-Meeks' congressional campaign in Iowa City, and then he has two events in Davenport, including a tour of the corporate headquarters of Von Maur department stores. Wednesday he attends a breakfast in Urbandale and wraps up his public appearances for the week with another GOP office opening in the same city, a suburb of Des Moines. On some issues, Paul and Christie sound a lot alike . Paul's political action committee, RANDPAC, has made two big hires from Iowa in recent months: Grubbs -- who's also a former state representative and state party chairman -- and A.J. Spiker, a prominent figure among Iowa's libertarian-leaning Republicans. Paul's father, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, generated a huge following in Iowa during his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. The libertarian movement went on to gain sizable influence in the state's Republican Party after the election -- Spiker, for example, became state GOP chairman -- but mainstream Republicans took back control of the party earlier this year. A big question will be whether Rand Paul, who's considered more moderate than his father, can re-energize the so-called Liberty faction of the state party, while also garnering support from its social conservatives and mainstream Republicans. ""One of the reasons I signed on to work with Sen. Paul is I could see how he appeals to all of our party,"" Grubbs said. ""There are very few candidates who have that ability to unify our party. I think that he can do that.""","Rand Paul kicks off a three-day swing Monday across the first-in-the-nation caucus state .

"Washington (CNN) -- Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords is urging Arizona voters to supporter her successor, Rep. Ron Barber, who is locked in a tough race for re-election, with a personal video appeal. Giffords, who has been recovering since being seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting, speaks clearly into the camera as she says, ""We expect our leaders to fight for us, not the special interests. Ron Barber is independent, he's courageous, and most of all he's Arizona through and through."" This ad from the political action committee founded by Giffords -- Americans for Responsible Solutions -- follows some controversy about a previous ad from the same group attacking Barber's opponent, Republican Martha McSally. 5 House races to watch in 2014 . Barber is a former congressional aide to Giffords. They were both wounded in that same attack as she was greeting constituents. He won a special election to replace her after she resigned her seat in 2012 and then he was re-elected to a full term in 2012. The campaign for Arizona's 2nd Congressional District this year again pits Barber against McSally, a retired Air Force colonel. He barely beat her two years ago, and the 2014 race is rated a tossup by the nonpartisan Rothenberg and Cook political reports. This is the fourth ad in this contest from Americans for Responsible Solutions, which Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly formed to help push for stronger gun-control legislation, including more stringent background checks for purchases. Several of the group's previous spots went after McSally for not supporting closing a gap that allowed stalkers with misdemeanor convictions to buy guns but barring those convicted of felonies from such purposes. One of those spots became controversial for featuring a mother whose 19-year-old daughter was stalked and shot to death by her ex-boyfriend. In the wake of the ad, her campaign later said McSally would support new legislation preventing those convicted of a misdemeanor stalking crime from buying a gun and revealed she had been a victim of stalking earlier. Guns killing women: Time for Congress to act . The ad and the topic of how to deal with gun violence were featured in a debate between McSally and Barber on Tuesday. McSally said she was a proud supporter of the National Rifle Association, adding she wanted to make sure gun violence was minimized and ""is obviously addressed in our communities."" Then she added: ""We have different ways of talking about that. But the way that this has happened in this campaign has just been disgraceful. There were ads that were run by your allies that were considered vile and nasty by the Arizona Republic (newspaper)."" McSally pushed Barber over the stalking ad. He responded, ""The ad was not run by me, and I'm not going to talk about an ad that I didn't sponsor. But when you talk about allies, the ad was run by someone who is highly regarded in this community and across the country for her work to prevent gun violence and that's Gabby Giffords. But that aside, what my opponent has said is that she now accepts the notion that we should have misdemeanor stalkers prohibited from having a gun. The problem with her position is that she still refuses to say we should expand background checks."" Americans for Responsible Solutions says the cost of its new ad is ""a strong six-figure buy"" and will air for two weeks on broadcast, cable, and online. The controversial stalking ad is not the only creating some controversy in this election. The National Republican Congressional Committee this week started airing a spot attacking Barber by featuring some of Giffords' past positions, such as voting against former House Speaker and current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, as it tries to show Giffords was more independent than Barber is. Giffords released a statement saying: ""No organization or person -- no matter which party they say they represent -- should think they can come to Southern Arizona and pretend to speak for me ... I work hard to speak, but's my voice. So take it from me: Ron is an independent leader in Congress, and no one will fight harder for our community.""

"(CNN) -- Shia LaBeouf says he isn't famous anymore, but actually he's rarely been in a brighter spotlight. For the past several weeks, the 27-year-old actor has gotten more than his fair share of publicity thanks to a rash of bizarre behavior, from his reaction to allegations of plagiarism to his recent stunts at the Berlin Film Festival, where Lars von Trier's ""Nymphomaniac -- Volume 1"" premiered Sunday. At a news conference to promote the sexually explicit film, LaBeouf answered just one question before abruptly walking out of the room 10 minutes after the event began. According to reporters present in Berlin, LaBeouf was asked to describe what it's like to do a movie that includes so many sex scenes. In response, the former child star quoted French soccer player Eric Cantona: ""When the seagulls follow the trawler, it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea."" As the room tried to make sense of his answer, LaBeouf made his exit. And that was just the prelude. Later on at the ""Nymphomaniac"" premiere, LaBeouf showed up on the red carpet wearing a tuxedo and a paper bag over his head. As if that wasn't eye-catching enough, the mask, which was outfitted with two holes for his eyes, had ""I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE"" scrawled on it in black marker. To LaBeouf's fans, that line is all too familiar. He's tweeted the phrase, in all caps, every day since January 20. Making this situation even more curious are the series of events that led up to his ""NOT FAMOUS"" proclamation. In December, LaBeouf was hit with allegations that he plagiarized author Daniel Clowes' work for his short film, ""HowardCantour.com,"" and the actor soon copped to using Clowes' art without proper credit. ""I f****d up,"" he said at the time in a tweeted statement. ""In my excitement and naivetÃ© as an amateur filmmaker, I got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation ... I'm embarrassed that I failed to credit @danielclowes for his original graphic novella Justin M. Damiano, which served as my inspiration ... I was truly moved by his piece of work & I knew that it would make a poignant & relevant short. I apologize to all who assumed I wrote it."" A few days after that statement, however, LaBeouf started taking the concept to extremes. He began responding to the vitriol online with more plagiarism, borrowing from mea culpas by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, UK Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and even ""Nymphomaniac"" director von Trier. In January, LaBeouf literally took his apologies to a higher level, hiring an airplane to sky write ""I am sorry Daniel Clowes"" in Los Angeles. Before anyone could figure out what LaBeouf was really up to -- there were rumors that his strangeness was actually performance art -- he announced that he was retiring. ""In light of the recent attacks against my artistic integrity, I am retiring from all public life,"" he said on January 10. ""My love goes out to those who have supported me."" Of course, it appears that LaBeouf has a very different definition of what it means to be retired. Not only is the actor still as publicly visible as ever, but he's also still accepting movie roles.

"(CNN) -- One of the 12-year-olds charged with stabbing a friend to impress the fictional Internet bogeyman Slenderman was deemed incompetent to stand trial Friday -- at least for now -- according to court documents. After debate between prosecutors and the defense over whether a competency test would violate Morgan Geyser's rights, the judge asked the girl whether she was competent. ""Court finds the defendant is standing mute,"" court documents show. Dr. Brooke Lundbohm told the Waukesha County, Wisconsin, court that Morgan believes she has mind-control capabilities and can talk to Harry Potter villain Lord Voldemort, according to CNN affiliate WITI. She believes in unicorns, Lundbohm told the court. Morgan also laughed inappropriately and squatted in her chair during her competency review, the doctor said, according to WITI. Another expert, Dr. Kenneth Robbins, said Morgan wasn't concerned about a potential long prison sentence, and she said she uses Vulcan mind control, of ""Star Trek"" fame, to feel or believe whatever she wants, WITI reported. Morgan also thinks she can speak to Slenderman and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Robbins said, adding that she ""looked happy, almost giddy"" during her exam. While both doctors opined that Morgan was not faking, Lundbohm told the court she could be deemed competent in the future and recommended medication. ""She needs to grow up,"" the doctor said, according to WITI. The judge in the case set a November 12 hearing to discuss the competency report and found ""that the defendant is incompetent to proceed at this time but likely to become competent,"" court documents say. A doctor last month ruled Morgan incompetent, meaning she's incapable of assisting her attorney in her defense. Morgan and Anissa Weier were arrested in May and charged with luring a pal into a wooded area in Waukesha after a sleepover before stabbing her 19 times, authorities said. The suspects allegedly left the victim to crawl to her own rescue, and a bicyclist found the victim, also 12, on a sidewalk later in the day. The girls were trying to please Slenderman, a horror story meme the girls had encountered on a website known as Creepypasta Wiki, according to a criminal complaint. One of the suspects told police that Slenderman is the site's supposed leader, and to climb into his realm, a user must kill someone, the complaint says. Morgan and Anissa are charged as adults with attempted first-degree intentional homicide, and both girls' attorneys are hoping to have their cases returned to the juvenile court system. CNN's Amanda Watts, Jason Hanna and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Asked whether she was competent, Morgan Geyser didn't speak, court documents show .

"(CNN) -- If you think you saw a flying saucer Saturday over Hawaii, you might not be crazy -- except what you saw didn't come from outer space, though that may be its ultimate destination. After several weather-related delays this month, NASA's new spacecraft lifted off from the U.S. Navy's Pacific Missile Range facility in Kauai, Hawaii, on Saturday morning. The space agency said its Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator, or LDSD, went up at 8:45 a.m. (2:45 p.m. ET), carried aloft by a giant balloon on a mission to test landing technologies for a future human mission to Mars. Shortly after 11 a.m., the test vehicle dropped from the balloon and the ""powered flight,"" as NASA described it, began. At this point, the disc-like LDSD was about 120,000 feet, or more than 20 miles, above Earth. NASA said their current information indicates the spacecraft's rocket fired just as they hoped, with the expectation that it would rise up to about 180,000 feet, reaching the stratosphere. Eventually, a donut-shaped tube inflated -- which makes the whole thing look like a flying saucer -- thus beginning the deceleration process. The next thing that was supposed to slow the vehicle's descent was a giant parachute, though NASA acknowledged it ""did not deploy as expected."" The whole process ended with the vehicle's splashdown in the Pacific about 11:35 a.m., or 30 minutes after it was released from the balloon. ""From what we know, the test was successful,"" said Shannon Ridinger, a NASA spokeswoman. Ridinger noted that noted NASA officials are still going through the data to assess everything what happened, noting that the only flaw known right now was that the parachute the space agency was testing had ""an issue."" Project managers are expected to give a more thorough rundown of how things went on Sunday morning. Current technology for decelerating from high speeds during re-entry into the atmosphere to the final stages of landing on Mars dates back to NASA's Viking Program, which put two landers on the Martian surface in 1976. The basic Viking parachute design has been used ever since. It was successfully used again in 2012 to deliver the rover Curiosity to Mars. Curiosity, by the way, just celebrated the anniversary of its first Martian year on the Red Planet. NASA will need new and improved landing technologies to handle the larger spaceships of tomorrow and land them on rocky surfaces. NASA's deep-space craft readying for launch . Happy anniversary!

"(CNN) -- No one can accuse China of stinting in its efforts to reach for the sky. Less than a year after construction was halted on a world-beating 838-meter tower in Changsa in central China (just days after it began) architects have revealed plans to build something even bigger. At one kilometer (0.6 miles) high, the largest of the two Phoenix Towers planned for Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China, will be the tallest in the world if completed on schedule in 2017/2018. The towers will also be crazily futuristic and super environmentally friendly. And pink . ""Yes, [they are pink],"" Laurie Chetwood of UK-based design firm Chetwoods Architects tells CNN. ""They reflect the spectacular colors of the sunsets in the region."" Designed to sit on an island in a lake, the largest of the towers will stand 172 meters (564 feet) taller than Burj Khalifa in Dubai. The project is still awaiting government final approval, but if all goes to plan it could steal a march on the Kingdom Tower in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which is also designed to top out at one kilometer, but not until 2019. With a 2012 population of 9.7 million, Wuhan is located on the Yangtze River. It's a major transportation hub that's been called ""the Chicago of China."" Biggest kaleidoscope and floating restaurants . ""[We were asked] to create an iconic building for Wuhan, which embodied a strong environmental and social content as well as reflecting Chinese tradition,"" says Chetwood. The design is inspired by dualism in Chinese culture -- the traditional Chinese phoenix symbol of the two birds, ""Feng"" and ""Huang,"" as well as the idea of yin and yang. Feng Huang, or phoenix, are a pair of mythical birds in Chinese culture traditionally used to denote royalty. Three large spheres containing celestial-themed restaurants accessible via ""skywalks"" will be suspended between the two towers. The spheres ""represent planets orbiting the Towers,"" according to the designers. If giant pink towers and celestial spheres aren't gaudy enough, the larger building will have the unlikely boast of housing the world's tallest kaleidoscope driven by a wind turbine. It'll project a psychedelic display for people gazing up from below. A ground-level commercial center looks set to continue China's current obsession with imitating global architectural styles. ""You'll have a French street, a Japanese street, a Turkish street and so forth ... to allow people to see the world without necessarily having to leave China,"" Chetwood told the Guardian. Sci-fi environmental features . The towers are designed to have green features such as pollution-absorbing surfaces to filter the city's air as well as technology to aerate and filter the water. Thermal chimneys, suspended air gardens and biomass boilers for waste recycling are also part of the plan. The towers are designed to be able to generate enough power to fulfill their own needs and those of neighboring areas. ""The Feng tower uses cutting-edge technology to 'feed' the Huang tower with renewable power in a symbiotic process,"" the design firm said in a statement. The two towers will cover seven hectares of a 47-hectare site on the island. ""It is wonderful to work in China -- the response to new ideas is always enthusiastic and optimistic,"" says Chetwood. ""The chance to develop a unique site -- a large lake in a large city -- provides a wonderful opportunity to create something very special for China.""","China to build the world's tallest towers, called the Phoenix Towers, in Wuhan in central China .

"(CNN) -- Every spring Halloween meets haute couture at the Carnival of Venice. Culminating March 4 after nearly a month of masked frivolity, Italy's most popular festival draws up to three million visitors annually. Wearing feathered headdresses, flowing capes and, most importantly, a bevy of bejeweled masks, they enjoy a giant masquerade party that spills onto the streets and into the canals. The Piazza San Marco is the epicenter of the action, especially during preliminary rounds of the Maschera più bella contest for the best masked costume. Every day dozens of masked contestants stomp down the runway of the Gran Teatro, a temporary outdoor theater, hoping to make the grand final. Costumes skew toward the elaborate, with men and women dressed as brightly-colored court jesters, kabuki princesses, and glittering animals. Regardless of the outfit, Venetian masks—a symbol of the city and a focal point of the carnival—are essential to any winning ensemble. During the final, contestants pout and vogue in front of an international panel of costume, fashion and mask designers. Among them is Stefano Nicolao, one of Venice's most esteemed costume designers, who has dressed Hollywood stars for films including ""Elizabeth"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" He does not approach his responsibilities as a juror lightly. ""The theme of the mask is absolutely essential to help your imagination arrive at what I call the dream,"" he says. ""For me, emotion must emanate through the costume and the person who wears it. There must be beauty, originality, an explosion of color."" Given the complexity of Nicolao's criteria, there is no formula for success. Last year the Italian artist Anna Marconi won the contest on her 17th try. Dressed as a sumptuous doll, she offered a high-fashion take on the toy box. The 2012 winners—a group of five men and women from Germany—wore billowing pink and purple dresses with matching masks. They appeared to be masquerading as Marie Antoinette's tea servants. Read more: The world's most colorful carnival celebrations . A history of craftsmanship . The origins of the masked carnival remain a mystery, though it's often said the festival first appeared in the 12th century to celebrate a military victory. Today the city uses the carnival to showcase Venetian culture, which includes a long and proud history of mask masking. Artisans have passed down mask making skills over successive generations. As a child Maximiliano Gimenez learned the craft from his uncle. Today he runs Blue Moon Venice, an atelier and retailer. He and his 15 artisans produce roughly 15,000 Venetian masks per year and are currently training two young apprentices. Some of his staff have been making masks for more than twenty years. The ""Volto Piume"" (Feather face), one of his most ornate masks, retails from €200. Starting with a paper mache base, artisans apply a thin layer of paint that cracks to give the mask an antique look. They then adorn it with lace sourced in Venice, and finish it with gold leaf and Swarovski crystals. ""At the end it is encircled with two layers of real cock feathers in different colors,"" Gimenez says. ""We only use natural colors, of course."" Read more: This is the eerie, beautiful world of aquascaping . Unmasking the mind . The enduring popularity of masks doesn't stem merely from their beauty. It also stems from the freedom that comes with hiding who you are—or at least who people think you should be. Carla Almanza-de Quant, an artist and Venetian mask maker in California, has clients all over the world. They call on her to create gorgeous masks that will turn heads and break the ice. ""Once you put on a mask you're cheerful, you're playful, you're a more wonderful you,"" she says. ""You become a fantasy character and you interact with others in a more outgoing way. The real mask is the one we put on every day because society tells you how to do this, and how to do that."" Read more: Life of a muse: What is it like to inspire art as a living? Chinese rivals? The global interest in masks isn't waning, and mass retailers are keen to tap into the market. Target invites customers to ""make a dramatic entrance to your next masquerade ball"" with its $18.49 Venetian Mask with Headpiece in polyester. Walmart sells a $9.99 Venetian Raven Adult Halloween Mask in plastic with ""a unique crackle finish."" The arrival of cheap, mass-produced masks from China has created new frustrations for Venice's mask makers. Chinese manufacturers sometimes try to sell their products under the brand ""Made in Italy"", and attach labels that wrongly say they were made by hand in Venice. The influx of low-quality masks, which retail for a few dollars, also distorts the expectations of consumers who begin to question why authentic Venetian masks can cost several hundred euros. Gimenez of Blue Moon Venice believes his masks carry the soul of the city with them. ""Those who want to buy mass-produced plastic should not come to us,"" he says. ""Our customers receive something original and unique, created by artisans with passion and love.""","The Carnival of Venice attracts around three million visitors every year .

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts child rape suspect fled after cutting off his GPS monitoring bracelet, then -- days later -- returned home, beat and tied up his stepfather before stealing his gun and about 200 rounds of ammunition, police say. Gregory Lewis remained at large Saturday, according to Southbridge police, who warn that he ""is still considered armed and dangerous."" The 26-year-old was arrested on August 5, then arraigned the next day on four felony child rape charges, according to police. He was let go on bail and required to wear a monitoring bracelet. But more than a month later, on September 15, police learned Lewis severed that bracelet and drove off in his parents' 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee, according to Detective Sgt. Carlos Dingui. Authorities announced on Facebook on September 20 -- the same day he was spotted hundreds of miles away in Kentucky -- that the Southbridge resident had fled and was wanted ""for several outstanding felony arrest warrants."" The next reported sighting of Lewis in his hometown -- a community of about 17,000 people located 20 miles southwest of Worcester -- was Thursday, the day of the assault on his stepfather, according to Dingui. ""This gentleman was literally shackled and held in the home, with a metal shackle,"" Southbridge police Chief Daniel Charette told CNN affiliate WCVB. Dingui said Lewis handcuffed him to prevent police from being called. Later that night, surveillance images released by police showed Lewis in a convenience store about 30 miles southwest in Vernon, Connecticut. It's not known where he went next, including whether he was still in New England. The suspect left Southbridge with his stepfather's Beretta 9mm semiautomatic handgun, according to Dingui. He also took approximately 200 rounds of ammunition. Montana teacher initially given 31 days in rape of student now gets 10 years .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Music legend and convicted killer Phil Spector's latest prison mugshots show both a happy and a sad face. The California Department of Corrections released two previously unseen photos of Spector, who has been in prison for more than five years with another 14 to go. Spector, who is being held at California Health Care Facility in Stockton, is eligible for parole consideration when he turns 88. Spector, 74, was convicted of second-degree murder in the 2003 shooting death of actress Lana Clarkson. He's wearing a broad smile in a mugshot taken July 24, 2013, while another taken on October 28, 2013 captures an apparently sullen Spector. Both photos suggest each date was a bad hair day for the inmate. He has not been allowed access to his infamous collection of curly wigs since he was handcuffed and locked up after his May 2009 conviction. Corrections officials said at the time that wigs are banned because they could be used to hide contraband. Spector's ""wall of sound"" approach to record production -- the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label -- changed the music world in the 1960s.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama's former defense secretary, Leon Panetta, says if the White House had listened to his advice on U.S. troop levels in Iraq, the country's security situation may not have unraveled. ""To this day, I believe that a small U.S. troop presence in Iraq could have effectively advised the Iraqi military on how to deal with al-Qaeda's resurgence and the sectarian violence that has engulfed the country,"" Panetta writes in his upcoming autobiography, due out next week. President Obama announced in October 2011 that virtually all of the 39,000 U.S. troops would leave Iraq by the end of that year. Obama had said that it was a fulfillment to his 2008 campaign promise to bring troops in Iraq home. But at the same time, talks to get the Status of Forces Agreement, which provided immunity from prosecution to those troops, were at a standstill due to the internal politics of Iraq. Panetta, who said he argued behind the scenes and publicly for a small amount of troops to be left for additional training for Iraq's military, was frustrated with White House negotiations on the deal. Under Secretary of Defense Michele Flournoy led the administration's efforts in the heated debate. ""Those on our side viewed the White House as so eager to rid itself of Iraq that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests,"" he said in excerpts of the book released by Time Magazine. He writes that his views were shared by other military commanders in the region and the Joint Chiefs of Staff but he believes that the Commander-in-Chief could have done more. ""Officials there seemed content to endorse an agreement if State and Defense could reach one, but without the President's active advocacy, al-Maliki was allowed to slip away. The deal never materialized,"" writes Panetta. President Obama told CBS's ""60 Minutes"" that former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had ""squandered"" the opportunity to be a thriving democracy with a strong military because he ""was much more interested in consolidating his Shia base and very suspicious of the Sunnis and the Kurds"" than creating a united government. The president said that sending U.S. troops back into Iraq is not the solution. ""We cannot do this for them, because it's not just a military problem It's a political problem,"" he said on Sunday. ""And if we make the mistake of simply sending U.S. troops back in, we can maintain peace for a while. But unless there is a change in how, not just Iraq, but countries like Syria and some of the other countries in the region, think about what political accommodation means. Think about what tolerance means."" But Panetta worries that in the meantime the deterioration of Iraq's security has potentially wiped out gains in the fight against terrorism. ""The news from Iraq bothered me to no end. In my view, the ISIS offensive in 2014 greatly increases the risk that Iraq will become al-Qaeda's next safe haven. That is exactly what it had in Afghanistan pre-9/11,"" he writes. ""After all we have done to decimate al-Qaeda's senior leadership and its core, those efforts will be for naught if we allow it to rebuild a base of operations in the Middle East."" Panetta served as Secretary of Defense from 2011 until 2013. He returned to his role as director at the Panetta Institute for Public Policy, which he founded with his wife in 1997.

"(CNN) -- Police in Oklahoma said Saturday they've interviewed the man who allegedly beheaded a 54-year-old woman at his former workplace. Alton Alexander Nolen, 30, was shot inside the Vaughn Food processing plant but regained consciousness in the hospital, said Jeremy Lewis, spokesman for the Moore police department. Nolen was interviewed Friday in the hospital; police haven't revealed what was said. Police expect him to be released and moved to a jail by early next week, Lewis said. Nolen's Facebook page provides no indication he planned to attack anybody. He had recently converted to Islam and started the page under the name Jah'Keem Yisrael. The cover photo appears to be of fighters holding weapons. The postings include numerous all-caps messages about Islam and quotations from the Quran, but make no reference to job dissatisfaction. Most postings end with ""****InfoFromAMuslim****"" Some postings are political, such as one that runs with an image of the Joker, from Batman comics: ""AMERICA SO CALL HELPS IRAQ (WHICH NOT)- WELL WHY CANT U HELP THE GAZA CITIZENS AGAINST ISRAEL LOL..I UPLOAD THIS PIK BECAUSE AMERICA AND ISRAEL ARE WICKED. WAKE UP MUSLIMS!!!"" CNN has confirmed with Moore police that the Facebook page and the images belong to Nolen. Workplace violence: Know the warning signs . No terrorism link found . Nolen had tried to convert co-workers to Islam, officials said. U.S. law enforcement officials said there are no indications linking Thursday's attack to terrorism. ISIS, also known as the Islamic State, has made a name for its itself with several videotaped beheadings in the Middle East. The Oklahoma Conference of Churches issued a statement on Saturday urging ""all Oklahomans and people everywhere not to equate Mr. (Nolen's) actions with the beliefs and practices of the Islamic Community in Oklahoma."" The statement said that ""The Islamic Community of Oklahoma has consistently condemned all violence -- most especially acts of violence ostensibly carried out in the name of Islam. Along with our Muslim brothers and sisters we affirm that true Islam is, in fact, a religion of peace and that those inflicting violence in the name of Islam are perverting Islam for their own ends."" Suspect had lost his job . The attack happened very soon after Nolen learned he'd lost his job at the processing plant. Police said he walked into the front office of the plant and attacked one of first people he encountered, Colleen Hufford, 54. He severed her head with a knife and then attacked 43-year-old Traci Johnson, who was in stable condition at a nearby hospital for treatment of ""numerous wounds,"" according to police. ""He wasn't targeting anyone, wasn't going specifically after them,"" the police spokesman said. ""It appears they were just in his way as he came in."" Nolen stopped attacking people when he was shot by Mark Vaughan, who besides being his company's CEO has been a reserve deputy with the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office, said Sheriff John Whetsel. Nolen had been incarcerated until March 2013, for possession of a controlled substance, escaping confinement and resisting an officer. CNN affiliate KOKI reported Nolen was arrested in 2006 when an officer saw him throw a bag of crack cocaine and a bag of marijuana out the vehicle window as the officer pulled him over for traffic violations. Nolen was put on probation, KOKI reported. In 2010, a state trooper stopped Nolen for an expired tag and discovered Nolen had outstanding warrants, KOKI reported. The trooper, Betsy Randolph, told CNN on Saturday that Nolen started struggling after she put a handcuff on one wrist. Nolen ran and was arrested after a 12-hour manhunt. ""He kept looking over his shoulder because he knew I wanted to shoot him, but obviously I couldn't shoot him in the back,"" Randolph told CNN. ""If there had been any way to know the things he is alleged to have done a few days ago I would have killed him when I had a chance."" A spokesman for Gov. Mary Fallin, Alex Weintz, noted the governor had blocked Nolen from receiving parole in 2012. Weintz said Saturday: ""The suspect came up for parole in 2012 and the governor denied his parole. She reviewed his file and didn't think that he was a good candidate for early parole."" CNN's Evan Perez, Pamela Brown, Shelby Lin Erdman, Mark Bixler, Greg Botelho and John Branch contributed to this story.","NEW: State trooper says Nolen struggled with her during 2010 traffic stop .

"(CNN) -- The American held in North Korea, Matthew Miller, begins his six-year sentence of hard labor on Thursday. A North Korean government official released a photo of Miller, taken on Wednesday. Dressed in a blue-gray prison garment with the number 107 and his head shaved, Miller is seen with his eyes downcast, staring away from the camera. Details about where he'll serve his sentence or what labor he will be required to do were not released. Miller was convicted of committing ""acts hostile"" to North Korea and sentenced earlier this month. North Korea has accused him of ripping up his visa on arrival to the country so he could go to prison and expose human rights violations there, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. KCNA described him as ""rudely behaved,"" saying he was sent to infiltrate prison as part of a United States campaign against North Korea. ""He perpetrated the above-said acts in the hope of becoming a world famous guy and the second Snowden through intentional hooliganism,"" state media said. Before being sent to prison, Miller asked his family for help in a phone call on Wednesday, according to a source. He has also written a letter imploring U.S. officials for help. The letters have been sent to Miller's family in which he addressed Speaker of the House John Boehner, Sen. Mitch McConnell, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Sen. Barbara Boxer, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and first lady Michelle Obama. Miller's family lives in Bakersfield, California, and has not spoken to the press. Miller told CNN's Will Ripley in a brief interview earlier this month in Pyongyang that he ""prepared to violate the law of DPRK before coming here. And I deliberately committed my crime."" But he didn't elaborate on what his ""crime"" was. It's unclear whether his statements were made freely or under coercion. Miller is a 2008 graduate of Bakersfield High School, according to CNN affiliate KBAK.

"(CNN) -- Mourners flooded social media with messages of grief following the death of Brittany Maynard, who took her own life Saturday in the face of a debilitating brain cancer. ""Happy to see that Brittany Maynard ended her journey in the dignified way she'd hoped to. RIP,"" tweeted Austin Wintory, typical of the majority of the sentiments. ""I truly believe Brittany had a major purpose in this life,"" Cathy Reidy of New York wrote in the guest book on Maynard's obituary on Legacy.com. ""She shed light on an issue that leaves America thinking."" Criticism after Maynard's death was muted, but people who oppose assisted suicide had made their feelings known earlier. Maggie Karner, a woman with the same brain cancer, posted an October 29 open letter to Maynard on YouTube. ""All of us are feeling your loss, your pain,"" Karner said. ""Nobody is judging, but people are watching."" Karner compared Maynard to someone standing on a ledge, threatening to jump. Normally, people on the ground urge the person not to jump and remind them of reasons to live, she said. ""What would happen if our society decided to yell to that ledge jumper, 'Yeah, you're right, there isn't a better way. Go ahead,'"" Karner asked. In an article published October 10 on the Federalist website, Karner wrote that Maynard may have wanted to control when she died but ""As for my cancer journey, circumstances out of my control are not the worst thing that can happen to me. The worst thing would be losing faith, refusing to trust in God's purpose in my life and trying to grab that control myself."" Karner is scheduled to appear Monday night on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" Maynard wrote CNN opinion piece . Maynard addressed the issue of choice last month in an opinion piece written for CNN. ""I would not tell anyone else that he or she should choose death with dignity,"" she said. ""My question is: Who has the right to tell me that I don't deserve this choice? That I deserve to suffer for weeks or months in tremendous amounts of physical and emotional pain? Why should anyone have the right to make that choice for me?"" Maynard died Saturday in Oregon, according to an obituary posted on her website. The pretty, just-married 29-year-old had turned herself into the newest face identified with the assisted suicide movement by talking openly about her plans to die. She left with an upbeat message at the end of the obit. ""It is people who pause to appreciate life and give thanks who are happiest,"" she wrote in her final message. ""If we change our thoughts, we change our world! Love and peace to you all."" Opponents cite religious reasons . People who voiced opposition to assisted suicide often gave religious reasons. For instance, Pamela Couvrette, who has a painful disease, posted an open letter to Maynard on October 12 on her blog, Guarding the Deposit. ""When I die it will be on His timetable and by His method despite my weak moments when I am hoping that day will come sooner rather than later,"" wrote Couvrette, who identifies herself as a former atheist. Couvrette wrote that she has hyperacusis, which ""makes normal everyday noises very painful."" ""Suicide has been an answer to some in my situation,"" Couvrette wrote. ""I want to tell you why it's not an answer for me."" In a discussion thread on Reddit, a poster going by Forestpixie blasted ""religious families that insist on us keeping their dead body family member alive."" ""I think this really speaks to their ignorance of science and medicine,"" Forestpixie wrote. ""They refuse to accept what's really going on, and want to believe their loved one is still in there (they're not), and that perhaps by some miracle they will return to perfect health."" 'Her comments bothered me' Another Reddit poster questioned the use of the word ""brave"" to describe Maynard. ""I saw someone say something like: 'if she is brave for killing herself, then what are the thousands of cancer patients that fight to the death?' I kind of understand the sentiment, but at the end of the day, when you think about it, why can't both decisions be brave? And who ... are we to decide what is brave and what isn't?"" One Reddit poster questioned Maynard's decision to go public. Wrote SitYoureLegosTheir: ""Her comments bothered me as they seemed to try and justify HER need but dismiss that of other sufferers she deemed to not have a valid reason to end their life."" In the Twitterverse, two posters were less ambivalent: ""Any way you look at it, suicide is wrong because it does not end suffering, it ends hope,"" tweeted ZEFFeREEN .

"(CNN) -- The tragic death of much loved actor and comedian Robin Williams took the world by surprise. There has been a steady stream of news reports -- at first conveying shock and disbelief then, disappointingly, moving on to salacious speculation about the cause and method of his death. Media coverage of mental health and suicide has come a long way over the last few years however, on this occasion; many newspapers got it badly wrong. In Britain, some journalists went too far and breached the Editors' Code, the ethical standard on press reporting that states that ""when reporting suicide, care should be taken to avoid excessive detail about the method used."" Many of the tabloids and online reports gave unnecessary detail. Part of the reason is that the U.S. police spokesperson put into the public domain far more detail than would be the norm in the UK, Australia or New Zealand. When explicit descriptions which illustrate the method used are put in the public domain we know that this can have devastating consequences and lead to acts of imitation. There have been many research studies presenting evidence for this and the tragic events in Bridgend should have been a valuable lesson for the media in the need for safe reporting. When a media report describes clear details of unusual methods of suicide and essentially gives a ""how to"" guide -- the danger is it can make suicide seem like a more accessible action to take. Opinion: Why Williams lost to depression . The media also oversimplified the reasons Williams took his own life -- for example highlighting money problems -- when we know that there is no one reason people choose to take their lives. The reasons are varied and complex. Concerning too is the effect that wall-to-wall media coverage about a celebrity suicide can have on the public. However unintentionally, it can appear to glamorize and romanticize the incident. One of the most well documented examples of the copycat effect of a celebrity suicide was that of Marilyn Monroe. During the month of her suicide in August 1962 there were an additional 303 suicides, an increase of 12%. Suicide is a sensitive and complicated subject which affects a huge number of people. This is why, when news of Robin Williams' death first broke, we issued a briefing to all newsdesks which provided advice on how to report suicide in a sensitive, and responsible, way. We followed it up with a second briefing the next afternoon. We urged journalists to consult Samaritans media guidelines, this resource has been produced in conjunction with journalists and has been welcomed by editors. While we appreciate journalists have a hugely difficult task presenting breaking news to readers quickly and concisely against increasingly tight deadlines, accuracy and sensitivity cannot take a back seat. When journalists are writing pieces they should always consider the impact that the tone, content, prominence and imagery of their story will have on their audience. Opinion: Suicide doesn't set you free . I have been asked a lot over the last few days why certain aspects of a death by suicide should not be reported. In short it's to keep people, who may be struggling with their mental health, safe. We know that around 6,000 people take their own life every year in the UK, and thousands more will attempt suicide, seriously contemplate it and battle mental health problems. When done correctly, media coverage can be incredibly powerful in helping people to seek support and advice. It can also contribute towards changing public attitudes towards mental health problems and reducing the stigma that sadly still exists. We are hopeful that there is willingness in the media industry to listen and act on the concerns raised by the mental health charities, experts and their own audiences. Social media is giving readers a voice like never before and editors now know quickly when they are out of step with the public mood. We believe we can work collaboratively with the media to make mental health and suicide reporting safe. The views expressed in this commentary are solely the author's.","There have been many news reports on actor Robin Williams since his death this week .

"Newark, New Jersey (CNN) -- It's something you don't see every day: A Republican governor speaking at an inner city church, trying to end the stigma associated with drug addiction. ""We have to acknowledge the disease and treat their illness,"" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told a crowd gathered here for a forum he organized. ""We would never stigmatize someone who has cancer. Yet, we feel free to stigmatize someone who may have tried - made one bad decision - and because of their makeup, they become an addict."" For Christie, working with former drug addicts could be helpful if he decides to run for president in 2016. The image could humanize a governor who is better known for his tough talking, finger wagging style -- especially after his administration was engulfed by the scandal surrounding the closing of the George Washington Bridge. But Christie said he isn't doing anything different. ""It's always been there,"" Christie said of his compassionate side. ""The fact is that's the stuff that gets the most publicity because it's the most entertaining on TV, and I get that."" ""You need to be compassionate and you need to listen, and I have the ability to do that too,"" Christie insists. Just don't call him a compassionate conservative, a term first coined by George W. Bush during his first presidential bid. ""Listen, the term has already been used by a previous president,"" Christie tells us. ""I think this is just me being myself. I care about people no matter what stage of life they're at, no matter what circumstance they're confronted with,"" he says, quickly adding that ""when it's required to get in someone's face and tell them off, I'll do that too."" Luckily, he laughingly assured this reporter that wasn't ""required"" -- at that moment. Christie held his forum on drug addiction at the church where Whitney Houston grew up and learned to perform. In 2012, the church hosted her funeral after Houston lost her battle with drugs. ""The reason we're here is because of Whitney Houston in a respect because I came here for the funeral, invited here by her mom. That's where I met Pastor Joe Carter, who was my partner today and the pastor of this church for the past 22 years, and we've been talking about this issue a lot since then,"" says Christie. When Houston died, Christie lowered the state's flags, and got blow back for honoring an addict - precisely the kind of stigma he's trying to change. Addiction is a very personal issue for Christie. His close friend from law school died of an overdose earlier this year. ""I can't tell you how many times all of us - friends of his, dear friends - intervened and got him to treatment, dealt with his wife and his children and tried to help him. Now, we couldn't,"" Christie told the audience. The governor wants to change the way the legal system treats nonviolent drug offenders, providing them treatment instead of jail sentences. Still, he draws a bright line between destigmaizing drug addiction and decriminalizing drug use. ""I think they're two big differences right?"" Christie said. ""I don't think we should be telling our children this is ok. And by decriminalizing it, I think we're telling them it's ok. It's not OK. You should never make this choice in the first place, but If you do, and you become addicted and are subject to that disease, then we need to treat you and destigmatize that treatment."" But he added: ""I don't think decriminalization and destigmatization have to go together. In fact, I would argue that decriminalization would lead to more addicts and that's not something we want."" Christie's comments mark a shift in tone among Republicans when it comes to drugs. Richard Nixon first launched the so-called war on drugs and Nancy Reagan kept the effort alive through the 1980s with her ""just say no"" campaign. But Christie says the war on drugs has failed. ""The war on drugs was well-intentioned,"" he said. ""It just has not worked. We know much more today than we knew 30 years ago, that this is a disease -- about it being physiological, and in some places genetic -- and so we need to treat that disease."" He added: ""I think Mrs. Reagan and those who fought the war on drugs that way absolutely were trying to be the most effective they could be and were operating with the best information they had at the time. But it's been thirty plus years now, and we have more information and we should evolve over time to be more effective."" Christie's views on drug abusers - treating not jailing them - sets him apart from other high profile Republicans, especially those considering a run for the White House. Most potential 2016 GOP contenders are maintaining a hardline on drugs, if they talk about the issue at all. Still, another potential 2016 candidate -- Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, R- KY -- comes closest to Christie with his push to curb the mandatory minimum drug sentencing that was once a staple of Republican tough on crime policy. Christie frames his views as consistent with self-described pro life conservatives, who value life above all else. But they could backfire with conservatives -- voters he needs to win the GOP presidential nomination -- who don't see the connection. ""Listen, I'll take whatever risk I need to take if I'm telling the truth as I see it, and the fact is it was well-intentioned,"" Christie said. ""I'm not worried about turning anybody off. I want to tell people the truth,"" he said. But if Christie is so willing to use the personal experience of a friend overdosing to try to destigmatize drug abuse, what about his very different, very personal battle: his weight. After all, obesity is an epidemic in America. ""Sure, I think at some point when appropriate, I would because I know that struggle personally and I know how difficult that is,"" Christie said when asked whether he might the issue as part of his public platform. Christie's waist size has shrunk since he underwent lap-band surgery in 2013. But he was reluctant to tell people how they should lose weight. ""I want to be careful because I don't want to proselytize because I know how difficult it is to deal with this problem and I know it's been more difficult at times when people who feel that [they] are struggling with it, that they're being lectured,"" Christie said. ""I've gone through that."" Does he think obesity is an addiction? ""I don't know the answer to that question but what I will tell you is that I know it's a struggle and I've had that struggle and continue to have that struggle,"" Christie responded. ""But I'm doing well now and I want to continue doing well."" Christie held the drug forum as 2016 speculation intensifies. He sidestepped questions about whether Mitt Romney - a good friend of his - should make a third White House run. ""I have great respect and affection and admiration for Mitt and for Ann,"" he said. ""They're both real friends, not political friends. And that's up to him. He gets to make that decision. If he wants to do it again, more power to him. If he doesn't, that's ok too."" Christie insists his own decision about whether to throw his hat in the presidential ring is ""absolutely"" independent of anyone else - from Romney to Jeb Bush. So when will he decide? ""I'll make a decision after the first of the year,"" he said. He really hasn't decided, we ask incredulously? ""I really haven't decided,"" Christie says with a mischievous smile. ""I'm not kidding around."" CNN's Adam Levy contributed to this report .","Chris Christie to CNN: Must end stigma associated with drug abuse .

"(CNN) -- The virtual cathedral for one of America's most revered cars will reluctantly fill a monster sinkhole that brought it both pain and gain. The National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky, also said Saturday it and Chevrolet will restore three of the eight vehicles that the 45-foot-wide hole swallowed in February, but will leave the remains of the five others -- too wrecked to fix -- on display. ""We really wanted to preserve a portion of the hole so that guests for years to come could see a little bit of what it was like, but after receiving more detailed pricing, the costs outweighs the benefit,"" museum Executive Director Wendell Strode said. Why was the hole's filling ever in doubt? Visitor traffic since February jumped 70% compared to the same period last year, as people lined up to see not only the brand's past but also the newly mangled vehicles and gaping earth, museum spokeswoman Katie Frassinelli said. But the board learned that preserving part of the hole would cost $1 million more than it would to fill the whole thing. And the effort required to keep it safe -- eyesores like 35-foot retaining walls and steel beams -- made preservation even less appealing, Frassinelli said. ""That's no longer a naturally occurring, interesting sinkhole,"" she said. Frassinelli said the museum isn't revealing how much the renovation will cost. The project will start sometime after early November. The privately funded, not-for-profit attraction has gone from shock to proudly displaying its own spectacular damage in months. The ground opened at the museum's Skydome section in the early morning of February 12. Surveillance video showed the hole devouring some of the eight cars that it took down. The hole was measured at about 45 feet wide, 60 feet long and up to 30 feet deep. Western Kentucky is cave country, and it turned out a previously undetected cave was under the Skydome, Frassinelli said. Sinkholes pop up regularly in the area, sometimes caused by ground water eroding underground limestone over many years. After experts examined the cave and determined the rest of the facility was safe, the museum reopened -- and started letting visitors view the sinkhole behind plexiglass five days after the incident. By late April, visitors could walk into the Skydome and stand just feet from the hole's edge. The museum also brought up the fallen cars -- some sliced or mashed -- and put them on display as mangled as they were found. But on Saturday the museum announced three cars would be restored, including a 2009 ZR1 prototype known as the Blue Devil, among GM's fastest production cars. Also getting restored: the 1-millionth Corvette produced (a white 1992 convertible), and a 1962 tuxedo black Corvette, which was the oldest to fall. The others were too damaged. But their remains will continued to be displayed -- eventually back in the Skydome, where an exhibit will be dedicated to the sinkhole, the museum said. General Motors will provide nearly $250,000 to help recovery efforts, the museum said. The damage got the attention of gearheads worldwide. Reports estimated the total value of the cars at more than $1 million. Experts call the Corvette the most collected car in America, and General Motors calls it the ""world's longest-running, continuously produced passenger car."" Since the 'Vette's 1953 debut, more than 1.5 million have rolled off Chevrolet assembly lines. The sleek silhouette has transformed into a pop culture icon across TV, films and advertising.

"(CNN) -- Greg Allen's obsession with finding his missing daughter began more than a decade ago, when the mother finally made good on a threat and fled with the daughter from Texas to Mexico, according to him and authorities. Sabrina Allen was a month away from turning age 5, and the visit with her non-custodial mother, Dara Marie Llorens, was supposed to last only a weekend in April 2002, as part of a court agreement. But that weekend visitation in Austin lasted 12 years and finally ended Tuesday, when Mexican and U.S. authorities said they found the girl and her mother living in seclusion in a small apartment in a town between Mexico City and Puebla. The mother will face charges in Travis County, Texas, said Dan Powers, an FBI assistant special agent in charge in San Antonio, Texas. So much time has passed that Allen's daughter is all but grown, now 17 years old. Moreover, his daughter has been told over the years that her father was ""a bad guy"" and ""a wife beater"" -- all false accusations, Allen declared. But Allen never gave up hope. He began a website dedicated to his daughter: FindSabrina.org, which offered a $20,000 reward. He hired a private investigator. And he pressed his public campaign so relentlessly that people wondered whether he was going too far. ""I was Ahab and the white whale. I was not going to survive,"" Allen said of his pursuit. ""I've had people say, ""Of course, she's with her mother; what's the big deal?' ""People just don't understand,"" he said. ""I was accused of overstepping my bounds."" A confidential informant . On Wednesday, Allen was euphoric over his daughter's recovery. He learned the news while at the dentist Tuesday and had to rinse his mouth. The police action resulted in a minor injury to a federal Mexican police officer who was involved in the arrest of Llorens, 44, according to Philip Klein, a private investigator retained by Allen. Llorens was located in Mexico through information from a confidential informant, Klein said. But Sabrina Allen has been through so much emotional trauma that she isn't allowed to immediately see her father. She's in solid physical health but hasn't been in school for a while, her father said. She is now under the care of a clinical psychologist in Texas. ""I haven't gotten to see her yet,"" Greg Allen said Wednesday. ""She's in pretty bad shape, from my understanding,"" he said, becoming tearful. ""She's just not ready to see me and my family. I hope and pray that's coming soon, and I can't predict it."" He described the 12-year hunt for his daughter as a tormenting odyssey. ""It's a long road. You don't know what the outcome is,"" Allen said. ""I told myself the hardest thing to learn was that I could have a life while looking for her."" When Sabrina Allen is eventually allowed to reunite with her father, she will discover that she has a new family who has heard so much about her but has never met her: Greg Allen's new wife and their children. ""We hope to have her home as soon as possible,"" Allen said. How his daughter was taken from him began on April 19, 2002, according to the website dedicated to his once-missing daughter. A weekend outing . On that day, Llorens allegedly violated a court-ordered child custody agreement and disappeared with her daughter during a scheduled weekend visit, the FBI said in its wanted bulletin for Llorens. Llorens was supposed to return the daughter to her father two days later. He was the primary guardian, the FBI said. The father's website doesn't specify why the relationship between him and Llorens didn't work out, but the site alleges that Llorens has a mental illness. ""Dara's court ordered psychological evaluation indicated that she has a well-established personality disorder, and that she is likely to act in her own interest, instead of Sabrina's,"" the website charges. Llorens and her attorney couldn't be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. On the day Llorens was scheduled to return Sabrina, the mother failed to appear at the pickup site, the FBI said. Llorens had moved from her residence in north Austin and left a false forwarding address, the father's website said. Llorens didn't even contact work when she disappeared with Sabrina Allen, the webpage said. Warrants and wanted posters . Later that month, a Texas warrant was issued for Llorens, accusing her of interference with child custody, and then a federal warrant was issued in May 2002, charging Llorens with unlawful flight, authorities said. Llorens even became wanted by the FBI, which published a public bulletin describing her as someone who ""may walk with a mild limp"" and ""may have travelled to Mexico, where she has ties."" On his website, Greg Allen described her as a thin, petite woman who ""typically does not keep a job for more than six months"" and ""may be likely to take a retail sales job."" Sabrina Allen was listed on the FBI poster as every bit a little girl: 3-foot-6 and 35 pounds, with pierced ears, a mole on her right knee and a small scar on the bridge of her nose. See a copy of the FBI wanted poster (PDF) Her father described her as a cheerful child who liked ""Barbies, bugs, dress-up, movies, Snow White and Scooby-Doo."" ""Sabrina has many friends and a large, loving family in Austin. She is very dearly missed,"" the father's website says. The case briefly came to the attention of CNN in November 2002, when host John Walsh of ""America's Most Wanted"" appeared on the network. When Walsh was told that Sabrina Allen had been missing seven months, he said, ""We have a chance of getting her back. She was taken by her ... mother, and that little girl we may be able to get back. But it's by pictures ... that's how we get missing children back, by exposure like this."" Meanwhile, her father pressed authorities and media outlets about his missing daughter. He even posted photo galleries of him and his daughter on the website. ""This is my school picture. My Daddy says, 'What a big girl,' "" one photo caption says. ""It's my fourth birthday. Who says I'm not a princess?"" another says. Trying to hide in Mexico . While his daughter and her mother lived in Mexico, the girl went by ""Blanquita,"" the diminutive of Blanca, one of the several aliases that Llorens was using, according to the father's website said. The FBI also alleged that Llorens used many aliases. Despite the use of Spanish names, the father asserted that his daughter and her mother would not have blended in Mexican society: Lloren's Spanish was ""poor,"" and their daughter ""does not look at all Hispanic,"" the father said on his website. In fact, Sabrina Allen's middle name is Fair. ""It is unlikely that they could hide in a Hispanic community without standing out,"" Allen said on his website. But Sabrina Allen was repeatedly disguised, right down to her eyebrows and eyelashes, which were dyed, as was her hair, the website said. Sabrina's natural blonde hair was colored red and other hues on varying occasions, the father's website said. As friendly and outgoing as the little girl was, the act of being spirited away imposed an emotional toll on her, the website charges. ""It is reported that she is sometime(s) distant and burdened with the secrets she is being made to keep,"" the website said. ""It is reported that Sabrina has lost weight and is suffering physically and psychologically."" At one point, Llorens apparently enrolled her daughter in the preschool Tegui in Colonia del Valle in Mexico City, and Sabrina reportedly learned how to speak Spanish ""very well"" and to read and write the language, the father's website said. A promising moment came for Greg Allen when Sabrina Allen and her mother were spotted in Mexico City, on June 13, 2003. But they eluded authorities. It would take 11 more years before authorities finally caught up to Sabrina Allen and her mother. What now remains to be seen is how much of her father Sabrina Allen remembers -- and how much of his great hunt for her she'll come to fathom.
