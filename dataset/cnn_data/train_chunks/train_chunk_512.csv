A mother-of-four was beaten by her ex-boyfriend so badly that he left the indent of his ‘DAD’ sovereign ring on her face after the 30 minute attack. Gemma Ford was left with a broken nose, bruising to her neck and jaw plus two black eyes when boyfriend Richard Mullen tried to strangle her and then beat her. When the police caught up with Mullen, 37, the following day, they found an axe and a balaclava in the back of his car. Attack: Gemma Ford's ex-boyfriend Richard Mullen punched her so hard she was left with this 'Dad' imprint on her forehead from his sovereign ring. He attacked her for 30 minutes and left her bruised and battered . Mullen was sentenced to 36-weeks in jail in May but since serving around half his sentence he is free. Mother-of-four Ms Ford has spoken out about her ordeal in order to warn other women about Mullen and domestic violence. Ms Ford said: 'His sentence was disgusting, he should have got at least a couple of years, especially since he has an appalling record of domestic violence. 'I later found out that he was convicted for beating his ex with the same ring he hit me with and she still bears the scars.' Prison: Mullen, left, was sentenced to 36-weeks in jail in May but since serving around half his sentence is free. Ms Ford, right, has spoken out to warn other women about him and others about domestic violence . In May, Lincoln Crown Court was told how lorry driver Mullen’s relationship with Ms Ford, 28, had faltered after she discovered he had been texting a number of his former girlfriends. Ms Ford, from Skegness, broke the relationship off but having believed Mullen’s pleas of innocence took him back. Then, in March this year, they met up and went to a barbecue together where Ms Ford claims Mullen got drunk. Weapon: A similar ring to the one used in the savage attack which left an imprint on Ms Ford for several weeks . She said: 'He was being loud and . overly flirtatious with one of my friends from work and she told me that . he was making her uncomfortable. 'I . decided I was sick of his flirting. He had already broken my trust and I . struggled to believe that he had only been texting those other girls. I . made my mind up to end it with him when I got home.' After . 13 months together, Ms Ford ended the relationship and then went to . bed. But as she was drifting off to sleep Mullen crept in her bedroom . and the next thing she remembers was him sitting on top of her, . squeezing her neck. She said: 'My memory is hazy as I was . slipping into unconsciousness but I remember his thumbs were pressing . against my windpipe and he was saying ‘You b****, you’re not going to . wake up in the morning’. 'At first I couldn’t believe what was happening but then I was terrified. I tried pleading with him but he wouldn’t let go. 'My . only option was to try and reason with him. I told him that if I didn’t . wake up in the morning he would have a dead body and four children . without a mother to think about. That’s when he let go and instead . started kicking and punching me. 'You often hear of people saying that . someone looked possessed, but in his eyes he looked like something else . was making him do it to me. It was as if he had to do it, like something . was forcing him. Violence: The couple are pictured together in happier times. They were together for 13 months until Ms Ford called off the relationship but Mullen attacked her as she slept after creeping into her bedroom . 'It was . such shock to think that this man I had been in love with - and I had . been completely besotted with him at one time - could be capable of . doing that to me. 'I remember him hitting me with the ring and I felt it against my skull. Before he hit me again he took it off.' After the attack, which Ms Ford . believes lasted around 30 minutes, Mullen tried to apologise and cuddle . her but she ordered him to leave. Injured: Ms Ford was left with bruising on her face and neck and said Mullen pressed against her windpipe . The next day she went to the hospital where she was told she had a broken nose for which she will need a rhinoplasty. Doctors . also feared she had a broken jaw due to the amount of bruising on her . face. The bruising from Mullen’s sovereign ring left an outline of the . word ‘Dad’ which was visible for weeks. At . the police station, she gave her statement and then went with friends . to pick up some things from home so she could stay with them. Bruising on Ms Ford's arm. She remembers him hitting her with a ring and feeling it against her skull . She said: 'The police wanted to put me . in a refuge but I point-blank refused. I wasn’t going to do that to my . children and I suppose I also didn’t fully grasp how serious the . situation was. 'Some male . friends came with me to pick up some things and I arranged for my kids’ father to have them for a few days as we share custody.' Just . half an hour after she left for a friend’s house, Ms Ford received a . call from her panicked neighbour and was told how Mullen was hammering . on her door and shouting for her to come out. She called the police who, after short car chase, arrested Mullen and made the discovery in his boot. Bruising behind Ms Ford's ear. Mullen tried to apologise after the attack but she ordered him to leave . Ms Ford said: . 'I don’t know what he intended to do with the axe and the balaclava but . I guess he wasn’t there to apologise. I hate to think what he might . have been capable of. 'Perhaps . he just wanted to intimidate me but after the beating I had received . the night before I think he would have been capable of much worse.' Mullen was bailed but quickly broke his bail conditions by contacting Ms Ford. He was rearrested and held on remand for 39 days to await trial. Ms Ford's black eye is pictured. She also had a broken nose and the 'Dad' imprint was visible for weeks . When Mullen was interviewed he admitted striking her several times but could not recall strangling her. Ms Ford was unable to go to work for two weeks due to her severe bruising and lost her job as a care worker for the elderly as a result of the attack. Mullen, of Spilsby, Lincolnshire, admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm on March 28 and possession of a bladed article. He was jailed for 36 weeks and was given a five year restraining order banning him from contacting Gemma or going within 25 metres of her home. Michael Cranmer-Brown, defending, said Mullen was remorseful for what he did. 'It seems he over reacted at being rejected.' Ms Ford said: 'I didn’t go to the court case because he wrote to me from jail asking me to go. I thought the sentence was absolutely appalling, he has got off lightly. 'I think he is a damaged individual and he needs help to sort himself out. 'I hope that by reading this he knows I’m not afraid of him and I want to warn other women about what he is like and what he is capable of doing.'","Gemma Ford was left with a broken nose .

"The Yahoo CEO is also facing a public backlash after she announced she would limit her maternity leave to two weeks . By . Olivia Fleming . PUBLISHED: . 11:05 EST, 3 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:52 EST, 3 October 2012 . Mogul mother: Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, 37, has asked for baby name suggestions via a mass email sent to colleagues, family and friends . Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer became a parent for the first time on Sunday, giving birth to a healthy baby boy. However the mogul mother is having trouble coming up with a name for her firstborn. The 37-year-old, who has already raised eyebrows after sharply limiting her maternity leave to two weeks, has asked for baby name suggestions via a mass email sent to colleagues, family and friends. Ms Mayer’s husband, San Francisco investor Zachary Bogue, tweeted the couple's news Monday morning, calling their son, 'baby boy Bogue,' before journalist Jeff Jarvis tweeted: 'Just got a large group email from @marissamayer. She’s crowdsourcing suggestions for Baby Boy Bogue’s name! How digital can you get?' He added: 'Just to be clear, @marissamayer says she'll take suggestions for a name. Nobody suggest Yahoo, now!' Pamela Redmond Satran, founder of Nameberry, a database and guide on baby names, told MailOnline: 'I . think people are feeling more overwhelmed... and more determined to find the perfect name. 'As two very busy people who've had a lot on their career plates over the past few months, finding a great name has not been priority one... [they are] just hoping a great name idea will jump out at them.' Ms . Mayer's unnamed baby started making news before its birth, when the then . mother-to-be was selected as Yahoo's new CEO in July - and announced her . pregnancy the same day, making her a role model for working moms. However . she when she announced her intention to take just a few weeks of maternity . leave, she stirred up a negative discussion about what the potential impact on . working mothers might be. As . the face of Yahoo's rebound from . financial malaise and internal turmoil, Ms Mayer's baby name . 'crowdsourcing' will no doubt get people talking . about the search engine and its innovative new CEO-mother - even if it is only surrounding the level of complexity that search engines like Yahoo have . brought to the baby name game. Yahoo and Google are responsible for many frazzled parents who want names that are unique so . their child will rise to the top of future search results - but not so outlandish . that they could be considered strange on the playground. Ms Satran said: 'There's been a . huge increase in the awareness of the power of names, from celebrities and . their babies with unique, attention-getting names to a consciousness of brand . names and domain names. Digital announcement: Journalist Jeff Jarvis tweeted: 'Just got a large group email from @marissamayer. She¿s crowdsourcing suggestions for Baby Boy Bogue¿s name! How digital can you get?' Baby basket: Ms Mayer received a customized Yahoo-themed basket of goodies for her newborn . 'There . are thousands more names in the general lexicon and names move up and down the . popularity ladder more quickly. 'Parents can feel overwhelmed by the . amount of information on names they need to digest, the complexity of the . naming process, and the potential effects of choosing the right or wrong name.' However crowdsourcing baby name ideas like Ms Mayer could be a recipe for paralysis. Opening the floodgates to suggestions from the Internet could easily overwhelm new parents with too many ideas. 'Ultimately, . I do think the decision rests with the parents,' Ms Satran said. 'In the end make your own judgment and keep your own counsel. You can sift through everyone's ideas and advice and then take what makes the . most sense to you.' Happy couple: Ms Mayer's husband Zachary Bogue announced the birth of nameless 'Baby Boy Brogue' via Twitter saying that both 'mom and baby are doing great' Virtual: Mayer retweeted her . husband's announcement that their son had been born on the evening of . Sunday September 30 . While . Ms Mayer keeps the public in corporate baby name suspense, as the working woman’s . celebrity of the moment, some people used the opportunity to criticise . the CEO’s three-day-old mothering skills. Do short maternity leaves have negative effects on the children? Dr. Claire McCarthy, a pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital, tweeted: 'Poor kid,' referring to the notion of crowd-sourcing a baby’s name. Ina . Steinbach, owner of a communications agency in Germany tweeted that . taking baby name suggestions via the Internet 'can’t be a good idea, . ever.' Mary Shank Rockman, a press agent, sympathized with Ms Mayer, writing: 'I had the same problem! Difficult choice & pressure!' While others have slated her work-life balance, saying it sets an unattainable precedent. Opinionated: Some people and publications have used Twitter to criticise the CEO¿s three-day-old mothering skills . Working mothers backlash: Many have slated Ms Mayer's work-life balance, saying it sets an unattainable precedent . Creating discussions : As the head of a public company, and now the face of working mothers everywhere, Ms Mayers will continue to be scrutinized closely . One . Twitter user wrote: 'I can’t see how Marissa Mayer is anything but a . terrible role model for women,' while another commented, 'It's a bad precedent to set, because . not everyone will have the opportunity to send emails and dial into . meetings and still consider it work.' More controversy: Adding fuel to the fire, Fortune magazine has featured the new mother on its current cover mysteriously not pregnant . Allison Benedikt at Slate made the case that Ms Mayer is making a 'huge mistake' in cutting her maternity leave short. She . wrote yesterday: 'She should do whatever she wants to do, but she . should want to do something different than what she wants to do. ... It’s nuts to ignore that there is a BABY involved here.' Amy Coulterman, a communications manager for non-government organizations in Canada, tweeted: 'Stop pretending we can have it all!' Adding fuel to the fire, Fortune magazine, which tweeted this morning 'Marissa Mayer's brief maternity leave: Progress or workaholism?' has featured the new mother on its current cover, out on newsstands Saturday October 6, mysteriously not pregnant. Parenting websites have come out saying it is a 'big diss' to motherhood, with CafeMom asking today whether Fortune magazine thought 'her svelte figure would portray power in a way that her baby bump would not?' As the head of a public company, and now the face of working mothers everywhere, Ms Mayer will continue to be scrutinized closely. She is only three-days in, and already the question on many Twitter users' mind is, 'how will she manage trying to have it all?'",The Yahoo CEO is also facing a public backlash after she announced she would limit her maternity leave to two weeks .

"By . Martha De Lacey . PUBLISHED: . 08:57 EST, 2 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:03 EST, 2 October 2012 . It may be the most dangerous thing that has ever come out of Bedfordshire. A beast so powerful that just a tiny nibble off the end will make your eyes water. Introducing the Bedfordshire Super Naga, the UK's hottest commercially grown chilli pepper, now to be found on supermarket shelves around the country...complete with a warning not to handle with bare hands. Have a bite: Bedfordshire farmer Salvatore Genovese with his powerful Bedfordshire Super Naga, now available at Tesco. Salvatore Genovese, a Bedfordshire farmer who produces an astonishing 500,000 mouth-scorching chilli peppers every week, has unleashed the hell-raising Super Naga, his most powerful variety of chilli yet, and it will be sold exclusively by Tesco. A chilli pepper's heat is measured . in Scoville Units, and last year the 40-year-old farmer produced his notorious Bhut Jolokia, a pepper of just over one million Scovilles that the Guinness Book of Records has described as . 400 times hotter than Tabasco sauce. Genovese's brand new wrinkly little red devil, the Super Naga, climbs the ladder of heat to an almighty 1.12 million Scovilles. The Naga's Tesco packaging is emblazoned . with a six chilli icon warning and labels reading 'Super Super Hot', . 'The Hottest' and, in full block capital letters: 'Warning! Do not touch . without gloves. Skin irritant. Avoid contact with eyes. Wash hands . thoroughly after preparation to avoid irritation.' Go on, give it a nibble: Mr Genovese's Super Naga measures 1.12 million Scoville units on the official chilli heat Richter scale. Inside the packet the guidelines read: 'Use with caution. Ideally used in Bangladeshi dishes, its scorching heat combined with a distinctive fruity aroma makes it the chilli of choice for cooks wanting a new experience.' Ouch: The new Bedfordshire Super Naga comes with a warning not to handle with bare hands. Tesco chilli buyer Gethyn Formby said: 'Chilli fans will love the Bedfordshire Super Naga as it has a wonderful . fruity flavour to match its searing heat level. 'The heat builds slowly allowing you to savour the full flavour. It's very deceptive because it takes a good 30 seconds for the heat to really start working and then it continues to build for a few minutes. 'It's definitely not for the faint-hearted and should be tasted with extreme caution.' Farming has been in Mr Genovese's family since 1972 when his father began growing cucumbers. But 15 years ago the younger Genovese decided to tap in to the UK's new-found hunger for hot chillies, those . little firecrackers which were becoming increasingly popular . and which are now sold at the rate of 45 million per year. He said: 'Until then, generally all the chillies sold in the UK were imported, mainly from Kenya or the Caribbean. 'There was probably a reluctance from UK growers to risk branching out into what was an extremely niche market, but demand has really grown in the last five years and I now produce up to half a million hot chilli peppers a week during the five month season. 'In the last two years we've doubled production of our hottest chilli peppers and I've calculated that one of my chilli peppers reaches one in 200 people in the UK each week.' Scorching: The hottest chilli peppers - such as bird's eye, scotch bonnet, Bhut Jolokia and habanero - are now sold in the UK at a rate of 45 million per year. While chilli pepper culture is rapidly becoming more popular throughout the UK, it's the fiercest ones such as Bhut Jolokia, scotch bonnet, habanero and bird's eye that are growing the fastest. Mr Formby added: 'Chilli pepper culture in the UK has really come on in the last few years and chilliese are no longer thought of as a culinary novelty.' The Bedfordshire Super Naga costs 90p for a 15g packet.","Bedfordshire Super Naga available exclusively at Tesco .

"By . Andrew Levy . PUBLISHED: . 10:02 EST, 2 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:46 EST, 2 July 2012 . Linda Jeffries has been hit by a court injunction which means she could . face jail if she walks her dog too slowly over her neighbours land . As any dog lover can testify, it is sometimes the animal, not the owner, who sets the pace when it comes to walkies. Yet a legal dispute between warring neighbours has resulted in an order stipulating that one party faces jail if she dawdles unduly as she walks her dogs across the other party's land. Farmer Linda Jefferies, 61, was issued with the order after claims that she was using a public right of way to snoop on Pauline Robb, 52, whose land it crosses. But Mrs Jefferies, who is looking at a £150,000 legal bill after unsuccessfully taking her case to the Court of Appeal in London, claims the order effectively bans her from walking her two dogs, in case they stop for a call of nature. The dispute dates back to 2005 when Mrs Robb and her husband Trevor, 55, a full-time farmer, started renting land in West Hanningfield, Essex, where they have barns and an office. They said their neighbour immediately started taking photos and filming them as they went about their business – although they still have no idea why. In 2009, Mrs Jefferies, who rears rare breed sheep, unsuccessfully applied for an injunction, claiming her access to the track had been restricted. This was followed by a four-day hearing in May last year, in which Mrs Jefferies claimed the Robbs had narrowed the route from 12ft to 8ft, potentially restricting access to farm vehicles. However, a surveyor found the track was 13ft wide at its narrowest point and the Robbs lodged a counter-claim that Mrs Jefferies was subjecting them to 'persistent surveillance'. 'Can't live with each other': Linda Jefferies, left, and smallholder Pauline Robb, right, are pictured outside London's Appeal Court. The hostility between the women culminated last year when they sued one another . The couple, who live in a semi in . Chelmsford, were granted an injunction after describing how they were . having to put up with 'intensive photography, spying and eavesdropping'. The order stipulated that Mrs . Jefferies must 'move along at a reasonable speed' on the path – or face a . maximum six-month jail term and £5,000 fine. The order also banned Mrs Jefferies from taking photographs or footage on the 400-yard track. 'Vampire', the Bouvier de Flanders dog belonging to Linda Jefferies, will have to hurry up when nature calls as slow walks could land his owner in jail . Mrs Jeffries also owns a Hungarian Komondor (dog pictured is not the one owned by Mrs Jeffries) The farmer was so incensed by the decision that she took it to the Court of Appeal last week. But Lord Justice Sullivan, who was . sitting with Lady Justice Arden and Sir Nicholas Wall, turned down the . application, saying: 'If you have previously not been passing along at a . reasonable speed and the reason is that you are snooping on your . neighbours, then what is wrong with this order?' Mrs Jefferies was also ordered to pay . both sides' costs. Together with an order to pay both parties' costs . from the earlier hearing, her total bill is believed to be around . £150,000. Mrs Jefferies said after the ruling: . 'I await confirmation of a diagnosis of Farmer's Lung [a respiratory . illness], so the speed that I walk my dogs... will no doubt slacken in . future and I risk the prospect of being guilty of an offence and may be . sent to prison.' Mrs Robb, an accountant, described . herself as 'over the moon' – but questioned why the appeal had been . allowed, saying Mrs Jefferies had agreed to the wording of the . injunction at the previous hearing. And the tussle appeared far from over last night with Mrs Jefferies accused of breaching the injunction. 'I am taking legal advice because she came down the path with her video camera at 11am,' Mr Robbs told the Mail.","Dog walker who faces legal bill of £150,000 after Court of Appeal failure .

The parents of flesh-eating bacteria victim Aimee Copeland spoke today about their daughter's recovery just after she had started her first rehabilitation session, revealing she is determined to walk for her graduation in December. Andy and Donna Copeland appeared on the Today show to talk about the hopes and goals of their daughter Aimee, who was finally released from hospital yesterday, two months after falling from a zip line in Augusta, Georgia. Today the 24-year-old began her lengthy rehabilitation treatment in a clinic where she is expected to remain for six to eight weeks. Scroll down for video . Brave: Aimee Copeland waves with one of her amputated limbs as she leaves a hospital in Augusta headed for an inpatient rehabilitation clinic almost two months after contracting a flesh-eating bacteria . Happy: After nearly two months of battling the rare infection, called necrotizing fasciitis, Copeland was all smiles as she finally left the hospital after having four limbs amputated . Interview: Andy and Donna Copeland spoke to the Today show about their daughter's progress and her hope to walk again by her graduation . Preparation: Aimee's mother Donna helped her daughter prepare for her departure from hospital after two months by putting on her makeup, left, before she posed with hospital staff, right . Her father Andy said: 'It's amazing the things we take for granted, like the ability to get up and go fix a cup of coffee and sit back down again. She has to relearn that ability, to get up and get whatever she needs to satisfy her. 'She needs to be able to have some mobility in her life again but as we speak that process has already started, she is already 30 minutes into her first rehab session.' Aimee was pictured leaving the hospital yesterday smiling and showing off her amputated limbs as she clutched onto a doll. She seemed happy and comfortable to pose with hospital workers as she left hospital and when she was in the ambulance. Her mother Donna told Today: 'She was very excited when we got in the ambulance but it didn't take long before it was lights out. She fell asleep the whole way but when we got there she couldn't wait to get started, she is so motivated.' Proud dad: Andy Copeland takes a photo of his daughter, Aimee, as she leaves hospital two months after doctors said she would probably not make it . Recovery: Aimee's mother said her daughter was motivated to go and get her rehab started as soon as possible and they hopes the clinic could also do something about the pain she is in . The 24-year-old recently revealed to her parents she wants to be able to walk again for her graduation in December. Asked whether or not they think that is possible, Mr Copeland said: 'I believe in the power of prayer, and she is a very prayerful young lady. 'With that behind us coupled with her determination and her resolute will, I believe anything is possible. 'I think we all deal with the emotional aspect every day and I think that's where the family unit comes together as we support each other and she'll continue to need our support. 'That's why it is good she is local and she told us she wants to see us every day. There is nothing more important to us right now than the health and well-being of our daughter. 'She continues to recover and we want to continue to be there for her and I believe our presence will be a mitigated factor in her recovery.' Aimee will spend the next six to eight weeks in a rehabilitation clinic learning to move with the aid of a wheelchair after having her left leg, right foot and both hands amputated. Brave face: Aimee Copeland smiles with medic Kori Mills as she leaves a hospital headed for an inpatient rehabilitation clinic in Augusta Georgia, for the first time since her accident . Two months later: Aimee Copeland, left, with her parents, Andy and Donna Copeland, outside Doctors Hospital in Augusta, Georgia. She was finally released yesterday . New life: Aimee (right, with her sister) had her first rehabilitation session today . Copeland's speedy recovery has defied . doctors' initial prognosis. Her father says they at first gave her just a . slim chance of surviving. She spent weeks sedated and using a . respirator while undergoing amputations and skin grafts to replace . infected skin . Her father Andy spoke to msnbc about how momentous an occasion it was for Aimee to leave hospital. 'I think you could say that she's looking forward to it to the same degree that a child would look forward to leaving high school and going off to college, for her this is a major milestone. 'I would consider it a rite of passage for her as it is the opportunity that she has to actually venture out and relearn her life skills and be able to resume as normal a life as she can have. 'I believe her life can be extremely normal, whatever that word actually means. I think physically she's actually progressed rapidly, certainly far ahead of the doctor's schedule, what they thought she would do. 'I would say spiritually, mentally, psychologically she is so strong right now and for her, to actually be able to grasp the concept that she's lost her hands and feels blessed over that is an amazing thing.' He also revealed they are in the process of making the house 'Aimee friendly' and building an extension onto it to be able to meet her needs. The 24-year-old developed necrotizing fasciitis in a small cut she suffered after falling from a homemade zip line over a west Georgia river. Proud: Her father, Andy Copeland, holds up the photo during an interview with Good Morning America . Mr Copeland wrote on his blog last week that when aimee and her family ventured outside for the first time since the accident, they reflected on the life-changing events - and Aimee showed breathtaking courage. 'I don’t have any regrets about what has happened,' Aimee told her father. 'I don’t focus on what I’ve lost, I would rather focus on what I’ve gained. I feel like I’ve been blessed.' She went on: 'I am blessed to have the opportunity to experience something that not many other people have the chance to experience. Upbeat: On a blog, Aimee's father has said he is amazed by her courage and determination to walk . 'I am blessed to have the capacity to . share my experience with others and have a chance to improve the quality . of someone else's life. I’m blessed to be different.' Speaking to GMA, her father spoke of her determination to walk at her Master's graduation ceremony this December. 'You heard the word right,' he said. 'Walk. That's what she intends to do.' Earlier this month, Mr Copeland said his daughter had been enduring the worst pain of the ordeal. Her agony was so overwhelming that she began taking morphine after initially refusing medication. The . student had originally indicated that she felt a 'traitor to her . convictions' by using drugs to manage her pain, because she believed in . holistic medicine. Injuries: Aimee had her left leg, right foot and both hands amputated. She also lost part of her torso . Much-loved: Aimee's friends and family are praying for her survival and eventual recovery (from left - Aimee, mother Donna, father Andy and sister Paige) She also suffered phantom pains. Mr Copeland wrote: 'Although she has no hands, her brain . is apparently still telling her body that the hands are there. 'I asked . her if she could describe the pain and she told me, ""It feels like I . have been carrying bags of rocks"".' The . University of West Georgia student had to have multiple amputations to save her life . after the small cut to her leg became infected.

"By . Gavin Allen . UPDATED: . 22:21 EST, 17 November 2011 . Ronnie Biggs, who is unable to walk or talk because of a stroke, has finally expressed remorse over the death of the driver who never recovered from his assault during the Great Train Robbery - as he launched an updated version of his autobiography. The deterioration of his health became apparent as he posed for the media at the launch in London, where he described himself as a 'loveable rogue'. Unable to speak after several debilitating strokes, Biggs, 82, answered questions by pointing to a word and letter board. Thumbs up: Biggs poses for the cameras at the launch of his updated autobiography 'Odd Man Out: The Last Straw' in London . The inside story: Biggs poses with a copy of the book, which reveals details of his later life and struggle with ill health . Biggs's compared himself to Katie . Price, saying he was the 'Jordan of the 1980s', and the Great Train . Robber said he was proud of his achievements despite expressing remorse . over his crimes. When asked by reporters how the nation perceived him, Biggs spelled out: 'Loveable rogue.' Son Michael Biggs, speaking on his . father's behalf at the east London launch, said his father had no . regrets about voluntarily returning from Brazil to face justice in 2001. Michael Biggs described how his father developed a life-threatening chest infection every three or four weeks. 'It's a constant battle for my father,' he added. 'This is probably the first and last time he is holding a press conference.' Biggs had been working on the book since his release from jail on compassionate grounds in 2009, the family said. In an interview before the launch of . Odd Man Out: The Last Straw, Biggs expressed sorrow over the fate of . mail train driver Jack Mills, who died in 1970 having never made a full . recovery after being coshed. Great Train Robber: Ronnie Biggs, pictured with his son Michael, spelled out on a word board that he regretted the death of the driver that followed the the notorious crime . Spelling it out: The word board Biggs now uses to speak due to his failing health following a series of strokes . But when asked whether any proceeds . from the book would go to Mr Mills' family, the ex-fugitive's son said: . 'That has not been discussed yet.' The book updates his 1994 . autobiography and has chapters covering his later years, including his . return to the UK, his time in prison, his release on compassionate . grounds and his life since his release. He first suffered a stroke in 1998 and has been admitted to hospital several times since returning to Britain in 2001. Originally from Lambeth, south London, . Biggs was a member of a gang of robbers that stole £2.6m in one of the . most infamous heists in history. The 15-strong gang of robbers raided a . Post Office train from Glasgow to Watford after fixing a red signal to . bring it to a halt at a lonely spot near in Buckinghamshire on August 8, . 1963. When the driver got out to investigate he was coshed and the gang escaped with 120 mail bags of bank notes. The target: The mail train that the Great Train Robbers attacked forty years ago, making off with £2.6million . Death: The train driver Jack Mills, pictured left, was coshed over the head during the robbery and died seven years later, having never recovered from the assault. Biggs, right, lived much of his subsequent life in Brazil . Ill health: Biggs pictured in a Norwich Hospital bed in 2009as his legal team lobbied the then-Home Secretary Jack Straw to release him from prison . The robbery left Mills with serious injuries. He never fully recovered from his injuries, and died seven years later. Biggs says in his new book he is a 'very different man to the one who went on the run from HMP Wandsworth back in July 1965'. 'Not only are there many, many more . miles on the clock, but also there is the damage done to my body and . soul by the strokes and other health problems that should have killed me . already; and may have already done so by the time you get around to . reading this,' he writes. 'I lay no claim to having been a . perfect man who has led a faultless life, and never have, but I am a . better man for the experiences of the past 50 years, a period in which I . spent over three quarters of my life trying to honestly maintain my . family and myself as best I could. 'It has been said by those who don't . know me - and who have never even met me - that I have no regrets, but . that simply isn't true. 'I have always regretted the hurt I caused by my actions, and especially to my own family and friends.' In an interview before the launch, . Biggs had professed his regret by pointing out the words 'crime doesn't . pay' on his word board. When asked if he was sorry for what . happened to mail train driver Jack Mills, who died in 1970 having never . made a full recovery after being hit on the head, he pointed out: 'Yes.'

Would you rather your lover bought you a new diary, learned your language or, er, gave you the earring straight from his lobe in effort to woo you? Or are you the type to settle for a good, old-fashioned breakfast in bed? Well, it seems most of us would rather our beloved ran door-to-door through south London on Christmas Eve looking for us, actually. Happy endings: The end of Love Acturally, once Hugh Grant's Prime Minister has found Martine McCutcheon's Natalie. Love Actually: Hugh Grant's love-struck Prime Minister hunting down Martine McCutcheon's Natalie (both pictured in a car with her octopus brother, Keith) has been voted the most romantic moment in rom-com history. A new list of the most romantic moments in rom-com history has been compiled by romantic social network Zoosk. And indications are that we rate Hugh Grant's Prime Ministerial manhunt for his crush Natalie (played by Martine McCutcheon) at the end of Richard Curtis' 2003 film Love, Actually most highly of all. That moment won 18 per cent of the vote, and scenes from Curtis' rom-coms went on to dominate the top ten list. The moment when Hugh Grant's Will prepares breakfast in bed for Anna (Julia Roberts) in Notting Hill came a close second with 12 per cent; young Sam rushing to the airport to bid farewell to singing Joanna in Love, Actually scored 11 per cent; and Colin Firth's snowy dash to the shop to buy Renee Zellweger's Bridget Jones a new diary accrued seven per cent of the vote. Bridget Jones' Diary: Colin Firth buying a new diary for Renee Zellweger came seventh on the list of most romantic moments in rom-com history. Shakespeare In Love: When Joseph Fiennes' William Shakespeare writes the character of Juliet so that Gwyneth Paltrow's Viola De Lesseps can play opposite him has been voted one of the most romantic moments in any rom-com. Other high-scoring moments on the list include the end of John Hughes' 1985 coming-of-age drama The Breakfast Club when Molly Ringwald's social princess gives her earring to Judd Nelson's rebel after they kiss, and the scene in Love, Actually in which Anna (Julia Roberts) buys an original painting for Will (Hugh Grant). The moment when Cameron Diaz's Amanda rushes back to Jude Law's Graham to spend Christmas with him in The Holiday also features, as do and two further heartfelt scenes in Love, Actually. The first is when Colin Firth's Jamie learns Portuguese to woo Aurelia, and the second is when Andrew Lincoln's Mark confesses his love to Keira Knightley's Juliet with carols and cue cards. The . research was carried out by Zoosk, who interviewed 1174 members. And . films were chosen from the Universal romantic-comedy portfolio. The Breakfast Club: The scene at the end of John Hughes' 1985 film in which Molly Ringwald, in pink, gives her earring to Judd Nelson, top, won a place on the list. 1.

She gave MailOnline her top tips for avoiding romantic bloopers in your own life.... TEXTING . While the person occupies your every waking moment and it's tempting to keep texting them just to make sure they feel the same way, my advice is step away from the phone. Send them a 'thanks for the evening, it was fun' message, by all means, but if you don't get an immediate response, do NOT send another one to check to see if they got the first one or have had some terrible accident. They did. And they haven't. SOCIAL MEDIA . It's hugely tempting to befriend your new beau on Facebook or follow them on Twitter, but leave this for a little while as the relationship needs to find its own pace and this can often look way too keen, way too early . EXES . Past relationships are, inevitably, going to come up as a topic of conversation on the first few dates, but keep it detail-free and as light as possible. This conversation always changes the energy of a new relationship in the early days, and not in a good way.  We've all got a past, some of it fraught with angst, but leave this conversation for much later on down the line. BE FLEXIBLE . It's always good to have a busy life outside of a new relationship; most people like someone who is independent and fulfilled, and you don't want to be seen to be too available. But there are times when you'll need to juggle your social life to accommodate a date, otherwise you'll be booking them in three-weeks-on-Tuesday, thus robbing this promising relationship of any natural momentum.

Former Fleetwood Mac band member Bob Welch has been found dead after apparently committing suicide with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was 66. Police say Welch was found dead by his wife after shooting himself in the chest at their Nashville home at around 12.15pm local time today. The Californian musician had had health issues recently, according to police spokesman Don Aaron, who confirmed that Welch left a suicide note. Scroll down for video . Suicide: Former Fleetwood Mac member Bob Welch was found dead today after shooting himself in the chest . The spokesman would not elaborate on specific details regarding Welch's health - but added that there was no . evidence of foul play. Welch, who also had a solo career, was a guitarist and vocalist for Fleetwood Mac from 1971 to 1974 and worked on albums such . as Future Games and Bare Trees. Ailing: Welch, pictured here in a 1995 documentary, had apparently suffered from health problems of late . He formed the British rock group Paris in 1976, and had hits including Sentimental Lady in 1977 and Ebony Eyes in 1978. Fleetwood Mac's Christine McVie and Lindsey Buckingham did backing vocals on Sentimental Lady. Fleetwood Mac's career took off in the mid-1970s after Welch left the band. Dreams was a Number 1 hit in 1977, and Don't Stop hit the top of the charts the same year. It later became the anthem for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign. Hold Me was a hit in 1982 and Little Lies in 1987. Welch, a native of Los Angeles, scored his biggest hit with Sentimental Lady, which reached No. 8 on the Billboard chart. His other singles included Precious Love in 1979 and Hot Love, Cold World in 1978. Welch fell out with his former band mates after suing the group in 1994 for unpaid royalties, which led to his exclusion from the group's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 1998. 'It basically comes down to the fact that they don't like me anymore,' he told The Plain Dealer of Cleveland at the time. 'I guess they can do what they want. I could understand it if I had been a sideman for a year. But I was an integral part of that band... I put more of myself into that band than anything else I've ever done.'

In 1999 he released a CD, Bob Welch Looks at Bop, a salute to bebop music in the 1940s. Heyday: Welch, centre, was in the band between 1971 and 1974, and was a . guitarist and vocalist.

The father of missing chef Claudia Lawrence has welcomed the 'first sighting we’ve had for ages' after a private detective spotted someone with a 'striking resemblance' to her in Amsterdam last week. Miss Lawrence, who would now be 38, has not been seen since she failed to turn up for work at York University in March 2009. Last night, Martin Dales, the spokesman for Miss Lawrence’s father, Peter, said a former private detective has contacted him to say he spotted someone with a striking resemblance to her a week ago in Amsterdam. Mr Lawrence has welcomed the sighting as a sign that his missing daughter 'has not been forgotten'. Mr Dales said the information has been passed on to North Yorkshire Police for following-up with their Dutch counterparts. In a statement, Mr Dales said: 'We are very grateful to all members of the public who remain vigilant in supporting both the Police and the family’s attempts to find out what has happened to Claudia. 'We don’t know if this is a sighting of Claudia or not but we trust that it will be fully checked out.' Mr Dales told ITV Calendar News: 'The fact that the gentleman in question phoned me up to tell me about this and then followed it up with an email with the detail of the timings, where he was and the fact that his work had been in investigative sort of things means that people are aware.' He added: 'Whether or not it’ll lead to anything I don’t know, but it’s the first sighting we’ve had for ages.'

"Lord Monson says outcome of probe is 'ludicrous' Peer calls for a full murder investigation to be launched . By . Stewart Maclean . PUBLISHED: . 08:32 EST, 11 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:33 EST, 11 July 2012 . Lord Monson has told of his fury after a Kenyan investigation ruled the country's police were not responsible for the death in custody of his son Alexander. The British lord, 57, said it was 'ludicrous' that officers connected to the case had been cleared.He spoke out after the family was informed an internal investigation had ruled no officer was responsible for the death in May of former Marlborough College pupil Alexander Monson, 28. Lord Monson, left, has vowed to fight for justice for his son Alexander, right, who died in police custody in Kenya in May this year . The peer's son died in hospital in the port city of Mombasa on May 19 after he allegedly suffered serious head injuries following his arrest outside a nightclub.Lord Monson today called for a full murder investigation to be launched into the tragedy after a Kenyan CID probe cleared all police officers connected to the case.In a statement he said: 'The Criminal Investigation Department report into Alexander's death is plainly ludicrous. 'If the son of a Kenyan official had died in such circumstances, we would not be where we are now. 'In the face of global scepticism about the credibility of the Kenyan police authorities, we stood back to allow Mr Mohamed Amin, Director of Criminal Investigations, to conduct a full and thorough investigation into Alexander's death. 'Yet his report states he has absolutely no idea how Alexander died.' Lord Monson said the Kenyan police report confirmed the opinion of two pathologists that his son was killed by a blow to the head. Alexander Monson had lived with relatives in Kenya for two years after graduating. He was arrested on suspicion of drugs offences on May 19 outside a nightclub in the coastal resort of Diani and taken to a local police station, where the family claim he was subjected to a violent attack. Mr Monson was taken to hospital hours later and died while handcuffed to a bed. Several police officers from the station were temporarily moved to other duties pending a police probe into the tragedy.However Lord Monson today said the police investigation had offered no evidence on who was responsible for his son's death. Alexander Monson was taken to Diani Police Station following his arrest on May 19, he later died at the local Palm Beach Hospital . He said: 'Mr Amin's report concedes and reconfirms the pathologist's conclusion that Alexander was killed by blunt force trauma to the head and that the government analyst found no drugs in his body.'But it provides no information whatsoever on who was responsible for the fatal injury.'In fact, any detail at all is conspicuous by its absence, despite Mr Amin's claim to have interviewed and recorded statements from 26 witnesses.'Mr Amin even fails to mention that the pathology report stated Alexander had defensive wounds on his left forearm and severe swelling of the groin, injuries consistent with known police torture methods in Kenya.'Lord Monson said his family would fight to ensure his son's death was investigated as murder.The hereditary peer, who works as a journalist, flew to Kenya following the tragedy.In his latest statement he vowed the family would continue their fight despite the police report.He said: 'We have said from the very beginning that Alexander was brutally killed in police custody which is made perfectly clear by the two autopsy reports.'Mr Amin's report only serves to reinforce our view. And yet not a single arrest has been made.'We strongly disagree with Mr Amin's final statement that in his opinion ""the circumstances surrounding the death of the deceased (Alexander) can best be determined by a public inquest"".'What must be conducted instead is a murder inquiry which must be opened immediately and the suspects who were responsible for Alexander at the time of his incarceration must be arrested, charged and tried in a court of law.'He added: 'This is a setback for us but it is not the end of the road.'We are confident that there are people of integrity and influence in Kenya who will help us get justice for Alexander.'If the Kenyan police authorities do not have the stomach to investigate themselves, the case should be handed to another body which does not have existing relationships with the culprits.'A body that is both independent and fearless in its pursuit of the law.'","Lord Monson says outcome of probe is 'ludicrous'

"By . Simon Walters and Brendan Carlin . UPDATED: . 19:44 EST, 11 February 2012 . Speaker John Bercow was forced to act yesterday to head off a threat to the Commons’ daily prayer session. He insisted that parliamentary privilege means MPs’ prayers will not be affected by a controversial court ruling to outlaw them in a town hall. But the current system of daily prayers faces a growing threat from some MPs – including atheists who take part in a ‘sit-down protest’ at each session they attend. No plan for any review of Commons prayers: John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons and Speaker's Chaplain The Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin . While most MPs stand to pray, the rebels remain seated and refuse to join in when prayers are conducted by Commons chaplain, the Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin. The prayer sessions are held in private, with the proceedings never publicly revealed. But yesterday, Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson, an aide to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg who is himself an atheist, admitted she always stayed seated. She said: ‘I sit down during prayers because I don’t believe in God. It’s as simple as that.’ Ms Swinson insisted that her objection to the current system was because MPs had to attend prayers if they wanted to reserve a seat for the following Commons proceedings. ‘If you don’t turn up to prayers, you haven’t reserved a seat,’ said Ms Swinson. But she also suggested that the current rituals should also be changed to allow other faiths to be represented. Atheists: Jo Swinson, left, an aide to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, and Chloe Smith, Tory Treasury Minister, have both revealed they remain seated for prayers . Another atheist MP, Tory Treasury Minister Chloe Smith, broke with convention by refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen on the Bible when she entered the Commons in 2009. Instead, she made a non-religious ‘solemn affirmation’ – though there is no suggestion Ms Smith wants to end Commons prayers. 'Semi-observant Christian': Jo Johnson, the MP brother of London Mayor Boris, says he wants prayers scrapped . But Tory MP Jo Johnson, the brother of London Mayor Boris, echoed Ms Swinson’s call for changes. Mr Johnson is on record as saying that the prayer sessions in the Commons Chamber itself should be scrapped and moved elsewhere – such as the Commons chapel. However, Mr Johnson, who described himself as a ‘semi-observant Christian’, also said yesterday that his main objection was that MPs had to attend prayers to reserve a seat. But Mr Bercow yesterday insisted the ruling by a High Court judge banning prayers recited before meetings of Bideford Town Council in Devon would not affect the Commons. A spokesman for the Speaker said: ‘Under the Bill of Rights 1689, the Commons has the right to decide on its own processes and procedures. ‘It says, “The freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament.” ’ There was no plan for any review of Commons prayers, the Speaker’s spokesman added. Last night, David Cameron also entered the row by insisting the prayer sessions had to stay. A No 10 source said: ‘The Prime Minister thinks that the prayer sessions are very important and that we should keep them.’ And Conservative MP Bill Cash said: ‘The Bideford ruling is bizarre and perverse and sends the message that secularism reigns supreme.’ 'Stand up for our Christian values': Tory MP Mark Pritchard, left, and Labour MP David Lammy, right, both say the tradition of prayer should be preserved . He was supported by fellow Conservative Mark Pritchard, who said: ‘This is more evidence of rising Christianophobia. ‘Fundamentalist atheists are zealots in seeking to untie the Judeo-Christian cords that have bound this nation together for centuries. 'If the courts, bishops and Parliament fail to stand up for our Christian traditions, then extremists parties, for their own divisive and sinister ends, will.’ Labour MP David Lammy also backed the right of councils and the Commons to ‘gather for pray’. Mr Lammy said: ‘I do worry about an aggressive secularism that is drowning out the ability of people of faith to live with that faith.’","Bill Of Rights guarantees Parliament's tradition .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:04 EST, 21 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:02 EST, 22 May 2012 . Fatal attraction: Amanda Logue, who did bikini modelling as well as porn, pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of second-degree murder . A porn actress accused of teaming up with her boyfriend to beat and stab a tattoo shop owner to death after a sex party two years ago has pleaded guilty to a lesser charge that will keep her behind bars for up to 40 years. Amanda Logue, who performed in various adult films under the name Sunny Dae and had also worked as a prostitute, entered the plea on Monday in Pasco County, Florida. Authorities said 41-year-old Dennis Abrahamsen was found stabbed and bludgeoned to death on a massage table in his New Port Richey home in May 2010. The Tampa Bay Times reported that a cousin of Abrahamsen spoke during the hearing, calling Logue 'evil.' Donna Rella said in court: 'You're not a person.''[Abrahamsen] had a family. You have taken him away from us all.' Court records showed that Amanda Logue had been paid to attend a sex party at that location on the night before his body was found. Investigators said Logue and her boyfriend Jason Andrews exchanged expletive-laden text messages before and during the party, discussing the attack. Using his BlackBerry, Andrews allegedly typed: 'I'm so glad you're really committed to this take. Keep eyes for a knife, etc for me!' Logue replied in a nearly incomprehensible text that she was excited - and she wanted to have sex after they killed him. The Tampa Bay Times reported that Andrews pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in January. According to an affidavit, everyone at the party left Abrahamsen's home around 5am May 15, 2010 - except for Logue. Andrews waited outside in his car, still texting her. 'Just get him on his face either bash or tell me to get in and. Where to go,' Andrews wrote.'K I'm horny! I'm getting him to play music,' Logue typed. Killer couple: Logue, left, was accused of plotting the murder with her boyfriend, Jason Andrews, right . 'Wicked. Ill just be waiting. Really. Take. Your. Time,' Andrews replied. Abrahamsen was found dead in his house by a family member some 18 hours later, face down on a massage table with blood splattered on the walls and a ceiling fan. Victim: Dennis Abrahamsen was found stabbed and bludgeoned to death after he hosted a sex party at his home . Logue, 30, who is being held at the Pasco County Jail, originally faced first-degree murder charges, but will now face a lesser charge of second-degree murder in a deal with prosecutors. Police in Florida say the pair killed Abrahamsen in the early morning of May 15 and swiped $6,000 cash, his credit cards and a video camera. Abrahamsen had hired Logue to work at a sex party at his house, and police said that's when Logue and Andrews set him up. They traded dozens of text messages about their homicidal plan, police said. According to an affidavit, Logue would later deny that she had anything to do with the killing and claim Andrews was the one who bludgeoned Abrahamsen with a sledgehammer. 'Logue told [a detective] that Andrews grabbed the back of her hair then twisted her arm behind her back. Andrews forced her to view Abrahamsen's crushed skull and told her that's what would happen to her if she told anyone.' Logue and Andrews met on the set of a porn video in late 2009 and became inseparable - even though Logue was married to a man in Georgia, authorities and friends said. Andrews' Chicago friends find it difficult to believe he was involved in the killing. The 27-year-old Andrews was known in that city as DJ Veritas, and his Facebook and MySpace pages feature several video clips of him playing techno music in large clubs. 'He was a really straight up dude,' said Michael Sarkowicz, a Chicago club photographer. Accused killers: Logue and Andrews reportedly met on the set of a porn film and were subsequently inseparable, often posting pictures of each other on Twitter . Logue seemed like a decent person, said Kristen Cameron, a Florida-based model who met her last year. According to several profiles on modelling websites, Logue did bikini and fetish modelling. 'She was professional, prompt and seemed all around normal, well so I thought,' Cameron wrote in an email to Associated Press. 'She was nice to me and was a great model! I felt a connection to her since we both have southern backgrounds.' But Cameron's opinion changed this spring when she saw how Logue acted around Andrews, her new boyfriend. Side jobs: Andrews also worked as a DJ in Florida when he wasn't doing porn films, while Logue did fetish and bikini modelling . 'Amanda wasn't the Amanda I knew,' Cameron wrote. 'She wouldn't talk, all she did was text with Jason.' Andrews, Cameron said, was obnoxious and brash. He often bragged about his military service, of which Cameron was sceptical. In April and May, according to their Twitter accounts, Logue and Andrews spent several weeks in Florida, shooting porn videos, lolling on the beach and professing their love for each other. Photos on Logue's Facebook showed the pair grinning and hugging.

These are the first pictures of the three-year-old South African girl who suffered burns to 80 per cent recovering after being given a new layer of 'cloned' skin. Isabella 'Pippie' Kruger defied medics after she was seriously injured on New Year's Eve when a container of fire lighting fluid exploded at her home in Johannesburg during a barbeque. She suffered 80 per cent burns to her body and doctors feared she may not have survived. The toddler has been in hospital since New Year's Eve and earlier this month underwent a groundbreaking operation that saw 41 pieces of skin flown in from America to be grafted onto her back, face, chest, arms and legs. Recovering: Pippie Kruger sits up in her hospital bed with moth Anice after undergoing a skin graft to repair 80 per cent burns to her body . Doctors have now said that the artificial skin grafts have 'taken well' to her body. According to Surgeon Ridwan Mia, the operation to graft the skin onto Pippie's body went well. He said that, while there would be scarring, it should be much less than if normal skin grafts had been carried out. So far, he added, Pippie's new skin grafts seem to be taking and the youngster has slowly been woken up from the medically induced coma that she was kept in. Now that she is awake and doing well, doctors are hopeful that Pippie will be able to return home soon. Pippie underwent a groundbreaking operation that saw 41 pieces of 'cloned' skin, which was flown in from America, grafted onto her back, face, chest, arms and legs. Close: Pippie is recovering well after the groundbreaking skin graft to the 80 per cent burns on her body, doctors said . Tender: Anice kisses her daughter, who has been in hospital since the accident on New Year's Eve . As part of a highly experimental therapy, the skin was grown in a laboratory in Boston, Massachusetts using cells harvested from Pippie's body. The skin, which has to kept at a temperature of 2°C to 8°C, only has a 24-hour shelf life and the flight from America to South Africa took 21 hours. It was then whisked through customs and arrived at the hospital just 16 minutes after the plane had touched down. 'Everything . went quite smoothly,' said Dr Ridwan Mia, a plastic and reconstructive . surgeon who performed the surgery on Pippie in a Johannesburg hospital. Dr Mia said he did not hold out much hope for the toddler's survival when he first met her in January. Treatment: The toddler was treated with 41 pieces of skin flown in from America to be grafted onto her back, face, chest, arms and legs . Brave: Pippie has taken well to the skin graft, which was done using skin grown in a laboratory in Boston with her body cells . 'She had swelled to three times her size from her injuries,' he said. Pippie has been in . hospital since being admitted in January and during that time has . battled pneumonia and kidney failure, as well as suffering several . cardiac arrests. Doctors finally stabilised her so that this week's complex skin transplant surgery could be carried out. Dr Mia and his team used enough skin during the surgery to cover a mat and stapled it in pieces onto Pippie's wounds. On her face, doctors used absorbent stitch material instead of staples. The new skin had been created by cloning two samples of skin taken from one of the few parts of Pippie's body that escaped injury thanks to a diaper she was wearing at the time of the accident. Groundbreaking: Dr Ridwan Mia (pictured left) and Anice Kruger push three-year-old Isabella 'Pippie' Kruger into surgery . Under the knife: Anaesthetist Hazir Mukkadim (pictured left) checks Pippie Kruger during her pioneering surgery . The samples were sent to Genzyme laboratory in Boston where the skin was 'cloned' using mouse cells as a 'scaffold'. The procedure has been used many times in America and Europe, but rarely in Africa, Dr Mia said. On Monday evening, a special courier arrived from Boston with a stainless steel container carrying about 30 to 40 grafts of Pippie's new skin. Thin, delicate and almost transparent, the skin was taken to a Johannesburg hospital by ambulance from the airport. The skin needed to be grafted onto Pippie within 24 hours of leaving the laboratory. 'It was like clockwork the way the skin arrived on time,' said Dr Mia. Anxious: Little Pippie Kruger suffered burns to 80 per cent of her body after an accident at a barbeque at her home in Johannesburg, South Africa . Hoping for a quick recovery: Pippie Kruger's parents Erwin and Anice shown with son Arno . As Pippie was wheeled out of the surgery, her father Erwin Kruger expressed his relief to reporters. 'Everything looks great - it's fantastic,' he said. The little girl's mother, Anice Kruger, who has been by her daughter's bedside since the accident, looked equally relieved. For a week after the operation, Pippie will be wrapped in foam and protective dressing. She faces two immediate challenges. The first is ensuring that she remains free of infection. The second challenge is to prevent the new skin from sliding off and not taking. Skin grafts are delicate and prone to tearing. Doctors will have to keep Isabella sedated to minimise the risk of tearing. Bronwen Jones, founder of the Children of Fire, a local charity dedicated to providing medical treatments for young burn survivors, considers Pippie to be one of the luckier burn victims. She said survival in South Africa often depends on victims' proximity to a hospital and whether they are properly equipped. While there are no reliable statistics, Ms Jones estimates that around 15,000 children are seriously injured every year. In impoverished areas, the use of candles, paraffin stoves and open fires are often the causes of fire, particularly during the winter months. Tembisa Hospital, in the Gauteng province of South Africa, currently has 12 children in their burns unit. In the case of Pippie, access to medical care at an early stage as well as her parent's ability to raise money through social networking sites have all helped ease the burden. Dr Mia will be able to tell whether the skin has successfully taken after two weeks but he is optimistic given Isabella's determination. 'She is a fighter,' he said.","Doctors did not expect little Isabella 'Pippie' Kruger to survive after the horrific accident at a family barbecue in Johannesburg, South Africa .

Dominic Lovett, paralysed four years ago, relies solely on a specialist alarm system which works through a phone connection to his live-in assistant in Horrabridge, Devon. The connection is vital so the former signaller can raise the alarm should he have any problems or even suffer a life-threatening stroke.

Gunman Peter Reeve killed himself yesterday on his mother’s grave with the same weapon he used to murder a policeman. The 64-year-old shot himself in the head with a revolver while sitting on his family’s plot in the graveyard of a picturesque village. His death ended a desperate manhunt involving dozens of armed police officers following the murder of their colleague, PC Ian Dibell. Last night it emerged that Reeve was a violent, paranoid and gun-obsessed outcast prone to angry rants. The retired bus mechanic, who suffered from a heart condition, was furious with the noise made by a couple living below his flat and warned friends he would soon ‘kill someone’. Macabre end: A white forensics tent has been erected among the gravestones in All Saints Church graveyard in Writtle, Essex, where the body of gunman Peter Reeve was found this morning . Vital evidence: A box thought to contain the murder weapon is removed from the scene at the church . Probe continues: Reeve's body was found alongside a weapon in the grounds of All Saints Church . He accused the couple of ‘printing money’ and of being ‘involved in drugs’. His threat became reality when he . stormed out of his home ‘firing wildly’ at Trevor Marshall, 48, and his . Polish girlfriend on Monday afternoon. They escaped into the street, but Mr Dibell was killed as he ran from his home to help after hearing the first shots. A friend of Mr Marshall’s stepdaughter Melanie Jacobs said Mr Dibell’s . actions had saved their lives. He said: ‘Our thoughts go out to the . officer and his  family. Suspect: Police began searching for Peter Reeve, right, in connection with the shooting of PC Ian Dibell, left . Swoop: Police and paramedics on scene in the Essex village of Writtle this morning after reports that a body has been found in a churchyard in the hunt for the killer of Pc Ian Dibell (pictured) 'It was a very brave thing that he did. He . didn’t have to do it. If it wasn’t for him, Trevor might not be alive . today.’ Reeve was found dead on the grave of his mother Gladys, who died in . 1985, at All Saints Church in Writtle – 40 miles from the shooting in . Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. His brother Terence, who died in 2004, is also . buried there. Builders working on scaffolding overlooking the churchyard said they . heard a shot at 8.30am before seeing his body slumped across a . gravestone. Neighbours and friends yesterday gave a disturbing insight into Reeve’s lifestyle. Gathering evidence: Forensics officers and detectives assemble at the gates of All Saints Church as they try to piece together the final moments of Mr Reeve's life . Medical response: Paramedics have been assisting the police with their investigation in Writtle yesterday . It emerged he had been visiting a local gun club for more than five . years. Members of the Little Clacton Gun Club said he was known for his . strident views on ‘homosexuals, blacks, bankers and unmarried mothers’. They described him as a ‘sad and ineffective man’ who had become . mentally unstable and recently threatened to kill someone. One man said Reeve, who was not a member and did not shoot, had . attempted suicide twice this year and insisted he was being followed by . ‘druggies’. Questions remain: Police cordon off the area surrounding All Saints Church as detectives revealed Reeve used a handgun to kill Pc Dibell and did not have a firearms licence . 'Strong connection to village': Rumours have been circulating that one of Reeve's relatives may have been buried in the churchyard where he was found dead . Update: Essex Police Chief Constable Jim Barker-McCardle (left) and Detective Superintendent Liam Osborne address the media this morning . Puzzle: Police revealed that Reeve had possessed a shotgun licence in the past, but this would not have allowed him to own the handgun he used to murder Pc Dibell . A former neighbour,  John Molley, said: ‘The best thing he did was put a . bullet in his head. One day my son kicked his ball under his car and he . came out like a maniac and made my boy cry. 'When I went to speak to . him, he would not come out of his house. ‘He kept a shotgun in his house but I would not let him come shooting with me – he was too dangerous. He was scary. ‘He used to beat his wife. She used to come out of the house with tears in her eyes.’ It emerged that police told Reeve’s ex-wife to leave her Chelmsford home . for her own safety as he roamed the county on Monday night. Susan Wood, . who left Reeve ten years ago, spent the night at the home of her . daughter Michelle. On guard: Police at the scene outside the church in Writtle. It is believed Reeve had a 'strong connection' to the village .

Paying their respects: Police officers take floral tributes to scene of Pc Dibell's death in Clacton-on-Sea . The victim's body is covered with a red blanket at the scene of the shooting in Redbridge Road, Clacton . The Police Federation of England and Wales identified the dead man as PC Ian Dibell . Neighbours said Mr Marshall, who escaped with a minor leg injury, was a . driver for Fresh Linen Laundry and had moved to the block of flats about . six months ago. Stuart Griggs, 40, who saw the shooting from his window, said Reeve had . seemed to be a ‘perfectly normal bloke’. He added: ‘A couple of months . ago he started becoming very paranoid about the couple who had moved in . downstairs. He came up to me a few times and said: “I think they’re . printing money.” ‘Next thing he said he thought drugs were involved. 'I explained to him . that the guy downstairs works as a lorry driver and that is why he comes . home at odd times of the night, but he wouldn’t let it go.’ Essex Police said Reeve did not hold any gun permits. Detectives . insisted a ‘live murder inquiry’ would continue despite his death and . said Reeve had no significant criminal past. In a statement, Mr Dibell’s family said: ‘We take some comfort from his . bravery. Ian selflessly went to the aid of people in desperate need, . without fear or thought for his own safety. ‘It was who he was – a hero. He has paid for the act in the most devastating way. He will be deeply missed.’ Police lead residents through the scene near Redbridge Road, Clacton, where PC Ian Dibell was shot dead .

A dazzling white smile is a prerequisite . for any celebrity hoping to make it to the red carpet: they don't . call it a Hollywood smile for nothing. But not every A-lister in Britain is keen to buy into the trend for the blinding white fake teeth that have become so prevalent in the showbiz world today - and motormouth Jeremy Clarkson is one of them. The Top Gear presenter has been voted as having the worst celebrity teeth in the UK after a poll was carried out to discover which famous face had the most discoloured teeth. Top gear legend Jeremy Clarkson was voted has having the worst teeth followed by political Andrew Marr . Racing behind Clarkson in second position was BBC politics presenter Andrew Marr, followed by QI presenter Stephen Fry, then as actress Helena Bonham Carter and funny man Matt Lucas. According to the women polled, brown or yellow teeth are the biggest turn off when it comes to making an impression on a first date. Helena Bonham-Carter made the top ten worst teeth list as well at funny man Matt Lucas . Over half of the women surveyed said they wouldn’t go for a second date with a man with badly discoloured teeth. LoveLite co-owner Donnamarie McBride, who conducted the survey, said: 'If you want to make a good impression there’s nothing better than a winning smile and you can’t have that if you’ve got badly discoloured teeth. Clearly that counts for celebrities just as much as everyone else. 'It’s hardly a surprise a heavy smoker like Jeremy Clarkson came top. Smoking is one of the worst things you can do to stain and discolour your teeth.' Although Simon Cowell has paid a lot of money for his dazzling white teeth he was still voted as having the worst cosmetic smile while Stephen Fry topped the list of bad celebrity smiles for his yellow teeth . Bad cosmetic dentistry obviously runs in the family after Joey Essex and his cousin Chloe Simms were voted as having the worst whitened teeth . It wasn't only tan-toothed stars that were drawing criticism though. The survey also revealed that too much cosmetic work can be as much of a turn off as too little. Top of the list of celebrities who had over-cooked their teeth was X Factor supremo Simon Cowell, who had extra bright veneers done in Los Angeles.

'Combined with the colour it makes . each page have more depth. There are many more things to discover on . subsequent visits to the book that you might not catch first time . around.' The book follows on from 2009's Simon's . Cat: In His Very Own Book (2009), Simon's Cat: Beyond The Fence (2010), . Simon's Cat 3: In Kitten Chaos (2011), and a mini colour slip book, .

Why has Simon's Cat now gone in to colour? I've actually been creating colour Simon's Cat drawings for a while already and posting them on the Simon's Cat website. Colour lets me more accurately portray animals, which are very important to the world of Simon's Cat. Personally I love looking at wildlife and nature, and getting the colours right on birds and other fauna is a great pleasure for me.Why do you think it will be successful? It's not only the colour that I have worked on in my new book. This time around I've spent longer on each drawing which has resulted in really detailed illustrations, much more detailed than drawings in my previous books. Combined with the colour it makes each page have more depth. There are many more things to discover on subsequent visits to the book that you might not catch first time around. It's definitely fun to look through, and I even surprise myself when I spot something I'd forgotten I'd drawn.What is interesting about this film in particular? Without giving too much away, it is a film that shows how a cat's curiosity can sometimes have unexpected results! Are there any plans to make the Simon's Cat films in colour one day? For the time being the Simon's Cat films online will remain in black and white. The films have a signature look and style that people recognise, understand and are comfortable with. The films are short - one to two minutes long - and simplicity is an asset in films of this length. That's not to say we'll never see colour in a Simon's Cat film. There have been experiments... Tofield received his first cat, a stray rescued from a farmer's barn, at the age of nine. He has since had four cats, with the youngest, Teddy, being the primary inspiration behind this new book.

Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are set to go head-to-head tonight in the first live presidential debate of the election season. But the pair's wives have already been battling it out in a quadrennial recipe contest run by Family Circle magazine. Since 1992 the publication has asked potential First Ladies to submit their ultimate cookie dough formula. And after testing both submissions, 51.5per cent of readers opted for Michelle Obama's white and dark chocolate chip cookie over Ann Romney's colourful M&M and oatmeal offering. Top chef: Michelle Obama has been crowned winner of Family Circle's presidential bake-off contest as her white and dark chocolate chip cookie recipe beat Ann Romney's M&M concoction . But Family Circle magazine admitted that it was a tight contest, stating: 'Just 287 votes separated the two women, our smallest margin ever.' Mrs Obama credited her wining recipe to her daughters' godmother and close family friend, Mama Kaye. Sweet treat: Ann Romney says that her grandchildren cannot resist her M&M cookies . She told Today: 'If we want to . splurge, these White and Dark Chocolate Chip Cookies, created by the . girls’ godmother, is the perfect special treat.' Her decadent recipe contains three different . types of chocolate - white, milk and mint - walnuts, two sticks of butter and one stick of Crisco shortening. Meanwhile Mrs Romney's M&M cookie dough, which she claims her grandchildren cannot resist, uses rolled oats, peanut butter, M&Ms and chocolate chips. But it's not just readers of Family Circle magazine that have been casting their vote. Diners at the Occidental Grill & Seafood restaurant, just two blocks away from the White House, have also been asked to give their verdict. For the past two months diners have been . presented with a post dinner Michelle Obama and Ann Romney cookie free of charge, along with a scoring card. The votes have been collected in secret, . and the winner will be announced to coincide with the November 6 presidential . election. A spokesman at the venue, who has tried . both recipes, said it was difficult to select a winner. He told MailOnline: It's hard to choose a favourite because . they're both really fantastic cookies.' From left: Ann Romney's M&M and oatmeal cookies and Michelle Obama's chocolate chip cookies . Family Circle ran its first . presidential bake-off in 1992, when Hillary Clinton’s oatmeal chocolate . chip cookies trumped Barbara Bush’s chocolate chip recipe. Four years later, Clinton relied on the same recipe to defeat Elizabeth Dole’s pecan rolls. In 2000, readers voted for Laura Bush’s Texas cowboy cookies over Tipper Gore’s gingersnaps. And she witnessed another victory in 2004 as her oatmeal chocolate chunks beat Teresa Heinz Kerry’s pumpkin spice cookies. In 2008 Mrs Obama failed to win over bakers with her lemon zest shortbread cookie recipe, which lost to Cindy McCain’s oatmeal butterscotch concoction. The magazine claims that, other than 2008, its bake-off contest has predicted the White House victor of every . presidential election.

As a tourism chief battling one of the soggiest summers on record, Malcolm Bell might be excused for cursing the heavens above. Perhaps surprisingly, however, he also has a more earthly target. For Mr Bell doesn’t just blame the weather for putting a dampener on his year, but also the weathermen and women who predict it. Scroll down for video . Jessica, Sophie, Polly and Emma, from Surrey, enjoy the sunny weather in Brighton, Sussex, today . Whirlpool: The world's largest overflow plug at Ladybower Reservior, near Sheffield produces a torrent of water following the wettest month on record . The worlds largest overflow plug in Ladybower Reservior, near Sheffield, is rarely called on during normal levels of rainfall to prevent reservoir from breaking its banks . Sunny: It was warm enough for Lucy Hood, eight, to splash in the sea on West Wittering beach in Sussex . Forecasters are ‘obsessed’ with rain, he claims, delighting in highlighting the bad days and ignoring dry and sunny spells. And the unusually heavy rainfall has given forecasters plenty of opportunity to deliver the depressing news. Gloomy: Visit Cornwall chief Malcolm Bell says forecasters delight in bringing news of rain . June was one of the wettest on record in the UK, with torrential rainfall causing floods in many areas around the country, and the April - June quarter was the wettest second quarter in the UK since records began in 1910. And now even river-based activities have been affected by the downpours . The latest casualty of the wet weather is the annual ceremony of Swan Upping. The historic event - a census of swans - has been cancelled for the entire week for the first time in hundreds . of years because of the flooded River Thames. The event dates from the twelfth century and should have started yesterday and lasted until Friday. But an announcement last night said it had been cancelled because of the dangerous state of the river. Danger warnings are in place along . most of the Thames from West London to Oxfordshire advising boats to . keep off the river because of the strong stream following recent heavy . rain. The Queen’s Swanmarker David Barber . said: 'It is very disappointing but navigation warnings are in force . along the river and we cannot take chances.' The royal Swan Uppers in colourful . traditional uniforms travel the river in rowing boats from . Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey to Abingdon on Oxfordshire taking a census . of swans, checking their health and marking young birds. Warming up: Sunbathers enjoy the sunny weather on Brighton pier - but it was not quite bikini weather . Warm: Blue sky peeps through the clouds above Brighton drawing sunbathers and holidaymakers to the shore . Splashing around: Ellie Ash, four, splashes in the sea on West Wittering beach in West Sussex today . The Queen still retains the right to . ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water, but only exercises . her ownership on certain stretches of the Thames and surrounding . tributaries. The deluges have also led to the need for regular use of the largest plughole in the world in Ladybower Reservoir in Derbyshire. It was built to prevent the reservoir from breaking its banks by creating a whirlpool on the surface, sucking the water down and through a valve house at the bottom of the dam. Commonly referred to as a plughole, . it measures 24 metres in diameter and is one of two in the three-mile . long reservoir, which is the lowest of three reservoirs in the Derwent . Valley area of the Peak District. A huge chunk of road has been swept away in a landlside just weeks after it was relaid at Seaton in Devon . Fed up: A graffiti artist in Liverpool makes his feelings known about the British summer . The . Visit Cornwall chief believes their ‘flippant remarks’ could cost the . economy millions in lost revenue from tourism, and he says colleagues at . other resorts, including Blackpool and Bournemouth, agree. ‘Rather . than help the public in these difficult and austere times to have at . least some comfort and pleasure in their holidays and free times, they . seem obsessed with making them even more depressed,’ he said. ‘I despair when weather presenters . all too often seem to delight and get excited about poor weather and . skip over the periods of fair weather.’ Presenters gloss over the details of . the forecast, he said, leaving viewers uncertain whether they face a day . of downpours or one of ten-minute showers. Mr . Bell said the tourism industry in Cornwall could lose as much as . £60million this summer, after the wettest April to June on record. Performers from the National Youth Theatre wait in the rain before a rehearsal at the Olympic Village . Fowl weather: The traditional Swan Upping ceremony has had to be cancelled because of flooding along the Thames . He said June’s rain alone brought a fall of around 20 per cent in custom for some businesses. And he believes throwaway remarks by TV weather presenters who ‘try to be stand-up comics’  are the problem. He said: ‘They say things like “we’ll . have our wellies on until October” or confuse showers, which can last . ten minutes, with a rainy day and put people off.’ The Met Office said weather reporters . permanently based at media organisations including the BBC tend to . follow house styles set by the broadcasters. Carrying the flame: Dame Kelly Holmes with the Olympic torch at Tonbridge Castle . ‘I don’t think anyone would disagree . when we say that the weather so far this June and the early part of July . has been rather disappointing,’ it said, adding that it worked with the . tourist industry to provide localised forecasts for resorts and . attractions. One thing which – for the moment at . least – seems to be ignoring Mr Bell’s plea for good news is the weather . itself, with the South West seeing more torrential rain yesterday. Parts of Cornwall have had more than 100mm of rain so far this July, . compared with an average expectation of just under 70mm for the entire . month. Elsewhere, a coastal road was . literally washed away at Seaton in Devon, while Worcester was flooded . for the second time this year after the River Severn burst its banks. An annual sheep fair in Somerset that . has been running for more than six centuries has been cancelled for the . first time ever due to weather. The event, due to have been held on 22 August, would have been the 664th Priddy Sheep Fair. The fair has been held every year since 1348, apart from in 2001 and 2007 because of foot-and-mouth disease. Martin Edwards, chairman of the Sheep Fair Committee, said cancelling it had been 'a really tough decision to take'. The . fair moved from Wells to the Mendip Hills village in 1348 because of . the Black Death, although evidence has been found of a fair being held . in Priddy before that. Organisers said it would take several weeks of fine weather to dry the ground out . Mr . Edwards added : 'We had a realistic look at all the options that were . available to us but, in the end, the safety of our helpers and visitors . attending the fair had to come first. 'We . must also consider that the other fields we use are based on the . goodwill of the landowners, who allow their land to be used for free, . but don’t want to see the fields turned to mud.' Meanwhile, a farmer who set up a . company selling vegetable boxes has suspended his business . 'indefinitely' after weeks of heavy rainfall left fields flooded. The Nearly Naked Veg Company of Avonwick, Devon, was created four years ago and has delivered up to 220 boxes every week. But the weather, along with an . unfavourably long growing season in 2011 and increased fuel costs mean . it has been losing £2,500 a month.

Founder Ben Brunning, 29, said he now intends to concentrate on his wholesale vegetable business. Mr Brunning told customers: 'I have . farmed all my life but I can honestly say this year has been the worst . year in my career for growing horticultural produce.' He said that a mild winter meant . crops had been harvested months earlier than normal, leaving almost . nothing left for the spring. He added: 'Everything has either been drowned by rain or is not growing through lack of sun. It’s very sad. 'But we are not the only guys in this . situation, all over the place growers are struggling and horticultural . crops are failing left right and centre.' But there is some good news on the way - Britain is finally expected to get drier and warmer next week. Tom Tobler, a forecaster with .

The wife of Chinese politician Bo Xilai has agreed to be defended by government-appointed lawyers after being accused of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood. Gu Kailai, 53, known as the Jackie Kennedy of China, and an aide were charged last week with poisoning Neil Heywood, 41, in November. Ms Gu’s decision to accept two government lawyers rather than use her own private attorneys suggests there are behind-the-scenes negotiations taking place between her and the Chinese Politburo, said one expert. Victim and suspect: Chinese prosecutors are charging Gu Kailai (right), the wife of a top Communist Party official, with the murder of British businessman Paul Heywood (left) The state-run news agency Xinhua said Mrs Gu and a family aide, Zhang Xiaojun, were both charged with poisoning Mr Heywood. The charge marks a dramatic fall from grace for Mrs Gu, the daughter of a Mao-era revolutionary hero. The lawyers are based in the Anhui province, where the trial will take place. It is 700 miles east of Chongqing, . where Mr Heywood was found dead in a hotel room and where Ms Gu’s . husband was the Communist Party boss. Murky dealings: Mrs Gu with husband Bo Xilai, the purged Communist leader of Chongqinq, and their son Bo Guagua . Mr Bo was removed from the Communist Party after his wife was arrested in April. He is now under house arrest. Mr Heywood, who lived in Beijing with . his Chinese wife and two children, was summoned to Chongqing for a . meeting last November and was found dead a day later. It has been alleged he was murdered after he threatened Ms Gu’s son Bo Guagua, 24, in a dispute over money. State media said Mrs Gu and her son had ‘conflicts with Mr Heywood over economic interests’ and that Mrs Gu was worried about a ‘threat to her son’s personal security’. Scene: Neil Heywood was killed at the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel in Chongqing last November . There have also been reports Mr . Heywood helped Ms Gu smuggle money out of China, and that she funnelled . up to £3.8 billion to overseas accounts. Mr Heywood also helped Bo Guagua get a . place at top British public school Harrow. He then went on to study at . Oxford and Harvard. There is speculation the money Ms Gu . allegedly smuggled out of China funded her son’s £60,000- a-year Harvard . education and extravagant lifestyle.","Gu Kailai charged with murder along with family 'aide' Zhang Xiaojun .

But she now faces losing her money, which totaled £20,000, after he apparently breached his bail conditions by spending the past three nights holed up in London's Ecuadorian Embassy in an 11th-hour bid for political asylum. Scroll down for video... Supportive friend: Jemima Khan, the socialite and former wife of cricket . star Imran Khan, put up tens of thousands of pounds to help WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, right, meet his £240,000 bail . Mr Assange, 40, is attempting to evade . extradition to Sweden, where he faces accusations of raping a woman and sexually molesting and coercing another in Stockholm in 2010. In a posting on Twitter, Ms Khan said: 'For the record, in response to those asking about Assange & bail money... Plea: Ms Khan said she thought Mr Assange should face the charges in Sweden against him . 'I personally would like to see . Assange confront the rape allegations in Sweden and the two women at the . centre have a right to a response.' However, she added: 'BUT there is no . doubt that Assange has a real fear of being extradited to the US nor . that the US gov is out to get WikiLeaks.' Help: Film director Ken Loach also faces losing his money after Assange apparently breached his bail conditions by spending the past three nights holed up in London's Ecuadorian Embassy in an 11th-hour bid for political asylum . Her . plea came as Mr Assange accused Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard . and the US ambassador to Australia of 'slimy rhetoric', and said he had . received little consular assistance from his home country. The authorities in Sweden want to extradite him to face trial on rape charges, which he has always denied. He told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that he had chosen against going to the Australian embassy after Australian Attorney-General Nicola Roxon refused 'reasonable requests' by his lawyer to be involved or intervene in his planned extradition to Sweden. Branding it an 'effective declaration of abandonment', Mr Assange said: 'There is not a single matter of concern under which the Australian government, as represented by the Attorney-General, would ask other governments to be reasonable or just in this case. 'There are serious issues here, and they are being hidden by the slimy rhetoric coming out of the US ambassador to Australia, via Gillard and by the Foreign Minister - and that needs to stop.' He walked . into the Ecuadorian Embassy in London three nights ago, claiming . political asylum and citing his human rights. Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said the . South American nation would consider 'whether Julian Assange's life is at . stake', before making the decision. It is expected to be made later . today. President Correa also said: 'We are . analysing Julian Assange's asylum request in a very serious and . responsible way. We can't give an official response until the analysis . of his request is complete.' A police source today confirmed Assange will be arrested if he leaves the Ecuadorian Embassy. Attack: Mr Assange accused Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard of 'slimy rhetoric', branding their treatment of him an 'effective declaration of abandonment' There . are currently no arrangements in place to provide him with safe passage . out of the UK should he be granted asylum by the South American . country. Veteran journalist John Pilger said today that Mr Assange was hopeful that he will be able to leave Britain and start a new life in Ecuador. He has been given a 'comfortable room with a computer' and a TV inside the embassy where staff have been 'very hospitable', Mr Pilger said. The journalist was speaking outside the Ecuadorian Embassy in Knightsbridge, where he spent over an hour with Mr Assange. He said that Mr Assange was 'in great spirits' and busy preparing a document supporting his asylum bid, which he speculated could take up to a fortnight to prepare. He said: ""He is in great spirits - he is in unusually good spirits. When I last saw him which was a few days ago he was not in such high spirits. Decision time: Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said the South American nation would consider 'whether Julian Assange's life is at stake', before making the decision . 'He is very hopeful that this will resolve itself, that he will be granted political asylum in Ecuador and that he will be allowed to leave. 'What they are doing at the moment and what he is doing is putting together a major document of the threats against Julian Assange that have come mainly from the US. 'That is absolutely imperative for political asylum. The document will assess the threats that have been made by major political figures in the US.' Mr Pilger accused Ms Gillard of providing 'misinformation' about the support being provided to Mr Assange by his home country. He added: 'I don't think he expects to face a breach of bail charge - this is an extraordinary situation. 'This is a man who has not been prosecuted with anything. He has not been charged or convicted of anything. 'He has spent more than 18 months under virtual house arrest, and he is a man who has the right to the presumption of innocence. 'I don't know how long this will last. I think there is the expectation that something will happen in the next week or two. 'He has a room - the Ecuadorians have been very hospitable to him. 'He has a room, he is in there preparing these documents that are needed for the development if this political asylum case. 'It's not a big place - it's a fairly big room with a computer - it's a comfortable room. 'People are coming in and out. He looks pretty healthy to me.' Mr Pilger would not confirm whether or not Assange has been given a bed in the embassy for his stay. In a telephone . interview with ABC from inside . the embassy yesterday, Mr Assange said he did not know when the . decision would be made. The 40-year-old Australian said there was no guarantee his request would be accepted. He told ABC’s Radio National . programme he was not prepared to go to Sweden because of the conditions . in which he believes he would be held there. He . said: 'The Swedes announced publicly, that they would detain me, in . prison, without charge while they continued their so-called . investigation. 'We had . heard that the Ecuadorians were sympathetic in relation to my struggles . and the struggles of the organisation with the United States, and the . ability to exercise that option was at an effective end.' Protest: Supporters of Julian Assange demonstrated outside the Ecuadorian Embassy, where the Wikileaks founder has sought political asylum . But Scotland Yard said he faced . arrest for breaching his bail conditions – while a list of high-profile . supporters, led by socialite Jemima Khan, risk losing tens of thousands . of pounds they put up to keep him out of jail. The desperate move by Mr Assange, 40, stunned Miss Khan, who confirmed she was one of those who put up the cash for him. Asked . on Twitter whether she was 'on the hook' for his breach of bail, she . replied: 'Yes. I had expected him to face the allegations. I am as . surprised as anyone by this.' Embassies are regarded as 'safe . havens' which British police cannot enter. While Mr Assange remains . inside the building he is safe from arrest – and extradition. He . requested political asylum under the UN Human Rights Declaration, . ironic given Ecuador's poor record on human rights and free speech. But Mr Assange is friendly with the . South American country's socialist leader Rafael Correa. Last month the . Australian interviewed him for his new TV series The World Tomorrow, . broadcast on the Russian state-sponsored Today TV channel, in which the . president – who has clashed with Washington – praised WikiLeaks and the . two men laughed and joked. The dramatic move to seek refuge . inside the embassy came days after the Supreme Court rejected Mr . Assange's appeal against extradition. He was expected to be sent to . Sweden within a fortnight. He denies the Swedish allegations but . fears it may lead to him being sent to the US to face charges over his . whistle-blowing website, for which he could face the death penalty for . espionage.

Doused in a searing chemical; disabled and scarred for life; struck by a depression which can make it hard to go on - the plight of Colombia's acid attack victims is truly heartbreaking. And the number of these horrific assaults is on the rise. At least 250 Colombian women have been disfigured in the last three years, with this year’s victim reports already outpacing 2011’s. The figures have drawn comparison with countries like Pakistan or Bangladesh, countries more notorious for these attacks - as many as 150 Pakistani women are attacked every day, according to the BBC. Victim: Colombian acid victim Maria Cuervo poses with a photo of herself prior to an attack in 2004 that left her disfigured . Yet in Colombia, whose population is nearly four times smaller than Pakistan’s, the attacks are believed more prominent and experts believe there are far more victims out there than reported. 'We know of many cases that were never reported because of threats, because of fear,' 28-year-old acid victim Viviana Hernandez told the BBC. Ms Hernandez was attacked five years ago, leaving burn marks down her face, chest and hands, while also taking away the eyesight in her left eye. She believes it was her former husband who carried out the attack after she refused to get back together with him. He didn't throw the acid himself, she said, but hired the attackers. 'The aim is to harm, not to kill. And to harm somebody for the rest of her life,' she said. Like Ms Hernandez, many are believed victimized by former lovers or some, like former beauty pageant contestant Maria Fernanda Nuñez, who was 22-years-old at the time of her attack, for their looks. Beauty queen: Former Miss Colombia contestant Maria Fernanda Nuñez was doused with acid in 2010 after leaving a pageant's rehearsal with her parents, she's seen before her attack . The former Miss Colombia contestant was brutally attacked near her home following a pageant’s rehearsal with her parents in 2010. Despite authorities in the Colombia city of Cucuta claiming to know who ordered the attack, they said they could not perform an arrest because of a law that required Miss Nuñez to spend a minimum of 30 days in recovery. Miss Nuñez received burns to her face, eye, and parts of her chest and lower body, but had only 20 days in recovery with a doctor. While an arrest has still not been made in her attack, according to Colombia Reports, last May outrage over the episode help lead to an increase in the maximum prison sentence available to attackers. The country's previous sentence to attackers was six months to two years in prison. Commonality: Erika Vanegas, 20, suffered an acid attack by a boyfriend 4 years ago in Bogota, the same city where many others have become victim, and for similar reasons . Under the penmanship of Representative Stella Gloria Diaz, it has been emended to a maximum of 20 years with the attackers also required to provide the victims with protection and comprehensive care. For 51-year-old Consuelo Cordoba who was attacked by her boyfriend 11 years ago - requiring her to wear a mask to prevent infection and a tube to breathe out of her nose - that care would be far from all she has now. Today she walks a market in Bogota begging for change after, like many acid victims, being unable to find work for herself due to her appearance. 'I've thought about committing suicide, yes sir, I've thought about taking my life three times. I say to myself, why live? With a life like the one I have, what for?' she told NPR. 'I had perfect teeth. I was very pretty ... but now, I'm destroyed.' Lasting effects: Consuelo Cordoba, 51, begs for change in a market in Bogota after brutally attacked by a boyfriend 11 years ago, leaving her unable to get a job due to her appearance . Like Ms Cordoba, 26-year-old Gloria Piamba too says can't find work in Bogota and has contemplated suicide after doused with the chemical by whom she says was her ex-boyfriend. Wearing a mask over her mouth, a patch over her eye and a breathing tube in her nose to prevent it from conveying, she recently told a Reuters reporter: 'Who’s going to give me a job looking like this?' But she has a little boy to take care of. - Acid victim Gloria Piamba . She recalls the first time she revealed her face to her six-year-old whose father she says was her attacker. He said: '""Mummy, let’s kill this person who did this to you."" 'He said, ""When I’m older and have a job, I’ll buy you special cream to heal your face."" They're emotional memories that send her into near tears. She said her son still doesn't know all of what happened, but with a psychologist's recommendation, he knows parts. In her retelling of the attack she described it as a mistake: his father mistaking hot water across her face for cold. 'The doctors told me to forget about the face I once had,' Miss Piamba said. 'Those words almost killed me. I thought about jumping off the 7th floor of the hospital.' 'I’m alive because of my son,' she said. 'I couldn’t bear to leave him alone.'","At least 250 women reported victim of Colombian acid attacks in three years .

A 33-year-old woman has died after fighting a flesh-eating bacteria which ravaged her body for a month. Crystal Spencer died at Huron Valley-Sinai Hospital on Sunday night in Detroit, Michigan after she had been admitted to the emergency department of another Detroit hospital with severe pain from a large boil on her thigh on June 30. Mrs Spencer’s husband Jeff believes she contracted the flesh-eating bacteria necrotizing fasciitis at the emergency department at Botsford Hospital in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Death by bacteria: Crystal Spencer has died after contracting a flesh-eating bacteria a month ago . He plans to have an autopsy done to find out how exactly his wife died, his attorney Brian Benner said. Two days after the Farmington Hills woman was admitted to Botsford Hospital, Mrs Spencer was transferred to Huron Valley-Sinai where she underwent a four hour procedure to remove what Mr Spencer called a ‘watermelon-size’ piece of flesh from her thigh. Her condition improved enough to be sent home but she was readmitted again when her condition deteriorated. Legal action: Mr Spencer plans to sue Botsford Hospital where he believes Mrs Spencer contracted necrotizing fasciitis . Mr Spencer said that he will be taking legal action against Botsford Hospital where he believes she contracted the rare infection. Dr Gerald Blackburn, the hospital’s infectious diseases director and other staff had reviewed Mrs Spencer’s case, the hospital spokeswoman Margo Gorchow said according to Detroit Free Press. Ms Gorchow said that the hospital would aid with any investigation into the case but said there were many reasons why Mrs Spencer could not have contracted the disease at Botsford Hospital. Blames the hospital: Her husband Jeff Spencer plans to have an autopsy done to find out exactly how Mrs Spencer died . Ms Gorchow said that the bacteria is usually not contracted in a hospital but caused by an open wound. Mrs Spencer did not present any symptoms of the condition when she was treated at the hospital and she neglected to follow the doctor’s discharge instructions to see the doctor the next day. She was also the ‘classic example of a person at risk’ of infection because Mrs Spencer was diabetic, overweight and a smoker making her ‘more vulnerable’. Not at the hospital: Botsford Hospital officials say that Mrs Spencer would not have contracted the bacteria at the hospital and that she had not followed discharge instructions . According to KSDK, Mrs Spencer’s family were preparing for her to enter rehab until her condition deteriorated suddenly. Eric Spencer, her father-in-law said: ‘I mean she was cheerful and whatever. She was looking forward and on her way to recovery.’ Her husband had said while she fought the bacteria that she only had a 20 to 30 per cent chance of surviving the aggressive disease, and say her Type 2 diabetes has complicated her recovery. Other recent cases of the flesh-eating disease have been reported in South Carolina and Georgia, making this one of the first in the north of America. Victim: Georgia grad student Aimee Copeland, 24, also contracted the aggressive disease after cutting her leg falling from a zipline. She had a leg, the other foot and both hands amputated to save her life . Road to recovery: Aimee was pictured smiling with her parents outside the hospital last week . Student Aimee Copeland had her leg, the other foot and both hands amputated, as well as part of her torso, to save her life. Recent pictures show her grinning in the hospital, and her parents have said she is determined to walk at her graduation ceremony in December. Necrotizing . fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but . extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to . something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy . skin, muscles and fat. The . disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a . minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that . kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms . include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading . bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock . are also common complications. Sufferers . must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given . powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can . become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.","Crystal Spencer died at Huron Valley-Sinai Hospital on Sunday .

Lyndsey Roughton, 27, was twice given the all-clear - but her brain tumour has returned more aggressively than before - and surgeons are unable to operate. Doctors say she has between just two months and two years to live but despite her bleak prognosis, Lyndsey refuses to give up hope. She said: 'I don't really listen to what they . say.

However, in 2010 she was struck down . by a second brain tumour. The doctors couldn't remove the whole growth . so she then underwent radiotherapy. Lyndsey bought a dark wig after . losing much of her hair around four weeks into the treatment. She wrote on her website: 'I knew I just had to get on with it as there was nothing I could do.' Again she battled through receiving the all-clear before Christmas in 2011. But just months later Lyndsey started . to suffer the familiar headaches and sickness. In April doctors told . her the cancer had returned - and this time it was terminal. She was . diagnosed with a grave IV glioblastoma, which is the most aggressive. Lyndsey said: 'The doctors have to tell you the worst and I'm very much about thinking positively. Determined: Lyndsey has raised thousands for her local hospital and took part in the Manchester to Blackpool bike ride with a team of supporters (right) 'I really love my music and I was supposed to be going to Ibiza this year. 'A few weeks before I was due to go I found out about my third tumour so it meant I couldn't go - I have to believe that I'm going to beat it and will spend next summer in Ibiza.' Doctors said trying to remove the tumour this time would negatively effect Lyndsey's quality of life. Instead she is currently undergoing chemotherapy.

He told police he thought Eugene had come from a car on the highway but CCTV proved this to be false.

To his colleagues, Graham Taylor was a trusted member of staff who appeared to be working hard to help keep their engineering firm going. But unbeknown to them, the greedy finance director was responsible for bringing the company to the brink after stealing a ‘breathtaking’ £1.5million to fund his addiction to online gambling. While other staff were made redundant or had their hours reduced – and his fellow directors invested their own savings or worked for free – Taylor gave himself a secret pay rise and gambled thousands of pounds in company cash on internet bingo sites. Only when it emerged that the firm, which was days from receivership, owed £250,000 to the taxman were the 66-year-old’s accounts investigated and the theft discovered. On Thursday work colleagues applauded from the public gallery at Bolton Crown Court as Taylor was jailed  for five years after admitting four charges of theft and two of fraud. Recorder Timothy Stead told him: ‘It is to your shame and discredit that you not only breached the trust of your employers but did so repeatedly. The amount you took can only be described as breathtaking. ‘The money, in very large part, appears to have gone on gambling to which, it’s apparent, you were addicted.’ The court heard how Taylor, who was also secretary  of a local social club, joined  Rochdale-based Nema Ltd in June 1999 as a book-keeper but was promoted to financial director and given shares worth 4 per cent of the company. Mark Monaghan, prosecuting, said the firm enjoyed a period of growth, turning over £3million a year before 2007 when Taylor’s stealing began. ‘It is clear the defendant started to steal from the company to a significant extent,’ Mr Monaghan said. ‘As a  result . . . Nema’s financial position deteriorated significantly.’ Nema Engineering on Lomax Street, Rochdale, where Graham Taylor worked before he was jailed at Bolton Crown Court.

Others had hours . and wages reduced. At the same time Taylor gave himself a . £72,000 pay rise. It was only when a firm of accountants was brought in . that he confessed to theft. Between 2007 and 2010 he had taken a . total of £1,533,636. Although he recouped £800,000 through his winnings . and the sale of his house, more than £900,000 had been lost.

A registered sex offender has been charged with the death of 17-year-old Annette Thur who was raped, sodomized and suffocated more than a quarter of a century ago. John William Kelley, a convicted rapist, was charged last Friday with first-degree murder in the case of the teenager whose body was found dumped down a roadside embankment in remote San Mateo County, California, on December 6, 1986. The 49-year-old man from Placerville, California, who did not enter a plea, faces the death penalty or life without parole if he is convicted. Breakthrough: John William Kelley (right) has been charged with the murder of Annette Thur (left) whose body was found dumped down a roadside embankment in remote San Mateo County in 1986 . The breakthrough in the cold case came after investigators took a sample of seminal fluid from the crime scene and ran it through the state's ever-expanding DNA database, San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said. A $217,000 federal grant allowed the fluid to be retested – and Kelley was found to be the match. Although the fluid had been tested at . the time, investigators had found no match as Kelley's DNA was not in the . system until he was convicted of rape in 1995. Kelley, who has had several run-ins with police, pleaded guilty to raping an acquaintance at his home in Humboldt County in 1995 and received a six-year prison sentence. Justice: Annette¿s mother Patty Dombrowski had waited 26 years for her daughter¿s case to be solved . ‘We are constantly resubmitting things because the database changes,’ San Mateo County Sheriff's Lt. Larry Schumaker told the Santa Cruz Sentinel. Kelley had also been convicted of . statutory rape and sexual battery in 1986, just three months before . Annette’s murder. But that charge only led to a three-month sentence and . three years’ probation. Annette’s mother Patty Dombrowski has waited 26 agonizing years for her daughter’s case to be solved. The 59-year-old from Waynesville, Georgia, could not stop crying when she found out that a suspect had been arrested. Location: Thur's body was found was found by a passerby along a remote stretch of Skyline Boulevard near Alpine Road in the Santa Cruz Mountains, California . ‘It's like a dark Christmas. It's sad,’ the mother who sleeps beside a photo of Annette told the San Mateo County Times. ‘I have waited all these years for the person who did this, for the animal who attacked and killed my child to face any kind of consequences. It's incredible.’ Her daughter's horrifying ordeal occurred in the early hours of December 6 when Annette was trying to hitchhike home after a party. That is when Kelley kidnapped the teenager, and raped, sodomized and suffocated her at his home before dumping her body. Her corpse was found by a tourist that same day. Kelley remains in San Mateo County jail without bail and is scheduled back in court August 28 to enter a plea.","Annette Thur, 17, was hitchhiking home when John William Kelley kidnapped and raped her on December 6, 1986 .

A leading French politician plotted to wreck a rival's career by luring him into having sex with an underage girl in Morocco, it was claimed today. Senator Jean-Louis Masson has accused fellow senator Francois Grosdidier of hatching the plan to have him expelled from France's upper house of parliament. He claims to have a tape recording in which 52-year-old Grosdidier plots with a pal to frame him with the bizarre honeytrap. J'accuse! French senator Francois Grosdidier (left) is accused of trying to have fellow senator Jean-Louis Masson (right) expelled from France's upper house of Parliament by using an underage girl as a honeytrap. 'We'll catch him like a rabbit': The pair plotted to trap the rival in Morocco (pictured) Both men are right wing UMP senators in the eastern department of Moselle and are said to have been feuding with each other for two decades. The rivalry - dubbed Dallas in Moselle by the French media - is said to have begun in the 1990s over council tenders for work in their neighbouring constituencies. Masson, 65, said the recording was passed onto him by 'an associate' two years ago, but he had decided not to make it public until now. On the tape which Masson has now released to the French media, Grosdidier is heard telling another man: 'That's the only thing that's left for us to do: trick him with a minor.' Had the set-up had been successful, it would have resembled the case of former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi (left), who had sex with Moroccan belly dancer Karima El Mahroug (right) The second man replies: 'Let's go for Morocco, we'll catch him like a rabbit.' Grosdidier answers: 'As soon at the story gets out, I'll get in touch with the state secretary at the ministry of the interior and tell him, 'Listen, don't protect him, he's the worst half-assed French politician.' Masson alleges that several months later he was contacted by an 'unknown businessman' who invited him on a free holiday to Morocco. Grosdidier has not denied the recordings are real, but told France's 20 Minutes news website the conversation was a 'schoolboy prank'. He added: 'A couple of years ago I was speaking with an accountant about my conflict with Masson and he came up with this absurb proposition. 'I went along with the conversation for a joke. It meant nothing. We were just larking around.' Masson has filed a lawsuit against his rival for conspiracy, while Grosdidier has struck back with a suit for slander, manipulation and conspiracy. Had the set-up had been successful, it . would have bore similarities to Italian Prime Minister Silvio . Berlusconi, who had sex with a teenage prostitute.

Scandalous: A vulnerable boy, aged 15, was taken to a brothel to have sex with prostitutes by his carer who was supposed to getting him used to everyday life outside a mental health unit (file photo) But while taking the boy on trips outside, he allegedly pointed out a massage parlour and took him there three times. The boy's father, 51, said: 'My lad didn't have a clue about prostitutes or where to find them. 'He told me his carer showed him the way. 'He paid for sex using the £20-a-week pocket money he'd saved up for trips outside.' 'I understand his carer left my son to it after dropping him off at the massage parlour.'

Five Australian soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan in the nation's deadliest day in combat since the Vietnam War. Three servicemen died in an 'insider attack' by an Afghan solider, which brought to the number of Australian lives lost in the conflict to 38. 'This is a very big toll... this is our single worst day in Afghanistan,' said Prime Minister Julia Gillard today. 'Indeed this is the most lost in combat since the days of the Vietnam War.' Scroll down for video . Green on blue: Three soldiers were killed in an 'insider attack' by Afghan troops - taking the Australian death toll in the country to 38 . She has cut short a trip to the Pacific Islands Forum to return home and deal with the fallout from the tragic events overseas. Australia's acting defence chief Air Marshal Mark Binskin said the first incident occurred at a patrol base near Tirin Kot in the southern Uruzgan province, where about 1,500 Australian troops are deployed. In the second, two Australian special forces soldiers were killed when their helicopter crashed in Helmand province. 'Three Australian soldiers from the 3RAR task group were shot and killed when an individual wearing an Afghan National Army uniform opened fire with an automatic weapon from close range,' he told reporters. The dead soldiers were aged 40, 23, and 21 and had been relaxing at the end of the day when the Afghan opened fire, he added. 'Worst day': Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard cut short a trip to the Pacific Islands Forum to return home and deal with the fallout. General Abdul Hamid Hamid, an Afghan army commander in the south of the country, suggested it may have been a case of mistaken identity. 'Last night at around 10.30pm an Australian forces patrol on foot wanted to enter an Afghan army camp in Chora district of Uruzgan province,' General Hamid told AFP in Afghanistan. 'An Afghan army soldier who was on duty at the gate of the camp thought they were enemy forces so he opened fire at them killing three Australian soldiers. 'He has probably mistakenly fired on foreign soldiers thinking they were militants,' he added, saying the soldier, named Hekmat, had been serving in the army in Uruzgan for around five months and fled after the shooting. NATO has struggled to counter the so-called 'green-on-blue' attacks, in which uniformed Afghans turn their weapons against their international allies. The assaults have spiked this year, with more than 30 attacks claiming the lives of 45 coalition troops, comprising about 14 per cent of the overall death toll in the war for 2012, according to ISAF. The latest deaths make up the third 'green-on-blue' incident involving Australian soldiers, which Ms Gillard admitted were making it difficult to build trust between Australians and the Afghans they are training. 'It is really difficult for our soldiers in the field,' she said, but insisted she still had faith in the progress Australian troops were making in Afghanistan. Australia is a close ally of the United States and its Afghan deployment began in 2001. Canberra later pulled out, only to redeploy in 2005. Australia announced this year that it would begin withdrawing its forces in 2013, earlier than planned due to significant security gains and increased pressure on the government over the long-running Afghan campaign.

Sally Bercow’s appearance on 2011’s Celebrity Big Brother raised more than a few eyebrows and caused many to question her hunger for fame and her commitment to husband speaker John Bercow. But today in a joint TV interview about their son Oliver’s autism Sally insists she has no regrets about taking part in the show that made £100,000 for charity. Talking to Lorraine Kelly this morning about how her eight-year-old son inspired her to take part and raise money for autism charity, Ambitious about Autism, Labour activist Sally says: “That was why I did it. There's no secret that John didn’t approve of me doing it. Raising awareness: Sally and John Bercow appear on the Lorraine show to talk about their son's autism . 'I think he had visions of George Galloway dancing like a cat and thinking that I would do the same kind of thing. But it was a lot of money and to me, I just felt that I couldn’t turn down that kind of money, so I have no regrets about doing it.' Husband John adds: “And it was very much Sally’s decision. I'm not going to be a hypocrite and pretend that I was keen on the idea. I thought that the programme presented hazards for her and for me, but the fact is I have always accepted that she was a free agent and that she was entitled to do it if she wanted to do so. 'And did she do well on the programme? She did. And did she raise a fortune? She did. And did she do so for a magnificent charity, Ambitious about Autism? She did. And I'm very proud of her for that.' Mr & Mrs Speaker: Sally and John arrive at the ITV studios ahead of their first joint TV interview . John and Sally’s eldest son Oliver was diagnosed with autism when he was just two. Now eight-years-old Oliver goes to a mainstream school but has a special teaching assistant.John  says: ‘He’s doing fantastically and he’s a delightful little boy. But of course it is a lifelong condition. It’s a spectrum condition, so there are all sorts of variants on the theme of autism. 'Some people are more severely affected than others, but he does experience difficulties in social communication and difficulties with social imagination and difficulties with social interaction. 'And that will remain true lifelong, and the challenge is to find ways of addressing the difficulty and enabling him to make friends, to fulfil his potential and to enjoy life.' VIPS: The couple were guests of Kate Middleton and Prince William at the Royal Wedding last year . The couple are hoping that talking about their son Oliver’s condition can help raise awareness of autism, which affects one person in every hundred.Talking about identifying the disorder as an infant mother-of-three Sally says: 'He was developing at a slower than normal rate and everybody was sort of saying, ‘He’ll pick up, it’s just a different shade of normal essentially.’ But I just knew that there was something wrong with him.'John adds: 'To get confirmation and to get the label was actually useful, because apart from anything else it was the root to the sort of assistance and support he needed.'Blonde Sally is still courting controversy, mostly with her indiscreet tweets, but husband John doesn’t want to be her sensor. He says: . She is strong-willed, but I reiterate the basic point – strong willed here in support of a fantastic cause. 'We want to raise awareness of autism, we want to show people that they needn’t feel lonely and isolated and confused, that there can be help and that there are organisations that can provide that help.'

Fizzy drinks and high-fat foods are building up a 'ticking time bomb of health problems' People in their 30s could suffer strokes and dementia because of their junk food diets, scientists claim. Researchers said a so-called ‘cafeteria diet’ rich in high-calorie, high-sugar and high-salt foods, creates a 'ticking time bomb of health problems'. This dramatically increases the chance of both falling ill and dying at a younger age. A trial involving sedentary rats fed a . common junk food diet of biscuits, sausages, cupcakes and sugar-laden . soft drinks showed they suffered high levels of cholesterol, blood . sugar, blood pressure and obesity after just two months. The . animals were at an age roughly equivalent to 16 to 22 years in humans . at the time of disease onset, according to lead researcher Dr Dale . Corbett, scientific director of the Heart and Stroke Foundation Centre . for Stroke Recovery in Ottawa, Canada. He . said: 'I think we’ll soon start to see people in their 30s or 40s . having strokes, having dementia, because of this junk food diet. Young . people will have major, major problems much earlier in life.' During the laboratory test, the rats had unlimited amounts of nutritional food pellets and common junk food items, but 'greatly preferred' the latter. Dr Corbett highlights the importance of preventing stroke and heart disease with regular exercise and a balanced diet. He said: 'If we continue to live and eat like this, then we’re each a ticking time bomb of health problems.' Dr Mark Bayley, co-chair of the Canadian Stroke Congress and Medical Director of the Neurological Rehabilitation Program in Toronto, said: 'We cannot afford to continue making poor nutritional choices. Our diet is killing us.' In addition to warning about the health dangers of a poor diet, the study opens the door to further research. Dr Corbett said: 'Laboratory models often use relatively young animals who are healthier and on better diets than we are. 'However, it is important to remember that for many people, the consequences would be even worse, since a lot of people with stroke also have pre-existing health problems.'

"By . Daniel Bates . UPDATED: . 10:31 EST, 24 January 2012 . Mitt Romney gravely offended a second female Mormon worshipper who came to him for advice about a birth, according to a new biography. The Republican presidential front runner told the unnamed woman that the interests of her child were more important than her own welfare, even though the birth could have serious complications. It had already been reported her threatened a first woman with excommunication unless she gave her baby up for adoption. 'Cold': Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney is so awkward when dealing with the public that he seems almost robotic, a new book claims . The book also alleges that Romney . told another of his congregation who had progressive views that she was . 'not my kind of Mormon'. And in a brutal assessment from one . of his own friends, he was deemed so emotionally cold that he was given . the nickname 'The Tin Man’, the robot in The Wizard of Oz who does not . have a heart. The biography, called ‘The Real . Romney’, is written by Boston Globe investigative reporters Michael . Kranish and Scott Helman who spent five years interviewing hundreds of . his friends and acquaintances. It portrays Romney as overly cautious . and paranoid he will make mistakes like his politician father George . once did during his failed bid for the presidency in 1968. They write: ‘If George Romney shot . from the hip, his son, before he shoots at all, carefully studies the . target, lines up the barrel just right, and might even fire a few . practice rounds.’ Romney’s public image is one of ‘brittleness of his self-certainty’ and even his own allies see he has major problems. Heartless: Friends call him 'The Tin Man' after the Wizard of Oz character with no heart, according to the book . A memo drafted by his own media team . during his failed bid for the White House in 2008 lists his one his main . problems as: ‘Perception - phony’. The list also includes the words ‘Slick - not human (hair?)’ and says there is ‘no story behind cold business’. The most damning insights come from Romney’s friends and one business partner who dubbed him ‘The Tin Man’. But even a former aide says he has a . ‘mask’ that he would put on in public and that there is an ‘invisible . wall between ""me"" and ""you""'. Part of his distance is to do with . his faith but part of it is because he just can’t relate to people who . ‘haven’t swum in the same rarefied waters he has’, the book says. It has already been reported that . Romney urged one of his Mormon followers in the 1980s to put her unborn . child up for adoption or face excommunication from their church. But Kranish and Helman say that in a . second instance he left another one of his followers feeling deeply hurt . over a similar predicament. The unnamed woman was facing an . unplanned sixth pregnancy but she had a dangerous blood clot and the . baby only had a 50/50 chance of survival, which she hoped would be . enough for Romney to sanction an abortion. But when he came to see her in hospital, he told her: 'As your bishop, my concern is with the child'. She went against his word, had the abortion and did not look back. Limited success: The book says there is no way to prove the claim by . Romney, pictured working at Bain & Company, that he created . thousands of jobs there . But she said: 'What I feel bad about . is that at a time when I would have appreciated nurturing and support . from spiritual leaders and friends, I got judgement, criticism, . prejudicial advice and rejection'. Romney’s behaviour around his Mormon . followers was called into question a third time by Judy Dushku, a . well-known progressive member of the faith. She wanted to visit the Mormon temple . outside Washington, a sacred rite that commits Mormons to a lifetime of . worship, but first she needed Romney’s permission as her local leader. During their conversation he . supposedly suddenly on her turned and said: ‘’Well Judy, I just won’t . understand why you stay in the church’. Revelations: The Real Romney, written by two Boston Globe reporters, is published Tuesday . 'She asked him whether he wanted her . to really answer that question. ‘And he said: ‘No, actually I don’t . understand why you do. But I can tell you one thing. You’re not my kind . of Mormon"". Romney has long faced accusations he . is not personable enough to become president but the disclosure that . even those close to him agree could be particularly damaging. Yet the book’s attack does not stop . there and calls into question Romney’s business record, a key part of . his presidential campaign. They claim that there is no way to . prove his claim that he created tens of thousands of jobs whilst working . at private equity company Bain Capital in the 1980s. The book says: ‘Many companies that Romney held briefly were in private hands and changed owners numerous times. ‘They were saddled with debt, . restructured, and split up. Some companies under Romney’s control . prospered, and some failed; some produced new jobs, and others shut down . and left people out of work.’ Kranish and Helman point out that, . contrary to what Romney has claimed in his current presidential . campaign, he did not start Bainl ‘with a few friends’ in a small office. In fact it was a ‘nearly risk free . opportunity with substantial financial backing - and a lucrative . fallback plan in case of failure,’ they write. The myth that he was a small business . owner sounds better on the campaign trail than the reality of a . multi-million dollar private equity firm, which makes him seem even more . aloof. In other chapters the authors explore . Romey’s ‘zany’ side, which will be a gift to Newt Gingrich, who is . second behind him in the polls. Romney used the same word earlier in . the campaign to attack Gingrich’s views that mankind should harvest . minerals from the Moon and get pupils to be school janitors. The book details how Romney often pretended to be cartoon characters in letters home to his family in an attempt to be humorous. Once at his home in Belmont, . Massachusetts, in the 1980s, Mormon counsellor Philip Barlow and another . man were visiting when they casually mentioned Michael Jackson. Mr Barlow said: ‘He (Romney) just . said: ‘Oh yeah!’ and he stood up theatrically and started to ooze out a . pretty credible rendition of ‘Billie Jean’ and moonwalked gracefully . backwards.’ He could not believe what he had just seen.’ As a teenager at Cranbrook school in . Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, one of the most prestigious boarding schools . in the country, Romney honed his skills as a prankster. He once staged an ‘elaborate formal . dinner’ in a busy corridor and another time impersonated a cop, . something that would have got him into serious trouble if he had been . caught. On that occasion dressed up in a . uniform similar to a policeman, put a siren on top of his car and chased . two of his friends who were driving around with their dates. His friends were in on the plot but the women had no idea. When Romney flagged them down he . discovered some beer in the trunk as they had agreed would happen - but . then they drove off when he told them to get out of the car.

Romney had been entrusted with . stopping students from stealing the ceremonial axe in the run up to the . annual Stanford vs Berkley football game - the tradition was for . somebody to make off with it. He heard that there was a rally in . Berkley and became convinced it was a plot ,so ditched his shirt and tie . and borrowed some faded Levis, moccasins and a wool work jacket to . blend in.

The jury heard part-time DJ Denver White became as popular as Madonna after fraudsters downloaded his songs in a £1m scam on iTunes and Amazon . A part-time DJ from Wolverhampton became as popular as Madonna after fraudsters downloaded his songs in a £1million swindle on iTunes and Amazon, a court heard today. Denver White, 26, sold so many tracks he featured in the download sales charts after thousands of stolen credit cards were used to buy his music. White - known as DJ Denver - and 11 others were involved in the scam which cost iTunes and Amazon up to £1million in royalties that were paid to the musician for each download. Gang members used at least 24 laptops . loaded with sophisticated software designed to disguise their location . and bought music with stolen credit card details. Through . Tunecore, CD Baby, and SongCast they uploaded about 20 tracks produced by White . and a number of other artists to fleece iTunes and Amazon between . January 2008 and June 2009. Jurors heard eleven others including the 'main man' Craig Anderson, 24, have admitted their involvement in the con. Prosecutor . Helen Malcolm QC said: 'It was a fraud on both iTunes and Amazon and, . between them, these companies lost between £750,000 and £1million to a . collection of lads based principally in Wolverhampton. 'The main man and the main beneficiary was a man called Craig Anderson.' Anderson and fellow fraudsters discovered they could upload songs via agents on to iTunes and Amazon. 'They then bought a number of, at . least 24, identical laptops and they got hold, in due course, of . something called ""Hide My IP"" which was intended to disguise where the . downloads were being carried out from,' Miss Malcolm said. 'They . got hold of literally thousands and thousands of compromised credit . card details, both from America and the UK, and they used those cards to . download their own music from iTunes and Amazon. 'Every time they downloaded their own music an amount of royalties was generated. Through Tunecore, CD Baby, and SongCast they uploaded about 20 tracks produced by White and a number of other artists to fleece iTunes and Amazon between January 2008 and June 2009 . 'For each download the amount was very small but, by the time you add it up to hundreds and hundreds of thousands of downloads the amount is quite high. 'They were caught, really, for two reasons; principally because they were greedy and also because the Hide My IP software did not work as they had hoped. 'The police were able to track them through PayPal accounts and email address out to the bank accounts of the 12 people. 'In all they obtained £500,000 before they were stopped.' Miss Malcom added: 'Why the difference between £1million and £500,000? 'iTunes and Amazon lost the whole amount because they had to repay the genuine card holders the whole amount. 'The royalty payments were, by definition, going to be a portion of that. 'The total amount lost is greater than the total amount of benefit that was obtained.' White was a part-time DJ in the Wolverhampton area and not a 'big time rockstar'. 'Somebody at iTunes noticed that a complete unknown from Wolverhampton called DJ Denver, also known as Denver White, operating entirely on his own, rather than through a record company and without any marketing that anybody could see, was selling so much on iTunes that his name featured in the volume sales charts,' said Miss Malcolm. Denver White sold as many downloads as pop queen Madonna as part of the alleged scam, jurors heard . 'He was selling so much and earning so much in the way of royalties he was selling at a rate you would expect from the likes of Madonna.' Three other men James Batchelor, 39, Sheehan Steele, 43, and Michael Clarke, 32, were also said to be involved. The jury was told that after the fraud was discovered royalty payments were stopped White's music was removed from the site and £113,000 was withheld. Miss Malcolm said: 'Shortly after they were stopped Tunecore started to get a number of calls and emails from a man calling himself Daniel Thompson. 'Daniel Thompson demanded payment of the outstanding royalties. 'What he did not know was that Tunecore knew there was a fraud and they were in touch with US law enforcement. 'Tunecore hoped to persuade him to identify himself by persuading him to come to New York to collect his royalties. 'They said they were unable to pay that amount of money for tax reasons and he needed to come to New York. 'They offered to send him free air tickets and put him up. 'At that stage Thompson said that the tickets would have to be sent in the name of Denver White and he gave Denver White's real name and real address for the tickets to be posted to. 'That gave the authorities the name of Denver White and further investigation and tracking of where the money had gone to led to the uncovering of all 11 other defendants apart from Denver White, all of whom have been before the court.' White denies one count of conspiracy to defraud between January 2008 and June 2009. The trial continues.","Denver White and 11 others downloaded music with stolen credit cards, court hears .

Desperate Scousewives star Layla Flaherty, ran up a £203,948.80 bar bill . A self-proclaimed financial whizz-kid who shot to notoriety after spending more than £200,000 on drinks in one night has been arrested. Foreign currency trader Alex Hope, 23, is being held on suspicion of unauthorised trading after the City watchdog alerted police. Hope racked up the huge bar tab – larger than the value of the average family home – in a Liverpool nightclub last month. The bill included £125,000 for a giant bottle of champagne. The raid, by City of London police and authorised by the Financial Services Authority, took place at a property in East London on Tuesday. If charged and found guilty, Hope could face jail. City rules state that, while Hope is allowed to trade currencies – converting pounds into dollars or euros and vice versa – to make a profit for himself, he must have a licence from the FSA to work on behalf of others. Such a licence can cost £1,000 a year. Hope was catapulted into the media spotlight last month thanks to his astonishing drinks bill at the PlayGround nightclub in Liverpool’s Hilton hotel, where he is said to have entertained Wayne Rooney’s wife, Coleen, and Manchester City star and Adam Johnson.He spent £125,000 on a double Nebuchadnezzar of Armand de Brignac champagne – the equivalent of 40 ordinary bottles. It weighed 99lb and had to be carried by two waiters. The tab also included 40 bottles of Ace of Spades champagne, along with £4,000 worth of Grey Goose vodka. Along with a 10 per cent service charge of £18,540, the total bill was £203,948.80.

A registry office marriage ceremony was revealed to be a sham just moments after the ceremony finished when the bride and groom hastily removed their wedding rings, a court has heard. Instead of exchanging kisses, the bride Marcela Tancosova and the groom Choudry Kanwal took off the rings and handed them to a guest at the Sheffield ceremony. But unfortunately for them the moment was captured by CCTV cameras and it led to the couple, from Slovakia and Pakistan respectively, being arrested for a fake marriage. 'Bride' Marcela Tancosova, right, and Choudry Kanwal, left, were sentenced for their roles in the sham marriage . Further investigations revealed that Tancosova, 35, was pregnant by another man, she had a husband back in her home country and lived with another Slovakian man who was in prison at the time. The couple could only communicate using sign language. Jailing the bride for 12 months at Sheffield Crown Court, Judge Peter Kelson told Tancosova: 'There was little better evidence than (that) as you left the Register Office the CCTV showed you and your false husband immediately took off your rings and handed them to somebody else. The court heard that her co-defendant Sajid Mehmood, 38, had previously 'fixed' three sham marriages in Sheffield. When he was arrested over one of them, a 'shopping list' was found in his car along with a cheap wedding ring. The incriminating list, which was written in Urdu, read: 'Girl £4,500; P60 £1,900; wedding permission £600; wedding expenses £200; Home Office £2,100.' Both Tancosova, of Bradford and Mehmood, of Sheffield, admitted conspiring to facilitate the commission of a breach of immigration laws. Choudry Kanwal and Tancosova also admitted a second offence of making a false marriage statement. Ms Sarah Wright, prosecuting, said Kanwal, a Pakistani national, submitted an application to the Home Office for a certificate of approval on July 21, 2009 to allow him to marry Tancosova backed up by documentation. In May 2010, Tancosova and Kanwal completed their notice of marriage forms at Sheffield Register Office with Tancosova declaring she was free to marry when she had a gravely ill husband in Slovakia. The couple got married on June 17, 2010 with Mehmood acting as 'interpreter' and signing the register in a false name. While Tancosova had the right to remain in the UK as an EU citizen it emerged that Kanwal had entered the UK in 2007 on a six-month visitor’s visa and was here illegally. Prosecutor Ms Wright, said: 'This was a sham marriage arranged solely with the intention of allowing Kanwal to remain in the UK and was facilitated by Mehmood.' The judge at Sheffield Crown Court, pictured, told the defendants the wedding was a sham from start to finish . Kanwal submitted an application for a residency permit in July, 2010 but it was refused after Home Office officials became suspicious about the fake wedding and Tancosova was arrested at her Bradford home. She claimed the marriage was genuine and that she lived part of the time with Kanwal in Sheffield but could not supply an address. When arrested, Mehmood said he knew Kanwal from Pakistan and had backed his residency application but merely acted as an interpreter at the wedding. Kanwal later jumped bail in February 2011 and remains on the run. Defending Mehmood, a divorced father-of-four who has been granted leave to remain in the UK, Dermot Hughes said he had been well behaved since being released from a 15-month jail term for organising the other two sham marriages. But Judge Peter Kelson said he would have jailed Mehmood for at least two years if he had been sentencing him for all three fake marriages. 'You have got very lucky with a 15-month sentence, it should have been rather longer than that,' he was told by the judge. Mehmood received a community order with 200 hours of unpaid work. The judge told Tancosova: 'You knew from start to last that this was a sham marriage with the promise of money.'","Couple captured on CCTV handing their rings to a guest shortly after sham ceremony .

"By . Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 19:19 EST, 17 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:19 EST, 17 July 2012 . Jimmy Mubenga died from a heart attack in 2010 . Three security guards working for G4S were yesterday spared the threat of prosecution over the death of Angolan deportee Jimmy Mubenga. Lawyers at the Crown Prosecution Service said there was no evidence that could prove to a jury that the guards used illegal or deadly force. Mr Mubenga, who was being deported after serving a jail sentence for causing actual bodily harm, died of a cardiac arrest after the guards restrained him while putting him aboard an aircraft at Heathrow. The death of the father of five in . October 2010 provoked a wave of protest and G4S was stripped of the Home . Office contract to supervise removals of deportees shortly afterwards. Yesterday his widow Adrienne Makenda Kambana said the three guards had escaped the law. ‘We are distraught my husband has been taken away from me and my children have lost their father,’ she said. ‘He . was crying for help before he was killed. We can’t understand why the . officers and G4S are not answerable to the law and we or any other . member of the public would be.’ The Crown Prosecution Service considered four possible charges that could have been brought against the three guards over 46-year-old Mr Mubenga’s cardiorespiratory collapse. In all cases lawyers considered there was not enough evidence to prove their guilt to a jury. Senior Crown Advocate Gaon Hart said that in order to secure a conviction for gross negligence manslaughter a prosecution would have to prove that the victim was held bent over with his head either on or below his knees for enough time to show it was the actions of the security guards alone that had caused the death. The CPS said there was no evidence to prove to a jury that the three G4S guards used illegal or deadly force against Mr Mubenga . Mr Hart said that there were ‘conflicting witness accounts of the manner in which Mr Mubenga was restrained. ‘No witness had an unrestricted or uninterrupted view of what happened, and there is no clear picture of what happened in that key window of time to be able to convince a court that Mr Mubenga was held in the “severely splinted” position for a sufficient period of time.’ He said there had been a breach of duty by the guards, but the way Mr Mubenga was held was not severe enough for a prosecution. Mr Hart added: ‘It is not enough to tell a jury what may have caused a person’s death; I have to have sufficient evidence that there is a realistic prospect of proving it to them beyond reasonable doubt, and in these circumstances the evidence did not satisfy that test.’ He rejected charges of misconduct in public office or unlawful act manslaughter for similar reasons. Mubenga died of a heart attack after guards restrained him as he was put on a plane at Heathrow Airport in 2010 . G4S was found to have training methods that were flawed and suffered shortcomings, but the company had followed Whitehall-approved training methods and a jury would not consider the flaws amounted to corporate manslaughter. Instead Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer QC has ordered a rebuke to the company, in the form of a letter from Mr Hart which will ‘highlight concerns’. Mr Hart added that he understood the decision was not the one Mr Mubenga’s family hoped for, and he offered to meet them to explain it in person. The family’s solicitor Mark Scott said: ‘The evidence is that Mr Mubenga died after crying for help whilst under restraint. It is a surprise and shock that the DPP has not learned the lessons of earlier decisions and still sees fit to act as judge and jury rather than allowing the normal path of criminal justice to be followed.’","Jimmy Mubenga died after suffering heart attack in Heathrow in 2010 .

The sleepy worker was spotted slumped in a staff entrance of the plush Worsley Marriott Hotel in Salford - which will host football teams including Team GB. In the latest of a seemingly unending catalogue of embarrassments for G4S, the guard was swiftly hauled before bosses and sacked on the spot for the 'unacceptable' behaviour. Shambles: Police officers guard the Marriott Hotel, Worsley Park, in Greater Manchester, where only 17 of 56 G4S guards expected to work showed up for duty . His only saving grace, perhaps, was that the man bothered to show up for work at all, as it emerged this week that just 17 out of 56 guards expected to report for duty at the hotel actually appeared. Similarly, just four of the 58 staff expected to . report for duty at the Hilton Hotel in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, showed . up, one of whom later disappeared.

Five-year-old Boyd James, pictured with his dad Sam, has been left scarred for life after the horrifying incident . A five-year-old boy has been left scarred for life after an acidic drain cleaner leaked through his bedroom ceiling as he slept. Boyd James woke up in the early hours of the morning screaming that his face was ‘on fire’ after the powerful liquid dripped onto his bed. The occupant of the upstairs flat in Blandford, Dorset, had earlier poured the sulphuric acid-based cleaner down his kitchen sink in an attempt to unblock it. But the liquid was so strong that it melted the pipes, floor and ceiling before leaking onto Boyd. The acid in the cleaner, called 'One Shot Instant Drain Cleaner', melted his pillow and caused the five-year-old's skin to bubble and blister. Horrified mother Kayleigh, 24, splashed cold water over the youngster’s face in an attempt to relieve his pain. Mrs James spotted brown liquid seeping through the ceiling before calling the emergency services and her husband, Sam, who was at work at a butchers. The family evacuated the ground floor flat while firefighters arrived at the Georgian property and forced their way into the upstairs flat believing there to be a fire. But instead they found a gaping hole under the kitchen sink where the drain cleaner had burnt through. Paramedics spent two hours treating Boyd at the scene in Dorset. The five-year-old is expected to be left with chicken pox-like scarring to his face but has been told he was fortunate not to have been blinded or even killed. His mother said she first knew something was wrong when her son ran into the hall screaming that his face was burning. 'I thought he must have had a bad dream but I then saw his face was red, so I took his hands away and his lips were burning,' she said. 'It was bright red and blotching, blisters were breaking out and his skin was bubbling around the nose. 'Then I saw brown liquid all over his pyjamas so I ripped them off and started covering him with water in the bathroom. Boyd's pillow was almost completely melted after liquid from the powerful drain cleaning solution, also pictured, dripped down onto his bed . 'The children were both sleeping in Lyla’s room so while I was in the bathroom with Boyd I pulled Lyla towards the door, and then I saw the liquid pouring through the ceiling. 'It was melting (and) just burning through it. 'They managed to treat Sam in the ambulance and it’s a real miracle he didn’t need skin grafts. 'It’s horrible. You put your children to bed and think they will be safe. 'I can’t believe this product is on the market, if it gets into the wrong hands who knows what damage it could cause.' Fortunately, Boyd's two-year-old sister Lyla, who was sharing her room with Boyd at the time, was left unharmed following the incident. Boyd's father, Mr James, 28, said that paramedics had warned that his son was lucky to be alive: 'It was a frightening experience.' The male occupant of the upstairs flat is believed to have bought the cleaning fluid from a local hardware store. The label of the cleaning fluid states that it contains 91 percent sulphuric acid. A spokesman for the Hull-based company which manufactures the drain cleaner refused to comment today.","Boyd James woke up screaming that his face was 'on fire' after the powerful liquid dripped onto his bed from an upstairs flat .

An executive fighting a £300,000 battle to make insurers pay up for a fire that gutted his home has denied that his boyfriend started the blaze while having a 'hissy fit.' Jonathan Smyth returned home from work on the evening of Tuesday, January 22 2008, to find his house in Margaret Street, Brighton, ablaze with police and firefighters in attendance. The fire, which started in a basement bedroom, made the £350,000 house uninhabitable and caused huge damage to the contents - as well as killing three pet cats. Mr Smyth, who shared his four-storey three-bedroom house with two friends and his 41-year-old boyfriend Tony Howe - pet name ‘Tony Bear’ - subsequently made a claim for £200,000 against his policy with St Andrews Insurance Plc. Jonathan Smyth (left) shared his house with two friends and his boyfriend, Tony Howe, 41, (right) and denies his partner started the fire after a tantrum. Mr Smyth is fighting a £300,000 insurance battle . However the company refused to pay, denying liability for the damage, and asserting that Mr Howe had 'set the fire' when he was ‘intoxicated’ and having what his boyfriend described in court as 'a Tony Bear tantrum.' Mr Smyth, who works as an information security manager for Direct Line, is suing the insurers for more than £300,000 in the High Court, asking Judge John Randall QC to force them to meet his claim, plus interest and expenses. The court heard that while Mr Smyth, now of Cooperage Quay, Stirling, Scotland, was at work on the evening of the fire, Mr Howe and their flatmate, Rebecca Alexander, had an 'altercation' prior to the blaze being discovered. The court heard Mr Howe and the couple's flatmate Rebecca Alexander (pictured) had an 'altercation' before the blaze was discovered . The two flatmates had a 'history' of disagreements 'about tidiness' in the house, Sonia Nolten, for the insurance company, told the court. Mr Smyth had received a text from Miss Alexander as he made his way home from work, saying that Mr Howe had gone into a 'big fat Tony Tantrum' and that the pair had fallen out. The fire was discovered and the house evacuated whilst Miss Alexander, at the foot of whose bed the seat of the blaze was found, was out and she subsequently made 'accusations of arson' against Mr Howe. The fire brigade investigated and concluded that 'the most likely cause was a deliberate act.' Both Mr Howe and Miss Alexander were subsequently interviewed by the police in relation the fire, but neither was charged. However, on the basis of reports by the police and fire service, the insurance company, after its own inquiries, refused to pay out, explaining: 'It is the view of the insurer, based on the investigation, that Mr Howe set the fire because he was angry with Miss Alexander and intoxicated.' Mr Smyth, in the High Court witness box under cross-examination, admitted his boyfriend was 'rather prone to having hissy fits' but denied that he would have done anything to damage the house or harm any of its occupants. 'Tony had tantrums yes, hissy fits,' he said. 'I called them Tony Bear tantrums - it was like watching a five-year-old stamping and shouting,' he added. 'The tantrums varied. Sometimes it was just a moan, a complaint. On much rarer occasions it was a full stomp the feet and shout. Generally it was a hissy fit, not a full-on shouting match, a complaint, a bit of attention seeking,' he went on. 'What I call a Tony Bear tantrum covered a wide spectrum from the full blown row to a little ‘look at me’ attention seeking,' Mr Smyth added. Defending his boyfriend from the accusation that he would have set the fire in a 'rage', Mr Smyth said: 'Tony is soft - he wouldn’t lift a finger - it’s not in his nature.' Damage: The fire started in a basement bedroom of Mr Smyth's former home in Brighton and made it uninhabitable. Three pet cats were also killed in the blaze . Mr Howe, facing cross-examination himself, admitted that the descriptions of 'Tony Tantrums' were accurate. 'I do have other types of Tony Tantrum. I have lain on the floor in Marks & Spencer completely sober and made everybody laugh because I couldn’t get my own way about a bacon sandwich,' he told the judge. Mr Howe admitted that he had been drinking in pubs on the night of the blaze to celebrate his birthday and was 'merry' before returning home and rowing with Miss Alexander about 'the state of the kitchen'. He said that he yelled swearwords at Miss Alexander as she left the house and that the row had been 'on the bad end of the Tony Bear tantrum spectrum.' Miss Nolten, who is seeking to prove to the judge that Mr Howe probably set the fire, categorised this as 'extreme behaviour.' However, Mr Howe denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire. The hearing continues.","The fire started in a basement bedroom, made the house uninhabitable and killed three cats in January 2008 .

Thompson, who is accused of failing to pay his investors and crewmen linked to the discovery of the 'Ship of Gold' The ocean engineer credited with finding the mythic ‘Ship of Gold’ laden with treasure back in 1988 is now being sought by U.S. Marshalls for allegedly refusing to pay his crew and investors. The SS Central America sank during a hurricane off the North Carolina coast in 1857, taking 425 souls and up to 21 tons of gold to the ocean floor. The bullion had been shipped from San Francisco to the west coast of Panama, then sent by rail to the Central American nation's east coast and finally loaded onto the 280-foot steamship bound for New York. In 1983, Tommy G. Thompson, of Columbus, Ohio, organized an expedition to find the epic ship and recover the treasure, promising his investors major returns if his mission is a success. Five years later, on September 11, 1988, Thompson announced to much fanfare that his team, the Columbus-America Discovery Group, had found the shipwreck, but the big payday never came. Although books have been written about the search for the SS Central America, it remains unclear to this day how much gold was recovered from the underwater site, Fox News reported. It has been reported, however, that Thompson sold bars and coins to a California mint for $52million, but his investors, including a Columbus newspaper tycoon and a prominent auto dealer, say they have not seen a dime of it. Thompson’s crew made up of nine technicians who helped locate the ‘Ship of Gold’ and recover the treasure from the ocean floor 8,000 feet deep have been locked in a drawn-out legal battle to get more than $2million that they say their former boss still owes them. This engraving shows the sinking of the SS Central America, which sank in a storm of the coast of the Carolinas with the loss of 426 lives and £1.3million worth of gold cargo . ‘There is very little reason to doubt . that these plaintiffs will prevail and in an amount in excess of $2 . million,’ Michael Szolosi, an attorney for the technicians, told . FoxNews.com. ‘And all they see from the defendants is delay, delay, . delay.’ Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Edmund Sargus issued a warrant for 60-year-old Thompson, but so far, efforts by U.S. Marshalls to find him have proven fruitless. They have no current photo of him, and it seems that no one has laid an eye on him in years. One of Thompson’s attorneys said that his client is ‘at sea.’ Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Drew Shadwick told FoxNews.com that investigators are pursuing a ‘number of leads’ and hope to have Thompson in custody soon. Epic mission: Thompson began searching for the SS Central America in 1983 after reading witness accounts of the shipwreck . Judge Sargus temporarily blocked the . sale or transfer of 500 restrike gold coins made from some of the gold . discovered in the shipwreck. Those coins were included in part of a deal . in 2000 to sell rights to the remaining treasure to the California Gold . Marketing Group for $52million, leaving about $30million after the cost . of recovery efforts. Sargus also ordered Thompson to disclose the location of those coins, as well as funds from a trust. ‘We . have reason to believe that the 500 coins still exist somewhere and . that’s why it’s so important for [Thompson] to come to court as he’s . been ordered and to answer what the plaintiffs and the judge want . answered,’ the attorney for Thompson’s crewmen said. Bullion: These gold nuggets, bars and coins from the SS Central America lay on the ocean floor for over 140 years until their recovery in 1987 by U.S. firm Columbus-America Discovery Group . Court battles: Thompson's nine crew members sued the salvager, claiming that he failed to pay them more than $2million . According to Thompson’s own attorneys, the reclusive treasure hunter is not aware that there is a warrant out for his arrest. ‘It’s my understanding when he does . come back from sea he has every intention of complying with that court’s . order,’ attorney Avonte Campinha-Bacote said. ‘Obviously, he will . return.’ Thompson has been . mired in legal battles with a host of insurance companies, rival . treasure hunters and a group of 161 investors who put up $12.7million to . finance the expedition. 'Rich with historical appeal': The gold ingot which is set to go on sale at Bonhams in Los Angeles, California, next month . In . 1998, after years of litigation, Thompson and his companies were . rewarded 92 per cent of the recovered gold, with the rest going to . insurance companies that paid claims after the steamship sank, according . to the Columbus Dispatch. Eight . years later, the team of nine technicians filed a federal lawsuit to . seek the millions they claim is due to them for finding the most famous . shipwreck of its time. The . gold ship, a 278ft-long sidewheel steamer, had 578 passengers and crew . on board when she left the Panamanian port of Colon on September 3 1857, . bound for New York under the command of William Lewis Herndon. After . a stop in Havana, she continued north up the U.S. east coast until, on . September 9, she was caught in a Category 2 hurricane off the coast of . the Carolinas. After two . days rocked by the fierce tempest, the Central America's sails were . shredded, she was taking on water, and her boiler was on the verge of . being extinguished. Her fate . was sealed when one of the seals to the paddle wheels sprang a leak . and, by noon that day, her engineers could keep the boiler's fire . burning no longer. The resulting fall in steam pressure . shut down both the pumps that were keeping water at bay and the paddle . wheels that had kept her bow to the wind. In . an attempt to draw attention to their plight, passengers and crew flew . the ship's flag upside down, a universal sign of distress, to try to . signal a passing ship. None came. A bucket brigade was formed and her passengers and crew spent the night fighting a losing battle against the rising water. As the ship passed the eye of the storm, engineers made vain attempts to relight the boiler. The second half of the storm then . struck. Without power the Central America was carried along with the . hurricane, unable to escape the powerful winds. The . next morning two ships were spotted and 153 passengers, mainly women . and children, managed to make their way over in lifeboats. However . the intense winds and heavy seas pulled the Central America and the . rest of her company away from any hope of rescue. By 8pm that night, the . ship sank with them - and her precious cargo - still aboard. Earlier this month, a gold bar recovered from the steamship was put on the auction block with an . estimate set at 211 times it's original value. Stamped on the 40-ounce Ingot is the bar’s original value of $743.70 along with ‘Kellog and Humbert’. The reverse is a plain casting save for the serial number 648 repeated at the top. The SS Central America was recovered by Ohio-based treasure hunters Columbus America Discovery Group using a remote-controlled submarine in 1987.The group, led by Tommy Thompson, located the wreck using Bayesian search theory, where a number of factors are taken into account direct the search for lost objects.Significant amounts of gold and other artifacts were then recovered and brought to the surface using another remote-controlled sub built specifically for the recovery.After the Mr Thompson announced the find, 39 insurance companies filed a suit claiming they had a right to the gold, on the grounds that they had paid out the damages for its loss in the 19th Century.The team that found it argued in court that the gold had been abandoned and, after a legal battle, they were awarded 92 per cent of the treasure trove in 1996.The total value of the recovered gold was estimated at $150million. One recovered ingot weighing 80lb sold for a record $8million and was recognized as the most valuable piece of currency in the world at that time.","Tommy Thompson found the SS Central America in 1988 .

"By . James Tozer . UPDATED: . 19:53 EST, 14 February 2012 . A married doctor who was secretly recorded enjoying sex sessions with a woman patient was struck off yesterday. GP Simon Robinson, 44, was told he had 'exploited' Jill Tudor for his own 'sexual gratification' by conducting a 16-month affair with her. His career was left in tatters after he was found to have shown a 'reckless disregard' for the principles of good medical practice by a disciplinary panel. Struck off: Dr Simon Robinson, from Oswestry, Shropshire, who was secretly recorded having sex sessions with a patient was removed from the register yesterday. He is pictured arriving at the GMC hearing with his wife Catherine . Last night his 50-year-old victim said the outcome had made the ordeal of having tapes of their encounters played in public worthwhile. 'This is the right outcome,' she told the Daily Mail. 'People like him are in a position of power and think they can get away with exploiting others, but my case proves they can be found out. 'Other women need to know that GPs aren't always the wonderful, trusting people that we think they are.' Relationship: The GP had a 16-month fling with Jill Tudor . Dr Robinson, a father-of-two, regularly engaged in sex sessions with five-times married Miss Tudor during 'triple and quadruple appointments' at his surgery in Oswestry, Shropshire and at her home. He would call her his 'Number One patient' in greetings cards and even encouraged her to fabricate symptoms so he could be sent round to see her out-of-hours. But the mother-of-four began to feel 'used' and in December 2010 used her mobile phone to make two lengthy tape recordings of what were supposed to be check-ups, but instead saw her perform sex acts upon him. On one, he is heard to say 'Ah come here' followed by the sound of kissing and heavy breathing, while on the second, after a period without dialogue, Miss Tudor says 'I really enjoyed it' to which he responds 'I did as well'. Yesterday the General Medical Council's disciplinary panel ruled that only striking Dr Robinson off the medical register would maintain public confidence in the profession. Referring to Miss Tudor as 'Patient A', panel chairman Professor Denis McDevitt told the GP he hadn't shown remorse or insight into his behaviour. Practice: GP Simon Robinson regularly engaged in sex sessions with five-times married Miss Tudor during 'triple and quadruple appointments' at his surgery in Oswestry, Shropshire . 'On the contrary, you have denied the allegation throughout, requiring Patient A to give evidence and to have the recordings of your misconduct with her to be played at the public hearing,' he added. 'Although full sexual intercourse did not take place, the panel regards the sexual acts which did take place between you and Patient A as having the same gravity as full sexual intercourse. 'Your interest in the relationship seems to have been essentially sexual gratification and the panel is of the view that the relationship was unequal and exploitative.' It also found he had shown 'a reckless disregard for the principles in ""Good Medical Practice""' as well as displaying dishonesty in arranging bogus appointments and falsifying Miss Tudor's medical records so they could meet up for sex. He concluded: 'The panel accepts that you are a very capable GP who is highly respected throughout your local community. 'But in view of the combination of very serious sexual misconduct and dishonesty, it has determined that a period of suspension would not be sufficient to maintain public confidence in the medical profession, nor to declare and uphold proper standards of conduct and behaviour.' Instead, it ruled that he should be struck off with immediate effect. The hearing in Manchester earlier rejected Dr Robinson's claims the two tapes had been tampered with after hearing analysis by a forensics expert. He also had to undress and show the panel members his naked torso after Miss Tudor described three moles - two of which tallied with her account.","Simon Robinson, 44, had sex with five-times married patient during triple and quadruple appointments .

Most typical five-month-old babies can't crawl, let alone drive, but an experimental buggy has given some lucky children the chance to steer their own robot. Designed by researchers at Ithaca College in New York to assist babies with disabilities, the WeeBot encourages children to move around independently using the pint sized scooter. Built from a motorised base, a booster seat and a Nintendo Wii balance board, the WeeBot was developed to stimulate the cognitive functions of children suffering from conditions such as cerebral palsy or Down syndrome. Scroll Down for Video . The baby at Ithaca College in New York takes the WeeBot through its paces . Intended for children who are unable . to crawl because they suffer from a mental impairment, the WeeBot is . supposed to grant independent mobility to infants and kick start their . development. 'In . typically developing infants, the initiation of independent locomotion . heralds concomitant development in aspects of communicative, emotional, . perceptual, cognitive and social behaviour,' states a study produced by . the research team at Ithaca College. 'Typically . developing children whose mobility has been restricted for even . relatively short periods of time have been found to demonstrate . apathetic behaviour and depressed motivation,' states the study. At . the moment though, the robots encourage children with disabilities to . move around independently, at exactly the same time that other . five-month-old infants have learned to crawl. However, one of the scientists in the research team which created the WeeBot has said that the device is in fact only a developmental aid for children and parents should always encourage their child to walk. 'For children who are typically developing we would encourage parents to support their child's 'natural' development, because at each stage of motor development, children develop strength and skills that help them master the next developmental steps,' said Carole Dennis Associate Professor, Occupational Therapy at Ithaca College . 'That said, we don't think that robot experience in and of itself would stunt development (unless children weren't provided sufficient experiences for typical movement development). 'My colleagues (Sharon Stansfield and Hélène Larin) and I think that it might actually increase the motivation of children to move. One child leans to the left to grabs a paper bag they find interesting while another child is offered a firurative 'carrot' to move towards the researcher . It is movement which some childhood specialists believes encourages mental development, as children seek out new environments for their brain to make sense of. 'We think that babies with disabilities are missing an opportunity for learning that typically developing babies have,' said Carole Dennis to Yahoo. Previously, researchers had focused on providing babies with joysticks, however, the WeeBot relies on the baby simply leaning in the direction that it wants to travel. 'What I think is exciting is that we're pushing the age envelope much and much younger,' said Maria Jones, a professor of physical therapy at the University of Oklahoma who was not part of the WeeBot research. The research team at Ithaca were driven on by findings of past research which indicate that developing children undergo dramatic mental changes when they start to move by themselves. However, some children with disabilities do not begin to learn to explore their environment until they are three-years-old. The WeeBot built by Ithaca College to enable disabled children to experience movement and learning and therefore increase their development . 'We know the brain is aching for exploration,' said Cole Galloway, a physical therapist at the Univeristy of Delaware who is an expert in robot maneuverability devices for infants. 'It we treated a typically developing kid the way we treat these kids, it would be as it we put these kids in a closet of cage until they can take adult commands,' said Galloway. To create the WeeBot, Dennis teamed up with physical therapist Héléne Larin and computer programmer Sharon Stansfield. The Wii board part registers shifts in weight to the left  or right or forwards or backwards depending on how the child leans. A child is encouraged to lean forward thereby making the WeeBot move forward as trials for the Nintendo Wii board equipped device continued . The Ithaca team added sonar-style instruments to the front and back of the WeeBot to halt the children running into obstacles. The team discovered after a little training, 90 percent of able bodied infants could successfully control the device. And then children with disabilities were given trial runs to see they would react. One, a seven-month-old boy with Down syndrome only used the WeeBot satisfactorily nine-percent of the time, while a 15-month old with cerebral palsy became 85-percent proficient in use of the device. The Segway was the first self-balancing electric powered transportation machine and was introduced in 2002 . Researchers believe that the WeeBot needs more trialing before they can think about a cost-effective manufacture, especially in its safety features. However, the researchers believe that the WeeBot genuinely aids in the development of mentally disabled children and will push to see them put into production. 'Some parents of typically-developing infants that we have worked with have mentioned that their children seem to be a bit frustrated when they aren't in the WeeBot, because they can't move,' said Carole Dennis. 'So the realization that there is a great world out there to explore might increase children's desire to get moving!'",Developed for children who suffer a mental disability the WeeBot is supposed to grant independent mobility to infants and kick start their development .

Olive Wilson, 79, took over the Royal Oak in Ockbrook, near Derby in 1952. Over the years her reputation has grown and in 2003, to celebrate her 50 years as publican, brewers Coors created OWB – Olive Wilson’s Brew. Legend: Britain's longest serving landlady Olive Wilson has spent 60 years behind the bar, and still has no plans to stop pulling pints anytime soon . When she began her career she had no experience behind the bar and said it was unusual for women to work, let alone be landlady. The grandmother-of-four was reluctant and thought she would only spend a few years at the pub with her husband Lewis before they moved on. 'The customers were all men and I did my ironing behind the bar if it was quiet,' said Mrs Wilson told The Mirror. She said that on Saturday evenings men would play darts and women would bring their knitting to the pub. To get punters in she hired a television knowing few people in the village would be able to watch the Coronation.

But she was shocked when people brought in their own . sandwiches and flasks of tea. She explained that when she started out the prices were very different to now. 'It cost 11 old pence for a pint of mild and a shilling (5p) for a pint of bitter.' Mrs Wilson said the range of alcohol was limited and it was only cask ales that were sold along with port and sherry. Licensing hours were 11am to 3pm and 5pm to 10.30pm. The couple eventually bought the pub with Lewis's retirement money, but Mrs Wilson's name is still above the door as it was when the couple began working at the pub - her husband worked on the railway during the day. Since his death in 1994, she . now runs the pub with daughters Jean Hornbuckle and Sally Parrott, but . said she that they still do not stock modern drinks such as alcopops. Her reputation has preceded her and Mrs Wilson has won many accolades including CAMRA’s rural pub of the year twice. In 2000, Cottage Brewery in Somerset named its Olive’s Oil ale after her. Over the years Mrs Wilson has . witnessed many changes and cites the 2007 smoking ban as a positive move . saying she hated the smoke.

Failure: A report for Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams claims clergy failed to protect children from paedophile priests' abuse . A Church of England report yesterday accused clergy in an ancient diocese of a ‘disastrous’ failure to protect children from abuse by paedophile priests. The investigation carried out for the Archbishop of Canterbury said that many lives had been blighted, and a string of court cases was just the tip of the iceberg of corruption in the Diocese of Chichester. It followed deepening concerns after one vicar was jailed for five years for sexually abusing two boys and another parish priest died without being charged with any offence after abusing at least ten boys. Three retired priests in the diocese are facing charges of sexual offences against children. The interim report comes more than a year after an initial inquiry by retired judge Baroness Butler-Sloss and has itself taken eight months to produce. Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams apologised to victims. ‘The abiding hurt and damage done to them is something that none of us in the Church can ignore,’ he said. ‘We owe them not only our words of apology but our best efforts to make sure that in the future our churches will be safe. ‘The interim report confirms there have been many and longstanding failures in implementing a robust and credible safeguarding policy in the Diocese of Chichester.’ The report by retired Bishop of Chelmsford the Right Reverend John Gladwin said: ‘It is clear to us that many lives have been blighted. Concerned: A vicar was jailed for five years for sexually abusing two boys and a parish priest died without being charged with any offence after abusing at least 10 boys . ‘Some have sought justice through the courts of law. Clergy have gone to prison for their abuse of children. 'We are clear that those who have sought justice through the courts are but the tip of the iceberg.’ 'Many lives blighted': The report by Right Reverend John Gladwin shows justice through the courts is 'just the tip of the iceberg' The damage was made worse by the slow progress of inquiries, it said. The two priests known to have abused . children were the Reverend Colin Pritchard, vicar of St Barnabas in . Bexhill-on-Sea until 2007, who was subsequently jailed for abusing two . boys. Pritchard was allowed to continue running his parish for ten years after he was first reported to police for sex offences. The Reverend Roy Cotton, a parish . priest in Brede, near Rye, died in September 2006 after prosecutors had . decided there was too little evidence to charge him. Three retired priests from the . diocese have been charged with sexual offences this year. They were . named by the BBC as Canon Gordon Rideout, 73, of Wannock, East Sussex; . the Reverend Robert Coles, 71, of Eastbourne; and Father Wilkie Denford, . 77, of Shoreham, West Sussex. The first two face multiple charges . dating from the 1960s to 1984. The last has denied four charges of . indecently assaulting a boy under 16 in the late 1980s.

A former soap star who admitted driving the getaway car in a gangland shooting has been jailed for perverting the course of justice. Brian Regan, 53, who played Terry . Sullivan in Channel 4's Brookside, was found not guilty at Liverpool . Crown Court over his role in the killing of nightclub doorman Bahman . Faraji, 44. However, he was convicted of two counts of perverting the course of justice by lying to police in the early stages of the murder investigation and disposing of a pair of gloves he wore on the night. Jailed: Former Brookside actor Brian Regan, left, was cleared of murdering a nightclub doorman but was jailed for perverting the course of justice. He is pictured right as his Brookside character Terry Sullivan . Regan, who was on bail for supplying cocaine when the murder took place, was jailed on January 25 for a total of four years and 10 months. The facts can now be revealed after Mrs Justice Nicola Davies lifted reporting restrictions put in place to avoid prejudicing the trial of another defendant, Jason Gabbana, who was today convicted of the murder. Bahman Faraji, known by the nicknames Batman and Ben, was gunned down in a 'ruthlessly planned and callously carried out execution'. Prosecutors said it was the result of an argument between criminals. Those involved in the shooting went to extraordinary lengths to lure Mr Faraji, 44, to his death on February 24 last year. He had gone to the Belgrave public house that night following a series of phone calls he received from a pay-as-you-go mobile phone. Victim: Nightclub doorman Bahman Faraji was shot in the face . 'This was a dirty phone obtained for the purpose of luring Mr Faraji to his death and used in a disciplined way that was designed to leave no clue as to the identity of its user,' prosecutor Brian Cummings QC had told the jury. Regan's unwitting involvement began when he delivered a £30 bag of cocaine to drug user Edward Heffey. The former soap star told the trial he would supply Heffey, a convicted armed robber, with drugs 'about three or four times a day'. That night, '(Heffey) asked for a lift to go and get money so he could pay for the drugs', Regan said. The pair then drove to Belgrave Road, around the corner from the pub, and Heffey left the vehicle as Regan snorted a line of cocaine. Mr Faraji arrived at the Belgrave in the company of two other men shortly after 6.30pm on the night of his murder. They spent about 10 minutes in the pub before they went outside and stood on the pavement. A short while later the gunman approached and said to Mr Faraji, 'Are you Ben?'. Mr Faraji nodded and the killer raised his shotgun and fired it directly into the victim's face from a distance of three or four feet. Mr Faraji fell to the ground in a cloud of smoke and died instantly as Heffey ran back to the waiting car. Detective Chief Inspector Neil Bickley of Merseyside Police's major incident team said it was a 'shocking' crime. He added: 'Any murder is an appalling event but to me this was striking - it was 6.50pm in a quiet residential area outside a pub during half-time in a Liverpool match. 'What became apparent during the investigation and from the evidence in the trial is that Mr Faraji had received a telephone call in the evening requesting him to go to the pub for a meeting. 'That call was from a dirty phone which was used to deliberately lure him to the pub to be shot.' Mr Bickley added: 'The defendants have never volunteered any information to suggest what the motive was. Actor: Brian Regan can be seen performing in a play called '30 Days in Walton Jail' back in 2008 . Brutal: The murder occurred outside the Belgrave pub in Aigburth, Liverpool, pictured, which is in a quiet residential area . 'It would seem likely to me that Mr Faraji thought he was going to meet somebody he knew. 'It's entirely possible that was for some sort of illicit meeting but we really don't know at this stage.' Following the shooting, detectives launched a murder investigation and began by hunting for the getaway car, a red Ford Escort estate, which had been spotted by witnesses and on CCTV. The next day, police stop-checked the vehicle in Liverpool city centre and at the wheel was Regan alongside girlfriend Christine Line. Regan initially told police he had not been anywhere near the area where the murder took place. But Line's witness statement contained significant differences and detectives became suspicious. Caught: Brian Regan drove Edward Heffey, left, to the pub on the night of the murder. Jason Gabbana, right, has been convicted of the murder . The couple were arrested that night and Regan's efforts to distance himself from the shooting quickly unravelled. Mr Bickley said: 'The last thing the police need at the start of an investigation is somebody trying to wrong foot them. 'That's clearly what Regan's statements were intended to do. 'Fortunately, we were not wrong footed for too long but it is completely unacceptable to mislead the police at any time and certainly at the start of a murder investigation when time is so critical for us.' The jury was told that on the way to the police station, Regan said: 'I done nothing wrong and I didn't do anything willingly.' He also told detectives: 'I want to help you but I'll be shot.' After giving evidence against his co-accused, the court ordered security be stepped up around Regan and that security guards sit between him and the rest of the defendants. He was also designated a 'vulnerable prisoner' and placed in the isolation wing of his jail. Popular: TV show Brookside - which Brian Regan starred in - was set in this residential close in Liverpool . Prisoner: Regan was found not guilty at Liverpool Crown Court, pictured, over his role in the killing of Faraji but he was jailed for perverting the course of justice . Mr Bickley said the murder had left a 'devastating' mark on Mr Faraji's family. 'There is a six-year-old son who is going to grow up without knowing his dad and that is appalling,' the detective added. 'It is going to take an awful long time for them to come to terms with what's happened.' Paul Whittaker, the chief crown prosecutor for Merseyside, said: 'This was a ruthlessly planned and callously carried out execution of a 44-year-old man in a quiet residential street in a suburban part of Liverpool. 'The whole circumstances of the offence are quite shocking. 'The police and the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) will not spare any effort to investigate, prepare and pursue these cases and together we are absolutely committed to driving all organised crime and gun crime out of Merseyside.'","53-year-old played Terry .

Just 48 hours after being crowned Paralympic champion in the 5,000m, the 33 year-old lit up the Olympic Stadium by propelling his custom-built £3,000 carbon fibre racing wheelchair to victory. His win capped another impressive day for Great Britain at the Paralympics, which included a gold medal for archer Danielle Brown. Brown, who refuses to take painkillers for an excruciating neurological condition said to be as painful as terminal cancer, defeated fellow Briton Mel Clarke in a tense final.

One of the 'faces of London 2012', Weir, . who has 'winner' tattooed on his arm in Japanese, punched the air with . delight as he went on a triumphant lap of honour a flag draped around . his shoulders. 'It's just an amazing feeling as it is the blue riband event,' Weir said. 'Every wheelchair racer wants to win the 1500m. 'I've done it twice now, so it's a great honour. I always dreamt of winning them and I've done it twice.' A father of two, from Sutton, South London, Weir was born without the use of his legs. He . first competed in the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 as a teenager, but . abandoned sport soon afterwards after being disillusioned by the empty . stadiums at that games. But . he returned in 2004 after being inspired by watching Tanni-Grey . Thompson at the Sydney Olympics and went on to win golds in Beijing. He has been unable to use his legs after difficulties at birth and suffered a spine injury that left him walking with calipers.

It was the perfect follow-up to Weir's success in the T54 5,000m race, which he won on Sunday night. And it ensured he emulated his performance in Beijing four years ago, when he won Britain's only two gold medals on the track. He could yet add to his tally at these Games, as he is due to compete in the 800m and marathon.

Triumphant: Law graduate Danielle Brown collects her gold medal after defeating Mel Clarke in a tense all-British archery final . She is the tough woman of archery who refuses to take painkillers for her condition and hates ‘sob stories’. And yesterday, Paralympian Danielle Brown lived up to her reputation when she held her nerve to clinch a gold medal. She defeated Mel Clarke in a tense all-British final at The Royal Artillery Barracks in front of 3,500 screaming spectators. Law graduate Brown, 24, has reflex sympathetic dystrophy, a neurological condition that causes excruciating pain in her legs and feet, and which leaves her too weak to walk long distances. She says: ‘On the pain scale, they say it is on the same level as terminal cancer’. But perched upon a bicycle seat attached to a tripod, she gritted her  teeth and won the women’s individual compound by six sets to four. Brown, who has a tattoo of the Paralympic Agitos symbol on her wrist, said she was ‘chuffed to bits’ to win at a home Games. The world number one, from Bingley, West Yorkshire, is known by the pink floppy hat she has worn at every major competition for the past five years. Last night, she said it was ‘crazy’ that her face would now be printed on a stamp, as will happen for all Britain’s gold medal winners at London 2012, adding: ‘I hope they have got a nice photo. I look a bit dodgy with hat hair at the moment.’ She refuses to take pain relief medication because it makes her feel ‘dizzy and sick’, but said: ‘Competing helps because when I’m focusing on shooting, and with the massive adrenaline rush that comes, I’m not focusing on the pain that I’m in.’ Coincidentally, her rival Clarke suffers from the same malfunction of the nervous system, after contracting a bone infection as a child. Winner: Danielle Brown, who has reflex sympathetic dystrophy, was watched by 3,500 spectators at The Royal Artillery Barracks . On the podium: Danielle Brown (right) poses for pictures with fellow Briton Mel Clarke (left), whom she defeated in the gold medal match. Clarke had to settle for silver . But nine years ago, Clarke was also . paralysed from the waist down and lost the sight in her shooting eye . after contracting Lyme’s disease from an insect bite. The . Norwich-born shooter, who celebrated her 30th birthday on Sunday, said . yesterday: ‘I feel incredible. Danielle shot really well. We train hard . together and we are friends, but at the end of the day, it’s a . competition and good on her for winning gold.’ Brown, who shoots arrows at up to 200mph, has not lost at a major championship in five years. Remarkably, . she also competes in able-bodied competitions and at the Commonwealth . Games in Delhi in 2010, where she won a gold medal, she became the first . Paralympian to shoot for England in a non-disabled discipline. When she was 11, she began to get searing pain in her limbs, reducing her to floods of tears daily. In the pink: Danielle Brown lets fly during the archery competition at The Royal Artillery Barracks . Over the next five years her condition deteriorated, but doctors could not find the cause and accused her of ‘attention-seeking’. She was unable to play conventional sports, but her father bought her archery lessons for her 15th birthday and she loved it. She initially struggled with the word ‘disabled’ and avoided using her wheelchair at all costs as she saw it as ‘kind of like giving up’. She said: ‘It wasn’t until I went to the Paralympics, and saw so many inspirational people and what they were achieving with their own problems that I put it into perspective.’ Brown has a first in law but said she has no intention of pursuing a legal career to ‘sit behind a desk all day’. She is in a long-term relationship with Paralympic powerlifter Ali Jawad, 23, who was born with no legs and moved to Britain from Lebanon as a child, as his parents wanted a better life for him. Eight years ago, Heather Frederiksen (above) was told she would never swim again following a life-changing accident that left her with limited use of her right arm and leg. But the 26-year-old, from  Leigh in Lancashire, yesterday powered her way to a gold medal,  successfully defending her S8 100m backstroke title. It was her second medal of London 2012 after a silver in the 400m freestyle last week and she could hardly believe her success. ‘Did it really happen?’ she asked  just moments after getting out of  the pool. ‘This means more than anyone will ever know – I’m so happy. ‘It’s unreal. Beijing was fantastic, it was my first Paralympic Games,  but this means so much. ‘To come here in front of my home crowd with everyone willing me along was absolutely fantastic.’ But her fellow British swimmer Ellie Simmonds (right) missed out on a chance of a third London gold after finishing third last night in the 50m freestyle, her weakest event. The 17-year-old, who has dwarfism, has only one more chance of gold but she was far from dejected, declaring: ‘I’m really chuffed to get a bronze medal, I can’t believe it – it’s just going so well for me.’","Weir, 33, of Sutton, South London, won 1,500m final in time of 3:12.09 .

At first glance, it might look like just a . piece of leftover holiday loose change, but it is actually worth millions - . making it possibly the most valuable ounce of gold in the world. The rare 1933 $20 Double Eagle is the most . expensive gold coin ever to be sold at auction and a legend among collectors. Now, for the first time, a Double Eagle - . one of which sold for $7.6million (£4.8million) at Sotheby's in 2002 - will be exhibited in the . UK. Nearly half a million of the gold coins were minted in the U.S. in 1933 in the midst of the Great Depression but only 13 . are known to exist today. For the first time, a rare 1933 $20 Double Eagle will be exhibited in the UK . Nearly half a million of the gold coins were minted in the U.S. in 1933 in the midst of the Great Depression but only 13 are known to exist today . The rest of the coins, featuring an eagle . on one side and Liberty on the other, were melted down before they ever left . the United States Mint, sacrificed as part of a strategy to remove America from the gold standard and stabilise the American economy. Only one coin is legally in private hands, . with all other 1933 Double Eagles remaining as property of the U.S. government, . and the U.S. secret service pursues any newly discovered coins. The coin which will go on display in . London next month is one of two 1933 Double Eagles saved by the U.S. Mint and . given to the Smithsonian Institution in 1933 as a matter of record. The . 1933 'Double Eagle' was dreamed up by President Roosevelt’s distant . cousin,Theodore, who had commissioned the sculptor Augustus . Saint-Gaudens to re-design the $20 gold coin in the early 1900s. Teddy Roosevelt wanted an American coin that matched the beauty of the ancient Greek ones. The last run of nearly 500,000 coins were never released, and it was thought they were all melted down for scrap. In industry speak, an 'eagle' is $10, hence the term 'double eagle' for the $20 1933 examples. The exhibition is part of a European tour . arranged by the Samlerhuset Group, parent company of the London Mint Office, . with the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, based in Washington . DC. It is the first time that the Smithsonian . has sent an object from its numismatic collection on tour in Europe. Peter Swanston, chief executive of the . London Mint Office, said: 'This is an incredibly exciting event. As well as . being immensely valuable, the 1933 Double Eagle is a truly beautiful coin. 'We are thrilled to bring it to London and . I'm sure many people will want to come and see this icon of American history.' Marc Pachter, interim director of the . National Museum of American History, said: 'The 1933 Double Eagle is a symbol . of a shared struggle in an interdependent global economy, both in the early . 20th century and today. 'We are delighted to make one of the . greatest treasures of the Smithsonian available to European audiences as part . of this unprecedented tour.' The free exhibition will be open to the . public at Goldsmiths' Hall in Foster Lane, London, between 10am and 4pm on . Saturday, March 3 and Sunday, March 4. Originator: Franklin Roosevelt took the coins out of circulation in a bid to shore up the ailing U.S. banking system . Pursued by Secret Service agents for over 60 years... and then 10 Double Eagles turn up in Philadelphia . The . mysterious $20 Double Eagles have been pursued for over 60 years by Secret Service agents . determined to take them out of circulation. The intrigue surrounding them was reignited last August following a lengthy court battle when ten of the ultra-rare coins were found in a  Philadelphia family jewellers. Double Eagles were first minted in 1850 with a face value of $20. But the . 445,500 coins minted in 1933 were never put into circulation because newly inaugurated . President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued an order prohibiting the . release of gold from the Mint. Collector: King Farouk of Egypt (1920-1965) acquired one of the coins which was subsequently sold after his deposition . The move was a desperate measure to rescue the . banking system, which was in danger of collapsing as people withdrew gold as quickly as they could. All the coins were ordered melted . down in 1937, but a handful are believed to have survived, including the two handed . over to the Smithsonian Institution. In . 2003, Joan Langbord, the daughter of a Philadelphia jeweller, said she . found the ten coins in her father's bank deposit bank after he died. She said that her father could have acquired them legally, perhaps through a trade of gold scrap. Langbord and . her son, Roy, notified the Mint of the discovery and asked . officials asked to authenticate the coins. The mint confirmed they were genuine, then confiscated the coins. Speaking at the time David Lebryk, acting director of the Mint, had announced in a news . release that the rare coins, which were never put in circulation, had . been taken from the Mint 'in an unlawful manner' in the mid-1930s and . now were 'recovered.' The coins, which are so rare that their value is almost beyond calculation, are public property, he said. After . a lengthy legal battle, last month a jury finally decided the coins . belonged to government and would not be returned to the family. Speaking to MSNBC, Robert W. Hoge, . curator of North American coins and currency at the American Numismatic . Society said: 'The government has been fanatical about seizing and . destroying these coins. 'They’re famous because the government has been seizing them since the 1940s.' Jay Brahin, an investment adviser who has been collecting coins since he was a boy in Philadelphia, added: 'The 1933 Double Eagle is one of the most intriguing coins of all time. Mystery: Israel Switt, seen here in 1944, is believed to have illicitly obtained some of the coins, according to mint officials . 'It’s a freak. The coins shouldn’t have been minted, but they were. 'They weren’t meant to circulate, but . some did. And why has the government pursued them so arduously? That’s . one of the mysteries.' In 2002, Sotheby's and numismatic firm Stack's auctioned off a 1933 . Double Eagle coin for $7.6million, the highest price ever paid for a . coin. That Double Eagle, which is believed to have been part of a . collection belonging to King Farouk of Egypt, surfaced when a coin . dealer tried selling it to undercover Secret Service agents. After a legal battle, the dealer was permitted to sell the coin at . auction on the condition he split the proceeds with the Mint. The . Mint contends Israel Switt obtained a cache of the gold coins from his . connections at the Mint just before they were to be reduced to bullion . in 1937. Switt . admitted in 1944 that he had sold nine Double Eagle coins, but he was . not charged in connection with those transactions, according to the . Mint.","Only 13 of the $20 coins are known to exist today .

Greece faces months of political uncertainty after no one won an overall majority with the prospect of the Greeks being forced to pull out of the eurozone still looming on the horizon.

An end to austerity: Mr Hollande kisses his companion Valerie Trierweiler after he swept to victory last night - and became the first Socialist president for 17 years . 'You are a movement lifting up everywhere in Europe, and perhaps the world.' Mr Hollande wants a new ‘preamble’ written into the European fiscal pact signed by 25 EU nations last year to water down calls for austerity measures. He is demanding a change to strict rules which dictate how much member states can spend, without which most observers believe a new European economic crisis is inevitable. He has also pledged to slap a 75 per cent tax on those earning more than one million euros a year, or around £850,000. The move is expected to lead to an exodus of 'le super rich' - with many of them likely to head to London where the top rate of tax will be 45p.

In court: Air stewardess Stephanie Partington at Solihull Magistrates after being found under the influence of alcohol at work . As an air stewardess, Stephanie Partington's duties included calming down noisy and over-refreshed passengers. But on one particular flight back to Britain it was her own drunken behaviour which caused the problem. The 24-year-old was so loud as she served passengers at the back of the 300-seat Boeing 777 that the purser had to ask her to 'quieten down'. Suspicions were raised further when routine paperwork she filled out at the end of the seven-hour flight from Dubai to Birmingham was illegible. The captain of the Emirates flight radioed ahead for police who met the plane when it landed. Partington, from Liverpool, who insisted she had not been drinking during the flight, was arrested when she failed a  breath test. Further procedures revealed she had 164mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood – twice the drink-drive limit of 80mg and eight times the legal limit of 20mg for flight attendants under aviation law. Charged under the Civil Aviation Act, Partington admitted allowing her capacity to act to be impaired through drink and was fined £110, with £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Prosecutor Fiona Davis told Solihull magistrates: 'She was working at the back of the plane and during the flight the purser became aware she was very loud and had to ask to quieten her down. 'At the end of the flight she was required to fill in paperwork and the purser noticed her handwriting was very bad and what she wrote was illegible. The purser was concerned about her behaviour.' She added the captain believed Partington – whose Facebook page shows her partying with a glass of champagne – was drunk and asked for police officers to attend.

Miss Cullen said Partington disputed the purser's claim that she had not performed her duties professionally.

A devout Christian who driven by jealousy threw boiling water over the love rival she believed bedded her boyfriend has been jailed for five years. Edith Wiredu, 21, from Canterbury, told Terena Omoetuk, 20, they needed to 'talk' amid rumours the design student was sleeping with the lover from whom she had just split - but still cared for. Canterbury Crown Court heard that when Terena denied the allegations church-going mother-of-one Wiredu, also a student, hurled the scalding water over her. Terena was rushed to hospital with burns to a quarter of her body and has been left with scars across her chest and neck. Jailing Wiredu, Judge Edward Connell said: 'This was a wicked and nasty offence and you should count it very lucky the injuries weren’t more serious. 'This was a wholly deliberate act committed in anger and designed to injure your victim. 'This is a particularly tragic case because you have made remarkable progress in your education. However, a probation report on Wiredu, claimed she had shown no remorse for the attack in November last year. The incident happened after Wiredu confronted her friend about allegations that she had been cheating with her boyfriend. She then walked into the kitchen area of their house, picked up a bowl of boiling water and threw it over her. Miss Umoetuk told how she and fellow students had met and had been planning to attend a meeting of the university's Afro-Caribbean Society. Instead, Wiredu quizzed her friend about having sex with her boyfriend Tinashe. Edith Wiredu was sentenced to five years at Canterbury Crown Court . Ms Umoetuk told the jury: 'I said: 'No'. I was shocked and confused. She asked me again and I denied it again. 'She then started getting angry and said that I had to start telling her the truth because he had told her. But I denied it again. 'She then left and went into the living room. I followed her and as I walked in, Edith appeared with a bowl of hot liquid and threw it over me. It went over my face and chest.' She then claimed that as she fell to the floor, Wiredu grabbed her hair and tried to stamp on her head. Wiredu, who was studying tourism, and has a three-year-old child, denied inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. But she was convicted unanimously by a jury. Philip Rowley, defending, said: 'Clearly Miss Wiredu did not articulate correctly her feelings to the probation officer and she was surprised to read that she viewed herself as a victim, too. 'She wants it said that she does not view herself in that role and accepts the victim suffered deeply unpleasant injuries which will last a long time. She accepts her responsibility.'","Graphic design student left with burns covering a quarter of her body after attack .

The disabled mother of the youngest British soldier killed in Afghanistan has told of her heartbreak after being forced to betray her son’s dying wish. Lucy Aldridge, 44, knew her son William wanted his £218,000 life insurance and death benefit package to pass to his younger brothers and eventually pay their university tuition fees. But Lucy, who suffers from hypermobility syndrome, has had to live off William’s estate since the Department for Work and Pensions stopped her £180 weekly income support and housing benefit payments. Distraught: Lucy Aldridge has been forced to live off her deceased son William's estate after the Department for Work and pensions cut her Disability Allowance . She told the DWP she wanted to put William’s estate in a trust until his brothers, Archie and George, aged eight and seven, start university. Her case was dismissed and when Lucy challenged the DWP’s decision last year, the Ministry of Justice ruled there was no distinction between William’s fund and windfalls such as National Lottery wins and inheritances. Lucy, from Bromyard, Herefordshire, said: . ‘The threshold for a claimant’s savings or assets is £16,000. 'So when I . became administrator of my son’s estate, I lost my means-tested . benefits. Loss: Lucy's son William was killed in Afghanistan three years ago, aged 18 . ‘I’ve been registered disabled for six years. I can’t work and can barely walk to the end of  my road. The DWP’s position punishes me and William because I am disabled. He would turn in his grave if he knew. Week by week I withdraw money from his estate to keep a roof over my head. 'It breaks my heart. Legally, there is nothing I can do to get my benefits back.’ Rifleman William Aldridge, of 2nd Battalion, the Rifles, was just 18 years and 47 days old when he was killed by a Taliban mine in July 2009. Last night Tory MP John Glen said: ‘The law should protect Lucy, not punish her. 'Compensation for the death of  a loved one while serving in war should be treated differently.’ A DWP spokesman said: ‘Money can never compensate for the loss of a loved one, but families of our servicemen and women killed on active duty do receive financial support.’","Lucy Aldridge, 44, has had her £180 weekly benefits cut .

New York is bracing for more tornadoes today after two twisters struck the edges of the city on Saturday, hurling debris into the air and knocking out power lines. No one was injured but there was widespread damage and residents were left stunned. The National Weather Service has issued a severe weather warning for Sunday with locals fleeing the coastline and major sporting events being cancelled. Tornadoes are extremely rare in the largest and most densely populated U.S. city. The first twister hit a beachfront neighborhood and the second, stronger tornado followed moments later about 10 miles away. Scroll down to watch video . Instagram user Bitchesbcrawlin posted this pictured and wrote 'Came home from the gym and saw this bad boy from my deck. Sucks to be in Brooklyn #tornado #beach #water #tanningweather.' Rare sight: A tornado was spotted today off the coast of Coney Island in Brooklyn . Videos taken by bystanders showed a funnel cloud sucking up water, then sand, and then small pieces of buildings, as the first moved through the Breezy Point section of the Rockaway peninsula in Queens. The second hit to the northwest, in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn also near the water, about seven minutes later. The National Weather Service said winds were up to 110 miles per hour, and several homes and trees were damaged. Residents had advance notice. The weather service had issued a tornado warning for Queens and Brooklyn at around 10:40 a.m. The storm took people by surprise anyway when it struck about 20 minutes later. 'I was showing videos of tornadoes to my 4-year-old on my phone, and two minutes later, it hit,' said Breezy Point neighborhood resident Peter Maloney. 'Just like they always say, it sounded like a train.' In the storm's wake, the community of seaside bungalows was littered with broken flower pots, knocked-down fences and smashed windows. At the Breezy Point Surf Club, the tornado ripped the roofs off rows of cabanas, scattered deck chairs and left a heavy metal barbecue and propane tank sitting in the middle of a softball field, at least 100 yards from any nearby home. After the storm: A downed power line lies in the sand in front of damaged cabanas at the Breezy Point Surf Club after the tornado touched down in Queens .

Maher, a worker at Kennedy's Restaurant at the edge of Jamaica Bay, . said she saw a 'swirling cone kind of thing with something flying in it' come down and then head back out into the water toward Brooklyn. 'It was scary. We have all glass so we kept saying, ""Get away from the glass!"" just in case it did come back around,' she said. The National Weather Service issued a . tornado warning for Queens and Brooklyn as the storm moved through the . city at 25mph. It expired at 11.30am. An earlier warning indicated another severe thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado near Sheepshead Bay, or near Flatbush, NBC reported. Help at hand: American Red Cross workers walk past a pile of debris as they come to the assistance of cabana owners at the Breezy Point Surf Club in Queens . Scared: Overcome with emotion, cabana owner Janet Ryan sits on the porch at the Breezy Point Surf Club in the Queens on Sunday . 'It picked up picnic benches. It picked up Dumpsters,' said the club's general manager, Thomas Sullivan. Half an hour later the weather was beautiful, but he had to close the club to clean up the damage. The roof of Bob O'Hara's cabana was torn off, leaving tubes of sunscreen, broken beer bottles and an old TV set exposed to the elements. 'We got a new sunroof,' said O'Hara, who has spent summer weekends at the Breezy Point club for his entire 52 years. 'The TV was getting thrown out anyway,' he added. The second tornado tore through parts of Brooklyn with strong winds, causing structural damage to several homes and felling trees.

The US Air Force Secretary Michael Donley the bomb is ready after years of testing. Bombs away: The Massive Ordnance Penetrator is six times the weight of previous 'bunker-busting' weapons and can blast through 200 feet of concrete . He said: ‘If it needed to go today, we would be ready to do that. ‘We continue to do testing on the bomb to refine its capabilities, and that is ongoing. ‘We also have the capability to go with existing configuration today.’ US military chiefs have openly admitted that the weapon was built to attack fortified nuclear facilities in countries such as Iran and North Korea. Target Iran: Unnamed officials claim the bomb has been designed to disable Iranian nuclear facilities but the Pentagon denies there's specific targets . Ready to go: The US Air Force Secretary Michael Donley said 'if it needed to go today, we would be ready to do that'. Unnamed officials have claimed repeatedly that the super bomb has been designed to disable Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordo or to at least intimidate the capital Tehran but the Pentagon has denied that the delivery of more than 20 MOPs is aimed at a specific target. Recently, UK Secret Intelligence Service chief Sir John Sawers warned against Iran’s program saying the country was only ‘two years away’ from becoming nuclear armed. Iran is working to expand their uranium enrichment facility at Fordo which is built inside a mountain. Senior officials in Tehran had previously declared the facility ‘impregnable’. Natanz, another facility in the centre of the country, is buried under 33 feet feet of earth and 6ft of concrete. Iran has often openly paraded its nuclear program while denying intentions to build nuclear bombs. Redirected funds: Earlier this year the Pentagon redirected $120 million from other weapon programs to develop the MOPs . Whether MOPs could actually destroy Iran's nuclear facilities is open to debate. Earlier this year the Pentagon redirected $120 million from other weapon programs to MOPs. The effectiveness of bunker-buster bombs is dependent on the strength of the soil it dives into, how well it makes contact and the internal structure of the facilities. Two MOPs can be mounted simultaneously on a modified B-52 stealth bomber and a US official has claimed that the efficiency of any operation depends on how many ‘tries at the apple’ the aircraft gets.

Walk-out: Charge d'affaires Khaled al-Ayoubi told the British authorities that he was 'no longer willing' to represent the Syrian government at the embassy in London . Syria's most senior diplomat to Britain yesterday defected in ‘revulsion’ at the violence. He deserted his post as a refugee crisis erupted in Aleppo, Syria’s largest city. Khaled al-Ayoubi, the charge d’affaires in London, told the Foreign Office he could no longer represent President Bashar al-Assad’s brutal regime. More than 200,000 have fled Aleppo after Assad unleashed helicopter gunships and fighter jets on rebels who had seized swathes of the city. An unknown number are still trapped and a serious food shortage is developing. Mr Ayoubi’s unexpected defection represents another crack in Assad’s government, whose suppression of the 18-month uprising has claimed 19,000 lives. The Foreign Office said: ‘Mr Ayoubi has told us that he is no longer willing to represent a regime that has committed such violent and oppressive acts against its own people. ‘We urge others around Bashar al-Assad to follow Mr Ayoubi’s example, to disassociate themselves from the crimes being committed against the Syrian people and to support a peaceful and free future for Syria.’ A spokesman said it was not known if Mr Ayoubi would transfer his support to the rebels. He was staying in a safe location in the UK and was in contact with British officials, he said. Mr Ayoubi’s departure leaves five staff at the Syrian embassy after his predecessor and two others were expelled at the end of May, and Syria’s ambassador to the UK Sami Khiyami quit, citing ‘ill health’.

A man who 'smiled' as he shot his ex-wife's husband six times in 'cold blood' has been found guilty of his murder. Cristobal Palacio, 46, was found guilty of the second degree murder of Paul Winter, 42, originally from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in October 2008. Mr Winter was shot dead in front of his wife Jennifer and her and Palacio's six-year-old twins at the murderer's home in Kendall, Miami, Florida. British ex-pat Paul Winter, who met his American wife on the Internet, was shot dead by her furious ex-husband . At Miami's Gerstein Justice Building, Palacio denied murder, claiming he had to shoot in self-defence after he was 'harassed' by the Briton. The murderer, who was originally charged with first degree murder, told the jury that on two occasions Mr Winter had put a gun to his head, 'hunted' him and threatened him, the Miami Herald reported . Mourning: Jennifer Winter, whose British husband Paul was shot dead by her ex-husband Cristobal Palacio on her birthday . His defence lawyer, Michael Walsh, said Palacio 'exercised his most basic human right' because he acted in fear of is own life, according to the newspaper. The bank security executive, who had gone through a bitter divorce with his former wife, shot Mr Winter six times, including twice in the back, while he 'smiled', his daughter told jurors, the Miami Herald reported. The brute, who killed Mr Winter on Jennifer's 37th birthday, said he had armed himself for daily routines, like collecting his post or walking the dog, said he shot his former wife's husband because he thought he was warmed. But the victim was unarmed and had driven to Palacio's home to drop off his step-children for a court-arranged access visit. The killing followed an acrimonious divorce after the couple had been married for 12 years, and a bitter custody battle over Palacio's twin children. Mr Winter had met his new wife online, married her in 2007 threee days after her divorce was settled and moved to Miami. The Miami Herald reported that the version of events surrounding the killing differed. Mrs Winter said Palacio stormed out of his house in a rage, screaming profanities, and then shot her husband. But Palacio said he was not expecting a visit from the couple and was at home with his girlfriend. The . Miami Herald reported that Gabriel Hernandez, a ballistics expert, said . that after examining Winter's wounds, the .40 caliber SIG Sauer Palacio . that was used must have been fired from just three feet away. Smiling killer: Cristobal Palacio stormed out of his house brandishing a gun and murdered his ex-wife's husband . Mark . Shuman, of the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner's office, also told jurors . that Paul Winter's back injuries were contact wounds, meaning he had to . be against a hard surface when he was shot.

Jurors . decided to convict Palacio of the lesser murder charge which carries a . mandatory life sentence, with a minimum of 20 years behind bars. He was also convicted of two counts of child abuse, as a result of his children having witnessed the shooting. Palacio, . who worked as a fraud investigator for Citibank for more than 25 years, . had claimed that Mr Winter had threatened him with a gun on two . previous occasions. But Mr Winter's wife said he had not owned a gun. Mr .

Glenn Hawkins, 35, was left with a broken collar bone, punctured lung and two cracked ribs after coming off his £8,000 Kawasaki ZX-6R on a city centre road. Seconds later, a passer-by pretended to lend him a hand by moving his green-and-black sports bike, which still had the keys in the ignition. Despicable: Glenn Hawkins had his motorbike stolen by a passerby posing as a Good Samaritan as he lay seriously injured in Bond Street, Bristol, (above) after a crash . But instead of helping, the crook roared off with the powerful 600cc machine as his victim lay stricken in the road. Speaking from his hospital bed, construction manager Glenn said: 'I was pretty annoyed and that’s putting it lightly. 'If I had got hold of him, he would have ended up in the hospital bed next to me. Now I just want to get my bike back. 'If anyone sees it, or the thief who stole it, I would really appreciate it if they called the police as soon as possible.' Glenn, from Redland, Bristol, was on the way to get his motorbike serviced last Wednesday when a cyclist stepped out in front of him. The crash, at 10.30am on Bristol’s Bond Street near the city’s Cabot Circus shopping centre, sent him flying off his bike and sprawling into the road. When dazed Glenn looked around, he was stunned to be told his bike had been nicked by a man described as being stocky, black and wearing a black and white hooded top. The crash victim had only bought the bike - known as a ‘Ninja’ - one month ago and describes it as 'my baby'. Glenn said: 'I came off my bike and skidded along the road. When I got up I said ‘where’s my bike?’ and I was told someone had stolen it. ' He was forced to spend five days at Bristol Royal Infirmary, including his birthday, and is expected to miss another fortnight of work while he recovers. As well as the broken bones, Glenn had to have four stitches in his left leg and suffered painful friction burns. The cyclist escaped uninjured, but was shaken up by the ordeal. Glenn, who has ridden bikes since he was a teenager, said: 'I might need physio and more treatment - so I don’t know when I’ll be able to ride a motorbike again.' Avon and Somerset Police confirmed they were hunting the suspect and the motorbike. A spokesman said: 'While Mr Hawkins was being treated, someone offered to help move his motorcycle out of the way and then rode off on it in the direction of Portland Square. 'Despite an extensive search of the area by local response officers, the stolen motorbike was not located. 'Other inquiries, including the examination of CCTV, are underway to identify the person responsible and return the bike to the owner.'","Glenn Hawkins, 35, seriously injured in collision with cyclist in city centre .

One of the oldest women in Pennsylvania received a long-overdue benefit bump after the survivor payments she from her deceased husband’s WWI service went from $36 per month to $1,000. Because of her diligent son who spent years trying to get Alda Collin’s veteran’s benefits increased, the 110-year-old woman got a significant boost to her bank account. Mrs Collins’ husband William served in the Cavalry of the U.S. Army during World War I and was stationed in Mexico and Texas ‘because they had some skirmishes down there,’ his son Jim told MailOnline. Happy couple: William Collins married Alda before he served in the Army during WWI and when he died at the age of 81 in 1976, she began receiving his veteran's benefits which were $36-per-month . Back in time: Alda's husband William served as in the U.S. Army's Cavalry during WWI and his son says that he was stationed in Mexico and Texas because 'there were some skirmishes down there' at the time . When Mr Collins died when he was . 81-years-old in 1976, that is when his widow Alda began receiving his . veterans benefits. At the time, those benefits were set at $36 per . month. Those benefits . provided some help to Ms Collins initially, as the cost of living was . much lower and the former teacher was living by herself in a trailer for . many years. When she . turned 106-years-old, her son moved her into St. Benedict’s Manor . nursing home and he says that though she just turned 110 last week . earning her the title of one of the top three oldest women in . Pennsylvania, she is still in good health. ‘She . still feeds herself and uses a walker to get around. She subscribes to . The National Enquirer and reads that all the time,’ Jim, 73, said. Family support: Alda and William had two children, William II (far right) who has since died and Jim (far left) who is now 73-years-old and has pushed for his mother's benefits to be increased . Though she is comfortable, that has little to do with the minimal veterans benefits which have clearly not kept up with inflation. In 2008, Jim first sent a letter to the office of veteran’s affairs in hopes of increasing their monthly pay out, but he heard little back and ‘just got form letters every month for years’. After seeing a television ad for Congressman Mark Critz which touted the work he did for senior citizens, the dutiful son called his office and inquired about getting some help to move the issue up the ladder. Six weeks later, the monthly check was raised without notice from $36 to $1,000. Now Mrs Collins will receive an additional $25,000 in back benefits starting from the date of Jim’s first 2008 inquiry. ‘If I’d have known I would have applied much sooner,’ he told MailOnline. Today: Jim joins his mother Alda in St. Benedict Manor nursing home, and she turned 110 last week . Together for decades: Alda was a schoolteacher in a one-room school and William returned home from WWI and became a barber . Though the sudden check increase stunned Jim, it still hasn’t quite sunk in for his mother, who used to be a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse that was heated only by a potbelly stove. ‘At her age, she didn’t quite believe it and she doesn’t realize how much her nursing home and care costs,’ he said. Democratic Congressman Critz, who represents Pennsylvania’s 12th district, told the local paper that his office was happy to help. ‘It is really just an awesome outcome,’ he told The Tribune Democrat. He posted the story on his Facebook page and urged other seniors to seek assistance if they were not receiving the benefits that they deserved. ‘You can’t help but feel like Mr Collins found a way to say “Happy Birthday” to his wife and just had my office deliver the card.’ Though Mrs Collins herself is a self-described Republican, who fondly remembers the time she was able to serve coffee to then-Vice President Richard Nixon, Mr Critz has found a fan in her son who will have to contribute less every month to his mother’s expenses because of the benefit increase. ‘I’m Independent so I couldn’t vote for him in the primaries but I will certainly be voting for him now!’ Jim said of Congressman Critz.","Alda Collin's husband William served in the Cavalry in World War I .

'Low': Cocaine addict Naseer Laher, pictured, mugged the girl for pocket money in the outrageous attack . A cocaine addict mugged an eight-year-old girl  for just £3.50 as she walked to the shop to buy sweets. Naseer Laher, 31, was jailed for four years and three months after a court heard how he cornered Chelsea Dixon in an alleyway  in Batley Carr, West Yorkshire. A judge told him: 'It doesn’t get much lower than that' as he sentenced the criminal yesterday. Chelsea had only a few coins with her, enough to buy sweets from the post office and send letters she had written to her brother Lewis, who was serving in Afghanistan. Her purse had belonged to her beloved grandmother, who had died four weeks before she was attacked on March 15, Leeds Crown Court heard. Laher, of Batley, approached her about 4.30pm and asked how much money she had, according to prosecutor Shamaila Quereshi. She told him she did not have any, but he grabbed the purse and hurt her wrist during the struggle. A witness saw Laher run away after the attack and went to help the youngster, who was deeply distressed. Laher was arrested and denied the offence, claiming he had been . appearing in court at the time. Chelsea later picked him out at an identity parade. Terrified: Chelsea Dixon was deeply distressed after the attack in the quiet alleyway, pictured, and is now afraid to go out . At the time of the offence, Laher, who pleaded guilty to robbery at an earlier hearing, was already subject to a community order imposed after he burgled the home of one of his relatives. Ms Quereshi said Chelsea’s purse has never been recovered and the little girl was crushed, because she had been very close to her grandmother. She is now afraid to be on her own, the court heard, and is scared to return to the post office. Chelsea’s mother, Amanda Dixon, described her daughter in a statement as being 'very brave' in helping the police and identifying her attacker. 'Feeding his addiction': Laher, 31, was jailed for four years and three months at Leeds Crown Court (pictured) for targeting the young girl . Judge Christopher Batty told Laher: 'No doubt she was hugely proud of the fact that she had the purse of her grandmother, who had died only a month before. 'Little did she know she was going to encounter you, a cocaine addict for many years.' He added: 'She was easy prey to feed your addiction.' After the hearing, Det Con Paul Greatorex, of Kirklees CID, said: 'It is hard to understand what would compel a grown man to rob a child for such a small amount of money.' After the incident in March, Chelsea’s mother said: 'She just came running home, she was a mess. 'That night she wanted to sleep with me and she didn’t go to school the next day.' Miss Dixon, said at the time that her daughter had been ‘distraught’ after the purse was snatched. 'It is all the more painful because of the sentimental value attached to it,' she added.","Chelsea Dixon was carrying a purse that had belonged to her grandmother and letters to her soldier brother .

Detectives said the van, which was . hired legitimately from Salford Van Hire at 4.40pm last Thursday, was . found abandoned at the end of Luke Road, near the entrance to Lees Park, . shortly after Friday's attacks.

But, . by 2008 he had been locked up for five years - and branded a dangerous . young man by a judge sentencing him for robbery and grievous bodily . harm. The amateur boxer had been one of a gang of three who carjacked a 60-year-old man in Clayton. Short had gone on to knock a shopkeeper unconscious in an attack three months later.

Parents Lorraine and Robert Wingate are keeping vigil at the bedside of their son Callum, who is fighting for his life at Leeds General Infirmary . Lorraine Wingate, pictured right, with Callum, said she is in a 'nightmare'. She described her son as 'amazing, giving and generous' The schoolboy had been at the bottom of the water for several minutes when he was pulled out by his father Robert Wingate, who described him as ‘lying there dead’. Mr Wingate and his wife Lorraine are now keeping vigil at his bedside at Leeds General Infirmary since he was flown home around two weeks ago. Callum has already defied Spanish doctors who told his parents that they were ‘bringing him home to die’. Callum Wingate, right, pictured with his father Robert Wingate before the accident. It was Mr Wingate who pulled Callum out of the water . Mrs Wingate, a childminder, said: ‘It still seems like a nightmare and at some point I’m going to wake up. ‘He’s an amazing kid - giving, generous, he doesn’t think of himself. He loves learning, he loves fishing. He loves life. ‘I miss him. I know he’s here but I miss his laugh, I miss his cuddles.’ Mr Wingate added: ‘He’s fighting. We have got to believe he can get better.’ The accident happened at around 8am on the first morning of the family holiday, when Callum, had been playing in a shallow part of the pool. It is thought he slipped into the deeper water - more than two metres deep - while mum Lorraine, 35, was distracted. She assumed he had walked off with his 13-year-old brother Robert, but was alerted several minutes later by her other son, James, 12, who spotted Callum’s lifeless body at the bottom of the pool. Mr Lingate, 48, jumped in to pull him out, but he was not breathing. Mrs Lingate said: ‘He was just pure blue. He was dead. Mr Lingate added: ‘You can’t describe what it’s like to see your bairn lying their dead.’ After being revived, Callum spent 12 days in a Spanish hospital before being flown home to the UK. Mrs Lingate added: ‘They told us we were bringing him home to die. ‘As long as he’s alive, I know I can deal with whatever else is wrong with him.’ Callum, who is effectively comatose, has regular spasms and is likely to have suffered long-term brain damage.

Objection: ICANN plans to allow hundreds of new 'top-level domains', the first of which will go live next year, but the Saudi government has launched objections to 160 of them . The Vatican had bid to create domains ending in .catholic, saying it was 'a recognition of how important the digital space is for the church'. But the Saudi authorities have argued that it 'cannot demonstrate that it possesses a monopoly over the term ""Catholic'"". It also objected to .gay labelling it 'offensive' adding that 'many societies . and cultures consider homosexuality to be contrary to their culture, . morality or religion'. These objections are just some of more than 160 sent by the Saudi Communication and Information Technology Commission  to ICANN, The Daily Telegraph reported. In its complaint about The Vatican's request, the commission said: 'Many other Christians use the term ""Catholic"" to refer more broadly to the whole Christian Church regardless of denominational affiliation.

'The values expressed in pornography clash with the family concept and they undermine the traditional values that promote marriage, family, and children.' The Saudis also objected to .tattoo as tattooing is prohibited in Islam and Judaism and to .bar on grounds that because of its association with alcohol the term 'promotes activities that can be detrimental to public order and morals'. A similar plan to create a .pub top-level domain aimed primarily at British landlords also angered the Saudi government. There are currently only 364 top-level domains, most referring to countries, but the U.S.-based quango is now considering applications to create almost 2,000 more.

A total . of £7,873,478 in donations was reported to the Electoral Commission . between April and June: down £992,312 on the figure for the first three . months of the year. The Conservatives accepted £3,785,579 – down by around £250,000 on the previous quarter. Labour was trailing behind on . £2,964,471; down some £450,000 on the first quarter of 2012. However, . Lib Dem donations rose slightly to £717,797. Labour backbench MP Simon Danczuk . said: ‘David Cameron’s cosy dinners in No 10 have helped the Tories rake . in hundreds of thousands from millionaire donors  in the last few . months, while over a million pounds has flooded into Tory coffers via . their exclusive Leader’s Club events where ministers rub shoulders with . only the very biggest donors. ‘With each day that passes it’s clear . that David Cameron’s Government is completely out of touch – wining and . dining the millionaires they gave a tax cut to in the Budget while . millions are paying more.’ In March, the Prime Minister was . forced to release a list of donors who had visited him at Downing Street . or his country residence, Chequers. The Electoral Commission figures . reveal that the Tories’ largest donation was £512,450 from one of those . who had been invited to Mr Cameron’s home, financier Michael Farmer. Other attendees who have donated money since the meetings were Lord . Stanley Fink (£74,000) and Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman of JCB . (£60,000). The Tories also raised hundreds of . thousands from people who attended Leader’s Group meals with senior . figures including Mr Cameron. Last night a spokesman for the Conservative Party denied that those who met the Prime Minister had influence over policy. ‘The Conservative Party continues to . enjoy a high level of financial support from generous philanthropists . committed to improving peoples’ lives across Britain,’ she said. Criticism: Nick Clegg came under attack last year after it was revealed he had dinner with Brompton's owner Rumi Verjee . ‘The Prime Minister occasionally has . dinner with party donors, as do other party leaders. There is no . suggestion of influence over government policy as a result of donations. Between them, these individuals give less than a quarter of the total . money donated to the Conservative Party.’ The spokesman pointed out that . Ed Miliband had dined with the leaders of Unite, Unison and Usdaw – . which between them gave £1,468,000 last quarter. The figures from the Electoral . Commission show that after the three main parties, the Greens came next . with £180,060 in donations. The British National Party took . £100,000 while UKIP garnered £29,370. Plaid Cymru recorded £17,500 while . the Scottish National Party only had £2,500. LABOUR is still in hock to union barons, it was claimed yesterday. Between April and June, some 70 per cent of the party’s donations – more than £2million – came from trade unions. The Conservatives said this was proof that the party was overwhelmingly reliant on the unions. However, Labour pointed out that the figures did not include revenue from ordinary members through their fees. Majority from trade unions: Since Ed Miliband became Labour leader, 81 per cent of the party's donations came from trade unions. Under Gordon Brown it was 59 per cent . The Electoral Commission report  showed that since Ed Miliband became Labour leader, 81 per cent of the party’s donations came from the trade unions. Under Gordon Brown, the figure was 59 per cent. Labour’s biggest individual donor was Unite, the union led by the militant Len McCluskey. In the previous quarter it gave over £800,000, and since Mr Miliband took over it has given more than £6million. Conservative Party co-chairman Baroness Warsi said: ‘The boss of Labour’s biggest donor is threatening British businesses with more strikes as his trade union continues its takeover of the Labour party. ‘With Labour still overwhelmingly reliant on union cash, it’s clear Ed Miliband is too weak to stand up to Len McCluskey and the other barons who anointed him Labour leader.’ Ed Miliband was only elected leader with the help of the union vote. Labour MPs and party members chose his brother, David. The figures show that Labour received £2.96million in public donations, of which £2.07million came from the unions. Unite gave £840,725 – in itself a massive 28 per cent of total donations. It was the largest single donation to any party. Labour received £429,558 from the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers; and £313,863 from the GMB. Another £213,000 came from Unison. A Labour source said it was wrong to suggest that the unions had undue influence over the party leadership. ‘We welcome the unions’ support but it would be wrong to suggest that in any way it gains them undue influence over policy or that they are the sole source of the party’s funding,’ he added. A Unite spokesman said trade union donations were among the ‘cleanest money in politics’ and are transparently given.","Tories got the most cash gifts between April and June this year out of a total £7.8m handed to all parties .
More than half Labour's donations come from unions, but got £500,000 less than three months earlier .
A rift between union leaders and Labour over policy is being blamed ."

Wisdom: The renowned astrophysicist told more than a billion viewers worldwide to 'look up at the stars, and not down at your feet... be curious' It had to be the most colourful and energetic lecture Stephen Hawking has ever given. Britain's greatest living scientist launched the Paralympic opening ceremony with a Big Bang last night, beginning with a plea to more than a billion viewers across the planet, simply, to 'be curious'. The renowned astrophysicist took centre stage during the extravaganza as he guided his audience through a 'journey of discovery of the wonder of science'. As a giant flaming orb descended from the heavens, Prof Hawking's instantly recognisable computerised voice boomed through the arena - and offered some choice words of advice. As one of Britain's most iconic symbols of human triumph over adversity, Prof Hawking wheeled onto the stage and implored the world to 'look up at the stars, not down at your feet'. The 70-year-old, who has lived with debilitating motor neurone disease since the age of 22, went on to lead  the 62,000-strong audience through a . 'journey of discovery' - which organisers said was inspired by his . seminal book A Brief History of Time. But despite his illness leaving him . almost completely paralysed and unable to speak, he said: 'We live in a universe governed by rational laws that we can discover and understand. 'Look up at the stars, and not down at your feet. 'Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.' From there on, the spectacular was punctuated by the authoritative voice of Britain's greatest living scientist. 'There ought to be something very special about the boundary conditions . of the universe, and what can be more special than that there is no . boundary,' he echoed later. 'And there should be no boundary to human endeavour.' Prof Hawking's . countless scientific papers, best-selling books and numerous awards have . earned him comparisons with Albert Einstein and Sir Isaac Newton. Disabled genius: In his instantly-recognisable computerised voice, Britain's greatest living scientist told the audience, 'Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist' Inspiration: As one of Britain's most powerful symbols of human triumph over adversity, Prof Hawking, 70, has lived with the debilitating illness motor neurone disease since the age of 22 . But Prof Hawking is as much a . celebrity as he is a scientist, appearing on TV cartoon The Simpsons, . starring in Star Trek and providing narration for a British Telecom . commercial that was later sampled on a Pink Floyd album. In . the 1970s, already confined to a wheelchair, he produced a stream of . first class research, including probably his most important contribution . to cosmology. Genius: Stephen Hawking at his Oxford University graduation in 1962 - two years before his diagnosis with motor neurone disease . This was the discovery of Hawking radiation, which allows a black hole to leak energy and gradually fade away to nothing. By . applying quantum mechanics to black holes, he had taken the first steps . to combining quantum theory and general relativity. One describes the . universe at the sub-atomic level, and the other at very large scales. Bringing the two theories together is one of the great unfulfilled goals . of modern physics. In the 1980s, Prof Hawking and . Professor Jim Hartle, from the University of California at Santa . Barbara, proposed a model of the universe which had no boundaries in . space or time. The concept was described in A Brief History Of Time, which sold 25 million copies worldwide. In . recent years, Prof Hawking has examined the relationship between . science and religion, writing a 2010 book, Grand Design, which argues . that evoking God is not necessary to explain the origins of the . universe. He met the Pope at a scientific event hosted by the Pontifical . Academy of Sciences in 2008. To the sound of Rhianna's hit song 'Umbrella', the dancers - many of whom have physical disabilities - then glided apart to reveal a giant umbrella at the centre of the stage.

The . extravaganza, directed by Bradley Hemmings and Jenny Sealey, was billed . as a voyage across 'a sea of ideas' - including Isaac Newton's . discovery of gravity, which all Earth-bound athletes strive against. Powerful symbol: As one of Britain's most iconic symbols of human triumph over adversity, Prof Hawking, 70, has lived with the debilitating illness motor neurone disease since the age of 22 . Science to the masses: Some of Prof Hawking's books including his international bestseller A Brief History Of Time . Hemmings said: 'Our talks with Stephen Hawking began towards the end of last year. 'We . worked very closely with Professor Hawking to develop a series of . messages which are very much integrated into the storytelling of the . ceremony. Motor neurone disease (MND) attacks the nervous system and leaves . muscles damaged, causing loss of mobility and difficulties with speech, . swallowing and breathing. One in 50,000 people are diagnosed . with the disease each year and sufferers usually die within five years . of its onset. Its cause is a mystery but some experts believe an . individual's damaged genetic make-up might be a contributory factor. There is currently no cure. Stephen Hawking, who is confined to a wheelchair, is the world's . best known sufferer of the most common form of motor neurone fisease - . amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. He is an exceptional case, having survived for more than 40 years, despite doctors giving him just two years to live when first diagnosed. 'We have spent time with him in Cambridge and have been so incredibly gratified with him giving his time. 'Everybody . knows about Professor Hawking and his extraordinary theoretical work . and writings about science which have made very complex ideas accessible . to all of us, but what came through in our meetings with him was the . humanity and the humour of him.

'Both Hawking and McKellen in their narrative talk about what we all need to remember; don’t just look down at your feet, look at the stars, be curious.' The show included 73 deaf and disabled professional performers and 68 disabled people among its 3,250 volunteers.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange made his first public appearance for two months today as he taunted the US government by giving a speech from a balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy in London.. The 41-year-old gave a relaxed seven-minute statement demanding President Barack Obama end America's 'war on whistleblowers' and call off its FBI investigation of the leak of tens of thousands of diplomatic cables. Assange, who British security sources said would be arrested if he put one 'toe' outside the Ecuadorian embassy, appears to be relishing his position as political asylum seeker, having been holed up for two months as he seeks to avoid extradition from Britain. The Australian began his balcony address by declaring: 'I am here today because I cannot be there with you today' - referring to his asylum bid which has become costly and embarrassing for the British government. Scroll down for video . Controversial: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange made his first public appearance in two months yesterday to demand the American government's 'war on whistleblowers' must end . Outspoken: He also said he had taken a 'stand for justice' and praised the 'courageous South American nation' of Ecuador,which has granted him political asylum . Worried: During the seven minute speech, he said: 'As WikiLeaks stands under threat so does the freedom of expression and the health of all our democracies' Crowded: Hundreds of supporters, journalists and police officers filled the Knightsbridge street to listen to Assange speak . Assange was granted asylum by Ecuador  on Thursday as he seeks to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over sexual misconduct allegations. The WikiLeaks founder has been trapped in the embassy for almost two months without having been seen or heard from. Hundreds of his supporters had gathered . to listen to the Australian as well as vast amounts of global media. There was also about 100 police officers. Assange made his speech from the safety of a small balcony at the Ecuadorian embassy knowing that if he stepped foot outside he would be arrested. During the speech, he said: 'I ask President Obama to do the right thing. The United States must renounce its witch hunt against WikiLeaks. 'The United States must dissolve its FBI. investigation. The United States must vow that it will not seek to prosecute our staff or our supporters.' 'The US must pledge that it will not pursue journalists for shining a light on the powerful. 'There . must be no more foolish talk about prosecuting any news organsations. The US administration's war on whistleblowers must end.' He also hailed US Army intelligence officer Bradley Manning, the man who allegedly handed over the documents to WikiLeaks, as a 'hero' and called him 'one of the world's foremost political prisoners.' Protected: Assange, centre , made his speech from the safety of a balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy knowing that if he stepped foot outside the embassy he would be arrested by police officers . Grateful: Assange praised the 'courage' shown by the South American nation's president for granting him asylum . Speaking out: This picture taken from inside the embassy shows the vast support and police presence in front of Assange . Assange said that WikiLeaks' work was helping to defend the world from the tyranny of world governments and the secrets they keep. 'As WikiLeaks stands under threat so does the freedom of expression and the health of all our democracies. 'We must use this moment to . articulate the choice before the government of the U.S. Will it revert . to the values it was founded on or will it launch off the precipice . dragging us all into a dark, repressive world in which journalists live . under fear of prosecution. During his speech he also thanked Ecuador for granting him asylum. He said: 'I thank President Rafael Correa for the courage he has shown in considering and granting me political asylum.' He also offered an apology to his family, saying: 'To my family and my children who have been denied their father, forgive me. We will be reunited soon.' It also emerged today that Assange has instructed his lawyers 'to carry out a legal action' to protect his rights. His legal adviser Baltasar Garzon . emerged from the Ecuadorian embassy in London before Assange spoke and said: . 'I have spoken to Julian Assange and I can tell you he is in fighting . spirits and he is thankful to the people of Ecuador and especially to . the president for granting asylum.

Fighting back: Julian Assange's legal adviser Baltasar Garzon, pictured, said today that Assange has instructed his lawyers to carry out legal action to protect the rights of himself and WikiLeaks . 'Julian Assange has always fought for truth and justice and has defended human rights and continues to do so. 'He demands that WikiLeaks and his own rights be respected. 'Julian . Assange has instructed his lawyers to carry out a legal action in order . to protect the rights of WikiLeaks, Julian himself and all those . currently being investigated.' Assange shot to international prominence in 2010 when his WikiLeaks . website began publishing a huge trove of American diplomatic and . military secrets - including 250,000 U.S. embassy cables that highlight . the sensitive, candid and often embarrassing backroom dealings of U.S. diplomats. As he toured the globe to highlight the disclosures, two women accused him of sex offences during a trip to Sweden. Outside the embassy today, Crowds chanted slogans such as 'I am Julian', 'Julian Assange freedom . fighter' and 'Only one decision, no extradition' as Mr Assange came on . to the balcony wearing a blue shirt, burgundy tie and dark trousers. Militants from anti-capitalist movements such as Occupy and 'hacktivist' group Anonymous were present. There was also a significant contingent of South American supporters chanting slogans in Spanish. They carried placards with messages such as: 'You Won't Stop WikiLeaks - . They Changed The World Already' and 'Free Press Free Assange'. Tristan, an unemployed 29-year-old, has been camped out in front of the . embassy since Thursday to show his support for Mr Assange and WikiLeaks. Protest: Supporters of the WikiLeaks founder hold placards as they demonstrate outside the Ecuadorian Embassy yesterday . Solidarity: There was a huge presence of Assange supporters outside the embassy . 'I will be staying here for as long as it takes,' he said after the speech. 'I would like for the British Government to let him (Mr Assange) go to . Ecuador or Sweden if the Swedish agree to their original terms and give a . guarantee he will not be extradited. 'He has already asked the Swedish authorities to come here to . investigate, he is willing to defend himself against the allegations. 'All he wants is an assurance he will not be extradited to America just for exposing the truth.' Laura Mattson, a 29-year-old supporter from London, said she had been greatly impressed by Mr Assange's words. Asked whether she thought Mr Assange should face the accusations against . him, she said: 'Is it about the charges or is it about silencing . WikiLeaks? 'I think these allegations are just a way of getting to him. 'I used to take WikiLeaks for granted but now things are getting very serious and I feel I must take a stand,' she added. Last . night, the diplomatic row over Julian Assange escalated when the . President of Ecuador warned Britain that any attempt to storm its . embassy in London would destroy relations between the two countries. Keeping watch: Police officers stand outside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London yesterday before Mr Assange spoke to the Press . Warning: Ecuador's President Rafael Correa warned Britain off storming its embassy during his weekly broadcast in Loja . Rafael Correa used his weekly address . to the nation to deliver his strongest warning to Britain yet, . describing the UK’s stance as ‘grotesque’ and ‘intolerant’. He said if British police ‘violated Ecuador’s diplomatic mission’ in London it would destroy ties between the two countries. Mr . Correa said: ‘The United Kingdom threat would be breaking the law and . encroaching on our embassy. I don’t know who they think I am or what . they think our government is. But how could they expect us to yield to . their threats or cower before them? My friends, they don’t know who they . are dealing with.’ The . comments are likely to be welcomed on the streets of Ecuador, where . anti-colonial feeling runs high. Meanwhile, the country’s position is . attracting growing international support. Assange has been trapped in the embassy for almost two months without having been seen or heard from. Britain . is adamant the WikiLeaks founder should be extradited to Sweden so he . can answer sex charges, which he denies. But Assange and his supporters . claim he should be allowed safe passage to Ecuador because its . government has already granted him political asylum. Assange, whose leaks have proved embarrassing for the US government, fears that if he is forced to return to Sweden he will be extradited to America, where his life could be in danger. Last week, Ministers threatened to strip the embassy of its diplomatic status so police could storm it and arrest Assange. Sources believe the chances of that have diminished but insist Assange will be arrested if  he leaves the building.","Hundreds of supporters gather to listen to controversial and provocative speech from balcony of Ecuadorian embassy .

Probed: The FBI reportedly investigated sci-fi master Ray Bradbury during the 1960s for alleged communist leanings and sympathies . American lit legend Ray Bradbury was probed by the FBI during the 1960s for alleged communist leanings and sympathies, according to The Huffington Post. The revelation comes through a review of the Fahrenheit 451 author's FBI files, released to The  Post in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. Bradbury, a 2004 National Medal of Arts Award winner, died in June. G-Men apparently surveilled the sci-fic legend's LA home around 1968 and tracked whether he traveled to Communist Cuba during the same year to participate the Cultural Congress at the Havana Libre Hotel. Scroll Down for Video . Bradbury's file reportedly contained, among other things, his resume, background as well as subversive information,' which included the notation that he had a 'diagonal scar' on the left side of his forehead. The Bradbury dossier was ultimately added to Bureau's larger 'Communist Infiltration of the Radio-Television Industry,' The Huffington Post reports. The Bureau, however, eventually concluded the author was not a communist after discussing the issue with various other informants. 'No evidence has been developed which indicates he was ever a member of the CP [Communist Party],' reportedly reads the Bradbury file. In the end, the Bureau did not decide to interview the author about the topic. Shocking Revelation: The news comes through a review of the author's FBI file, obtained by The Huffington Post in reply to a Freedom of Information Act request . Most of the file, The Huffington Post reports, is filled with the muddled and circuitous logic of Bradbury's main accuser, screenwriter Martin Berkeley, who actually WAS a member of the communist party. Berkeley, the file notes, told the Bureau that some of Bradbury's stories, 'have been definitely slanted against the United States and its capitalistic form of government.' Concerning Berkeley, the file reportedly said, 'Informant stated that the general aim of these science fiction writers is to frighten the people into a state of paralysis or psychological incompetence bordering on hysteria. That hysteria, the file notes, 'would make it very possible to conduct a Third World War in which the American people would seriously believe [sic] could not be won since their morale had been seriously destroyed.' The Accuser: Bradbury's chief accuser turns out to be screenwriter Martin Berkeley, who was a 'card-carrying' community party member, himself. Berkeley penned such movies as Revenge of the Creature . Berkeley reportedly told the FBI Bradbury was 'probably sympathetic with certain pro-Communist elements' in the Screen Writers Guild, The Huffington Post reports. And the stool-pigeon told G-men Bradbury once stood up to vocally dencounce guild members as 'Cowards and McCarthyites' for considering a resolution that would have prevented Communists and writers from joining who invoked their 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination before the House Committee on Un-American Activites. Berkeley ended up reportedly telling the committee that 155 people in Hollywood were active communists. His betrayal, The Huffington Post reports, doomed his career, as he was relegated to penning B-movies like 'Tarantula' and 'The Deadly Mantis.' Under Watch: Bradbury's Los Angeles home was under FBI surveillance as late as 1968, according to his FBI file .","Revelation comes through a review of author's FBI file, obtained by The Huffington Post in reply to a Freedom of Information Act request .

The bulletproof armoured car that kept Al Capone safe from his enemies is up for auction for £325,000. The U.S, gangster’s 1928 Cadillac V-8 Town Sedan was fitted with 3,000lb of steel armour and painted green with black fenders to mimic a police car, with flashing lights, a siren and police-band radio receiver. The bulletproof windows could be raised to reveal holes through which machine guns could be fired, while the rear window could be dropped to let his henchman fire on those chasing them. Untouchable: A Cadillac which was kitted out with steel armour and bulletproof windows to protect its owner - legendary Chicago gangster Al Capone - is going on sale . Capone was eventually jailed for tax . evasion, and ironically his 84-year-old car is classed as a classic and . is therefore tax exempt. Latterly owned by a U.S. car collector, it will be sold at RM Auctions in California on August 20. The car even had a flashing light, siren and the first police-band radio receiver in private hands. To further protect its precious load the bulletproof glass windows could be wound further than normal to reveal circular holes through which machine guns could be fired. And in case this was not enough to deter any drivers taking up the chase, the rear window of the ride was rigged to drop at an instant so Capone’s henchmen could open fire at any following cars. The car, which is thought to have been . briefly used by President Franklin Roosevelt after Capone was imprisoned . for tax evasion, is expected to fetch a six figure sum at auction. Decked out: Al Capone would have been safe in this one, the 1928 Cadillac V-8 Town Sedan has 3,000lbs of steel armour fitted and was used by President Roosevelt after Capone's imprisonment . Machine gun friendly: The bullet proof glass had muzzle sized holes for Capone and his fellow gangsters to fit their guns and even a drop down rear window, pictured, to mow down pursuers . Considering his crime – the one he was . imprisoned for – Capone would probably have been pleased to know that . his old car, being 84-years-old, is classed as a classic and is . therefore tax exempt. After . Capone’s imprisonment the vehicle went on to be shown around the world, . even making a trip to the UK in the 1950’s displayed at the . Southend-on-Sea amusement park and at the Blackpool funfair. It later entered the collection of the . US motor enthusiast John O'Quinn who died last year in a car crash and . it is now being sold as part of his estate. The car is going on sale at the end of August and is expected to fetch £325,000 at the auction . In . their research into the origins of the car, auctioneers uncovered . 92-year-old Richard Capstran, whose mechanic father fitted the armour. He said Capone's mobsters arrived and told him what they wanted doing. Mr Capstran said: ‘My dad said “we don't do that kind of work here,” and they said “you do now.”’ The car was then backed into the garage so no one could see what was happening to it. Mr . Capstran said Capone turned up to pay the bill himself and even gave . the ten-year-old Mr Capstran a ten dollar note - a small fortune to a . young boy at the time. A . spokesman for RM Auctions said: ‘This is . widely considered as one of the most historically significant pre-war . American cars. ‘It is . liveried in green with black fenders to mirror the Cadillacs supplied to . the Chicago police and city officials at the time. ‘It . is one of the earliest surviving ""bulletproof"" cars and was fitted new . with heavy glass measuring nearly an inch thick and completely lined . with 3,000lbs of steel armour plating. ‘‘It has undergone restoration and is a fabulous piece of history.’ Alphonse 'Al' Capone was born to Italian immigrants in Brooklyn, New York in 1899. After being kicked out of school aged 14 . he became involved in local teenage gangs and  but moved to Chicago in . his early twenties to take advantage of the thriving market for illegal . alcohol during the first years of Prohibition. Capone, imprisoned for tax evasion, would probably have a laugh at his old ride being tax exempt . There he ran prostitution rings, illegal gambling halls but made most of his money running speakeasy bars where thirsty Chicago dwellers could get their hands on banned alcohol. He rose to become the leader of 'The Chicago Outfit' gang, which later became known as 'The Capone Family' and ruled the streets of Chicago from the early 1920's until his capture in 1931. Despite his gangster ways Capone was a highly visible public figure in Chicago and even opened charity soup kitchens and worked for the safety of the city's children . Capone has been credited with ordering one of the most famous mass murders in 20th century America - the Valentine's Day Massacre - where members of his gang gunned down seven of the rival Moran gang whilst dressed in police uniforms. The law finally caught up with the mob leader in 1931 when he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for tax evasion. He spent a majority of his sentence in the famous Alcatraz prison where he was famous for manipulating prison guards. His health deteriorated in prison and he was no longer capable to run 'The Chicago Outfit' upon his release. Suffering from neurosyphilis his mental health broke down and when examined a few years after his release he was said to have the mental capacity of a 12-year-old. Al Capone died in 1947 in Palm Island, Florida .","Steel armour weighing 3,000lbs and bulletproof windows to protect prohibition mob king .

Barbara Aqueveque (pictured) has been accused of a label-switching scam which saw her buy expensive children's toys for a fraction of the price and then selling them for huge profits on eBay . A mother has been accused of making up to $30,000 a month in a label-switching scam which enabled her to buy hundreds of children's toys at a fraction of the price. Barbara Aqueveque allegedly swapped the UPC bar codes of expensive products for cheaper ones so the wrong price would register at the check-out. She then sold her ill-gotten gains on eBay for huge profits. Police in Lauderhill, Florida, believe the 34-year-old pulled off the con for up to 18 months, hitting three to four Target or Walmart stores a day. She would invest about $80 each day to buy the items, but would make around $1,000 selling them online. Lauderhill . Police Detective Alex Iwaskewycz said: 'She had a store on eBay and . then the funds would be transferred through PayPal and then directly . into her checking account. 'She used the same debit card in every transaction she completed in all the Targets, and as you can see, every item is $6.99.' Iwaskewycz told 7News there were some months when she had $30,000 entering her account.

Duped: When Aqueveque gets to the checkout, the scanner registers the wrong bar code and she is able to walk off with the toy for a fraction of the cost . She was then seen buying the item at the checkout, where the scanner registers the wrong bar code and she is able to walk off with the toy for the reduced price. In one instance, her son tries to buy something he wanted, but she refuses as it did not have an altered label. Some . of the toys included original Lego kits, Star Wars Millennium Falcon . Lego kits and Queen Anne's Revenge Lego kits, all of which retail . between $100 to $150 each, Iwaskewycz said.

As fury grows over a report that Joe Paterno helped to cover up child sex abuse claims against Jerry Sandusky, one company is going above and beyond to make sure a statue of the late Penn State football coach is no more. A plane was spotted over State College on Wednesday towing a banner that read 'TAKE THE STATUE DOWN OR WE WILL.' The banner referred to a monument to Paterno, who coached the team for nearly 50 years before he was fired in disgrace last year at the height of the sex abuse scandal. Demands: The banner referred to a monument to Paterno, who coached the team for nearly 50 years before he was fired in disgrace last year . Taking flight: The banner appeared over the State College on Wednesday, as furor grows over Paterno's role in covering up the Sandusky scandal . The bronze sculpture bearing Paterno's likeness has been sitting in front of Beaver Stadium since 2001. The Centre Daily Times reported that the company that operates the plane, Air America Aerial Ads, is no stranger to controversial messages. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded a plane from the Genoa, Ohio-based company after it towed banners taunting Tiger Woods during the 2010 Masters golf tournament. Those banners read: 'Tiger: Did you mean Bootyism? (in reference to the golfer's claim that he was turning to Buddhism to help him get through his cheating scandal)' and 'Sex addict? Yeah. Right. Sure. Me too' Statue: The bronze sculpture bearing Paterno's likeness has been sitting in front of Beaver Stadium since 2001 . James Miller, who said he was the one flying the plane, would not name the person or group who funded the ad, telling the paper: 'I advertise. I believe in freedom of speech.' Penn State spokeswoman Lisa Powers told the Centre Daily Times that the university was aware of the high-flying banner, but were powerless to stop it. Ms Powers told the paper: 'Any restrictions would, of course, have to come from the [FAA]. There's not much action we can take related to this expression of opinion, but we are monitoring it.' An independent investigation led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh . released a report last week that concluded Paterno and other top Penn . State officials hid Sandusky's abuse to shield the university . from bad publicity. Paterno died of lung cancer on . January 22, less than three months before he was dismissed from the Penn . State sidelines for good. The new revelations about Paterno . have led to intense public backlash against the former coach, whose . firing was once widely thought to be unfair. Also on Tuesday, the group that runs the parking area dubbed 'Paternoville' where students camp out for tickets before games has stripped that title and changed the name to 'Nittanyville.' The Penn State student group that . manages the newly-renamed fan area said that their decision would help . ‘return the focus to the overall team and the thousands of students who . support it.' On its . website, they chose to remain diplomatic in their reasoning, saying that . 'since it was unlikely another coach would stay as long as Coach . Paterno had, changing the name for each new coach would be impractical.' The most significant change, however, may be yet to come as the president of the NCAA says he isn't ruling out the possibility of shutting down the entire Penn State football programme in light of the Sandusky case. Getting rid of all traces: Since a scathing report which detailed how much former football coach Joe Paterno (pictured) knew about the child sex scandal, his name is being pulled from much of the school . In a PBS interview on Monday night, NCAA President Mark Emmert said he doesn't want to 'take anything off the table' if the NCAA determines penalties against Penn State are warranted. Mr Emmert said he's 'never seen anything as egregious as this in terms of just overall conduct and behaviour inside a university.' He added, 'What the appropriate penalties are, if there are determinations of violations, we'll have to decide.' The last time the NCAA shut down a . football program with the so-called 'death penalty' was in the 1980s, . when SMU was forced to drop the sport because of extra benefits . violations. Legacy: Paterno was heralded around the campus for years, but now the NCAA is debating shutting down the football program entirely in the wake of the report . After the NCAA suspended the SMU program for a year, the school decided not to play in 1988, either, as it tried to regroup. 'This . is completely different than an impermissible benefits scandal like [what] happened at SMU, or anything else we've dealt with. This is as . systemic a cultural problem as it is a football problem,' Mr Emmert . said. 'There have been people that said this wasn't a football scandal. Well, it was more than a football scandal, much more than a football scandal. It was that but much more. 'We'll have to figure out exactly what the right penalties are. I don't know that past precedent makes particularly good sense in this case, because it's really an unprecedented problem.'","Plane seen flying over Penn State campus pulled a sign calling for the removal of monument to Paterno, who was fired in November .

Putting a brave face on things: Spectators at the Olympic Stadium jeered when it was announced Home Secretary Theresa May would be presenting some medals . Mr Osborne initially laughed as the jeering at the 80,000 seater Olympic Stadium erupted but seemed to become embarrassed as it continued. It appears spectators at the London 2012 Games are determined to deliver their verdict on the Coalition government with Prime Minister David Cameron also meeting a less than enthusiastic reception at the Aquatics Centre on Sunday. While Mr Cameron presented Ellie Simmonds with her gold medal some members of the crowd booed the PM but they were drowned out by cheers for the Paralympic poster girl.

South Africa has made an official complaint that athletes are switching the size of their running blades after Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius claimed longer prosthetics gave a rival an unfair advantage. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) received a letter yesterday morning alleging that athletes had changed the length of their blades, breaking competition rules. Staff spoke to coaches in the athletes' village yesterday but found no evidence to back the South African claims. Controversy: South Africa's Oscar Pistorius with his silver medal, left, after losing to Alan Fonteles Cardoso Oliveira, right, in the Men's 200m - T44 . Pistorius sparked controversy with angry comments he made after losing out on gold in the 200 metres. He alleged that Alan Fonteles Cardoso Oliveira's use of longer blades gave him an unfair advantage. Today, Craig Spence from the IPC said: 'When we put that allegation to the coaches there was a look of shock to be honest because running on different size prostheses or swapping them for races is extremely difficult to do for an athlete. 'There is no evidence that any athlete competed on different size running blades. 'Unless the South Africans can come to us with some evidence that proves otherwise, it's something that we won't continue investigating.' He said that blades were measured before the heats and the final, and that running on different size prostheses would involving adapting to a different running technique. The letter from the chief executive of the South African national Paralympic committee asked the IPC to 'urgently' investigate its allegation. It also asked to meet with members of the committee to discuss the existing rules. As things stand, it is against the rules to swap blades mid-competition, Mr Spence said. Organisers contacted competitors in April asking them to raise any concerns about Paralympic regulations, and they heard nothing from South Africa, he added. LOCOG chairman Sebastian Coe said Pistorius had spoken out 'in the heat of the moment'. He said: 'In sport we've all been in a mixed zone 40 or 50 seconds after a big emotional moment in your career and said all sorts of things. 'It's the nature of sport at the highest level. We shouldn't be surprised that from time to time emotions run high. 'As far as Oscar is concerned he's raised those concerns, he was very clear yesterday morning I think in trimming what he said in the heat of the moment.'

Former Labour MP Claire Ward claims the News of the World may have contributed to the loss of her baby because of the stress it caused after ‘threatening’ to publish a story about her. The politician, one of the original Blair’s babes, says she received a call from the newspaper in December 2004, the same time that private investigator Glenn Mulcaire was trying to access her voicemail. She was pregnant at the time and holidaying over the new year with her husband in Latvia, she said in a submission to the Leveson inquiry. The 40-year-old ex-MP does not say what the paper threatened to publish but said ‘this stress while we were away had an impact on my health. ‘I was under enormous stress from this threat. Following the general election in May 2005, my baby was stillborn. ‘I cannot help but think that the stress I was placed under in the early stages of my pregnancy, particularly during my stay in Riga, may have contributed to the eventual loss of my baby.’ The former MP for Watford said she believed newspapers have a right to hold politicians to account but that she suffered ‘intense and repeated interest’ in her personal life.

Damning: Professor Frank Furedi co-authored the report which suggests we should stop complaining so much . An American-style compensation culture is bleeding the NHS and schools dry, a leading academic warns today. Some teachers have become so scared of litigation that class ‘trips’ consist of simply taking pupils out into their own playgrounds, says Professor Frank Furedi. His devastating analysis blames a toxic combination of ambulance-chasing  lawyers and growing damages claims which are costing taxpayers billions. Doctors and teachers are routinely expected to ‘tick boxes’ to follow health and safety rules even at the expense of what is actually best for patients and pupils, he argues. This has led to excessive risk-aversion in schools, which ban playground games or restrict school trips, claims Prof Furedi, emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Kent. Settlements include £3,000 for a pupil suffering cuts from rose bushes and £30,000 for a pupil injured falling off a bench. Risky? The complaints culture in Britain is making teachers so scared of litigation that they take school trips in the playground . However, some teachers are also cashing in by taking legal action themselves, he adds in his book The Social Cost Of Litigation. Around £6.7million was paid out by councils in 2010 to employees who sued over injuries picked up at work, says Prof Furedi, whose work was commissioned by the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank. He adds that compensation demands were no longer seen as selfish acts by ‘have-a-go’ parents but as responsible action to stop other children having similar accidents. He says claims against the NHS are rising, along with defensive practices aimed at avoiding litigation. Claims were ‘perceived not only as a commonsense way of gaining financial compensation, but as a way of holding public services to account’, he says, adding: ‘But the combination of an engrained compensation culture and litigation avoidance is bleeding health and education dry: both financially, and in terms of their public sector ethos and professional role.’ Report claims that the complaints culture is costing our hospitals and schools in the long run . The NHS Litigation Authority estimates the cost of potential negligence claims at £16.6billion. However, of the 63,800 claims for medical negligence made since 2001, only about 2,000 have had damages set by a court. Another 28,700 were settled out of court. ‘Suing a publicly funded institution such as the NHS amounts to a spectacular own goal for citizens,’ said Prof Furedi. ‘The fear of litigation erodes professional autonomy, stifles innovation, leads to defensive practices and encourages bureaucracy. ‘If we want to put a brake on the culture of litigation and litigation avoidance in Britain, we need to look beyond ambulance-chasers and greedy lawyers to the cultural conditions that have allowed litigious sentiments to flourish as common sense.’ Tim Knox, director of the Centre for Policy Studies, believes professionals aren't always offering what's best for their pupils or patients . Tim Knox, director of the Centre for Policy Studies, said ‘This rise in the compensation culture has huge – if largely hidden – costs. In particular, it has created a climate in which professionals will prioritise litigation avoidance above what is best for their pupils or patients. ‘So many schools have reduced the extra-curricular activities that enrich children’s experience while at school, from school trips to outdoor play, while doctors are incentivised to follow “best practice” rather than follow their professional judgment.’","Report claims that complaints against doctors and teachers reduces the quality of service .

The world's largest airline food caterer, which employs thousands of people in Britain, is today at the centre of an FBI investigation into how needles found their way into turkey sandwiches on four international flights. Gate Gourmet, which provides meals for more than 20 airlines including all long-haul British Airways flights from Heathrow, distributed the sandwiches that contained what appeared to be small sewing needles. The needles were discovered in six sandwiches on four U.S.-bound Delta Air Lines planes that departed Amsterdam's t on Sunday. One passenger on a flight to Minneapolis was injured, but refused medical attention, a Delta spokesman said. The other needles were on two flights to Atlanta and one to Seattle. Scroll down for video . Lurking in the turkey: Catering firm Gate Gourmet, which provides meals for 14 airlines including all long-haul British Airways flights from Heathrow, distributed six sandwiches that contained small sewing needles. They were found aboard six U.S.-bound flights out of Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on Sunday . Gate Gourmet prepares over 200million meals a year from its 130 flight kitchens in 35 countries around the world. It services more than 20 airlines . including Delta Air Lines, British Airways, American Airlines, United . Airlines, Qantas Airways, Air France, Emirates Airline,  Amtrak and . EasyJet. The firm employs more than 22,000 people worldwide. In the UK, British Airways is Gate Gourmet's largest customer. In 2005, the caterer sacked 670 staff - mainly Asian women - from its airline meals service in a dispute over restructuring at Heathrow. It lost £25million at its operation at the airport the year before, and maintained that changes in working practices were needed. In August of that year, a two-day wildcat action by British Airways ground staff at Heathrow stopped all the airline's flights leaving the airport. The strike, in support of the Gate Gourmet workers, stranded more than 100,000 passengers and cost the airline an estimated £40million ($72million). It also left BA unable to provide normal in-flight meals once services resumed, with many passengers instead being given vouchers with which to buy their food from the airport. After the BA staff had returned to work, the stand-off at Gate Gourmet rumbled on, with the sacked staff picketing outside the caterer's Heathrow factory. To try to end the dispute, at the end of August Gate Gourmet offered all staff - including those that had been sacked - redundancy packages. About 700 staff - 300 of those sacked and 400 from the existing Gate Gourmet employees - applied to accept the offer. The FBI has opened a criminal investigation into the matter. Gate Gourmet prepares more than 200million meals a year from its 130 flight kitchens in 35 countries. Spokesman Christina . Ulosevich said the caterer is cooperating . fully with investigators and has received no reports of similar incidents on . any of the other airlines it serves out of Amsterdam. She said the company did not yet know how the needles got into the sandwiches but declined to comment further,  saying 'details of this matter must remain confidential'. Gate . Gourmet issued a statement saying: 'We take this matter very seriously, . and we have launched our own full-scale investigation.' It also said it is 'heightening our already stringent safety and security procedures, to prevent any recurrence'. The . sandwiches were made in the Gate Gourmet's Amsterdam kitchen, and were to be served to business class passengers on Delta . flights out of Schiphol Airport. After the needles were found, passengers got pizza instead. Kristin Baur, a spokesman for Delta, said the airline has boosted . security for its meal production and is using more pre-packaged food . while the probe continues. In . a statement to MailOnline, the airline said: 'Delta is taking this . matter extremely seriously and is cooperating with local and federal . authorities who are investigating the incident.

'Delta . requires all its in-flight caterers to adhere to strict criteria in . order to offer our customers the very best onboard meals. The safety and . security of our passengers and crew is Delta's number one priority.' The needle incident is the latest in a series of troubles for the airline this month. Last week, a 'pressurisation issue' forced a jet travelling from Detroit to Washington, D.C., to declare an emergency.

Tragedy: Jay Whiston, 17, from Clacton, Essex, died after being stabbed during a house party in Colchester . The 'old fashioned' parents who allowed their daughter to hold a party which led to the murder of a teenager have said they took 'every precaution possible' to keep the event under control. Paul and Jeanette Gathercole, who call themselves 'fuddy duddy', allowed their daughter, Laura, to hold the party to mark the start of her GCSE year at a respected Colchester school. But the parents were left stunned when their carefully controlled event - which their daughter had advertised on Facebook under a private invite setting - spiralled out of control. It ended in tragedy as 17-year-old Jay Whiston was stabbed to death just yards from their house. Mr and Mrs Gathercole, who have lived at the property in a leafy suburb for 21 years, supervised the proceedings and even went as far as to place hazard tape around their garden and marked out steps so no one would fall over. Mrs Gathercole said: 'We took every precaution we possibly could to make sure it was a safe party. 'We are quite old-fashioned parents, quite fuddy-duddy. 'We really did to everything by the book - the party started at 7.30pm and we had soft drink and food there. 'We were supervising it the whole time and patrolled the conservatory and kitchen and the parts of the garden where the children were allowed to go. 'The rest of the house was marked off with hazard tape - we put tape around the slabs in the garden so no-one would hurt themselves.' Mr Gathercole, who works at an Audi dealership in Chelmsford, said everything had been under tight control but at 9.30pm they had stopped one youngster that Laura did not know from entering the party. Within 20 minutes Jay had been stabbed in the stomach with a single blow that killed him. Mr Gathercole said: 'We did not see what happened as the first we knew of it was when the paramedics arrived.

The family said about 100 teens had attended the party, which Laura had set up through Facebook using a private invite setting. Their daughter Laura had sent out . notes to neighbours warning them that she was throwing a party and . apologising for any noise in advance. She insisted her Facebook page had specifically been created so strangers could not access the details. She said: 'I had a private page which could only be accessed by invited people - it was not a public Facebook page. 'The guests were allowed to bring a 'plus one' but they had to ask first.' Laura said she did not know Jay, who lived in Clacton, but said he had come with a friend of hers.

The teen said most of the invites had . gone out to fellow pupils at Colchester County High School for Girls, an . institution which is renowned for achieving some of the best GCSE and A-level results nationally. Other invites were sent to pals from the nearby St Benedict’s College and Philip Morant School. Mrs Gathercole said her family had been left feeling numb following the killing on Saturday night. She said: 'We are devastated and our thoughts are with Jay’s family. 'We would like to express our sincere condolences to them.

Mrs Shearer, a full-time foster carer . from Clacton, Essex, added: ‘It’s typical of politicians.

Mrs Shearer broke down in tears as . she told ITV’s Daybreak how she fussed over Jay before he went to the . party, insisting he had some pizza so he would not leave on an empty . stomach. Describing the last moment she saw him, she said: ‘I kissed him. That was it. The last time.’ She added: ‘This can’t go on. Parents . have to take more responsibility of knowing where their children are.

But now the veteran film reviewer is facing some critics of his own. Readers have taken him to task over his weekly film review column in the Radio Times, saying it is sexist, misogynistic and stuck in the past. They pointed to his recent review of 1990 movie Pretty Woman in which he described Julia Roberts’s character as an ‘archetypal tart with a heart’ and ‘every man’s dream hooker’. And why not? Barry Norman, pictured here presenting one of his famous film review programmes, insisted he was merely describing how the movie depicted women . But Norman, 79, insisted he was merely describing how the movie depicted women rather than expressing his own views. ‘God Almighty, what is the matter with these people?’ he said. In the Pretty Woman review he wrote:  ‘Nowadays this arouses the tut-tut of disapproval for its sexism and rose-tinted view of prostitution (as personified by every man’s dream hooker, Julia Roberts). ‘Richard Gere (every girl’s dream billionaire) is the businessman who picks her up in Hollywood and hires her for a week, partly for sex but mostly as arm candy to be worn at dinners and polo matches... ‘Roberts, of course, has been driven to the streets by harsh circumstances and is really the archetypal tart with a heart while Gere is not nearly so ruthless as he first appears. Charm: Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman . ‘Suspend disapproval and enjoy because it’s made and played with a great deal of charm.’ In another review Norman appeared to suggest women liked James Bond because of the spy’s ruthless approach to love. He wrote: ‘For a young man, what was not to like? We all wanted to be James Bond. And somehow, despite – or who knows, possibly because of – his cavalier and occasionally cruel treatment of their sex, women seemed to like him, too.’ In another review he described Marilyn Monroe’s 1953 classic movie How To Marry a Millionaire, saying: ‘It’s all very sexist (Women’s Lib hadn’t been invented then) but it’s amusing enough.’ In another, he referred to Julie Walters’s character in the 1983 movie Educating Rita as a ‘tarty working-class student’. Reader Jackie Grant, from Oxford, complained that Norman had made ‘four sexist remarks in just a few lines’, adding: ‘I’m tired of reading the misogynist (sic) comments Barry Norman injects into so many film reviews.’ Outspoken headmistress Dr Helen Wright, from St Mary’s Calne in Wiltshire, said Norman should take more care not to repeat negative stereotypes of women. Miss Wright, whose targets have included X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos for a foul-mouthed rant on Twitter, said the world had moved on and Norman should too. ‘While he is writing about films from a more sexist era, he should be careful not to suggest they are reminiscent of a glorious golden age,’ she said. ‘By repeating sexist phrases, you help reinforce sexist views. ‘Mr Norman is a witty and acerbic writer. Someone with that power of language needs to be careful not to reinforce outmoded ways of thinking. The world has moved on from the days when it is OK to describe a woman as a “tart with a heart”, and he needs to move on too.’ However, Mr Norman was scathing in his defence. ‘God Almighty, what is the matter with these people?,’ he said. ‘I was merely describing in shorthand how these films depict women, not advancing my own views. If people don’t have the intelligence to see that, it is not my fault. I’m not old fashioned. ‘These are phrases that have been used for years, and are still used now. I think political correctness can be very important, but it does go overboard sometimes. It is possible to be too prickly, possibly a little humourless about things.’","Readers have taken the veteran film reviewer to task over his column in the Radio Times .

Comrades of missing sailor Timmy MacColl left a space on deck where he should have stood as their ship returned to port in the UK yesterday. The 27-year-old father-of-two, originally from Killin, Scotland, vanished on a night out socialising when the ship was docked in Dubai more than 12 weeks ago. Despite a large media campaign in the Emirate, there has not been an update on the case from Dubai police for weeks. It is feared he may have been kidnapped. Touching tribute: A space is left on deck where missing Leading Seaman Timmy MacColl should have been standing as HMS Westminster returns to port in Southampton yesterday morning . There were tears yesterday as sailors lined the deck of HMS Westminster as it arrived at Portsmouth. In tribute to their missing comrade the ship's company left a space where he should have been standing. On land, the family of Leading Seaman MacColl stood at the shoreline as the vessel made its way to dock at 10am, unfurling a banner that read, simply: 'Bring Timmy Home'. Leading Seaman MacColl’s pregnant wife Rachael, 25, watched the ship arrive from the privacy of the dockyard. The return comes as an anonymous benefactor put up a 'substantial cash reward' for any information . Missing: Timothy MacColl, 27, from Gosport in Hampshire, with one of his two children. He vanished more than 12 weeks ago . Mrs MacColl - who married her husband . seven years ago after they met at HMS Collingwood - hopes the reward . will lead to a development in the case. 'The . reward will be paid if information given actually leads to Timmy being . physically located,' she said. 'If someone knows something please come . forward. 'My life can’t move . forward until I find him. It’s not just emotionally, it’s financially, . my children, his family. Our family deserves answers. That’s the main . thing, we just need to find him.' Timmy went missing after being put into a taxi by two shipmates outside the Rock Bottom Cafe nightclub at 2am on May 27. He had no ID and only a Nokia phone, which has never been found. The cab was told to go back to Port Rashid where Westminster was docked, but the sailor never arrived. The . driver has told Dubai police the sailor got out of the car when he got . lost inside the port and pulled over to ask for directions. Mrs . MacColl, who is expecting their third child in October, made a trip to . Dubai and retraced her husband’s last-known steps last month. She fears he has been kidnapped. Land and sea searches around Port Rashid failed to find any clues. 'We are told Timmy gets in the taxi, he gets out of the taxi at the tea shack and that’s it,' she said. 'We’ve . not been told how they know this information is true. And we’ve not . been told about forensics on the vehicle or anything like that, so we . don’t even know if it was Timmy in the taxi. 'It’s . assumed it was Timmy in the cab. It has been ascertained now that there . were other members of the ship’s company in Rock Bottom. 'They would have left at some point and got a taxi back. There’s nothing after he is seen on CCTV leaving the bar. 'The . description of his clothing given to the police by shipmates was wrong, . he was wearing blue and white checked shorts with a red T-shirt and . dark-blue canvas shoes.' Mixed emotions: Friends and relatives of Timmy lined the shoreline to . release yellow balloons and unfurled a banner as the ship returned to its . home port of Portsmouth, Hampshire . Difficult time: Timmy's friends and family hug as HMS Westminster returns to Portsmouth. They are calling on the British police to become involved in the search after hearing nothing from the Dubai police for weeks . Tearful crowds shouted 'Welcome home . Westminster' as the ship passed yesterday and 50 yellow balloons were . released in tribute to the missing sailor. The Captain of HMS Westminster said he was 'desperately disappointed' to be returning home without Leading Seaman MacColl. Mrs . MacColl's uncle Neil Cunningham - who flew out to Dubai to help with . the search in June - joined her mother, aunt and grandfather yesterday . at Portsmouth's Round Tower fort to watch the Westminster's arrival. He said: 'Not knowing what happened to Timmy has been hard for Rachael but she has been amazingly strong and resilient. 'She has shown immense strength of character and will never give up searching for him. 'Outwardly . she displays such strong emotions. When she is with people she is fine - . she has the comfort and support of family and a good network of . friends. 'But when she is alone with the children - particularly early in the morning - things are more difficult. 'We will go on searching for Timmy forever.' Family man: His wife Rachael, who is expecting their third child in . October, has vowed to find her husband . Mr . Cunningham, 42, added: 'We are also here to support the ship’s company . who have gone through the same awful 77 days as us, missing a ship . mate.' Mrs MacColl’s . grandfather Jim Cunningham said: 'It has been a very, very fraught time . for us. We never realised it was going to continue for this long without . a positive outcome. 'I have . wanted Hampshire Constabulary to be involved in this case from the . start. They have experience of dealing with other forces and a good . track record with murder enquiries.' Mrs MacColl’s mother Jacqui Brien also vowed to never give up hope. But she said the couple’s son Cameron, seven, and daughter Skye, four, are struggling to understand what’s going on. Cameron thinks his dad has been kidnapped - 'like in the film Pirates of the Caribbean'. Mrs Brien, 46, added: 'Someone knows something. Whatever has happened we need to find Timmy or we’ll always be wondering. 'We have shed more tears this last week than any other - I think it was knowing the ship was coming back without Timmy. 'The closer my daughter gets to her due date the harder it gets. It is really hard for her. We feel empty and numb.' Departed: Routine checks were carried out by the Navy before the HMS Westminster sailed, but they could not locate the leading seaman and local authorities were alerted . Concerning: The sailor, right, has not been seen since getting into a taxi at around 2am on May 27. It is known that he had just left the Rock Bottom Bar, left, which is at the Regent Hotel in the area of Deira . Neil . Cunningham said the family is struggling to gather information and . added: 'I keep trying to get the Dubai police to speak to me but they . won’t unless I’m out there in person. 'I’m . requesting information from the home secretary and speaking to the . Royal Navy’s investigation branch, which is doing a sterling job in very . trying circumstances.' The Royal Navy has continued to express its 'concern' for Timmy’s safety. A . spokesman said: 'The matter is being treated as a missing person case. The MoD and Royal Navy continue to liaise with and provide assistance to . the Dubai authorities. 'The Foreign Office also remains in contact with the Emirati police about their ongoing investigation.' Captain . Nick Hine, Leading Seaman MacColl's commanding officer, said: 'Clearly . we are all desperately disappointed that Leading Seaman MacColl remains . missing.

For most of her life Kerry Elia was self-conscious about her body; she hated her flat 34A chest and longed to be curvy and shapely like other women she knew. So, after years of saving to pay for the cosmetic surgery she was desperate for, the mother-f-four was delighted with the results of the procedure that left her with the body she'd longed for. For the first time ever she had boobs she loved and she finally felt like the woman she’d always wanted to be. But her joy soon turned to despair as the breast implants she had paid £3,750 for began slowly killing her. Kerry at home over Christmas in 2009. It was one of the last pictures taken of her before she died. Her heart failed following TB treatment . Kerry before and after her operation: She was delighted with her larger breasts but came to regret having the surgery . Now, the four children she left . behind – Shannon, 21, Joe, 19, Lloyd, 15, and six-year-old Madison – . wish she had never gone for surgery. Shannon . said: 'Mum was happiest after she had her boob job. She loved feeling . womanly and curvy and it made her really confident. But before long she . fell ill and never recovered. 'Mum suffered for years after having the operation and she regretted having it done. 'She even had a mastectomy but it was too late by then. She wanted other women to know it wasn’t worth it.' Shannon was eight when Kerry, from Eltham, South East London, had saved enough for a breast enlargement. Kerry’s mother Linda, 61, remembers the day in 1999 her daughter called to tell her she was going ahead with the operation. 'My . heart sank,' recalls Linda. 'But I knew it was something she had wanted . since she was a teenager and she’d been saving for years.' Kerry’s operation in London transformed her into a curvy 34C and she was delighted with the results. Linda remembers her being so happy she cried. 'She said she felt like a real woman at last and her confidence blossomed. She had a photo shoot done and it was the first time she had ever liked a picture of herself,' she added. Kerry Elia (left) when she was in hospital just before she died. Right - with her daughter Shannon when she was little . Kerry with her daughter Shannon who said that in the end her mother knew her breast implants hadn't been worth it . Two years after the operation, Kerry . met her husband-to-be, security guard Darren. But 18 months later, she . developed a cough and a chest X-ray revealed she had tuberculosis, a . serious lung infection. Doctors were not sure how she’d . caught it, but one theory was the disease had laid dormant in her body . until the implants were inserted. Linda . explains: 'We were all worried, but Kerry told us not to be. She took . it in her stride and said the medication would clear it up. None of us . thought for a minute it would end up killing her.' The cough did clear up and Kerry and Darren started planning their wedding with Shannon due to be a bridesmaid. But one morning, Kerry called Linda distraught saying that her implant had just exploded. 'She . was on her way to work when she felt a pop in her chest and then blood . and fluid had started seeping out of an open wound on her breast. 'I told her to drive straight to hospital.' Missing mum: Shannon today with her grandmother Linda (right). They said Kerry's breasts robbed her of so much. Left - a poem Shannon read at her mother's funeral . Tuberculosis is primarily a disease of the lungs that can spread to other organs and can be fatal if left untreated. About 90 per cent of people who get infected with TB develop a latent TB infection, which means the infecting bacteria are alive in the body, but inactive. People who have latent infections do not have TB symptoms and cannot spread the infection to others. However, about five per cent of latent TB become active TB in the first year, and about five to 15 per cent after that. TB becomes latent when an infected person’s immune system isn't strong enough to keep the infectious bacteria in check. It breaks out of walled off lesions known as 'tubercles' that can survive for decades. This could explain why Kerry's TB emerged about her breast surgery. In the last 20 years TB cases have gradually increased in the UK, particularly among ethnic minority communities originally from places where TB is widespread. Source: http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tuberculosis/ . It was bad news. The TB infection was back and it had eaten away at the scar tissue, causing the implant to burst. The risk of infection was serious and Kerry was told to have the implants taken out. Call-centre worker Shannon recalls: . 'Mum tried so hard to smile on her wedding day but she kept crossing her . arms because the dress no longer fitted her chest and it was gaping . open.' After the . operation, Kerry’s confidence crumbled and she admitted she felt like a . freak without her implants. Finally, a year later, she got the all-clear . to have them replaced. 'I remember Mum laughing and joking and letting us all have a squeeze because she had her boobs back,' says Shannon. 'She was over the moon and said everything would get back to normal now.' Only it wasn’t to be because just a . few months after the second operation, accounts worker Kerry’s other . boob popped open and the implants had to be removed for a second time. This time she was left with scarring across both boobs and an open wound on her right. Tests . also revealed the devastating news that Kerry had caught MRSA while she . was in hospital. It meant yet more medication but, finally, Kerry beat . it and she decided to have another baby with Darren. Family tragedy: Kerry Elia pictured with her youngest daughter Madison (left) her mother Linda and daughters Shannon and Lorraine . Funeral: Kerry Elia who died after a series of complications which was triggered by her boob job . Baby Madison was born in June 2005 and Kerry was advised it was safe to breast-feed her. But . within a matter of months their happiness was destroyed when doctors . told Kerry that the TB had returned and then discovered a lump in her . breast. Shannon says: 'At first we feared cancer but tests showed that it was scar tissue from all of the breast operations that was turning septic. 'It meant that Mum might end up getting blood poisoning and die.' Kerry was advised to have her left breast completely removed but, instead, she begged surgeons to remove them both. Linda explains: 'She’d been through so much by then she didn’t care anymore. She wanted them gone so she could get well again and get back to being a good wife and mum.” Kerry in her late teens: She was never happy with her flat-chest . The following week, Kerry had a . double mastectomy. 'It was a big operation but she still hadn’t lost her . sense of humour,' says Shannon. Before she went home, the hospital gave Kerry a specially made mastectomy bra with built-in pads to look like breasts. 'She had us in stitches when she would ask one of us to ‘go and get my boobs’,' says Shannon. 'Sometimes my little sister would put the pads on, which made us all laugh.' Little Maddy was just three when . Kerry started coughing again and her family feared the TB was back. She . had tubes fitted into her chest to pump in medication but it didn’t seem . to help and tests showed that she had grown resistant to all the drugs. Doctors were left with just one option: to remove part of her lung. Linda recalls: 'I went in with her to . hospital the night before the operation and lay on the bed with her . eating sweets and watching TV. 'She turned to me and asked if she was going to be OK and it was the first time I’d ever seen her look scared. 'Of course you will’, I told her. ‘You always are’.' Five days after the operation Kerry was allowed home. The procedure appeared to have been a success. But a month on, Kerry started bleeding during the night and Darren quickly rushed her into hospital. For the first two nights she seemed . stable but on the third morning, January 12, 2010, Linda called and was . given the devastating news that Kerry had passed away. 'I was actually on my way to see her. I said they must have the wrong person. I dropped the phone and thought I was going to collapse,' she says. Linda asked Kerry’s sister to go to . Shannon’s office and break the news. At the hospital, the family was . told Kerry had died of internal bleeding. An artery in her heart had . collapsed under the stress.She was only 40 and her body just couldn’t take it any more. Shannon made sure her mother's fake breasts were in her coffin when she was cremated. 'She never went anywhere without them so I know she would have liked that,' she says. 'Mum . never really blamed her boobs for all that happened to her, even though . her health only went downhill after she had the chest implants. 'They made her so happy, but in the end she knew it wasn’t worth it. Her boobs robbed her of so much. 'But they also robbed us of the most loveliest mum we could have wished for and we miss her. 'Mum wanted bigger boobs but they killed her – we’d do anything to have her back the way she was.'For more information about issues surrounding TB visit www.TBalert.org and if you would like to make a donation to the charity please visit Kerry’s just giving page at www.justgiving.com/Kerry-Elia/ .","'Mum wanted other women to know that breast enlargements aren't worth it'

And its owner Roger Dyball, who at 74 is more than 25 years younger than the bulb burning brightly in his porch, says it looks as though the light will keep on going. 'It's absolutely brilliant - and, at this rate, it will burn for ever,' he said. Proud: 74-year-old Roger Dyball pictured with the 100-year-old lightbulb in his porch . Mr Dyball and his wife Patricia, also 74, have lived in their family home in Lowestoft, West Suffolk for 45 years and believe the bulb was already in place well before they moved in. He said: 'We have been here since 1967 and the fitting was here when we arrived. 'We have just left it there with all its original fittings and it has never gone out.' Roger said he knows so much about the history of the venerable bulb because it caught his eye shortly after he moved into the house. Careful now: Roger Dyball proudly displays the lightbulb that has lit up his porch in Lowestoft for 100 years . In an effort to find out more about it, he wrote to Osram-GEC's head office in London, including in his correspondence the serial number printed on the bulb. On January 30, 1968 the electrical goods giant replied to his highly unusual inquiry, telling him: 'From the numbers quoted in your letter we would estimate that this lamp was manufactured sometime in July 1912.' Century: The lightbulb in Lowestoft, West Suffolk has now gone for 100 'not out' this month . Delighted Roger framed the certification and put it up just a few feet away from his extra-special centenary lightbulb in the porch. The bulb was turned out at the Osram GEC Lampworks factory in Wembley, north-west London, as King George V sat on the throne. And the Great War was still two years away when it first started to shine. 'We think it must have been hand-made and I was quite impressed at the time that Osram actually got back to me - and that they had the records to go back that far,' said the keen gardener. Desperate to find out more about the lightbulb, fascinated Roger has also carried out some of his own research. 'In 1870, there were gas lights in the town, so with all the streets being dug up around 1912 this area must have had electricity laid within that first year,' he said . Roger, who used to work in the quality control department at Birds Eye in Lowestoft, said he believed the secret of the bulb's stunning long life lay in its robust design, which sets it apart from modern lightbulbs. 'It has a very thick filament, which is why it has not gone out at all,' he said. 'We continue to just use it despite people telling us time and again not to. Disposable: Roger says he believes his lightbulb has lasted so long due to its thick filament, which sets it apart from modern equivalents . 'I don't think it will ever go out!' The country's oldest working bulb surfaced in September 2008 when it was a magnificent 113 years old. Retired electrician Roy Fisher, 78, discovered the true treasure as he renovated the cellar of a house in Margate, Kent. Sotheby’s auction house estimated the bulb could have been made as early as 1895 - just 15 years after Thomas Edison first invented the light bulb in 1880.","The 230-volt bulb was made in Wembley, north-west London, as King George V sat on the throne .

A beauty queen who was stalked by an obsessed admirer for two years left court in tears after he was sent to prison today. Chloe Hopkins, 20, said Anthony Mantova, 34, made her life a misery after he began following her on crutches threatening: ‘Your tiara and sash would look good on my bedroom floor.’ He tattooed Chloe’s name across his chest and also wore a T shirt with her photograph on it. Not . only that but he attended her church, showered her with birthday, . Christmas and Valentine’s cards, posted comments about her on Facebook . and even turned up at her friend’s funeral. He . also went to gigs where Miss Hopkins – who was crowned Miss Prestatyn . 2010 – was singing and walked past her home on many occasions. Mr Mantova, 34, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, pleaded guilty to harassment and was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison. Miss Hopkins said: ‘Throughout the . harassment I have suffered at the hands of Anthony Mantova I have been . unable to answer the question as to what actually I have done to deserve . this.’ Mr Mantova wrote . lies about her on Facebook and when Miss Hopkins complained to police he . claimed she hated disabled people and wanted them all dead. Miss Hopkins said her ordeal had . ‘destroyed’ her relationship with her 52-year-old musician father, who . was powerless to do anything after he was warned by police not to . approach Mr Mantova. Miss Hopkins added: ‘I feel sick leaving the house now. Mum and dad have to go out and tell me whether it was clear or not. ‘For . the last few weeks every time I’ve gone into town I’ve been thinking, . ‘Is he going to come out from around a corner?’ Every time I heard a . crutch I’d would think, ‘Is that him behind me?’ ‘It . just feels to me like he’s lonely and wants attention. He asked me out . once and I said, ‘That’s sweet of you, but I’m just not ready for a . relationship at the moment. ‘I . want to focus on my music career.’ From that point on it was world war . three. He was saying I wanted all disabled people dead. That broke my . heart because I’m just not that kind of person.” Chloe Hopkins (right, black dress) arrives at Prestatyn Magistrates Court in North Wales for the sentencing of her stalker Anthony Mantova (pictured left) ‘I . remember his crutches clipping the pavement as he walked. Now I’m now . too distracted looking for Anthony instead of concentrating on my . performance.' Miss Hopkins was so traumatised by . his actions that she took an overdose of anti-depressants and constantly . listened out for the sound of Mr Mantova’s crutches ‘clipping the . pavement’. Miss Hopkins and . Mr Mantova met when she was out in a pub with four friends in 2010. She . noticed him sitting on his own and invited him to join them before . giving him a life home. This act of kindness led to Mr Mantova following Miss Hopkins around their seaside town and also Chester. Miss Hopkins befriended her stalker Mr Mantova when she was out with friends at and saw him sitting alone . While she was at a Miss Prestatyn event at a local cinema, Mr Mantova turned up and refused to leave until police arrived. He set up a “Where are you now?” internet account in Miss Hopkins’s . name and posted a public petition on Facebook : “Stop Chloe Hopkins of . Prestatyn.” Miss Hopkins said her ordeal had . ‘destroyed’ her relationship with her 52-year-old musician father, who . was powerless to do anything after he was warned by police not to . approach Mr Mantova.

North Wales Police issued a warning in late 2011 but Mr Mantova took no notice and continued to pester Chloe. Prosecutor Mr Matthew Ellis said: “He . posted sexually motivated comments on her Facebook page. He asked her . whether she would take his virginity and when she was Miss Prestatyn he . said that her tiara and sash would look good on her bedroom floor. ‘He . joined her church and could be seen walking past her home even though . he was never attending the church. The defendant had a tattoo with four . names in his chest. Chloe, Dan, Fran and Jamie. ‘He . would send Valentines and birthday cards to her. She told him that she . didn’t want to see him again but he posted love songs on Facebook and . “‘babe do you want something hard between your legs”. ‘He even used a picture of her from the Miss Prestatyn website and had it printed on a T-shirt. At a funeral he came and sat behind her and she unable to relax and pay her respects to her friend. ‘When he was arrested he said he did it as revenge for things that Chloe had done to him. He said he wanted to upset her because she was getting away with murder. ‘He said he would continue to harass her from prison unless she apologised to him. He said he wasn’t in love with or obsessed by her but he wanted others to see her for what she really is.’ Mr Mantova was also banned from contacting Miss Hopkins under a restraining order. The magistrates said his behaviour was ‘entirely unprovoked’ and caused ‘extreme stress and anxiety’. His lawyer Gwyn Jones said in mitigation: ‘He has to accept that these difficulties in early part of his life means that he doesn’t have the usual social skills that you would expect of a 34 year old. ‘They started out as friends however they fell out with what can only be regarded as a petty and infantile dispute.’","Stalker Anthony Mantova followed beauty queen Chloe Hopkins, who was crowned Miss Prestatyn 2010, around town on crutches .

A 42-year-old homeless man with a history of sexual violence including two previous sex attack charges on elderly women has been arrested in connection with the brutal rape of a 73-year-old birdwatcher in Central Park on Wednesday morning. David Albert Mitchell, a native of West Virginia who has spent most of his adult life in prison, was taken into custody last night by three police officers who spotted him walking on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, not far from where the woman said the attack occurred. The elderly victim picked Mitchell out of a lineup on Thursday, according to New York Police Department spokesman Paul Browne. He is expected to face rape charges. Scroll down for video . Alleged rapist: David Albert Mitchell, pictured, has been arrested in connection with the brutal rape of a 73-year-old birdwatcher in Central Park on Wednesday morning . The heavily tattooed suspect spat at . police officers as he was escorted in handcuffs out of a New York . police building yesterday afternoon. Yesterday afternoon police released surveillance footage showing a suspect making off with the victim's backpack. They have said Mitchell was the man shown in the video. Browne said the suspect had some of the victim's belongings on him, including the memory card from her camera when he was picked up by the officers. Mitchell's disturbing criminal . history began when he was 18, when he was charged with molesting and beating . to death 87-year-old Annie Parks during a burglary in Jenkinjones, his . hometown. A jury did not convict him, but . months later he was accused of raping a woman in her 70s during another . home invasion reported the Charleston Gazette. Mitchell pleaded guilty to first-degree robbery in that trial and was sentenced to 10 years in prison, of which he served eight. After his release, the suspect was . arrested twice more and then was convicted of kidnapping in 2003 and was . sent to prison to serve an eight-year sentence. Over the past two years he has been . hauled in by police for probation violations and petty crimes, but had . not served a significant stretch in prison before coming to New York. Mitchell's sister-in-law and . ex-girlfriend Saretta Mitchell told the Associated Press that she was . the victim in the 2003 kidnapping and that Mitchell attempted to . sexually assault her. She said that his crimes 'were always sexually driven.' Disgusting: The 42-year-old, pictured, spat as he was escorted out of the police building . Line up: The victim picked Mitchell, pictured, out of a line up today . The victim told investigators she . believed a previous encounter with the man, where she took a photograph . of him exposing himself, may have prompted the gruesome attack, which . left her bruised and battered. She said her attacker asked, 'Do you . remember me?' before pushing her to the ground and raping her 'vaginally . and rectally' at about 11am in a wooded area near the park's tranquil . Strawberry Fields. The area serves as a memorial to John Lennon. Mitchell is believed to have been wanted in another Central Park assault as well and has a long history of attacks on elderly women. In the horrific attack, the elderly . woman said she was thrown to the ground and sexually assaulted by the . man who then made off with her backpack, which contained her camera. He . also tried to steal her watch but was unsuccessful. Shaken up but mostly angry, the woman told The New York Post what punishment she believes her attacker deserves. 'Kill . him,' she said. 'Cut off his penis. That’s fine. Cut off his feet, then . hit him over the head. Then give him life in prison. Police: Officers, pictured, cordoned off the area in Strawberry Fields yesterday . Central Park: The victim said the man who attacked her in the wooded area of the park, pictured, had an eastern European accent . 'I’m . a little jittery. I get the shakes. But I’m more angry. I hope he goes . to jail for a long time, and he gets raped, over and over again.' The woman, who regularly visits the . park, said she thinks the assailant was the same man she photographed . masturbating about 10 days ago in another, more isolated spot known as . The Ramble. She said he demanded she delete the . image before they went their separate ways during their previous . encounter, and tried to grab her camera but didn't succeed. Police said . that initial encounter wasn't reported. In yesterday's meeting, the woman said the man approached her and asked if she remembered him. When she said no, he attacked. 'He . pounced on me,' she told The Post. 'He jumped on my back... I started . screaming. And he said, ‘You don’t scream!’ And he grabbed my throat.'I . still screamed. ‘He said, ‘I’ll cut your jugular!’ I stopped screaming. Mugshot: An undated mugshot shows David Albert Mitchell, who police have just arrested for brutally raping a 73-year-old woman . Fleeing: After he allegedly raped the woman, he grabbed her bag and fled our of the park to Manhattan's Upper West Side . Then 'he raped me — vaginally and rectally. Brutally,' she said. After the rape, the man repeated, . 'I’ll cut your jugular. He mashed my head into the dirt. He said, ‘You . stay there and count to 100.’ I counted to 100. 'This guy knew what he wanted to do. He wanted to beat the s--t out of me. I think he’s beaten women before.' Eric Ozawa, a college professor and birdwatcher, found the woman and called 911. He . told reporters he noticed a pair of legs sticking out along the path . but thought it was somebody sleeping. As he got closer, he realized it . was a woman lying face down. Her face was badly swollen, she had a black . eye, a broken eye socket and was covered in mulch. NYPD: Police, pictured at the crime scene, have released video footage of the suspected rapist . Witness: Eric Ozawa, pictured, a college professor and birdwatcher, found the woman and called 911 . Still, she appeared 'self-possessed and lucid,' Ozawa said. After the woman told Ozawa she had been mugged and raped, he immediately called the police. 'It's shocking that it could happen in the park in broad daylight,' he said. 'That someone could rape somebody in her 70s.' Investigators interviewed Ozawa on Wednesday, while other officers and detectives swarmed the scene in search of the suspect. Police blocked off much of the area . near West 72nd Street and Central Park West as they hunted for a suspect . described as a man in his 40s. The . victim told The Post he spoke with a eastern European accent that may . have been Russian. Mitchell is believed to have an accent although he is . not Russian, DNA Info reported. Dangerous: Passersby were shocked that such an attack happened in the middle of the day . Park patrons: Crowds of onlookers, pictured, watched as investigators searched for evidence in Central Park . Authorities yesterday released surveillance images of the suspect who was wearing black pants, a black T-shirt and white sneakers. He was carrying a backpack that resembled the one stolen from the woman, and also wearing a second backpack. Alexander Stein, 48, who runs a picture booth nearby, told DNA Info he saw a police officer near Strawberry Fields get the call about the crime and race over, followed moments later by more squad cars and an ambulance. 'Things happen here every day,' Stein told the news website. 'But when police start running in every direction and ambulances come, you know something serious has happened.' Emily Loubaton, 29, was in the park on a scavenger hunt that her company had organized. 'I think this is pretty disgusting, and so shocking it would happen on such a beautiful day in such a beautiful park,' she said. Scene: The attack took place in a popular area of the park dedicated to John Lennon . Asked if she felt less safe in Central . Park, she said: 'I'd like to believe that New York City has turned the . corner for the better. I mean, this isn't the 70s. But it definitely . makes you pause before you walk in.' The victim told The Post that she wasn't frightened to return to Central Park and would not let the attacker stop her enjoying the area. 'I’m not scared. I don’t want to lose that pleasure. I won’t let anything keep me from enjoying the park,' she said. 'I’m not going back looking like this, but of course I’ll go back. It’s my park. I look like hell, but it will heal. I can see I’m alive.' But she admitted she may lose some sleep after the horrific attack. 'I know tonight, I will have a little trouble. I’ll feel the weight of him pushing me to the ground, and pummel, pummel, pummel,' she told the newspaper, punching the air around her.","David Albert Mitchell, 42, likely to be charged with rape after broad daylight rape yesterday .

The Olympic row between the U.S. and China rolled on today as the personal details of the American swimming coach who questioned the gold-medal success of Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen were shared with 15 million bloggers. The home and work addresses, phone numbers and email of John Leonard were posted to Sina Weibo, a Chinese Twitter-like site. The information was posted by Kaifu Lee who once ran Google in China. He has since deleted Tuesday's post but not before it was retweeted 14,000 times. Going public: Kaifu Lee posted the details of American swimming coach John Leonard on to Chinese site Sina Weibo - where they were seen by his 15 million followers . Mr Lee wrote that he had read numerous articles on 16-year-old swimmer Ye Shiwen and that all were 'relentless attacks from John Leonard'. According to the BBC, he then wrote:  'John Leonard should apologize. Below . are his background and contact details. If you want to contact him, I . suggest using civilised and factual approach.' Twitter user @fryan reported that among the responses to Mr Lee's remarks on Weibo were Internet users telling others to hack into Mr Leonard's computer and even one chilling comment saying the coach should be killed. The post was also picked up by users on Twitter many of whom expressed outrage at Mr Lee's actions. Mr Lee has since issued an apology, saying he did not want to tarnish China's image. Row: Chinese swimmer Shiwen Ye has won two gold medals but American coach John Leonard cast doubt on her success . Counter-attack: Michael Phelps, who became the greatest-ever Olympian after winning 15 golds, was criticized for his stunning performance by a former Olympic team doctor in China . He wrote on Weibo: 'I apologize for the inappropriateness of my actions, and any inconveniences this may have caused John. At the same time, I sincerely hope that John would also consider an apology to Ye Shiwen.' Describing Miss Ye as a 'superwoman', Mr Leonard, executive director of the World Swimming Coaches Association, triggered the controversy on Monday by casting doubt on her performance. Miss Ye's extraordinary swim came in the 400m individual medley, in which she managed the last 50m of the freestyle leg in 28.93 seconds – compared with the 29.1 seconds 27-year-old American swimmer Ryan Lochte managed in the men's event minutes earlier. Leonard suggested the performance was reminiscent of swimmers at previous Olympics who had subsequently been caught for using performance-enhancing drugs. Miss Ye denied accusations that she has ever used substances, saying that her success comes from rigorous training five hours a day, for nine years. Information superhighway: Sina Weibo, started in 2009, is China's leading micro-blogging site and is used by more than 300 million Chinese . Earlier this week, British journalist Guy Adams was kicked off Twitter after he posted the email address for an NBC executive following a row over Olympic coverage. Adams called the network 'utter, utter b******s' on his Twitter page and encouraged his followers to email NBC's Olympics President Gary Zenkel with their complaints. The site responded by promptly shutting down Adams' account. However the company later apologised and reinstated the journalist's feed. Since the start of the London 2012 Games, China and the U.S. have entered a tit-for-tat over their Olympic swimming champions. Earlier this week, a former Chinese Olympic team doctor suggested that U.S. champion Michael Phelps may have used performance-enhancing drugs. Doctor Chen Zhanghao, who led medical staff at four previous games, said he believed Phelps, who is now the greatest-ever Olympian, was guilty of doping - but had no evidence for his claims.","Kaifu Lee revealed personal information of American coach John Leonard on blogging site Weibo .

BBC chiefs have ordered their news teams to stop focusing so much on Team GB’s stunning Olympics success. Director general Mark Thompson is said to be ‘increasingly unhappy’ with the patriotic tone of the news coverage of the Games. News presenters such as George Alaghia and Sophie Raworth have celebrated Team GB’s performance as the number of gold medals rocketed to 24 yesterday, with many of the winners featured at the top of every bulletin. TV and radio newsroom staff were astonished by an email sent yesterday, which told them to focus on the achievements of other nations as well as our own. In the message, titled ‘An order from the DG’, director of news Helen Boaden wrote: ‘Mark Thompson is increasingly unhappy that we are focusing far too much on Team GB’s performance to the exclusion of all else. ‘This is also becoming a theme within the Press. ‘As editor in chief, he has issued a directive that this needs to change from today. So you need to get cracking on making that shift.’ BBC news editors were irritated at the tone of Miss Boaden’s email. Is the BBC's Olympics coverage too biased towards Team GB? One insider told the Mail: ‘We never get direct orders like this. ‘It is only natural that our viewers and listeners want to hear about Team GB’s successes. All the other countries celebrate their own medal winners. ‘It would be a shame if we had to water down our coverage to satisfy an abstract notion of fairness.’ Indeed, last night’s Six O’Clock  bulletin led on the two golds for boxer Nicola Adams and dressage rider Charlotte Dujardin.

It was a fitting tribute to a Games that has seen Britain claim its  biggest gold medal haul for more than a century. Just two days after helping to take home the nation’s first-ever dressage medal of any colour, Charlotte Dujardin also became Britain’s first individual Olympic champion in the discipline.

The 26-year-old former stable hand, . who left school at 16 to pursue her dreams of equestrian success, wept . as her near- perfect score of 90.089 per cent flashed up on the . spectators’ screens yesterday. Amid joyous scenes at Greenwich Park, . South London, the 23,000-strong crowd roared as the new golden girl of . dressage, which tests the understanding between horse and rider as they . complete a series of manoeuvres, collected her medal. Kissing her horse Valegro on the nose, . she revealed: ‘This is what dreams are made of and there are no words . to describe it.  I am so proud. This is unbelievable.’ Dujardin and Valegro during their routine, which was set to patriotic classics and went down a storm with the crowd and judges .

Fellow Briton Laura Bechtolsheimer, . 27, the granddaughter of a German billionaire, also brought home the . bronze after performing to a medley of Lion King tracks including I Just . Can’t Wait To Be King. It means Britain’s riders have won . three gold medals in three days, including one for showjumping and . another for the dressage team event, in which the two women took part . alongside Carl Hester. Miss Dujardin’s success is all the more . remarkable given her humble background, which sets her apart from the . wealth of the horsey set, and the fact she only began competing at this . level 18 months ago. Brought up in Enfield, north-west London, she first became interested in horses after riding her mother’s Shetland ponies. The emotion gets a little too much for Dujardin after she collects her gold medal . Dujardin received a massive score from the judges and ran straight to her mum Jane to celebrate . She was only able to buy her first grand prix horse after inheriting some money following the death of her grandmother. Her parents Jane and Ian own a horse . rug washing business called Mucky Rugs Wash Company at their home in . Finmere, Buckinghamshire. She recalls of the £18,000 horse . called Fernandes: ‘My parents don’t have a lot of money and it was only . through my mum’s mum dying, and with her inheritance money we managed to . buy Fernandes at a sale. ‘I started in a showing background. I . was very lucky we had ponies. We had to produce ponies, make them into . something, because we never had the money for top ponies.

Laura Bechtolsheimer with her bronze medal - the German-born 27-year-old was in the lead for a short time . ‘Mum was very good at spotting a cheap one that was also a good one, I learned from that, so Mum taught me a lot.’ She later sold the horse to raise the . funds to buy a house with her fiancé Dean Golding, a decision she said . was the  ‘hardest thing – saying goodbye to my best friend in the whole . world’. Miss Dujardin has won her two Olympic . gold medals on Valegro, which is owned by Hester, one of the country’s . top trainers. She asked if she could have ten days’ work experience in . his yard in Newent, Gloucester – and never left. Golden girl: Double gold medal winner Charlotte Dujardin out of her dressage clothes . Hester allowed her to ride Valegro as . a  novice because she was unable to buy her own pedigree and the pair . did so well together that he decided to let her keep him – sparking a . golden partnership. Some commentators have spoken of the ‘telepathic’ relationship both horse and rider seem to share. Miss Dujardin’s sister Emma Jayne, 29, yesterday said the family were  hoping to be able to raise enough money to buy Valegro. She added: ‘She always said that at her first Olympics she would win gold and she did. It hasn’t sunk in she’s really done it. ‘It’s very emotional for her because . it could be the last ride on Valegro. We want to win the lottery and buy . him for her. She is a very, very special sister  and we are incredibly . proud of her.’ Miss Dujardin also admitted to being . ‘naughty’ as a teenager. She dropped out of her comprehensive school in . Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, at 16 after telling her parents that . ‘school’s not going to teach me to ride any better’. Yesterday, she told reporters she ‘didn’t really attend school as you can probably tell’. Hester has also spoken of how he had . spotted her talent ‘straight away’ and offered to give her a job as a . stable girl. Sadly, the 45-year-old missed out on his own medal . yesterday when he came fifth on another of his horses, Uthopia. Last night, he said he was ‘very proud’ of Miss Dujardin, adding: ‘I always said Charlotte was the gold medallist. ‘Valegro is the best horse in the world, just the consummate professional.’ Miss Dujardin, who lives  with her . partner and their boxer dog Winnie in a cottage on Hester’s estate in . Newent, Gloucester, said that the horse ‘means the world to me’. Yesterday, Miss Bechtolsheimer also burst into tears at the end of  her routine. She said her performance was . ‘definitely the best ride I have had’ and that her mount, Mistral . Hojris, whom she calls Alf, had been ‘just on the button’. The wealthy . heiress said it was ‘the first music Alf had really seemed to enjoy . dancing to’, adding: ‘He’s 17 years old and he has given me so much. He . was so beautiful to ride. ‘It’s not a tennis racket, it’s a living animal, and when they fight for you like that it’s very emotional.’ These are the only podium places . Britain has ever won in the discipline since dressage became an Olympic . sport more than 100 years ago. It brings Team GB’s Olympics medal tally in equestrian sports to five, double their previous record. The British team may now be the reigning Olympic dressage champions but spectators would be forgiven for wondering what this most rarefied of equine sports is all about. The discipline dubbed ""horse dancing"" may not look as challenging as the imposing fences on a cross-country course or possess the theatrical element of showjumping, but it is a highly technical test for both horse and rider. Today's event, the individual freestyle to music, was dressage in its most elevated form. The contest allows the rider to choreograph a routine which must combine a certain number of complex movements within a six minute time frame. This is then set to music which should complement the performance. Edward Gal of the Netherlands competes in the Individual dressage today - the event requires years of practice and an amazing affinity between rider and horse . Each rider is marked on his or her technical and artistic expertise, with judges scrutinising rhythm, harmony and the choice of music. Higher points are likely to be awarded when riders attempt particularly challenging manoeuvres. Of particular note is the pirouette - where the animal effectively turns a full circle, with its hind-quarters at the centre - and the piaffe, a highly collected and cadenced trot where the horse remains in one place. In each case, the rider must put his or her mount through its paces, performing more complex movements than are seen in the team event. Producing these results takes years of training as a horse must learn to respond to a series of hand and leg signals. Over time, it will come to associate tiny shifts in the rider's position with certain movements. The objective is for the combination to work calmly together with top marks going to the most elegant partnerships. The goal should always be to achieve harmony between horse and rider, with the animal showing a willingness to perform. A routine should not look forced and riders can use any music they wish - with the competition showcasing everything from Tchaikovsky to The Black Eyed Peas. The use of sound effects, such as Dujardin's decision to incorporate the chimes of Big Ben - is also encouraged. Results are determined by combining both technical and artistic marks and the final score is shown as a percentage. Dressage has been an Olympic sport since 1912.

Anyone with any sympathy for the anti-capitalist movement may have been questioning their judgment yesterday. This was the appalling scene of squalor left by Occupy protesters who camped out on a pretty London green to demonstrate against corporate greed. With no running water or adequate toilet facilities, they managed to leave a putrid assortment of rubbish, rotting food and even human waste. The camp at Finsbury Square, on the edge of London’s financial district, began in October as an extension of the Occupy movement’s protest at St Paul’s Cathedral. The squalid remains of the Occupy protest camp at Finsbury Square in the City of London as the last members of the movement left yesterday leaving the taxpayer to pick up the bill for the cleaning . The camp pictured on Tuesday before the moving began. It is estimated that the total cost to clean up the camps is going to exceed £100,000 . But after 236 days of resistance, the protesters yesterday decided to call it a day and leave before bailiffs arrived. A court order earlier this month gave Islington Council the go-ahead to evict the group and most knew their time was up. Sadly for local residents, the same protesters have now set up home a mile away in a family park. Speaking from the new camp in Shoreditch Park, east London– made up of as many Portuguese and Poles as Britons – one of the occupiers said: ‘Bailiffs are just thugs. Rather than give them the pleasure of evicting us violently, we just moved on peacefully – and left them to clear up eight months of mess.’ The total cost to the taxpayer of . moving the protesters is likely to exceed £100,000, when legal fees and . the clean-up are factored in.  Local businesses were delighted to see . the back of them. Nathan Banning, of the Jo Bean coffee shop, said the protest had cost his business almost £50,000 in lost revenue. He said: ‘It’s been hell these last few months. ‘It just descended into complete depravity and chaos.’ Undeterred: A masked Occupy protester surveys his new camp in Shoreditch Park, east London, which was set up hours after police and bailiffs, evicted campaigners from Finsbury Square, north London . Occupy protestors, who were last night evicted from Finsbury Square in the City of London, have now set up a new camp in Shoreditch Park . The clear-out of the camp, made up of around 135 tents, started at 1am yesterday with no arrests taking place. Council . staff now face the unenviable task of removing the filth. The ground . soil has become so contaminated the top six inches will have to be . replaced for anything to grow. Now residents of the trendy Shoreditch Park face the prospect of a . protracted fight to clear the area of the encampment, which started off with about ten tents but seems to have at least doubled in size by this afternoon. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: . 'We are aware of tents pitched in Shoreditch Park. 'Officers are . monitoring the situation but are not present at the scene. An . appropriate policing plan is in place.' Dozens of police officers and private security guards had taken several hours to clear anti-capitalist protesters from their north London camp after launching the swoop at 1am today. New camp: Police were soon on the scene, but not before Occupy protesters were about to erect around a dozen tents in Shoreditch Park . Green but not so pleasant: Shoreditch Park has now been taken over by the Occupy London protesters who descended on the site within hours of being evicted from Finsbury Square . The camp was set up on the public land of the . square in October, as an extension of the Occupy movement’s protest in . St Paul’s Churchyard - which ended in eviction in February. Today, Metropolitan Police confirmed they were present at the scene which is being cleared by a private security company. Two weeks ago a judge heard the . protest had caused £20,000 damage to the land, cost the council £26,000 . on security, and lost it £12,000 in rent plus income from the square’s . restaurant which had to close. There had been an adverse impact on . local business and complaints about anti-social behaviour from the camp, . which increasingly became a focus for the homeless, and which had no . running water or sufficient toilet facilities. Eviction: Overnight enforcement officers cleared the remaining Occupy protest camp in London's Finsbury Square .

Decision: Two weeks ago a judge heard the protest had caused £20,000 damage to the land, cost the council £26,000 on security, and lost it £12,000 in rent plus income from the square’s restaurant which had to close . Controlled operation: Metal fencing is brought in to seal off the Square during the eviction . Councillor Paul Convery, Islington . Council’s executive member for community safety, said: 'Finsbury Square . is public space for the people of Islington, one of Britain’s most . deprived boroughs. 'We’re returning the square to community use, and it is being cleaned and will soon be reopened to the public for the summer. 'Today’s enforcement action was peaceful and low-key, and I’d like to . thank the police, our street outreach team, and other partner . organisations for their help. 'A number of vulnerable and homeless people have been living in the . square. We have been speaking to them and offering advice and support to . those who need assistance.' Before . protesters were evicted from the neighbouring camp at St. Paul's . Cathedral in February, Finsbury Square was used as an overspill. It later became an 'eco village' where sustainable technologies were showcased. But there was no sign of that now - the once pleasant park is now a barren, litter-strewn dump. Occupy protesters had barricaded themselves into their camp on Finsbury Square in the City of London . Until last night 20-30 'protestors' remained at the Finsbury Square camp - eight months after it was first 'occupied' Islington Borough Council moved in March to start eviction proceedings against the 'residents' of Finsbury Square . Islington Borough Council moved in March to start eviction proceedings against the 'residents' of Finsbury Square. But Tom McCarthy, a resident at Finsbury Square, insists the camp serves an important purpose. He wrote on the Occupy Finsbury Square blog: 'This camp makes a political statement about our society. 'Since Occupy opened the camp on 21 . October, it has become a home and community for many homeless people, . for whom the system has failed. 'In evicting this community, . Islington Council – who have helped to re-home some people that have . ticked certain boxes – are potentially leaving some people in a much . worse position than they are already in. 'We . ask Islington Council to not go down the same route at the City of . London Corporation – cleansing the City of homeless people is not the . way forward. Helping to find real solutions is.' At one time protesters used the square to showcase sustainable technology, but it is now a litter strewn dump . Islington Council claims the camp is now just occupied by vulnerable and homeless people . Banners erected on the camp preached anti-capitalist slogans, despite claims by councillors the square has become a haven for the homeless .

On Friday, a California jury recommended the death penalty . The couple's other daughter Tarah, 13, . was asleep in the family's Riverside, California home on the night of . the killings and testified that she awoke to hear her sister's chilling . cries and a banging sound.

A 13-year-old who scrimped and saved to buy a hot dog stand to help his struggling family is now in a homeless shelter after his city shut his cart down over a permit violation. Previously living with two parents who are both disabled and unemployed, Nathan Duszynski of Holland, Michigan said he hoped his summer business would help his family make ends meet, no matter how small. It was only after claimed misguidance from a city official on what permits he'd need, he failed. Scroll down for video . Helping out: Hoping to help his struggling parents who are on disability and unemployed, 13-year-old Nathan Duszynski purchased this hot dog stand with his savings . 'Nate and I are now in a shelter,' his mother Lynnette who suffers from epilepsy told Mackinac Media. Speaking of her husband, Nathan's step-father Doug Johnson, who has multiple sclerosis, she said their family in result of the transition are no longer together either. 'Doug can't stay with us because he takes prescription narcotics to deal with his pain and the shelter does not allow him with those kinds of drugs,' she said. Together the family receives about $1,300 a month in disability payments, a meagre sum with Mr Johnson recently losing his job. Stepping up to the plate, the 13-year old said he used his savings to purchase the hot dog stand after doing a great deal of research on what could be most successful for business according to the economy and the area. Misguided: Nathan said he spoke with a woman at city hall to ask about required permits needed for business and was told he didn't need one, which was wrong . 'I'm just trying to bring in some money for them and the household as they're struggling,' he told Mackinac Media. He also researched what, if any, permits he'd need. 'We went and we talked with Anna from city hall ... and asked her do we need like a business permit, a license? And she said no,' his mother told Mackinac Media. No more than 10 minutes after setting up shop outside a sporting goods store who granted the boy permission, city officials caught sight of his stand and asked about that permit. Not having one, they told him he'd have to close up shop right away. Law: While on private property in a store's parking lot of a store that permitted his business, the city outlaws food carts downtown without a permit as they distract from restaurants who pay taxes . 'I thought, wow, I'm getting shut down all ready and I haven't even started,' Nathan said. According to CBS, the stand was within the city's downtown commercial zone where food carts not affiliated with restaurants are not permitted. City of Holland Assistant Manager Greg Robinson said that the rule was established as a protection to restaurants in the area who pay property costs, unlike food carts. 'This is a great opportunity for him, and it would be great to work with him and we can in many commercial areas of the city. This just happens to be one where he can't,' Mr Robinson told Mackinac Media last week. Moves: Nathan sold his cart but as luck would have it to a man who allowed him to keep it for use, though that didn't stop his family from moving to a homeless shelter . Changing his hot dog stand's sign to 'for sale' Nathan has since sold his cart, but not exactly at a loss. CBS reports a local businessman having purchased the cart while allowing him to keep it for his use, entirely for free. Nathan has since taken the cart to private events. Not without new challenges, however, his next he said is the health department: Each event he works he says he has to purchase a new permit from them. Nathan said it's difficult for him to turn any kind of profit with all of the extra costs.

A post-mortem has revealed she was battered to death . A wealthy business-woman’s beaten and charred body was found at the country home where she ran an upmarket cattery. The body of Diana Lee, 54, was found in a burnt-out garage at her £500,000 gated property in the heart of the Cheshire countryside. A post-mortem examination revealed she had suffered horrendous head injuries in a violent attack and had not died as a result of the blaze. It is thought that Mrs Lee had been involved in a legal dispute involving the cattery in the run-up to her death. The alarm was raised last Thursday morning by a postman who noticed the garage at the isolated property in the affluent village of Cranage had been badly damaged. He called the fire brigade who carried out a search and discovered the body inside. Detectives investigating Miss Lee’s murder later found her silver Vauxhall Corsa, which had been burnt out, in the village of Mobberley, ten miles away from her home. Police received reports that a man was seen getting on a bicycle near the car and pedalling away from the scene. Miss Lee’s former partner, Neville Barrett, 48, was arrested and has since been released on bail pending further investigations. Last night residents of Cranage said they were ‘shocked and appalled’ by the death of their polite and well-liked neighbour. One villager said: ‘This is  totally appalling. It is the talk of the village. Everyone is just stunned by the news that a friend, neighbour and true gentlewoman could be so brutally killed.’ Another said: ‘This has all come as a complete shock to everybody  and is very upsetting. ‘She was quite sweet although we hardly ever saw her. ‘This is a really affluent area with lots of wealthy people so it is quite unsettling.’ Difficult: Forensic teams remove items from Mrs Lee's property. Cheshire Police said officers were hunting a mystery cyclist seen riding away from the spot where the Corsa was found abandoned . A neighbour said: ‘She was a very quiet lady but she was very nice. ‘She looked after the cats like they were her own. ‘It is quite a large property so they had plenty of room for them. It is all very strange to us here.’ Mrs Lee and Mr Barrett opened the . Parklands Cattery two years ago after buying the substantial property in . 2008. Cats staying there were accommodated in the lap of luxury, with . furnished living areas with televisions and stereos, heated playrooms . and outdoor exercise runs. Its website boasted that the cattery . was set in the ‘luxurious surroundings of the Cheshire countryside’, . offering ‘the ultimate in comfort, fun and hygiene for your cat’. Moving: Flowers left in tribute to Mrs Lee. Detectives want to trace any members of the public who saw a man cycling from Smith Lane, where the car was abandoned, towards Pepper Street in Mobberley between 10 and 11am on Thursday . The couple, who had been together for several years, later split up and Mr Barrett moved out of the house. None of the 12 cats at the premises . were injured in the blaze and all have since been transferred to another . cattery. Last night detectives appealed for information about the . cyclist seen riding away from the abandoned car. They are also keen to trace members of the public who might have seen the man cycle off. Detective Inspector Steve Beddows of . Cheshire Police said: ‘We are particularly keen to  speak to anyone who . saw any activity in the vicinity of the home address of Mrs Lee on the . morning of Thursday, August 9, before the arrival of the emergency . services at 11am. ‘We also appeal to anyone who may have . seen a man acting suspiciously near to a silver Corsa in Mobberley, . which was later identified as belonging to the victim and had been taken . from her house.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Diana Lee, 54, suffered fatal injuries in brutal attack at large gated property .

A University of Texas graduate student was left fighting for his life on Thursday after two chimpanzees pounced on him at the South African reserve where he was studying their behaviour, dragging him along the ground for more than a mile. The mother of 26-year-old Andrew Oberle said that her son had been passionate about chimps since watching a documentary about famous naturalist Jane Goodall in seventh grade. Mary Flint added that her son knew the risks involved in working with apes, and said that the attack would probably not stop him carrying out further research. Attack: Andrew Oberle, a University of Texas graduate student was savaged by two chimps while leading a group of tourists at the Jane Goodall Institute in South Africa . Brutal: Andrew Oberle, was dragged more than a mile by the chimps . In a case that mirrors that of Charla Nash, a Connecticut woman, who in 2009 had her face ripped off by a 200-pound chimp, Mr Oberle suffered a ‘frenzied’ attack, in which he was bitten multiple times. The . beasts, named Mickey and Amadeus, grabbed him by his feet and yanked . him down the road, under a fence and into their enclosure at the Jane Goodall Institute Chimp Eden near Nelspruit, South Africa, where paramedics were forced to wait for armed escorts before they could go in and treat him. Mr Oberle, an American researcher, was giving tourists . a lecture at the sanctuary as part of his master's degree in Anthropology and Primatology, based at the University of Texas at San Antonio. He had crossed the first of two fences separating the chimpanzees from visitors and was standing close to the second fence, which is electrified, when the attack began. The tourists were escorted to safety . by staff members as the chimpanzees dragged Mr Oberle out of their . enclosure. The sanctuary's director fired shots into the air to scare . the chimps away from the man, before chasing the animals back into . their enclosure. Brutal: Stacey Johns (right) a friend of Oberle's on Facebook, was hit in the head by a rock launched by Cozy (left). 'Cozy may hit people in the head with rocks but it's not his fault' Oberle wrote on the site . Calm before the storm: On Facebook these sleeping chimps (not the ones which attacked) are described as 'cute' Animal lover: In this undated photo Andrew Orbele poses one of his charges . Medics stabilised the graduate at the scene and he was taken by ambulance to a private hospital in Nelspruit. Beeld reported that he lost part of an ear and parts of his fingers. 'When . we found him, he was in a foetal position underneath a lapa (a roofed, . open-walled structure) with massive injuries, lacerations, abrasions, . partial amputation from his head to toe,' Lloyd Krause, ER24 emergency . service spokesman told the Herald Sun. 'He lost an ear, he lost a number of . fingers and toes, he's got very deep wounds, he's got total removal of . skin and muscle off his one leg and his one arm, fractures all over the . place.' On Oberle's Facebook page he is listed as . being from Saint Louis, Missouri. He now lives in San Antonio, Texas, but has been in South Africa since May. He recently posted . photographs of the chimps he was working with on the website, tagged with comments such . as 'so cute' beside a picture of two of them sleeping. Another . portrays a wide-mouthed chimp named Cozy, who suffered brain damage . after being abused prior to his rescue. Oberle describes the primate as . 'still the best', adding:  'Cozy may hit people in the head with rocks but it's not his fault'. One of Cozy's victims, Stacey Johns, is also pictured in the album with blood pouring from a wound in her head. Powerful beasts: Chimpanzees sit in an enclosure at the Chimp Eden rehabilitation center, near Nelspruit, South Africa . Brutal: The 26-year-old was dragged for more than a mile by the chimps at the Goodall Institute Chimp Eden (pictured) Oberle, apparently fascinated by the . primates, was experimenting with different food types and on Monday . wrote that they enjoyed an offering of oatmeal. Last Saturday he wrote . that 'mustard was a big hit'. The sanctuary opened six years ago and is home to rescued chimpanzees, many of which suffered horrific abuse, hunted for their meat or used in the entertainment industry or at roadside zoos. One adult male arrived almost completely shaven and dressed as a little boy, wearing a gold watch and carrying a suitcase of clothes, the center's website said. David Oosthuizen, executive director, said in a statement: 'This is a terrible tragedy that should never happen. All our thoughts and prayers are with this young man and his family.' He added that the chimps’ power makes . them a force to be feared. They have six times the . strength of a human being. 'Any interaction between humans and wild animals can be dangerous as wild animals are often very strong and can act aggressively if approached or if they feel threatened,' Oosthuizen said. 'Additionally, the chimpanzees at Chimp Eden have suffered horrible injuries and abuse from humans and therefore have to be treated with caution.' The two chimpanzees were placed in their night enclosure after the attack and will be held there pending the investigation, after which they would be returned to their enclosure, said chairman Edwin Jay. In a statement a spokesman from Oberle's university said: 'We were saddened to learn that one of our students, Andrew Oberle, sustained serious injuries as the result of a chimpanzee attack. Our hearts go out to Andrew and his family.' In May Oberle was awarded in Geographic Information Science from UTSA. Prior to enrolling at the school he studied at St Mary's University in San Antonio. Critical: Andrew Oberle (left) is fighting for his life following the vicious attack in which he was dragged by the chimps for more than one mile . In 2009 Charla Nash, 58, almost died in a . horrific mauling that saw her lose her eyesight, lips, nose, and hands . after being savaged by Travis, a dangerous 200-pound chimpanzee. Ms Nash has filed papers accusing state officials of . failing to seize the animal before the mauling despite a staff member's . warning that it was dangerous. In documents attorneys explain why she should be allowed to sue the state . Department of Energy and Environmental Protection for $150 million. The commissioner must approve any lawsuit against the state. A hearing was set for August 10. Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen says the state shouldn't be held liable. She received a revolutionary . full-face transplant in June 2011 at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, nearly two years after the attack. The operation – performed by a team of more than 30 surgeons and nurses – and subsequent recovery were widely covered. Prior to the surgery, she hid her face under a veil, saying that she chose to wear it ‘so I don’t scare people.’ In an interview Ms Nash told the Hartford Courant that she feels no different than she did before the attack. ‘I just feel like it’s my face,’ she said. ‘It’s just not working real good. Every day, my muscles get better.' In past interviews, . Ms Nash revealed that having a new face allowed her simple human . pleasures – she has regained her sense of smell and can eat again. She is even regaining sensation in her forehead, cheeks, eyebrow, and nose. But most of all, she’s learning how to smile. ‘It creases up here,’ Ms Nash told the Courant as she pointed at her mouth. ‘I don’t know what the future’s doing (sic) to bring… so I don’t get my hopes up,’ Ms Nash said, . Strong: 200-lb chimpanzee Travis attacked in 2009. Experts warned chimps can be up to six times as strong as a human . But she added that she wants to progress far enough that she can again ride horses and live in her own house. She . said she misses simple things – like being able to bargain hunt, bask . in the sunshine, or even look at her 20-year-old daughter, Brianna. ‘I have to depend on a lot of help,’ she said. ‘My life depends on really not being alone. I used to be very independent.’ She also gets phantom pains in her hands, despite the fact that they were removed after the 2009 attack. Transplants added in surgery later had to be removed because of dangerous complications. In an interview with ABC 7 last month, Ms Nash – who likes being called Charlie – said she doesn’t want anybody’s pity. ‘I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me,’ she said. ‘I want to be like everyone else.’ She has been told by doctors that she needs to work on bulking up, as she is still quite thin for her 5ft 10in frame. Ms Nash, who was blinded in the 2009 . attack, was fitted with brown glass eyes and hopes to get a double hand . transplant after the first one failed. Ara Chekmayan, a spokesman for the Nash family, told the Mail Online: 'The horrific chimpanzee attack that occurred today involving the American student further highlights the danger that these animals pose and their violent nature. 'Charla Nash knows as well as anyone the tremendous harm that a chimpanzee can inflict. Her thoughts and prayers go out to the young man and his family.'

Ministers warned that plans to allow . homeowners to build extensions and conservatories of up to almost 30ft . without permission will be a recipe for neighbour disputes. Although . the property was built from scratch starting six years ago, Mr Russum's . construction is an example of the kind of outlandish designs which . could spring up without objection now David Cameron has relaxed planning . laws so homeowners can develop without permission. MPs and planning experts have warned of a divisive planning 'free-for-all' now 'permitted development rights' are set to be relaxed for three years. The proposals from Communities Secretary Eric Pickles will double the size of extensions that can be built without permission. A consultation will be published soon. Andrew Smith, a former Labour Cabinet minister, said: ‘I’m very concerned that we will see an explosion of unsightly and un-neighbourly development. 'By scrapping planning controls the Government will leave many people powerless to maintain a decent quality environment. Prestigious: Mr Russum's design won an architectural award last year, earning praise for 'maximising the potential of a narrow infill site' Leafy: Four-bedroom houses on Wood Lane regularly fetch asking prices of £3.5m . 'You will have people putting up huge extensions and to hell with the neighbours. 'I want people to get on and be able to improve their homes, but it has to be done in a neighbourly way. 'If this goes ahead I have no doubt we will see some very serious neighbour disputes, with no one to arbitrate in the way the planning system does at the moment.' Families on the desirable Wood Lane in Highgate, North London, say the long-running construction of Mr Russum's house has left their road a 'mess' and even forced property prices down. The house is in a conservation area surrounded by homes built in the late 18th century, and was designed by architects Birds Portchmouth Russum (BPR), owned by partner in the firm Mr Russum. Last year the design won the Architecture Prize at the Royal Academy’s Summer Exhibition, which described the posh pad as a ‘four-storey house (which) maximises the potential of a narrow infill site’. It adds: 'The traditional relationship of living and sleeping accommodation is inverted with the bedroom and bathrooms at garden level and the living area above to enjoy the south aspect and views over London. 'The high-level living element (is) prefabricated and craned into position.' But neighbours have this week slammed the house - saying it makes the prestigious road look a ‘total and utter mess’ with its fenced off entrance, scattered traffic cones and blue tarpaulin. Who are these guys? Josh Wood, nine, looks a little bewildered as David Cameron and Nick Clegg hold forth during a visit to a housing development in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire . They are now demanding to know when the house - which is wedged between two existing homes - will be finished, six years since construction work began. Owner Mike Russum blamed planning laws, which he says delayed the completion of the house. He told the Ham and High newspaper this week: 'Certainly there has been fierce opposition by a few neighbours. 'We understand the concerns about the delay to its completion, which has been painfully experienced by us. 'The house is not conventional and explores various architectural ideas about creating a joyful home appropriate to this age. 'It is unashamedly modern and we accept that it will not be everybody’s cup of tea. 'However, the design won the Architecture Prize at the Royal Academy Exhibition last year and we consider that to be a cultured endorsement.'","Residents in leafy North London suburb claim development has left their street a 'total mess'

Victim: The body of Colin Dodds was found early this morning in a pool of water . A couple were in mourning yesterday after their teenage son was found dead in a river – the third of their five children they have lost. Sixteen-year-old Colin Dodds got into difficulties while swimming with two friends on Saturday evening and disappeared under the surface before he could make it to the river bank. His body was found by police divers  early yesterday. The tragedy comes three years after parents Colin, 38, and Wendy, 40, lost another son, Ryan, who died suddenly at the age of 14 from multiple organ failure. He had been diagnosed at birth with Hirschsprung’s disease, a rare condition that affects the bowels, and was on lifelong medication. The couple’s first child, Kenneth, died in 1992 at six weeks from complications associated with his premature birth. They also have two daughters, Rebecca, 19, and 13-year-old Nikkita. The family live on a close-knit estate in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, but their home appeared empty yesterday. It is thought family members had spent the night on the banks of the Wear in the town, waiting for news, until divers located Colin’s body at 4.20am. A neighbour, who didn’t want to be named, said: ‘Your heart just goes out to the family. They’ve lost three boys now, and it’s just heart-breaking. No one deserves to lose one child let alone three.’ Colin and his friends, also 16, are said to have entered the river at Batts Pool, a deep but slow-moving section of water which is a popular spot for fishing. Tragedy: Colin with his mother Wendy, centre, and sisters Nikkita, left and Rebecca. He was swimming with friends when he got into difficulties . All-night hunt: Search and rescue teams on the River Wear were called out after the alarm was raised . After his friends raised the alarm a . major search was launched, including an RAF jet which conducted an . infrared scan of the river in an attempt to locate the teenager. Chief Inspector Sukhsham Sahani of . Durham Constabulary said yesterday: ‘There’s some suggestion that Colin . was a weak swimmer. It’s too early to tell exactly why he went under . though. ‘It was a very pleasant, sunny day, but it’s not commonplace for people to actually go diving in at that particular area. ‘The Wear is well known as being unpredictable, you can never estimate the current. ‘I accept that there is a temptation . on a sunny day to paddle and play around the banks but I want to . reinforce the message to teenagers that they should be particularly . mindful of the dangers of playing by a river. ‘The family are distraught, it’s been a tragic end.’ Searching: An emergency service crew in a dinghy on the River Wear in Bishop Auckland during the hunt for missing teenager Colin Dodds . Rescue operation: A helicopter hovers over the River Wear after the teenager got into difficulties while swimming with friends . Another of the couple’s neighbours . said: ‘People don’t often go swimming there, but there’s no way I’ll let . my kids play down there any more. It’s too dangerous. The family must . be in bits about Colin.’ The teenager is the second child to die in the Wear this year. On April 27, the river was the scene . of a major search and rescue operation when eight-year-old Ian Bell was . swept to his death as he played with friends at a stretch near the Brown . Trout pub at  Sunnybrow, near Willington, County Durham. The river was swollen with rainfall at the time. Ian’s body was recovered nine days later. A teenage boy has told how he desperately tried to save his best friend from a river after he began struggling in the water. A major search and rescue operation was launched after Colin Dodds, 16, got into difficulties in the River Wear at Bishop Auckland at 5.15pm. Colin and his friends Ryan Howard and Marwan Barq, both 16, had gone to cool off at an area known as Batts Pool near to the Market Square in the town when Colin disappeared. After an extensive search involving three helicopters, fire and rescue teams, police, and a Hazardous Area Response Team, Colin’s body was recovered in the early hours of Saturday morning from near the bottom of the deep section of the river, close to where his friends last saw him. Ryan, who had known Colin for around five years and described him as his best friend, told how he attempted to reach Colin before he went under the water. 'I tried to grab him and I tried to swim towards him, but I couldn’t get to him,' he said. 'I stretched my arm out, but I couldn’t reach him, he was too far away. 'He shouted he couldn’t swim, I just started panicking. I told him to kick his legs and arms as much as he could, but then I just saw his head go under and it didn’t come back up. 'I just got out and ran up to the bank to get help. A man rang for an ambulance. I was in so much shock. I was crying and shaking.' Colin and his friends had been to Darlington before they returned home to Bishop Auckland. Ryan said: 'We just went in the river to cool off because it was too hot. 'We’ve never been up this part of the river before, but we just went in. My mum woke me up on Sunday morning to tell me they had found the body at around 4am. 'As soon as I heard I just went and got some flowers and came back up the river to lay them.' Colin had just started a painting and decorating course at Bishop Auckland college with his friend. It is the second tragedy to have occurred on the river this year. In April, eight-year-old Ian Bell of Sunnybrow, County Durham, died after falling into the River Wear as he played with friends by the water near the Brown Trout pub in the village.","Colin Dodds was unable to reach river bank after getting into difficulties .

Free man: Judge Hagen said that Mustafa should not be jailed because it would just cost the taxpayer even more money . A Somali benefits cheat has been spared jail because the judge sentencing him said the cost of locking him up for a year would be the same as the amount he swindled. Karmal Mustafa dishonestly claimed £38,856.50 of income support, council tax and housing benefit while working over a seven-year period to support two families. He told investigators the money he was sending overseas helped support . his sick father - but then told his barrister his father and mother had both . been killed in front of his eyes in Somalia 14 years ago. But despite this discrepancy Judge Carol Hagen told Bristol Crown Court that he would not go to prison. '£39,000 is what it costs to keep one man in prison for a year. Do I wish to burden the state further with another £38,000 to £40,000, much as I think it is deserved?' she said. Instead the judge handed Mustafa a 24-week suspended sentence, ordered him to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and pay £250 costs. The court heard 29-year-old Mustafa was using his dual income to support two families - one in his native Somalia and one in Bristol. Simon Emslie, prosecuting, said Mustafa fraudulently obtained £25,676.20 in income support between 2004 and last year. He said that over the same time, Mustafa pocketed £10,297.49 in housing benefit and £2.882.81 in council tax benefit. The court heard the benefits were claimed on the basis Mustafa was unfit to work, but he had actually had a job. He managed to evade detection because of inadequate employers’ records and by giving different addresses, bank account and national insurance numbers, Mr Emslie said. Mustafa told the Department for Work and Pensions he had worked since 2004 and he did not inform them because he was regularly sending £800 to £1,000 to Somalia to support his family, including his father, who had cancer. The court heard he had paid back £200 in income support and £520 in council tax benefit. Scam: Bristol Crown Court, pictured, heard how the Somali man was pocketing benefits for not being able to work while having a job . Judge Hagen asked Paul Cook, defending: 'If he was sending £800 to £1,000 to Somalia, why is he not paying that to the Department for Work and Pensions?' Mr Cook said his client had only been able to do that because he was living off his fraudulent benefits, and sending his earnings out of the UK. Mr Cook described Mustafa’s early life in Somalia as 'hell', and said he had seen his mother and father killed when he was aged 15, and seen his brothers and sisters killed a year later. The court heard that in 2005 Mustafa married a girl from his village, who gave birth to twins who both died - one of them three days before the hearing. Mustafa now has two children and one on the way with another woman, who came to the UK in 2007, does not speak English and is 'utterly dependant' on him, Mr Cook said. Judge Hagen asked: “Why is it that a man facing serious criminal charges embarks on a third child? It seems seriously irresponsible.” Mr Cook said: 'He only intended one child.' The judge replied: 'He’s a grown man. He can take his own preventative measures.'","Karmal Mustafa was let off a one year prison term because he had cost the public purse enough, Judge Hagen said .

When your granny mentions her haggard old mop bucket or tea-leaf tin, the last place you think they'll end up is in an erotic novel. But for one County Down artist, her paintings have been immortalised in the pages of Fifty Shades Of Grey, the saucy story that has raised eyebrows – and pulses – around the world. Jennifer Trouton, 40, is good friends with the book's author, E L James – real name Erika Mitchell – whose husband is from Newry. The painter says her catapult to 'mummy porn' fame is 'surreal'. ‘I’m really honoured that she put my work in the books. I have no Protestant or Catholic guilt where I’m like, “I can’t be part of an erotic book!”’ she said. ‘I’m just quite pleased that she liked it.’ Her work is mentioned in all three of the books. In the first, a mosaic is hanging in businessman Christian Grey’s office, creating the backdrop when he meets Anastasia Steele – who later becomes his sex slave. The books says: 'Everything is white – ceiling, floors and walls – except for the wall by the door where a mosaic of small paintings hang. 'Thirty-six of them arranged in a square. A series of mundane, forgotten objects, painted in such precise detail they looked like photographs.' Miss Trouton, from Portadown, said that the popular author was particularly struck by one of her works,  'Looking At the Overlooked', which comprises more than 300 smaller works on board depicting household objects. She said: 'Erika saw them when she came to a viewing of mine in London in 2006. It was very large, 300 pictures – she scaled it back to 36 in the book – all of very mundane objects you might see around the house.' The work, which is a metaphor for the mundane becoming extraordinary, is discussed by the two main characters in the book's opening chapter. Miss Trouton added that the works also reflects the sordid relationship between the two characters: 'She is quite an ordinary girl, but Christian finds her extraordinary.' It is referred to again at the end of the third book Fifty Shades Freed, when Christian recalls first meeting Anastasia. And in the second book, Fifty Shades Darker, another of Trouton’s paintings is donated to a charity auction. From household to hot stuff: Jennifer Trouton's work of everyday objects in Looking At The Overlooked, which is divided into 300 smaller depictions, features in the Fifty Shades trilogy . Influence: This painting, which includes depictions of teapots and mop buckets, has a starring role in the steamy novels . So was Miss Trouton, whose paintings fetch from £715 (€900) to £9,500 (€12,000), surprised by her friend's steamy imagination? 'Well, I have to say it is very funny when you know someone quite well and you think, “Oh my goodness, you’re into that!”’ she giggles. 'But she did most of her research online. She has a very happy, normal family and home life.' Mosaics or mummy porn?: E L James writes of a mosaic, similar to this one, hanging in businessman Christian Grey's office . Capturing everyday life: The author was captivated by the 300 pictures painted by Jennifer Trouton of mundane objects found around the house . The secretive painter kept her involvement in the books hidden from even family and friends. Her Facebook page is full of witty comments, including one from her brother Stevie saying, 'I'm telling Dad!' 'For now I’m just happy for people to be seeing my work,' shrugs Jennifer. 'That’s what all artists want ultimately.' Humbled: Jennifer Trouton says she is pleased her works are mentioned in the popular series .

Sitting on board an Olympics 2012 boat, David Cameron appeared casual and relaxed as he watched the RS:X windsurfer medal race with Ben Ainslie, the greatest sailing Olympian of all time yesterday. But politics were still on his mind as he publicly rebuffed Nick Clegg yesterday . after the Lib Dems decided to wreck Government plans to slash the number . of MPs and redraw constituency boundaries. The Prime Minister said he would still hold a vote on the issue despite the betrayal of his Coalition partners – a move designed to humiliate the Lib Dems if they publicly oppose something they have vocally supported in the past.

Crowd spirit: David Cameron and his wife Samantha take part in the wave cheer during a women's semi-final beach volleyball match between China and the United States . Tories will now personally target Mr Clegg, who has previously made impassioned pleas supporting boundary changes when he marshalled the legislation through the Commons. Mr Clegg said in September 2010: ‘To the people we serve it is patently obvious that individuals’ votes should carry the same weight, and if that means reforming the rules for drawing boundaries, that is what we must do. That unfairness is deeply damaging to our democracy.’ The 2010 Lib Dem manifesto also vowed to ‘reduce the number of MPs by 150’, yet the Deputy Prime Minister is now opposing a cut of just 50 MPs to 600. Mr Clegg unveiled the tit-for-tat move on Monday after Tory MPs refused to back his plans for House of Lords reform. Mr Cameron is under pressure from his backbenchers, who plan to summon him to their influential 1922 Committee next month to explain how he will win a majority at the next election now that the Tories seem unlikely to pick up the gains in seats boundary changes might have delivered. The Prime Minister made clear that he would not back down and now plans to pile pressure on Lib Dem ministers by arguing that it is fair and sensible that constituency boundaries be redrawn. Fight back: Nick Clegg, pictured leaving his home today, has accused the Conservatives of breaking their coalition agreement over the Lords reform . Decision: Visiting an activity centre in mid-Wales, Mr Cameron made clear he intended to push forward with the changes when they come back to the Commons in the autumn . The current system is seen as unfair since some seats contain nearly twice as many voters as others, so the Tories tend to need an 11 per cent lead in the opinion polls to win a majority compared with just 3 per cent for Labour. Mr Clegg’s decision to ditch support for the plans could cost the Tories 20 seats in 2015. The Deputy Prime Minister wants to see the boundary review abandoned. But Mr Cameron said yesterday: ‘We want the boundary change vote to go ahead. I am going to be saying to every MP, “Look, the House of Commons ought to be smaller, it ought to be less expensive and we ought to have seats that are exactly the same size”. ‘I think everyone should come forward and vote for that proposal because it is a very sensible proposal and it will be put forward.’ Mucking in: David Cameron takes part in a team building maze puzzle at the centre . Speaking out: Prime Minister David Cameron speaks to young adults in the National Citizen Service scheme who are taking part in team building exercises, at the Outdoor Education Facility . The Prime Minister also said he ‘doesn’t accept at all’ claims by Mr Clegg that the Tory party has broken an agreement with its Lib Dem coalition partners. Senior Tory backbenchers are furious that the Lib Dems have abandoned support and are agitating for Mr Cameron to kick them out of the Cabinet. An influential figure on the backbenches told the Mail that if Lib Dem ministers are not threatened with the sack for defying government policy, Tory ministers would now rebel themselves and the Coalition would collapse into ‘chaos’. Lib Dem Foreign Office minister Jeremy Browne insisted Lords reform and boundary changes were part of the same ‘constitutional package’ and should both be abandoned. He confirmed that he would vote against them. In fact, the Coalition Agreement linked the referendum on electoral reform to the boundary changes – not, as the Lib Dems claim, to House of Lords reforms.","Vowed to press ahead despite a warning his Liberal Democrat coalition partners intend to wreck the plan .

Anthrax is very rare but it's a bacterial infection caused by Bacillus anthracis (pictured) A drug user has died after being infected with anthrax, health experts said. The Health Protection Agency said that a person who injected drugs died in hospital in Blackpool. The name of the person or the hospital has not been disclosed. The HPA said the source of the infection is presumed to be contaminated heroin. The news comes after a spate of cases in Europe since early June. The HPA said it is 'unclear' whether the case in Blackpool and another case in Scotland - which was confirmed at the end of July - are linked to the European outbreak. Anthrax is a rare bacterial infection and is primarily a disease of herbivorous mammals, though other animals and some birds can also contract it. Bacillus anthracis spores can survive in the environment for years or decades. Dependent on the dose and route of exposure, the symptoms may develop within a week of taking heroin. An HPA spokesperson said: 'The patient . comes from the north west of England and was taken to hospital earlier . this week and died shortly afterwards. 'The infection was cultured in the laboratory and the results came back last night that it was anthrax. 'It is very difficult to identify the . source of the anthrax because the spores are miniscule. We do not know . where it may have originated. 'We are telling people on the ground who . work with drugs users to be aware of the danger and look out for gashes . that develop around injection sites. Addict: Heroin users have been warned to look out for signs of infection which include redness or . excessive swelling or high temperatures, chills or headache . 'You can treat anthrax with antibiotics . if caught early, otherwise it can be fatal. That is the vital message we . are trying to get out.' Since June there have been seven . confirmed cases of the infection - one in Scotland, three in Germany, . two in Denmark, and one in France. These are the first cases of anthrax among drug users in Europe since the outbreak during 2009 and 2010. That outbreak saw 119 cases in Scotland, five cases in England and two cases in Germany. Among . them was heroin user Shane Brown, 24, from Blackpool, who died after . testing positive for anthrax at the town's Victoria Hospital in 2010. Signs of infection include redness or . excessive swelling at the injection site, or a high temperature, . chills or a severe headache or breathing difficulties. Infection: The Health Protection Agency said that a person who injected drugs died in hospital in Blackpool - although the hospital has not been named . Dr Dilys Morgan, an expert in . zoonotic infections at the HPA, said: 'It's likely that further cases . among PWID (people who inject drugs) will be identified as part of the . ongoing outbreak in EU countries. 'The . Department of Health has alerted the NHS of the possibility of PWID . presenting to emergency departments and walk-in clinics, with symptoms . suggestive of anthrax. 'Anthrax . can be cured with antibiotics, if treatment is started early. It is . therefore important for medical professionals to know the signs and . symptoms to look for, so that there are no delays in providing the . necessary treatment.' European health experts say that the recent . cases could have come from the same batch of contaminated heroin in the . 2009 to 2010 outbreak. Dr Morgan added: 'As part of the . response to the 2009/10 outbreak, the HPA developed an algorithm for the . clinical evaluation and management of PWID with possible anthrax. 'This algorithm specifies the kinds of presentations where anthrax should be considered, and outlines the actions to take.' Anthrax in drug users was considered to be very rare. Prior to the 2009-2010 outbreak in Scotland, just one previous case had been reported in Norway in 2000. The risk to the general population is negligible. It is extremely rare for anthrax to be spread from person to person.","The source of the infection is presumed to be contaminated heroin .

Rising numbers of women are turning to DIY and skilled trades amid the recession, it has been revealed. They are enrolling on training courses to learn crafts such as plastering, decorating, plumbing and tiling. Some want to save money by improving their own homes while others are setting up their own businesses after being made redundant or opting for career changes. DIY workshops across the country organised by B&Q have experienced a five-fold increase in female take up in the last year. Over 3,200 enrolled in classes to learn skills such as plastering, wall tiling, changing taps and hanging wallpaper in July 2012 compared to 592 at the same point last year. There was a 92 per cent increase between January and July this year alone - up from 1,698. A B&Q spokeswoman said: 'Whether it's to save money, avoid being ripped off or to just increase confidence around the home, women are skilling up.' Statistics show that women are also embarking on training to allow them to enter the male dominated skilled trades sector. JTL, the leading training provider to the building services sectors, has seen a five-fold increase in demand from women apprentices. Just six women signed up for plumbing or electrical apprenticeships in 2001 compared to 30 in 2010. And around 600 women are currently registered with the Gas Safe Register, which means they can legally carry out gas work. In April 2009, the figure was around 500. Meanwhile UK Trades Training, based in South Shields, had just one woman turning up for a tiling course in 2004. It now gets up to 30 a year enrolling in training for trades including tiling, plastering, bathroom installation and kitchen fitting. Some womenhave been made redundant from careers as diverse as banking to events managing or have previous been stay at home mothers who have gone on to set up their own companies. The economic downturn persuaded Sue Corentin to turn her love of DIY into a full-time job. The 58-year-old became passionate about it when she single-handedly decorated her parent's home when she was just 18. She started taking her enjoyment of decorating, painting and fixing things around the house seriously when her former husband – who she said 'couldn't even fit a light-bulb' - bought her an expensive tool kit for Christmas. She said: 'I think it was the best present I ever received and that's when I started thinking about doing it as a profession.' But it wasn't until the recession took hold three years ago and she found herself needing to make extra cash quickly that she took her first job at a building company, fixing doors, fitting door-handles and locks. The mother of two from Hayes, Middlesex, said she has been lucky not to experience sexism in the industry, but added that people often find it difficult to get their head around seeing a woman. 'When I started that first job I was working with all men. They couldn't believe it when they first met me and discovered I was a woman. Ms Corentin, whose business is called 'Sue's Home Improvements' said more women should discover DIY. Director Tracy Yorke said: 'Our ladies don't tend to go and work on building sites. They run their own businesses going into domestic homes. 'We've definitely seen an increase in women coming in who've been made redundant and are having to look at other choices and why not? 'We've never found that anything's a barrier for them in the training side of things. 'You don't have to be a great big tradesman to be good at something. I have women coming in who are quite slight but they have no problems in terms of the demands of the courses.' She added: 'Running a business is also about doing a good job and winning the work. If you're going into a domestic market, you don't just get one quote. 'You have to be knowledgeable and be able to interact and make sure you're the right person for the job. Customer service is a massive thing, which women are often very good at.' Sue Jefferson, 35, enrolled on painting, decorating, tiling and plastering courses with the company last year after taking voluntary redundancy from her local government post, organising activities for elderly people. She set up PoppySue's Handy Home Improvement, which provides services including DIY, tiling and plastering in the Darlington area. Her handywoman business is now in great demand.

Supermodel Maggie Rizer went on the offensive against United Airlines on Saturday, claiming that the air carrier first killed her two-year-old golden retriever, and then lied about investigating her death. Rizer said she and her husband were flying from New York City across the country to San Francisco two weeks ago, and they brought their two beloved pets along for the flight. In an interview with PEOPLE, the model insisted that the two-year-old Bea was in perfect health when they placed her in the crate in the underbelly of the plane. Killed: Bea, a two-year-old golden retriever died earlier this month from heatstroke, according to a veterinarian's report, suffered while travelling on a United Airlines flight . But when the couple went to retrieve . the pooch along with their other dog upon arrival in San Francisco, they . were told matter-of-factly by airline officials that Bea was dead. To add insult to injury, Rizer told TMZ that United then lied to her, saying that they sent Bea to a . veterinary to perform a necropsy in order to determine the cause of . death. But the outraged pet owner said that never happened, and the dead dog was left languishing in her crate. Attack: Bea's owner is model Maggie Rizer, who blasted the airline over her pet's death . 'I am so saddened by the complete lack of competence, honestly and compassion that United has shown,' Rizer stated. United Airlines was not immediately available for comment on the allegations. Bea was healthy and prepared for her . flight across the country, according to the doting dog owner who says . she took every precaution to ensure the dog's safety. So when the model, her husband Alex . Mehran and their 10-month-old son Zander landed in San Francisco from . New York earlier this month, the last thing they expected to hear was . that one of their two dogs didn't make it. 'We . drove to the dark cargo terminal and on arrival in the hangar were told . simply, “One of them is dead” by the emotionless worker who seemed more . interested in his text messages,' Maggie wrote in a heated web post on Thursday titled: 'United Airlines Killed Our Golden Retriever.' Having heard stories of pets not surviving flights before - though Bea and her other two dogs Al and Hen have flown previously - the nervous owner says she took every precaution her and her husband could think of to ensure their safety, including a full health examination four days before, as required by United's PetSafe flight program. After a six-hour drive to New York City to avoid a connecting flight that could potentially stress or separate their dogs, she says she paid the airline $1,800 in addition to their plane tickets to ensure their pets' safety as passengers. However, it seems that the airline failed to keep its promises about the dogs. '[The airline] didn't even have an excuse,' she told PEOPLE Magazine this week. After retrieving their dog's body, which they were originally told had already been sent to a local vet for an autopsy, Maggie’s own veterinarian determined that Bea had died from heatstroke. ‘She died 30 feet below us, alone and . scared. Nobody was there to help her because someone made a mistake,’ Maggie told PEOPLE of the dog that had been given to the couple at . their wedding in 2010. Healthy and loved: The golden retriever, seen cuddling with Maggie's husband Alex Mehran, had undergone a health inspection just four days before their flight from New York to San Francisco, California . Family: Bea was one of three dogs belonging to the couple, Al and Hen pictured with them, after gifted at their wedding in 2010 . 'We understand that the loss of a beloved pet is difficult and express our condolences to Ms Rizer and her family for their loss,’ United told PEOPLE in a statement. 'After careful review, we found there were no mechanical operational issues with Bea's flight and also determined she was in a temperature-controlled environment for her entire journey. We would like [to] finalize the review but are unable until we receive a copy of the necropsy.’ 'I am disappointed by United's statement and continued show of disrespect,' Maggie retorted in her own written statement on her Facebook page on Thursday. Despite her anger the model, married to an IBM heir, writes that she doesn't plan to file a lawsuit or become . an advocate against the airline. Stern warning: Bea is seen snoozing in Maggie's home in an earlier taken photo, with the heartbroken owner now warning pet owners about flying with their pets . 'I am writing this to help make people aware that airlines are incapable of ensuring the safety of our pets. All it takes is for one employee to not follow the proper procedure and then like me, your dog is dead.' Responding to condolences on her Facebook page this week, Maggie showed her appreciation for her compassionate friends and fans. 'Thank you for the kind thoughts. She was an amazing dog with a heart of gold. So incredibly happy and sweet, so lovable. We still cannot believe she is gone. She will be missed more then I can express. My heart is broken and forever changed.'","Bea, the couple's two-year-old dog, died of heatstroke while aboard the United flight according to an autopsy report .

Devastated: Father Garry Mackay, mother Wendy MacDonald and their daughter Callie Mackay pictured at the funeral of five-year-old Grace Mackay . A father who survived a canoeing accident in which his youngest daughter, best friend and two boys died has broken his silence about the tragedy. Garry Mackay said he did everything he could to save lives but had to make ‘the hardest decision of his life’ to leave his children in the water with a friend and his family in Loch Gairloch to swim to shore and raise the alarm. Mr Mackay was speaking after the  accident near Gairloch, Wester Ross, on August 26 in which his five-year-old daughter Grace, friend Ewen Beaton, 32, of Beauly, Inverness-shire, and his sons Ewen, five, and two-year-old Jamie died. Mr Mackay said he did not realise the youngsters were only wearing buoyancy aids and not life jackets and added that he had believed that, even in cold waters, ‘they would be OK’. The group, including Mr Mackay’s eight-year-old daughter Callie, had taken Mr Beaton’s recently acquired Canadian canoe out to sea before eventually going to deeper water where they could fish between the mainland and Longa Island. Mr Mackay, of Muir of Ord, Inverness-shire, said that as they paddled they were chatting happily about dolphins, basking sharks and killer whales. But in a split second the canoe capsized and all six were suddenly fighting for their lives. Mr Mackay had caught mackerel and went to put them in a box. He said: ‘I stood up and turned around and the boat tilted four of five inches from the water before righting itself. ‘I went to put a fish in the box and the boat tilted the other way to the side where Ewen was bringing up more fish, and almost in slow motion it capsized.’ Panic ensued and Mr Beaton was screaming ‘Help’. Mr Mackay said: ‘I thought, we will hold onto the boat and someone will  rescue us.’ However, the boat sank, leaving the six stranded. Mr Mackay said he is unsure about what happened next but he saw Mr Beaton swim a few feet before he went under. Loss: Five-year-old Grace Mackay (right), pictured with her sister Callie, was rescued from the water after the canoe capsized but died in hospital . Tragic brothers: Ewen Beaton, five, and his younger brother Jamie, two, were pulled out of the water at Loch Gairloch and airlifted to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but later died . He said Mr Beaton resurfaced and shouted at his sons to let go of him. Mr Mackay added: ‘Ewen said “I’ve let go” and I knew that was him away.’ Mr Mackay set off, leaving Ewen Jnr holding onto his brother Jamie, who was conscious. Mr Mackay had no life jacket and, with no one in sight, he made the decision to swim for shore. He said: ‘It was the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make but I knew if I stayed I would drown too, and the kids would never be found. ‘I turned to Gracie first. I will always remember her scared little face. I told her, “You have to bob in the water like Callie”.’ He added: ‘I believed the children were wearing life jackets. I thought that if I got help they would be OK because although their bodies slow down with the cold, children can survive for quite a long time at sea. The family day out ended in tragedy when the canoe overturned and Grace, pictured, was found floating in the water . ‘I didn’t realise they were only wearing buoyancy aids which don’t keep your head out of water if you lose consciousness.’ Once ashore, Mr Mackay ran a mile in bare feet to seek help before being reunited with Callie, who had also swum ashore. Mr Beaton’s sons were airlifted to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but lost their fight for life, while Grace, who had been found face down, was taken to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow. The following day, doctors told Mr Mackay and his partner Wendy MacDonald there was nothing more they could do. He said: ‘She was so kind and caring. And that’s what makes it so hard – I haven’t had a clean past, I have done things I’m not proud of, but she was perfect.’ He admitted he fears others may judge him about what happened on that day. He said: ‘As far as what happened, my conscience is clear. I did everything I could.’ Mr Mackay now wants to set up a memorial to honour the five and he wants to highlight the difference between buoyancy aids and life jackets so similar tragedies can be averted. LochWatch Loch Awe, a volunteer group formed after the 2009 incident in which four Glasgow fishermen drowned on the Argyll loch, has called for new laws to make wearing life jackets compulsory. A fatal accident inquiry into the tragedy heard that if the men had been wearing properly functioning life jackets they might have survived. Les Currie, 60, father of Craig Currie, one of  the four men who died, said: ‘It has to be the Scottish Government that does something because we are talking about Scottish waters.

On the look out: Two coastguard workers were . among many who combed the beach at Loch Gairloch and the rocky coastline . for the missing man . ‘They are coming out with lots of silly laws, but this is a law that will save lives.’ LochWatch Loch Awe is being supported in its call for a compulsory life jacket law by Argyll and Bute Nationalist MSP Michael Russell. He said: ‘You wouldn’t get in a car without wearing a seatbelt, so why would you get in a boat without a life jacket? ‘I am taking the Loch Awe message to  Holyrood and will be asking the Community Safety Minister to meet LochWatch Loch Awe.’","Garry Mackay took his two daughters for a day out on a canoe with a close friend and his two sons .

Police are still hunting for a prominent trauma surgeon they believe shot his ex-girlfriend to death at point-blank range at the hospital where they both worked. Timothy V. Jorden Jr, a 49-year-old former Army medic and weapons expert, has eluded authorities since the shooting at the Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo, New York on Wednesday morning. The victim Jacqueline Wisniewski, 33, worked as a receptionist at the hospital and was described as a 'one-time girlfriend'. She has a young son and was training to be a nurse. Jorden allegedly lured his ex-girlfriend . to a stairwell in the hospital, where he then shot her multiple times . at blank-point range in the head and upper body. Search: Police are hunting for prominent surgeon Timothy V. Jorden Jr. in connection with the fatal shooting of 33-year-old Jacqueline Wisniewski (right) Witnesses reported hearing four shots just after 8am. Ms Wisniewski's body was found in a covered passageway connecting the Kidney Center and another wing of the hospital. Friends of the woman, who was looking forward to celebrating her young son's graduation from pre-K on Thursday, told the Buffalo News that she had lived in fear of her ex-boyfriend. 'She told me, ""I'm scared"",' her friend, Heather Shipley, said. 'She said: ""If anything happens to me, you know who did it"".' Shipley added that Wisniewski had lived with Jorden but left him as she believed he was having affairs with other women. When they broke up, he refused to move on. Wisniewski said the surgeon had put a GPS tracking device in her car to keep track of her movements. After she discovered the device, she filed a police report, Shipley said. On another occasion, he held her . captive in her home for a day and a half, brandishing a knife, the . friend said. He also once gave her a black eye, she said. Hunt: The hospital went into lock down as officers - on the ground and in the air - searched for the gunman . Lockdown: SWAT teams swarmed the 65-acre campus but the gunman has not yet been found . 'He threatened to kill her a couple . of times,' Shipley added. 'But I think in her mind she wouldn't believe . it would actually happen.' Wisniewski's boss at ECMC's Adolescent Psychiatric Unit, Dori R. Marshall, said the woman had told her she was in an abusive situation with a physician, but did not name him. 'Person of interest': Surgeon Timothy Jorden was said to have been suffering from emotional problems . The shooting prompted a four-hour . lockdown of the hospital, as SWAT teams and K-9 units swarmed the campus . in an attempt to corner the killer. Police believe Jorden, who they have . named as a 'person of interest', could be 'special weapons trained' from . his time in the Army. Authorities . blocked a road leading to Jorden's home in an isolated area of private . Lake View residences near the Lake Erie shore. Officers . obtained a warrant and used specialized robotic devices to . enter and search the home. But hours later, they determined he was not inside. SWAT team members in camouflage . arrived in unmarked SUVs and say he may be armed and dangerous. While many have described him as a popular surgeon, sources told the Buffalo News that he has recently suffered some emotional problems. It is believed he had recently lost 75 pounds. 'He might have been having mental health issues,' a police official told the News. Another official suggested he might have 'some type of serious physical ailment that caused the drastic weight loss'. Sources added that it appeared the man had been living in his office as food containers and dirty laundry were found in the ceiling. Neighbours added that he appeared to start losing the weight around three months ago, and they saw him at the home less frequently. Law enforcement: Authorities, who also swarmed Jorden's home, said the shooting was 'not a random act' Police presence: Officers hand out photographs of Jorden, who is a 'person of interest' in the crime . Officials said as many as 400 patients and about half of the hospital's 2,000 employees were on the grounds at the time. 'The . SWAT Team is in control of the situation,' Buffalo police spokesman . Michael J. DeGeorge said during a news conference after the shooting. 'It is an active situation.' The hospital also diverted emergency room patients to Buffalo General Hospital but most of the campus re-opened at 2 p.m. 'Normally this is very safe,' hospital volunteer Lois Peterson told the Buffalo News. 'I've . volunteered here for 42 years. But this is tragic.' Police described Jorden as a bald, . black male, about 6ft 2 and 250 pounds, and showed his photograph at . check points in the search for tips. Authorities also described the four vehicles - two GMC Sierra pickups, a Cadillac and a Chevrolet Cobalt - registered in his name. After completing high school, Jorden . joined the Army and served with the Army's Special Forces, as a weapons . expert then as a medic. His military career spanned 18 years and he served in the Caribbean, Japan and Korea. Patrol: Staff and patients were refused entry to the hospital over a four-hour period . He earned numerous medals including . the Army Achievement Medal, Army Commendation Medal and Master Parachute . Badge Scuba Diver Badge Special Forces Tab, ABC reported. Francisca Wellsbury, who was married to Jorden before they divorce, told ABC she was shocked her former husband was the suspect. 'We've lived separate lives for a long time,' Wellsbury, who lives on the West Coast, said. 'I'm just as shocked as anyone. It's traumatic.' She added: 'This is not the person I knew. I wish he would seek help.' Jorden has been licensed to practice . medicine in New York since 2002 and treats patients at the medical . center and other major hospitals in the area. 'I've wanted to be a doctor since early in my military career as a medic,' Jorden told the Buffalo News in a 1996 profile, which featured pictures of his wife and their son. He received his certification from . the American Board of Surgery in 2004. There are no legal actions . against his license and he has no criminal background.","Jacqueline Wisniewski, 33, lured into stairwell and shot at point-blank range .

Devastated: Damien Hirst's partner may have left him for an older man only last month, but the artist put a brave face on his heartache when he was pictured with symbolic artwork today . It was only a few days ago that details had emerged of Damien Hirst's split from his partner of 20 years after she left him for a former mercenary. But in the face of his relationship breakdown, the world's richest artist has put a brave face on his personal troubles, as he was pictured today going back to the day job and holding a particularly symbolic artwork. Hirst, who has a £215m fortune, was left devastated last month when Maia Norman, his partner of 19 years, confessed her affair with former Lieutenant Colonel Tim Spicer. But the 47-year-old artist appeared . focussed on his work in London's Covent Garden at a Tate Modern Art . Project today, despite at one point holding up a painting of a giant . bright red heart. The details of Hirst's relationship . breakdown with Norman were revealed on Sunday, after the couple broke . news of their split to friends and confidants. In the wake of the revelations, it . emerged that Hirst went ahead with a party in the grounds of one of his . country homes only hours after news broke that his partner Maia Norman . had left him for Mr Tim Spicer. Fans expressed their sympathy to Hirst . after Miss Norman confirmed she was leaving him after 19 years for . former soldier-of-fortune Spicer, who is 12 years older than the artist, . who is the father of Norman's three children. It is unclear whether Norman will now move out of the couple’s main home, a 300-year-old Grade II listed farmhouse in Devon. A fortnight ago, she grinned as she . greeted 59-year-old Spicer, a former Lieutenant Colonel in the Scots . Guards who now runs Aegis Defence Services, a security firm that has won . multi-million-pound contracts with the US government in Iraq and . Afghanistan. Striking a pose: The world's richest artist appeared in good spirits when he was pictured with the heart design painting in London today . Details of Hirst's split from Maia Norman emerged last weekend, with the break-up thought to have happened last month . Smiling for the camera: Hirst poses with schoolchildren with his heart spin painting, as part of a Tate Modern Art Project in Covent Garden . Two weeks ago, California-born Miss . Norman, 49, was photographed in Hollywood tenderly kissing Spicer in . front of 150 journalists attending a car rally. She embraced her lover for a second time before the pair walked arm-in-arm into a hotel lobby. An onlooker said: ‘They looked . incredibly comfortable and happy to see each other. You got the feeling . this was the real thing, not just a fling.’ When approached and asked whether she was leaving Hirst for Spicer, Miss Norman said ‘yes’ before declining to speak further. Divorced Spicer, the father of a . teenage son, remained silent, although yesterday a spokesman confirmed . he did not deny the story. Spicer, 59, is a former Lieutenant . Colonel in the Scots Guards and a Falklands veteran. He came to . prominence through his company Sandline during the ‘arms-to-Africa’ controversy in 1998. He now runs Aegis Defence Services, a security firm . that has won multi-million-pound contracts with the US government in . Iraq and Afghanistan. For his part, Leeds-born Hirst is the . most successful living artist. His controversial works, which include a . dead shark encased in formaldehyde and a skull made from diamonds, have . helped him earn what is believed to be a £215million fortune. Item: California-born Maia Norman leapt out of her black Dodge Charger - complete with Hirst's skull design on the side - to passionately embrace debonair Tim Spicer, a former mercenary . One onlooker said: 'They looked incredibly comfortable and happy to see each other. You got the feeling this was the real thing, not just a fling.' Last night, however, lawyers said Miss . Norman might be entitled to very little of that money because the . couple – whose children are aged 16, 12 and six – never married. Ayesha Vardag, of London solicitors . Vardags, said: ‘They are not married and, in England, the rights of . cohabitees are extremely limited, even if they have been in a . relationship for a long time and even if they have three children. ‘It all depends on whether they have a . joint bank account and if her name is on the title deeds of the various . properties. If not, she could be entitled to very little for herself.’ As well as the 300-year-old Grade . II-listed Devon farmhouse, which is the main family home, Hirst also . owns a restaurant, a pub and an art studio. Bond and Hirst bonded over their mutual lack of a father figure and humble beginnings. She initially worked as his assistant. One of Hirst's best-known works is a diamond-studded human skull that sold for £50 million . In 2005, he paid £3million for . Toddington Manor, a gothic pile in Gloucestershire that he is renovating . to house his art collection, and he also owns a house in Thailand, a . beach home in Mexico and a houseboat moored on the Thames in Chelsea. Although they never married, Hirst and . Miss Norman used to refer to each other as husband and wife, and their . relationship was seen as one of the art world’s most stable. Sources stressed their main priority now was the welfare of their children. It is not known how Spicer came to . know Miss Norman but neighbours in Devon have speculated he could have . helped to arrange the security guards who monitor the entrance to . Hirst’s home.

Francine Austin, 54, ploughed her Audi convertible into Brenda Wilson, 62, killing the primary school teacher instantly. She also hit Deirdre McFadden, 48, who was walking her dog with Mrs Wilson, after her car left the road and 'headed directly towards the pavement'. Spared jail: Francine Austin (left) ploughed her Audi convertible into Brenda Wilson, 62, killing the primary school teacher instantly . Mrs McFadden escaped with arm injuries. Her dog was killed. Austin, whose ex-husband David runs David Austin Roses, admitted causing death by careless driving while over the legal alcohol limit. Judge John Maxwell said he would have normally sentenced her to a three-year prison term. But despite 'considerable reservations' he felt he had 'no alternative' but to make an indeterminate hospital order, based on psychiatric reports. The decision to spare Austin jail was greeted with outrage by Mrs Wilson's family. Speaking outside the court, Mrs Wilson's son Edward Davies said the sentence was an 'absolute disgrace'. He added: 'She's got submissions from two psychiatrists saying that she shouldn't go to prison, we dispute what they're saying. 'I think she should serve the full . prison sentence after the doctors let her out, but she'll probably only . do a year in the hospital and be let out.

But she was still more than one and a half times the legal alcohol limit when she crashed on the way back. Mrs Wilson was walking with Mrs McFadden, and her dog on a pavement beside the country road at Stourton, South Staffordshire. Robert Price, prosecuting, said: 'A . witness noticed that the Audi was travelling up its correct side of the . road but didn't appear to be travelling the natural course of road. 'He believed that there was something . wrong with the way in which the car was being manoeuvred.

He added: 'She is ill, and as with any . offender before any court they have to be dealt with within the regime . that relates to that.' Austin was sent to the independent . Woodbourne Priory hospital in Birmingham, which specialises in treating . mental health problems. Judge Maxwell told her: 'The position is that . you should not go to prison but that you should be detained in a mental . hospital. 'I have considerable reservations . about that because you are mentally ill but I look at the trauma other . people have suffered and I don't know that makes them mentally ill. 'Why should your mental suffering make so much difference to  the case? 'You do not deserve leniency, but I feel I really have no alternative but to make a hospital order.'

Lancashire, who is was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, had been playing a violent video game and also smoked cannabis and taken ‘bubble’ – a street nickname for mephedrone - on the night he fatally . knifed Neil Ryan, 46, and injured his mother Deborah, 41. The 19-year-old TA soldier was made subject of an indefinite . hospital order after he pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of . diminished responsibility in what the serving judge called the 'saddest . case' in his time at Preston Crown Court. Tragedy: Jordan Ryan, centre, with his parents Neil and Deborah whom he attacked with a kitchen knife last autumn after smoking cannabis and taking mephedrone . Jordan fatally stabbed his father Neil in the neck after his parents had allowed him in their bed in a bid to calm him down after he had run away from home complaining about 'voices'. He then turned the knife on his mother - claiming the ‘voices in his head’ told him do it. Police were called to the house of horror in Blackburn, Lancshire to find Mr Ryan, a chief steward at a St Paul's Working Men's Club in Blackburn, already dead at the scene. Mrs Ryan was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital for stab injuries to her breast area but recovered following emergency surgery. Today . she attended Preston Crown Court with friends and family to support her . mentally disturbed son as he was ordered to be kept in a secure mental . health facility. Support: Jordan's mother Deborah attended Preston Crown Court today alongside family and friends to show their support for the teen . His not guilty plea to murdering his father was accepted and a charge of attempted murder upon Mrs Ryan was allowed to lie on file after she said she would not testify against her son. In a statement she said: 'Whilst I grieve for a wonderful husband and soulmate, I also pine for my son who I long to be at home, The pain is heart breaking.’ Mr and Mrs Ryan had been married for 19 years and had a younger son who was not at home at the time of the attack. In Mrs Ryan’s statement she pledged her ‘unconditional love’ to her son and also said the family had always believed that Jordan was not responsible for his actions during the attack and that the family will continue to support him throughout his recovery. She added: ‘Neil's loss was devastating enough but Jordan's illness and detainment has been just as traumatic for us all. ‘As a family we need to try and rebuild our lives and continue to support Jordan who is also grieving the loss of his father.’ Although . described as a typical teenager who was not known for violence or . aggression Jordan, who had been studying a joinery and carpentry course . at Blackburn, had recently become obsessed with violent video games and . military shows – even joining the local Territorial Army. The tragedy occurred last October . after Jordan spent the evening smoking cannabis and playing a violent . video game with one of his pals. The following day he was found walking . along the road by his grandparents and saying he was ‘hearing voices.’ The . youngster was taken home but could not settle and as his parents . comforted him in their bedroom they noticed his ‘altering behaviour . between laughing and tears, shivering and feeling clammy.’ At 5.50am, before he attacked his parents, Ryan dialled 999 and asked for an ambulance. ‘He . informed an operator that someone had broken into the house and that . his father had been stabbed in the stomach,’ said Mr Lasker. ‘In fact, there had been no violence at all. These details were completely false.’ A police patrol was sent to the house and a search of Ryan confirmed he had no weapons on him. Police outside the Ryan family home in Blackburn after the then 18-year-old Jordan Ryan attacked his parents Neil and Deborah in October last year . The youngster then got into the bed of his parents where, the court heard, Mrs Ryan had urged . her husband to try and get some sleep and that her son was lying behind . her husband when Jordan stabbed him in the neck without any prior . warning. Mrs Ryan . immediately dialled emergency services but Mr Lasker told the court that . by the time the 999 call was picked up at 7.50am she too had been . stabbed. Jordan, who left . the house before emergency services arrived, later turned up at his . grandparents home asking for a change of clothes and a photograph of his . parents which he could ‘take to prison.’ He said, 'I'm sorry grandma, I . didn't want to but they told me to do it. ‘ .

Suicide: Robert McKeon, the founder and chairman of Veritas Capital, committed suicide on Monday . One of America’s most highly respected private equity bosses has been found dead after he apparently killed himself, leaving those on Wall Street and beyond asking why. The death of Robert McKeon, who was in charge of Veritas Capital, was ruled a suicide by a coroner who revealed that the cause of death was ‘asphyxia due to neck compression’. McKeon's body was discovered at his $5m mansion in Darien, Connecticut, where he lived with his art expert wife and their children. Mr McKeon, 58, was a well known figure on Wall St who managed the $2bn Veritas fund. He was also a passionate art collector and a philanthropist who supported a number of charities, including the New York Police & Fire Widows & Children's Benefit Fund. In a statement Veritas said: ‘Bob was an extraordinary person, a consummate professional, and a cherished friend and colleague. ‘We are all deeply saddened by this tragic loss and have his family in our thoughts.’ Mr McKeon was born to a working class family in the Bronx, and was the son of a cake deliveryman. He went to Fordham University and Harvard Business School before joining now shuttered investment bank First Boston. He helped found Wasserstein Perella & Co. in 1988 as head of private equity and then later chairman - the company’s successes included turning around cosmetics firm Maybelline. Family man: McKeon was married to Clare, an Oxford graduate who works at Christie's in New York . In 1992, he and legendary Wall St . colleagues Joseph Perella and the late Bruce Wasserstein then founded . Veritas - with Mr McKeon only in his 30s at the time. In . a profile Crain’s Business said it would be surprised if the . ‘boyish-looking’ financier ‘will ever be one of those archetypal, . ruthless corporate raiders everybody loves to hate.’ Veritas went on to buy stakes in military and defence companies like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, but it was not without controversy. Mr McKeon has been described as a hard-nosed ‘corporate cleaner’ which means he took over troubled companies, removed them from the stock market and implemented painful cuts to make them profitable. In 1999, a Veritas consultant admitted paying off an official in Connecticut so the company would get approval for an $125million investment. Despite requests to refund the investment, Mr McKeon refused. Veritas: In 1992, McKeon and legendary Wall St colleagues Joseph Perella and the late Bruce Wasserstein founded Veritas - with Mr McKeon only in his 30s at the time . Veritas bought defence contractor DynCorp even though it had been linked to a sex trafficking scheme in the 1990s. It also purchased MZM Inc, a military contractor which was probed by federal investigators over . But, as the New York Observer reported, McKeon acquired each of the respective companies after their scandals had subsided. Now an extremely wealthy man, Mr McKeon’s 1929 Connecticut home is a five-bedroom, six bathroom mansion set on three acres. He is also thought to have properties in The Hamptons and Telluride, Colorado. His wife Clare works at Christie’s in New York where she is an expert on 20th Century British Art and Victorian & British Impressionist Pictures. A graduate of Oxford University and the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, she is also Vice President in the Department of Sporting Art. In a statement Darien Police said that the death was not being treated as suspicious. A spokesman said: ‘The incident is under investigation pending the results of the scheduled autopsy.’","Robert McKeon, the boss of Veritas Capital, committed suicide on Monday .

Horrific injuries: Mark Laird, 28, was blasted by a shotgun on his back and arm by his friend Murray Gracie, 18. 22 shotgun pellets had to be picked out of his back . A 'shotgun-mad' teenager blasted his friend on his doorstep in an unprovoked attack. Murray Gracie, 18, shot Mark Laird as the victim’s partner and seven-month old daughter were inside his property in Carluke, Lanarkshire in Scotland. Gracie then went on to fire at the home of his ex-girlfriend before chasing after terrified police officers with his double barreled shotgun. His rampage ended after firearms officers followed him to a retail park during an eight-mile pursuit. Gracie - who was on probation at the time - appeared at the High Court in Glasgow where he admitted to a string of charges including assault and other gun-related offences. Prosecutor Kath Harper told how, as far back as March 2010, Gracie had spoken about getting hold of a gun and shooting at police. He later had 'on-going pre-occupying thoughts' of sourcing a firearm. The court heard how electrician Mr Laird was shot outside his family home on January 8 this year. Gracie had texted his friend earlier that evening to ask where he was and Mr Laird said he was in his house. Around 11.20pm, the 28 year-old dad was outside having a cigarette when he heard a car and then saw Gracie walking towards him. Mr Laird said: 'What’s happening, Murray?' Gracie replied: 'I don’t know - what is happening?' Mr Laird then spotted the teenager was armed with a sawn off double-barreled shotgun. He quickly turned back towards his front door before hearing a loud bang and then feeling a searing pain in his body. Miss Harper said: 'The noise was heard by a number of witnesses in his houses nearby and by Mr Laird’s partner Emma Donnelly who was woken from her sleep.' Gracie fled in his car while Mr Laird managed to alert his girlfriend that he had been shot. Police nearby heard the gun blast and arrived to find the injured victim in the hallway of his house. Painful: The gunshot wounds to Laird's arm, left, where he had to have multiple stitches and the father, right, in bandages following the brutal attack . The victim, left, shows his arm in bandages and right, his back, where medics pulled out 22 gunshot pellets . The dad was rushed to hospital, where a total of 22 shotgun pellets were picked out of his back. Gracie meantime drove to the nearby home of his ex-partner Laura Donnelly - the sister of Mr Laird’s girlfriend. The couple had split months earlier after a falling out. Miss Donnelly had grown fearful of Gracie after he had become 'increasingly obsessive' about her. Miss Donnelly was going to her bed around midnight on January 8 when she ended up covered in broken glass following another loud bang. Her family heard her screams before noticing Gracie fleeing the scene. Police also soon arrived there and spoke to Gracie who had contacted Miss Donnelly’s brother. One officer asked was he fine and a laughing Gracie replied: 'Mate, I’m listening to f****** (singer) Jack Johnson - do I sound like I am alright?' Crime scene: The glass door of Laird's home in Carluke, Lanarkshire, can be seen boarded up after the shooting . Laird with his fiancee Emma Donnelly on holiday before the shooting which left him with horrific injuries . The court heard a total of 16 fired pellets were discovered in the hallway. Around 1am, other officers on the hunt for Gracie spotted him getting out of his car and running at their vehicle with the shotgun. The constables reversed at speed while Gracie returned to his motor and sped after them. A firearms unit was alerted to the drama and they followed Gracie until he eventually stopped his car at a retail park in Hamilton, Lanarkshire. The shotgun was found in his vehicle. Gracie - who was wearing body armour - claimed he would have fired more shots had the barrel of the weapon not been broken. His family home was later searched and a bullet cartridge was discovered inside a toy car while a similar item was discovered in his bedroom and the garage. Advocate depute Miss Harper said it was accepted that Gracie’s family were unaware of any gun-related equipment being stored at the property. The court was told Mr Laird required surgery for injuries that were potentially life-threatening. Medics said he could have suffered a fatal infection had he not been treated in time. Gracie admitted to the charges at the high court on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Miss Harper said Gracie had a history of mental illness and that his actions at the time were affected by “an abnormality of mind”. Judge Lady Stacey imposed an interim compulsion order for the teenager to remain at The State Hospital in Carstairs. Gracie will return to the dock in December.","Murray Gracie, 18, fired at father Mark Laird with double barreled shot gun .

Back in jail: Joseph Green Brown, 62, is being held over the murder of his wife Mamie in North Carolina last week after he was released from death row in 1987 . A former death row inmate who became a spokesman against the death penalty has been arrested again over the alleged murder of his wife. Joseph Brown was held after Mamie, his wife of 20 years, was found dead in her apartment on Thursday. He now faces the death penalty for the second time if convicted of the crime which has left both their families in shock. Officers found the 71-year-old woman lying on the floor suffering from apparent trauma. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Brown was released from death row in 1987 for a wrongful rape and murder conviction and spent his life campaigning for reform of the penal system. He found God, took the name Shabaka and frequently spoke out against the finality of the death penalty, including a passionate speech to a Congressional Judiciary subcommittee. Prominent lawyers involved in his case also changed their minds about capital punishment due to his pleas. In one interview Brown said: ‘I’m against killing, period, whether the violence is by individuals, the state, or armies in warfare. All life is sacred.’ The body of Mrs Brown, 71, was discovered after police were asked to check on her. Her husband was arrested late on Friday at a hotel in Charleston, South Carolina. Back on death row: Joseph Green Brown, right, is again on death row for the alleged murder of his wife of 20 years, 71-year-old Mamie Caldwell Brown, left, was found dead last week . Discovery: Mamie Brown, 71, was found dead at her apartment in North Carolina after having suffered trauma, according to police . During his first court appearance in . Charlotte, North Carolina, he was escorted into a courtroom in . handcuffs. Wearing an orange prison jump suit, he glimpsed at his wife’s . family in the courtroom, but quickly turned away. A daughter of the victim could be heard saying: ‘Oh my god!’ Marcus Williams, Mrs Brown’s cousin, . said: ‘We thought they were happy. He didn’t seem like a threat. He was . upfront about everything. He was always smiling and trying to help . people.' Mr Williams added: ‘He was a motivational speaker. He liked to warn people what could happen in the legal system’. Brown’s 1974 conviction and death . sentence by a Florida jury was for raping and murdering Earlene Treva . Barksdale, the owner of a clothing store. He was scheduled for execution October  17, 1983, but a federal judge ordered a stay 15 hours before he was to be put to death. Mrs Barksdale, 34, a mother of five, . was found shot in the head at the children's clothing store she owned on . July 7, 1973 by her husband Fred, according to an article by Cltampa.com . Her . husband was considered the prime suspect for around five days before he . passed a lie detector test and attention shifted to Joseph Brown. Brown, at the time a 23-year-old . drifter from South Carolina, had just confessed to a motel robbery where . he sexually abused a female guest near Tampa airport on the same . day. He denied knowing anything about Mrs Barksdale's death. Brown was convicted of her murder the . following year and spent 13 years on death row before charges were . dropped just 15 hours before his execution. He was released on March 5, 1987 after an appeals court found that prosecution had allowed testimony at trial they knew to be false. One witness had struck a deal with the prosecution and falsely told the court that he and Brown had committed a robbery together. Grisly: Joseph Green Brown had been convicted of the rape and murder of Earlene Barksdale in 1973 but was released from death row . In a 1997 interview with America magazine about his experiences on death row, Brown said: 'Overall, it took me almost five years to decompress from the experience on death row. 'Some people couldn't believe I was still alive.' Among those who campaigned for Brown the first time around was Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut based lawyer who is now a Senator for the state. He worked the case pro bono and even put in $40,000 of his own money - despite supporting the death penalty. He declined to comment on Brown’s latest arrest. Some $400,000 of money for Brown’s defence was also provided by black rights campaigners the NAACP because they believed it was a racially-linked injustice. North Carolina, where Brown will face justice this time, has the death penalty for capitol felonies, of which first degree murder is one. The last execution in the state was Samuel Flippen in 2006 who beat his two-year-old stepdaughter to death.","Joseph Brown, 62, being held without bond over murder of wife Mamie, 71 .

"By . Richard Shears . PUBLISHED: . 06:56 EST, 17 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:34 EST, 17 September 2012 . A police officer told today how a shark guided him to a rescue boat after he had drifted helplessly in the Pacific Ocean for 15 weeks. Mr Toakai Teitoi’s brother-in-law had perished from dehydration and the 41-year-old policeman knew it was only a matter of time before he, too, succumbed to the elements. But he said today that two unexpected events led to his eventual rescue – a tropical downpour that provided him with drinking water and the extraordinary encounter with the shark. Trouble in paradise: Mr Teitoi and his brother-in-law were travelling from the Kritibati capital to their home on a nearby atoll when their boat went adrift . ‘Just as I was giving up all hope of being rescued after one boat had passed me by in the distance something very strange happened,’ Mr Teitoi said after being brought ashore in the Marshall Islands by the fishing boat which found him. ‘I was cowering from the sun under a piece of cloth I had stretched across the front of the boat when I felt a big bump, followed by some scratching. ‘I looked over the side and saw a six-foot shark circling my boat, but it was mainly bumping against the hull. ‘It definitely caught my attention because I had been fast asleep. Then, because I was now awake, I looked around me and saw the stern of a ship. ‘I couldn’t believe my eyes. I could just make out the crew who were looking at me through binoculars. Shark rescue: Mr Teitoi say he was saved by a shark who alerted him to a nearby rescue boat by bumping into his vessel when he had fallen asleep . ‘Of course I was able to wave frantically at them and they came and picked me up. If that shark hadn’t nudged me awake the crew of the boat might have thought I wasn’t in trouble and might have carried on sailing past me.’ Mr Teitoi told his extraordinary story after being treated for exhaustion and dehydration in Majuro in the Marshall Islands. He and his brother-in-law had flown from their home on the island of Maiana to the Kiribati capital of Tarawa so that Mr Teitoi could be sworn in as a policeman. By a curious coincidence, following the swearing-in ceremony, he watched a film depicting a true story about four men from Kiribati who had been lost at sea, with only two surviving after they were washed ashore in American Samoa six weeks later. When it was time for Mr Teito and his brother-in-law, Ielu Falaile, 52, to return to their home they boarded a 15ft wooden boat for what should have been a two hour voyage. They stopped to fish along the way and then dozed off – and when they awoke they found they had drifted out of sight of Maiana. Soon afterwards, they ran out of fuel. ‘We had plenty of food and we could catch fish, but the problem was there was nothing to drink,’ said Mr Teito. As the two men began to suffer from dehydration, Mr Teitoi turned to prayer, but his brother-in-law just lay in the boat. After five weeks adrift, Mr Falaile died. 'I left him there overnight and slept next to him, like at a funeral,' said Mr Teitoi. In the morning, he lowered the body of his brother-in-law over the side. Just 24 hours later, life-giving rains fell during a storm – rains that fell for several days – and Mr Teito was able to fill two five gallon containers of water. 'There were two choices in my mind at the time. Either someone would find me or I would follow my brother-in-law in death. I was running out of water. It was out of my control,' he said. He prayed every morning and several weeks later he caught sight of a fishing boat, but the crew failed to see him. So he continued praying, drinking water and eating raw fish he was able to catch, doing his best to keep out of the tropical sun by sleeping under the cloth awning he had erected. Weeks went by – and then came that bump. The bump of a shark which woke him and alerted him to a boat that was close enough to see his frantic waving for help. Shortly before leaving Majuro today, Mr Teitoi said: ‘I’m flying home. I’ll never go by boat again.’","Toakai Teitoi's brother-in-law perished at sea near Kiribati .

A 15-year-old boy told a court that he’s not making up affair with his French teacher because he knows she had breast implants and other intimate details about the 42-year-old mother. The boy testified to the Toronto court that he was not making his story up and that his former French teacher Mary Gowans told him about her decision to get breast implants. ‘Where did the teen hear that? She never told anyone she had breast implants,' attorney Soula Olver said. Shocked: Gowans, pictured outside court, said that a few days later police turned up to arrest her . Testifying in her own defense at a Toronto court, Gowans, 42, denied they had ever had a romance and claimed the teenager, now 18, had kissed and grabbed her crotch in January 2010. He has accused his former French teacher of a number of intimate encounters, including exposing her breasts to him, after favouring him as one of her students at Joseph Howe Sr. Public School. But defense lawyers have claimed it was he who took a liking to his teacher, who has since lost her job and separated from her husband of 17 years, and eventually became 'obsessed' with her. The Toronto Sun reports Gowan's lawyer painted a different picture of the boy, who she described as 'assertive, confident and to an extent, arrogant'. Speaking to the court, Gowans recounted how her son and daughter were playing hide-and-seek at the home when she leaned in to the teen to reveal where her son was hiding. But he kissed her on the lips and grabbed her crotch, to her surprise, she said. Student's pet: Mary Gowans, 42, has denied having a string of sexual encounters with a 15-year-old student and said she was stunned when he made a move at her while he was babysitting her children . In court: She added that she took him home immediately and said he could not return to the house again . 'It took a second to realize what was . going on. Then, I pushed him back and said, ""What are you doing? Stop!""' she said, according to the Toronto Sun. 'He looked a little shocked and I was . extremely shocked. This was right out of the blue for me. I had . absolutely no idea this was coming. I felt he had taken advantage of my . kindness.' She said she gathered herself and then . told her children they were driving the boy home. The next day, after . coaching the boy in hockey practice, she told him he would never return . to her home. 'It never occurred to me to report him to the police. I thought the consequences like that didn’t seem fitting,' she said. 'My children loved him and it was hurtful when I heard (his testimony that) he didn’t care for them,' said Gowans. Accusations: The teenager, now 18, told the court they had at least four sexual encounters after his teacher took a liking to him. He admitted he had had sexual fantasies about her . In the dock: Gowans said he had become a member of the family and they regularly exchanged texts . 'I considered him like a member of our family.' They sent text messages to each other . in the week afterwards and he repeatedly apologised and said he was . worried she would tell his parents, she said. A communications company testified on . Thursday that Gowans and the boy exchanged 2,218 text messages over a . year beginning in February 2009. A few days later, police knocked on her door and she was arrested with her children looking on. 'I couldn’t believe what was happening,' she told the court, the Toronto Star reported. Scene: She taught the boy French at Joseph Howe Sr. Public School in Toronto. She has since lost her job . The teen, who was 15 at the time of . the relationship and is now an 18-year-old at college, testified earlier . in the case that they engaged in four to six sex-play sessions . involving kissing and touching between November 2009 and January 2010. He said she allowed him to place a . hand on her private parts on two separate occasions but she stopped him, . saying it felt wrong. Yet Gowans contested it had not happened, and said she was as friendly with the boy as she was with her other students. The teen, who admitted he had had . sexual fantasies about his teacher, had also claimed she showed him her . breasts through a wet T-shirt, but she claimed he started the incident . by suddenly spraying her with water.

There are plants growing out of cracks in the brickwork, the window frames are covered in dirt and the scaffolding forces wheelchair users off the pavement and into oncoming traffic. But this dilapidated building has not fallen into disrepair because of cowboy builders or an unscrupulous landlord. It is owned by a government minister – and the locals are furious. Neighbours say the scaffolding in Havant, Hampshire has been up for two years and forces traffic to slow down . They say David Willetts has allowed the 17th-century property to become a crumbling ‘eyesore’ that is blighting their town. At the building in Havant, Hampshire, . where the 56-year-old Tory MP also has his constituency home, the . scaffolding alone has been there for two years. Tim Dawes, from the Havant Civic . Society, said: ‘I think it is beholden to David Willetts, who likes to . demonstrate that he has the interests of the town at heart, to do . something about it. David Willetts, the Universities Minister, said he was going back to the drawing board over what to do about his dilapidated property . ‘It’s in a conservation area so it’s . covered by certain requirements. David Willetts is a man of civic . responsibility and a man of reasonable personal resources. ‘I don’t think it’s unreasonable to . ask him to try to do something about it. It’s been in a state of . dilapidation for some time.’ The higher education minister, . nicknamed ‘Two Brains’ for his reputation as an intellectual, bought the . three-bedroom building with his wife Sarah Butterfield in 2008 for . £220,000. Miss Butterfield is a professional . artist who graduated from the Ruskin School of Fine Art in Oxford. Her . distinctive figurative paintings have been exhibited all over the world. The couple, who have two children, had . hoped to convert the property into two, two-bedroom houses, and . permission was granted by Havant council the same year. But as work was about to begin, surveyors found the property was structurally unsafe and would have to be pulled down. The scaffolding means that wheelchair . users, mothers with pushchairs and pensioners on mobility scooters are . constantly forced off the pavement and into oncoming traffic to get . past. The door and window frames are covered in dirt. Residents say Mr Willetts has taken too long to solve the problem. Ivy Harbey, 89, said: ‘The building . has been like that for years now. It’s not very nice at all and it’s . about time someone did something about it. It could be a lovely house . but it’s falling apart. ‘The scaffolding is a real nuisance . too because it takes up the pavement. I use a scooter to get into town . because I can’t walk and it’s sometimes difficult to get around the . scaffolding.’ David Willetts MP at his home in Havant.

As the boat floated away from police she shouted 'I'm Jack Sparrow' A drunk woman claimed she was a pirate as she hijacked a passenger ferry and floated away from police while shouting ‘I’m Jack Sparrow.’ Alison Whelan, 51, stole the 100-seater ferry on the River Dart in Devon after she had been drinking Lambrini and eating deadly plant nightshade for two days, causing her to hallucinate. She shouted ‘I’m Jack Sparrow’ and ‘I’m a pirate’ after she unmoored the Dart Princess Passenger Ferry, a 45ft vessel, with companion Tristam Locke from the Kingswear pontoon and set off up the river. The pair could be heard laughing and shouting from the deck ‘what are you going to do now?’ and ‘I believe this is out of your jurisdiction’. Whelan of Paignton, Devon was sentenced to 112 days in jail for the incident which saw the ferry bumping into other boats ‘like a pinball machine’ in a police chase that lasted an hour. More than 30 ambulance, police, coastguard and RNLI officers were drafted in during the incident, Torquay Magistrates Court in Devon heard. Speaking after the hearing, PC Clare Pearson said: 'This lady put the police, ambulance and coastguard to an awful lot of trouble. 'The amount of people called out to recover the boat and the damage caused to other vessels made it quite an expensive night.' Before the duo unmoored the boat, Whelan, who is a chronic alcoholic awaiting a liver transplant, called paramedics in the early hours of September 10 last year after fearing she was having a seizure. Paramedics said they found the defendant ‘rambling’ and obviously drunk while Locke became abusive and pushed over one of the medics. Ambulance technician Peter Jordan said he and his colleague waited in their vehicle a few yards away from the ferry for police to arrive. As they watched through the wing mirror the ferry started to move. He said: ‘We saw it drifting down the estuary. Unmoored boat: Whelan and companion Tristam Locke unmoored the Dart Princess Passenger Ferry, centre, which bumped into other moored boats before finally stopping about a mile upstream with the pair onboard . ‘I heard a female voice saying they were pirates and asking “what are we going to do now”.’ When police arrived, the medics said that Whelan and Locke were 200 yards away and heading towards dozens of other moored vessels. Whelan later told police she untied two or three of the ropes connecting the boat to the shore because she kept tripping over them. She said before she knew it she felt the boat moving and ‘noticed the hotels getting a long way away’. Police joined lifeboat crew on the river trying to intercept the boat. The harbour master was also alerted but the suspects shouted abuse from the out-of-control boat and made jokes about being kidnapped, the court was told. Jail sentence: Whelan was jailed for 112 days for the incident after her drinking spree in Torquay on the River Dart, pictured. When arrested she said they would have ended up in St Tropez if they had not been caught . The ferry bumped into a £70,000 fibreglass catamaran causing £300 of damage and another moored vessel. It finally came to rest in still water about a mile or so upstream from here it started. When arrested Whelan said they would have ended up in St Tropez if they had not been caught. Whelan . admitted that she and Locke had been on a drinking spree around Torbay, . Devon and that she had consumed poisonous nightshade, causing her to . hallucinate. Police heard Whelan shout 'I'm Jack Sparrow', referring to the character played by actor Johnny Depp in the Pirates of The Caribbean films (pictured) as the 45ft vessel floated away, causing a one hour chase . The ferry’s owner Kenneth Lane said he had moored the boat securely with seven ropes an hour or so before it was taken. Ashley Lane, the ferry's operations manager, said the would-be sailors were both 'exceptionally lucky to be alive'. He said: 'If the tide had been going out instead of coming in, the boat could have been pulled onto rocks and the two of them could have been killed.' The ferry suffered £1,500 worth of damage. The boat is usually used for wildlife cruises in the Torbay area but had been hired for a different job and was moored in nearby Kingswear that night. Locke, of Crediton in Devon was fined £100 at a separate court case last year after admitting assaulting an ambulance technician by beating. Whelan was sentenced to 112 days after being found guilty of aggravated vehicle taking by magistrates at Torquay. She denied the charge but magistrates found her guilty and she was also in breach of a four-month suspended sentence.","Alison Whelan spent two days drinking and eating plant nightshade, causing her to hallucinate before she unmoored the 45ft-long ferry .

Steve. No fear: Steve Gustafson fought off an alligator to save his beloved pet . The predator came up from the water and got the little dog by her shoulder and collar and began dragging her out into the water. Horrified, Steve ran down the hill and jumped after her, landing on top of the 130 lbs alligator. Thanks to his position, Mr Gustafson . managed to get hold of the alligator’s tail and back leg and began to . wrestle the reptile to make it let go of the 13lbs terrier locked in its . jaws.

Two top officials at the Department of Justice were ousted from their jobs today but Attorney General Eric Holder was ruled blameless by a damning report that uncovered a catalog or errors in judgement in the Fast and Furious gun-trafficking scandal. Two senior officials left the department, one by resignation and one by retirement, upon release of the 471-page internal report. Its author, Inspector General Michael Horowitz, also referred 14 people for possible department disciplinary action for their roles in Operation Fast and Furious and a separate, earlier probe known as Wide Receiver, undertaken during the George W Bush administration. Escape: Attorney General Eric Holder was cleared of any wrongdoing in the Fast and Furious probe, but the report found that he should have been briefed on the investigation . Gunrunners: Some 1,400 of the 2,000 guns lost in Operation Fast and Furious are yet to be recovered . The high risk operation saw guns being allowed to be purchased by Mexican gangsters and Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives agents were supposed to track them to higher level drug cartel members and catch the bigger fish red-handed. But, it backfired and resulted in hundreds of weapons turning up at crime scenes in the U.S. and Mexico. And in the worst failure U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, who was gunned down in December 2010 with two guns that agents had been trying to track. Terry's murder was the catalyst that began the internal probe into the gun operation after two of the 2,000 weapons thought to have been acquired by illicit buyers were found at the murder scene. About 1,400 of the total are yet to be recovered. No criminal charges were recommended in the report. Victim: U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was gunned down with one of the weapons used in Operation Fast and Furious in December 2010 . The documents did not criticise Holder, but said lower-level officials should have briefed him about the investigation much earlier. Investigators found that Holder didn't know anything about Fast and Furious until late January/early February and found no evidence that that the attorney general was told about the much-disputed 'gun-walking' tactic employed by the department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The inspector general found fault with the work of the senior ATF leadership, the ATF staff and U.S. attorney's office in Phoenix and senior officials of Justice's criminal division in Washington. He also said that poor internal information-gathering and drafting at Justice and ATF caused the department to initially misinform Congress about Fast and Furious. One of those criticized in the report, former ATF acting director Kenneth Melson, who headed that office during the Fast and Furious investigation, retired upon release of the report. 'Melson made too many assumptions about the case,' the report stated. 'Melson should have asked basic questions about the investigation, including how public safety was being protected.' Another of those criticized, Justice Department career attorney Jason Weinstein, resigned. Weinstein was a deputy assistant attorney general in Justice's criminal division in Washington. 'Weinstein was the most senior person in the department in April and May 2010 who was in a position to identify the similarity between the inappropriate tactics used in Operations Wide Receiver and Fast and Furious,' the report said. Weinstein's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, called the report's criticism 'profoundly wrong' and 'deeply flawed.' Resigned: Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein, the top Justice Department official with the power to stop Operation Fast and Furious . Arsenal: Weapons tied to the gun trafficking operation known Fast and Furious were discovered in April in the home of Jose Antonio Torres Marrufo, in the volatile city of Juarez, Mexico . In Operation Fast and Furious and at least three earlier probes during the administration of George W. Bush, agents in Arizona employed a risky tactic called gun-walking - allowing low-level 'straw' buyers - believed to be working for notorious Mexican drug cartels - to leave with loads of weapons purchased at gun shops. But because of thin ATF staffing and weak penalties, the traditional strategy of arresting suspected straw buyers as soon as possible had failed to stop the flow of tens of thousands of guns to Mexico - more than 68,000 in the past five years. The goal was to track the guns to major weapons traffickers and drug cartels in order to bring cases against kingpins who had long eluded prosecution under the former strategy of arresting low-level purchasers of guns who were suspected of buying them for others. The report also said that poor internal information-gathering and drafting at the Justice Department and ATF caused the department to initially misinform Congress about Fast and Furious. Out: Kenneth Melson, the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' retired upon the release of the report, which heavily criticised him for assuming too much . Rep Darrell Issa, chairman of the House . Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and vocal critic of the . operation, said: 'The inspector general's report confirms findings by . Congress' investigation of a near total disregard for public safety in . Operation Fast and Furious.' The report's conclusion reads: 'Our . review of Operation Fast and Furious and related matters revealed a . series of misguided strategies, tactics, errors in judgment, and . management failures that permeated ATF Headquarters and the Phoenix . Field Division, as well as the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District . of Arizona.' One of the five suspects in Terry's murder was arrested two weeks ago. Jesus Leonel Sanchez Meza, who was arrested on September 6 in Sonora state. Another suspect is currently on trial, while three more - Jesus Rosario Favela-Astorga, 31, Ivan Soto-Barraza, 34, Heraclio Osorio-Arellanes, 34 - remain at large.","471-page report cleared Attorney General Eric Holder of any wrongdoing, but said he should have been briefed about the probe .

He also owes approximately another £3,000 in fines and court costs he claims to know nothing about. Gladiator and Pirates of the Caribbean star Djalili, 46, of East Sheen, London, argued he needed to keep his licence to avoid fanatics, who have issued death threats, and abusive passengers on public transport. The father-of-three denied, but was convicted at City of London Magistrates’ Court, of riding his Piaggio MP3 without insurance and not in accordance with a licence in Grosvenor Road, Pimlico on May 4. He was fined £2,000, given six penalty points for driving without insurance and fined £700 for the licence offence and ordered to pay £600 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Djalili admitted illegally riding his moped in a cycle-only superhighway lane while travelling to the Vaudeville Theatre, where he was starring in Joe Orton’s ‘What The Butler Saw’ and was fined an additional £200. Police Sergeant Simon Rhodes told the court: 'I was drawn to the speed, which I deemed to be over thirty miles per hour. The vehicle then pulled into the cycle lane and undertook six vehicles.' The officer impounded the scooter because Djalili’s licence had passed the twelve penalty point threshold, rendering his insurance invalid, and it took the entertainer two weeks to get it back. 'I had absolutely no idea I had these points on my licence, I never received anything', Djalili told the court.

His abrupt death at 42 shocked legions of fans still mesmerised today by his singing, sex appeal and on-stage charisma. The vigil, which runs through to Thursday morning, marked the high point of Elvis Week, the annual celebration of Presley's life and career. Organisers said around 75,000 people were expected by authorities to take part in the vigil. Those who participated in the procession moved up the tree-lined driveway to the right of the mansion, where the gravesite is located near a swimming pool. Heart-shaped wreaths made of red and white flowers lined the entrance to the site. Tony and Ollie Smith, from the UK, hold candles as they wait on the street outside Graceland .

Some teary-eyed mourners laid flowers on the gravesite, where Presley's father Vernon, mother Gladys, and grandmother Minnie Mae Hood Presley also are buried. Outside, some fans used chalk to draw pictures of Elvis's face on the street, where groups of fans set up folding chairs to wait for the line to die down.

'I felt the spirit of Elvis there, as if he was alive,' said Galleguillo, who was making his first visit to the U.S.. 'It really was a beautiful experience.' The somber atmosphere of the vigil was in contrast to some lighter moments beforehand. As the line of people waiting to get into Graceland grew longer on Wednesday evening, a group from a Brazilian fan club waved that nation's flag, danced and sang Presley's early-70s hit Burning Love in the street in front of the entrance. Steps away, an Elvis impersonator, complete with a white-sequined jumpsuit and red sash, sat alone in the street in front of the entrance, lip synching 'In the Ghetto.' Earlier in the day, Cheryl Skogen and friend Susan Struss held up black umbrellas with polka dots near the front of the line as they waited to enter Graceland's grounds. As longtime Elvis fans and neighbors in Los Angeles, they said they decided to come to Elvis Week without their husbands. They got up well before dawn Wednesday for a prime spot in the line. Skogen said she first came to Graceland in 1981 - before the home became a museum and a tourist attraction - and has visited several times since. She remembers first seeing Elvis on The Ed Sullivan Show and being enthralled with his hip-swiveling performance at a Lack Tahoe concert. 'The first time I saw him he changed my life,' said Skogen, now 66 and retired. 'I had never seen anybody dance like he did or sing like he did or look like he did. He captured my heart.' A few spots down the line, Allen Black, 47, sat in a blue and white chair alongside the outer wall of Graceland. Black - who is from Aurora, Colorado, scene of the July 20 movie theatre shooting massacre - said Elvis was a great performer but also someone who treated others well. He talked about his memories of where he was when he first heard Elvis had died. He was 12 at the time. 'I was trying to record a song off the radio, and the news came on the radio, and I went to tell my dad,' Black said, tears welling in his eyes. 'He didn't believe me. It just stunned him.'

After facing a carpeting from the Palace for cavorting naked with a mystery woman in a Las Vegas hotel room, Prince Harry's burgeoning reputation as a mature young statesman looked to be on the line. But it appears many think that rather than be ridiculed for his drunken game of 'strip billiards' this week in Sin City, he should instead be congratulated for being being the model British playboy. Revealing images showing the third in line to the throne standing in a VIP hotel suite in only a necklace with a mystery nude brunette hiding behind him were seen by millions across the world online. It was assumed that he would be lambasted for bringing the royal family into global disrepute but, in fact, Twitter is awash with thousands of comments from admiring celebrities and fans saying he was a 'good lad' acting 'exactly as a Prince should do'. Even Sir Richard Barnson said: 'Shock horror, single man naked in own hotel room with woman. What on earth has this got to do with anybody else? Leave Prince Harry alone.' Leave him alone: Sir Richard Branson was one of many who leapt to the defence of the third in line to the throne . Support: Piers Morgan was one of many celebrities to back the prince publicly as public opinion appeared to swing in Harry's favour . Rock royalty: Kurt Cobain's former wife and musician, Courtney Love, also backed his behaviour as becoming of a prince . But the prince hasn't avoided criticism completely. Some of Fleet Street's most high profile columnists have attacked his naked antics, with some saying he is a 'disgrace' who should be stripped of his royal title and privileges. Last night the Palace banned the British press from using the pictures, which are freely available online. Should British newspapers and websites publish the nude pictures of Prince Harry in Las Vegas? The Times used its main leader column to warn Harry of the consequences of his mistakes in a Nevada hotel this week, especially after he had represented Britain and the royal family so well at the Olympics. 'Prince Harry is the occupant of a . special place in the nation's heart. Like a Royal Boris Johnson the . prince has earned a rare licence to be seen having fun,' it said, adding: 'But he must tread carefully and in future, more carefully than this. 'His reinvention has been a . joy to behold, with a new maturity becoming evident alongside his easy . manner and charm. As a single young man, blessed with money and looks, . he is perfectly free to set his sights on being the nation's favourite . playboy. But it would be a shame.' Letting his heir down: Prince Harry relaxed poolside surrounded by bikini-clad girls in Vegas and even played naked billiards put the public appear to want to back him for it . Party-boy: 'Prince Harry, far right in a hat, went to Vegas to relax after the Olympics but it gout of hand . A quick search on the the internet allows people to see the pictures that are 'banned' in the UK . An identical search on Google images for 'Prince Harry naked pictures' reveals dozens more shots of the cavorting Prince . The Daily Telegraph's Peter Oborne said Harry had ignored his responsibilities to the Queen and the Armed Forces. 'What was Prince Harry thinking of? He’s not a gormless 19-year-old boy any more. He’s a grown-up man, a 27-year-old Army officer who also happens to be third in line to the throne,' he wrote. 'He belongs to an institution that stands for certain forms of behaviour, and cannot survive if its members flout them. Opinion: The British press was barred from using the pictures, despite them being freely available online, The Times said in its leader column, adding , in essence, that Harry is likeable but has to grow up . 'Indeed, the Prince belongs to two such institutions: he is an officer in the British Army, and as such is expected to observe its own code of ethics. That this, too, was broken during this trip to Las Vegas is no coincidence. The Army is another institution that requires discipline, restraint, forbearance and sacrifice.' The Mail's Amanda Platell said: 'How unfortunate that when things . were going so well for him, Harry gets caught with his pants down – . literally – and pictures of him partying naked are beamed across the . world. 'Who on earth advised the third in line to the throne to indulge . in some ""full-on partying"" in the world’s self-styled capital of sleaze, . Las Vegas? Trashing: The Daily Telegraph's esteemed commentator Peter Oborne laid into Harry and his antics in this morning's paper . Critical: Oborne questioned Harry's maturity and ability to make the right decisions . 'Downing vodka shots and cavorting . until the early hours of the morning with bikini-clad wannabes, this was . more the world of soft-porn films than the behaviour expected of the . Queen’s grandson. Opinion: The Mail's Amanda Platell said she had sympathy for Harry for what he has experienced in life, but believed his Vegas strip billiards showed huge error of judgment . 'We had come to think that poor judgment and immaturity . were all in the past for Harry. For, at the age of 27, he is now a man . with the responsibilities of an Army officer. 'So, yes, we have made allowances for . Harry, but he will be 28 next month and it’s time he grew up.' The Guardian was even stronger in its criticism, saying that the prince should be stripped of his title. 'What shall we do with Prince Harry? It hasn't even been two weeks since he represented the Queen at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics, and there he is in VEGAS, NAKED, playing STRIP BILLIARDS,' said writer Emma Keller. 'I have an idea for him and for other members of the royal family who gad about and undermine the hard work of the rest of their team (Prince Andrew, anyone?) 'Let's strip them of their royal status. He could get as drunk as he likes and strip of all over the place – just like any old toff. 'He'd . still have a job. He has a real job in the army already that has . nothing to do with being royal. 'He's a captain in the Blues and Royals and has served in Afghanistan – at his own behest. But if you remember, he had to be pulled out because of publicity over his royal status. So being royal is nothing but a pain for him.' But despite the criticism, the online world seems to be backing the prince, especially celebrities. Amanda Platell said that Harry's behaviour had got out of control on his American jaunt . British DJ Christian O'Connell said: 'Prince Harry is doing EXACTLY as a prince should do. Party in Vegas. Good luck to him.' Fellow . DJ Lauren Laverne added: Prince Harry is EASILY the best royal,' while . 80s pop star Marc Almond said: 'I love Prince Harry getting his kit off . and having fun before duty in Afg(hanistan). HELL YEAH GO HARRY!' Boy George tweeted: 'Prince Harry, where was his security? People are so cheap, such . rubbish photos! The Queen should behead TMZ and send the bitches to da . Tower.' Star backing: Boy George said that security and 'cheap' partygoers were to blame for the incident, not Harry, above and below . DJ backing: Cristian O'Connell believes that Harry's exploits should be celebrated . Pop star: Marc Almond said that Harry needed to let his hair down before returning to work as a Captain in the army . He's the best: Lauren Laverne really enjoyed what Harry had been up to . ""I'm shocked and disgusted by the Prince Harry party photos in Vegas. Why the hell wasn't I invited???' Piers Morgan said, to which Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria replied: 'Piers this tweet made me laugh out loud!' Courtney Love Cobain Twitter said 'wow you gotla [sic] love Prince Harry for showing off the . royal jewels.... oh let him have fun, xc' And the public also sung his praises: @Leti_Rodriguez said: 'Whatever happened to ""What Happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas""? #PrinceHarry #PoorGuy' Envious: Popstar and presenter Jenny Frost says that people have a motive for castigating the prince and his behaviour .

A pod of whales had a narrow escape after becoming stranded at low tide on mudflats in a notoriously treacherous bay. Around 20 endangered beluga whales were beached for several hours on one of the countless sandbanks which litter Turnagain Arm, southeast of Anchorage, Alaska. A conservationist spotted the unfolding drama as the endangered mammals won their life or death struggle to reach deeper water and photographed the scene from the cockpit of a low-flying plane. Stranded: A pod of around 20 beluga whales were pictured during a life or death struggle to free themselves from a mudflat in Turnagain Arm, south of Anchorage, Alaska . The whales face the ever-present . threat of being stranded in the bay's water due to its long and narrow . shape, which means animals must move quickly to deeper water as soon as the tide turns. The water travels about 20 miles as . the arm floods and empties each tidal cycle. In June 1995, about 190 . whales stranded but none died. Some strandings, however, are deadly. In August 2004, five or six whales died when 46 stranded in the arm. About the same number are believed to have died in 1999, when about 50 . whales stranded. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration got a call Tuesday afternoon that some beluga whales were spotted stranded in the arm southeast of Anchorage, agency spokeswoman Julie Speegle said. NOAA law enforcement officer Noah Meisenheimer boarded a Piper Cub airplane with a pilot from the Alaska State Troopers to go searching for the whales. Struggle: The pod can be clearly seen on one of the countless sandbanks which litter the treacherous Turnagain Arm, during low tide . Treacherous: The beauty of Turnagain Arm hides dangers to animals and humans who venture in the bay . At about 7:45 p.m., the whales were seen gathered together in a small pool in the mud. After the pilot lowered the plane from 1,000 feet to 500 feet to get a better look, Meisenheimer counted about 20 belugas on the mudflats at mid-channel just west of Bird Point. Low tide was at 6 p.m. and by this time, the tide was coming in. The white whales were wriggling about trying to get free, Meisenheimer said. The pilot took a brief tour to look for more whales but didn't find any. When he returned to where they had seen the whales struggling in the mud, the water was higher and they spotted about 10 swimming in the general area. None seemed distressed and no dead whales were seen. Cook Inlet belugas are endangered. The most recent survey in 2011 counted 284 whales. The reasons for whale strandings are not fully understood, said Rod Hobbs, beluga project leader for the National Marine Mammal Lab in Seattle. It is possible the whales find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time after chasing salmon or avoiding killer whales, he said. What scientists do know is that when belugas become stranded they tend to gather together in the mud and move around to create a small pool, where water coursing over their flukes and flippers helps keep them cool, he said. The whales this time likely were stuck for about four hours, Hobbs said. ‘They go up and down those arms of the inlet a couple of times a day with the tides,’ he said. ‘Every once in a while something happens.’","Endangered mammals' life or death struggle captured on camera by conservationist .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 03:34 EST, 24 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:15 EST, 24 August 2012 . Wonky carrots, stunted parsnips and imperfect apples will all make a return to supermarket shelves after Britain's dismal weather conditions affected this year's harvest. Shoppers are used to browsing the aisles for strawberries, cucumbers and carrots that look just as good as they taste. But the wettest June on record, a cool July, and hail storms in August have all taken a toll on Britain's fruit and vegetables - prompting retailers to relax their rules on the cosmetic standards for produce. Not so pretty parsnips: Misshapen vegetables like these gnarled parsnips could soon be appearing on supermarket shelves as a result of the poor harvest . The move comes after farmers urged retailers not to waste perfectly tasty fresh produce because of a few blemishes or an unusual shape. EU rules on misshapen fruit and veg were relaxed in 2009 but supermarkets still maintain private product standards. The National Farmers Union has said its members were already struggling to cope with below average yields this year. In June apple growers told how their orchards had been blighted by frost, rain and hailstorms, meaning the year's crop would be dramatically reduced. Fruit farmers in the West Midlands, East Anglia, the South West and parts of the South East said they had lost as much as 65 per cent of their harvest. In July - traditionally peak season for potatoes - farmers reported that they had lost 40 per cent of their potato crop because of waterlogged fields. If supermarkets were to reject what produce has survived, it could push some farmers out of business, according to the NFU. Wonky: Fruit and vegetables that are the 'wrong' shape are just as tasty as the more aesthetically pleasing versions . 'The NFU has been calling on supermarkets to relax their standards because we do not want perfectly good fruit and vegetables rejected,' said Lee Abbey, a horticulture adviser at the union. 'Common sense should be applied,' he told the Daily Telegraph. Small marks on the skin of fruits do not affect their flavour, but supermarkets will often reject blemished produce. Retailers also insist on vegetables meeting certain size standards, despite the fact that a small carrot will taste just as good as a larger one. This year major supermarkets Asda, Tesco, Waitrose and Sainsbury's have all pledged to sell more fruit and veg that previously would have been dumped for failing to meet cosmetic standards. But author Tristram Stuart, who campaigns against food wastage, said a one-off relaxation of rules in response to the poor harvest was not enough. He has said farmers are routinely forced to throw away up to 40 per cent of a crop because it is not aesthetically pleasing enough. According to Mr Stuart, founder of the Feeding the 5,000 campaign, when the harvest returns to normal farmers will again be forced to dump produce. Misshapen: In 2009 the EU relaxed rules governing the cosmetic appearance of fruit and veg . In 2009 the EU announced it was to repeal specific marketing standards for 26 different types of fruit and vegetables, including asparagus, aubergines, sprouts, cabbage, melons and courgettes. The change effectively meant that member states could permit the sale of all fruit and vegetables - regardless of their size and shape. Specific marketing standards remained in place for apples, citrus fruit, kiwis, lettuce, peaches, nectarines, pears, strawberries, sweet peppers, grapes and tomatoes. But the change meant EU countries could still allow retailers to stock fruit and veg that failed to meet the standards if they labelled items appropriately.","Supermarkets to relax restrictions on 'ugly' fruit and veg after wet weather takes a toll on the British harvest .

British police searching for missing Ben . Needham, who disappeared as a toddler 21 years ago, want to dig up a plot in Greece over suspicions he may be buried there, . Officers are in talks with police from the Greek island of Kos over fears that the little boy may have been accidentally buried under rubble. Ben . was just 21-months-old when he disappeared from the island of Kos in . July 1991, and there has been no trace of him since despite an . international search. The Daily Mirror reported that Ben's body could have been covered up with rubble dumped by a driver who was excavating earth near to where he disappeared. Officers are considering using sophisticated 3D scanning equipment to hunt for bones beneath the earth's surface, the newspaper reported. South Yorkshire Police confirmed that they were contemplating making another search of the area where Ben vanished. His mother, Kerry Needham, 40, said the 'heart wrenching' potential discovery of her son's dead body was a 'horrendous thought' but necessary. She insists that Ben is still alive and told the Daily Mirror that she believed police would not find Ben in the latest investigation and this would lead to a renewed man hunt for her child. Ms Needham, who was just 19 when Ben went missing, said to the newspaper: 'It is going to be soul destroying but once they have done it and not found Ben, the Greek police and everyone else in the world will know my son's alive.' She said her years spent waiting for an answer as to what happened to her child had been torture, and that she and her family have been victims of untrue rumours that they had been involved with Ben's disappearance.

Thriving: Britain's soggy summer has provided perfect breeding conditions for pesky mosquitoes . Beware this Bank Holiday weekend. If the rain doesn’t get you, a mosquito might. Sun-starved Britons who had their hopes of a glorious summer dashed by persistent rain are now dealing with another unpleasant side effect of the bizarre weather - an explosion in the mosquito and flea populations. The . current wet and humid conditions have created a perfect breeding ground . for midges and mozzies and huge numbers of people have already reported . bites. There are even fears of a new 'superflea' evolving - one that is resistant to existing sprays and creams used to tackle the problem. In the past week alone Tesco has seen sales of the creams shoot up by 150 per cent at its pharmacies across the UK, while the number of people calling NHS Direct for advice on treating bites is at its highest level in three years. 'The recent balmy weather has led to the most concentrated demand for insect bite and sting creams we have ever seen,' said Tesco spokeswoman Joy Wickham. 'Demand has been rising through the summer and during the very muggy weather we had last weekend we saw the highest sales so far this year.' The insects won’t be the only  hazard, however. As around 1.8million Britons prepare to head abroad for the break, the Met Office is warning of heavy downpours across the country. Some areas could see as much as two inches of rain today. Forecasters issued a 24-hour severe weather alert, predicting torrential storms and gusts of winds of up to 50mph along the south coast. Things could start looking up tomorrow, however. Most of the country is expected to see a drier day with the exception of northern England where there could be some lingering showers. Temperatures are not expected to reach much higher than 20C (68F) over the weekend. Gareth Harvey, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: ‘It won’t be the best of Bank Holiday weekends. There’s an Atlantic depression heading in towards the UK, bringing spells of quite heavy rain.’ He added: ‘Monday may start off sunny in some areas, particularly in the East, which will hold on to it for a good part of the day.’ NHS Direct confirmed that this summer has seen the highest number of calls about insect bites and stings for three years. People coping with the humid weather by sleeping with their windows open and spending more time outside are finding themselves plagued by parasites. As people prepare to descend on parks and beer gardens over the bank holiday weekend chemists are ordering in extra supplies of bite remedies to combat the impact of increased numbers of insects eager to sink their 'teeth' into unwitting humans. Entomologist Steven Falk, from the conservation charity Buglife, said the mosquito population had dramatically increased on account of the wet spring and summer - which has created perfect breeding conditions for the pesky flies. 'The wet and humid weather has resulted in an increased breeding habitat for mosquitoes, such as pools and water-filled ditches, which has led to more people being bitten than during a normal year,' he said. Population explosion: Fleas like this one pictured in a dog's fur are also on the increase thanks to the wet and warm weather . And its not just insect remedies for humans that are flying off the shelves - there has also been a 'dramatic' increase in demand for flea treatments for household pets. The UK's flea population has also been thriving in the damp weather conditions, and sales of flea treatments are up 25 per cent year on year, according to BBC Radio 4's consumer programme You and Yours. Ouch: Tesco has reported a 150 per cent increase in demand for insect bite creams in the past week alone at its pharmacies across the UK . Lucy Chadwick, head vet for retailer Pet Drugs Online, said: 'The [sales] numbers do fluctuate a bit from time to time but this is quite dramatic.' Dr Tim Nuttall, veterinary dermatologist at the University of Liverpool, said the flea population has been rising for the past five years but that it has spiked more dramatically in the past two. He explained that the increase in numbers is almost all down to the cat flea, which - despite its title - will live off dogs, ferrets and humans as well as felines. The boom is bad news for those of us susceptible to bites, as experts say that even when fleas appear to be beaten, they can make an unexpected return. Richard Mosely, of the British Pest Control Association, said: 'They have an ability to go into a sort of suspended animation. 'Even if you go into a flat which has been unoccupied for a year, their cocoons can be set off again by the carbon dioxide in people's breath.' Midges and other insects are also on the rise thanks to the washout summer, and NHS Direct has reported an overall rise in the number of calls about all varieties of stings and bites since early May. Calls to the service have doubled since the beginning of July, with the number of queries continuing to rise throughout the month of August. In the period since May, NHS Direct has dealt with 8,953 calls about bites and stings, compared to 8,641 this time last year, and 7,450 for the same period in 2010. Washout: Festivities marking the Queen's Diamond Jubilee were among the events marred by lashing rain this summer. Fans gathered to watch the river pageant are pictured sheltering from the showers . Despite recent warm temperatures, the summer of 2012 is likely to be remembered as one marred by persistent bouts of heavy rain. The pattern is set to continue with forecasters predicting a wet and windy bank holiday this weekend. Intermittent sunny spells are expected to be accompanied by stormy weather conditions that will sweep across the country - threatening to turn the bank holiday weekend into yet another washout.

Partnership: David Cameron could ask Foreign Secretary William Hague to swap with George Osborne but sources claim this is unlikely . Conservatives are divided over his . performance with 44 per cent believing he is doing a bad job and 43 per cent saying he . is doing a good job. The partnership formed between David Cameron and his Chancellor George Osborne is a strong one. They are so close they made one another godfathers to each other's children. Mr Osborne was campaign manager for David Cameron's leadership campaign in 2005. In 2009 the Prime Minister was asked if he would sack his friend if things were going badly, despite their firm friendship. 'With George, the answer is yes,' he said, 'He stayed in my shadow cabinet not because he is a friend, not because we are godfathers to each other's children but because he is the right person to do the job. I know and he knows that if that was not the case he would not be there.' But this month he ruled it out. 'George Osborne is doing an excellent job in very difficult circumstances and he has my full support in going on doing that job,’ he said. Asked if that meant Mr Osborne would still be in place in 2015, the scheduled time of the next election, he replied: ‘He’s not going anywhere… yes.’ Mr Osborne has faced repeated criticism for failing to kick-start the . UK's floundering economy as well as presiding over a budget that . sparked a series of U-turns. ICM Research interviewed 1,006 adults by telephone between August 24 and 26. The Prime Minister is doing much better in the eyes of voters than his his old friend the Chancellor. Two thirds of Tory supporters say he is doing a good job compared to the 25 per cent who maintain he isn't. Only a fifth of those asked believe William Hague should be shuffled meaning that he is a prime candidate to replace Mr Osborne should he be given the push. But despite this pressure to sack the Chancellor it is believed that Mr Cameron will not. Firstly because he is his closest and most trusted ally and secondly Cameron subscribes to Thatcher's view that to move a Chancellor is a sign of weakness and could unsettle the financial markets. One senior Tory told the Guardian: 'Margaret Thatcher did not have to move her chancellor in her first term because she appointed the right person in the first place. 'George Osborne only became shadow chancellor in 2005 because David Cameron turned it down on the grounds that he was too young. The prime minister is five years older than George who got the job at the age of 33. That was ridiculous.' After Mr Osborne in the unpopularity rankings was Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, then Michael Gove, Kenneth Clarke and Jeremy Hunt, who all had at least a quarter of voters believing they should be sacked. Overall Labour still lead the by 39 per cent to 34 per cent. While the Lib Dems are up one point to 15 per cent.","48% believe Mr Osborne should be ousted but this rises even higher among certain age groups .

While millions of people around the world have been able to view the naked images of Prince Harry cavorting with girls in a Las Vegas hotel online, the photographs have been banned in Britain by a furious Royal Family. British newspapers and TV stations have been unable to show the pictures after Harry's father Prince Charles threatened legal action and St James’s Palace warned that the pictures were a gross invasion of the young royal's privacy. Minutes after naked images of Prince Harry appeared on entertainment site TMZ, they were also available to millions of internet users around the world – including those in Britain. Scandal: Prince Harry mingles with the ladies on his Las Vegas holiday when he was pictured cavorting naked with women in a hotel . The two grainy pictures of the young . royal cavorting with a naked woman in his Las Vegas hotel suite were . published on the Internet at around 4.30pm (PST). The pictures . first appeared on TMZ, which is the second most popular entertainment . news website in the U.S. and has an audience of more than 18.5million on . its own. But within hours, they were also being shared on dozens other websites with a huge combined global reach. By last night, a Google search for ‘Prince Harry Naked’ produced 68,300,000 results. A search for ‘Prince Harry Naked Pictures’ generated 25,800,000 results. Once Harry had returned to the UK, lawyers for Prince Charles issued threats of legal action. Meanwhile, the pictures continued to be available online, making a mockery of British privacy laws. Like wildfire: How the story of Harry's naked photos broke and then swept across the globe online . Pugh's take on the Harry saga . Popular blogs picked up on the story and published the . pictures within an hour of them appearing on TMZ. NBC made a video report showing the photographs in the early hours on the East Coast and . they were featured on magazine website The People. The pictures soon appeared on the . Toronto Sun website in Canada, the Hindustan Times in India and the . Daily Life in Australia. Italian . and Spanish websites – including Hot Magazine – quickly published the . pictures and even in France, where privacy laws are . strict, websites were displaying them. Respected broadcasters such as CNN and Canada’s CBC news showed all or part of the pictures in broadcasts. By late morning, the pictures were published by the LA Times and TIME websites, the Huffington Post, Australia’s Ninemsm and Powerfm, the Vancouver Sun in Canada and Jezebel, a popular celebrity news and gossip website which closely follows U.S. tabloids. Oh no! Prince Harry pictured just an hour after the photos went online in what could be the moment of realisation . The Prince Harry story has echoes of the way Edward VIII’s affair with the married American socialite Wallis Simpson went unreported for months in Britain in 1936 while newspapers in the U.S. and Europe gleefully revealed the details. British papers maintained a self-imposed silence to avoid provoking a constitutional crisis after a request from the Palace gave rise to an agreement not to break the story prematurely. It eventually broke in December after the Bishop of Bradford publicly implied that the King lacked the moral dedication required for his role. TMZ – the website which broke the news of Michael Jackson’s death – was even running a poll asking its viewers if Prince Harry was ‘awesome’ or ‘disgraceful’. More than 340,000 had voted, with almost two-thirds opting for ‘awesome’. All of these websites can be easily viewed in the UK, and many, such as the Huffington Post, TMZ and Jezebel, already have a loyal British audience. Popular British political blogger Guido Fawkes also published the pictures with a boast about how newspapers were unable to do so. And despite the efforts by the Royal Family to block publication of the pictures in the UK, they were printed in Northern Ireland after Ireland’s Evening Herald put one on their front page. Meanwhile on Facebook, which has more than 900million global users, the pictures were featuring on the newsfeeds of millions of British users as they were discussed and debated around the world. And throughout yesterday the pictures were commented on and shared by millions of Twitter users meaning ‘Prince Harry’ was one of the ‘trends’, or most popular discussion topics, on the social network.","UK press banned from using images after Prince Charles issues legal threats .

Police have unearthed a secret cannabis farm being grown deep in Middle England woodland in what is feared to be a new tactic by mobsters to hide their illegal crops. Two officers acting on a tip off waded through thick bracken to find it was camouflaging ten cannabis plants up to 6ft high being grown in a forest clearing. Experts believe they were grown by 'guerilla' farmers hoping to exploiting the warmer summer weather in Britain to grow the drugs in the outdoors. PC Andy Kent (left) and PC Warren Davison of Cheshire Police unearthing a secret cannabis farm being grown deep in English woodland at Oakhanger in Crewe . Last March a new police crackdown on dope factories was ordered after figures showed the number of cannabis factories found inside properties across the UK had increased from 3,032 to 6,866 over the past four years. Many are said to be run by criminal gangs - usually from Vietnam. Cannabis has been grown outdoors before in the UK but usually just one or two plants in private gardens. Today, Cheshire Police confirmed the find at woodland in Oakhanger near Crewe on Friday afternoon - and revealed it was the first outdoor cannabis farm its officers had found. The plants would have yielded a total of 250g of cannabis giving it a street value of up to £3,000. PC Andy Kent said he and PC Warren Davison had received information from a member of the public that cannabis was being cultivated in the public woods. PC Kent said: 'After fighting through bracken up to 6ft high and searching the woodland we found 10 cannabis plants that had been purposefully planted and were quite obviously being tendered to by someone. Secret garden: The cannabis plants were hidden in woodland in what is feared to be a new tactic by mobsters to hide their illegal crops . Secluded: The spot is near Taylors Lane at Oakhanger Woods in Crewe, Cheshire . Experts believe the plants were grown by 'guerilla' farmers hoping to exploiting the warmer summer weather . 'They are well off the beaten track and had grown quite successfully. Someone has spent a considerable amount of their time in these woods and may have been spotted attending regularly to the site.' PC Kent added: 'Cannabis is a Class B drug and any person found cultivating it can face up to 14 years imprisonment at Crown Court. 'We are committed to tackling the increase in domestic cannabis growers and also larger scale operations. I would urge anyone with information about the person responsible for this cannabis crop to contact us.' The find came as Cheshire Police . revealed a Vietnamese crime boss who rang a series of drugs factories . across the Crewe area was found to have made £1.3million from cannabis . farming. Don Han Le, 42, who . ran a Chinese restaurant, had been using illegal Vietnamese immigrants, . known as 'gardeners', to harvest the cannabis at up to 18 properties. More than 4,000 cannabis plants were recovered, with a street value of almost £700,000. PC Andy Kent said he and PC Warren Davison had received information from a member of the public that cannabis was being cultivated in the public woods . Le was convicted of conspiracy to produce class B controlled drugs and acquiring, using and possessing criminal property and was also jailed for seven years at Chester Crown Court. He must repay £137,000 or face another two years in jail. Cannabis plants can be planted outdoors in natural soil but due it needing hot weather typical growing regions include Mexico, Nepal, Northern India, many parts of Africa, Afghanistan, California and Australia. In most places of the subtropics, cannabis is grown from late spring to early summer and harvested from late summer to early autumn. Growers fearful of being 'ripped off' usually cultivate outdoor cannabis farms in remote areas such as forest clearings or mountain cliffs - and might even attach pots to trees. But they choose areas that receive 12 hours or more of sunlight a day. In the U.S, cannabis farms are hidden by maize and camouflaged with bamboo and elderberry. Guidance from the Association of Chief Police Officers says that cannabis 'farms' are usually located in private dwellings. While some are of little commercial value the largest ever discovered, in Cambridgeshire in 2010, led to the seizure of 7,600 plants with a value of £2.5million. The number of plants is not relevant. A property will be treated as a 'farm' if it possesses either high intensity lighting, ventilation, a hydroponics system or is bypassing an electrical meter. Commercial cannabis production has been associated with trafficking of adults and their children from China and Vietnam. The police and UK Border Agency made 212,784 drug seizures in England and Wales in 2010/11. Cannabis use has increased to 6.8 per cent of all 16-59-year-olds since penalties for its possession were raised in 2009, although is still lower than the 9.5 per cent of 1996. Liberal MEP Chris Davies, who is campaigning for a change of Britain's drug laws, said: 'We have all become familiar with stories of cannabis being grown under artificial lighting in houses and commercial buildings but this is the first time I have heard of it being planted like this in the wild. 'It may be the beginning of a trend. After all, hemp has been grown for centuries in Britain and used to make clothes, ropes and for a great number of different purposes. 'Maybe the cannabis dealers are starting to think about making money by becoming illicit farmers instead of illicit gardeners.'","Two officers acting on a tip off waded through thick bracken to find it .

A 12-stone dog the size of a small pony is lucky to be alive after plunging down a 150ft cliff and triggering a dramatic four-hour rescue operation. The giant puppy called Ted would have been dashed to death by rocks on the Cornish coast except a ledge broke his fall. He was trapped for four hours before a complex operation involving more than a dozen cliff rescue workers hauled him back up the cliffs for a joyful reunion with his owners. Puppy love: Twelve-stone Ted survived a 150 foot fall off a cliff in Morwenstow, Cornwall, to the relief of owners Lee Barnett and Gemma Richens, and their children Zak, 12, (middle), Xanthe, seven, and Tate, five, (right) The stubborn two-year-old, who had been refusing to wear his lead during his lunchtime holiday walks with Lee Barnett and his family, had escaped with nothing worse than a bloody nose. Lee says Ted, a Newfoundland, had been playing up during the week-long holiday near Morwenstow, North Cornwall, by refusing to wear his lead and generally being disobedient. They had, however, been walking him off the lead without any problems until the penultimate day of their holiday. Mr Barnett, 41, from Coventry, said: 'We were just out walking the dog. We had done it all the week. He was ten feet away from the path when he decided to go for it.' The hair salon boss gasped out 'no' and the pet turned to glance briefly back before running on and plunging down the cliffs. At first, the family feared the worst but as they peered down they saw he had hit a 10ft wide ledge above the rocks. Heavy petting: Fourteen rescue workers were involved in the bid to lift Ted, who was said to be the 'size of a small pony' Mr Barnett continued: 'The cliffs are 150ft deep. We realised there was no way I was going to get down to Ted.' Lee’s partner Gemma Richens, 38, ran off to a nearby tea room to raise the alarm. Children Zak, 12, Xanthe, seven, and Tate, five, were petrified as they waited to see what would happen next. Lee continued: 'I stayed on the edge talking to Ted. I was hanging over the edge trying to keep him calm while the children stayed on the path. Cliffhanger: The dotted line shows the path Ted took during his 150 ft tumble before rescuers descended the cliff to collect him . 'I kept my balance by hanging onto clumps of Lucky Heather. It was very lucky heather because if it had given way I would have gone over too. 'For the first hour he did not move. He was just yelping. Blood was coming from his mouth. 'By the time the rescue people arrived he was on his feet. All he had was a grazed nose. It was amazing.' The Hartland Cliff Rescue Team joined crews from Bude and Port Isaac and abseiled down to Ted. Fourteen men were involved in the rescue, which lasted another three hours. They set up a pulley system to hold the weight of the dog and one rescuer. They lowered a man on a bag to put Ted in and haul him back to the top. Ted got in the bag then jumped back out again. Prized pet: Ted and his family pose for a photo during their week-long holiday near Morwenstow, North Cornwall, before his dramatic plunge . 'Once he realised they wanted him in the bag he wanted none of it. So they had to lower two guys down using a stronger pulley system,' said Lee. Finally, Ted was reunited with his owners. 'I think his ego has been bruised at bit. But other than that he just has a scrape on his nose. It is remarkable and bizarre,' he added. 'There was nothing to stop him hurtling over. He ended up on a narrow rocky ledge about ten feet wide. If he had missed that he would have gone down onto the rocks. 'He is very lucky to be alive. If he were a cat he would definitely have lost a few lives.' Newfoundlands are known for their lifesaving skills, remarkable strength, loyalty and calmness - and are often used as working dogs by fishermen. Only way is pup: Animal lover Lee Barnett gives his miracle pet a hefty hug after their dramatic ordeal . A spokesperson for Falmouth Coastguard said: 'The initial report came in of a dog trapped on cliffs, but when the teams arrived it became clear this was an unusually large dog. 'It weighed 12 stone and was really the size of a small pony. The owner said they were walking along the top when it disappeared from view. 'The crews were able to descend to the dog and bring it back up. It was clearly a valiant effort.' Family and pet have now returned home to Coventry. Lee added: 'I just can’t praise what these guys did enough. It was absolutely fantastic. They said they had never rescued a dog like this and probably never will again.'","Giant puppy Ted trapped on rocky ledge after plummeting from Cornish cliff during family outing .

Emotions were running high at the Baltimore Ravens/ New England Patriots game on Sunday night and a fan chant of 'Bullsh*t,' aired live on NBC during primetime, had some saying the network had violated FCC standards. The expletive eruption from Ravens fans, enraged by non other than the league's replacement refs, was just one in a series of incidents at the NFL match at the M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore - including a random fan in a cape rushing the field and both coaches being punished for belligerence toward the infamous replacement refs. Baltimore enthusiasts cried out 'Bullsh*t' in the game's fourth quarter, when Ravens coach John Harbaugh received a penalty for 'unsportsmanlike behavior' when he knocked into a ref as he tried to call a time-out. Scroll down for video. Not happy: Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh (left) gets into it with a referee and Patriots coach Bill Belichick similarly ripped into the league's replacement refs, who have been the object of ridicule this season . The clearly comprehended curse word was repeated by the audience for several moments and though . the FCC initially said they were looking into whether NBC was negligent in airing the taunts . during their coverage on Sunday Night Football, the agency now says there won't be a fine. 'It's the loudest manure chant I've ever heard,' NBC sportscaster Al . Michaels said during the coverage in response to the audience chant against the refs, who . have been the object of ridicule by fans and NFL coaches alike. The FCC, headed by Julius . Genachowski, typically won't punish a network for a 'fleeting expletive' but since the shouts on Sunday were easily heard and lasted for several . minutes, some thought the Peacock Network could face a fine. But a FCC representative told TMZ, 'There’s never been any penalties imposed for obscenities inadvertently heard over air.' And a Ravens rep was equally nonplussed by the incident. 'We’re . certainly aware of it. Normally, our crowd is one of the most . enthusiastic and respectful home audiences in all of sports,' Senior . Vice President of Public and Community Relations for the franchise, . Kevin Byrne, said. Random: A fan rushed the field on Sunday at the M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore donning a cape with the head of comedian and talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres. He said the stunt was to support anti-bullying causes . If at first you don't succeed: The cape wearing fan had tried his field rushing stunt at an Orioles game in April . After . the game, the coach claimed he accidentally bumped into the ref when he . was trying to get the man's attention to call a time-out. 'I . guess I didn't understand how he interpreted it, but what we're told is . to get the timeout where they can see it in front of their face in . those situations,' Harbaugh, 50, told reporters after the game. 'That's . what I've been told for five years going into this game. I think he . took it as bumping him. I didn't mean to bump him. I wanted to call a . timeout, so I apologize for bumping, but the intent was to call a . timeout.' But Sunday's coach/ref scuffles are just the latest in the replacement ref controversy. The . NFL locked out the regular officials this June, after their contract . expired, and negotiations with the NFL Referees Association over salary . and benefits have yielded little progress. This is the first time since 2001 that backups have been called in and fans, coaches and players have been complaining that the substitutes are not passing muster. Rookie: Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker kicks the game-winning field goal in the final moments of the Ravens/Patriots game in Baltimore on Sunday . Victory: Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, left, celebrates his game-winning field goal with teammate Arthur Jones after the Ravens win . Sunday's game seemed like a comedy of errors - starting with a streaking fan whose mission who strutted his stuff but all in the name of charity, he claims. The . intruder, Mark Harvey, stormed the field donning a cape emblazoned with . the face of Ellen DeGeneres, a baseball cap and briefs, in footage uploaded to YouTube, in order . to raise awareness of the dangers of bullying. Harvey has pulled this stunt before, at an Orioles game in April, and he even has a website to raise awareness for his anti-bullying efforts. After the streaking side-show and the call against Harbaugh ignited the crowd, a last minute move by the Ravens further set off a coach, this time for the opposing team. The . Ravens ended up winning the game by 31-30 but only after Baltimore . rookie Justin Tucker kicked a 27-yard field goal that barely landed . within bounds. Refs ruled Tucker's goal was in but the Patriots weren't having in. Patriots . coach Bill Belichick openly questioned the ruling and grabbed a ref by . the arm, angrily opposing what he called an arbitrary ruling, as the official walked off the field. Bittersweet: Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Torrey Smith reacts after kicker Justin Tucker kicked the winning field goal on Sunday. Smith chose to play in the game though his younger brother died over the weekend . The incident could earn Belichick a fine but he played down the controversy at a post-game press conference. 'That's . what we're going to try to work on. Talk to the officials about the way . they called the game. Talk to the league about the way they called it. I . don't know. But we just have to go out there and try to play the best . we can,' he said. If he is fined, he won't be the first coach to face a punishment for appealing a ref's decision this season. Denver . Broncos coach John Fox and Atlanta Falcons coach Jack Del Rio were . slapped with a league fine of $20,000 for arguing with officials on the . sidelines last Monday. With . the ref controversy playing out, the NFL released a . statement last week in support of the replacements - praising them for . 'performing admirably' and telling coaches and players that abuse of the . field officials won't be tolerated. 'Officiating . is never perfect. The current officials have made great strides and are . performing admirably under unprecedented scrutiny and great pressure. As we do every season, we will work to improve officiating and are . confident that the game officials will show continued improvement,' the . statement said. In mourning: Ravens wide receiver Torrey Smith, whose 19-year-old brother died over the weekend, chose to play despite his personal tragedy. He scored two touchdowns for the Ravens on Sunday . 'I don't care what the league fines me, these [replacement] refs are terrible,' one unnamed NFL head coach told ESPN. On a somber note, the Ravens community savored Sunday's victory in support of their wide receiver Torrey Smith. Smith's . 19-year-old brother, Tevin Jones, was killed in a motorcycle accident . over the weekend and he chose to still proceed in the game and ended . up scoring two touchdowns for his team. 'It . was tough emotionally. I didn't know how I would hold up. I was telling . my teammates a minute ago that this is new territory for me personally.

A woman who was sexually abused as a child by a family friend has spoken out about her ordeal in court as her attacker was jailed. Sally Maby, 37, was just 10-years-old when she was targeted by Mark James, now 54, who befriended her through a church in Bristol in the 1980s and then abused her. Now, nearly thirty years later and as James was jailed for the offences on Friday, Miss Maby has waived her right to anonymity in the hope that it will give others the strength to come forward and report similar offences. Torment: Sally Maby was sexually abused as a child by a family friend who she met at her local church . James, living in Filton, Bristol, at the time of the offences, was so manipulative and cunning that Miss . Maby had convinced herself he was 'amazing' and was so confused she . believed him to be her first boyfriend. At the time Miss Maby was particularly vulnerable because her parents had split up and she said it 'sickened' her that James was the first man she kissed. She only found the strength to come forward to police after James was convicted last year for assaults against other youngsters and was jailed for 46 months. Shortly before his trial was due to start James admitted a further 14 counts of sexual activity with children. On Friday at Bristol Crown Court he was jailed for a further 14 months for abuse carried out against Miss Maby and three other victims, who cannot be named. Judge Julian Lambert told him: 'You are cunning and manipulative and must never be allowed near children again. 'You are wicked and spoilt the childhood of a number of girls and the sentence I impose will do nothing to put that right.' Predator: Mark James, 54, was jailed for a further 14 months on top of his 46 months after admitting a further 14 counts of sexual activity with children . As well as being jailed he is subject to an indefinite sexual prevention order barring him from working or living with anybody under the age of 16. He must also not enter any school premises or playgrounds or loiter within 15 metres. He is on the sexual offender register for life. The historic nature of the offences meant the judge was bound by old sentencing guidelines.

Cuts: Claire Perry, MP for Devizes, arriving at the Crescent Centre, Bristol, for the start of the tribunal . A Tory MP today told an employment tribunal she sacked her best friend from a constituency office job because she was 'incapable' of carrying out her role. Claire Perry, MP for Devizes, Wiltshire, who has regularly spoken up for the Coalition’s austerity program, made a cut of her own when Penelope Nurick lost her job in a 'staff reshuffle'. Mrs Nurick was one of Mrs Perry’s seconders when she stood as the Conservative Party candidate in 2010, and had worked in her office for two years. She was formally sacked from her administrative role on February 23 2012 when Mrs Perry, 48, replaced her with another employee in the constituency office. Mrs Nurick launched legal proceedings against best friend Mrs Perry following the decision, claiming she had been 'unfairly dismissed' by the MP. Mrs Perry told a tribunal in Bristol that she was forced to fire her friend after senior advisor Christopher Jones, left his job in November 2011. The MP said she was unable to replace Mr Jones and so decided to split his extensive job role between her London and Devizes offices. She hired Tamara Ray - who was able to cover both policy and ‘surgery only’ roles - in her Devizes office at the expense of Mrs Nurick. 'It was clear from our early experiences that she [Mrs Nurick] would struggle with more responsibility,' Mrs Perry told the hearing. 'The claimant required a lot of managing and support, particularly in the IT area and all of this lead me to believed that this would not be something she would not be able to do, she would be incapable. 'I could not afford to keep Mrs Nurick on doing a surgery only job and employ someone to do a local policy job. I found someone who could do both.' Mrs Perry said budgetary constraints from Westminster meant that she could only employ a limited number of staff members for her constituency. 'What I had realised was that I needed to have more local policy placement,' she added. 'With Mr Jones leaving there was a vacuum at the top of my team and I had decided that there was a restructuring that needed to happen. 'As a result of all of those changes I realised I couldn’t keep Mrs Nurick on in her role. 'I can only employ three and a half staff per 100,000 constituents. 'Everybody’s job has changed in London and the local office, there was a very substantial reshuffle.' Mrs Perry, who is comprehensively-educated, succeeded former Conservative chairman Michael Ancram as the MP for Devizes. Last year she raised eyebrows in the House of Commons tea room when she asked whether she needed to perform  sex act on John Bercow before he would allow her to be heard. The Speaker had previously ‘overlooked’ Mrs Perry in a debate on tuition fees.

Greatly missed: Jordan Cobby, from Nuneaton, died aged 14 last March after a long battle with cancer. Friends of a 14-year-old boy who died after a long battle with cancer are being sent home from school for refusing to remove wristbands worn in his memory. Jordan Cobby, from Nuneaton, was diagnosed with a tumour behind his eye in 2008 and died aged 14 last March . Tribute wristbands in memory of Jordan were sold at his school, the Nuneaton Academy, following his death, with all proceeds donated to the Teenage Cancer Trust charity. Friends of the teenager bought the . bands and have worn them ever since, but now the school has banned . pupils from wearing them, saying they are not part of the uniform, his . mother Joanne Meuse said. One pupil, a close friend of Jordan’s, has even been sent home for refusing to remove the wristband. While . the school has offered a compromise, saying it will pay for a cover, . designed by the pupils, for their planners in memory of Jordan, Mrs . Meuse said the wristbands have sentimental value. The . 45-year-old, from Nuneaton, said: 'Jordan was a former pupil of the . Nuneaton Academy and was, still is, a much-loved and valued friend of . these students. 'When he . passed away in March 2011 from cancer, I and my family found a great . deal of comfort from the many thoughts and actions of these young . people. They showed great compassion and a maturity far beyond their . years. 'They are a credit . to the Nuneaton Academy. They gave and continue to do so, a sincere . commitment to fundraising for the Teenage Cancer Trust and I believe the . positive feeling this created has helped them to deal with their grief. 'All of them should be congratulated for . having such strong and caring values. The Nuneaton Academy should . recognise this, encourage and be very proud of them.' Offending articles: The wristbands were sold at the school following Jordan's death in March last year with all proceeds donated to the Teenage Cancer Trust charity . Mrs Meuse said the school had been . happy for the children to wear the bands for the last 18 months and it . was only in the last few weeks she had heard of pupils being told to . remove them or face disciplinary action. She . added: 'The bands do not affect their learning but it is their way of . showing respect and keeping a part of Jordan with them. A . quote from one of Jordan’s friends was ‘I write with my right hand and . my band is on my left, when I am struggling or going through a tough . time, I just look at my band and remember what a brave hero Jordan was . and all that he went through’.' The school principal, Helen McEvoy, told her last week that she was unaware the pupils had been wearing the bands. 'If that is the case, then it proves the point that the bands are unobtrusive and not distracting in any way', Mrs Meuse said. She . added: 'I am very angry and shocked but even more so heartbroken for . the students, that after all these months have passed, they are now . being asked or rather told to remove their bands by Mrs McEvoy, which I . believe is bad judgment and leadership. What is this teaching the . students?' Zoe Ashby, whose . son Harris was a friend of Jordan’s, said she was disgusted when the . school rang to say her son was being sent home for refusing to take off . his wristband. Nuneaton Academy banned pupils from wearing the bands saying they are not part of the uniform . Ms Ashby said: 'I don’t think the headteacher realises how much Jordan’s death affected them. The bands have sentimental value and mean so much to the kids. 'My son Harris played football with Jordan since they were seven and this morning I got a call from the school to say he was being sent home as he had refused to take the band off. It’s just ridiculous.' Kay Southall, whose son Daniel was a close friend of Jordan’s and attends the academy, has launched a petition urging the school to rethink the wristband ban. Some 350 parents and children have already signed. Mrs Southall said: 'The children aren’t being difficult. They went on a journey with Jordan from the time he was diagnosed and just want to keep him with them until June next year when they finish school, just as he would’ve been had he not been cruelly taken. 'I’m extremely proud of all the lads and girls that are making a stand for something they truly believe to be wrong. 'Their commitment to honouring Jordan’s memory and their support for Joanne and the rest of the family is humbling. 'I look forward to that phone call home, as do the rest of the parents because we fully support and admire the stance our kids are taking' No one was available at the school for comment.","Wristbands were sold at the school with all proceeds donated to the Teenage Cancer Trust charity .

David Cameron today shrugged off reports 14 Conservative MPs have launched a secret plot to oust him as Tory leader. The Prime Minister went ahead with a visit to a Sony warehouse, destroyed in last year's riots, amid reports of a 'drip, 'drip' process to challenge his leadership. It is understood the 14 have written to Graham Brady, chairman of the powerful backbench 1922 Committee, demanding a leadership contest. Prime Minister David Cameron was today shown round the warehouse by General Manager of Sony UK Natasha Tyrell . Shipping out? David Cameron today visited the Sony Digital Audio Disc Corporation (DADC) warehouse in Enfield, north London which was damaged by fire during last year's riots . Under Tory rules a contest is automatically triggered if 15 per cent of the party’s MPs write letters to Mr Brady calling for the leader to go. The 14 letters, reported in the Spectator magazine, which has close links to the Tories, remain well short of the 46 needed to trigger a leadership contest. But, because of a quirk in the rules, the letters remain on file indefinitely, meaning that Mr Cameron could face a ‘drip, drip’ process of discontent. Today the PM was shown round the newly-reopened Sony Digital Audio Disc Corporation (DADC) warehouse in Enfield, north London which was set on fire during the riots last summer. Allies played down the significance of the revolt against the PM, noting that making spending cuts while being in coalition was always going to be unpopular with some sections of the Tory party. A source said: 'He is getting on with the job, as usual.' Heading for the exit: The PM has shrugged off talk of a challenge to his leadership, with allies noting that making spending cuts was always going to be unpopular . Rebel Tories and loyalists alike dismissed claims that an organised coup was under way. One rebel MP said there was no serious threat to the Prime Minister’s position for now because there was no alternative leader waiting in the wings. But he said the situation could change if Mr Cameron failed to turn round the party’s fortunes before the next election, or if London Mayor Boris Johnson, viewed by some as a possible future leader, returns to the Commons. ‘There is no organised campaign against the Prime Minister at the moment,’ he said. ‘You could easily get 46 names if there was an alternative leader, but there isn’t. If Boris was here things might be very different. On the up: Mayor of London Boris Johnson's popularity has continued to rise, and should he return to the Commons he could be a potential Tory leader . ‘But if we find ourselves running towards a cliff like lemmings as the next election approaches then the party would change leadership overnight. It is that brutal.’ Loyalists also dismissed claims of a concerted move against the Prime Minister. Mr Brady last night declined to comment on the report. But he stressed that it was impossible for anyone else to know how many, if any, letters he had received from colleagues about the Prime Minister. ‘No-one other than me could possibly know because I do not discuss it with anyone,’ he said. Supporters of Mr Cameron attempted to toughen up the leadership rules before the last election by raising the threshold for triggering a contest and placing a time limit on letters sent to Mr Brady. But the move was abandoned after the Tories failed to win a majority at the election.","Up to 14 MPs have signed letters calling for the Prime Minister to go, according to reports .

Shocking: Petty thief Thomas Cato, 23, is responsible for half of all the recorded crimes in his hometown - but was still spared jail following his latest offence . Criminal Cato pleaded guilty to stealing the pie and pair of Marigolds, valued at just £2.29p, from his local Co-Op store. But his solicitor Nicola Jones told the court yesterday it would be 'disproportionate' to receive a jail sentence for shoplifting. She said Cato had mental health problems which had only recently been diagnosed. Miss Jones said: 'It will be to the town's benefit if my client stops offending. 'Six months ago I spoke to the police who told me that my client was responsible for half of the recorded crimes in Dolgellau.' Controversial: Cato was caught pilfering a meat pie and a pair of rubber gloves - while on a suspended custodial sentence for burglary. But he was still not sent to prison . Magistrates gave him 20 hours unpaid work for the breach and 20 hours unpaid work for the shoplifting charge. No court costs were imposed after it was heard he still owed £3,000 in unpaid fines and compensation dating back to 2009. Speaking to the Daily Express, Tory MP Philip Davies criticised the court's decision. 'These magistrates are fools to themselves and are making a fool of the British justice system.

Takeaways can contain more than three times the amount of salt an adult should eat in an entire day. Pizzas and Chinese food had the highest levels, in a survey of 215 independent food outlets. Researchers from Liverpool John Moores University described the levels as 'alarmingly high'. High salt levels: Takeaways can contain more than three times the amount of salt an adult should eat in an entire day. Pizzas and Chinese food had the highest levels, in a survey of 215 independent food outlets . NHS guidelines recommend adults should eat no more than six grams of salt a day – around a teaspoon. But the survey found pizzas had the highest salt content with an average of 9.45 grams. Chinese had an average of 8.1 grams, followed by kebabs with 6.2 grams, Indian with 4.7 grams and English with 2.2 grams. The average pepperoni pizza meal had . 12.94 grams of salt, followed by seafood pizza with an average 11 grams, . and Margherita at 8.8 grams. Ham and pineapple had the lowest, 7.7 . grams. 'The present study is one of the first designed to evaluate the salt content in hot takeaway meals and obtained results show that salt concentration in these kinds of food is alarmingly high,' the researchers told the journal Appetite. 'As voluntary guidelines regarding salt reduction do not result in adequate changes, some statutory regulation to lower salt in takeaway foods should be considered.' 'To enable the UK population to meet the . recommended daily salt intake a significant reduction in the salt . content of hot takeaway meals should be considered.' Unhealthy: English food came out with the lowest amounts of salt - chicken and chips, two grams, and fish and chips three grams . The researchers said that a change in the law may be needed to make pizza outlets, kebab shops other small fast food outlets produce healthier meals. There has been growing health concerns over the levels of salt in food. It has been linked to a higher risk of high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke, as well as kidney stones, stomach cancer, asthma and osteoporosis. It has been estimated that lowering salt intakes by only 10 per cent results in a reduction of 6,000 cardiovascular deaths in the UK, with a saving to the economy of £1.5 billion a year. NHS Livewell recommendations are that adults should eat no more than six grams of salt a day - around one full teaspoon - but the problem is that 75 per cent of the salt eaten is contained in processed food and takeaway and other meals bought outside the home, which makes it difficult to ration. A number of studies have looked at the salt content of supermarket products, but the researchers say that with a growing number of people eating takeaways - 22 per cent of people buy a takeaway at least once a week - there is an urgent need to investigate salt content. The study, being reported in the Journal Appetite this week, looked at salt levels in popular hot takeaway meals bought at small, independent outlets in Merseyside and the north west. Chinese takeaways: The average beef green peppers and black bean sauce with fried rice had nearly 11 grams of salt, while sweet and sour chicken with boiled rice had little more than three . There were wide variations in the Chinese meals. The average beef green peppers and black bean sauce with fried rice had nearly 11 grams of salt, while sweet and sour chicken with boiled rice had little more than three. 'Some Chinese meals contained more than three times the UK salt target,' said the report. `'A single portion of beef and black bean with fried rice contained 27 g of salt and a single portion of prawn chow mein contained 21 g of salt per portion.' In Indian food, an average portion of chicken tikka masala with keema rice had a salt concentration of nearly seven grams, which was 50 per cent higher than most other Indian dishes. An average doner kebab and chips had 6.5 grams, while a typical Shish kebab had not much more than four. English food came out with the lowest amounts - chicken and chips, two grams, and fish and chips three grams. However, the figures do not take into account that many people like to sprinkle salt on their chips. The researchers said that while big chains are co-operating with guidelines on reducing salt content, there is little interest from small, independent outlets. 'The fact that salt is a cheap ingredient which can make food palatable at a very small cost may be one of reasons why the private catering sector are reluctant to cooperate. 'The present study is one of the first designed to evaluate the salt content in hot takeaway meals from small independent outlets in the UK, and obtained results show that salt concentration in these kinds of food is alarmingly high.'","Pizzas and Chinese food had the highest levels, in a survey of 215 independent food outlets .

Jailed: Rachel Hewitt, 39, pictured outside court at an earlier hearing, was jailed for 18 months today for her 'pack of lies' When police officer Rachel Hewitt told bosses her teenage daughter was desperately ill with cancer they did everything they could to help. She was given compassionate leave, favourable shifts and time off sick – because of depression – as her daughter was battling for her life, a court was told. It went on for two years but, incredibly, it was all a sham. Hewitt, 39, invented the cancer story so she could go to show jumping events with her two daughters, who were both fit and well. Yesterday she was jailed for 18 months for abusing the trust of her police employers and the colleagues who donated cash to help her supposedly sick child. Judge Simon Jack said her actions ‘undermined the trust the police have in each other’ as well as the ‘trust the public has in the police’. He told Hewitt: ‘You told lies on top of lies over a long period. It was prolonged and cynical lying. ‘The type of lies you told were so emotive about a child having cancer no one would think they were false. That is why you were able to get away with it for so long.’ Hewitt had claimed daughter Natasha, 15, had to have chemotherapy and an operation to remove a tumour. She also told colleagues that the teenager was treated in a hospital intensive care unit and was feared to be terminally ill. Bosses did not check her story or ask for documentation because no one believed the married mother-of-two would lie about such a thing, Hull Crown Court heard. In reality Hewitt was devoting her time and energy to the budding equestrian careers of Natasha and sister Jessica, 13. The traffic constable with the North Yorkshire force started the scam in September 2009 and was not caught out until October 2011. Con: Hull Crown Court heard that she had gained large sums of money from her deception . Instead of being in hospital or . nursing her sick daughter, as she claimed, Hewitt was travelling to show . jumping competitions. She also took a total of five months off sick, . claiming to be depressed, at a cost to taxpayers of up to £15,000. Lies: Hewitt spent most of her time developing the bugging equestrians careers of teenage daughters .

The Olympic cauldron was extinguished last night as the flame was relocated to another part of the stadium. The flame's cauldron, a symbol of the Olympic movement, is supposed to burn for the entirety of the Games but organisers have confirmed it was put out temporarily so the 28ft high structure could be moved to the edge of the stadium. This revelation will add to controversy about the location of the flame, which is only visible to those who have tickets to events in the main stadium. The Olympic cauldron after the flame had been extinguished last night. It was put out about 9pm and re-lit in its new position at 7.50am this morning . LOCOG chairman Sebastian Coe said last night that the cauldron was 'not created to be a tourist attraction' and would not go on public view. The steel and copper Thomas Heatherwick-designed cauldron was lit by seven young athletes at the opening ceremony on Friday, at the culmination of a 70-day torch relay which covered 8,000 miles and all corners of Britain. It was extinguished at 9pm last night and re-lit at 7.50am this morning, after the flame was kept burning in a miners' lamp overnight. It will take 80 hours to ready the stadium for athletics events. It now stands at the southern end of the stadium, ahead of the finish line for the 100m and in the same place where a giant bell marked the start of the Opening Ceremony. Jackie Brock-Doyle, director of communications for the organising committee, said: 'The cauldron has been put out while we move it to another part of the stadium.' She added that the flame would be kept burning in a lantern, also used during parts of the torch relay, and the cauldron relit on Monday morning. Giant cranes move in to move the cauldron from the centre of the Olympic stadium, where it was lit during Friday night's Opening Ceremony . The decision to have the cauldron inside the stadium for the duration of the Games is controversial, with organisers saying it is not designed to be a 'tourist attraction' It was nearly midnight when the cranes moved into position to move to cauldron . Austin Playfoot, 82, re-lit the cauldron on Monday with the aid of a cherry picker . The honour went to 82-year-old Austin Playfoot from Elstead in Surrey, who was a torchbearer at the 1948 London Olympic Games. Back then, he ran 1.8 miles with the flame through Guildford, but here he was aided by a cherry picker. Mr Playfoot described his role as an 'honour', adding: 'When I ran with the Olympic Flame in Guildford I never thought I would get this close to the Cauldron, it brought me to tears when it lit up. 'It will be an incredible inspiration to the competing athletes here at the heart of the Olympic Park in the Stadium.' It is not the first time the cauldron has been concealed from public view. It was not open to the public in 1948, the last time the Games were staged in London. The new position of the cauldron will ensure track and field athletics events can take place in the stadium . The Olympic cauldron is lit during Friday night's Opening Ceremony. The 28ft high cauldron is made up of 204 engraved leaves to represent each of nations participating at the Games . And a fierce row erupted at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics when organisers fenced off the cauldron and positioned security guards in front of it, preventing large numbers of visitors a look at it. After a backlash from Canadians, officials were forced to remove some of the protection and allow more visitor-friendly access. The cauldron is made up of 204 steel pipes and individually designed copper petals inscribed with each country's name. Its designer Mr Heatherwick said: 'There is the precedent of the 1948 Games of the cauldron set within the stadium, to one side with the spectators, and with the technology we now have that didn’t exist in 1948 it can be shared with everyone in the Olympic Park with screens.'We felt that sharing it with the screens reinforced the intimacy within it. If it had been a huge beacon lifted up in the air it would have had to be bigger, and would have somehow not met the brief that we discussed with Danny Boyle of making something that was rooted in where the people are.'The cauldron is to be dismantled after the Games and each of the copper petals will be returned to the competing 204 National Olympic Committees to keep. In the last London Olympics in 1948, the flame was kept burning inside Wembley Stadium for the whole of the Games . The flame burned high above the stadium at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney . A bird's eye view of the Olympic Park taken for Google Earth. The aerial imagery of the Park in Stratford, East London was updated by Google just before the Opening Ceremony . Day three of the Olympics started in perfect fashion for Great Britain as Katherine Grainger (front) and Anna Watkins won their heat of the double sculls in an Olympic Record time. The double world champions set a time of six minutes 44.33 seconds, smashing the previous record by five seconds. Grainger and Watkins, who are the clear favourites for a gold medal, are now unbeaten in 22 races. Grainger has three consecutive Olympic silver medals, but on this form, she is likely to be on top of the podium at Eton Dorney after the final on Friday . The British men's eight qualified for their final after holding off the challenge of Canada, Holland and Australia in this morning's repechage. The crew, who have only been training together for six weeks after a member withdrew through injury, quickly opened up a commanding lead over reigning Olympic champions Canada. Their challengers closed the gap but Britain maintained a high stroke rate to earn their spot in Wednesday's final . Zoe Smith set a new British record for the weightlifting clean and jerk today, though her effort of 121kg is unlikely to win her a medal. The 18-year-old from Greenwich fell narrowly short of her personal best in the snatch portion of the event, registering 90kg. But, roared on by an electric home crowd, she redemmed herself in the clean and jerk for an overall total of 211kg. However, the elite lifters in the A group are likely to eclipse her current standing of second.","Cauldron is put out temporarily as it is moved from the centre of the stadium .

A Crocs co-founder was arrested and charged with drunken driving in a bizarre confrontation where he allegedly blamed country crooner Taylor Swift - who was thousands of miles away. The trouble began for George Boedecker, 51, on Sunday when the entrepreneur was discovered slumped over the wheel of a black Porsche in Boulder, Colorado. Police and paramedics said that when . Boedecker got out of the car, which was partially on the sidewalk, he . had trouble keeping his balance and was slurring his words. A witness told police that Boedecker had gotten out of the car, and first said that he had pulled over to take a nap. He later changed his story completely, saying that his girlfriend had been driving, and she is 'bats*** crazy.' Boedecker, whose other business ventures . include Domino's Pizza and Quizno’s, was approached by an officer, who . asked what had happened. A police report obtained by TheSmokingGun.com said that Boedecker told the officer that his girlfriend had been driving, and she ran away after the two had an argument. When asked about the girlfriend, Boedecker told the officer that she is a singer who is 'really f****** famous.' He then asked if the officer had ever heard of Taylor Swift. When the officer pressed for information about where the girlfriend went, Boedecker allegedly motioned toward a neighbouring backyard, and then said 'Taylor' was in Nashville. The officer wrote that Boedecker then became agitated, saying he was done with the questions that that things were about to get 'mid-evil.' Famous footwear: Boedecker is one of the founders of Crocs . Shortly after that, Boedecker was arrested, but he apparently was not done talking, as the officer noted that the philanthropist told him and another responding officer to 'go f*** themselves in the a**' and that he hoped the cop would 'f****** die.' Unfortunately for Boedecker and his story, Swift was in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, at the time of his arrest with her actual boyfriend Conor Kennedy and his family - about 2,000 miles away. And while Swift has dated such A-listers as Jake Gyllenhaal, Taylor Lautner, and John Mayer, there is no evidence to suggest she has ever been romantically linked to Boedecker. On Monday, however, she was in Nashville, announcing plans to release her fourth studio album - 'Red' - on October 22. Boedecker is not believed to have ever been romantically linked to Taylor Swift . She said during a live web chat that the album is all about emotions. Swift said: 'They're all pretty much about the kind of tumultuous, crazy, insane, intense, semi-toxic relationships that I've experienced in the last two years.' She added: 'All those emotions spanning from intense love, intense frustration, jealousy, confusion, all of that, in my mind all those emotions are red. There's nothing in between. 'There's nothing beige about any of those feelings.'","George Boedecker charged with DUI in bizarre arrest .

The search giant is selling early models of its Google Glass augmented reality glasses this week for $1,500 to a select group of developers. The glasses are designed to let users capture video with a built-in camera as well as use apps, the internet, and social networking sites on the move. A small projector displays an image in front of the wearer's eyes while letting them stay aware on the outside world. The idea is to bypass computers, tablets and smartphones entirely and keep the user connected in a (fairly) discreet way. Scroll down for video demonstration . Ready for sale: Selected software developers have chance to pay $1,500 to order an advance version of Google Glass, which was displayed by co-founder Sergey Brin at the Google I/O conference on Wednesday . Success: Two stunt riders delivered a Google Glass to go-founder Sergey Brin after a spectacular demonstration that was streamed live through the devices . The glasses seem likely to appeal to runners, bicyclists and other athletes who want to take pictures of their activities as they happen. Photos and video can be programmed to be taken at automatic intervals during any activity. Brin said he became excited about the project when he tossed his son in the air and a picture taken by the glasses captured the joyful moment, just the way he saw it. 'That was amazing,' Brin said. 'There was no way I could have that memory without this device.' Google points out that this is experimental technology, and a first generation device. But for those who want the cutting-edge, and are willing to try something new, the glasses offer a potentially revolutionary way of communicating. With the glasses, directions to your . destination or a text message from a friend can appear literally before . your eyes. You can converse with friends in a video chat, take a photo . or even buy a few things online as you walk around. In . development for more than two years, the project is the brainchild of . Google X, the online search leader's secret facility that spawned the . self-driving car and could one day let people ride elevators into space. Isabelle . Olsson, an engineer on the Glass project, said the company created the . glasses for people to interact with the virtual world without . distracting them from the physical world. It is designed to interact . closely with your senses, without blocking them. She . said Google had two broad goals in mind: communications through images . and quick access to information. The device has a camera to capture . fleeting moments and allow others to see the world through your eyes. Extreme: The Glass demonstration was meant to prove that the device is ready for users to begin testing it and pushing its limits . Going down: A team rappelled down the side of the conference center and filmed the stunt using their Glass eyepieces . The . Glass wasn't Google's only big product announcement at its 2010 I/O . conference. The search giant signalled it was likely to begin competing . directly with Apple and Samsung with the launch of several new devices . and features. Nexus 7 . This . is Google's entry into the tablet market. For $200, the system runs the . company's Android operating system. It is built to give consumers an . alternative to the iPad. Nexus Q . This . black sphere plugs into the TV and allows users to stream videos from . the Google Play store and YouTube. At $300, it costs three times what . Apple TV does, although Nexus Q is made in America. Android 4.1 - 'Jellybean' A . new version of its smart phone operating system is meant to look and . feel more 'streamlined.' It also offers a version of Apple's 'Siri' along with voice control. Brin told reporters that Google . intends to sell the glasses for significantly less once the product is . released to the mass market. He said Google hopes to start selling the . device to consumers in early 2014. 'I think we are definitely pushing the limits,' Brin said during a question-and-answer session with reporters. 'That is our job: to push edges of technology into the future.' The company showed that users are ready . to start testing the limits of its new product with a dramatic . demonstration. Daredevils skydived from a blimp above the annual Google . I/O conference onto the roof, then abseiled down the side of the . building - all broadcast live to the conference from souped-up versions of the Glass. Google is offering the first shot at . the the device, known as Project Glass, to people attending the San . Fancisco gathering for computer programmers. It will ship early next year and won't be available for sale outside the three-day conference, which started Wednesday. 'This is new technology and we really want you to shape it,' Google co-founder Sergey Brin told about 6,000 attendees. 'We want to get it out into the hands of passionate people as soon as possible.' Experience: Google has already released a sneak-peak at the user-interface for the Glass, which broadcasts data directly in front of the eye, bypassing cell phones . The demonstration shows off a weather forecast layered over a view of the world . The demonstration shows off navigation information similar to what Google currently offers via its Maps service . Then, another team took over and rode BMX stunt bikes over a ramp, which led to a team rappelling down the side of the building. Finally, another stunt cyclist delivered one of the devices into the conference auditorium and into Brin's hands. But for all the dramatic stunts, the demonstration showed only that Google Glass is durable and capable of streaming video. It offered no glimpse of the device's functionality or user interface. Google had given a glimpse of the technology in a video posted earlier this year.","Glass is only available to software developers who order it at the Google I/O conference this week .

Google has taken tourism to the next level by allowing people from around the world to see monuments like Stonehenge, the streets of Pompeii and the remote landscapes of Antarctica from the comfort of their own living room. Now the company is allowing users to explore Mexico's ancient Mayan ruins through their digital devices after adding dozens of sites to Google Street View. Google used a three wheeled trike to ride around Mayan monuments to capture 360 degree images for its Street View project. This is Chichen Itza, a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya civilization. Users will be able to interact with a multitude of images from pre-Hispanic sites on the Street View feature that is incorporated into Google Maps. Google Mexico and Mexico's National . Institute of Anthropology and History announced yesterday  that 30 sites . have been added to Street View so far. However, dozens more will be coming online this year and the target is to reach 90 sites. The world-famous sites already online include Chichen Itza, Uman - Hopelchen, Teotihuacan (the world's third largest pyramid) and Monte Alban. Today, the Maya and their descendants form large populations throughout the Maya area where they maintain a distinctive set of traditions and beliefs. The heart of the Mayan civilization lies further south in Honduras, Guatemala, and western El Salvador, more than 1,000 km (620 mi) from Mexico. Mayan ruins in Chetumal, the capital of Quintana Roo, and one of thirty key Mayan sites Google has added to its Street View project. Street View allows users to click on map . locations to obtain 360-degree, interactive images composed of millions . of photos taken at street level by specially equipped vehicles. Campaigners have warned that privacy risks being sacrificed in a commercial race between Google and its rival Apple, which unveiled its latest mapping technology yesterday. The two are competing to produce three-dimensional maps and have deployed spy planes to photograph streets and homes. The planes will be able to operate in British skies without special licensing or permits. Google has also used its Street View cars to gather ground-level panoramic photographs. Chichen Itza is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico with an estimated 1.2 million tourists visit the ruins every year. Google allows pictures taken by tourists to be overlaid onto the pictures from its trike . Street View allows users to zoom in and focus on specific points within the Mayan sites .

Google uses a special, three-wheeled bicycle to photograph some of the hardest to reach places on the planet. The Street View trike, as it is known, has been sent around the world to reach remote places that cars can't get to. They carry the same camera equipment usually found on Google's fleet of Vauxhall Astras which have been touring Britain taking shots for the service. The bike allows Google to collect 360° horizontal and . 290° vertical panoramic street level views using special cameras. They capture and match images to a specific location using GPS devices. Once the images are captured, they are 'sewn' together to create a 360° panorama. Users can search Street View by entering a specific address, or pulling the yellow 'Pegman' icon to the area they want to see. One of the sites featured is Palenque; a former Mayan city in Southern Mexico that flourished in the 7th century . The Mayans lived between 2000BC to 250AD.

They may have been bitter enemies during the Cold War space race, but these days the U.S. and Russia work together to transport astronauts through the cosmos. And it's just as well - for since the demise of the space shuttle programme last year, NASA has been forced to piggy-back off other countries rockets for its space expeditions. This enforced co-operation was on show on Sunday, when American Sunita Williams joined colleagues from Russia and Japan on a Soyuz capsule headed to the International Space Station for a four-month mission. Scroll down for video . We have lift off: The Soyuz TMA-05M rocket launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan yesterday morning carrying three astronauts nearly 250 miles above the Earth to the International Space Station . Ms Williams, Yuri Malenchenko and Akihiko Hoshide launched successfully from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 0240 GMT. They are scheduled to berth early on . Tuesday, joining Nasa Flight Engineer Joseph Acaba and Russian . cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Revin aboard the ISS. 'The Soyuz had a very smooth ride into space,' a spokesman for Nasa said during a live broadcast on the agency's television channel. The Soyuz TMA-05M rocket blazed a bright orange trail through cloudy skies above the Kazakh steppe on the first stage of its journey to the ISS, a $100billion research complex orbiting 240 miles above Earth. Moscow hopes a successful mission will help to restore confidence in its once-pioneering space programme after a string of launch mishaps last year, including the failure of a mission to return samples from the Martian moon Phobos. The previous Soyuz launch on May 15 was delayed by more than a month after an accident during pressure tests damaged the Soyuz crew capsule. There were no such delays with Sunday's launch. Expensive trip: The U.S. is dependent on Russia's Soyuz TMA-05M rockets to carry personnel to the ISS since it scrapped its space shuttle programme last year . 'The most tense, the most difficult part (of the launch) has been successfully implemented,' said Vladimir Popovkin, head of Russian space agency Roscosmos. 'I have just spoken to the crew. They are feeling great,' Russian news agencies quoted Popovkin as saying in Baikonur. 'I have no doubts that all will go according to plan.' Colonel Malenchenko, a 50-year-old cosmonaut on his fifth space voyage, loosened his straps about 20 minutes after blast-off after conducting air pressure checks. Asked by Mission Control how the crew was feeling, he replied: 'Good.' A doll given to him by his daughter dangled from the roof of the capsule.

Sunday's launch took place less than three weeks after China's Shenzhou 9 spacecraft returned to Earth, ending a mission that put the country's first woman in space. Although China is far from catching up with the United States and Russia, the Shenzhou 9 marked China's fourth manned space mission since 2003.

A core sample is retrieved: The iron stimulates plankton growth, which 'binds' carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere - getting rid of one of the gases which warms Earth's atmosphere . A ship dumping iron into the Southern Ocean has shown off a technique that could be the 'cure' for climate change. The iron stimulates plankton growth, which 'binds' carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere - getting rid of one of the gases which warms Earth's atmosphere. A trial, called Eifex, has been hailed a success, after a bloom of plankton sank 1,000 metres below the ocean, taking with it carbon dioxide. At present, the technique could only . be used to 'mop up' around a tenth of global carbon emissions - but . scientists continue to investigate. 'We were able to prove that over 50 per cent of the plankton bloom sank . below 1000 metre depth indicating that their carbon content can be . stored in the deep ocean and in the underlying seafloor sediments for . time scales of well over a century,' says Prof. Dr. Victor Smetacek . from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in the . Helmholtz Association. Previous experiments which aimed to 'bind' carbon in this way failed. 'Such controlled iron fertilization experiments in the ocean enable us . to test hypotheses and quantify processes that cannot be studied in . laboratory experiments. The results improve our understanding of . processes in the ocean relevant to climate change' says Smetacek. 'The . controversy surrounding iron fertilization experiments has led to a . thorough evaluation of our results before publication' The iron stimulates plankton growth, which 'binds' carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere - getting rid of one of the gases which warms Earth's atmosphere . The experiments attempts to recreate conditions during previous ice ages. During past ice ages the air was . cooler and drier than it is today and more iron-containing dust was . transported from the continents to the ocean by the wind. The iron supply to marine . phytoplankton was hence higher during the ice ages. This natural process . is simulated in iron fertilisation experiments under controlled . conditions. Iron plays an important role in the . climate system. It is involved in many biochemical processes such as . photosynthesis and is hence an essential element for biological . production in the oceans and, therefore, for CO2 absorption from the . atmosphere. An international research team  published the results of an ocean iron fertilization experiment (EIFEX) carried out in 2004 in the current issue of the scientific journal Nature. Unlike the LOHAFEX experiment carried out in 2009, EIFEX has shown that a substantial proportion of carbon from the induced algal bloom sank to the deep sea floor. These results, which were thoroughly analyzed before being published now, provide a valuable contribution to our better understanding of the global carbon cycle.An international team on board the research vessel Polarstern fertilized in spring 2004 (i.e. at the end of the summer season in the southern hemisphere) a part of the closed core of a stable marine eddy in the Southern Ocean with dissolved iron, which stimulated the growth of unicellular algae (phytoplankton). The team followed the development of the phytoplankton bloom for five weeks from its start to its decline phase. The maximum biomass attained by the bloom was with a peak chlorophyll stock of 286 Milligram per square metre higher than that of blooms stimulated by the previous 12 iron fertilization experiments. The Eifex ship stimulated plankton growth using iron dumped into the water . According to Prof. Dr. Victor Smetacek  from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in the Helmholtz Association, this was all the more remarkable because the EIFEX bloom developed in a 100 metre deep mixed layer which is much deeper than hitherto believed to be the lower limit for bloom development.The bloom was dominated by diatoms, a group of algae that require dissolved silicon to make their shells and are known to form large, slimy aggregates with high sinking rates at the end of their blooms. These results contrast with those of the LOHAFEX experiment carried out in 2009 where diatom growth was limited by different nutrient conditions, especially the absence of dissolved silicon in the chosen eddy. Instead, the plankton bloom consisted of other types of algae which, however, have no protective shell and were eaten more easily by zooplankton. 'This shows how differently communities of organisms can react to the addition of iron in the ocean', says Dr. Christine Klaas. 'We expect similarly detailed insights on the transportation of carbon between atmosphere, ocean and sea bottom from the further scientific analysis of the LOHAFEX data"", adds Prof. Dr. Wolf-Gladrow, Head of Biosciences at the Alfred Wegener Institute, who is also involved in the Nature study.","Iron stimulates plankton growth .

Anthea Turner has broken her silence over claims her husband cheated on her with an interior designer less than half her age, revealing she's 'heartbroken and devastated'. The television presenter, 52, threw 50-year-old Grant Bovey out of their £5million marital home after being told he had been seen kissing country heiress Zoe de Mallet Morgan in a London restaurant. And today she spoke out about the reports by releasing a statement on the state of her marriage of 12 years. Devastated:  Anthea Turner, right, has been left ‘heartbroken’ over claims that her husband cheated on her with Zoe de Mallet Morgan, left . Turner revealed she is both . 'heartbroken' and 'devastated' over the breakdown of their relationship . and the affair rumours, but she declined to comment any further. Bovey's alleged romance with the . 24-year-old is said to have started while Miss Turner was working on a . TV show in Canada to help support her husband financially. A close friend of Miss Turner told the Mail that she confronted Mr Bovey last week after becoming suspicious about his behaviour. The friend said: ‘Anthea had  an inkling that Grant was having an affair. After a long talk, they decided they needed some distance between them and he has now moved out of their home. Anthea was in a very dazed and confused state at first, but now the anger is settling in and she is furious. ‘All I can think is that Grant is having some kind of mid-life crisis.’ Mr Bovey, who left his first wife, Della, for Miss Turner in 1998, is believed to have insisted that Miss de Mallet Morgan is merely a friend. He is understood to be staying at a London hotel while Miss Turner – who is being comforted by her stepdaughters Lily, 20, Amelia, 19, and Claudia, 16 – considers the future of their marriage. Mr Bovey declined to comment on the allegations when contacted by the Daily Mail yesterday. He said: ‘It’s concerning my private life, so I don’t have anything to say about it at all.’ Considering her future: Anthea Turner, with Grant Bovey, is said to be devastated . Miss de Mallet Morgan comes from wealthy country stock. Her parents Tommy and Louise – nicknamed Lulu – are millionaires and live in a picturesque hamlet near Godalming in Surrey. Yesterday, at the stunning family lodge, which is set in acres of land, a neighbour said: ‘The family are very private, but I understand that Zoe has got herself in a pickle.’ Mr de Mallet Morgan works at the top end of the property market for Savills, with a career portfolio that includes the sale of The Dorchester hotel in London. His wife is a health consultant, who was featured on the cover of Country Life magazine in 1976 when the couple’s engagement was announced. Their daughter has worked for interior design firm Roozels, where she has helped to fit out luxury properties in Mayfair and Kensington, since 2008. Miss Turner, who found fame on Blue Peter, before presenting breakfast programme GMTV, was once married to former Radio 1 DJ Peter Powell. But her golden girl image was shattered when it was disclosed she was having an affair with Mr Bovey, who was a family friend. She and Mr Bovey went on to marry but their wedding in 2000 was a public relations disaster when it was revealed the couple had signed a £450,000 contract to pose for a magazine shoot while eating a new chocolate bar. Miss Turner subsequently struggled to find mainstream presenting work and took part in Channel 4’s reality series Celebrity Big Brother in 2001. She and Mr Bovey moved into the property business, launching Imagine Homes, which became Britain’s biggest buy-to-let property firm. But it was one of the first victims  of the financial crisis when it went into administration in 2008 with debts of up to £50million. Mr Bovey was discharged from bankruptcy in March 2011 and a month later he and Miss Turner moved into their new multi-million-pound home in Esher, Surrey, where neighbours include England footballer John Terry and TV presenter Chris Tarrant. Two years ago, Miss Turner signed up to appear as a judge for Canadian reality series Dinner Party Wars, on Food Network Canada.

The friend added: ‘Anthea was the breadwinner in the family and while she’s been working as hard as she can, Grant has been doing this. ‘She wasn’t even away that much – she would go to Canada for three weeks at a time and then come back for two weeks. ‘Grant has yet to actually admit to cheating on Anthea, but the fact that he has moved out without an argument says volumes.’ A spokesman for Miss Turner said: ‘Anthea is heartbroken and asks for her privacy.’ Happier times: The pair married in 2000 after meeting two years earlier, when Grant left his wife for Anthea .

Comedian Russell Brand’s father was facing bankruptcy in court today after racking up £13,000 in unpaid rent on a Camden flat. Businessman Ron, 67, was granted a reprieve at court today after missing months of payments on the north London apartment he left last year. Brand told Guildford County Court today that he had now paid back £7,000 of the money he owes and would get the rest together within two weeks. Not close: Russell Brand's father Ron, left, has refused to put pressure on his millionaire son by asking for financial help . ‘I’ll pay the rest back in 14 days,’ he cheerfully told the judge. ‘I’ve got half of it in my jacket pocket.’ An ‘order of sale’ has been applied for . on his new home in Farnham, Surrey, which would force him to sell up to . pay the debt - but it is thought there is not enough equity in the flat . to cover the full amount. Deputy District Judge David Phillips, agreed not to proceed with the bankruptcy but warned him if the money was not paid by the two-week deadline he would have him back in court. ‘It’s really time this was sorted out,’ added Judge Phillips. Brand appeared without a lawyer to represent him. The claimants, Lownie Investments, were represented by Ms Sarah Clarke. Ms Clarke said she was satisfied with the offer made and the case was adjourned for two weeks. Brand has refused to put pressure on his millionaire son by asking for help. The pair have had a strained relationship in the past, but currently appear to be on good terms. Relationship ups and downs: Russell Brand, 37, is now dating Isabella Brewster following his divorce from singer Katy Perry last month . Ron walked out on his six-month-old son and wife Barbara at their modest home in ­Brentwood, Essex after six years of marriage. He  later blamed the failure of his marriage on the stress of working long hours as he tried to make a success of his photography studio business. Over the years, he was to try his hand at everything from selling water filters to market trading. After Barbara, he married twice more, each time to a woman more than 14 years his junior. He stayed in touch with Russell, taking him to his first West Ham game, and hiring him a prostitute in Thailand when he was 16 in a misguided attempt to introduce him to adulthood. ‘He is a very different character to me,’ Russell, 37, has said. ‘Supporting West Ham was one of the ways we bonded. ‘He is a typical working-class bloke, so football and women were the only things we had in common.’ Russell now lives in Los Angeles and is dating Isabella Brewster, sister of Fast and Furious star Jordana - his first serious ­relationship since his divorce from Katy Perry last month.","Comedian's father Ron moved out of the apartment in Camden last year .

As the search for signs of life on Mars gathers pace, scientists may soon be able to turn their focus on a whole new group of planets. For they have found that there are in fact many more habitable planets in the universe than previously thought. The traditional starting point for calculating the chances of finding extra-terrestrial life starts with finding planets with liquid water on the surface. Planets (or moons) which meet this criteria live in the so-called 'Goldilocks Zone', where planets are just the right distance from their sun (""not too hot, not too cold"") for water to exist. But new computer models, presented at this week's British Science Festival, allow scientists to identify planets with underground water, which is kept liquid by planetary heat. The traditional view: Scientists look for surface water as a key indicator a planet is hospitable to life, like in this artist's impression - but underground water can also sustain life . These planets, they say, could be habitable. Sean McMahon, a PhD student from Aberdeen University, who worked on creating the model, said: 'It's the idea of a range of distances from a star within which the surface of an Earth-like planet is not too hot or too cold for water to be liquid. 'So traditionally people have said that if a planet is in this Goldilocks zone - not too hot and not too cold - then it can have liquid water on its surface and be a habitable planet' Prof John Parnell, also from Aberdeen University, said: 'There is a . significant habitat for microorganisms below the surface of the Earth, . extending down several kilometres. 'And some workers believe that the bulk of life on Earth could even reside in this deep biosphere.' Going underground: Recent research shows how much life exists within our own planet's interior . The BBC reports that the team are now developing models to predict which planets might harbour underground reservoirs of liquid water - in turn raising the possibility of alien life. Mr McMahon added: 'If you take into account the possibility of deep biospheres, then you have a problem reconciling that with the idea of a narrow habitable zone defined only by conditions at the surface.' The team said that even if a planet so far from its sun that that it received almost no solar heat, it could still maintain underground liquid water.","Aberdeen scientists develop models to predict which planets might have water trapped below the surface .

Archaeologists are hoping to find his grave under a council car park in Leicester. Archaeologists digging under a council car park in Leicester where they believe King Richard III may be buried have made their first breakthrough. A team from the University of Leicester has revealed that just days into the dig, they have found a wall that could form part of the friary where the last medieval king of England was buried. 'The remains are very possibly medieval walls but this is subject to confirmation today,' the team said. 'We will also seek to establish if these are part of the medieval Greyfriars site where Richard III was buried.' Richard Buckley of the University of Leicester, who is leading the dig, said: 'The search for Richard goes on - it is still a long shot, but the archaeological work we have done so far is revealing more about the archaeology of the Greyfriars area than we ever knew before. 'In that respect, whatever the outcome - whether we find Richard or not - this work is an advance in terms of helping us to tell the story of the city of Leicester. The dig is being filmed for a forthcoming Channel 4 documentary to be aired later this year. The team has so far dug a trench 30 metres long, removing the modern car park surface and hard core formation, and machining through 18th and 19th-century garden soils to get down to the top of the medieval layer - around 1.5 metres below present ground level. The researchers believe King Richard III was buried in a Franciscan friary in the area after being killed by the army of Henry Tudor during the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. The friary was, however, knocked down during Henry VIII’s dissolution of the monasteries, and the exact location of the burial site has been one of Britain’s enduring historical mysteries ever since.

Last week, . they began digging it up. Richard was King of England for two years, from 1483 until the Battle of Bosworth. His . death at the age of 32 marked the end of 30 years of civil war, known . as the Wars of the Roses, and the end of the middle ages. It also marked the dawn of the Tudor dynasty and the demise of the Plantagenets. His . clothes and armour were removed and his naked body carried on horseback . to Leicester, where the corpse was displayed in public for three days. He was then buried in the Franciscan friary, known as Greyfriars, but just over 50 years later the church was destroyed.

In a field behind Fenn Lane Farm near Leicester, the treeline marks the spot where Richard III is believed to have been killed in battle. The 69p stamp featuring Richard III . Born . in 1452, Richard III was King of England for two years, from 1483 . until his death in 1485 during the Battle of Bosworth Field. According to another tale, Richard consulted a seer in Leicester before the battle who foretold that 'where your spur should strike on the ride into battle, your head shall be broken on the return'. On the ride into battle his spur struck the bridge stone of the Bow Bridge; legend has it that, as his corpse was being carried from the battle over the back of a horse, his head struck the same stone and was broken open.Richard III was the last English king to be killed in battle . He was the last king of the House of York and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty. Although Richard III has gone down in history as a monstrous tyrant with a . hunchback and a withered arm, most historians now claim such an . image is purely fictitious and down largely to how he was portrayed by . Shakespeare. Legend says the body was removed and . cast into the river Soar, but historians hope to prove wrong this . disputed version of events by finding it at the council site. The archaeologists, from Leicester . University, along with members of the Richard III Historical Society, . hope finding the remains will help to change the way the monarch is . viewed historically. Richard III is traditionally seen as a tyrant who murdered his way to the throne, disfigured by a hunchback and a withered arm. Many historians, however, claim that a distorted image of the king was deliberately created by the Tudors, the most notorious example of which is Shakespeare’s play about him. The Richard III Historical Society said it hoped the excavation, which is projected to last two weeks, would end ‘the enormous disparagement’ of his reputation. The site of the friary was bought by Alderman Robert Herrick, the Mayor of Leicester, in 1612, after the church was demolished in 1538. He built a mansion there. In 1914, Leicestershire County Council bought the land, later turning it into a car park. Archaeologists will start by digging two long trenches across the car park, hoping to find remains of the church and narrow down the search. They will also use ground-penetrating radar to find the best places to dig. Richard Buckley, co-director of the Archaeology Service at the university, said: ‘It is quite a long shot but it’s a very exciting project. We don’t know precisely where the body would have been buried but we suspect it would be in the choir or near the altar.’ If bones are found they will be assessed for trauma to the skeleton. Richard was hacked down after being surrounded and one historical account suggests that the blow which finally felled him was so hard that fragments of his helmet were left in his skull. They will also be subjected to DNA analysis. The remains will be matched against the DNA of Joy Ibsen, a 16th generation descendant of Anne of York, the sister of Richard III. Mrs Ibsen died four years ago, aged 82. At the site yesterday, Mrs Ibsen’s son Michael, 55, watched as the search began. The furniture-maker, who was born in Canada but now lives in London, said his mother would have been thrilled by the project. ‘The family were entertained when she got the call several years ago from a historian claiming she was a descendant,’ he added. The Chiddingly Boar, medieval silver-gilt livery badge of Richard III, helped researchers pinpoint the location of the battle of Bosworth when is was found in east Sussex in 1999 . Archaeologist Dr Glenn Foard shows today how the badge of the boar led them to pinpoint the battlefield and where the king fell.

They have uncovered evidence of the lost garden of Robert Herrick - where, historically, it is recorded there was a memorial to Richard III. Now the ‘time tomb team’, as they have become to be known, has discovered paving stones which they believe belong to the garden. The University of Leicester is leading the archaeological search for the burial place of King Richard III with Leicester City Council, in association with the Richard III Society. In 1485 King Richard III was defeated at the battle of Bosworth. His body, stripped and despoiled, was brought to Leicester where he was buried in the church of the Franciscan Friary, known as the Grey Friars. Over time the exact whereabouts of the Grey Friars became lost. he project, which began two weeks ago, has involved digging of two trenches at a council park - and this week a third trench was excavated. Earlier this week, the archaeologists confirmed they had found the church of the Grey Friars and now they have found the garden outside the church.

In the early 1600s, Alderman Robert Herrick, a mayor of Leicester, bought the land of the Grey Friars and built a large mansion house with a garden on the site. In 1612, Christopher Wren, father of the famous architect, was visiting Herrick and recorded seeing a handsome three foot stone pillar in Herrick's garden. Inscribed on the pillar was: 'Here lies the body of Richard III sometime King of England'. This is the last known record of the . site of King Richard's grave. Richard is historically recorded as being . buried in the choir of the Church of Grey Friars. A lead window came (a section of leading that supports stained glass windows from the Grey Friars church . The earliest surviving portrait of Richard III in Leicester Cathedral. Archaeologists are hoping to find his grave under a council car park in Leicester. The 69p stamp featuring Richard III . Born . in 1452, Richard III was King of England for two years, from 1483 . until his death in 1485 during the Battle of Bosworth Field. According . to another tale, Richard consulted a seer in Leicester before the . battle who foretold that 'where your spur should strike on the ride into . battle, your head shall be broken on the return'. On . the ride into battle his spur struck the bridge stone of the Bow . Bridge; legend has it that, as his corpse was being carried from the . battle over the back of a horse, his head struck the same stone and was . broken open.Richard III was the last English king to be killed in battle . He was the last king of the House of York and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty. Although Richard III has gone down in history as a monstrous tyrant with a . hunchback and a withered arm, most historians now claim such an . image is purely fictitious and down largely to how he was portrayed by . Shakespeare. Thereafter, . in 1711, Herrick's descendants sold the mansion house and garden. After . passing through various owners the mansion house was eventually pulled . down sometime in the 1870s and the municipal buildings were built. However, Herrick's garden seems to have remained a garden, or wasteland, . up until the 1930s - 40s when it was tarmacked over to become a car . park. Mrs Langley added: “The discovery of Herrick's garden is a major step forward and I'm incredibly excited. 'In locating what looks like one of the garden's pathways and, potentially, its central area which could have once held the three foot stone pillar marking the location of King Richard's grave, we could be that bit closer to finding the resting place of Britain's last warrior king.” Mr Buckley, co-director of University of Leicester Archaeological Services, said the area of paving was found at its southern end, composed of re-used medieval tiles laid in a haphazard pattern. “The tiles were also extremely worn and of many different sizes. 'Although the date at which the paving was laid has yet to be confirmed, we suspect that it relates to the period of Herrick’s mansion. 'Interestingly, the 18th century map of Leicester shows a formal garden with a series of paths leading to a central point. “The paving we have found may relate to this garden, but it lies outside the church to the south. 'Inside the church in this third trench, further investigation has revealed some large fragments of window tracery which could well relate to the east window, behind the high altar. If so, this may show that we are in the extreme east end of the building –near the choir where Richard III is said to have been buried. “Having overcome the major hurdle of finding the church, I am now confident that we are within touching distance of finding the choir – a real turning point in the project and a stage which, at the outset, I never really thought we might reach.” Work at the site will stop for a public open day between 11- 2 on Saturday September 8 and will resume next week. The dig is being filmed by Darlow Smithson Productions for a forthcoming Channel 4 documentary to be aired later this year. A depiction of the carnage during the Battle of Bosworth Field by 18th century painter Philip James de Loutherbourg (1740-1812) The Battle of Bosworth Field was . fought on the morning of August 22, 1485, and marked the end of the War . Of The  Roses, the 30-year civil war between the houses of York and . Lancaster. One of the . most important clashes in English history, it saw the death of Richard . III, ushered in the Tudor dynasty and gave Shakespeare one of his best . known quotations. The leading role has been played by Laurence Olivier and Sir Ian McKellen, and the battle has also been immortalised in many artworks. The battle marked the final . confrontation between the Yorkist king Richard III and his challenger . Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond and leader of the House of Lancaster. The seeds of Richard's downfall were sown when he seized the throne from his 12-year-old nephew Edward V in 1483. Support . for the monarch was further diminished when Edward and his younger . brother disappeared and Richard was involved in the death of his wife. Henry laid claim to the throne from across the Channel. Following . an unsuccessful attempt to invade England from his base in France, . Henry arrived on the coast of Wales on August 1, 1485. Gathering . support as he marched inland, Richard hurriedly mustered troops and . intercepted Henry's army south of Market Bosworth in Leicestershire. After .

Ask almost any American adult about the Iran hostage crisis, and you'll get the outlines of the well-known story: militants storming the American embassy in Tehran in 1979 and holding dozens of Americans hostage for 444 days. Now, CIA disguise master Antonio Mendez has lifted the lid on a less well known story, one with just as much suspense - how, amid the chaos, six Americans escaped. For almost three months, the group hid out in Iran, sheltered by the Canadian government. But the situation grew increasingly precarious. Junior partner: Former CIA agent Antonio Mendez, pictured in 1999, is releasing a book, Agro, about his daring plot to rescue six hostages from Tehran in 1979 . Ultimately, the CIA sent two operatives into the country to rescue the group. As cover, the CIA concocted an elaborate back story involving a Hollywood film. Mendez developed a plan to disguise the Americans as a Hollywood group scouting locations for a fake science-fiction film called Argo. Mendez didn't do anything halfway. He obtained a script, advertised the film, printed business cards, and rented and staffed a Hollywood office in case anyone in Iran checked up on the story. Taken captive: Six Americans were held hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1970 by their militant Iranian captors . Life imitates art: Left, Mendez' upcoming account of the daring rescue which involved making up a sci-fi movie to film and right, the movie starring Ben Affleck as Mendez comes out later this year . Real deal: Mendez had this poster manufactured as part of the rescue . Then, posing as the film's producer, . he slipped into Tehran, helped transform the embassy workers into . Hollywood types and spirited the Americans on a plane to Switzerland. For years, however, the full story of the CIA's involvement was a secret. That changed in 1997, the 50th anniversary of the CIA. Mendez was honoured by the agency that year, and he related the Argo story for newsman Dan Rather. Now, in what is an ironic twist, the fake movie caper is becoming the plot of a real Hollywood film. It's set for release October 12, and Ben Affleck directs and stars as Mendez. Readers who want the un-Hollywood version will find that besides being a talented spy, Mendez is also a gifted storyteller. The Maryland resident has also written previously about his clandestine work in The Master of Disguise and Spy Dust. His latest book is a page turner despite the fact readers know from the beginning how the story will end.","CIA disguise master Antonio Mendez created vast sci-fi movie plot to free captives at U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979 .

'Low self-esteem': Rebecca Raymond was sacked from the boarding school she taught at after asking for maternity leave . A private girls’ school which sacked a pregnant art teacher to ‘avoid wasting money on maternity pay’ was yesterday ordered to pay her almost £34,000 in compensation. Rebecca Raven said she was made to feel like an ‘irresponsible teenager’ after telling the headmistress that she wanted to take maternity leave. When she complained, Robbie Locke, one of the trustees at Howell’s School in Denbigh, North Wales, told her: ‘Maternity leave is very disruptive to businesses and has made businesses go bust. ‘We already have a staff member who has worked only four weeks this year and has already been paid for a full year. This cannot happen again.’ An employment tribunal had previously ruled that Mrs Raven, 32, was unfairly sacked from her £23,295 post. At yesterday’s hearing, held to determine her payout, the mother-of-three broke down in tears as she revealed the impact her dismissal had had on her. She said it had affected her pregnancy and her self-image had been reduced from that of a grown-up woman to an ‘irresponsible teenager’. Employment Judge Donald Thompson said: ‘This is a serious case of failure. There was no appeal, you were dismissed in the middle of a meeting and you did not have representation.’ Earlier Mrs Raven had told the . hearing: ‘I was shocked and upset at my employment being terminated as I . thoroughly enjoyed my job, regularly going above and beyond the call of . duty to the benefit of the school. ‘I . was unable to eat properly for several months after that date as a . result of the stress which meant my pregnancy weight gain was very slow. ‘I . was left feeling irresponsible and with low self-esteem because I was . being put in a position where I was unable to care for my present . children as well as I should, let alone a new baby.’ When Mrs Raven complained, Robbie Locke, one of the trustees at Howell's School in Denbigh, North Wales, (pictured) told her: 'Maternity leave is very disruptive to businesses' Mrs Raven, of Flint, North Wales, was sacked from the boarding school, which charges fees of £21,000 a year, eight days after asking Emma Jones, the acting headmistress, for maternity leave. At a subsequent meeting with Mr Locke, she was told: ‘Because I would have to pay you maternity, other areas of the school will miss out. Money has been wasted in the past on sick pay and maternity pay.’ Mrs Raven told yesterday’s hearing: ‘The meeting with Mr Locke was an awful experience. 'He was verbally aggressive and his comments made me feel worthless. During that meeting I felt victimised because I had decided to extend my family. ‘I felt that my reputation as a committed and professional teacher had been damaged.’ According to the tribunal ruling, the school’s financial position was ‘extremely precarious’ at the time, with pupil numbers down a third, and Mr Locke – one of four trustees – was having to subsidise it from his own pocket to the tune of £25,000 a month. Mrs Raven’s compensation included a basic award of £800, £1,318 for loss of maternity pay, future loss of earnings of £14,355, loss of statutory rights of £250 and injury to feelings of £7,500.","Rebecca Raven was sacked from £21,000-a-year school in North Wales after asking for maternity leave .

A mischievous pet has become infamous throughout his neighbourhood as ‘Denis the Menace’ after stealing more than one hundred garments from his nearby homes and gardens. The real-life cat burglar has a weakness for pinching and has swiped all manner of items, which he takes home to his embarrassed owner Lesley Newman, aged 49. Over an 18 month crime spree Denis’s haul includes a bath towel, a thong, a football, five paintbrushes, a pair of slippers, an designer shirt, a doll and gloves. Scroll down to watch the CCTV . Cheeky cat Denis, now known as Denis the Menace to his neighbours, with his haul of stolen goods . He has taken men’s boxer shorts, a pair of shoes, a cardigan, a dog chew, dozens of pairs of socks, a chamois leather, tea towels, seven car sponges and a cuddly toy. Victims of the two-year-old black and white cat’s antics often turn up at Mrs Newman’s home in Luton, Bedfordshire, when their belongings go missing. The first theft was recorded just a week after he was let out of the house for the first time, with his stolen stash growing week on week until he began carrying home T-shirts in his mouth, often having to jump over garden fences along the way. His largest prize to date is a bath towel which he dragged through the streets and his most expensive is a Fred Perry polo short. On one occasion he retrieved a woman’s sandal from a garden in a neighbouring road - and returned a week later to pinch the other one. Many of the items have fallen off washing lines as they often have clothes pegs still attached. CCTV footage captures Denis carrying a bike helmet bag in his mouth on to the family's driveway . On another occasion he is caught on camera with a hand towel between his teeth . Denis also works at night, pictured in the dark pushing his loot through the cat flap and taking it up to Mrs Newman in bed . Mrs Newman, an accounts assistant, has built up two large boxes filled with Denis’s loot which she keeps in case anyone arrives to claim ownership of them. She said: ‘Denis is a rescue cat and we have had him since he was six-weeks-old. ‘After he had been neutered I let him and my other cat, Eddie, out for the first time when they were six-months-old. ‘It . was just a week after that when Denis brought his first things home. It . started off as a sock and some paper, but gradually escalated. ‘It wasn’t just lighter items like a pair of pants, there were heavier things such as a Barbie doll in and a bath towel. 'He has completely filled two large boxes. 'I tracked down the lady who lost her sandals and Denis would have had to scale five 6ft fences to get there and back. Lesley Newman said the naughty pet often brings other people's belongings to her in bed believing they are prey . Denis's crime spree started just a week after he was allowed out of the house for the first time, regularly carrying home items like pants and t-shirts in his mouth . Embarrassed Mrs Newman shows off the two boxes full of clothing and toys that two-year-old Denis has pinched over the last 18 months . ‘I would say he has taken well over . 100 things now, so I have started collecting them up and if people are . looking for something, I tell them to knock on my door. ‘I have never tried to stop his behaviour, I would much rather him bring objects into the house than dead animals. Thieving cat Denis has been affectionately called 'Denis the Menace' by neighbours after the troublesome cartoon character, pictured . ‘He normally leaves them outside the front door but some of the time he will bring them up to me bed while I am asleep. ‘He obviously thinks all these items are prey.’ Vicky Halls, a cat behaviourist, said: ‘There are so many different theories on why cats steal, but I think it’s a basic hunting instinct. ‘I have seen many cats steal all sorts of things and bring them in through the cat flap and carry items as if they were prey. ‘It’s relatively common in cats for them to do this, and it could be the process of finding an object, grabbing it, and taking it back that they like, not actually the item itself. ‘Or, it could be the texture and feel of certain items in their mouths that they like, which could be why certain things are taken time and time again. ‘All of these things can easily make them develop a habit, and Denis has become a bit of a huntaholic.’","Denis pinches everything from towels to toys from his neighbours and carries or drags them home through his cat flap .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:40 EST, 20 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:36 EST, 20 September 2012 . Police believe a Naval Postgraduate School professor shot her ex-wife multiple times at his home before dismembering her body and dumping some of the remains in a remote area of Aromas, California. Norife 'Janie' Herrera Jones, 29, was discovered murdered September 7 on Cannon Road in the suburban town. Lawrence Jones, 69, was arrested a week later in connection to his ex-wife's slaying, police said. In a statement released on Wednesday, investigators said Herrera Jones died from multiple gunshot wounds before her lifeless body was mutilated. Tragic end: Norife 'Janie' Herrera Jones, 29, left, was discovered brutally murdered last week, and police suspect that her ex-husband, 69-year-old Lawrence Jones, right, is responsible for the slaying . Herrera Jones was killed a week after the couple's divorce became finalized, putting an end to a tempestuous five-year marriage. Friends and neighbors say that the young woman separated from her husband earlier in the year because of his angry outbursts. The 69-year-old was taken into custody following a search of his Spray Avenue home in Monterey, during which police said they had found enough evidence to charge him with his ex-wife’s murder. Jones did not enter a plea at his court appearance on Wednesday.  He was initially scheduled to appear before a judge the day before, but an undisclosed medical problem resulted in a delay. On Wednesday, Jones was seen in court sporting a bandage on his right wrist, which suggests that he may have tried to take his own life, considering his history of suicide attempts. Tragic find: Herrera Jones' remains were discovered September 7 along Cannon Road in Aromas . Lawrence Jones, known to friends as Larry, has been a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School for 25 years, most recently serving as financial management chair, The Monterey county Herald reported. He worked as a visiting consultant for the Asian Development Bank, as a visiting scholar at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand and the University of Siena in Italy. He taught at NPS and has lived in Monterey since the late 1980s. Janie Herrera Jones was described by those who knew her a sweet and trusting young woman. According to her online resume, the 29-year-old was a highly educated and accomplished businesswoman in her native Philippines, with a strong interest in international affairs and a master’s degree in business management. However, when Herrera Jones arrived in the U.S., she was forced to seek more humble positions, including a job at a Macy’s department store and a stint at Lens Crafters. She also volunteered her time working for charitable organizations, including the American Cancer Society and Special Kids Crusade in Monterey, where she organized more than 1,200 books for the library. Volatile marriage: Herrera, left, tied the knot with Jones, right, in 2006, but the relationship started going south due to the husband's alleged outbursts, leading the 29-year-old woman to leave him last year . Long career: Jones spent the last 25 years teaching at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), an accredited research university operated by the United States Navy . It is believed that Herrera Jones married the distinguished professor 40 years her senior in February of 2006. Friends and former neighbors said the marriage appeared happy at first and that Janie Jones told them she loved her husband the first couple of years. But then the relationship apparently started turning sour between the two, and last year, the young woman left. Janie Jones told friends that her husband, a Stanford University graduate, became upset after his alma mater’s football team lost a game, and things escalated from there. The outburst was the last straw for Janie Jones, said friends. Co-workers gave her clothes and helped her move to San Jose, where she got an apartment, found work and started her new single life. Gruesome scene: Police searched Jones' home on Spray Avenue in Monterey (pictured) and arrested him after discovering evidence of a crime . Her volatile ex-husband, however, was apparently not ready to move on. As the divorce came close to being finalized, police said he slashed his wrists and begged his estranged wife to come back. Suicide concerns: Jones appeared in court on Wednesday with a bandage around his right wrist, suggesting that he may have attempted to take his life . According to former neighbor Sat Kirtan Khalsa, the apparent suicide attempt was a reprisal of an incident that took pace years earlier. During a previous marriage, Jones slit his wrists and was rushed to the hospital in the middle of the night. Janie Jones’ friends said she felt sorry for her ex-husband and was heartbroken over the divorce, but was determined to start a new life. She planned to visit relatives in Asia this month, and after family members had not heard from her for days, friends filed missing persons reports. Police are trying to determine what led Janie Jones to travel to her ex-husband’s home just days before her murder. According to friends, the 29-year-old said last month she had to visit Lawrence Jones to sign final papers for her divorce. However, Michael Mendenhall, a legal assistance who prepared the couple’s documents, tld the Herald that there was nothing left to sign. Although . people close to the couple described a troubled and abusive marriage, . Mendenhall said the couple appeared polite and cordial during a meeting . this past February. ‘He was what could best be described as a . perfect gentleman. He wanted to be sure that she was taken care of . financially, so he explained to her what he was going to do for her . financially,’ Mendenhall told the paper. According to court records, the couple separated November 16, 2011. In February, Lawrence Jones filed for divorce. He signed final papers on June 18, Mendenhall said, and the papers were filed with the court on June 20. The final decree was issued August 31. A week later, the 29-year-old woman was found killed and dismembered. Police are investigating how she ended up in the Spray Avenue house, and how long she was there before her death. Investigators say they are looking into friends' suspicions that she was kidnapped before her murder.","Lawrence Jones spent 25 years teaching at Naval Postgraduate School .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:31 EST, 24 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:07 EST, 25 September 2012 . A European court has ruled that radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri can be extradited to the United States to face terrorism charges, including allegedly trying to set up an al-Qaida training camp in rural Oregon. The decision ends a long-running legal battle and means that al-Masri, considered one of Britain's most notorious extremists, could be deported to the U.S. within weeks along with four other terrorism suspects. Authorities in the U.S. have for years asked for Al-Masri and the others to be handed over, but the process had been delayed because the men raised human rights objections. Kicked out: The ruling brings an end to a legal saga over Abu Hamza which has lasted eight years and cost more than $1.5million . The men had argued before the European Court of Human Rights that they could face prison conditions and jail terms in the U.S. that would expose them to ‘torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’ in breach of the European human rights code. In April, the Strasbourg, France-based court rejected those claims. Al-Masri and the four others lodged an appeal to the court's highest judges, but on Monday the court said it refused to hear it. That ruling brings an end to a legal saga which has lasted eight years and cost the British taxpayer more than $1.6million (£1million). ‘Today the Grand Chamber Panel decided to reject the request,’ the court said in a brief statement. It did not give a reason for refusing the appeal. Britain's Home Office and the U.S. Department of Justice welcomed the decision. ‘We will work to ensure that the individuals are handed over to the U.S. authorities as quickly as possible,’ said the Home Office. Worshippers: Hamza (pictured centre, wearing blue) earned global notoriety for his vile sermons outside the Finsbury Park Mosque in London . In Washington, Dean Boyd, spokesman for the National Security Division of the U.S. justice department, said: ‘We are pleased that the litigation before the European Court of Human Rights in these cases has come to an end, and we will be working with the U.K. authorities on the arrangements to bring these subjects to the United States for prosecution.’ The suspects, who are accused of crimes such as raising funds for terrorists, could face life sentences in a maximum-security prison. One of the world’s most dangerous preachers of hate, Al-Masri  was arrested in Britain in 2004 at the request of U.S. authorities, who have called him ‘a terrorist facilitator with a global reach.’ They accuse him of assisting the taking of 16 hostages - including two American tourists - in Yemen in 1998 and of conspiring to set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon, between 2000 and 2001. U.S. authorities have called Hamza ¿a terrorist facilitator with a global reach¿ . He also is accused of conspiring with a U.S. citizen to facilitate a jihad - or holy war - in Afghanistan and providing material support to al-Qaida and the Taliban. The cleric, who is blind in one eye and wears a hook for a hand, lost several British court cases in his fight against extradition before taking the case to the European court in 2008. Known for his fiery anti-Western and anti-Semitic outbursts, he claims he has lost his Egyptian nationality, but Britain considers him an Egyptian citizen. He is currently serving a seven-year prison term in Britain for separate charges of inciting hatred. The other four suspects due to be extradited to the U.S. are Babar Ahmad, Syed Tahla Ahsan, Khaled al-Fawwaz and Adel Abdul Bary. Ahmad and Ahsan are charged in U.S. federal court in Connecticut with running a terrorist website in London, providing material support to terrorists, conspiring to kill U.S. nationals, and money laundering. Supporters of Ahmad, who was arrested in 2004 and has been held in a British jail since then without charge, are trying to help him get a trial in Britain because his alleged offense happened in London. Radical muslim clerk Sheikh Abu Hamza allegedly lost an eye and had both hands blown off by a mine in Afghanistan . Al-Fawwaz and Bary, accused of being key aides to Osama bin Laden in London, are wanted in a New York federal court for the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people. Al-Fawwaz faces many counts of murder. The human rights court said that it has not decided on the case of a sixth suspect, Haroon Rashid Aswat, who was accused of being Al-Masri's co-conspirator in attempting to set up the camp in Oregon. The court said it needed to consider more information about his case. Hamza was first arrested at the request of the U.S. in May 2004 but the extradition was halted when the UK decided to charge him on allegations relating to his sermons. In 2006, he was jailed for seven years for preaching hate and inciting murder at Finsbury Park Mosque. The extradition proceedings resumed once Hamza became eligible for release. He arrived in Britain more than 30 years ago and has seven children from a second marriage. In the late 1980s, he headed to Afghanistan but returned a few years later having lost an eye and both hands – allegedly blown off by a mine.","Accusations against the radical Muslim cleric include trying to set-up an al-Qaida training camp in Oregon .

Lance Bombardier Ben is the most seriously injured soldier to survive the conflict in Afghanistan, where he lost both legs, broke his back and suffered brain damage in a blast from an exploding Taliban mine in 2006. Against all the odds, the 27-year-old survived, and he is now determined to confound expectations once again by walking unaided on his state-of-the-art £60,000 artificial legs. Hero: Ben Parkinson - the most severely wounded soldier to have survived the Afghan conflict - wearing his computer-assisted prosthetic legs . The computer-assisted legs were created for Mr Parkinson, from Doncaster, by Rehab Prosthetics in Coalville, Loughborough - the same firm that enabled Paralympic gold medallist Johnny Peacock to race to glory in the 2012 Games. Each of the legs - paid for by the Ministry of Defence - contains a micro processor which senses movement and responds by bending the 'knee', allowing Ben to walk. Under the guidance of physiotherapist and former Naval officer Robert 'Shep' Shepherd determined Mr Parkinson is making huge progress, and has pledged to walk on his new legs without assistance. 'You don't say ""no"" to Ben, you don't say ""can't"",' Mr Shepherd said. 'I struggle to keep up, I no longer make a plan of what to do in the day because he moves so quickly. 'The legs now are just wonderful,' he added. Mr Parkinson said: 'I don't believe I'll walk again, I know I'll walk again.' Defying the odds: Ben Parkinson walking on his new prosthetic legs . Building confidence: The 27-year-old is having intense physiotherapy to help him grow accustomed to wearing the false legs . Inspiration: Lance Bombardier Ben carried the Olympic Torch in his hometown of Doncaster during the relay leading up to the Games . The soldier spent three months unconscious in a military hospital after sustaining horrific injuries when a mine exploded under his Land Rover in Afghanistan in 2006. He had to learn to speak again and has been left with co-ordination problems similar to those associated with stroke sufferers. In June, crowds of people cheered Ben on as he battled for 27 painful and exhausting minutes to carry the Olympic Torch through his hometown of Doncaster in the lead-up to the Games.

Foglietta agreed to pay $200.00 for child sex . and followed us back to a Philadelphia hotel, myself [sic] ad another . child prostitute then engaged coach Phil in child sex.' Cover up: Poly Prep school has been accused of hiding football coach Phil Foglietta's sexual abuse in a scandal that mirrors the sordid goings-on by Sandusky at Penn State . A sexual abuse lawsuit was filed in 2009 by ten former students and two day campers at Poly Prep. At a hearing last Friday, a district court judge urged plaintiffs and the school's lawyers to reach a settlement but so far no deal has been struck. Poly prep school was accused of covering up the former football coach's sexual abuse of young boys in a case that shockingly mirrors the Penn State scandal. A lawyer representing the 12 victims argued that the abuse could have been prevented had the school not buried the football coach’s abuse in a bid to protect its reputation and athletic program. Monster: Former Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky, convicted of 45 counts of child sex abuse, is facing life in prison when sentenced . Kevin Mulhearn claims that the . school’s cover-up prevented Foglietta’s victims from taking legal action . against the school in time, before the statute of limitations expired. Mulhearn, who is also a former student, has also accused Poly Prep of withholding documents and providing misleading testimony. The cover-up reportedly began in 1966 when one alleged victim named William Jackson told J. Folwell Scull, who was headmaster at the time, that he had been abused by Foglietta. The . school reportedly conducted a bogus investigation and the former . student was threatened with expulsion if he continued to voice his . allegations. A few . years later, another football player named John Marino told officials . that he had seen Foglietta abusing boys on ten different occasions but . he was branded a troublemaker. The . cover-up continued for another 25 years until David Hiltbrand, a . Philadelphia-based journalist and former student, told of the abuse he . had suffered at the hands of the coach and wrote about the scandal. He was contacted by Mulhearn, who filed the civil suit which seeks damages of $20 million for each of the plaintiffs, in 2009.  Mulhearn is accusing the school of fraud, a charge Poly Prep argues is irrelevant because the plaintiffs did not sue in time. During a hearing in June this year, U.S. Magistrate Judge Cheryl Pollak ruled that there was evidence that Poly Prep tried to mislead the plaintiffs and the court. 'The law provides that Poly Prep has an in loco parentis supervisory standard over kids. That means the school is acting in place of a parent in the care and protection of a child,' Mulhearn said. 'A responsible parent would not have swept this under the rug.’ The scandal mirrors the accusations leveled at staff at Penn State. Scandal: Poly Prep in Brooklyn, New York has been accused of covering up sexual abuse allegations stretching back decades . The university's internal investigation released a final report in July describing how the University's top officials 'repeatedly concealed critical facts' about former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky's sexual abuse of young boys for more than a decade. The report told of how the four administrators knew about an assault that took place in 1998 but showed 'callous disregard' for victims by covering it up and keeping the situation quiet so as to avoid bad publicity. Shocking testimony from a war veteran janitor showed the 'culture of reverence' for football that blinded anyone from reporting the wrongdoing in fear that 'they'd get rid of us all'. 'The most powerful men at Penn State failed to take any steps for 14 years to protect the children who Sandusky victimized,’ the Freeh report states. In the years following the initial sex assault, seven more boys were victimized which could have been prevented if the men had reported Sandusky to the police immediately.","Phil Foglietta, deceased, accused of raping and assaulting students at Poly Prep school in Brooklyn, New York for 20 years .

James Bond actor Sir Sean Connery warned an author not to take LSD because he had experienced a bad trip when he tried the hallucinogenic drug himself, it was claimed today. Irish writer Edna O'Brien said that the former 007 star advised her against trying the drug. She claimed that the Scottish actor told her how his trip with psychiatrist RD Laing had a 'freight of terrors'. Advice: Sir Sean Connery (left) warned Edna O'Brien (right) not to take LSD because he had experienced a bad trip when he tried the hallucogenic drug himself, the Irish novelist has claimed . Sir Sean has never spoken publicly about his involvement with Laing, who became an icon of the 1960s counter-culture movement after he argued that LSD had therapeutic benefits. However, the actor's first wife, Diane Cilento, has previously alleged that Laing persuaded him to take the powerful drug to help him deal with stress after he appeared as Bond in 1964 movie Goldfinger. Taking LSD was legal at the time. Possession of the drug was only outlawed in Britain in 1966. O'Brien refers to the episode in her new memoir, Country Girl, according to the Sunday Times. She describes a conversation she had with the Bond actor in May 1970 when she was planning to meet Laing and take the drug herself. Claims: Sir Sean Connery, starring in the Bond film Goldfinger in 1964. His first wife alleged that he took LSD to help deal with stress after the movie was released . Maverick: Scottish psychiatrist RD Laing, who died in 1989, is said to have given Sir Sean Connery LSD . 'I . had learnt from Sean Connery, with whom I had dinner the previous . evening, that his own LSD trip with Laing — both being old friends from . Scotland — had its own freight of terrors,' O'Brien writes. 'Yet I did not cancel the appointment. It was as if in some way I believed I could go through with it and yet escape the terrible ordeal.' O'Brien, who came to prominence following the release of her 1960 novel The Country Girls, writes that, after taking LSD, she had 'hideous' hallucinations which included Laing being transformed into a rat and her kitchen walls into flesh. She claims that, as she neared the end of her psychedelic experience, Sir Sean came to see how she was faring. Cilento alleged in her own memoir, My Nine Lives, that Laing, who died in 1989, gave the Bond actor a tab of pure LSD. 'No one was privy to what happened over the next six hours, but I believe that, with his enormous reserve and armouring, Sean resisted the drug,' she wrote. 'As a result, he had to go to bed for several days to recover.' Sir Sean's agent and publicist is yet to respond to Mail Online's request for comment.

Crammed into small boxes, their heads wedged through tiny holes, the monkeys undoubtedly look terrified. Around them, men in rubber overalls and gas masks arrange a semi-circle of boxes containing guinea pigs on the deck of a sloping pontoon. After the boxes have been laid out, the men disappear below the deck of a ship, and for a while, nothing happens. Scroll down for video . Gruesome: A still from the 1952 film shows a monkey in distress as it is exposed to bubonic plague during the germ warfare tests of the Isle of Lewis . Then, after several minutes, a small bomb placed on a boom a few feet out to sea detonates, and showers the animals in a deadly cloud of bubonic plague. These scenes, which have just been released, appear in a gruesome film showing secret germ warfare experiments on animals carried out by British government scientists sixty years ago. The experiments, which ran from May to September 1952 off the coast of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, exposed nearly 3,500 guinea pigs and 83 Rhesus Macaque monkeys to deadly germs such as bubonic plague. Codenamed Operation Cauldron, the secret experiments were part of our nascent biological warfare programme, which at the time was deemed as important as the development of nuclear weapons. Acting in the belief that the Soviets . were producing bacteriological bombs, scientists from Porton Down . laboratory in Wiltshire were briefed to devise similar weapons that . could be used in retaliation against a Russian germ warfare strike. Although . the existence of the 47-minute film has been known about for many . years, it is now available for the world to see on the video-sharing . website YouTube, thanks to the efforts of Mike Kenner, 58, an Open . Government campaigner from Weymouth in Dorset. Trials: A Rhesus Macaque monkey and five guinea pigs await their fates on the deck of the pontoon . Scientists set out the animals in cages on the deck of the pontoon before a small bomb containing bacteriological agents is detonated . ‘This is the only film like it in the world,’ says Mr Kenner, who lobbied the Ministry of Defence to get the film released. ‘As far as I know, it’s the only film that shows animals being exposed to deadly pathogens.’ The MoD was reluctant to release the film, and it is not hard to see why as it is disturbing viewing. Many of the monkeys and guinea pigs exposed to the germs died within a few days, while any that survived were killed and dissected so their organs could be studied for the effects of the deadly germs. Above all, it is the sight of the monkeys’ almost human faces that make the film so shocking.‘Although we see the tests are being carried out on animals,’ says Mr Kenner, ‘when one sees the monkeys, one can’t help but empathise, and realise that these weapons were being designed to be used against people’. Very few of those who took part in Operation Cauldron are still alive. One of the men who can testify to the truth of what happened is Geoffrey Scarlett, 82, who was a petty officer on board the ship the Ben Lomond, which housed the animals and scientists. As the ship’s writer, responsible for sending back reports to the Admiralty, Mr Scarlett well understood the aims of the project. Many of the other sailors only had a vague idea of the experiments being carried out on the nearby pontoon. The terrified monkey are sealed in small boxes in the hold of the pontoon before being brought up on deck in batches to exposed to deadly germs . Fate: Many of the monkeys and guinea pigs exposed to the germs died within a few days, while any that survived were killed and dissected so their organs could be studied . ‘We were simply told that we were . going on a germ warfare trial,’ says Mr Scarlett. ‘But we were not told . where we were going.’ However, the men were informed that taking part . was not compulsory. ‘Right . from the beginning, they let anybody know that if they objected to the . experiments being carried out on animals, then they would be allowed to . drop out and there would be no stain on your record,’ says Mr Scarlett. ‘To . my knowledge, nobody dropped out. You have to remember these were . different times  and animal welfare was not such  a priority.’ Mr Scarlett also says most saw the necessity for the development of a new type of weapon of mass destruction. ‘It . was the middle of the Cold War,’ he says. ‘You realised that it had to . be done. Most had served in the war, or, like me, had been brought up . during the war. We had seen the atomic bomb, and this was another type . of warfare. ‘In . theory, it was going to be a lot more deadly than nuclear warfare. A . nuclear bomb can take out a city. Germ warfare can take out a country.’ The . utmost care was taken to keep the experiments safe and wind conditions . were carefully monitored before each detonation to avoid spreading the . germs inland. A scientist prepares for an experiment. Around 3,500 guinea pigs and 83 Rhesus Macaque monkeys were exposed to deadly germs . However, there was one accident that could have had disastrous consequences.On the last day of the programme, a trawler, the Carella, sailed through the path of a bubonic plague experiment. ‘The trawler was tailed by two naval vessels for 21 days, waiting for any distress call,’ says bacteriological warfare expert Dr Brian Balmer of University College, London. ‘When none came, almost all records of the incident were burnt.’ Indeed, the crew members only heard about their exposure to the plague when the official records were opened 50 years later. When the scientists involved in the trials returned to Porton Down, they judged the experiments to have been a success. ‘New ground has been broken with plague trials,’ read a report. But the findings of Operation Cauldron were never meant to come to the public’s attention. If the experiments ever did come to light, the then prime minister, Winston Churchill, had prepared a statement justifying what many would have regarded as unethical. ‘The possibility that bacteria may be used in a future war cannot be overlooked,’ the statement read. ‘The researches ... are being pursued so that defensive measures may be taken. The experiments now taking place form part of these researches.’ Today the MoD has sought to distance itself from the experiments. It says it does not recognise the treatment of animals as seen in the film as being in line with modern ethical scientific conduct. Although it is unlikely such creatures are today being exposed to deadly pathogens in the pursuit of military advantage, the release of the film is a chilling reminder of the disquieting lengths Britain went to develop perhaps the most deadly weapons the world had ever seen.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

Parents at Megan Stammers’ school demanded an inquiry into its child protection procedures last night as more under-age sex scandals emerged at the Church of England comprehensive. Incredibly, another teacher at Bishop Bell C of E School in Eastbourne was jailed three years ago for preying on teenage girls after grooming them on a social networking site. In addition, a former chairman of governors at the same school is due to stand trial on alleged child sex offences next month. Some parents said their children were too scared to attend class after it was revealed how staff failed to remove married maths teacher Jeremy Forrest despite warnings that he was having a relationship with Megan seven months ago. Richard Chapman, who has two children at the school, said: ‘Something needs to be done now, otherwise, where will it stop? And who will be next? The school has let everyone down and it is not like this is the first time it has happened. The school needs to be investigated from the very top levels of management. Something is not right there.’ The 47-year-old self-employed gardener added that his 11-year-old daughter, Charna Rose, had been too frightened to go to school this week. ‘She just doesn’t feel safe there now.’ Robert Healy, a supply teacher at the school, was jailed in 2009 for sleeping with two girls aged 15 and 16 after grooming them on a social networking site.

He admitted having sex three times with the younger girl between October and December 2007 and seven times with the older girl between February and April 2008. The devastated mother of the younger girl said after he was sentenced for seven years for ‘grave breach of trust’ at Lewes Crown Court: ‘You send your daughter to learn in school. You expect the teachers to protect them, not abuse them.’ Hunt: Teacher Jeremy Forrest and Megan were last seen on CCTV getting on a ferry to France . Another female pupil’s mother told her local newspaper after the case that she was removing her then 12-year-old daughter from the school because she felt its leadership team had failed to protect students from the predatory teacher.

Canon . Gordon Rideout, 73, stayed in his post despite the Church suspending . him in 2010 following a Criminal Records Bureau check. He . finally left his position at the school this year and was later charged . with 38 sexual offences against 18 children and young teenagers. They allegedly happened between 1962 and 1973, before he was involved at Bishop Bell. He is expected to stand trial next month. Yesterday there was more anger after the full extent of Megan’s relationship with Forrest emerged. Another . parent with children at the school, 33-year-old Susan Teixeira, said: . ‘This is an appalling breach of trust on the school’s part. They should . have told the parents.

The teacher in question should have been suspended. ‘Children shouldn’t be afraid to go to school. It’s just not right and something needs to be done.’ The school was accused of going to ‘extraordinary lengths’ to avoid revealing its child protection policy, which most schools put on their websites as a matter of course.

Held: Former News of the World legal manager Tom Crone who was arrested at his London home this morning . The News of the World's former legal adviser Tom Crone has been arrested over alleged phone hacking. The 60-year-old was held at his home in south west London this morning on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications and is being questioned at a south London police station. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The 60-year-old man was arrested at his . home address at approximately 6.45am,' but refused to comment on whether or not the suspect was a journalist. Mr Crone is the 25th person to be arrested under Operation Weeting, the Met Police’s investigation into allegations of phone hacking. The long-standing legal advisor, who left News International last July, had maintained that phone hacking at the NOTW was believed to have gone no further than a single 'rogue reporter' during a 2009 meeting with the culture, media and sport select committee. But when Rupert Murdoch appeared before the Leveson Inquiry into press standards earlier this year, he appeared to suggest Mr Crone was behind a cover-up at the company. Mr Murdoch claimed a 'clever lawyer and drinking pal of the journalists' had stopped employees from talking about the alleged hacking and had kept the truth from senior executives. Mr Crone later hit back at the comments, issuing a statement that said: 'Since Rupert Murdoch’s evidence today about a lawyer who had been on the News of the World . for many years can only refer to me, I am issuing the following . statement. 'His assertion that I “took charge of a cover-up” in relation to . phone-hacking is a shameful lie. The same applies to his assertions that . I misinformed senior executives about what was going on and that I . forbade people from reporting to Rebekah Brooks or to James Murdoch. Cover-up: When Rupert Murdoch appeared before the Leveson Inquiry into press standards earlier this year, he appeared suggest Mr Crone had been involved in a cover-up at the company . 'It is perhaps no coincidence that the two people he has identified . in relation to his cover-up allegations are the same two people who . pointed out that his son’s evidence to the Parliamentary Select . Committee last year was inaccurate. 'The fact that Mr Murdoch’s attack on Colin Myler and myself may have . been personal as well as being wholly wrong greatly demeans him.' Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Monday over charges linked to Operation Weeting. Charges: Former NI chief executive Rebekah Brooks, left, is due to appear in court on Monday over charges linked to Operation Weeting, while David Cameron’s former spin doctor Andy Coulson, right, appeared in court earlier this month . She is accused of one general charge of conspiracy to illegally access voicemails, and two others relating to murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler and former union boss Andrew Gilchrist. Seven other people including David Cameron’s former spin doctor Andy Coulson appeared at the same court earlier this month to face phone hacking charges. The group included six members of staff from the now-defunct tabloid the News of the World (NOTW), who all face the general charge alongside Brooks, as well as specific counts linked to individual people.

Craig Schum, 33, from Brooklyn, jumped out of his Jeep after seeing the light aircraft come down after taking off from East Hampton Airport in Long Island. Mr Schum, who has been working at a bakery in Wainscott, Long Island, saw the pilot staggering around close to the wreckage but then noticed a woman was still inside. Rescue: The barefoot hero dragged a female passenger from the wreckage of a Mooney light aircraft after it crashed in thick woodland in Long Island (file picture) Without a thought for his own safety he raced over, grabbed the woman and pulled her to safety moments before the plane burst into flames. Emergency crews arrived moments later. The single engine Mooney plane had crashed in thick woodland, about a half mile northeast of the airport after developing engine trouble. East Hampton police said the pilot and passenger had flown into the area earlier that day and were returning to Taunton, Massachusetts. Pilot Steven Bochter, who owns an auto . dealership in Massachusetts, was attempting to return at the airport . after the engine began to sputter. Witness Bill Kirrane said: 'They took a pretty hard hit, I know that. There was a lot of noise when it hit,' he said.

Police arrived at the scene moments after the man dragged the woman from the wreckage of the light aircraft . Describing Mr Schum's heoic rescue he added: 'He was covered in blood, and at first we thought it was his, but it was the passengers. 'That guy was a real hero. 'I went up to him after it all happened, with him covered in blood, and told him that it’s not every day that I meet someone who is willing to do something like he did. 'He did something special. It was unbelievable.' The pilot and the woman were airlifted to Stony Brook University Hospital. The pilot and the female passenger were taken to Stony Brook University Hospital suffering from minor injuries . The pilot's son, who did not want to be named, said they had suffered minor injuries but would be fine. Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Arlene Salac said the agency is investigating, along with the National Transportation Safety Board. The small airport is located about 100 miles east of New York City, in a bucolic but swank area frequented by celebrities and the wealthy. According to the airport's website, it serves a mix of private pilots, charter flights and commercial businesses. About 16,000 aircraft use the airport it annually, mostly between the months of May to October. The airport was temporarily closed during the investigation, halting normally busy Sunday traffic off the island. It was the second small plane crash on Long Island in a week.

The Clock Tower, which houses Big Ben, has been renamed the Elizabeth Tower in honour of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee . The historic clock tower that houses Big Ben was yesterday renamed the ‘Elizabeth Tower’ in honour of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. Commons Speaker John Bercow presided over a formal ceremony after the majority of MPs backed a Daily Mail campaign for the name change. The move, which is understood to have delighted the Queen, means one of Britain’s best-known landmarks will forever carry her name. It mirrors a tribute bestowed on Queen Victoria, the only other monarch to remain on the throne for 60 years. The tower at the other end of the Palace of Westminster was renamed the Victoria Tower to mark her long reign. The tower is known across the world by the name of the bell it houses - Big Ben - and MPs accept it will continue to be referred to by that name by most. Previously, the tower was officially known as the Clock Tower, . In the official naming ceremony at the foot of the tower, Mr Bercow said it was a ‘special and heart-warming’ occasion. ‘Everyone here present will speedily recall that Her Majesty the Queen has visited Parliament on no fewer than three occasions in this, a very special year, and it is a mark and symbol of the enormous affection and esteem in which Her Majesty is held by people of all political persuasions and none that this renaming has taken place.’ British landmark: The Palace of Westminster Clock Tower, right, has been renamed in honour of the Queen . Tory MP Tobias Ellwood, who tabled a Commons motion collecting names of MPs supporting the measure, including David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg, said: ‘Only two monarchs since William the Conqueror have actually served this country so diligently and selflessly for 60 years - that’s quite an incredible task considering the number of monarchs this country has seen - Queen Victoria and now Queen Elizabeth II. ‘She has served this country in such esteem - that was recognised this year with the celebrations that were seen. ‘She is one of the most respected public figures in the world. She reminds us who we are, what we are about and what it is to be British and it is a very proud day indeed to see this clock tower renamed in recognition of the work she has done.’",MPs backed a Daily Mail campaign for name change .

'Dark past': The murdered 58-year-old has been accused of sexually assaulting his pupils while teaching in Florida . The retired teacher whose brutal murder rocked a picture-perfect town designed by Disney has been accused of having a history of sexually abusing his male pupils. The violent murder of life-long Disney fan Matteo Patrick Giovanditto, who was found bludgeoned to death at his home in Celebration, Florida, U.S., in 2010, was the first in the history of the nostalgic homage to small-town America built south of Disney World. David-Israel Zenon Murillo, the homeless man who is set to face trial for the murder of the 58-year-old, told police he flew into a rage after Mr Giovanditto tried to sexually assault him. Now a number of former pupils have claimed the 'charismatic' teacher know as Mr G - who was said to be known for rewarding his pupils' achievements in the classroom with weekend trips to Disney World and sleepovers at his house - molested them during the 1980s. An anonymous mother told The Daily Beast that Giovanditto - who she has described as a 'cunning paedophile predator' - developed a close relationship with her 10-year-old son when she enrolled him in a summer camp at the Crossroads Academy in Florida, while Giovanditto was head teacher. The single mother said the teacher appeared to take her son under his wing - even treating him to trips abroad to countries including Mexico, Japan and China - until the boy suddenly cut all ties with Giovanditto at the age of 14. She claims she later learned her son's 'mentor' had been sexually abusing him for years. Accused: David-Israel Zenon Murillo claims Giovanditto gave him a beer laced with drugs then tried to have sex with him . A former pupil at Lehrman Day School, a private Jewish school where Giovanditto began teaching after relocating to Florida from Arizona in 1981, also told the news website he had had 'sexual contact' with his teacher during the mid-1980s. Describing himself as a 'pretty quiet kid', the former student said the teacher had taken an interest in him and 'pushed him to excel', and that the pair quickly began spending time together outside of school hours. Named only as 'D', the man said the sexual contact between himself and his teacher stopped only when his mother suddenly banned him from seeing Giovanditto outside of the classroom. He claimed it was only with hindsight he realised what had taken place amounted to abuse. He said: 'It had not really occurred to me. But thinking about it with perspective it was like, God, that was wrong.' Giovanditto, who was raised in Boston, moved from school to school during his teaching career but there is no evidence to suggest the moves were because of any allegations made against him. Rowena Kovler, principal at Lehrman while Giovanditto was a teacher there, described him as an 'excellent employee' who was 'adored' by his students. 'Wrong': The mother of a child attending summer camp at the Crossroads Academy in Florida in the '80s, now Kentwood Preparatory School (above), has claimed Giovanditto sexually abused her son 'for years' A spokesman for the former Crossroads Academy, now Kentwood Preparatory School, said he had a clean record, while Rebecca Hendricks, who worked with Giovanditto at the now defunct Villa Oasis boarding school in Arizona, said he was 'phenomenally brilliant' but also strange and narcissistic. She said: 'He stayed very distant from adults and he got very into the kids. I don't think it struck me as predatory back then.' Other former pupils described close relationships with Giovanditto, but said their teacher was never inappropriate towards them. William Wilders, an ex-Villa Oasis student, said he was aware his relationship with his teacher was the subject of gossip. 'People all through the Villa thought bizarre things were happening between me and G,' he said. 'But he never tried anything with me.' 'Idyllic': The body of the former teacher was discovered by neighbours in the Disney-built town of Celebration, Florida . Neighbours discovered Giovanditto's body on the kitchen floor of his Celebration home in November 2010. David-Israel Murillo, the homeless man charged with his murder, told police Giovanditto had approached him and offered him money to wash his car over the Thanksgiving weekend. He claimed Giovanditto gave him a beer, and that he then fell asleep and later awoke to find the former teacher on top of him attempting to sexually assault him. The now 30-year-old said he flew into a rage and bludgeoned Giovanditto with an axe he found in a closet. The murder trial is due to begin next month.","Matteo Patrick Giovanditto, 58, was found dead at his home in Celebration, Florida, U.S. in November 2010 .

Katherine Kerswell is now earning £142,000 to 'reform' the civil service after a £420,000 pay-off from Kent County Council . A former council chief who was given a . £420,000 pay-off last year has now been appointed by the Coalition to . ‘reform’ the civil service - on a salary of £142,000. Katherine Kerswell caused anger when . she walked away with the massive pay-off after just 20 months as head of . Kent County Council. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps condemned the pay-off as ‘deeply concerning’ when details finally emerged in June. Mr Shapps, who was a local government . minister at the time, said: ‘I find dipping into the public purse to . make such an eye-watering pay-off unacceptable’. But last night it was announced that . Mrs Kerswell, 49, has been made the Cabinet Office’s director-general . for civil service reform on a salary of £142,000 a year – just £500 less . than the Prime Minister. Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude . defended the appointment, saying Mrs Kerswell ‘brings experience and . expertise to this crucial role’. Sir Bob Kerslake, head of the civil . service, said he was ‘delighted’ with the appointment, describing Mrs . Kerswell as ‘an accomplished leader with a track record of successful . change management in the wider public sector’. But critics said the appointment . raised questions about the Government’s commitment to tackle the scandal . of council bosses and quangocrats who get huge pay-offs only to walk . into lucrative new jobs in the public sector months later. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude (left) and Sir Bob Kerslake, head of the civil service, have both welcomed Katherine Kerswell's appointment overseeing reform of Whitehall . Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said members of the public were likely to view the appointment with deep suspicion. He said: ‘Katherine Kerswell is the poster girl for senior public sector staff riding the job merry-go-round. 'Despite pocketing vast sums of taxpayers’ money simply for leaving her role at Kent County Council, she has landed yet another role at our expense. ‘Given that Kerswell is in charge of . civil service reform, her first task should be to end the culture of . excessive golden goodbyes with which she is all too familiar.’ 'Riding the job merry-go-round' Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance . Mrs Kerswell, who said she was ‘thrilled’ with her new job, has held a string of top council posts, most recently as the £197,000-a-year ‘managing director’ of Kent County Council. She left in December after axing 1,000 jobs at a cost of almost £11million. The council’s accounts revealed she had received a final year package of £589,165, including a £420,000 pay-off, £139,806 in salary and a £29,359 pension contribution. She sparked fury in her previous job as chief executive of Northamptonshire County Council by arguing that her £197,136 salary was good value as it represented only 29p for each person in the county. She also faced mockery at the time for her love of management speak, which included a ‘Taste the Strawberry’ campaign that encouraged staff to focus on the overall ‘flavour’ of council services. Former employer: Kent County Council in Maidstone . In opposition, the Tories pledged to clamp down on huge public sector payouts. But despite modest reforms, the pattern has continued. Earlier this month it emerged that 450 council chiefs were handed six-figure pay-offs in the last year, with Mrs Kerswell receiving the biggest package of all. An investigation by the Daily Mail revealed that dozens of bosses at regional development agencies also received six-figure pay-offs when the quangos were wound up this year. In many cases those involved landed lucrative jobs in the state sector just days later. Mrs Kerswell will now lead a project designed to ‘reform’ the civil service. Mr Maude said he wanted a civil service that was ‘flatter, faster, more digital, more unified, with better capabilities and performance management, focused on outcomes not process, with modern terms and conditions’.","Ministers condemned Katherine Kerswell's pay-off as 'disturbing and unacceptable'

The Queen wants moves to scrap the word ‘Empire’ from awards such as the OBE and MBE to be put off until after her reign, it was claimed last night. It follows a Labour bid to replace ‘Empire’ with ‘Excellence’ in the titles of the honours because it is a ‘jingoistic relic of Britain’s colonial past’. The moved was resisted after Tory MPs threatened to veto  a Westminster review of the honours system in protest. They insisted that there should be no change until at least  2017, the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Order of the British Empire. A senior source told The Mail on Sunday that the Queen believes honours should stay the same, and any future changes should be dealt with when Prince Charles accedes to the throne. ‘I have been told that her view is, “If it really must be changed, can you please wait until I am no longer Monarch?” ’ said the source. Buckingham Palace last night said: ‘We have no comment on speculation as to Her Majesty’s views on the continued inclusion of the word “Empire” in the honours system.’ Senior Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the Commons Public Administration Select Committee, which investigated the honours system, said last night: ‘If this is the Queen’s view, it is personally understandable. 'An “Order of British Excellence” sounds wet and is the kind of thing that must make her heart sink. It would have been unthinkable when she ascended the throne and would have had her father and grandfather spinning in their graves.’ 'Her father would turn in his grave': The Queen, seen here with Prince Phillip yesterday, has indicated that a change should be avoided at any cost whilst she sits on the throne . Mr Jenkin said Prince Charles should have the final say if  similar reforms were proposed when he succeeds the Queen. ‘Whatever changes are made in the future, the views of the sovereign must be paramount and take precedence over those of politicians,’ he said. Mr Jenkin said he favoured retaining ‘Empire’, but added that if it were to go, it could be changed to Order of the British Commonwealth. ‘The transition from the Empire to the Commonwealth is one of the greatest achievements of the modern Monarchy and to recognise that in awards would be much more in keeping with the tradition and heritage of the honours system,’ he added. OBE: 'Officer of the British Empire' would become Officer of British Excellence' Sharp divisions opened up during a Commons inquiry into the honours system over whether ‘Empire’ should remain in the Order of the British Empire – which includes, in order of seniority, the KBE  or DBE (Knight Commander or Dame Commander), CBE (Commander of the British Empire), OBE (Officer of the British Empire) and MBE (Member of the British Empire). Republican Labour MP Paul Flynn said the Order, created  in 1917, was an outdated ‘relic’ of the ‘jingoism of a country at war’. He said that it should be replaced by ‘Excellence’ – or renamed the British Citizen’s Medal. However, Conservatives refused to agree to the idea and threatened to pull the plug on the entire report. Mr Flynn and fellow Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins issued their own rebel ‘minority report’ in protest. The Queen has a direct personal link to the Empire: her father, George VI, was the last Emperor of India, losing the title in 1947 when the country was granted independence. The hardline decision by Mr Jenkin’s committee to block any change – or even a review – into the matter marked a U-turn. When the same committee  studied it before the last Election, it questioned the continued use of the word ‘Empire’. In its latest report, MPs said they had heard ‘mixed evidence’. Former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling told the inquiry: ‘We do not have one [an empire]. We are making someone a  Commander of the British Empire and we are in no position to offer him such a command.’ But Richard Tilbrook, the Head of the Honours Secretariat in the Cabinet Office, pointed out that when the OBE was created, the statutes made it clear that for any changes to take place, the Order would have to be closed and a new one created. The report concluded: ‘We do not recommend any changes ahead of the Order’s centenary in 2017.’","Queen wants change postponed until Prince Charles ascends the throne .
Change from Empire to Excellence would 'have her father and grandfather spinning in their graves'"
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 07:58 EST, 17 September 2012 . Female-friendly: Saudi women no longer have to deal with the embarrassment of buying lingerie from male staff . Saudi Arabia has ordered the closure . of around 100 lingerie shops in the capital Riyadi which have violated new regulations banning . men from working on their sales staff, it emerged today. A labour ministry official was quoted by the newspaper Al-Eqtisadiah as saying all shops which flouted a decree on the 'feminisation and nationalisation of jobs' would be shut down. The measure aims to 'provide a safe environment for working women,' he said. At the start of this year, the . ministry banned male assistants from working at lingerie shops as a . first step to be followed by women-only sales assistants at cosmetics . outlets. King Abdullah issued the decree to end the 'embarrassment' suffered by women who don't want to give men their measurements. It was also part of an effort to reduce high female unemployment in the conservative kingdom, . currently at around 30 per cent. Saudi women - tired of having to deal . with men when buying undergarments - boycotted lingerie stores to . pressure them to employ women. The country is home to Islam's . holiest site in the city of Mecca and follows an ultra-conservative form . of the religion known as Wahhabism. The kingdom's religious police, under the control of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, enforce Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islam, which prohibits unrelated men and women from mingling. Women and men in Saudi Arabia remain highly segregated and are restricted in how they are allowed to mix in public. Unlikely hero: King Abdullah of Saudia Arabia issued a decree banning men from working in lingerie shops which is now being enforced by the labour ministry . The separation of men and women is not absolute, however. Women . in Saudi Arabia hold high-level teaching positions in universities and . work as engineers, doctors, nurses and a range of other posts. The . strict application of Islamic law forced an untenable situation in . which women, often accompanied by uncomfortable male relatives, have to . buy their intimate apparel from men behind the counter. The ministry banned male assistants from working at lingerie shops as a first step to be followed by women-only sales staff at cosmetics outlets . And with the kingdom boasting 7,353 lingerie shops in total, there is clearly demand from fashion-forward Saudi women. Attire beneath the burka is naturally a very private issue and only for the eyes of a woman's husband. One . option is a shalwar kameez - a loose-fitting trouser dress combination. Also popular, as many high-end fashion houses will attest, is . Western-style clothing.","King issued decree banning men from underwear stores .
