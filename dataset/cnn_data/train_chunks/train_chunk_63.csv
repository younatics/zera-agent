"(CNN) -- Floodwaters covering the Chicago area were receding Sunday, as damages surfaced and communities began the clean-up process. Ten towns in Cook County have declared their communities as disaster areas, said Dave Ramos, executive director for Cook County Emergency Management. Friday night's heavy rains hit Westchester and Melrose Park the hardest, filling some Cook County basements with up to four feet of water, Ramos said. He said he will recommend to the county's president that all of Cook be declared a disaster area Monday. Of the 50,000 ComEd customers who were without electricity Saturday morning, 3,000 remained without power Sunday, said Laura Micheli, a spokeswoman for the utility. ""There is still a lot of flooding obviously,"" Micheli said. ""In some areas they need to wait for water to recede before they're able to restore power."" The outages started at about 6 p.m. (7 p.m. ET) Friday night. There are no reports of missing people, fatalities or injuries to the Cook County 911 center, Ramos said. The National Weather Service predicted pleasant weather Sunday, but flood warnings remained for areas on the nearby Fox and Des Plaines rivers. The area hasn't had any storms since late Saturday morning, Micheli said.","10 towns in Cook County have declared their communities disaster areas .

"(CNN) -- Chris Ferguson remembers being 9 years old, watching astronaut Neil Armstrong take man's first steps on the moon on July 20, 1969. Like thousands in his American generation, Ferguson dreamed in his childhood of becoming an astronaut. ""I was very interested in the space program,"" Ferguson. ""It was something that gripped the world, something that all of the world was talking about."" And unlike all but a very, very few in his generation, he realized his childhood goal. iReport: What did you want to be when you grew up . As an American astronaut, he has logged a total of 28 days in space to date. After receiving his master's degree in aeronautical engineering at the Naval Postgraduate School, Ferguson flew for the U.S. Navy as a pilot, officer and instructor. But his ambitions stretched far beyond the clouds. Ferguson said he tried not to get his hopes too high, and he persistently turned in his forms when NASA accepted astronaut applications. The first three times Ferguson applied, he didn't make the cut. On the fourth try, he was selected as a member of the NASA Astronaut Class of 1999, and he now holds the title of deputy chief of NASA's Astronaut Office. But with no set plans of launching astronauts into orbit from U.S. soil after the final trip to the International Space Station slated for February 2011, Ferguson and others in the space world are anxious. In addition to fretting about funding and jobs, they wonder if the government is losing an initiative that engages the next generation of engineers and mathematicians. ""If we aren't doing things that inspire them, we'll suffer from the creative standpoint,"" he said. Teresa Gomez, assistant manager for NASA's Astronaut Selection Office, said that most applicants who make it to the interview rounds have been grooming themselves their entire lives for the job. In past years, candidates said it was the first lunar landing that sparked their interest in space. More recently, astronaut hopefuls said it was the first shuttle landing they saw that hooked them on aeronautics, Gomez said. Many number-crunchers and rocket builders in the space exploration field also say they were space junkies in their younger years. ""It appeared as pure magic to see something so massive lift off the Earth,"" said Brad Toellner, an aerospace engineer major who has been working at NASA as a part of its Cooperative Education Program for the past four years. ""It seemed so different from everyday life."" NASA and the commercial space community are waiting to hear the hard federal funding numbers to determine if, when and how American astronauts can go back into space. President Barack Obama's NASA proposal currently being scrutinized by Congress focuses on researching propulsion for deep space and asteroid landings. It scraps the Constellation Project, which was launched six years ago with the aim of sending humans to Mars and back to the moon. The proposal would also halt NASA shuttle launches to the International Space Station. Instead, federal funds would be used to help send U.S. commercial shuttles to the station. Clark Moody, who remembers watching NASA videos with his dad in the 1980s, is a graduate student in aerospace engineering at Texas A&M University. He worries that NASA's other feats could be lost on the general public without the highly visible human spaceflight endeavors. ""When most people think of NASA, they think of NASA spaceflight and don't know 99 percent of what (else) it does,"" Moody said. ""That's what gets people really excited when they're younger."" Others think there are cheaper ways to inspire young scientists than with NASA manned space missions. ""What are we trying to do here?"" asked Roger Launius, the senior curator of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. ""If we're trying to inspire kids, is this the way to do it, at $20 billion a year?"" he questioned, referring to the cost of sending humans to the moon. He said NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers -- active twin robots that were launched in 2003 to research the planet's water history -- should also grab young people's interest. Robert Cort, the acting deputy manager of White Sands Test Facility in southern New Mexico, said he and others reach out to elementary and middle school children in the area to tell them that with hard work, they can be a part of the local space program efforts. The facility conducts safety tests for NASA, but most children say they want to be flying, not testing. He's also worried that the manned spaceflight hiatus could damper children's interest in NASA. Cort said many students tell him they'll be astronauts when they grow up. In return, he said, he tells them, ""Hey, that's great, and if you do, we'll work to protect you,"" so as not to give them false hope. The odds have historically been against those whose ambitions are out of this world. Since 1978, only .6 percent of astronaut applicants have been hired, according to NASA statistics. Launius said there's potential for humans to travel farther with NASA's new vision, including turning shuttles over to commercial organizations. ""I'm not anxious,"" he said, ""I'm curious as to where it'll go."" He said he's hopeful that commercial space entities will be successful and progress human space travel more efficiently than NASA's past vision. Many others involved in aerospace, while holding their breath as Congress holds the American space program in limbo, are excited about the prospects of more people having the chance to travel into space -- including NASA's chief deputy astronaut. Ferguson and most other astronauts paid for their shuttle tickets with post-graduate degrees and years in the military. But, if commercial organizations take over NASA's suborbital shuttle missions, the next generation's astronauts might purchase their ticket as they would a bus or plane ticket. For his entire life, Ferguson said, he had imagined watching a sunrise from space. He finally had the chance as pilot of the STS-115 shuttle mission to the International Space Station in 2006. Watching the sun light up the underside of Earth, staining the ocean blue and the land green, was what he called a ""gee-whiz moment."" ""Space shouldn't just be reserved for those who've taken 10 years learning how to work a rocket,"" Ferguson said. Instead, as the space program evolves, it could be reserved for those willing to put a couple hundred thousand dollars down as soon as the next decade, according to John Gedmark, executive director of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation.","Astronaut Chris Ferguson says human spaceflight inspired him when he was younger .

"From the Gulf Coast (CNN) -- I love animals and I love the outdoors. The Gulf of Mexico and the coastline that surrounds it is a special place to me and millions of other Americans. Right now there are more than 40,000 people working to save it in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. They're trying to plug the well, save the wildlife and clean up the oil. Seeing the oil and the action up close is one thing. Getting your hands dirty and feeling the enormity of the job is another. I now understand what it takes. Of course, the big difference between me and them is they do it every day. All day. Sometimes all night. Without complaint. These are the heroes doing their part to save the Gulf of Mexico. When the spill happened I assumed all you needed was a few skimmers to surround the slick and suck up the oil. How na√Øve I am. One thing I've learned reporting in this oil disaster: Nothing is as easy as it seems it should be. My embed on the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Elm showed me the dirty, slippery and agonizingly slow process of skimming weathered Gulf sweet crude. It's a nasty business. Searching for, rescuing, rehabilitating and releasing oiled wildlife is also a process that requires agility, patience and, most of all, a gentle touch. My embed with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had me based on a barge in the middle of the marsh. I followed fellow animal lovers on a hunt for oiled wildlife. The rescued birds were brought to the International Bird Rescue Research Center in Buras, Louisiana, where they're cleaned, given medical care and nursed back to health. I got to hand feed a sick baby pelican -- an emotional moment words can't describe -- followed by transporting rehabilitated birds to Texas, where we released them into an oil-free wildlife refuge. Another emotion-filled spiritual rush. Cleaning the beach seems easy. Well, it's not -- especially in 100-degree blazing sun and relentless humidity. I took the required hazmat training course and suited up for a full day of tar ball pickin' fun. OK, it wasn't really fun -- but it made decent TV. ""Rescue"" wraps up on the lighter side with an appreciation for the guys working the beach dressed in rubber and Tyvek. I had the opportunity to go shoulder-to-shoulder with the men and women out here getting it done, and it's an experience I'll never forget. I hope you'll join me on the journey and tune in to ""Rescue: Saving the Gulf.""

"Washington (CNN) -- An infected flash drive put in a U.S. military laptop in 2008 set off the most significant cyberattack ever against the military and brought a turning point in cyberdefense strategy, a top defense official wrote in an article published Wednesday. Deputy Defense Secretary William J. Lynn III, in an article titled ""Defending a New Domain"" posted on Foreign Affairs magazine's web site, said the ""previously classified incident was the most significant breach of U.S. military computers ever."" According to Lynn, the attack served as ""an important wake-up call"" that led to a new Pentagon counterattack strategy dubbed Operation Buckshot. ""An enormous amount of foundational work remains, but the U.S. government has begun putting in place various initiatives to defend the United States in the digital age,"" Lynn's article said. The attack started with the infected laptop at a U.S. base in the Middle East, according to Lynn. ""The flash drive's malicious computer code, placed there by a foreign intelligence agency, uploaded itself onto a network run by the U.S. Central Command,"" his article said. ""That code spread undetected on both classified and unclassified systems, establishing what amounted to a digital beachhead, from which data could be transferred to servers under foreign control."" He continued: ""It was a network administrator's worst fear: a rogue program operating silently, poised to deliver operational plans into the hands of an unknown adversary."" Lynn's article provided no details on specific files lost or stolen in the attack, which he called one of countless attempts to intrude into U.S. military networks. Others also have succeeded, he said, with adversaries acquiring ""thousands of files from U.S. networks and from the networks of U.S. allies and industry partners, including weapons blueprints, operational plans, and surveillance data."" In response, he wrote, the Pentagon has built layered defenses around military networks and launched the new U.S. Cyber Command to ""integrate cyberdefense operations across the military."" ""The Pentagon is now working with the Department of Homeland Security to protect government networks and critical infrastructure and with the United States' closest allies to expand these defenses internationally,"" Lynn wrote.","Top defense official details previously classified cyberattack .

"(CNN) -- International outcry -- and the pleas of a devoted son -- seem to have saved an Iranian woman from being stoned to death for adultery. But while Sakineh Mohammedie Ashitani has been granted a reprieve, she is not the only woman sentenced to be stoned for adultery in Iran. There have been at least six sentences carried out since 2006, says Ann Harrison, an Iran expert at Amnesty International in London. Adultery is the only crime that carries such a penalty in Iranian law, she said. Only a handful of countries have laws calling for stoning, and Iran is the only one that carries out executions that way, Amnesty International records suggest. That is because Islam doesn't really want the punishment to be carried out, says Ziba Mir-Hosseini, an Iranian-born campaigner against the practice. ""Stoning is not a Quranic punishment, it is Islamic jurisprudence. It happened later,"" says Mir-Hosseini, an expert on Iranian family law at London's School of Oriental and African Studies. ""The punishment for any kind of sexual relations (outside of marriage) in the Quran is 100 lashes,"" she says. Stoning is based on sayings from the Prophet Mohammed, known collectively as the hadith, says Mohammed Ali Musawi, a research fellow at the Quilliam Foundation, which describes itself as an ""anti-extremist think tank."" Under the letter of Islamic law, it's nearly impossible to prove adultery, he says. ""How you prove adultery or fornication is to have four male witnesses -- or two women for every male equivalent -- all of them known to be upright, with no questions about their moral character, who witnessed the actual act of intercourse between the male and the female,"" he says. ""Basically, in normal life, this is next to impossible, to have four people testify that in the same place, at the same time, they saw the act of penetration,"" he argues. False testimony can itself be punished with whipping, he says, because ""it is such a severe sin."" ""As you can imagine, if people were following these laws as they are stated, there would be next to no stonings,"" he says. Even if someone confesses to serious sexual impropriety, they should be sent away three times to reconsider their confessions, he says, and only punished if they have admitted it four times, he adds. But Iranian law is different, Mir-Hosseini says. ""In the case of this woman and other cases, the standard is 'the judge's knowledge,'"" she says -- in other words, whether the judges believe adultery has been committed. She sees stoning as a way of putting pressure on women, she says, particularly in provincial areas. ""So far there have been no sentences of stoning in Tehran, only in the provinces. It happens when the judge has a grudge against the woman,"" she argues, although she notes that only the Iranian Ministry of Justice has full records of how many stonings there have been, and where. Men, too, can be stoned for adultery in Iran, she says. The practice was banned under the secularizing Iranian shahs of the early 20th century, she says, then reinstated after the Islamic revolution of 1979. ""After the revolution, one of the first things the clerics wanted to do was put aside the 1920 secular legal code,"" which was based on French law, she explains. ""In 1982, the parliament called for Islamic punishments,"" she says. There was some resistance from senior clerics, but the founder of the revolution, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, intervened to get it passed. Stoning remained law in the updated 1992 penal code, she says, but in the first draft of a 2007 revision, it wasn't there. ""After the intervention of (hard-line President Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad, it was restored,"" she says. That new legal code has not yet been approved, she says. It's not clear who will win the battle over the code working its way through the system now, she says, but it does include a potentially face-saving way to keep stoning on the books without having to carry it out. ""There is a provision that, in cases where stoning causes harm to Islam, it can be substituted with other punishments,"" she says. She thinks it's no accident that people are being stoned these days, amid political unrest in Iran. ""It has become a political matter,"" she contends. ""Whenever there is a dispute between traditionalists and reformers in the judiciary,"" stonings increase. ""Stoning is one of those issues that has really (been problematic) for the Islamic republic because it is not accepted by society, including the judiciary,"" she claims. But there continue to be stonings, she says, because ""like anywhere else, you have hardliners. You have radicals.""","Adultery is only crime that carries penalty of stoning in Iran .

"(CNN) -- Amid heightened tensions with North Korea, the United States and South Korea on Sunday began joint military exercises, according to a spokesman for U.S. Forces Korea. The military exercise, dubbed Invincible Spirit, is scheduled to run through Wednesday and demonstrate the alliance's resolve. In addition to the 8,000 personnel involved, military officials say, it will include 20 ships and submarines and about 200 aircraft. The U.S. Defense Department said the drills are in response to the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan and are intended to send a strong message to Pyongyang to stop ""provocative and warlike acts."" North Korea criticized the exercises, which began at 6:30 a.m. (5:30 p.m. ET). ""The U.S. provocations amount to trespassing on the off-limits fixed by the DPRK and it, therefore, feels no need to remain bounded to the off-limits drawn by the U.S.,"" the state-run Korean Central News Agency quoted a North Korean foreign ministry spokesman as saying. Why are the two Koreas so hostile? It continued, ""It is the mode of the DPRK's counteraction to react to sword brandishing in kind. The DPRK is prepared for both dialogue and war. It will remain unfazed by military threat and sanctions."" The carrier USS George Washington and South Korean carrier Dokdo will lead the naval aspects of Invincible Spirit on the eastern coast of South Korea, said U.S. Army Col. Jonathan Withington of USFK. North Korea on Saturday heightened its threats against the military exercises after talks over the sinking of the Cheonan. North Korea ""will legitimately counter with [its] powerful nuclear deterrence the largest-ever nuclear war exercises to be staged by the U.S. and the South Korean puppet forces,"" KCNA reported. Two U.S. military officials told CNN there was no sign of significant troop movement in North Korea. Meanwhile Friday, in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas, officers from the North sat down for talks about the Cheonan incident with their counterparts in the U.S.-led United Nations Command. During the almost two-hour meeting in the international truce town of Panmunjom, the U.N. Command reminded the North Koreans of the Security Council's condemnation this month of the Cheonan attack. The Security Council did not mention North Korea by name but condemned the attack strongly, called for ""full adherence"" to the armistice agreement that halted fighting in the Korean War in 1953 and encouraged ""the settlement of outstanding issues on the Korean peninsula by peaceful means."" An international inquiry found North Korea culpable for the March attack that killed 46 South Korean sailors. But North Korea denies a role in the incident, which elevated tension between the two enemies. North Korea demanded again Friday that it be allowed to conduct its own investigation of the Cheonan's sinking and said the upcoming war games are being conducted under false pretext. ""The U.S. forces side would be seriously mistaken if it calculates it can browbeat [North Korea] through large-scale war exercises,"" KCNA said. ""It should immediately stop the [anti-North Korean] nuclear war racket."" At the ASEAN meeting, nation after nation expressed deep regrets and offered condolences to the South Koreans. The United States has accused North Korea of aggressive behavior and imposed new sanctions Wednesday. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reiterated U.S. support for South Korea on Friday. ""Here in Asia, an isolated and belligerent North Korea has embarked on a campaign of provocative, dangerous behavior,"" she said in Hanoi, Vietnam. Later, after a repatriation ceremony for the remains of three soldiers who died in the Vietnam War, Clinton said the door remains open for dialogue if North Korea commits to abandoning its nuclear weapons program. ""We would love for them to have the same opportunities that the people of South Korea have been able to enjoy for the last 60 years,"" Clinton said. ""So, it is distressing when North Korea continues its threats and causes so much anxiety among its neighbors and the larger region."" CNN's Barbara Starr and Eve Bower contributed to this report.","South Korea, U.S. begin joint exercises .

"(CNN) -- When faced with bullies at school, one 11-year-old girl decided not to fight back with her fists. Instead, she sought help from a higher source: She wrote to President Barack Obama. To her surprise, the president replied to the letter personally. ""My mom, she taught me violence never solves the problem,"" Zianey Stokes of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said Friday. ""At my school, we're not supposed to hit no other child, and I didn't want to do that, because I'm not a violent person."" In her letter, Stokes described the bullying she saw and experienced at school. ""They would torment me. They would take my lunch and call me names and talk about my family members. ... They talked about my clothes and how I look,"" she said. In his reply, Obama said he was glad she wrote to share her story. ""Your letter demonstrates a desire to change the culture of your classroom as well as your community. ""Bullying, whether in person or online ... is never OK. All of us must recognize that our shared experience and our unique differences are what make this nation so special,"" the letter reads. ""You deserve a safe and enjoyable classroom and together we will strive to make it a reality."" When she discovered the letter in her mailbox, Stokes was ""excited, and I was happy, and I wanted to cry."" The president's letter inspired her to start an anti-bullying club at her school, she said, and she wants to found an organization called No Kids Should Be Bullied. ""I would like to thank him for writing me back,"" she said, adding that things have gotten much better with the bullies at school. ""They're just really trying to be my friend,"" she said. And as for her future, Stokes has that figured out, too. ""I'm becoming a writer ... or the president of the United States.""","11-year-old Zianey Stokes writes president about bullies at school .

"(CNN) -- Searchers looking for the airplane that slammed into the side of a tree-covered Alaskan mountainside earlier this month couldn't detect an emergency locator signal after the impact damaged the craft's transmitter, according to a federal report released on Wednesday. The National Transportation Safety Board issued a preliminary report about the August 9 accident that killed five people, including former Sen.Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and injured four others. ""No emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal was detected during the aerial search,"" the report said, ""Examination of the wreckage revealed that the ELT had separated from its mounting bracket during impact, and the antenna cable was found separated from the ELT."" Weather conditions at the time of the accident were ""not known,"" the report said, but Alaska Air National Guard rescuers were hampered by poor weather and terrain -- slogging for hours through rain, fog and wind to reach the rugged mountainside in southwestern Alaska. The closest weather reporting station, at Dillingham Airport, about 18 miles south of the accident site, reported light rain and mist in cloudy and overcast conditions, with winds gusting to more than 26 mph just 10 minutes after the accident took place. ""At the time of the accident, marginal visual meteorological conditions were reported at the Dillingham Airport,"" the report said. The four survivors included Willy Phillips Jr., 13. His father, former Stevens staffer Bill Phillips Sr., was among the five people killed in the crash. The other survivors were former NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe and his 19-year-old son, Kevin, and Jim Moorhard of Alexandria, Virginia. Along with Stevens, 86, and Bill Phillips, the others who died were pilot Terry Smith, 62, of Eagle River, Alaska; Dana Tindall, 48, of Anchorage, Alaska; and Corey Tindall, 16, of Anchorage, Alaska. Autopsies on the five victims found the deaths were the result of blunt force trauma, injuries consistent with this type of crash, state officials said. The report said the de Havilland DHC-3T Otter -- a single-engine, turbine-powered, amphibious float-equipped craft -- ""sustained substantial damage"" when it crashed about 10 miles northeast of Aleknagik about 2:45 p.m. Alaska Daylight Time. it said the airplane was registered to and operated by General Communication Corporation in Anchorage and the flight ""originated from a GCI-owned remote fishing lodge on the southwest shoreline of Lake Nerka"" about 2:30 p.m. It was headed to a ""remote sport fishing camp on the banks of the Nushagak River, located about 52 miles southeast of the lodge."" No flight plan had been filed. A GCI representative said the pilot telephoned people at the camp to say the plane would arrive there, but a couple of hours later the plane had not arrived. ""The GCI lodge manager then initiated a phone and radio search to see if the airplane had diverted to Dillingham, Alaska or if it was en route back to the GCI lodge. Unable to locate the airplane, GCI lodge personnel initiated an aerial search along the pilot's anticipated route,"" the report said. Volunteers flying planes and helicopters joined in the search. About 8:05 p.m., air searchers spotted the wreckage ""along the anticipated flight route, about 900 feet above mean sea level in the Muklung Hills, in steep, heavily wooded terrain, about 19 miles southeast of the GCI lodge."" Searchers reached the accident site by helicopter and ""confirmed that the pilot and four passengers died at the scene, and four passengers sustained serious injuries."" More rescue crew members were prevented from reaching the site at the time by ""poor weather and dark night conditions"" But the next morning, Coast Guard and Air National Guard helicopters evacuated everyone from the site.","Report on August 9 crash says searchers detected no locator signal .

"(CNN) -- Erykah Badu must pay a $500 fine and serve six months on probation for her naked stroll through downtown Dallas, Texas, while making a music video last March, a city official confirmed Tuesday. Badu reached a plea deal to settle a misdemeanor disorderly conduct citation issued after she released a music video, according to Dallas spokesman Jose Torres. The singer shed her clothes as she walked through Dealey Plaza until she was nude and then fell near where President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Badu said the video was ""shot guerrilla style,"" without a crew and in one take March 17, 2010. Badu then posted a message on her Twitter account acknowledging that ""there were children there."" She said she prayed they wouldn't be traumatized by seeing her naked. It wasn't until several days after the video for the song ""Window Seat"" was released on March 28 that anyone who witnessed the taping filed a complaint with Dallas Police. Only then did police issue a citation against Badu. Under the plea agreement, the offense will be erased from Badu's criminal record if she successfully completes the 180 days probation. ""If she violates any law at the city, state or federal level, a motion to adjudicate (seeking to revoke probation) will be filed,"" Torres said. ""If the motion to adjudicate is granted, Ms. Badu will have a criminal conviction."" CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report .","Badu's plea deal includes 6 months probation and a $500 fine .

"Munyonyo, Uganda (CNN) -- Heads of 35 African nations observed two minutes of silence Sunday to honor more than 70 people killed in terrorist bomb blasts in Uganda earlier this month as the African Union summit opened. ""Our condolences go to the people of Uganda for the tragic loss of lives following that tragic incident,"" said Bingu Wa Mutharika, AU chairman and Malawian president. ""Terrorism has no place in Africa; it has no place in the developing world,"" he said. ""Let us all condemn these acts."" The summit, which formally opened Sunday following a week of conferences, is being held at a resort hotel in Munyonyo, about 12 kilometers south of the Ugandan capital of Kampala on the shore of Lake Victoria. On July 11, three bombs at two sites in Kampala killed 74 people and injured more than 80. Many of the victims had gathered to watch the World Cup finals. The Al-Shabaab militant group, which is currently battling the weak transitional government in war-torn Somalia, claimed responsibility for the bombings, saying they were in retaliation for Uganda's contribution of troops for peacekeeping operations in Somalia. About 6,000 Ugandan and Burundian troops were deployed for the peacekeeping mission more than two years ago in the Horn of Africa nation, which has been at war for more than a decade. Mutharika, in his remarks, stopped short of making any commitment toward AU peacekeeping missions in Somali and the Darfur region of Sudan. However, AU Commission Chairman Jean Ping said on Friday that Guinea and Djibouti have battalions of soldiers ready to be be deployed to Somalia. Forty-three heads of state have said they will attend the Summit. Thirty-five had arrived by Sunday, including Libya's Moammar Gadhafi and Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan. ""While people were enjoying the World Cup, Uganda was having the dark side of it,"" Jonathan told the conference. ""Nigeria condemns that terrorist attack on innocent people in totality and we stand in solidarity with Uganda."" While the theme of the three-day summit is maternal, infant and child health, the subject has been overshadowed by the Ugandan attacks, the deteriorating security situation in Somalia and the attacks by Al-Shabaab. ""We find the terrorist bomb attacks in Kampala despicable,"" Ping told attendees Friday. ""We welcome the pledges of other countries in providing the troops to Somalia, including from Djibouti, which already has a battalion ready."" Ping said he has been discussing the issue throughout the week with various African authorities and by the end of the summit, he expects more nations to pledge troops to Somalia peacekeeping efforts. The attacks are cause for Africa to change its stance on terrorism, Adris Piebalgs, European Union commissioner for development, told reporters at the summit. ""The recent bombings in Kampala have changed things greatly. We have just witnessed AU leadership during the opening of the summit today paying more attention on terrorism coming (from) Somalia,"" Piebalgs said. ""We are seeing real commitment, with more countries contributing to the AU peacekeeping mission in Somalia."" The EU will continue its support of the mission, he said, and urges more African nations to get involved and ""deal with the problem."" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder also spoke at the summit, saying the United States ""recognizes that ending the threat of al-Shabaab to the world will take more than just law enforcement. That is why we are working closely with the AU to support the African Union's mission in Somalia ... we pledge to maintain our support."" The United States also recognizes that ending the threat of al-Shabaab to the world will take more than just law enforcement.  That is why we are working closely with the AU to support the African Union's Mission in Somalia.  The United States applauds the heroic contributions that are being made on a daily basis by Ugandan and Burundian troops, and we pledge to maintain our support for the AU and the AU Mission in Somalia. Some 20 people have been arrested in connection with the Kampala blasts, Ugandan leader Yoweri Museveni told the summit, and have been giving investigators ""useful"" information about terrorist operations. ""The organizers of these attacks have been arrested. Their interrogations are yielding useful information,"" Museveni said. ""I have great contempt for the authors of terrorism,"" he told the summit. ""... They attack innocent people. I recommend (to) the AU leaders not to accept this terrorist arrogance."" Museveni told the summit the mandate of the AU peacekeeping mission in Somalia should be changed, with troops able to beyond Mogadishu and hunt Al-Shabaab and other militant groups. Piebalgs said he would support a wider mandate for the mission from the United Nations Security Council, and urged AU leadership to seek it. Somali insurgents reportedly killed two Ugandan peacekeepers this week in attacks on AU and government military positions in Somalia's battered capital, Mogadishu. ""How can these people dare attack the AU flag?"" Museveni said. ""These terrorists can be and should be defeated. Let us act in concert and sweep them out of Africa. Let them go back to Asia and the Middle East where they came from.""","African leaders offer their condolences for the Uganda bombings .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Mechanical failures caused a North Korean air force plane to lose direction before crashing in northeastern China earlier this week, state media quoted Chinese authorities as saying Thursday. China's official Xinhua news agency said that Pyongyang has apologized to Beijing for the incident and the two sides have ""reached a consensus on dealing with the aftermath."" The plane went down Tuesday at Lagu township in Fushun county, killing the pilot and destroying one home on the ground. The crash site in Liaoning province is about 200 kilometers (120 miles) away from a North Korean air base in the border town of Sinuiju, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. An employee at Songgang Iron Mine, a company near the crash site, told CNN Wednesday that armed police officers and special forces agents immediately cordoned off the area after the plane went down. Photographs of the wreckage purportedly taken by an eyewitness have been circulating on Chinese websites, showing the North Korean air force emblem on the fuselage beneath the tail of the aircraft. Military enthusiasts online have identified it as a Russian-built MiG jet but differed on the specific model, with some calling it a MiG-21 fighter and others claiming it to be a MiG-15 trainer. Xinhua's latest report did not give details on the plane. Yonhap had earlier quoted unnamed sources in South Korea as saying the plane's pilot may have been trying to defect from North Korea to Russia. Chinese commentators had speculated that the plane may have run out of fuel.","Chinese authorities say mechanical failures caused the pilot to lose direction .

"New York (CNN) -- A coalition of at least 40 religious and civic organizations Wednesday announced the creation of an alliance to show support for the Islamic community center and mosque proposed to be built near New York's ground zero. The group has launched a website -- nyneighbors.org -- and announced a candlelight vigil to be held at the site of the proposed center on the eve of the ninth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attack. Members of the coalition gathered at a municipal building in Manhattan to announce the group's creation. Talat Hamdani, whose son was killed in the attack, told CNN on Wednesday, ""The issue is not about location. It is about our rights as Americans."" ""All those people who died that day ...  they were murdered for being Americans. We should honor those people who were murdered that day by living up to America's core values,"" Hamdani said. Even as some relatives of 9/11 victims showed support for the Islamic center's construction, others held their ground in opposing it. ""This is nothing short of a provocation, an insult to the families of people who were murdered, whose bodies were scattered all across that site,"" said Debra Burlingame, the sister of the pilot whose hijacked plane crashed into the Pentagon.  She sits on the World Trade Center Memorial and Museum board of directors. ""I've had families who have told us their PTSD has come back because of the idea of a mosque being built over where their loved ones died,"" she told CNN this week. ""The idea of a mosque is horrific to them."" She said Imam Abdul Rauf, who is behind the project, did not approach families of 9/11 victims, but she would welcome any discussion with him. ""I would have told him, if he had come to us, that it would hurt people,"" she said. ""This is hurting people who have already been deeply hurt."" Rauf's wife, Daisy Khan, executive director of  the American Society for Muslim Advancement, told the Council on Foreign Relations on Wednesday the proximity to ground zero was never planned.  ""We were establishing the center in a neighborhood we were already in,"" she said.  ""It was our neighborhood. Nine-eleven was our tragedy as much as it was anyone else's tragedy."" Khan said the voices of moderate, mainstream Muslims are being drowned out by extremists. ""The center will combine the best of what it is to be Muslim and what it is to be American. ... The core values of both are totally compatible."" On Tuesday, New York Gov. David Paterson met with Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan, who had offered to mediate in the situation. After the meeting, Dolan urged advocates on both sides of the issue to ratchet down their rhetoric. At an Iftar dinner marking the breaking of the Ramadan fast Tuesday evening, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg forcefully affirmed his support for the project. ""We are Americans, each with an equal right to worship and pray where we choose. There is nowhere in the five boroughs of New York City that is off limit to any religion,"" he told an audience at Gracie Mansion that included the center's developer, Sharif el-Gamal. The Islamic center's leaders say plans for the $100 million facility call for a community center including a mosque, performing arts center, gym, swimming pool and other public spaces. It will be built on property the center already owns, two blocks from where the World Trade Center was destroyed by Islamic extremists on September 11, 2001. The attacks killed more than 2,700 people. CNN's Mark Norman and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","Coalition formed to show support for Islamic center near New York's ground zero .

"(CNN) -- Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard and opposition leader Tony Abbott moved their only televised election debate so they wouldn't clash with the finale of ""MasterChef Australia"" Sunday -- but their switch forced Kylie Minogue to change her schedule. The politicians didn't want to go up against the cooking showdown, Australia's most popular program, so they started their debate an hour earlier than tradition dictates. That should have put them up against ""Dancing With the Stars,"" where Kylie was scheduled to make a guest appearance, Australia's Daily Telegraph reported. The Australian pop star is making her first round of appearances on television Down Under in a decade. Channel 7, the network that shows ""Dancing with the Stars,"" is known for its news coverage, so they had little choice but to cover the debate, the channel's head of programming told the Daily Telegraph. ""We didn't really have any option -- we're the number one for news and we have to cover the election debate live. It was a very short discussion,"" said the channel's head of programming, Tim Worner. That pushed Kylie's ""Dancing with the Stars"" show back an hour -- putting it into competition with ""MasterChef."" MasterChef attracted nearly 3 million viewers in last week's episode, Australian Associated Press reported. About 1.3 million people watched ""Dancing with the Stars"" last week, according to Worner. Gillard last week called an election for August 21. She ousted Kevin Rudd as leader of Australia's Labor Party, and prime minister, in June. Gillard was Rudd's deputy prime minister, but Labor Party members of Parliament voted her into the top job as Rudd's public approval declined. Conservative opposition leader Tony Abbott was quick to condemn Gillard's government when she called the election. ""The prime minister wants to move forward because the recent past is so littered with her own failures,"" he said. Gillard, a 48-year-old lawyer, said when she became prime minister that she was aware the move made her the nation's first woman in that position, ""and maybe the first redhead."" But, she said at the time, ""I didn't set out to crash my head on any glass ceilings; I set out to keep my feet on the floor."" Since taking over, she has established a sizable lead in public approval polls over opposition leader Abbott. A Herald/Nielsen poll released just before the election was called said 56 percent of those surveyed preferred Gillard as prime minister, while only 35 percent supported Abbott. CNN's John Raedler contributed to this report.","Contenders for top job reschedule their debate for ""MasterChef Australia""

"Washington (CNN) -- The District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, and Rhode Island are all to receive a portion of the $3.4 billion remaining in the ""Race to the Top"" fund for education in those states. ""We had many more competitive applications than money to fund them in this round,"" Education Secretary Arne Duncan said Tuesday. ""Race to the Top"" is an Obama administration initiative to award money to states that show that they have a plan for school reforms in four main areas: turning around low performing schools, adopting college and career ready standards, effective teachers and principals, and using data systems to support student achievement. Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia applied for the second round of competition, and of those, 19 were listed as finalists by the Department of Education in July. Those finalists all sent representatives to Washington in August to present their case to a group of peer reviewers. Massachusetts received the highest score in the second round of competition followed by New York and Hawaii. Sometimes, it's just about finishing the test. In the first phase of the competition, Hawaii turned in an incomplete application.  In the second phase, not only did they turn in a completed application, but they were awarded with a grant of $75 million. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist thanked the teachers' unions for their success.  In that state, 54 local teacher unions signed on to their plans. ""This level of participation far exceeds the five local teacher unions who joined our efforts during Phase 1,"" he said in a statement. Tennessee and Delaware both won grants under the program in the first round which was announced earlier this year. Over the next four years, Tennessee will receive $400 million and Delaware will receive $100 million for their programs. For the second round, the Department of Education announced that it would be limiting the amount that any given state can receive. The limits are based on the student population of that state. So, large states like New York and Florida can receive as much as $700 million while smaller states like Hawaii, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia are limited to $75 million grants. The grants will be awarded in installments over the next four years.  And state education departments need to spend the money according to the plans they submitted.  In a conference call with reporters, Duncan said he would pull funding from states that he feels are not ""acting in good faith."" Duncan said he hopes Tuesday's announcement is not the end of the program. ""We're very hopeful there will be a Phase 3 of 'Race to the Top' and have requested $1.35 billion dollars in next year's budget,"" he said.","Nine states plus the District of Columbia are winners .
Each will receive a portion of $3.4 billion .
Winners had to show they have plans for school reforms ."
"(CNN) -- Rumors that the Pentagon or CIA were somehow involved in the sex crime accusations against WikiLeaks founder and editor Julian Assange in Sweden are ""complete nonsense,"" the attorney for the alleged victims said Tuesday. Claes Borgstrom of the Swedish law firm Borgstrom and Bostrom said the two women he represents have nothing to do with any kind of conspiracy. ""What I can say is that those rumors that the Pentagon or the CIA are supposed to be involved lack all connection with reality,"" Borgstrom said from Stockholm, Sweden. The women ""have been subjected to sexual crimes, and the added pressure of the intense worldwide media interest has been very hard on them,"" he added. A warrant issued Friday for Assange in Sweden listed charges of rape and molestation, but it was revoked less than a day later by Chief Prosecutor Eva Finne. Finne said Monday that she had not spoken to Assange. Leif Silbersky, the lawyer representing Assange, said Tuesday that his client strongly denies all the accusations. ""His view is that he has not done anything that is morally and legally wrong,"" Silbersky said. He also denounced the prosecutor who identified Assange to the media. ""Normally they should neither confirm nor deny the identity of a suspect, but in this case the prosecutor made two serious mistakes: The first was that she so quickly arrested Assange in his absence over a very serious crime without finding out all facts first. The second was that she confirmed his identity to the media. That, to me, almost constitutes a serious misconduct,"" Silbersky said. The website founded by Assange, WikiLeaks, has triggered controversy by recently posting 76,000 U.S. documents related to the war in Afghanistan, a move that has drawn criticism from both the U.S. and Afghanistan. Another 15,000 documents are to be released soon, Assange has said. He told the Arab-language television network Al-Jazeera on Sunday that the accusations are ""clearly a smear campaign."" ""The only question is, who was involved?"" he asked. He told the Swedish daily newspaper Aftonbladet in a story Sunday that he doesn't know who was behind it, ""but we have been warned that, for example, the Pentagon is planning on using dirty tricks to destroy our work."" He said he was also warned about ""sex traps."" Asked by the paper whether he has fallen for one of those traps, he said, ""Maybe. Maybe not."" When asked Monday whether the Department of Defense had any involvement in the charges or the allegations, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman replied, ""No, that's ridiculous."" Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd also denied that the department had any involvement in the situation. Silbersky declined to comment on the conspiracy allegations. Borgstrom said the two alleged victims contacted him over the weekend, and he met with them Monday. One is about 25 years old, and the other woman is about 35 years old, he said, but he did not want to give any more details about his clients for fear that they'll be identified. ""I also can't give any details of the events. Assange has not been heard yet, and giving out any details could interfere with the investigation,"" Borgstrom said. ""What I can say is that these are two Swedish women who have had two experiences completely independent of one another. They are not friends from before, but these events were connected with Assange's tour in Sweden."" Borgstrom says Assange's actions should be classified as at least sexual molestation. ""I understand why the prosecutor judged one incident as rape. My judgment is that the two women have been subjected to at least sexual molestation,"" he said, adding that there are still many questions about the incidents that need to be answered. Assange told Aftonbladet that he had never, ""either in Sweden nor in any other country, had sex with anyone in a way that was not based on both sides being completely voluntary."" Borgstrom also criticized the prosecutor for not questioning Assange immediately in the case. ""It is obvious that he is a suspect of sex crimes, and if he leaves the country, then we may never be able to hear his explanation,"" the attorney explained. The fear that Assange might leave Sweden was apparently what provoked the warrant last week, according to a statement posted Monday on the Sweden Prosecution Authority's website. The prosecutor ""decided that Julian Assange was to be arrested,"" based on information that police gave her over the phone about the allegations -- a typical procedure, authorities said. ""The prosecutor was also made aware that the individual concerned was a foreign national and that he was about to leave the country,"" the chronology said. One reason for issuing the warrant was ""that there was a risk that he would have time to leave the country before authorities had time to interrogate him. There was also a risk that he could have interfered with the investigation."" A group that claims to work to protect individuals' legal rights in the Swedish justice system said Monday that it has reported the on-call prosecutor to the Swedish Parliamentary Ombudsman of Justice. It was unclear what action, if any, the ombudsman could take against the prosecutor. ""We can see that, time after time, prosecutors don't follow the Swedish objectivity laws,"" said Johann Binninge, founder of the Organisation for Safe Legal Proceedings. ""When accusations come in, prosecutors don't even check facts before they take coercive measures, and this is contrary to Swedish laws. In this case, the prosecutor only listened to one individual's story but didn't bother checking the other side of the story before accusing Mr. Assange of a very serious crime. This is why we have reported her."" News of the warrant reached a Swedish media outlet, the prosecution authority said, but ""the authority does not know how this happened, and the authority is not allowed to investigate this."" Under Swedish law, news outlets are protected from police investigations into their sources. The news organization contacted the on-call prosecutor Friday night, the authority said. ""Once the on-call prosecutor was made aware that the news organization already knew all the details in the case, she confirmed that there was such a case ongoing and that it involved Julian Assange."" However, she provided no details to the media, the authority said. ""This is very important, especially in cases involving sex crimes, since information about the individuals involved must be protected. This is governed by Swedish privacy laws."" After the news broke in the media on Saturday, the on-call prosecutor ""came under intense pressure"" and it became clear the case needed to be transferred to someone else so that she could continue her usual duties, the prosecution authority said. Finne was then appointed lead investigator and immediately began looking into the case, the authority said. She made the decision Saturday to revoke the warrant ""because she did not consider it possible to suspect him of rape,"" the statement said. ""The amount of information available to her was more extensive than what the on-call prosecutor had on Friday evening. Exactly what that information was cannot be disclosed at this point, since the investigation is ongoing."" Assange said the on-call prosecutor should be criticized, as well as the media ""who so blindly reported these accusations."" Finne, however, said in a statement Monday, ""My decision that Mr. Assange should no longer be arrested in his absence because he could not be suspected of rape is by no means criticism of the decision of the duty prosecutor. I had access to more information on Saturday than the duty prosecutor had on Friday."" Assange told Aftonbladet that he was at a friend's cottage in northern Sweden and had initially planned to stay until Wednesday but was delaying his departure for reasons unrelated to the investigation. Swedish media, citing unnamed sources, reported that the two women reported the allegations to police, which led to the warrant. Aftonbladet said the older woman told the newspaper that the younger woman had approached her with a story similar to hers: that she had consensual sex with Assange but that the situation had turned abusive. Karin Rosander, spokeswoman for the prosecution authority, would not confirm those reports. Finne has ""still not decided what other potential offenses [Assange] may be suspected of in the incident previously labeled rape,"" the prosecution authority's statement said. ""She also has not yet decided on the suspected molestation. The investigation is still ongoing and the suspicions against Assange are still there."" Rosander said Monday that if Assange is convicted of molestation, he could face a sentence of up to a year in jail. Prosecutors may also request in court that he be held in jail while awaiting trial, she said. Rosander earlier had said he would not face jail time if convicted of molestation but corrected that Monday.

"New York (CNN) -- The last thing 18-year-old Mohamed Kamara from Sierra Leone expected was to be honored by the New York Yankees, but there he was, tossing out the first pitch at a Yankees-Detroit Tigers game last week. Kamara survived one of Africa's most brutal civil wars, nearly losing his life in his homeland. The Yankees celebrated Kamara's survival and community spirit here, where he has lived since coming from Sierra Leone, with the team's annual Project HOPE program. HOPE (Helping Others Persevere & Excel) recognizes people who have overcome their own personal challenges and who now inspire others by changing the community they live in. ""Today is going to be your day, where you're going to hang out with us on this Hope Week and we're going to make this day about you, because you make every day about everybody else,"" said Brian Chashman, general manager of the Yankees, as Kamara was being honored. Hanging out was an understatement, even by Yankee standards. Kamara got the shock of life when he walked into a room at the New York Stock Exchange and was greeted by Yankee brass and players, including star lefthander C.C. Sabathia along with Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson. He toured the trading floor and was awarded an internship for next year by the stock exchange. He didn't know it then, but his surprise itinerary would next include a chat with Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a visit to the United Nations to meet the ambassador from Sierre Leone and to stand on the rostrum of the General Assembly, plus that trip to Yankee Stadium to throw out the first pitch at the Yankee-Tigers contest Wednesday night. Kamara earned his special honors. He was forced to become the sole provider for his family at the age of 9. With his mother suddenly ill and an absentee father, Kamara took care of his four younger siblings. When a shaky ceasefire began in Sierre Leone,  Mohamed came to the U.S. a few years ago to live with an aunt and uncle in the Bronx and to pursue his hope that he could create a better life for himself and his family. He attended high school, starting without any English skills, and ended up graduating in the top quarter of his class. A high school mentor helped him get a job as a golf caddy, and he commutes by train for almost five hours a day to and from New Jersey for that job. Seventy percent of what he earns is sent back to his family. ""(I) get up every day at four o'clock in the morning to go to work. It was hard for me, but you know, I was determined to do it because I have a family to take care of and that was my main focus,"" Kamara said. He went on to earn a partial scholarship to Johnson & Wales University in Rhode Island, where he plans to major in business. Kamara recognizes the problems created by Wall Street but is not deterred; rather, he believes he has a role to play in its recovery. ""You know, it takes someone to fix it up, so hopefully one day I will be that person,"" Kamara said. Derek Jeter, captain of the Yankees, who met Kamara at the U.N., described him as ""a remarkable young man. He's come over to this country, goes to school, works to support his family, now he's headed off to college. We couldn't be more proud of him."" After his U.N. tour, Kamara said he hoped one day to return to Sierre Leone to help improve things there. ""We're  inspired by the younger generations, moving like this, and trying to rebrandish the country of Sierra Leone,"" said Ambassador Shekou Touray.. Kamara's friends also are inspired by the selflessness of his actions -- so inspired, they compare him to a president they greatly respect. ""One time he was standing for class president and people came out with, 'Mobama, Mobama!' We used to call him that,"" said Owusu Mensah, Kamara's closest friend.","Mohamed Kamara began taking care of his family in Sierra Leone when he was 9 .

"(CNN) -- Seven people, including six Israelis, are feared dead after an Israeli helicopter crashed in Romania on Monday during a joint military exercise, the Romanian Defense ministry said. The control center for the joint exercises, known as Blue Sky 2010, lost radio contact with the Israeli CH-53 helicopter about 3:20 p.m. (8:20 a.m. ET), the ministry said in a statement. Search-and-rescue operations began immediately, using a Romanian medical helicopter and two Israeli helicopters, the statement said. About 5:45 p.m. (10:45 a.m. ET), teams found the wreckage of the helicopter in the Fundata-Zarnesti area, near Brasov in central Romania, the defense ministry said. ""So far, the circumstances of the accident and the crew situation remain unknown."" Defense Minister Gabriel Oprea has ordered a commission to the site to investigate the crash, the ministry said. Israel Defense Forces said the aircraft was carrying four pilots, two mechanics and a member of the Romanian Air Force. The Israeli air force is sending medical, rescue and investigative teams to the scene, a military statement said. The crash site was in a remote area at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters (about 6,560 feet) in the mountains, according to the defense ministry. Fog was preventing helicopters from flying to the site Monday night. Authorities said six ambulances were waiting a few kilometers away. The exercises, scheduled from July 18 through Thursday, are aimed at training low-altitude aircraft crews in search-and-rescue operations and medical evacuations, according to the statement. A CH-53 helicopter made an emergency landing July 18 after experiencing technical problems, the defense ministry said. The problem was fixed, and it took off and landed safely.

"(CNN) -- Scuffles between Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi's presidential guard and Ugandan security personnel have twice broken out at the African Union summit on the shores of Lake Victoria, officials said. ""Fights are always a result of the lack of respect by the Libyans to their hosts,"" said Ejison Kwesiga, spokesman for Uganda's presidential brigade. ""Host authorities are responsible for any dangers that could arise. It is the host country's authorities who must take care of all visiting heads of state, but the Libyans never want them to do their job."" Libyan guards exchanged kicks and blows with Ugandan security on Sunday, the first day of the summit, as they approached the entrance marquee for the opening ceremony, according to journalist Samson Ntale. Only heads of state were allowed inside the ceremony. An argument erupted when Ugandan authorities attempted to escort Gadhafi through the entrance. ""It escalated into a physical fight, but no guns were drawn,"" Ntale said. On Monday, a similar situation occurred when Gadhafi and his security team were walking to the main conference hall. Heads of state were being moved to another room, and a scuffle broke out when Ugandan authorities attempted to escort Gadhafi there. Apparently annoyed the meeting was moved, Gadhafi slapped three of his own personnel, Ntale said. ""Gadhafi was irritated. I saw him slap his own men,"" he said. The Libyan security personnel declined comment.","Scuffles have broken out twice between Moammar Gadhafi's guards, security .

"New York (CNN) -- Film critic Roger Ebert and the founder of the website Chatroulette.com were among the honorees on Monday night at the 14th annual Webby Awards in downtown Manhattan. Ebert, who lost his ability to speak after a bout with cancer, was given the Person of the Year award for blogging and using social media tools to get his writing voice back. ""Twitter and the internet have allowed Roger to continue the work we came to know and love him for,"" said Jimmy Fallon, who presented Ebert's award. ""I can't remember the last time I went to see a movie without seeing what Roger Ebert thought of it first."" Chatroulette's founder, 17-year-old Andrey Ternovskiy, was given the ""Breakout of the Year"" award. Ternovskiy's website, which lets people chat face-to-face with strangers, has been praised by some for breaking down social and national cliques online. Others have called it a den for pornography. David-Michel Davies, executive director of the Webby Awards, said Chatroulette's story shows the equalizing power of the Web. ""I think it's incredible that this far into the Web, something can be created by a 17-year old kid in Russia and literally all of the major global media is talking about it three days later, "" he said. ""It really shows the kind of impact you can have on the internet."" Some of those who received Webby Awards expressed optimism about the future of the internet. ""You ain't seen nothing yet,"" Vinton Cerf, the man known as the ""godfather of the internet"" told a raucous crowd. Cerf, a co-inventor of the internet who is credited with writing the Web's original code, received a Lifetime Achievement Webby Award. ""The Webbies represent a kind of recognition that creativity isn't dead yet,"" Cerf said. In protest of the drawn-out acceptance speeches that are common at traditional award shows, Webby winners were told to keep their acceptance speeches short -- to a mere five words. ""Didn't kill the radio star,"" ¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠a Pandora Radio representative joked. Pandora, a website that streams music for free, took home the Best Music Webby. Some honorees used their five words to make political statements. ""I say plug the hole,"" actress Isabella Rosselini said, referring to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Rosselini was given the Best Individual Performance award for her online series, Green Porno, about the reproductive habits of marine animals.

"(CNN) -- Everyone from ""Twilight Moms"" to ""Family Guy"" fans is waiting in line at Comic-Con. This nearly 40-year-old convention is mainly devoted to comic books, and it was sold out before the exhibitors and speakers were even announced this year. Why are so many people there? In 2009, Diamond Comics, one of the world's largest comic book, graphic novel and merchandise distributors, sent out 79 million comic books and 15 million graphic novels to stores. It's not only geeky, teenage boys reading the comics. Buyers include include teenage girls, college students and professionals in their 40s, comic book store owners and industry experts say. Many people, including Mike Van Houten, started reading comic books as children. Van Houten, who has owned Oxford Comic Books in Atlanta, Georgia, for 30 years, still remembers the first comics he bought. ""I started collecting comic books when I was a little kid, maybe 12 years old. I went into an old-timey drug store -- it still had a counter that had a malt shop --and back in the back it had a rack of comics,"" he said. ""I remember buying three comics, all Marvel. ""Fantastic Four,"" ""Captain America,"" and ""Spiderman,"" and I fell in love with them."" But comic books weren't always designed to attract children's allowance dollars. American comics started out in the 1930s as a successful way to sell newspapers, said Mike Richardson, CEO of Dark Horse Comics. ""The Sunday paper was literally wrapped in funnies to get people to buy that newspaper as opposed to the competition,"" he said. ""The comic strips were so popular that two salesmen had the idea to repackage them."" After the success of Action Comics No.1, which was the first appearance of Superman -- and a failed comic strip, Richardson pointed out -- a flood of copycat superhero comic books appeared. ""For many years comics were taken as children's entertainment,"" Richardson said. ""But we've seen the graying of the comic book audience. Because we have an older clientele, the subject matter has matured. There was a poll done recently that said comic readers are more likely to be in their mid 20s than 12 or younger."" Even the art in comic books -- a major appeal of the medium -- is more mature, he said. Comic books also have seen a shift in storylines and characters. Shelley Loewnau, owner of Teahouse Comics in Sandy Springs, Georgia, said that more of today's comic books appeal to women. ""[Women comic book characters are] positive role models -- strong women, confident women, women with great careers,"" Loewnau said. ""Pepper Potts from 'Iron Man' is a great example of that. Tony Stark couldn't run the company without her. And then there's also the great clothing, the costumes. It's not just the woman in the bathing suit anymore."" ""[Artists] are crossing over,"" said Peter Bell, owner of Bell Book & Comic in Dayton, Ohio. ""Like Greg Rucka, who wrote mystery novels and crime novels. Now he's writing 'Batman.' That's perfect. You have a mystery writer writing about a great detective. It makes sense."" When a mainstream writer writes a comic book, people want to check it out, he said. In Japan, people have enjoyed comics since the time of Emperor Meji. These days, it is not uncommon to see businessmen, grandmothers and school children all reading comic books on subways and trains. Yoshimura Kazuma, the chief researcher of the Manga Museum in Kyoto, Japan, said the cartoon form is appealing because it offers a ""more unique expression than a movie or a novel."" The ""transformation, exaggeration and omissions"" that the images in comics make convey information on multiple levels, and is similar to the way Chinese writing is ideographic script, he said. (In Japanese kanji, for example, the idea or image of the word is often included in the shape of the word's symbol.) The equivalent of a comic book in Japan is called ""manga."" Manga is a mainstay of Japanese publishing, taking the form of magazines or even small paperback books. These printed cartoons follow a similar structure to American comic books, but have evolved to appeal to Japanese sensibilities and include a wide variety of topics. Manga can encompass just about any genre: science fiction, horror, fantasy, comedy, action, sports, fashion, geared toward young women or men, and even graphic and adult content in some cases. Hollywood likes comic books, too. In the past 10 years, the box office has been beholden to anything superhero. We've seen wildly successful franchises of Marvel's ""Iron Man,"" ""Spiderman,"" ""The X-Men,"" and D.C. Comic's ""Batman,"" and ""The Watchmen."" Dark Horse Comics has had success with the ""Hellboy"" franchise, ""300"" and ""Sin City"". Van Hauten points out that there are plenty of other movies based on comic books that aren't so overtly full of superheroes. ""It's astounding, even a movie like Tom Hanks' ""Road to Perdition"" was a comic graphic novel. Another one is ""American Splendor,"" Harvey Pekar's graphic novel. They're all over the map."" So how does a fan of these movies take the next step and follow their favorite characters on other adventures? Comic books are a great option, said Bell. There's even a phone number to call -- 888-COMIC-BOOK -- to find out the comic shop closest to you. Not to worry, said Bell, it probably won't be like the comic book guy's store from ""The Simpsons."" ""It's like Cheers in here,"" said Bell of his store. ""It's some place people can come to and hang out and talk about [their favorite comics]. Things they can't get to at home or at work,"" he said. ""The community is growing. A lot of people don't want to admit they like comics."" But Bell said not to hide your pride, because you might be surprised who else reads your favorite title.","Almost 100 million comic books and graphic novels were distributed last year .
The average comic book buyer is no longer a teenage boy .
Manga is a mainstay of the Japanese publishing industry .
Hollywood has had great popular success with movies adapted from comic books ."
"(CNN) -- A 15-year-old girl died and two other people were hospitalized with severe injuries after an amusement park ride in Barcelona, Spain, broke in midair, a city spokeswoman said. A young boy who was on the ride suffered minor injuries, but walked away from the twisted metal on his own, Barcelona spokeswoman Rosa Diaz said. The names of the victims have not been announced. The mechanical arm of ""El Pendulo"" (The Pendulum) broke and the basket carrying the teens fell on top of the ride known as ""The Golden Mine,"" said Sara Jaurriete, director of the Tibidabo amusement park. The park's website describes El Pendulo as ""the ultimate free fall and the first of its kind in Spain."" The ride has a ""long articulated arm where passengers are taken up to 38 meters (124 ft). From here, you are dropped in a free fall reaching 100kph (60 mph) in 2.8 seconds. Once you reach the bottom, the arm takes you through a 50-metre arc,"" the park's website says. The Pendulum has been in operation for the past four years, and it is billed as one of the park's main attractions. About 4,000 visitors were in the park when the accident happened Saturday evening, Jaurriete said. The park will be closed on Sunday as an investigation begins.","A ride basket breaks in midair, falling onto another ride .

"(CNN) -- Since Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed Senate Bill 1070 into law in late April, there has been a wide array of opinions about the controversial immigration law, which takes effect Thursday. Here's a look at some of those viewpoints: . Immigration reform: Start with small steps: John D. Skrentny, director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at U.C. San Diego, says: ""Like the characters in 'Hot Tub Time Machine,' reformers are stuck in 1986.""   Arizona should kill immigration bill: Every movement needs heroes. The fight against discrimination in Arizona just got nine, writes Stephen Lemons, a blogger and columnist with the Phoenix New Times. Arizona had to take charge on immigration: Republican Russ Jones is an Arizona state representative from the 24th District in Yuma, and he voted for SB 1070: ""Some people criticize this new bill, while at the same time saying that something must be done about illegal immigration. Then they will mention the ever-popular catchphrase about ""comprehensive immigration policy."" This is fine and good, but so far no one on either the state or federal level has enacted any workable solutions to this problem. ... With a lack of progress, this state has felt compelled to move forward in crafting its own legislation to deal with problems at home."" Undocumented workers need legal rights: Richard Trumka is president of the AFL-CIO and former president of the United Mine Workers of America.  He believes that the United States ""cannot afford to have millions of hard-working people without legal protections, shut off from economic gain. But the way we treat the immigrants among us is about more than economic strategy: It is about who we are as a nation."" Law meant to provoke government action: Michael Hethmon is a public interest lawyer and general counsel for the Immigration Reform Law Institute, the legal affiliate of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. He helped draft SB 1070, the Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act.  Hethmon argues that the controversial law ""was intended by its creators, myself among them, to provoke sustainable immigration reform."" How Obama can lead on immigration: Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a nationally syndicated columnist, an NPR commentator and a regular contributor to CNN.com.  He argues that ""it doesn't make any political sense for President Obama to talk about the need to reform our immigration system."" Did Obama break his promise to Latinos? In this piece, Navarrette says Obama stands to lose the support of Latino voters by failing to uphold his promise on comprehensive immigration reform in his first year. Can Obama close the divide on immigration? Tamar Jacoby is president of ImmigrationWorks USA, a national federation of small-business owners advocating immigration reform.  She addresses the differing opinions among Americans about immigration reform, and suggests ways Obama can address that paradox.","Immigration studies center director says that ""reformers are stuck in 1986""

"(CNN) -- Three teens who were on a 69-name hit list posted on Facebook have been killed in the past 10 days in a southwestern Colombian town, officials say. Police say they do not know who posted the list or why the names are on it. ""It is still not clear,"" Colombian national police spokesman Wilson Baquero told CNN. ""This is part of the investigation."" But officials note that a criminal gang known as Los Rastrojos and a Marxist guerrilla group called the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia operate in the area. The hit list on Facebook, which was posted August 17, gave the people named three days to leave the town of Puerto Asis or be executed, said Volmar Perez Ortiz, a federal official whose title is defender of the public. Police at first thought the posting was a joke, Perez said in a statement issued Saturday. But the publication of a second list with 31 additional names led authorities to convene a special security meeting Friday, Perez said. The posting of the lists and the meetings occurred after the first two killings, which took place August 15, Perez said. On that day, officials say, 16-year-old student Diego Ferney Jaramillo and 17-year-old CD retailer Eibart Alejandro Ruiz Munoz were shot and killed while riding a motorcycle on the road between Puerto Asis and the town of Puerto Caicedo. Both their names were later found on the first published hit list. Also on the list was Norbey Alexander Vargas, 19, who was killed August 20, Perez said. Another young man, 16-year-old student Juan Pablo Zambrano Anacona, was wounded in the same incident when he gave chase to the assassins, Perez said. Colombian media said Monday the number of those threatened has grown and panic has overtaken Puerto Asis, with some parents sending their children out of town because their names are on the Facebook notice. The names of 31 women were posted on the other list, said Radio RCN, semana.com and other news outlets. Residents have been overcome with ""panic and anxiety,"" several news outlets quoted Putumayo state official Andres Gerardo Verdugo as saying. Several of those residents posted their concerns on Twitter, an online messaging site. ""Panic in Puerto Asis, Putumayo, because of threats against young people,"" wrote a user who goes by JuanSepulvedah. ""Our youth must be protected."" Someone who posted under the name JulianEco brought up the Facebook connection. ""The situation in Puerto Asis is tenacious, that a social site be used to add fire to the Colombian conflict,"" the post said. Twitter user hugoparragomez likened the situation to the drug-fueled crime waves in other Colombian cities. ""What is happening in Puerto Asis, Putumayo, is grave, the same as in Medellin,"" the tweet said. ""Authorities should take control of the situation. Who is investigating?"" Still others inflated the death count. ""In Puerto Asis they have killed 20 young people threatened on Facebook and the authorities have not said anything,"" wrote jesusmhenriquez ""That is Colombia."" Federal officials say they are taking the threats seriously and have sent investigators from Bogota, the nation's capital, to Puerto Asis. Internet experts are among the investigators assigned to the case. Authorities also are offering a reward of 5 million pesos (around $2,750) for information on the killings. Perez, the federal defender of the public, noted that the Los Rastrojos criminal gang is active in Puerto Asis, ""executing violent actions, resolving community conflicts, imposing living and conduct norms, intimidating and meting punishment against ... drug sellers and consumers, sex workers, people with criminal and unlawful histories and threatening social leaders, business people, taxi drivers and motorcycle taxi drivers."" Perez said the Marxist guerrillas, commonly known as the FARC, also are active in the remote area, which borders Ecuador. Two Facebook representatives did not return a message Tuesday asking for comment.","The first list posted on Facebook had 69 names, officials say .
Another posting this week added 31 names, news reports said.

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot told investigators during an interrogation that he knows the location of Natalee Holloway's body, but he would neither identify the location nor say what happened to her the night of her disappearance, a Peruvian police official told said Thursday in Lima, Peru. ""He says he knew the location of the American citizen but that he was going to explain everything to Aruban police,"" said Miguel Canlla, head of the homicide division of the Peruvian national police investigative unit. Van der Sloot, a 22-year-old Dutch citizen, is suspected of killing a 21-year-old woman in Lima last month. Stephany Flores Ramirez was found beaten to death in a hotel room registered in van der Sloot's name. Van der Sloot was captured in Chile and returned last week to Peru, where authorities say he confessed to killing Flores. He was twice arrested in connection with the 2005 disappearance of Holloway, who was on a class trip to Aruba, but was released for lack of evidence. This week U.S. authorities filed extortion and wire fraud charges against the Dutchman. An Interpol document says van der Sloot faces criminal charges in Alabama because he allegedly tried to extort money from Holloway's mother. A federal law enforcement agent told CNN that a representative for Natalee Holloway's mother who paid $25,000 for information on the whereabouts of her daughter's remains last month was an undercover FBI agent. Van der Sloot said he would reveal the location of the body and the circumstances surrounding her death for $25,000 in cash and asked for $250,000 in total, the document states. The FBI and U.S. Attorney's office in Birmingham arranged for a meeting where van der Sloot was paid $10,000 in cash and another $15,000 in a wire transfer for information van der Sloot allegedly promised would lead to Holloway's body in Aruba, a source familiar with the case said. The meeting took place last month, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Birmingham. Interpol documents show that the $15,000 was transferred to a personal bank account in the Netherlands. It's unclear whether that money paid for van der Sloot's trip to Colombia and to Peru. In exchange for the money, van der Sloot showed the representative a house where supposedly Holloway's remains were, according to the document. When records showed that the house had not yet been built at the time of her disappearance, van der Sloot admitted that he lied, Interpol said.","Homicide chief: van der Sloot says he'll ""explain everything to Aruban police""

"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN)  -- Opponents of an Islamic community center and mosque planned to be built near ground zero say it would desecrate hallowed ground. But suspicion has greeted proposed mosque projects in places less hallowed than ground zero -- in Murfreesboro, Tennessee; Sheboygan, Wisconsin; Temecula, California; and elsewhere. This suggests that opposition to mosques is not driven only by sensitivity to the memory of terrorism victims, but also by a growing unease toward Islam, fueled by security fears. Opposition to Islamic centers and mosques in the United States shows remarkable similarities to anti-Islamic movements in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, where people also have sought to prohibit new mosques. Last December in Switzerland, citizens voted in a referendum to prohibit new minarets. Another trait shared by anti-Islamic movements on both sides of the Atlantic is that they increasingly justify their opposition by arguing that Islam is not a religion. For example, in his campaign preceding Holland's recent elections, extreme right-wing parliamentarian Geert Wilders repeatedly argued that Islam is a political ideology. Tennessee Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey, in his failed gubernatorial bid, suggested that the freedom of religion enshrined in the First Amendment might not apply to Muslims. ""You could even argue whether being a Muslim is actually a religion, or is it a nationality, way of life, a cult,"" the Republican candidate told an audience in Murfreesboro. Disturbingly, these assertions are often embraced by people looking to justify their intolerance. Counterclaims and evidence from religious leaders, intellectuals, government officials and others have little impact on this misperception. Why is Islam no longer considered a religion? American and European debate on Islam often revolves around the question of whether Islam is compatible with Western-style democracy and values. But because many Westerners associate Islam with al Qaeda, Palestinian militant groups and Iranian theocracy, they have a constricted, one-dimensional view of a faith that is multifaceted and complex. No doubt, some political groups are at war with certain Muslim regimes like those in Saudi Arabia, Egypt or Pakistan, and with the West. But some Westerners see the threat from terrorists who are driven by ideology and politics as a threat from a culture and religion. Those people who were already suspicious of  Islam can justify their hostility because, instead of a religion, Islam is considered an ideology emanating from Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Turkey and the rest of the Muslim world to threaten the West. It's worth noting that we did not seek to explain the violence and terrorism of Northern Ireland through the lens of Catholicism and Protestantism only; nobody scoured the Bible for verses about violence and war. Observers, instead, cited political, economic and historic factors to explain the conflict. By the same token, no one would argue that Gush Emunim, or Block of the Faithful, exclusively represents Judaism, or that the murder of abortion doctors represents the essence of Christianity. But when it comes to Islam, ignoring important economic, historical and political factors has become perfectly acceptable. Politicians, pundits and ordinary Americans see Islam -- not political groups using Islamic rhetoric --  as an existential threat to Western secular norms. So, they believe, restraining it justifies extraordinary measures, even those that violate American  values and the Constitution -- such as trying to ban mosques. How did this collusion between politics and culture happen? It would be misleading to think that this perception is new. It has existed since Colonial times at least, and remains prevalent because it taps into images and memories intrinsic to the historical consciousness of Western politicians and intellectuals. Scholarly literature often echoes stereotypical images of Islam and Muslims, such as women in burqas or bearded fanatics with bulging eyes shouting slogans. In some cases,  headlines come directly from titles in academic journals and books: ""The Muslims Are Coming! The Muslims Are Coming!"" (Pipes, 1990), ""The Roots of Muslim Rage"" (Lewis, 1990), ""Terror, Islam, and Democracy"" (Boroumand and Boroumand, 2002), ""The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror"" (Lewis, 2003) or ""Onward Muslim Soldiers: How Jihad Still Threatens America and the West"" (Spencer, 2002). When Europeans were building new political principles based on the sovereignty of the people, they defined them in opposition to their most powerful political neighbor of the time: the Ottoman Empire. ""Oriental societies"" were represented as simply the negative counterpart of Western societies. Islam and Muslims became the typical ""Other."" We seem to need to exist in opposition to an Other, and in today's national folklore, Islam plays that role. Not surprisingly, contemporary political Muslim groups across the globe play the same game, manufacturing their legitimacy as a product of opposition to their own Other, the West. It is impossible for societies to completely rid themselves of this polarizing rhetoric. That said, societies differ in the degree to which their political imaginations are subjected to open critical discussion. It is the strength of democracy in the U.S. that such debates can exist, so demonization of the Other won't ride roughshod over reason. Muslims have a crucial role to play in these debates. Most Muslims in Europe, the United States and even in parts of the Islamic world view the presence of Islam in the West  as a chance to overcome such polarization. Prohibiting mosques doesn't advance these society-saving debates, and can't reshape our imaginations so that we can one day imagine Islam and Muslims as fellow citizens. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jocelyne Cesari.","Jocelyne Cesari: Opposition to mosques shows a growing unease and fear of Islam .

"(CNN) -- After four years and more than $100 million spent by the international community, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal rendered its first verdict Monday. Kaing Guek Eav, better known as Duch, was found guilty of war crimes and sentenced to serve up to 19 more years in prison in what was an open-and-shut case. From the start, Duch, a born-again Christian, fully admitted his leadership role in Phnom Penh's infamous Tuol Sleng, a school-turned-torture center, where more than 14,000 people were killed. On this momentous occasion, I'd like to step back by reflecting upon and give voice to one victim of the Khmer Rouge: my late mother, Cam Youk Lim. My mom passed away in October at the age of 73 in Northern California. When she was only 39, she had managed to outwit the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese communists by escaping Cambodia to Vietnam with five young children, including me. She didn't live to see this day, but no matter, for her justice would inevitably be rendered the Buddhist way. She decided long ago the Khmer Rouge were Karmic pestilence who would pay the price for their crimes, if not in this lifetime, then in their next life. She was an incredible woman. She grew up in an age and place when women were the property of men, and yet she sought independence. On her home was a sign ""Propri√©t√© de Madame Lim"" (Property of Mrs. Lim). She married my father in the 1960s and on April 17, 1975, we ended up in Pursat province, where my father was made to work until he died. One day, the Khmer Rouge chief told the village that Vietnamese citizens would be allowed to return to Vietnam. She decided to take a chance and claim to be Vietnamese. It was a dangerous gamble. If it turned out that she was wrong, she would certainly have been killed. People in the commune warned her it might be a trap. ''Auntie, they're lying, they'll kill you when you go back there,'' they said. ''To stay is to die, to go is to die, so I might as well go,'' she told them. As she arrived in the camp on the Cambodian border with Vietnam, she discovered that she'd given all the boys girls' names and all the girls boys' names. Her spoken Vietnamese was that bad. But because of the kindness of a stranger, Mrs. Teuv, who pointed this out to her and then tutored her for the next couple of days, her Vietnamese improved so much that she passed the language test that the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese cadres gave her. Remember, if she failed, we would all be dead. Imagine the courage it took for her to stand there and pretend to be someone she was not: Vietnamese. On the day of the interview, she wrapped us in blankets and made us pretend to be sick so we would not be questioned. The Vietnamese cadre asked her: ''Sister what is your name?'' She answered in her best Saigon accent: . ''My name is Nguyen Thi Lan,'' a name she'd given herself. They kept asking whether my father, who had owned a small drugstore, had been a big shot. She stuck to her story. ''No, he was a trader, that's all.'' Read more about Sophal Ear and his family's journey . When at last she received permission to leave Cambodia, she was so happy. This chance to leave was like being reborn with all of her children. On the boat to Vietnam, she was given rice and canned milk for me, as the baby. Without even warming it up, she fed it to me until I became bloated and sick. My sister Sophie cried: ''I want noodles! I want noodles!'' Mom had no money, so she sold her last ring and bought a pot and some three-layered pork fat to make our first real meal in six months. It was her determination that allowed us to survive, for even after reaching Vietnam's Mekong Delta, we were not out of the woods. Vietnamese authorities told us to find family or we'd be taken to a collective farm, which wasn't much better than living under the Khmer Rouge. As luck would have it, mom bumped into someone who knew her sister and brother-in-law, who lived in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). She asked that word be sent, and soon after, on a boat down the Mekong, her brother-in-law came to the rescue. He bribed guards to let us out in the middle of the night and in January 1976, we were finally safe. Over the next two years, mom somehow managed to survive by her wits and the money another sister who lived in California sent her. The next challenge was how to get out of communist Vietnam. Without diplomatic relations, the U.S. was impossible to reach after the Vietnam War, but France was an option. Getting to France in 1978 took a lot of work. For one thing, mom had no direct family there, and someone with the same last name had to be found and persuaded to sign papers claiming a family relationship. After signing the papers, they got lost in the mail. There again, a random person helped. A Frenchman forged signatures, cajoled and yelled at staff in a French government offices. He once demanded they reopen because, by his watch, it wasn't yet closing time. In France, mom worked hard to sew fancy tablecloths and napkins with embroidered flowers. In 1985, she packed up her bags again and took her three youngest kids (Sam, Sophie and I were minors) to start a new life in the United States. She worked as a seamstress in the garment factories of Oakland's Chinatown, making wedding gowns that had labels we'd never heard of, much less could afford. She used those same skills to make Sophie clothes that were just as good and custom-made. All through this time, she pressed us to study in school and to go on to college. She was not interested in a life of quick riches. Cutting school short to work was out of the question. She believed in education, and for her, education was not only about making money, it was about learning how to think. All this was from a woman who had seven years of formal schooling. Somehow, she didn't need any more to know that our responsibility was to get an education. And we did. Sam graduated from San Francisco State University and now works as a software engineer. Sophie finished UC San Francisco as a pharmacist. I received my UC Berkeley PhD and became a professor. The Talmud says that if you save a life, you save the world. The Chinese have another proverb: ""When you save a life, you are responsible for that life."" My mom saved six lives from the Killing Fields, and with 14 grandkids and counting, she has saved 20 lives to date. I say counting because two days ago, I learned that my wife is expecting our second child. Thanks, mom, for helping to bring new hope into this world.

"(CNN) -- A man suspected in the deaths of three people in Panama is now wanted in the slaying of an American woman whose body was found last week, Panama's national police said Saturday. The body of Cher Hughes, a native of suburban St. Louis, Missouri, was found Tuesday on the property of William Adolfo Cortez Reese, who is suspected in her death, said Javier Carrillo, director of the national police investigation unit. Carrillo said Cortez and his wife, Jane, are on the run. Cortez ""may be from Holland. We're not sure that's his real identity,"" he said. ""We found a false passport."" He said Panamanian authorities are attempting to reach police in Holland. Hughes, who was in her early 50s, was identified by her husband, Keith Werle, who lives in Panama. A second body -- which has not yet been officially identified -- was found near Hughes. ""We believe the motive is that he (William Cortez) is killing people to take their property,"" Carrillo said. He added that authorities do not know Cortez's whereabouts, and have not received any tips from the public. Werle said he was on Cortez's property, a massive piece of farmland on the island of Isla Colon in the western province of Boca del Toro, as police executed a search warrant. He said his dog led authorities to a shallow grave, where they found Hughes' body. Dwayne Cooney, a family friend, said Hughes had lived in Panama for the past decade and owned a hotel, the Casa del Sapo, in Boca del Torro. He described Hughes and Cortez as friends and neighbors. Hughes had lived in St. Petersburg, Florida, where she owned a neon sign business, before moving to Panama, Cooney said.

"(CNN) -- The number of U.S. troops in Iraq has fallen below 50,000 -- the lowest level since the U.S-led invasion in 2003, the military said Tuesday. The drop comes ahead of President Barack Obama's deadline to bring down troop levels by August 31. The military said U.S. troops will now transition to Operation New Dawn, effective September 1. In this phase, the United States will help train Iraqi security forces until the end of its mission in December 2011. While the total number of U.S. troops in Iraq will continue to diminish throughout 2011, the withdrawal rate will be ""calibrated and adjusted based on conditions on the ground,"" according to presidential national security adviser John Brennan. On Monday, Vice President Joe Biden said that the overall level of violence in Iraq has now declined to the point that some early U.S. veterans of the conflict ""would not recognize"" the country today. The roughly 650,000-member Iraq security force is ""already leading the way to defend and protect [the] country,"" he said. ""Some said that our drawdown would bring about more violence. Well, they were wrong,"" Biden said at a gathering of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Indianapolis, Indiana. Iraqi officials, however, have noted a recent campaign of bombings and shootings in Baghdad, where gunmen have attacked traffic police and checkpoints, killing Iraqi troops. Many Iraqis have blamed the recent violence on the current political paralysis, in which quarreling parties have failed to form a government nearly six months after parliamentary elections. The Iraqi government had been pushing to increase security ahead of the U.S. drawdown. Biden stressed that the changing U.S. role in Iraq should be not be viewed as American disengagement. He noted that the administration is largely following former President George W. Bush's plan for a ""long-term"" relationship with Baghdad. Civilian efforts to promote Iraqi stability are ramping up, Biden said. But Obama is planning a speech on the situation in Iraq after he returns to Washington from vacation on August 29, a senior administration source said Sunday.","NEW: U.S. troop withdrawal rates will depend on ground conditions, Brennan says .

"(CNN) -- RadarOnline released another audio recording Tuesday of a vicious argument allegedly between actor Mel Gibson and his ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva, in which the man is accused of striking the woman and the couple's child -- an accusation the man does not deny. The website has been releasing similarly explosive recordings since July 9. It has not disclosed how it obtained the audio. The recordings are taken from a phone call and capture an obscenity-laced rant by the man as he spews racial and ethnic slurs, sexual insults and death threats. The site claims the male voice is that of the 54-year-old Gibson. CNN has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the recordings. In the recording released Tuesday, the woman tells the man he needs to seek help for his current mental state, referencing an earlier altercation between them while she was holding their child in her arms. ""You're acting as a crazy man right now and you have been for many, many months,"" the woman says. ""And you hit me, and you hit her while she was in my hands! Mel, you're losing your mind. You need medication."" The man responds with a slew of obscenities, and ends the rant by saying, ""I want my child, and no one will believe you."" Grigorieva, 40, has acknowledged that the female voice on the recordings is hers and that the other voice is Gibson's. CNN's efforts to obtain comment from Gibson have been unsuccessful. The couple have been locked in a custody dispute over their 8-month-old daughter. The Malibu Hills Police Department opened an investigation earlier this month into an alleged domestic violence dispute between Gibson and Grigorieva. Grigorieva filed a restraining order against Gibson alleging that he struck her in the face, according to her spokesman, Stephen Jaffe. The recordings ""will be part of the investigation,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said last week. It is not known how RadarOnline obtained the recordings. Jaffe has said that the site did not receive them from Grigorieva. Gibson came under fire in 2006 when he admitted to making anti-Semitic remarks during a drunken driving arrest. He issued an apology at the time, and appealed to the Jewish community to help him recover from his alcohol addiction.","The recording allegedly captures an argument between the actor and his ex-girlfriend .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- The death toll from the devastating mudslide in China's northwestern Gansu province rose slightly to 1,254 Monday, a day after the country paused for three minutes in memory of those who perished. Another 490 people are still missing a week after torrential rains triggered the mudslides on July 8, the state-run Xinhua news agency said. At 10 a.m. Sunday, Chinese President Hu Jintao and other top leaders paid a silent tribute ahead of a party meeting. At the Dongjie Village in hardest-hit Zhouqu county, more than 5,000 rescuers and villagers stood still atop mudslide debris with their heads bowed, Xinhua said. Large-scale national displays of mourning are rare in China, though the country designated three days of mourning after a massive 2008 earthquake in Sichuan. The country also had a day of mourning after a quake in Yushu earlier this year. China has been drenched by heavy rains and floods since the end of May. More than 400 million people have been affected. On July 8, heavy rains caused the side of a mountain broke off in the night and tear through remote Zhouqu county, burying some homes and ripping others apart. The path of the mudslide is covered in three to four stories of rock and mud. By Sunday, crews had cleared out roads, allowing for the delivery of relief supplies. Power has been restored to about 76 percent of homes, and wells have been dug to supply more water, Xinhua said.","NEW: The death toll rises slightly to 1,254, with 490 missing .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Oil left on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico is breaking down naturally now that the flow of crude has been cut off beneath the surface, a Coast Guard admiral said Sunday after touring the scene. Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft said the remnants of Tropical Storm Bonnie did little to affect the oil slick, which is breaking down ""very quickly."" ""The storm itself was not that significant,"" Zukunft told CNN after an aerial survey of the northern Gulf on Sunday. ""We've had nine days of no new oil being released, so what we're seeing is the remnants of oil that was released nine days ago."" BP crews managed to temporarily cap the undersea well at the heart of the three-month-old disaster on June 15. But efforts to close off the gusher permanently by drilling a relief well were delayed by the storm, which forced the ships involved in the process to evacuate the area. Those ships have returned to the area since the storm, he told reporters Sunday night. Zukunft told reporters that he saw only one large patch of emulsified oil, about 12 miles off Grand Isle, Louisiana, during his six-hour aerial tour. No oil could be seen in Louisiana's Lake Borgne, Lake Pontchartrain or Chandeleur Sound, while only a light sheen was visible in other parts of the Gulf. ""The oil is basically approaching the end of its life cycle,"" he said. Oil had gushed from the ruptured well for nearly three months after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20, leaving 11 workers dead. Officials have said a relief well is the only permanent solution to the disaster, which saw as much as 60,000 barrels (2.5 million gallons) of crude spewing into the Gulf every day. Ships critical for drilling the well started evacuating Thursday and returning Saturday afternoon, once Bonnie lost her punch after crossing southern Florida. The weather forced officials to temporarily scale back efforts to search beneath the surface for leaking oil and permanently plug the leak, drawing some criticism from local officials that the federal government was overreacting to the storm. But retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who is leading the federal government's response to the spill, emphasized the need to move and protect equipment before a storm. He said told reporters Friday that he was still ""haunted"" by the sight of submerged school buses ""that could not be used for the evacuation"" after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in 2005. ""We're going to be playing a cat-and-mouse game for the remainder of the hurricane season,"" Allen said. Sunday, Allen said officials were examining new oil deposits on the shoreline created by the storm, and booms that were in sensitive marsh areas caused damage during the storm and may need to be removed before another surge happens. But with the storm's passing, work on the relief well is scheduled to continue, he said. And by August 1, he said crews could begin pumping drilling ""mud"" into the ruptured well to force oil back into the reservoir below -- a process known as a ""static kill.""

"New York (CNN) -- Two U.S. senators ratcheted up the pressure on BP and British government officials Monday to provide answers to the questions now swirling around the release of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, the Libyan man convicted in the 1988 bombing of Pam Am Flight 103, which killed 270 people. Obama administration officials, meanwhile, took what was described as an ""exceptional step"" to make clear that they had strongly opposed al Megrahi's release. A group of senators from New York and New Jersey have repeatedly voiced suspicions that Scottish authorities released al Megrahi as part of a deal allowing oil giant BP to drill off the Libyan coast. BP, a British corporation, is already dealing with a public relations nightmare as the company responsible for the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, is set to lead a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Thursday on the controversy surrounding al Megrahi's release. Several British officials have declined invitations to testify. ""The abundance of incredible coincidences"" surrounding al Megrahi's release demands transparency, Menendez said Monday. ""A cloud of suspicion"" will hang over the issue until all of the relevant questions have been answered. Menendez accused the Scottish and British governments of trying to point the finger of blame at each other in the decision to release al Megrahi. They're ""playing a game of diplomatic tennis worthy of Wimbledon,"" he said. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, said she is concerned that the release was ""an example of profits being put above people."" The senators need to know if ""blood was given for money,"" she said. ""We need to know that justice was served in this case."" The two senators were joined by relatives of three of the victims of the bombing. ""The increasing silence"" of authorities in London and Edinburgh leads me to ""think one thing: They're guilty of something,"" said Eileen Walsh, who lost her father, brother and sister. Menendez and Gillibrand were part of a group of four senators who met for 45 minutes last week with Prime Minister David Cameron, asking the British leader for an independent investigation into the release of al Megrahi and any possible involvement BP might have had. Sens. Charles Schumer of New York and Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey also attended. Most of the bombing victims were Americans. The flight was headed from Frankfurt, West Germany, to New York via London, England, when it exploded in the air. Al Megrahi was convicted in the case and sentenced to life in prison. The Scottish government released him on compassionate grounds in August after doctors said he had terminal prostate cancer and just three months to live. Al Megrahi is still alive, however, and news reports in recent days have questioned whether he was as sick as depicted. Under the Scotland Act 1998, Scotland has its own government that is responsible for most of the day-to-day issues there, including the justice system. Menendez has invited Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill, who made the decision to release al Megrahi, to testify before the Foreign Relations Committee. Andrew Fraser, the physician who gave the prognosis that led to al Megrahi's release, and former British Justice Secretary Jack Straw also have been asked to attend. All have declined. In an effort to make clear that the Obama White House had opposed the release al Megrahi, the State Department on Monday released the text of an August 12, 2009, letter sent from Richard LeBaron, the number two official at the U.S. Embassy in Britain, to Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. The letter stated that the U.S. government ""maintains its view that in light of the scope of Megrahi's crime, its heinous nature, and its continued and devastating impact on the victims and their families, it would be most appropriate for Megrahi to remain imprisoned for the entirety of his sentence."" If al Megrahi were released from prison, the United States would strongly oppose allowing him ""to travel outside of Scotland,"" LeBaron wrote.  ""We believe that the welcoming reception that Megrahi might receive if he is permitted to travel abroad would be extremely inappropriate."" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Monday that the administration was trying to ""avoid the worst possible outcome -- a hero's welcome for Megrahi in Libya. ... Unfortunately, the Scottish government did not heed those views.  Scottish authorities instead took two steps we explicitly asked them to avoid: they released Megrahi and they permitted his return to Libya."" At a joint news conference last week, Cameron and U.S. President Barack Obama blasted the Scottish decision. Cameron promised that the British government will cooperate with the U.S. congressional investigation into the controversy, though he stressed that the decision to release al Megrahi was made by the Scottish government, without any involvement from BP. Obama said that most Americans were ""surprised, disappointed and angry"" about the decision to let al Megrahi go. BP has said it expressed concern to the British government in late 2007 about the slow progress of a prisoner transfer agreement that Britain and Libya were negotiating, saying it could have had a ""negative impact"" on British commercial interests. But the company has denied involvement in any talks with either the British or Scottish governments specifically about al Megrahi's release.","NEW: State Department releases August 2009 letter opposing al Megrahi release .

"(CNN) -- A former Army lieutenant who was discharged from service last week for being openly gay said Sunday that he will continue to fight for a quick repeal of the controversial ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. ""I know that there are a lot of people who are suffering, and my oath, my commitment to them, doesn't end,"" former Lt. Dan Choi told CNN's Don Lemon. Choi was arrested in March for handcuffing himself to a White House fence in protest of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, which bars people who are openly gay or lesbian from serving in the military. He admitted his sexual orientation publicly for the first time last year on MSNBC's ""The Rachel Maddow Show,"" prompting the Army to initiate proceedings to discharge him. Choi said that while his honorable discharge hurts, he knows there is a ""greater purpose for every single one of us, even if we're stripped of all our wealth or our resources."" ""One thing about honor, one thing about dignity -- it's not dependent on what's written on a document,"" he said. ""That comes from standing up and being truthful to who you are."" He also vowed to ""continue to speak up for those people who cannot."" ""I'm going to continue to pressure those who purport to be our friends -- whether they're congressmen, senators or the president himself. If they make a promise, I will hold them to it.""

A bill that would overturn the measure after a Pentagon review is completed in December is currently before Congress. More than 12,500 gays have been booted from the military since ""don't ask, don't tell"" went into effect.

"(CNN) -- Judges have approved British supermodel Naomi Campbell's request to postpone her testimony at the ""blood diamonds"" war crimes trial for a former Liberian president, court officials said Monday. Campbell was scheduled to appear July 29 at the trial in The Hague, Netherlands, but will now appear on August 5 instead. Campbell did not want to be involved in the trial but was subpoenaed on July 1 to appear at the tribunal for Charles Taylor, who faces war crimes charges over a brutal conflict in Sierra Leone that was fueled by rough diamonds, also known as blood diamonds or conflict diamonds. Witnesses have said Taylor gave Campbell a diamond. Prosecutors had rested their case against Taylor in February 2009. They asked to reopen it specifically to call Campbell, as well as actress Mia Farrow and a witness named Carole Taylor, court papers show. Prosecutors said they learned in June 2009 that Taylor had given the supermodel a diamond in South Africa in 1997. Farrow confirmed it, they said. When arguing to reopen the case, prosecutors said Campbell's testimony would prove that the former president ""used rough diamonds for personal enrichment and arms purchases,"" according to papers filed with the U.N.-backed court. Taylor, 62, was president of Liberia from 1997 to 2003. The war crimes charges against him stem from the widespread murder, rape and mutilation that occurred during the bloody civil war in Sierra Leone. It was fought largely by teenagers who were forced to kill, given addictive drugs to provoke violent behavior, and often instructed to rape and plunder. Taylor is charged with five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, sexual slavery and violence, and enslavement. He also faces five counts of war crimes, including acts of terrorism and torture, and one count of other serious violations of international humanitarian law. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.","Supermodel Naomi Campbell requested the delay in testimony from July 29 to August 5 .

"(CNN) -- I don't care much for Sarah Palin's politics, but I do like her word ""refudiate.""  As I just typed the word, a squiggly red line appeared under it with a suggestion that I change the word to repudiate. Well, for the record, I repudiate that suggestion and refudiate it. People who don't like political figures often make fun of their language. H.L. Mencken said of a Warren G. Harding speech: ""It is rumble and bumble. It is flap and doodle. It is balder and dash."" Jimmy Carter's enemies portrayed him as a hick from the sticks, not just because of his brother Billy, but for his Southern speech, including his pronunciation of nuclear. It doesn't seem to matter whether you have a reputation as brainy and articulate. John Kennedy's Harvard dialect created a cottage industry of comic impressionists.  At the other end of the spectrum was George W. Bush, whose Bushisms were legion. Opponents of President Obama attack his use of language as elitist, professorial or passionless. In other words, Palin stands in good company. And I stand with her. What was her crime? She made up a new word --unintentionally perhaps, but it doesn't matter. I once referred to a highly paid athlete as a godzillionaire. I meant to say gazillionaire, but when I caught myself, I realized my ""mistake"" was better: the athlete's wealth was ginormous, as big and monstrous as the Japanese icon Godzilla. I'm all for coining neologisms, the technical name for a new word minted into the English language. One type of neologism is called a blend, as when two words are joined to form a third. The words web and log gave birth to blog. The merger of gigantic and enormous gave us the increasingly popular ginormous, which I thought was a kid's malapropism until I read it on a billboard. There's a chance that Palin, who compared her language creativity to Shakespeare's, may in fact be more in tune with Mrs. Malaprop, a famous theatrical character who appeared in Richard Sheridan's 1775 play ""The Rivals."" The great lady would lend her name to the confusion of language, as when she meant to say pinnacle but referred to another character as ""the very pineapple of politeness."" I knew a burned-out teacher who would collect and publish his student's mistakes, such as a passage in which a young woman was said to ""tilt her head with a delicate air of expectoration.""  Ptooey! Children's mistakes are often among the most creative. My niece Mary Hope electrified her family by referring to something as an obstacle illusion. This seemed amusing but useless until the recent day when I thought I saw an orange cone blocking my exit from a casino parking garage. Well guess what?  Turned out to be an obstacle illusion. Lewis Carroll made great use of blends in poems such as ""Jabberwocky,"" in which slimy and lithe collide to form slithy. A Canadian radio word contest invited listeners to coin a word for that straining sound a Canadian car makes on a frigid morning? The winner was a blend: cranksinatra. The most popular guess is that refudiate was an unintended blend of refute and repudiate. I like the fact that the sound ""feud"" rests in the middle because that seems to define Palin's form of maverickism: feudish. And let's not forget the verb refuse, meaning to reject. There may even be a historical allusion here (perhaps an obstacle allusion) to Refuseniks, those disgruntled Soviet citizens not permitted to emigrate. Perhaps another influence is radiate. Maybe if you radiate refusal, perhaps can be said to refudiate. It's all good. I'm for more fun and more color in political speech, including the occasional swing and miss that turns into a home run. The alternative is all script and spin, all euphemism and disclaimer, all flap and doodle, signifying nothing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roy Peter Clark.","Roy Peter Clark: Sarah Palin's creation of a new work, ""refudiate,"" was inspired .

"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN)  -- A 15-year-old boy who was burned over 65 percent of his body in October when he was set on fire, allegedly by a group of teenagers, was released from the hospital Tuesday, officials said. Michael Brewer was discharged from the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center, spokeswoman Lorraine Nelson said in a written statement. Doctors and Brewer's mother, Valerie, will speak to reporters Wednesday, Nelson said. Brewer's family is headed not to their Deerfield Beach, Florida, home, but to an undisclosed location, a source close to the family said. Nelson said the family had requested privacy before the teen's discharge. Brewer suffered second- and third-degree burns over about two-thirds of his body in the October 12 incident, the hospital's associate director, Dr. Carl Schulman, has said. He told CNN's Tony Harris last month that the teen faces a lifelong recovery from his injuries. ""Michael's still got a lot of major surgery ahead of him, a lot of rehabilitation and therapy,"" Schulman said. ""... the recovery is lifelong. This is truly a life-changing event."" The hospital released some photographs of Brewer taken Tuesday morning in the hospital's rehabilitation unit. In the pictures his burns are clearly visible. Three teens -- Denver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, both 15, and Jesus Mendez, 16 -- are accused of being in a group that poured alcohol over Brewer and set him ablaze in what police said was a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle. All three teens are charged as adults with one count of attempted murder. Each has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, each could face a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. Detectives say eyewitnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis poured alcohol over him. Bent allegedly encouraged the attack, police said. Brewer jumped into a pool at his apartment complex to put out the flames. Authorities have said Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire. According to an arrest transcript, the boy said he made a ""bad decision."" Valerie Brewer said last month that her son's treatment at times has been excruciatingly painful. Physical therapy, she said, is ""incredibly painful. He almost cries because it's so painful. He's burned badly on the backs of his knees and every time he moves his knee, it pulls, and if it's healing, it pulls the scab and it cracks and it starts to bleed."" The 13-year-old brother of one of the accused youths made a public statement in November. Jeremy Jarvis said he wanted to ""express his deepest sympathy to Mikey and his family"" and added he was praying for Brewer's recovery. Jeremy Jarvis was arrested as a juvenile after the incident and spent about 30 days in juvenile detention. However, prosecutors have not filed charges against him and are still determining how to proceed. He could still be charged, as prosecutors have 90 days from his arrest to decide whether to move forward with the case. Jeremy Jarvis' attorney, Stephen Melnick, said it appeared the younger Jarvis was only a witness to the attack. Valerie Brewer said she was heartbroken when she learned her son's attackers may have included teens who they knew. ""But we don't focus on that,"" she said last month. ""We focus strictly on Michael and his recovery."" CNN's Rich Phillips contributed to this report.","Michael Brewer, 15, allegedly set on fire by other teens, faces more surgery .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The trial of a Mexican soap opera star -- accused of paying an American to marry her so she could work into the United States -- will also feature a star from a U.S. reality show. Celebrity photographer Markus Klinko, star of Bravo's ""Double Exposure,"" hired an investigator to gather evidence of Fernanda Romero's alleged sham marriage, according to prosecution and defense documents. Romero, 28, was arrested on marriage fraud charges in April and her federal trial begins Tuesday in Los Angeles. Her husband is also accused. She would never have been prosecuted if Klinko had not personally financed an investigation of his former girlfriend and delivered the results to immigration agents, the defense said. ""Klinko went to great lengths to see to it that this case was criminally prosecuted and ... did so because of his animus toward defendant Fernanda Romero,"" a defense petition said. When Klinko, 49, takes the stand as a prosecution witness, the defense will try to prove that the Swiss native engaged in his own sham marriage two decades earlier, according to a defense document filed in court. A Texas woman, in a sworn statement filed with the court, said Klinko paid her $20,000 for a sham marriage in 1987. ""The marriage between Markus and me was done for the sole purpose of allowing Markus Klinko to obtain a green card,"" Victoria Waisman said in a sworn statement filed with the court. The Klinko-Waisman marriage ended after just four months and was never used for a green card application, the defense document said. Klinko married another woman a day after his divorce from Waisman was finalized. It was through that second marriage that Klinko obtained a U.S. work visa, the defense said. ""As the Waisman evidence shows, Klinko was quite familiar with the crime of marriage fraud, thus was able to construct a somewhat believable case against the defendants,"" a defense petition said. Klinko, through an attorney, denied to CNN the accusation that he had been involved in a sham marriage. Klinko earlier denied to CNN that he personally sought to have Romero, his one-time girlfriend, prosecuted. It was his lawyer who gathered and presented the evidence to immigration officials, he said. He said it was not because he was angry over their breakup, but it was part of a legal battle with Romero and Michael Ball, the owner of the Rock & Republic clothing company. Romero was then a model for Ball's company. Klinko said he turned the evidence over to the government because he feared extortion from Ball and Romero. The former lawyer, Anthony Lopresti, said in a filing in Klinko's bankruptcy case that it was Klinko who hired the investigator ""to pursue the criminal prosecution and/or deportation of Ms. Romero."" The investigation, which Klinko insisted on, was ""outside the scope"" of the lawsuit, Lopresti said. Romero has appeared in at least 15 television shows and films since 2005, according to the Internet Movie Database, when prosecutors allege she paid Kent Ross, a pizza deliveryman and musician, to marry her. The prosecutor in the case, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jim Left, said Romero could get between 15 and 21 months in prison if convicted, though such cases usually produce shorter sentences. The case is unusual because marriage fraud charges are usually litigated by immigration authorities rather than prosecuted as criminal cases. The federal complaint accused Romero of paying Ross, 28, to marry her on June 12, 2005, but alleges they never lived together as a couple. Romero began dating Klinko a month later, and they lived together for several months, the complaint said. According to a sworn affidavit by ICE Senior Special Agent Bonita Canterberry filed in the case, Klinko and Romero's relationship ended in 2007, about the same time Klinko filed a lawsuit against Rock & Republic jeans company and its owner, Ball, alleging breach of contract in relation to a photo shoot. Klinko also accused Ball of extortion. ""In connection with the civil suit, Klinko's attorney and private investigators looked into the claim that Ball had arranged for the sham marriage between Romero and Ross. Klinko and his attorney turned over to ICE documentation and findings from their investigation, which, in turn, led to the government's investigation into Romero's marriage to Ross,"" Canterberry's affidavit says . The complaint names Michael Ball as a target of the federal investigation, alleging that he helped arrange the sham marriage while Romero was modeling for his company. Romero's show business career began in Mexico at age 16 when she joined the ensemble Frizzby, her Internet Movie Database biography says. The group toured Mexico and Central America, releasing two top-10 singles, it says. She started hosting television shows and appearing on commercials in Mexico when she was 18, it says. Romero has appeared in print and TV ad campaigns for Rock and Republic, Clean and Clear, Pepsi, Apple and JC Penney, it says. ""She was cast in Telemundo's original production 'Wounded Soul,' where she was not only a lead actress, but also a lead singer, performing two songs in the soap opera's soundtrack,"" her biography says.","NEW: Markus Klinko denies he also had a sham marriage .

"(CNN) -- The Afghan government said Monday it was ""shocked"" as it sifted through tens of thousands of leaked U.S. military and diplomatic reports on the war in Afghanistan that a whistleblower website posted a day earlier. ""The Afghan government is shocked with the report that has opened the reality of the Afghan war,"" said Siamak Herawi, a government spokesman.

Are you reading the documents? Tell us what you find .

The Department of Defense will not comment on them until the Pentagon has had a chance to look at them, a Defense official told CNN. ""What you have here is you have a variety of reports of different types,"" said New York Times reporter Chris Chivers. ""Many of them are simple incident reports. The military describing ... on the ground what happened. Incident by incident."" The New York Times reported Sunday that military field documents included in the release suggest that Pakistan, an ally of the United States in the war against terror, has been running something of a ""double game,"" allowing ""representatives of its spy service to meet directly with the Taliban in secret strategy sessions to organize networks of militant groups that fight against American soldiers in Afghanistan, and even hatch plots to assassinate Afghan leaders."" Herawi charged that Washington needed to deal with Pakistani intelligence, known as the ISI. ""There should be serious action taken against the ISI, who has a direct connection with the terrorists,"" he said. ""These reports show that the U.S. was already aware of the ISI connection with the al Qaeda terrorist network. The United States is overdue on the ISI issue and now the United States should answer."" But Gen. Hamid Gul, the former head of Pakistan's intelligence service and who is mentioned numerous times in the Wikileaks reports, called the accusations lies. ""These reports are absolutely and utterly false,"" Gul said Monday. ""I think they [United States] are failing and they're looking for scapegoats."" Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, issued a statement Sunday saying the reports ""do not reflect the current onground realities."" Rather, they ""reflect nothing more than single source comments and rumors, which abound on both sides of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and are often proved wrong after deeper examination,"" Haqqani's statement said. ""Pakistan's government under the democratically elected leadership of President [Asif Ali] Zardari and Prime Minister [Yousuf Raza] Gilani is following a clearly laid out strategy of fighting and marginalizing terrorists and our military and intelligence services are effectively executing that policy,"" the statement said. National Security Adviser Gen. James Jones issued a statement Sunday calling the documents' release ""irresponsible."" ""The United States strongly condemns the disclosure of classified information by individuals and organizations which could put the lives of Americans and our partners at risk, and threaten our national security,"" the statement said. ""These irresponsible leaks will not impact our ongoing commitment to deepen our partnerships with Afghanistan and Pakistan; to defeat our common enemies; and to support the aspirations of the Afghan and Pakistani people,"" the statement said. Assange declined to tell CNN where he got the documents. Jones' statement said the website made ""no effort"" to contact the Obama administration about the documents. ""The United States government learned from news organizations that these documents would be posted,"" Jones' statement said. Assange claims the documents reveal the ""squalor"" of war, uncovering how many relatively small incidents have added up to huge numbers of dead civilians. The significance lies in ""all of these people being killed in the small events that we haven't heard about that numerically eclipse the big casualty events. It's the boy killed by a shell that missed a target,"" he told CNN. ""What we haven't seen previously is all those individual deaths,"" he said. ""We've seen just the number and, like Stalin said, 'One man's death is a tragedy, a million dead is a statistic.' So, we've seen the statistic."" WikiLeaks publishes anonymously submitted documents, video and other sensitive materials after vetting them, it says. It claims never to have fallen for a forgery. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, said in a statement Sunday that the documents -- regardless of how they came to light -- ""raise serious questions about the reality of America's policy toward Pakistan and Afghanistan."" Wikileaks has previously made headlines for posting controversial videos of combat in Iraq. The site gained international attention in April when it posted a 2007 video said to show a U.S. helicopter attack in Iraq killing a dozen civilians, including two unarmed Reuters journalists. At the time, Maj. Shawn Turner, a U.S. military spokesman, said that ""all evidence available supported the conclusion by those forces that they were engaging armed insurgents and not civilians."" Pfc. Bradley Manning, 22, suspected of leaking a classified 2007 video, has been charged by the U.S. military with eight violations of the U.S. Criminal Code for transferring classified data, according to a charge sheet released by the military earlier this month. Attempts to reach Manning's military defense attorney, Capt. Paul Bouchard, were unsuccessful Sunday. However, U.S. Army spokesman Col. Tom Collins has said Bouchard would not speak to the media about the charges. Assange says WikiLeaks has attempted to put together a legal team to defend Manning, something it will do for any ""alleged"" whistleblower that runs into legal trouble because of WikiLeaks. Assange -- a former teen hacker who launched the site in 2007 -- denies that WikiLeaks has put troops in danger. ""There certainly have been people who have lost elections as a result of material being on WikiLeaks,"" he said. ""There have been prosecutions because of material being on WikiLeaks. There have been legislative reforms because of material being on WikiLeaks,"" he said. ""What has not happened is anyone being physically harmed as a result."" The website held back about 15,000 documents from Afghanistan to protect individuals who informed on the Taliban, he said. But he said he hoped his website would be ""very dangerous"" to ""people who want to conduct wars in an abusive way."" ""This material doesn't just reveal occasional abuse by the U.S. military,"" he said. ""Of course it has U.S. military reporting on all sort of abuses by the Taliban. ... So it does describe the abuses by both sides in this war and that's how people can understand what's really going on and if they choose to support it or not."" Assange said the organization gets material from whistle-blowers in a variety of ways -- including via postal mail -- vets it, releases it to the public and then defends itself against ""the regular political or legal attack."" He said the organization rarely knows the identity of the source of the leak. ""If we find out at some stage, we destroy that information as soon as possible,"" he said.

"London, England (CNN) -- The debut album by New York rock band The Strokes has been named ""album of the decade"" by influential British music magazine, NME. Released in 2001, ""Is This It"" topped the 100 Greatest Albums Of The Decade list compiled by a panel of musicians, producers, writers and record label bosses, according to NME.com. The Libertines' 2002 debut ""Up the Bracket"" was runner-up, with Primal Scream's ""XTRMNTR"" from 2000 in third spot. The Strokes formed in 1999 with a line-up that includes lead vocalist Julian Casablancas, guitarists Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond, Jr., bassist Nikolai Fraiture, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. Fans had to wait two years before ""Is This It"" was finally released to critical acclaim, with hits such as ""Last Night"" and ""Hard to Explain"" underlining their Velvet Underground-inspired garage rock sound. However, the album fared better among British fans, reaching number two in the charts compared to 33 in the United States. The band's second album, ""Room On Fire"", was released in 2003 and again reached number two in the British charts with singles including ""12:51"" and ""Reptilia."" But their third album, ""First Impressions of Earth"", gave the band its first number one success, when it snatched top spot in Britain in 2006. It also reached the hitherto unknown heights of number four across the Atlantic. On hearing about the NME accolade, frontman Casablancas told the BBC: ""It's totally crazy! I thought it was great when I heard. ""But does it mean it's a good musical decade or a bad musical decade? I don't know, I'm such a bad judge of my own stuff.""","""Is This It"" topped the 100 Greatest Albums Of The Decade list compiled by a panel of musicians, producers, writers .

"(CNN) -- Here are reactions to the posting on WikiLeaks.org of tens of thousands of leaked U.S. military and diplomatic reports on the war in Afghanistan: . Afghanistan: . ""The Afghan government is shocked with the report that has opened the reality of the Afghan war,"" said Siamak Herawi, a government spokesman. Herawi focused on the allegation that Pakistan was secretly supporting al Qaeda and asserted that Washington needs to deal with the Pakistani intelligence agency, known as the ISI. ""There should be serious action taken against the ISI, who has a direct connection with the terrorists,"" he said. ""These reports show that the U.S. was already aware of the ISI connection with the al Qaeda terrorist network. The United States is overdue on the ISI issue, and now the United States should answer."" Pakistan: . In a statement, Pakistan's foreign office said Monday that the documents are ""misplaced, skewed and contrary to the factual position on the ground."" ""The people of Pakistan and its security forces, including the ISI, have rendered enormous sacrifices against militancy and terrorism. Our contributions have been acknowledged by the international community, in particular by the United States. As underlined by the U.S. national security adviser in his statement on Wikileaks yesterday, the ongoing counterterrorism cooperation between Pakistan and the [United States] will continue with a view to defeating our common enemies."" Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul, the former head of Pakistan's intelligence service who is mentioned numerous times in the WikiLeaks documents, called the accusations that Pakistan was secretly supporting al Qaeda lies. Qamar Zaman Kaira, Pakistan's federal information minister, said allegations against the ISI are ""baseless."" ""If someone has any evidence, it should be brought to us, and we will take action,"" he said. ""The Pakistani military, especially the ISI, has sacrificed more than any other forces in the war on terrorism."" A spokesman for Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, Farahnaz Ispahani, said the ""unsubstantiated leaks"" based on uncorroborated ""one-sided reports ... will not deter the Pakistani government's commitment to the eradication of terrorism, peace with our neighbors and stability in the region."" Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, issued a statement Sunday saying the reports ""do not reflect the current onground realities."" Rather, they ""reflect nothing more than single source comments and rumors, which abound on both sides of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and are often proved wrong after deeper examination,"" Haqqani's statement said. ""Pakistan's government under the democratically elected leadership of President Zardari and Prime Minister [Yousuf Raza] Gilani is following a clearly laid out strategy of fighting and marginalizing terrorists, and our military and intelligence services are effectively executing that policy,"" the statement said. United States: . Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, said in a statement that some of the documents ""reinforce a longstanding concern of mine about the supporting role of some Pakistani officials in the Afghan insurgency."" Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he had ""strongly urged the Pakistanis to take forceful action against militant networks using Pakistan as a base to attack Afghanistan and our troops."" But he said Obama's new strategy ""has yielded some tangible improvements in preparing Afghanistan to take responsibility for its own security."" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs called the documents' release ""a breach of federal law"" and said that an investigation into the source of the leak was initiated before late last week. But, he told reporters, ""I don't think that what is being reported hasn't in many ways been publicly discussed -- whether by you or by representatives of the U.S. government -- for quite some time."" Asked about the leak, he said, ""There is no doubt that this is a concerning development in operational security."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday that the release would not affect a $33 billion war supplemental vote, to be held this week. ""A lot of it predates the president's new policy,"" she said. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, who is co-sponsoring a bill that would direct President Obama to remove U.S. forces from Pakistan, said the documents ""provide a fuller picture of what we have long known about Afghanistan: The war is going badly."" He added, ""It is not the leak of documents that endangers the lives of American troops and our allies, it is the belief that occupying Afghanistan will make us safer. Congress must say no to war funding, bring our troops home and invest in the American recovery."" Sen. Kit Bond, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called the release of the documents ""shocking."" ""The damage to our national security caused by leaks like this won't stop until we see more perpetrators in orange jumpsuits,"" the Missouri Republican said in a statement. The senator stressed that the leak underscores the need to start taking more seriously the threat to national security that leaks cause. Bond pointed out that this is not a new problem: The bipartisan September 11 Commission found that national security was threatened by widespread leaks of classified information. This point was emphasized by former CIA Director Michael Hayden, who testified before Congress that because of leaks, the U.s. effectively has applied ""Darwinian Theory"" to terrorists: catching only the dumb ones. National Security Adviser Gen. James Jones issued a statement Sunday condemning the documents' release. ""These irresponsible leaks will not impact our ongoing commitment to deepen our partnerships with Afghanistan and Pakistan; to defeat our common enemies; and to support the aspirations of the Afghan and Pakistani people,"" the statement said. The Department of Defense will not comment on them until the Pentagon has had a chance to look at them, a department official said. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, issued a statement Sunday saying that the documents -- regardless of how they came to light -- ""raise serious questions about the reality of America's policy toward Pakistan and Afghanistan."" House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton, D-Missouri, issued a statement saying: ""I am extremely concerned about the manner in which these documents were leaked and with the recklessness of WikiLeaks in posting them. Our nation's secrets are classified for a reason, and the release of classified documents could put our national security -- and the lives of our men and women in combat -- at serious risk. ""These leaked documents, while troubling, appear to support what I was asserting for years: The war in Afghanistan was not going well, and we needed a real strategy for success. For nearly a decade under the previous administration, our brave war fighters were under-resourced and lacked the direction of a clear strategy. Under the new counterinsurgency strategy implemented earlier this year, we now have the pieces in place to turn things around. These leaked reports pre-date our new strategy in Afghanistan and should not be used as a measure of success or a determining factor in our continued mission there. ""Additionally, some of these documents implicate Pakistan in aiding the Taliban and fueling the insurgency in Afghanistan. It is critical that we not use outdated reports to paint a picture of the cooperation of Pakistan in our efforts in Afghanistan. Since these reports were issued, Pakistan has significantly stepped up its fight against the Taliban, including efforts that led to the capture of the highest ranking member of the Taliban since the start of the war. The Pakistani military has also been in combat for more than a year against its country's own Taliban, which is aligned with al Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban attacking American forces and our NATO allies. While we still have concerns about Pakistan's efforts against the Afghan Taliban, there is no doubt that there have been significant improvements in its overall effort."" Britain: . UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said: ""I have not seen those [reports] in detail, but they should not be damaging the international efforts. We saw last week in Afghanistan the huge progress that is being made and the phenomenal challenges that are still in front of us in Afghanistan. But the fact that a good deal of progress is being made in building up the capacity of the Afghan state and Afghanistan working together with so many nations in the world. I hope any leaks will not poison that atmosphere, and I do not think they will."" WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange said the documents are ""legitimate,"" but he added that it is important not to take their contents at face value. ""We publish CIA reports all the time that are legitimate CIA reports. That doesn't mean the CIA is telling the truth,"" he said. ""Similarly, with this material, there is reporting from military units of various kinds, in Afghanistan, U.S. embassies across the world, about matters relevant to Afghanistan. ...

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Days before Arizona's controversial law targeting illegal immigration takes effect, demonstrators are finalizing their plans to descend upon the state capital to show their support for or opposition to the measure. The protests will include busloads of labor union members from Los Angeles who oppose Senate Bill 1070 because they believe it promotes racial profiling, . They plan to dare law enforcement in Phoenix, Arizona, to put SB 1070 to the test, according to Maria Elena Durazo, one of the organizers of the rally. ""We will not be carrying 'papers,' "" said Durazo, of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. ""We will let them know we are coming, and we will tell them: Arrest us for being brown or black, arrest us for being suspicious."" The protesters include immigrant students, religious leaders, day laborers and members of several unions including the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, the Teamsters and the Utility Workers of America Union. But not all Latinos oppose Arizona's law, which takes effect Thursday. Poll: One in four Americans angry over illegal immigration . Jesse Hernandez is a member of the Arizona Republican Latino Association, a group that supports SB 1070 and opposes the U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit challenging it. Hernandez said Arizona's law does nothing more than federal law already allows.  He believes Durazo and her ""left-wing"" supporters are simply misinformed. ""They throw out this verbiage, racist, discrimination, Nazis -- they're just trying to drum up fear among the public,"" Hernandez said. ""We live in a society that doesn't read anymore, that is spoon-fed by TV. That's why I'm challenging them to pick up the law and read it and not believe the rhetoric that is coming out from the left."" iReport: Tell us what you think . Section 2 of SB 1070 states that law enforcement cannot stop a person for the sole purpose of determining immigration status. An officer can inquire about immigration status only if a person is stopped or detained on suspicion of another crime, and if there is reasonable suspicion that the person is in the U.S. illegally. Many, like Hernandez, believe that section guards against racial profiling. Read what others think about immigration reform . But immigrant rights activist Angelica Salas dismisses that, citing the aggressive and controversial immigration enforcement by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. ""We're telling you about what we know, we've seen it over and over again,"" said Salas, who represents the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. ""Don't tell us what's true and what's not when we know what we have seen and the consequence of racial profiling in Maricopa County for years,"" she said. ""And what Sheriff Joe is doing is now sanctioned by the state of Arizona."" Arpaio -- who calls himself ""America's toughest sheriff"" --  has ignited controversy for his sweeps of illegal immigrants using a federal program called 287(g) that allows local law enforcement to be cross-trained by the Department of Homeland Security and work in immigration enforcement. Salas will be heading to Phoenix along with Durazo and the other busloads of protesters this week. There have been three court hearings to consider challenges to the Arizona law, including one from the Department of Justice. To date, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton has yet to rule on the law's fate. Read more about the court challenges . Durazo said that even if there is an injunction, they will still go. She says the fight will continue until the law is repealed.","Arizona's controversial immigration enforcement law takes effect Thursday .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- How well Zsa Zsa Gabor is recovering from hip replacement surgery a week ago depends on whom you ask: her husband or her daughter. Prince Frederic Von Anhalt said his wife of 24 years is in ""critical"" condition, but daughter Francesca Hilton said her condition is ""guarded."" Gabor, 93, suffered a broken hip in a fall at her Bel Air, California, home nine days ago. ""It's up and down,"" Von Anhalt said Monday afternoon. ""It worries me very much."" The publicist for Hilton, however, gave a more optimistic report. Edward Lozzi said the glamour icon was able to sit up in bed and talk, an improvement that followed a blood transfusion and the removal of her morphine drip over the weekend. Gabor has ""rallied"" and is ""more talkative,"" Lozzi said. She is still in the intensive care unit at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, but the prince's publicist, John Blanchette, said she could go home as soon as Thursday. Gabor's fall happened as she reached to answer the phone while watching the television game show ""Jeopardy,"" which is ""a must-see show"" for the actress, her husband said. Gabor has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, according to Blanchette. The crash occurred when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Von Anhalt is either Gabor's eighth or ninth husband, depending on whether you count one marriage that was quickly annulled. Francesca Hilton is her only child, the product of her second marriage to hotel magnate Conrad Hilton. The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her other husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge""; ""The Story of Three Loves,"" 1953; ""The Girl in the Kremlin,"" 1957; and Orson Welles' classic ""Touch of Evil,"" 1958. In 1989, Gabor was sentenced to 72 hours in jail for slapping a Beverly Hills police officer after a traffic stop. She also had to perform community service at a battered women's shelter. The other Gabor sisters were Magda, the oldest, who died in 1997 five days shy of 83, and Eva, the youngest, who died in 1995 at 76. Magda, an occasional stage actress, also was married to Sanders at one time. Eva is probably best remembered for her role as a socialite turned farmer's wife on the 1960s TV sitcom ""Green Acres.""","Gabor's husband says actress' condition is ""critical""

"(CNN) -- South Africa has named Caster Semenya, the women's world 800 meter champion, in their squad for the 2010 Commonwealth Games which will take place in New Delhi, India. The selection -- which was confirmed on the official website of the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC) -- follows Semenya taking three wins from all three of her recent comeback races following her return to the track in July. Prior to this, the 19-year-old had been forced into an 11-month hiatus from competition after the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) banned her following a urine sample test which revealed high levels of testosterone. The event will mark Semenya's first participation in international competition since her ban was lifted following gender tests. ""I'm very happy to see the return of Caster Semenya to duty for South Africa. We have observed her progress closely since the IAAF cleared her to run and it's good to hear her say that she's focusing all her efforts on the Commonwealth. ""The fact that she's unbeaten in her three races thus far and has improved her time on each occasion is good news for our medal effort in New Delhi,"" SASCOC president Gideon Sam told the website. Semenya clocked a time of 1:59.90 at the ISTAF meeting in Berlin at the weekend which, though four seconds short of her 1:55.45 personal best, was enough to draw criticism from fellow runners. Diane Cummins of Canada, Great Britain's Jemma Simpson and Elisa Cusma Piccione of Italy all questioned whether should be allowed to continue to compete in the sport. Cummins -- who finished eighth in race Semenya won on Sunday's race -- told British newspaper The Daily Telegraph the sport's governing body needed to think again. ""Unfortunately for Caster, she's grown up in an environment that is complicated not just for her but for human science. Basically, is she man, is she lady? What constitutes male, what constitutes female?"" Cummins added: ""Even if she is a female, she's on the very fringe of the normal athlete female biological composition from what I understand of hormone testing. So, from that perspective, most of us just feel that we are literally running against a man."" Michael Seme, Semenya's coach, told reporters that the negative comments would not affect his runner. ""It's up to them to say and do what they want to. For us we don't say anything. As long as the organizers of these meetings invite us, there is no problem,"" he said. The Commonwealth Games take place in the Indian capital from 3-14 October. Elsewhere, German sportswear manufacturer Puma annouced on their website they had completed a record sponsorship deal with 100 and 200 meter world record holder Usain Bolt. The Jamaican sprinter -- who has his own clothing line with the company --renewed his contract which Puma described as ""by far the largest ever given to a track and field athlete"" and which puts ""Bolt among the top-earners across all sports.""","South Africa has named Caster Semenya in their squad for the 2010 Commonwealth Games .

"ZHOUSHAN, China (CNN)  -- They operate from a bare apartment on a Chinese island. They are intelligent 20-somethings who seem harmless. But they are hard-core hackers who claim to have gained access to the world's most sensitive sites, including the Pentagon. The leader of these Chinese hackers says there ""is always a weakness"" on networks that allows cyber break-ins. In fact, they say they are sometimes paid secretly by the Chinese government -- a claim the Beijing government denies. ""No Web site is one hundred percent safe. There are Web sites with high-level security, but there is always a weakness,"" says Xiao Chen, the leader of this group. ""Xiao Chen"" is his online name. Along with his two colleagues, he does not want to reveal his true identity. The three belong to what some Western experts say is a civilian cyber militia in China, launching attacks on government and private Web sites around the world.  Watch hackers' clandestine Chinese operation ¬ª . If there is a profile of a cyber hacker, these three are straight from central casting -- young and thin, with skin pale from spending too many long nights in front of a computer. One hacker says he is a former computer operator in the People's Liberation Army; another is a marketing graduate; and Xiao Chen says he is a self-taught programmer. ""First, you must know about the Web site you want to attack. You must know what program it is written with,"" says Xiao Chen. ""There is a saying, 'Know about both yourself and the enemy, and you will be invincible.'"" CNN decided to withhold the address of these hackers' Web site, but Xiao Chen says it has been operating for more than three years, with 10,000 registered users. The site offers tools, articles, news and flash tutorials about hacking. Private computer experts in the United States from iDefense Security Intelligence, which provides cybersecurity advice to governments and Fortune 500 companies, say the group's site ""appears to be an important site in the broader Chinese hacking community."" Arranging a meeting with the hackers took weeks of on-again, off-again e-mail exchanges. When they finally agreed, CNN was told to meet them on the island of Zhoushan, just south of Shanghai and a major port for China's navy. The apartment has cement floors and almost no furniture. What they do have are three of the latest computers. They are cautious when it comes to naming the Web sites they have hacked. On camera, Xiao Chen denies knowing anyone who has targetted U.S. government Web sites. But off-camera, in conversations over three days, he claims two of his colleagues -- not the ones with him in the room -- hacked into the Pentagon and downloaded information, although he wouldn't specify what was gleaned. CNN has no way to confirm if his claim is true. ""They would not publicize this,"" he says of someone who hacks the U.S. Defense Department. ""It is very sensitive."" This week, the Pentagon said computer networks in the United States, Germany, Britain and France were hit last year by what they call ""multiple intrusions,"" many of them originating from China. At a congressional hearing in Washington last week, administration officials testified that the government's cyber initiative has fallen far short of what is required. Most alarming, the officials said, there has never been a full damage assessment of federal agency networks.  Watch Pentagon bans Google from bases ¬ª . ""We are here today because we must do more,"" said Robert Jamison, a top official in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. ""Defending the federal system in its current configuration is a significant challenge."" U.S. officials have been cautious not to directly accuse the Chinese military or its government of hacking into its network. But David Sedney, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia, says, ""The way these intrusions are conducted are certainly consistent with what you would need if you were going to actually carry out cyber warfare."" Beijing hit back at that, denying such an allegation and calling on the United States to provide proof. ""If they have any evidence, I hope they would provide it. Then, we can cooperate on this issue,"" Qin Gang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said during a regular press briefing this week. But again off-camera, Xiao Chen says after the alleged Pentagon attack, his colleagues were paid by the Chinese government. CNN has no way to independently confirm if that is true. His allegations brought strenuous denials from Beijing. ""I am telling you honestly, the Chinese government does not do such a thing,"" Qin said. But if Xiao Chen is telling the truth, it appears his colleagues launched a freelance attack -- not initiated by Beijing, but paid for after the fact. ""These hacker groups in my opinion are not agents of the Chinese state,"" says James Mulvenon from the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis, which works with the U.S. intelligence community. ""They are sort of useful idiots for the Beijing regime."" He adds, ""These young hackers are tolerated by the regime provided that they do not conduct attacks inside of China."" One of the biggest problems experts say is trying to prove where a cyber attack originates from, and that they say allows hackers like Xiao Chen to operate in a virtual world of deniability. And across China, there could be thousands just like him, all trying to prove themselves against some of the most secure Web sites in the world.

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Much has been made of the more than quarter-million homes lost to Katrina along the Gulf Coast, and with good reason. Ride through almost any neighborhood that was hit and even five years later you can see the skeletons of buildings, or empty lots covered with weeds.   But to truly grasp the impact of this storm, you also have to consider who lived in those homes: Working families; the people who make the ports, the fishing business, the oil industry and the tourist attractions work. Florine Jenkins is one of them. Living in the 9th Ward of New Orleans, she has made a living as a housekeeper for many years.   She is African-American, and old enough to tell tales of sitting in the balcony that was restricted for blacks at the city auditorium, while she watched white teens on the main floor below bopping to the music of Little Richard and Fats Domino.   She fled Katrina and returned to find her home underneath a neighbor's house. And like many others here, she had no idea how to navigate the bewildering maze of paperwork involved in rebuilding; forms for insurance companies, government programs, contractors, utility companies, banks, mortgage brokers, on and on it went. ""Did you have any idea how to deal with all that?"" I asked her. She smiled, shook her head, and gave one of the longest single-word answers I've heard. ""Nooooooooooooo."" Then she met Nikki Najioli. Nikki works for Build Now, is middle-aged, white, looks like the businesswomen she is, and spends her days helping others sort out such problems. In a strange way, it helps that she lost her own home and fully understands the thicket of questions that followed the storm. ""Do you tear down your house? Do you put it back together? If you put it back together do you have to elevate it? If you are going to elevate it, how high are you going to elevate it? And where's that money going to come from? It was just so overwhelming and even today it's still overwhelming."" Calming down the fears, and restoring the confidence of people who are trying to rebuild, is what Build Now is all about. Simply put, it is a nonprofit construction company that offers an array of modestly priced home designs, an endless supply of free advice to anyone trying to build, and a commitment to bring the working class neighborhoods back. ""This is the living room area,"" Ben Seymour, the construction manager for Build Now, says as he shows me around one model under construction in a neighborhood that saw eight feet of water. The house soars high in the air upon pilings driven deep into the earth; a lovely, modest home with soft colors, elegant lines, and a style that echoes the surviving homes around it. The homes are made without eaves that a storm could snatch at to tear off the roof. The front porch is anchored to the house much more robustly than as customary, so that it too can stand firm. And most importantly, Seymour says, the basic design of the house can be expanded or contracted to fit the needs and wallets of folks who are watching their money. ""You can size it down. It still gives you a big open feel, and it's built to what you're going to use."" So in every way, these really are working class family homes? ""Absolutely. Absolutely,"" he says. ""They fit the budget."" Even though this is a nonprofit endeavor, and Build Now does try to help homebuyers find financing, this is not a giveaway program. Each person must pay a fair price. Out on the porch I run into Nikki again, looking out at the quiet neighborhood where a few restoration projects seem to be underway. ""How much do these places cost?"" I ask. ""On average,"" she says, ""about $150,000."" Still, for a great many folks, the help they have received from Build Now and other groups which are helping neighborhoods rebuild, is priceless.   Florine Jenkins beams as she shows me the rest of her new home in the 9th Ward, now filled with family photos, furniture, and other personal items. I ask her if she thinks, in retrospect, that she could have pulled off rebuilding on her own given enough time. Her answer is emphatic: No way. ""I didn't know nothing about nothing like that. Build Now took care of everything."" It is a heartfelt testimony to success: Once Katrina left her with nothing but questions. Now, once again, she has a home.","New Orleans residents still trying to rebuild homes hit hard by Hurricane Katrina .

"(Wired) -- Google Voice opened to the public Tuesday. Up to now, you had to have an invitation from a current user before you could sign on to use the innovative phone add-on service. Now, anyone in the U.S. can sign up. Voice, which premiered in invite-only fashion a year ago, provides you with a single phone number that directs calls to your mobile, home or work phone, depending on the rules you set. Beyond that, it includes a basketful of features including transcribed voicemail sent as e-mail or text message, free conference calling, free outbound domestic calls and call-screening. The service is free, except for international calls, which cost a fraction of what the phone company charges per minute. Google Voice used to be known as GrandCentral before Google bought the company in July 2007. Craig Walker, the former CEO of GrandCentral, now runs Google Voice, which he says has a million active users. ""That's a big number for a service that is invite-only,"" Walker said. New users get a free new number, hopefully somewhere near their local area, and in anticipation of a rush, Voice has bought a bunch of numbers spread across the country (though Hawaii and Alaska remain ""challenges""). ""We are pretty optimistic there will be a high demand,"" Walker said. Voice also has native apps for Android and Blackberry phones, while Palm Pre and iPhone users can use the HTML5 app (including to make outbound calls). Google made a full-featured app for the iPhone, which Apple controversially rejected on the grounds it would confuse users. The real cost of iPhone 4 vs. Android rivals . Those who commit to giving out a Google Voice number as their central point of contact aren't locked into Google and can port their number out to a phone company or to competing services such as Toktumi. Users can't yet port their existing numbers into Google Voice, which would eliminate the need to have to ""commit"" to your Voice number by giving it out to friends and contacts, and getting new business cards made. Those unfamiliar with the service can see the features in this Google-produced video. Voice could mature into a service that competes with Skype, which has become the world's largest telephone service by allowing free calls between Skype users and cheap calls from PCs and mobile devices to overseas phone numbers. To that end, Google purchased a Skype competitor called Gizmo5 last November, which lets users make calls from their PCs to other PCs or to the traditional network. Five ways to slash your cell phone bill . Google is currently integrating this into Google Voice, though there is reportedly some internal friction over whether to scrap the downloadable software in favor of an HTML5 web app, even though the latter wouldn't have as good voice quality. Currently, Google Voice calls use the minutes of a mobile phone plan, unlike Skype, which bypasses the voice channel by making calls using data plans.

"(CNN) -- The ambulance sped toward Baton Rouge, Louisiana, from the New Orleans airport, overrun with refugees from a drowned city. A mother pregnant with twins screamed from labor pains. Robbie Prepas, a nurse and midwife who struggles with car sickness, tried to stay focused. The babies weren't going to wait. Five minutes into the ride, Prepas delivered the first twin with no problem. But then, she saw two feet beginning to emerge -- a breech baby. Panic set in. ""Don't push! Don't push! Don't push!"" Today, five years after delivering those twins in the midst of the chaos that Katrina wreaked, Prepas dwells -- not on the death and destruction that was so well-documented -- but on the life that emerged. She and her team delivered 20 healthy babies amid the storm's aftermath in a two-week period that ""changed my life."" ""It's one of those events in America that we should never forget."" Prepas, now 58, has traveled the world with organizations like Save the Children and UNICEF. She went to Ghana, Namibia and Zimbabwe in the 1990s to teach midwives in those African countries how best to deal with emergencies. A year before Katrina, she traveled to Afghanistan with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to figure out why so many mothers and babies were dying at a hospital in Kabul. As Hurricane Katrina spun toward the Gulf, the urge to help came natural. Based out of San Diego, Prepas was a member of California's Disaster Medical Assistance Team, a group of about 30 physicians, general practitioners, nurses, nurse practitioners and other specialists. They were told to head to Louis Armstrong International Airport, along with teams from Oregon and Washington. Katrina had swept ashore, and the levee had been breached. ""I had never in my life seen such a disaster as I had in New Orleans,"" Prepas says. ""And, believe me, I've seen the worst of everything."" At the airport, thousands of people milled about. Elderly patients from nursing homes had been dropped off, without medications or even adult diapers. Electricity was out, and there was no running water. ""There were two policemen and two security guards,"" Prepas says. ""There was no organization. We didn't know who to answer to. ... Nobody was in charge."" Prepas and the other 89 medical professionals swung into action. They set up three tents at the front of the airport -- green, for walking wounded and pregnant women; yellow, for slightly more serious conditions; red, for critical patients. ""By the end of two weeks, we had screened and triaged more than 20,000 people."" Prepas was stationed in the green tent, and, at one point, was caring for 50 prenatal patients. She was sleeping on a luggage carousel when the first woman in labor arrived. Prepas set up a privacy sheet in the tent and prepared a cot. The first baby to be born at the airport was healthy. ""His name was David,"" she says. On the third day, U.S. military personnel arrived to establish order amid the pandemonium. On that same day, the woman pregnant with twins was brought to the airport. Prepas still doesn't know how the woman got there. ""She was 8 centimeters dilated, and she was ready to deliver."" The woman's husband and two sons were at the convention center with no idea she was in labor, or where she had gone. All Prepas knew was: ""I had to get her out."" Frantically searching for an ambulance, Prepas found a group of paramedics who had driven more than 500 miles from Nashville, Tennessee. ""Guys, you've got to drive me to Baton Rouge,"" Prepas barked. ""Now!"" The paramedics radioed a hospital in Baton Rouge to let them know they were bringing a woman in labor with twins. The two baby boys had other plans. Both boys were delivered en route. The second child, who came out feet first, was discolored. He received oxygen for the next 30 minutes, until they arrived. Two more weeks passed before that mother and her babies were reunited with the rest of their family. Prepas' time in New Orleans affected her profoundly on so many different levels. Prepas has curtailed most of her overseas humanitarian missions; she now flies mostly to places in need within the U.S. -- the quake in Haiti being an exception. A member of the White Ribbon Alliance for Safe Motherhood, Prepas has used the experience to bring attention to rising maternal mortality rates inside the United States, one of the worst in the industrialized world. In 1982, eight women died per 100,000 live births in the U.S.; now, the figure has jumped to 17 per 100,000, largely due to lack of health care for the nation's poorest women, according to the White Ribbon Alliance. ""Women are going to have babies out of place,"" especially during disaster, she says. ""We have to be prepared for that."" One of the toughest things about her job in New Orleans was delivering the babies -- and then walking away. ""Life goes on after an emergency,"" she says. ""I never stayed in touch with them ... but I think about it all the time. It drives me to keep wanting to do all this stuff. It's given me a mission in life.""","Robbie Prepas focuses not on the destruction of Katrina, but the life that emerged .

"Washington (CNN) -- Forget red versus blue. The nation's capital is seeing green. Fifty-five years after debuting on a Washington television station, the original Kermit the Frog puppet was donated Wednesday to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. America's favorite amphibian was one of 10 puppets from the 1950s show ""Sam and Friends"" given to the museum by the family of Muppets creator Jim Henson. Included in the cast of characters joining Kermit at his new home are Pierre the French Rat, a voracious purple skull named Yorick, and a yellow monster called Mushmellon -- possibly an early ancestor of Oscar the Grouch. The Museum of American History also has, among other things, a 1969 version of Kermit the Frog, Howdy Doody, and Edgar Bergen's ventriloquist dummy Charlie McCarthy. ""With these puppets we provide insights into American identity, and we also explore entertainment and popular culture throughout our history,"" said Brent Glass, the museum's director. ""Jim Henson embodied the innovation and ingenuity that are inherent in American culture. Beyond the entertainment value, Henson's creations helped educate and helped inform his audiences, and they continue to influence us today."" ""Sam and Friends"" ran on Washington's NBC affiliate -- WRC-TV -- from 1955 to 1961. While many of its characters soon faded from public memory, Kermit went on to a starring role in shows such as ""Sesame Street,"" launched in 1969, and ""The Muppet Show,"" which ran from 1976 to 1980.","The original Kermit the Frog puppet has been donated to the Smithsonian .

"(CNN) -- In today's technology-laden society, hearing of crimes solved or cold cases cracked with state-of-the-art tech tools has become commonplace. But for one New Jersey family all it took to catch an alleged thief was a camera and a little luck. John Myers and his family from Bloomfield, New Jersey, were visiting Madison, Wisconsin, to attend a friend's wedding Saturday at the state Capitol. According to Myers, the family went outside after the ceremony to take pictures. He decided it would be a good idea to take a family portrait with his digital camera, and he set a bag down next to the building before stepping away to snap the shot. Unbeknown to him, Myers -- as he captured the scene -- also caught a person red-handed stealing his bag. ""Looking back now it wasn't a good idea to leave my bag so far away,"" Myers told CNN on Tuesday. ""But I just wasn't thinking of it at the time."" Myers looked at the picture quickly but admits he was checking just to make sure everyone came out OK. It was only after walking away that he realized he had forgotten his bag -- which contained his wallet, hotel and rental car keys and other family valuables. Myers said that when he returned to the spot, the bag was missing. No one had turned it in at the information center inside the Capitol. He realized then that someone must have taken it. After stepping outside the building and seeing wedding photographers, he decided to take a second look at the pictures he had just taken. It turned out to be the right hunch. In the background of the family portrait, Myers saw an image of someone reaching into his bag as it sat. He took it to the Wisconsin Capitol Police, which immediately went into action. ""The Capitol Police are amazing,"" Myers said. ""I fully expected to have them tell us to just fill a report [out] or [to] tell us there wasn't much they could do, but [they] responded immediately and because they did, they were able to catch [a suspect]."" After Myers showed the pictures, two officers were immediately dispatched to look for a suspect, while a third stayed with Myers and sent out a description. Within 15 minutes, Myers said, police had arrested a suspect and also located the bag and all his belongings, some of which had been thrown away during the heist. According to Wisconsin authorities, a homeless man identified as Glenn R. Lambright was arrested. He was released Tuesday from Dane County Jail on a signature bond. It was not known Tuesday night whether Lambright had an attorney. Myers said the quick police response pleasantly surprised him. ""I caught the picture, but I was even more amazed they managed to find the person since all they had to go on was his clothing -- his face wasn't in the picture,"" he said.","A New Jersey man snapped a photo of his family during a trip to Wisconsin .

"Washington (CNN) -- The State Department says long-term recovery and reconstruction efforts in flood-ravaged Pakistan could take ""many, many months, if not years."" ""The sheer impact still needs to be assessed, but will certainly be staggering,"" said Dan Feldman, deputy special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, at a press briefing on Monday . Feldman, who surveyed the destruction by helicopter last week with a congressional delegation led by Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, described the damage as ""epic and devastating."" ""Agricultural fields, under water,"" said Feldman. ""Roads and bridges, under water; roads continuously disrupted by water, so impossible to move people or food or supplies out; power plants literally under water."" Feldman said that in addition to the obvious need for immediate relief for what the United Nations describes as millions of displaced flood victims, the U.N. and other international donors will also need to focus on long-term recovery and reconstruction. ""We're looking at ways that we can redirect already existing funds through Kerry-Lugar-Berman and others to meet the needs of flood victims as soon as possible,"" Feldman said, ""so programs for livelihood, for clinics, rebuilding schools, infrastructure that we had already planned, which can be redirected to get to flood victims as quickly as possible."" Feldman was referring to the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 sponsored by Kerry, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, and Rep. Howard Berman, D-California. The law commits $7.5 billion in assistance to Pakistan over five years and is earmarked for ""improving the living conditions of the people of Pakistan through strengthening democracy and the rule of law, sustainable economic development and combating terrorism and extremism,"" according to the law's sponsors. Feldman described ""a real galvanizing moment"" last week, when greater amounts of contributions from the international community began to pour in. ""We've seen over $700 million pledged, including our own $150 million commitment, from over 30 countries, and an additional $300 million in as yet undefined commitments from a range of other countries,"" he said. Feldman said U.S. helicopters have evacuated close to 8,000 people and delivered more than 1.6 million pounds of relief supplies. Deaths are still relatively low at this point, ""at about the 1,500, 1,600 mark,"" said Feldman, but officials are concerned about communicable illnesses breaking out among the millions of displaced victims. The World Health Organization announced Sunday more than 200,000 cases of acute diarrhea have been diagnosed, and there are more than 250,000 cases of disease including scabies. Water levels remain quite high, Feldman said, though some are starting to recede. Broken dikes have aggravated flooding in some areas, he said.","Impact ""will be staggering,"" says State Department official .

"Key West, Fla. (CNN) -- It's been nearly a week since two modern-day pirates walked into the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum in Key West, Florida, and made off with a $550,000 gold bar. Clear video images of the suspects and a reward that's grown to $25,000 haven't yet brought a break in the case. ""This isn't like on television,"" said Melissa Kendrick, executive director of the the museum. ""It doesn't get solved in 22 minutes and a commercial."" Key West Police and the FBI have been working around the clock to solve the mystery, Kendrick said Tuesday. ""We are deeply grateful."" For 25 years, visitors to the museum in Key West, Florida, had the opportunity to lift the glittery piece of treasure in a special display case. No visitors or security guards were in the room the afternoon of August 18 when the gold bar was taken, but a video camera was. ""We're hoping someone will see that footage and help us with a lead,"" said Key West Police spokeswoman Alyson Crean. In the video, one of the two thieves approaches the case, does something and then walks away. While the security guard is out of the room, he comes back, breaks a piece of the case near an opening and removes the bar. He sticks it in his pocket and walks out. ""This is going to end up in somebody's house probably used as a paperweight,"" said Police Chief Donie Lee. ""Other than melting it down, which is the worst-case scenario for everyone."" The bar was recovered by treasure hunter Mel Fisher and his crew in 1980 from the shipwreck of the Santa Margarita, which sank 25 miles west of Key West. The Santa Margarita is the sister ship of the storied galleon Atocha, also worked by Fisher. The ships sank in 1622. The museum's 16.5-karat gold bar weighs 74.85 ounces. The uniqueness of the piece places the bar's value at $550,000, Kendrick said. Fisher, who died in 1998, loved having the bar in a special reach-in case because it allowed visitors to make a connection with the find, she said. An expert in the recovery of art and artifacts said the thieves likely made a huge mistake. The market is small for high-profile items with distinguishing markings. ""We recovered paintings and artifacts that were missing for many years,"" said Robert Wittman, founder of the FBI art crime team and author of ""Priceless."" ""They [thieves] kept them in their closets. They were white elephants. They made no money out of the deals. They were stuck.""

"(CNN) -- A solemn Mass at the Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata, India, marked the 100th anniversary of Mother Teresa's birth on Thursday. People from all walks of life gathered at the global headquarters of the order of nuns, which Mother Teresa founded 60 years ago. ""It's a great day of joy for all of us to celebrate the gift of Mother's life,"" said Sister Nirmala, Mother Teresa's immediate successor. ""Mother who allowed God to live in her has put a bright light in the world, enlightening the hearts and minds of so many people.""

"(CNN) -- While Glenn Beck continues to pathetically assert that he is a modern day Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his listeners and viewers are the rightful heirs to the Civil Rights Movement he spearheaded, it may catch some by surprise that Tea Party leaders claim their movement is also one that is about advancing the civil rights of Americans. During a debate I participated in Wednesday night on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360, Tea Party Express spokesman Mark Williams -- who moonlights as a radio talk show host -- blasted the National Organization for the Advancement of Colored People for not doing anything to fight crime in the inner city, as well as for advancing issues that go against the U.S. Constitution. I had to do everything I could to maintain my composure, considering that the NAACP's long and storied history has been about forcing Americans to actually uphold the Constitution and apply it evenly to all citizens, especially African Americans. Yet as Williams continued his tirade, I really did want to hear exactly what civil rights issues he and other Tea Party members are fighting for. I'm sure they would come as a surprise to civil rights organizations, the folks who are on the frontlines every day. I asked Williams if he would be willing to sit down and meet with the NAACP, the National Urban League, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and other civil rights organizations to find common ground on various civil rights issues. His response? Attend the more than 70 Tea Party rallies in the fall as a participant. Yeah, right. So with my suggestion in mind, it would be great for Williams, Sarah Palin and other Tea Party leaders, advocates and supporters, especially those candidates receiving their backing in November, to clearly state their position on some of the civil rights issues of the day (The following are not in a particular order of importance). Education. President Obama and the Democratic establishment are against the notion of school vouchers. Republicans have advanced the issue for years, yet in Illinois it was GOP members who could have made the difference in vouchers being offered to students who attend schools that rank at the bottom in Chicago. State Sen. James Meeks (who also is founder/senior pastor of Salem Baptist Church of Chicago, Illinois, where I'm a member), fought hard to pass the measure. He was rebuffed by a lot of folks in the Democratic Party, but also a number of Republicans. While we all wait for the day when our public education is fixed for the have-nots, will the Tea Party make education a civil rights issue and demand that students in the worst schools be allowed to leave via vouchers? And will it also fight to equalize funding across the board for those inner city schools that are unable to compete with suburban schools? Racial profiling. There is nothing more insidious and unconstitutional than police officers pulling folks over or frisking them based on nothing in particular, except the color of their skin. Numerous cities and states have documented this horrible practice. The NAACP is gearing up to advance a federal anti-racial profiling bill. Will Mark Williams and the Tea Party join them in an effort to say no more to this hideous practice? Voting rights. The right to vote is at the heart of our democracy, and it's shameful to watch members of both political parties use archaic rules to prevent folks from voting. We have seen voters with no history of criminal activity purged from voting rolls. It's time that we have consistent rules nationally and not be subject to various state, county and city rules. As Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in the Bush vs. Gore decision, there is no affirmative right to vote in the United States. Our Constitution forbids minorities and women being disenfranchised (It's interesting to note that basically white men can be denied the right to vote, depending on how you look at this). In Chicago, if you move from one address to another, you are automatically removed from the voting rolls. Why not have your voting rights follow you to a new address? We have a driver's license that is legal in all parts of a state, why not the voting card? To fix the overlapping and confusing rules, it's time we amend the Constitution and establish a clear and affirmative right to vote. Tea Partiers, are you willing to support that? Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. has had such a bill ready to be voted on for nearly a decade. ""Don't ask, don't tell."" Tea Partiers claim they are all about the U.S. Constitution, that they are patriots. OK, fine. How crazy is it for someone who is gay to be kicked out of the U.S. military solely because of his or her sexuality? The right wing has made a major effort to keep gays and lesbians from serving openly, and the left has fought to have the measure repealed. If the blood of a homosexual flows the same on the battlefield as that of a heterosexual, then what's the problem? Mark Williams, is this the kind of civil right you and the Tea Party support or oppose? Leading a 21st century Poor Peoples Campaign. At the time of his assassination in 1968, Dr. King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference were planning the Poor Peoples Campaign, set for Washington, D.C., to show the plight of poverty in America. Today, we have Republicans in Congress who are against a jobs bill and extending unemployment benefits, but are ardent supporters of keeping the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. Will the Tea Party put the concerns of America's poor at the forefront of its movement? The Civil Rights Movement wasn't just about those at the top, but the downtrodden, disenchanted and ignored. I haven't heard Tea Partiers talking about the least of those among us. So, Mark Williams, will we see Tea Partiers descend on the nation's capital to demand that lawmakers stop ignoring the nation's poor? It's easy for Williams and other Tea Partiers to casually toss out assertions that they are fighting for the civil rights of Americans. Fine, but put your money where your mouth is. It's time to call the Tea Party Express together at the table with the civil rights establishment to forge a comprehensive civil rights strategy headed into the midterm elections and 2011. Saying it is one thing, Tea Partiers, but doing it is another. You've talked the talk, now it's time to walk the walk. So what say you?

"(CNN) -- Lawyers for a man who ran a notorious torture prison in Cambodia where more than 14,000 people died during the 1970s Khmer Rouge regime are appealing his conviction. The lawyers for Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, say he should be acquitted since he was ""a witness of the events of the relevant period"" and should be in witness protection -- not detention. Duch was convicted of war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder and torture in July in a U.N.-backed war crimes tribunal also known as the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. Duch's lawyers also say the court did not have jurisdiction, the appeal states. ""To interpret the applicable law in reliance on international customary law is inconsistent"" with the law of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, according to the appeal. Earlier this month, prosecutors in Cambodia appealed Duch's 30-year sentence, saying the punishment was too light. ""The co-prosecutors are of the view that the judgment gives insufficient weight to the gravity of Duch's crimes and his role and his willing participation in those crimes,"" they said in a statement. ""At the same time, the co-prosecutors believe that undue weight is placed on any mitigating circumstances applicable to Duch."" Some survivors had been angered by the sentence for Duch. His prison term would have been about 19 years after the court took off 11 years for the time he has already served behind bars. The verdict sparked strong reactions as word spread outside the courtroom. Some said it made them lose faith in the U.N.-backed war crimes tribunal. ""It's becoming a sham,"" Cambodian-American Theary Seng, chairwoman of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, said after the verdict. At least 1.7 million people -- nearly a quarter of Cambodia's population -- died under the 1975-1979 Khmer Rouge regime from execution, disease, starvation and overwork, according to the Documentation Center of Cambodia. Duch, 67, was the head of the S-21 prison. Few people brought to the prison made it out alive; only about a dozen were found by the Vietnamese, who invaded Cambodia in 1979. Prosecutors had initially sought a 40-year sentence. The judges first gave Duch 35 years, but took five years off that for the time he was illegally detained before the tribunal was established. Prosecutors have said the judgment failed ""to reflect the full extent of Duch's criminal conduct"" and he should be ""separately convicted of the crimes against humanity of enslavement, imprisonment, torture, rape, extermination, and other inhumane acts. These crimes should not have been subsumed into the crimes of persecution and torture."" The judge, in announcing Duch's sentence, said he took into consideration that the defendant had expressed remorse, admitted responsibility and cooperated with the court. The judge also took into account the ""coercive environment"" of the Khmer Rouge, he said . Duch pleaded guilty, but he said he was only following orders and asked for forgiveness. Last November, he asked to be freed after spending some 11 years in detention. In the last week of his trial, Duch argued that international law did not apply to him because he was following orders. The tribunal began its work in 2007 after a decade of on-and-off negotiations between the United Nations and Cambodia over the structure and functioning of the court. Duch's verdict was the court's first. Another four of the ultra-Maoist regime's former leaders are waiting to see if they will stand trial before the U.N.-backed tribunal for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Co-prosecutors filed a final submission in these cases and asked that the four be indicted and sent for trial, according to a statement from the prosecutors' office. It's not known when the court will make a decision.","Attorneys: Duch was ""a witness of the events"" and should be in witness protection .

The Pinal County deputy, who was not immediately identified, contacted authorities after being wounded in the desert, saying he had been shot by an illegal immigrant with an AK-47, said Lt. Tammy Villar, a sheriff's spokeswoman. The deputy radioed that he had encountered five men, some wielding long guns and handguns, and said they were carrying a large amount of marijuana. At one point the deputy lost radio contact with authorities, leading to a search by foot and by air for him and the shooter, according to CNN affiliate KNXV. Video from the scene shows that the deputy was located while sitting in desert brush, surrounded by cactus. He was able to walk to a helicopter that airlifted him to a hospital. A spokeswoman at Casa Grande Regional Medical Center confirmed that the deputy was being treated there Friday evening. He was in good condition with stable vital signs, conscious and comfortable, she said. KNXV: Deputy stopped five suspects . The deputy was shot in the left abdomen and suffered a superficial wound, law enforcement sources said. The search for the shooter continued into the evening. The shooting comes amid a national debate over Arizona's tough new immigration law, which allows police to demand proof of legal residency. Arizona lawmakers say the law is needed because the federal government has failed to enforce border security with Mexico, allowing more than 450,000 illegal immigrants to move into the state. KPNX: Deputy expected to survive . Pinal County is between Phoenix and Tucson and has been described as a key transit point for illegal immigrants and drug traffickers. Sheriff Paul Babeu said an estimated 80 percent of illegal immigrants pass through his county along the way to other locations. Earlier this week, a CNN crew spent 12 hours on patrol with Pinal County deputies. In that time, the deputies captured more than 50 suspected illegal immigrants and about 2,000 pounds of marijuana. Deputies in the department routinely patrol for illegal immigrants and smugglers, and it is not uncommon for them to be in the field alone, officials said. It was not immediately clear what led the deputy to engage with the shooter Friday. The shooting is sure to heat up the debate around the new Arizona law. Critics say the law is unconstitutional and will lead to racial profiling, which is illegal. But Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and others who support the law say it does not involve profiling or other illegal acts and will cut down on illegal immigration. ""Frankly this is just a very horrible story, but we should not generalize,"" Alfonso Aguilar, former chief of the U.S. Citizenship Office, told CNN's Rick Sanchez when news of Friday's shooting broke. ""We should focus on the criminality of the drug traffickers ... not scapegoat undocumented immigrants who do not pose any threat to society."" Brewer on Friday signed a bill that makes changes to the immigration law, saying the changes will ease concerns about racial profiling. The law, which will go into effect in 90 days, has already drawn at least two lawsuits and condemnation from the Mexican government and other Latin American nations. Prominent entertainers, including Shakira and Linda Ronstadt, also have spoken against the law. Some critics are calling for a boycott of Arizona, urging tourists to stay away and that no one do business with companies in the state.

"Washington (CNN) -- The thorny intersection of race and the economy topped the political agenda Wednesday as President Obama huddled with key African-American leaders at the White House. Obama held what has been dubbed an ""urban economy summit"" in the Oval Office with a group including the Rev. Al Sharpton, NAACP President Benjamin Jealous, and National Urban League President Marc Morial. National Council of Negro Women Chairwoman Dorothy Height, who is 97 years old, declined an invitation to attend due to the winter storm pounding the Washington area. The group urged Obama to spend money initially reserved for bank bailouts on areas suffering from chronically high unemployment, according to sources familiar with the attendees' plans. The investments should be ""place-based rather than race-based,"" Jealous said. The cornerstone of the civil rights leaders' plan calls for $150 billion in TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) funds to be redirected to state and local governments to hire workers to provide critical services in underserved communities. The White House has not yet proposed tapping the TARP fund for a new jobs program, with the exception of potentially using it to help expand credit lines for small businesses. The nation's first African-American president remains extremely popular among black voters. A number of African-American leaders, however, are increasingly upset with what they perceive as the federal government's inattention to the needs of economically hard-hit minority communities. ""We do not seek any special kind of edict or special kind of thing from the president because he's African-American,"" Sharpton said. But he said African-Americans do ""expect to be included in the process"" as Congress debates a new jobs bill and are seeking ""substantive change"" and not mere ""feel-good moments."" Jealous blasted what some political observers have characterized as a GOP strategy of complete opposition to Obama's agenda. The Republicans are using obstructionist ""tactics from the last century"" previously employed against African-Americans and now used ""against working people,"" he said.  ""It's not enough to say no, no, no when people ... are suffering, suffering, suffering,"" he said. ""It's not enough to just hold up progress."" While the national unemployment rate is now 9.7 percent, the jobless rate among African-Americans is hovering around 15 percent. Over 40 percent of black teenagers are unemployed, according to the National Urban League. Obama has previously argued that the administration's $862 billion stimulus package, as well as its other job growth initiatives, would benefit many of the country's hardest-hit communities. The plan presented to Obama was expected to include recommendations to: . ‚Ä¢ Expand the small business administration's Community Express Loan Program; . ‚Ä¢ Provide a stronger focus on communities with high unemployment; . ‚Ä¢ Invest $500 million for housing counselors to work with people who are delinquent on loans; . ‚Ä¢ Expand summer youth jobs programs by investing up to $7 billion to employ 5 million teenagers; . ‚Ä¢ Create 100 ""urban job academies"" to train the chronically unemployed.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two U.S. Navy MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopters arrived Saturday to assist with humanitarian and rescue efforts in flood-ravaged Pakistan, which canceled celebrations of its 63rd birthday. A statement from the U.S. State Department says the two aircraft are part of the contingent of 19 helicopters, ordered to Pakistan on Wednesday by U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. Seven of the 19 craft are now in the country. One other MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopter and four U.S. Marine Corps CH-53E helicopters arrived earlier this week. Twelve Marine CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters will arrive over the next few days. Since August 5, U.S. military helicopters have rescued more than 3,500 people and transported more than 412,000 pounds of emergency relief supplies, according to the State Department. One-fifth of Pakistan -- which is about the size of Florida -- has been flooded in relentless monsoon rains, the United Nations says. Nearly 1,400 people have died and 875,000 homes have either washed away or are damaged, according to Pakistan's Disaster Authority. Millions more are still at peril as the bloated Indus River is cresting this weekend in parts of Sindh province. In some areas, the Indus has expanded from its usual width of one mile to 12 miles. Homes, crops, trees, livestock, entire villages and towns have been transformed into vast lakes. The worst floods since Pakistan's creation have disrupted the lives of about 20 million people, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said Saturday. Surrounded by a tragedy of epic proportions, Pakistanis canceled Saturday's celebrations of independence, hard won from the British in 1947. They might have otherwise attended parades, burst firecrackers and waved the green and white flag proudly. Instead, President Asif Ali Zardari, under fire for a perceived lack of government response, toured flood-ravaged Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the north, where the crisis began more than two weeks ago. He urged Pakistanis to remember the afflicted. ""The best way to celebrate the Independence Day this year is to reach out to the victims and help them to help themselves,"" he said, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan. ""I stand with you and the people of Pakistan stand with you as well, in your hour of trial,"" he told flood victims in Seraiki. ""Do not lose hope as the entire nation stands with you."" Gilani said that even some religious events connected to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan were canceled. He said money that might have been spent on Iftar, the feast that breaks the daily fast between sunrise and sundown, should be used to alleviate suffering. Meanwhile, the United Nations said Secretary General Ban Ki-moon intends to visit Pakistan Sunday and see the devastation firsthand. His trip comes as U.N. and other humanitarian agencies are racing against time to prevent more death and suffering. ""Relief supplies must reach women, men and children as soon as possible, in order to avoid further death caused by waterborne diseases and food shortages,"" said Martin Mogwanja, the United Nations' humanitarian coordinator for Pakistan. ""The death toll has so far been relatively low compared with other major natural disasters, and we want to keep it that way,"" he said. Pakistan emergency officials predicted the second wave of floodwaters gushing down the Indus River could reach the southern town of Sukkar by Saturday evening. Hundreds of thousands of people living along the Indus could be stranded, along with the tens of thousands stranded by the first wave, said Lt. Cmdr. Jawad Khawaja of the Pakistani navy. Many residents have ignored government warnings to evacuate the area, causing a big concern, Khawaja said. ""The time to act is now -- this is a disaster of unimaginable proportions,"" said Nilofer Bakhtiar, head of the Pakistan Red Crescent Society. Thousands of flood victims huddled in sludgy camps or in jam-packed public buildings. Others slept under the stars next to the cows, sheep and goats they managed to rescue from rising waters. But when they might be able to return to dry lands at home remained a big question. Pakistan's monsoon season is only half way over and more rain is on the way.

"(CNN) -- William Adolfo Cortez -- the man suspected in four homicides in Panama, including the death of one American -- and his wife were arrested in Nicaragua on Monday, a Costa Rican official told CNN. The arrest was the conclusion of an international manhunt for the couple, whose nationality remained unconfirmed by authorities. Cortez and his wife, Jane, were on the run since the body of Cher Hughes, a native of suburban St. Louis, Missouri, was found last week on his property in Panama. The couple fled Panama to the north, traversed through Costa Rica, and were caught as they crossed the San Juan River, which acts as the boundary between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, Costa Rican Vice Minister of Public Security Jorge Chavarria said. Cortez and his wife boarded a boat and then threw the boat's driver overboard, commandeering the vessel for themselves, Chavarria said. The Nicaraguan army stopped them as they tried to enter the country. The couple was in Nicaraguan custody and was transported to a facility known as El Castillo, the vice minister said. The pair face charges of stealing a boat, but an international murder warrant out for the couple is expected to result in extradition to Panama, Chavarria said. Cortez could be American or Dutch, according to local reports, but his true nation of origin remained unconfirmed. Hughes, who was in her early 50s, was found in a shallow grave. A second body -- which has not yet been officially identified -- was found near Hughes. Panama police said they believed that Cortez's motive was to take his alleged victims' property. Hughes had lived in St. Petersburg, Florida, where she owned a neon sign business, before moving to Panama. CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","William Cortez is wanted on murder charges in Panama .

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Republicans narrowly blocked Democratic campaign finance disclosure legislation in the Senate Tuesday after raising concerns the bill would curb freedom of speech and tilt campaign spending in favor of the Democrats. A 57-41 vote fell short of the 60 votes needed for the Senate to cut off debate on the measure. Republicans unanimously opposed the measure while Democrats solidly backed it. Democrats said the legislation -- known as the DISCLOSE Act -- would bring greater transparency to campaign contributions from corporations, labor unions, and other special interests, which were able to ramp up political spending in the wake of the Supreme Court's controversial ruling in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission earlier this year. The bill would require organizations paying for political advertising to disclose the names of their top donors in the ads, similar to what now is required of political candidates for federal office. Republicans accused Democrats of trying to preserve their majorities in the House and Senate by skewing the rules in the favor of labor unions, trial lawyers, and other Democratic-leaning groups. Democrats denied that was their motive, and made certain changes to the bill last week aimed at satisfying GOP critics. The Republicans were not mollified. Democrats ""fear the righteous judgment of the American people in this coming election,"" warned Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who spearheads the Senate Republicans' election effort. ""So they're trying to change the rules in the middle of the game to suppress the speech of those who might disagree"" with them. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, slammed the bill as a ""partisan effort, pure and simple."" ""This bill is about protecting incumbent Democrats from criticism ahead of this November's election,"" he said. It's an ""all-out assault on the First Amendment."" Democrats accused Republicans of going back on their pledge to find a way to add transparency to political giving after the Citizens United ruling. They argued that without the new law, special interests will run roughshod over voters' interests. ""The Supreme Court decision was a true step backwards for this democracy,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington. ""It allowed corporations and special interest groups to spend unlimited amounts of their money influencing our democracy and it opens the door wide for foreign corporations to spend their money on elections right here in the United States."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said the bill was ""about trust and confidence in our democracy."" The measure ""asks us to put the people before the special interests,"" he argued. Let in ""the sunlight that disinfects our democracy."" Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who often votes with Democrats and who has worked on campaign finance legislation in the past, complained Democrats were resorting to ""ram and jam"" legislating in which Republicans are not invited to help craft bills and are forced to vote against measures they could have supported. ""I know it's good for politics to have a vote, but it isn't good for policy and getting it right,"" she said. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, promised that the Democratic leadership will continue to seek ways to overturn or reduce the impact of the high court's Citizens United ruling. ""This is a sad day for our democracy,"" he said. ""This fight will continue.""

"London, England (CNN) -- Former Bosnian leader Ejup Ganic will not be extradited to Serbia, a British court ruled Tuesday, setting him free. Ganic called the extradition request ""a textbook example of abuse,"" accusing the Serbian government of trying to ""undermine the judiciary in this country."" The extradition request was politically motivated, Justice Timothy Workman found in throwing it out. ""No striking or substantial new evidence"" was brought against him, the judge ruled. Ganic, who was arrested at England's Heathrow Airport in March at Serbia's request, is wanted in Serbia for conspiracy to murder in breach of the Geneva Conventions, a spokesman at Britain's Foreign Office said. Ganic's lawyer, Stephen Gentle, denied that he had any role in the 1992 killings in question. In April, Gentle said that ""the extradition request is politically motivated. It is legally flawed, and he has nothing to hide."" Ganic was the vice president of Bosnia during the civil war there between 1992 and 1995 and was twice president of the Bosnian-Croat Federation in the years following the 1995 Dayton peace agreement. Many independent commentators at the time regarded Ganic as a relative moderate in the wartime Bosnian leadership. Though Bosnian, Ganic was born in Serbia and speaks with a recognizable Serbian accent. He holds dual nationality in the former Yugoslav republics. He is leaving London for Sarajevo on Wednesday, he said.

"(CNN) -- The United States' National Transportation Safety Board said it is sending a team to help the government of Saudi Arabia investigate the crash of a Lufthansa cargo plane in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday. NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman is sending a senior air safety investigator, flight operations specialists, an aircraft systems specialist and technical advisers from the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing, according to an NTSB statement. Lufthansa Cargo said the MD-11 plane was traveling from Frankfurt, Germany, when it crashed at 11:38 a.m. (4:38 a.m. ET). Lufthansa said a team of experts from the company was on its way to Riyadh. The plane crashed while landing at King Khalid International Airport, the official Saudi Press Agency of Saudi Arabia reported. A company statement said the plane caught fire and was extensively damaged, but the blaze was extinguished. The craft had been carrying 80 tons of cargo. Lufthansa said both pilots -- who evacuated the aircraft down the emergency slide -- were injured. They were contacted by phone and were being treated in a hospital. It was not clear what freight was on the aircraft and whether customers were affected.","NEW: The cargo plane crashed while landing at Riyadh airport .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Rimrock, Arizona, were searching Monday for a 2-year-old boy who went missing over the weekend while camping with a family that was preparing to adopt him, a spokesman for the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office said. Syler Newton was last seen shortly after midnight Saturday, sleeping in a tent with the family at the Beaver Creek Campgrounds. About 1:45 a.m. Sunday, the family noticed that he was missing from his sleeping bag. About 50 people, along with bloodhounds and tracking teams, have joined in the search for Syler, who was wearing only a diaper when he disappeared, according to Yavapai County Sheriff's spokesman Dwight D'Evelyn. ""Right now, there's no indication he was taken from the site,"" D'Evelyn said Monday evening, adding that investigators are ""looking at every possible reason that Syler is missing."" D'Evelyn said bloodhounds normally used by the Department of Corrections to help find escaped felons picked up Syler's scent around the campsite Monday, but failed to detect his scent outside a particular radius. Angela Godinez, the sister of the woman preparing to adopt Syler, told CNN affiliate KPHO on Monday that the family is ""preparing for the worst."" ""We're all really, really scared, because he's only 20 pounds,"" she said. ""He could have been carried away easily. He could have froze last night or gotten heatstroke today."" ""We don't know what's going on, and there's a lot of possibilities,"" she added, her voice breaking. She said she fears that Syler is ""somewhere along the water."" The campgrounds sit on the banks of the Wet Beaver Creek. ""That's why I'm really, really scared, because he's always loved the water,"" she said. Godinez said her sister, identified by police as 36-year-old Christina Priem, is in the process of finalizing an adoption agreement with Syler's biological mother. D'Evelyn said the Department of Child Services was involved in the investigation and was working to corroborate the adoption story. FBI authorities were able to make contact with the Syler's biological mother Monday, but D'Evelyn did not know the outcome of that conversation. ""Until we speak to the biological mother, we just don't know the full story,"" D'Evelyn said. He later added that ""there's no evidence"" that the planned adoption played a role in his disappearance, ""but until we've exhausted every lead, all possibilities are being investigated.""","Syler Newton was wearing only a diaper when he disappeared early Sunday .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As airlines slash flights and cut spending in the wake of rising fuel prices, rail travel across Europe is entering into a period of renewal. Eurostar launched services from its new London station, St Pancras International in November 2007. By 2010, the continent's rail operators expect 25 million passengers to be using its high-speed networks, up from around 14 million today. And this staggering growth is expected to spill into the next decade. This week, Network Rail, the owner and operator of Britain's rail infrastructure, has commissioned a study that could lead to the biggest overhaul of the nation's rail industry since the 19th century. The study will consider five new intercity lines running north and west of London. New lines, built alongside existing tracks, could accommodate high-speed trains similar to France's TGV that travels at 186 miles per hour (300 km/h). If approved, journey times between London and Manchester could be slashed to just over one hour, and two hours between London and Glasgow. The cost of such expansion is large, says a Network Rail spokesperson, but crucial to absorb the nation's increasing demand for rail travel. Despite complaints over overcrowding and affordability of rail travel in Britain, passenger numbers have soared by 40 percent to 1.13 billion journeys a year in the last decade. And if growth continues as predicted, Network Rail expects many lines to be full by 2025. The popularity for rail is driven partly by a growing determination among passengers to become more environmentally friendly. A journey on high-speed train Eurostar between London and Paris generates one-tenth of the carbon dioxide produced by an equivalent flight, according to independent research commissioned by Eurostar. Rail's city-center-to-city-centre service is also becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to flying. Research has shown that business travelers are now willing to travel up to four hours on rail because of the increased productivity versus the airlines. Leisure travelers are prepared to go further, using trains on journeys of up to six hours. If plans for new high-speed routes across Britain are agreed, the earliest construction could begin is 2014, says Network Rail. But expansion is already underway across the European rail network to handle growing passenger numbers. Britain's first high-speed rail line was opened by Eurostar last November. This links the new St. Pancras International station in central London with Paris in just 2 hours 15 minutes and Brussels in 1 hour 51 minutes. Last June, TGV Est opened in France, slashing journey times between Paris and Reims to 45 minutes from 90 minutes, and from Paris to Strasbourg in 2 hour 20 minutes instead of 4 hours. This line opens development of a 1,500-km European railway line intended to link Paris and Bratislava via Strasbourg, Stuttgart, Munich and Vienna. Other upcoming high-speed rail routes include the HSL Zuid between Antwerp, Belgium and Amsterdam; a number of Alta Velocidad Espa√±ola (AVE) high-speed rail links between Madrid and Spain's provincial cities; and a high-speed connection between Spain and Portugal. New high-speed lines are also expected in Italy in early 2011. And if plans for a rail tunnel under the Strait of Gibraltar from Spain to Morocco are finalized, trains could link Europe and Africa by 2025. The efficiency of trans-European rail travel will be further boosted following the formation of Railteam, an alliance of high-speed rail operators across western Europe. These include Deutsche Bahn from Germany, SNCF in France, Eurostar as well as operators from Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium. At the moment making connections, for example between a Eurostar service from London to Paris and then to a TGV across France or an ICE high-speed train through Germany can be complicated. The new alliance, that works like a code-sharing airline alliance, means travelers can book tickets on a multilingual website to 100 cities, rising to 400 by 2020. The alliance will also cut waiting time between connections. And frequent business travelers will eventually be able to use a 'train mile' program across the entire network. Railteam currently does not include operators in Italy and Spain where high-speed networks are less developed. But more train operators are expected to join in the future. What's more, legislation approved by the European Union last year that requires national rail systems to open up to operators from other countries by 2010, will further push development of a European network of high-speed rail. As this network develops, and as appeal of air travel falters, riding the rails between Paris and Bratislava, or Birmingham and Brussels may not seem like such a bad idea after all.","European rail travel is having a renaissance boosted by new high-speed links .

"(CNN) -- Erin Andrews, the ESPN reporter who was secretly videotaped nude in 2008, has been receiving death threats, her attorney told CNN on Friday. Several threatening e-mails regarding Andrews have been sent to sportscaster Dan Patrick since last September, according to Marshall B. Grossman, Andrews' attorney. ""Until very recently, [the e-mails] were of a sexual nature, but then turned violent"" last month, Grossman said. He said the e-mails received in March ""are specific, they're violent, they identify the location and method of intended murder."" Grossman said the existence of the threats were first revealed to Andrews on Thursday morning. The e-mails were provided to Andrews' representatives by DirecTV, which carries the Dan Patrick Show. Patrick was formerly at ESPN. The FBI began work on the case on Thursday and believes it has identified the individual responsible for the threatening e-mails, Grossman said. Andrews is getting round-the-clock security, Grossman said. Grossman has also requested heightened security at Los Angeles' CBS Television City, where Andrews is competing on the show, ""Dancing with the Stars."" In March, a federal judge sentenced an Illinois man to two and a half years in prison for taping Andrews in the nude. The taping took place through a hotel-room peephole, and the video was posted on the Internet. Michael David Barrett, 49, pleaded guilty to a federal stalking charge in December after prosecutors accused him of altering hotel peepholes so he could shoot video of Andrews while unclothed.

"(CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron called Gaza a ""prison camp"" on Tuesday, a blunt description from a major Western leader about the besieged Palestinian territory. Cameron made the remarks in the Turkish capital of Ankara, which he was visiting to forge a new relationship with Turkey and show his support for Turkish membership in the European Union. ""Let me also be clear that the situation in Gaza has to change. Humanitarian goods and people must flow in both directions. Gaza cannot and must not be allowed to remain a prison camp,"" Cameron said, according to a transcript of the speech provided by his office. Residents of Gaza say they have suffered greatly under an Israeli goods blockade implemented since Hamas took control of the territory after elections in 2006. But Israel says its tough measures are necessary to stop weapons from reaching Hamas militants intent on destroying Israel. Ron Prosor, Israel's ambassador to Britain, reacted quickly to the prime minister's remark, saying that Hamas is responsible for the misery in Gaza. ""The people of Gaza are the prisoners of the terrorist organization Hamas,"" Prosor said in a statement. ""The situation in Gaza is the direct result of Hamas' rule and priorities."" The ambassador also raised the issue of Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier taken hostage four years ago who is being held in Gaza. ""We know that the prime minister would also share our grave concerns about our own prisoner in the Gaza Strip, Gilad Shalit, who has been held hostage there for over four years, without receiving a single Red Cross visit,"" Prosor said. Cameron's comments came in a country that once had close relations with Israel, but ties between the two nations have been strained recently over the Jewish state's policies toward the Palestinian territory. Turkey was incensed at the May 31 Israeli commando raid against an aid flotilla in the Mediterranean Sea.  Violence broke out on one of the ships in the flotilla, the Turkish Mavi Marmara, leaving nine activists -- eight Turks and a Turkish-American dual national -- dead. Cameron -- who touted Turkey's unique ability to make peace between Israel and the Arab world -- stressed that the Israeli action was ""completely unacceptable.""  He said he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Britain expects Israel's inquiry into the raid to be ""swift, transparent and rigorous."" He was also optimistic that the recently frayed alliance can continue to be friendly. ""Just as Turkey is playing a pivotal role in Afghanistan, it can also do so in the Middle East. Turkey's relationships in the region, both with Israel and the Arab world, are of incalculable value. No other country has the same potential to build understanding between Israel and the Arab world. I know that Gaza has led to real strains in Turkey's relationship with Israel, but Turkey is a friend of Israel, and I urge Turkey, and Israel, not to give up on that friendship,"" Cameron said. He also believes Turkey can also help bring together Palestinians and Israelis as they work to meet in direct negotations. ""But as, hopefully, we move in the coming weeks to direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians, so it is Turkey that can make the case for peace and Turkey that can help press the parties to come together and point the way to a just and viable solution,"" the prime minister said.","Cameron wants a new partnership with Turkey .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Military officials Tuesday identified two sailors involved in a firefight in eastern Afghanistan last week that left one of them dead and the other in the hands of the Taliban. Afghan and coalition forces recovered the remains of Petty Officer 2nd Class Justin McNeley, 30, of Wheatridge, Colorado, on Sunday, the Defense Department said.  Petty Officer 3rd Class Jarod Newlove, 25, of Renton, Washington, is listed as Duty Status Whereabouts Unknown, the Pentagon said. Newlove and McNeley were travelling in Logar province when they were attacked, the military said. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said Monday that one American died in a firefight and the other is being held by the group. Mujahid said the two Americans were driving in a civilian vehicle in the village of Dasht, in Charkh district. The Taliban wanted to take both men alive, but the firefight broke out, killing one of the Americans, Mujahid said. The other is alive and being held in a safe location, he said. Newlove's family released a statement through the Navy asking that the media release no details of the incident or information about the family. ""The information in the wrong hands could certainly jeopardize Jerod's safety and well being,"" Navy spokesman Sean Hughes said. ""The Newlove family and Navy appreciate as much privacy as possible during this difficult time which we all sincerely hope has a positive outcome."" Provincial government officials confirmed McNeley's death on Sunday. Den Mohammad Darwish, the spokesman for the governor of Logar province, said he learned from locals that the American was killed. He said the body was found in the Patanak Mountains of Charkh district. He also said the vehicle the men were driving was located Sunday. There were no immediate demands from the Taliban for the return of the Americans because the group was still deliberating what its demands would be, Mujahid said. A U.S. military official confirmed that a $20,000 reward was being offered for information leading to the return of the two sailors. Posters were being distributed in the region.

I'm used to these cameras all the time, but it's easier for me to talk about touchdowns and errors. ... This is not easy for me at all."" The legislation -- Simplifying the Ambiguous Law, Keeping Everyone Reliably Safe Act, or STALKERS -- was introduced in the House last week by Reps. Loretta Sanchez, D-California, and Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina. The ""long overdue"" bill is set for debate on the House floor Tuesday, Sanchez said. Stalking laws have not caught up with emerging technology, she said, and the bill will bring the laws into the present ""to give law enforcement the tools they need to combat stalking in the digital age."" The legislation would cover technologies such as electronic monitoring, spyware, bugging and video surveillance, she said. A victim presently must have a ""reasonable fear of physical injury"" before a case can be prosecuted, she said, and sometimes that is too late. ""The bottom line: Stalking is about power and control,"" she said. ""It's a violation of the worst kind, and we need to put a law in place in our justice system that helps us and gives us every available tool."" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, said she plans to introduce a companion bill in the Senate and is procuring a Republican author. A former prosecutor, Klobuchar said that although stalking is ""one of the most invasive crimes,"" it can be difficult to prove and tricky to prosecute. She thanked Andrews for coming forward but noted, ""there are cases like this all over the country every day"" involving women who are not in the public eye. She recalled a case in Minnesota in which an online relationship soured and a man posted pictures of a woman's children, along with their full names, addresses and telephone number, on child pornography sites, encouraging people to molest them. In March, a federal judge sentenced an Illinois man to 2 1/2 years in prison for taping Andrews in the nude through the peephole and posting the video on the Internet. Michael David Barrett, 49, pleaded guilty to a federal stalking charge in December after prosecutors accused him of altering hotel peepholes so he could shoot video of Andrews. ""I have seen with my own eyes through firsthand experience that the laws have been taken way too lightly. They aren't clear, and they have not kept up with the technology or the time,"" Andrews said, her voice shaking at times. ""At times over the past year, I have screamed. I have cried. I have said to my family, 'Why me? Why is this happening to me?' "" But, she said, she received ""countless letters -- I'm still receiving them -- from women who say, 'Please go out and fight this. Please go out and show your face.' ... I'm showing my face. I'm lending my voice. And I'm here to give this law some teeth."" She said her message to victims is, ""There is hope, and there is help, and if you need help, do not be ashamed to ask for it."" The legislation increases penalties for offenses where a restraining order is in place and for offenses involving children or the elderly, lawmakers said. Currently, the federal law applies only to criminals who travel over state lines, but the new legislation will cover any conduct that criminals engage in that affects interstate commerce, Sanchez and Klobuchar said. Although most stalking cases are prosecuted at the state level, the federal law will serve as a model, they said.","Reporter joins lawmakers to support legislation .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN)  -- A passenger plane crashed into a shallow waterway and broke in two after overshooting the runway in a remote area of Indonesia's eastern Papua province on Tuesday, injuring 78 people on board. Bambang Ervan, a spokesman for Indonesia's Transportation Ministry, said  investigators to the airport in  the coastal town of Manokwari where the Merpati Nusantara Airlines Boeing 737-300 had been attempting to land. There were reports that bad weather may have been a factor. The injured, many of whom suffered fractures, were taken to hospitals in the area. In all, the plane was carrying 103 passengers, including three children and three infants. Ervan said the aircraft bounced on the runway during landing, skidded and plunged into a nearby canal. Merpati, a cash-strapped state-owned airline which is in the process of upgrading its aging fleet, flies many of the more remote routes across Indonesia. Last year Merpati suffered two plane crashes in Papua. In July, a Merpati flight lost its front wheels as it took of from the town of Biak. A month later, another flight -- a Twin Otter aircraft -- crashed, killing 16 people on board. Air accidents are not infrequent in Papua, a mountainous area in the easternmost part of Indonesia. Two cargo planes and several smaller aircraft also crashed in the province last year. Indonesia has made efforts in recent years to improve its safety record. Last year the European Union's Safety Commission lifted a ban on four Indonesian carriers. In Hong Kong, Tuesday, a Cathy Pacific flight from Surabaya in Indonesia made an emergency landing injuring eight people. Flight 780 from Surabaya, Indonesia, was carrying 309 passengers and 13 crew members, Cathay Pacific CEO Tony Tyler said at a news conference. Passengers and crew deplaned through the Airbus 330's evacuation slides. The injured were taken to the territory's Princess Margaret Hospital. Tyler said a full investigation will follow but engine trouble may have played a part in the incident. The north runway at the Hong Kong International Airport was closed for almost three hours after the emergency landing.","Merpati airlines jet crashes into canal after skidding on landing in Papua .

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- The deep-rooted Spanish tradition of bullfighting is under fire in Barcelona and its region of Catalonia, where the regional parliament will vote on Wednesday whether to ban the fights. If approved, Catalonia would become the first region in mainland Spain to outlaw bullfighting, and some see it as a slap in the face to the rest of the country. Enrique Guillen, 24, laments that he might be the last Barcelona-born bullfighter to take the ""alternativa,"" or ceremonial fight in the ring against the biggest bulls to become a full-fledged matador, which he did last year at Barcelona's sole remaining bullring, the Monumental. Guillen's father worked at the bullring, opening the doors for bulls to charge in to face matadors and their death. ""My father brought me to see the bullfights when I still had a pacifier,"" Guillen said. ""It would be frustrating not to be able to give to my children what my parents gave to me."" But activist Aida Gascon, of the Anti-Bullfighting Party, known as PACMA, looks beyond the tradition and sees animal cruelty. She says she's attended just one bullfight in her life, and that was only to get a sense of the bull's suffering, which she depicted in a painting that hangs in her living room. ""Bullfighting is part of Spanish culture,"" Gascon said. ""But that should change. Many traditions disappear as the society advances."" The number of bullfights across Spain has dropped by one-third in recent years, due mostly to budget constraints of local governments, which often fund the spectacles. In Catalonia, there are now just over a dozen fights a year and the Monumental bullring in Barcelona is about the only place in the region that still holds fights. But Luis Corrales and his pro-bullfight group, known as PPDF, released a study predicting big economic losses for Catalonia if bullfighting is banned. This would mainly result, he says, because the Catalan government would have to pay damages to the bullfighting industry, which holds long-term operating licenses. ""When the Catalan government and the opposition are working hard to trim the budget, how could they justify making big indemnity payments to the bullfighting industry, when it's not necessary,"" Corrales said. But critics disagree, saying the economic impact would be minimal, given the small number of fights still held in Catalonia. Either way, the Catalan parliament bullfight vote is being watched not only in Spain, but abroad, where many have a fascination with bullfighting. The proposal to ban bullfighting started as a popular initiative in Catalonia and was accepted for consideration by parliament last year by a slim margin of votes. Since then, there has been an ever-intensifying debate, with bullfighting proponents and opponents gathering support from across Spain, even from abroad. Most analysts predict that the vote on Wednesday will be very close. The two largest parties in parliament, the ruling Socialists and the opposition Catalan nationalists, or CiU, have given their members of parliament freedom to vote their conscience. Some smaller parties on the left are expected to vote for the ban while the conservative Popular Party is expected to support continuing the tradition. The ban, if approved, would take effect in January 2012 and would not end bullfighting in the rest of Spain. It still has a strong following in Madrid and in the south around Seville. Spain's Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean already does not allow bullfighting, but a ban in Catalonia would be considered a bigger blow to the tradition. Some analysts say that Catalan nationalism, including the desire by some in the Barcelona area for independence from Spain, also is playing a role in the vote, as well as the upcoming regional elections for parliament later this year. But the main bullfighting proponents and opponents say the root issue is a clear line in the sand: tradition vs. protection of animals. The Catalan parliament vote is expected by 1 p.m. (7 a.m. ET) Wednesday.","Catalonia would become the first region of mainland Spain to ban bullfights .

"Washington (CNN) -- The September 11, 2001, attacks have led to an intelligence community so large and unwieldy that it's unmanageable and inefficient -- and no one knows how much it costs, according to a two-year investigation by the Washington Post. Ahead of the publication, many in the intelligence community worried that the stories would disclose too much information about contractors and the classified tasks they handle. The Post article that appeared in Monday's edition says its investigation uncovered ""a Top Secret America hidden from public view and lacking in thorough oversight. After nine years of unprecedented spending and growth, the result is that the system put in place to keep the United States safe is so massive that its effectiveness is impossible to determine."" Washington Post:  Top Secret America . The Post investigation found that ""33 building complexes for top-secret intelligence work are under construction or have been built since September 2001,"" or the equivalent of nearly three Pentagons. ""Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism, homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States,"" according to the Post, which added that an estimated 854,000 people hold top-secret security clearances. ""There has been so much growth since 9/11 that getting your arms around that -- not just for the DNI [director of national intelligence], but for any individual, for the director of the CIA, for the secretary of defense -- is a challenge,"" Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the Post last week. ""Look, we know the intelligence community grew significantly and quickly after 9/11,"" a senior administration official told CNN Monday. ""Some of it was inefficient. But we are looking at those inefficiencies. And remember, we have prevented attacks."" Acting National Intelligence Director David Gompert issued a statement saying the Post's report ""does not reflect the intelligence community we know."" ""In recent years, we have reformed the (intelligence community) in ways that have improved the quality, quantity, regularity, and speed of our support to policymakers, warfighters, and homeland defenders, and we will continue our reform efforts,"" he said. ""We provide oversight, while also encouraging initiative. We work constantly to reduce inefficiencies and redundancies, while preserving a degree of intentional overlap among agencies to strengthen analysis, challenge conventional thinking, and eliminate single points of failure."" The Post said its investigation was ""based on government documents and contracts, job descriptions, property records, corporate and social networking Web sites, additional records, and hundreds of interviews with intelligence, military and corporate officials and former officials,"" most of whom requested anonymity. Although officials were concerned about the content of the newspaper articles ahead of publication, what troubled them the most was ""interactive"" component of the series, which they said lists the locations where the CIA, the National Security Agency and the other agencies that make up the intelligence community have facilities. Many of those sites are not publicly known, some officials said. Officials worried about the security implications of such disclosures. As one person put it, ""these are targeted places to begin with. ... Mapping it out presents counterterrorism and counterintelligence concerns."" The officials say there have been discussions with the Washington Post to make changes in the website. It was not immediately known what, if any, changes were made, but an interactive map available Monday morning showed more than 2,000 government work locations and nearly 7,000 for private contractors. In two communications, officials asked the Post not to publish addresses, the senior administration official said Monday. There has been talk in Washington for some time that the Post was working on an investigative series on the intelligence community. But it's only been in recent days that the deep concern of the intelligence officials has become more apparent. The newspaper said it took steps to allay public safety concerns. ""Because of the nature of this project, we allowed government officials to see the Web site several months ago and asked them to tell us of any specific concerns. They offered none at that time,"" the Post said in a message posted on its website. ""As the project evolved, we shared the Web site's revised capabilities. Again, we asked for specific concerns. One government body objected to certain data points on the site and explained why; we removed those items. Another agency objected that the entire Web site could pose a national security risk but declined to offer specific comments."" The message from the Mission Support Center of the director of national intelligence that was obtained by CNN told contractors, ""Employees should be reminded that they must neither confirm nor deny information contained in this, or any, media publication."" It warned that foreign intelligence services, terrorist groups and ""criminal elements"" might want to use the information. ""Specifically, we recommend that companies affected by this publication and website assess and take steps to mitigate risk to their workforce, facility and mission,"" including ""re-enforcement of security and counterintelligence protections and steps to enhance workforce awareness."" Similar messages from the military and other agencies also went out. CNN's Pam Benson, Barbara Starr, Tom Cohen, Alan Silverleib and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","NEW: Acting national intelligence director insists there has been major reform .

"(CNN) -- A Georgia family whose daughter was killed is battling to get her 9-month-old child back from state custody in New York, where her estranged husband left the baby with relatives after her slaying. Corrissa Friends, 21, was shot to death in her apartment in the Atlanta suburb of Riverdale, Georgia, on August 11, according to police. Her husband, Wisdom Jeffrey, is wanted in connection with her death and is now a fugitive, Riverdale Police Chief Samuel Patterson said. Patterson said he believed Casey had been returned to the family by now. But Corey Friends, the slain woman's uncle, told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" that the girl, ""as far as I know, is in the state custody of New York."" ""We are currently trying as hard as possible to get Casey back in the custody of my family,"" he said. He said the family had received an outpouring of support from friends in the Atlanta area, ""and hopefully we can catch this guy and draw some kind of closure to this crazy situation."" Patterson said Corrissa Friends had moved several times around the Atlanta area to get away from Jeffrey, and that police had been called to the apartment about a domestic dispute the day before the killing. Officers found no evidence of violence at the apartment, and Jeffrey was not arrested. But because Jeffrey's name was not on the lease, they told him to leave at Friends' request, Patterson said. Early the next morning, Patterson said, Jeffrey returned to the apartment and shot Corrissa three times with a shotgun -- twice from the front, once from behind. She was able to call 911, but died before an ambulance arrived, the chief said. He said witnesses put Jeffrey at the apartment less than five minutes before the shooting, and police recovered the shotgun used in the killing at the scene. He said he expected Casey would be back with her maternal grandparents, but, ""The wheels of justice sometimes move a little slowly from our perspective."" ""It should have happened yesterday or the day before,"" Patterson said.","Corrissa Friends was shot to death August 11 .

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain is facing an increasing threat from lone home-grown terrorists, especially among radicalized Muslims in the prison system, a report from a security think tank said Friday. There is the potential for a ""new wave"" of terrorism in Britain that is shifting from large-scale bombings requiring considerable amounts of training and operational support toward lone individuals carrying out attacks on a smaller scale, according to the report from the Royal United Services Institute. ""Rather than sending out trained 'cell leaders' to conduct preparation for sophisticated operations, AQAP (al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) and other related organizations have recently been content to send out a higher number of lone individuals (or at least lightly supported ones) whose chances of success are considerably lower, but whose number and presence raise similar public anxieties,"" the report said. ""Eventually, it is reasoned, one of them will be lucky enough to succeed in a major way against high-profile targets in Western countries."" One trend contributing to the ""new wave"" of terrorism is the escalating rate of radicalization of Muslims in the British prison system, which the report says may produce as many as 800 ""potentially violent radicals."" ""Jihadist radicalization is believed by the prison authorities to be taking place at a rapid rate, especially in the eight high-security institutions where most terrorist prisoners are kept,"" the report said. Prison probation officers believe that around one in ten of the 8,000 Muslim prisoners in high-security institutions in England and Wales are successfully targeted, the report said. These prisoners were not previously convicted of terrorism offenses, it said. ""The prison chaplaincy, including its Muslim adviser, told a parliamentary committee last year that the situation was becoming progressively worse,"" the report said. ""It remains to be seen how much of this 'new radicalism' may find actual expression in violent acts or attempts at recruitment."" The use of more lone individuals in carrying out attacks can be seen in the case of Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, suspected in the failed bombing of a Detroit-bound passenger plane on Christmas Day last year, the report said. The U.S. Treasury Department last month designated al-Awlaki a key leader for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and he is believed to be hiding in Yemen. The report also cited the failed Times Square bombing May 1 in New York, to which 30-year-old Pakistani-American Faisal Shahzad has pleaded guilty. ""This new breed of jihadists have only tenuous links to any major terrorist organisation and receive little training and few resources, increasing the difficulty for the police and intelligence services in tracking and intercepting them,"" the report said.","Prison radicalization may produce as many as 800 new offenders, the report says .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A coroner's investigator dismissed online speculation that the pneumonia deaths of actress Brittany Murphy and her husband, Simon Monjack, may both have been related to viral mold inside their Los Angeles home. ""There were no indicators that it was from mold,"" Los Angeles County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said Monday. Murphy, 32, and Monjack, 39, died five months apart in the same bedroom of the home they shared with the actress' mother, Sharon Murphy, in Hollywood Hills. The preliminary autopsy concluded that Monjack's death May 23 was caused by acute pneumonia and severe anemia, ""just like Brittany,"" Winter said last week. Murphy died December 20 from a combination of pneumonia, an iron deficiency and multiple drug intoxication, a coroner said. The drugs involved were legal and are used to treat respiratory infections, according to an autopsy. Winter said Monjack, his mother-in-law and their lawyer all talked to him about a possible mold problem in the home during the investigation into Brittany's death. Murphy, however, issued a statement Monday saying that she has ""never been personally asked by the Coroner or anyone from the Health Department to come and inspect my home for mold."" Winter called that ""an absolute lie,"" but Murphy's publicist, Roger Neal, stood by the statement, calling it ""100 percent factual."" The home apparently was tested by ""a well-respected company"" for dangerous mold just two months before Murphy's death, according to Neal. ""Simon Monjack received the report and assured Brittany and Sharon Murphy that there was no mold danger and it was safe to stay in the house,"" Neal said. Monjack, a British screenwriter, married Murphy in 2007. She was an often bubbly, free-spirited actress who appeared in films such as ""Clueless,"" ""8 Mile,"" ""Don't Say a Word"" and ""Girl, Interrupted."" She also lent her voice to animated works, including the movie ""Happy Feet"" -- in which she also sang -- and a regular role on the animated TV series ""King of the Hill.""","NEW: Inspection found no mold in home before Murphy's death .

"(CNN) -- A worker was paid for 12 years without ever showing up for work at a Norfolk, Virginia, agency funded by federal, state and local money, officials say. Norfolk Mayor Paul Fraim told CNN on Friday that when a new director took over at Norfolk Community Services Board recently, she was ""doing her due diligence"" when she discovered the hooky-playing employee was on the books. The director, Maureen Womack, then notified the city attorney's office, Fraim said. Sandy Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Community Services Board, told CNN Friday that her agency couldn't comment because of the ongoing investigation. On behalf of the city attorney's office, Norfolk city spokeswoman Terry Bishirjian referred to a statement released on Wednesday that said, ""The city attorney's office, with the approval of Womack, took appropriate steps to prevent any further payments to the employee and the employee was terminated."" It added, ""The city attorney has undertaken a detailed investigation of the circumstances and history of this matter to determine what further personnel actions should be taken, and the board of the NCSB passed unanimous motions supporting the executive director in any further employment actions she might take on the advice of counsel. After all necessary employment actions are taken, the city attorney will turn the matter over to Norfolk's Department of Police for further investigation."" CNN affiliate WAVY said that the employee, a woman whose name was not released, ""earned"" somewhere between $300,000 and $480,000, not including full benefits, from the board over the past dozen years. The Norfolk board is partially funded by the Virginia state Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services. According to the department's website, it is one of 40 locally run community services boards that ""serve children and adults who have -- or who are at risk of -- mental illness, serious emotional disturbance, intellectual disabilities, or substance use disorders."" The mayor said state law requires cities, towns and counties throughout Virginia to host the boards, but each city has little involvement beyond providing some of the funding for the offices. ""This is not a city employee. She does not work for the city, does not get a city check,"" Fraim said. He added that while the Norfolk City Council appoints members to the Community Services Board, the board hires its own director and is autonomous and independent. The city of Norfolk provides just under $4 million of the local board's budget a year, Fraim said. Meghan McGuire, a spokeswoman for the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, said the state pays $9.7 million annually and the federal government usually contributes $2.4 million, but this year added $190,000 in stimulus funds. Fraim expressed concerns about a lack of oversight at the agency. The Norfolk Community Services Board is a ""quasi-federal, state and local agency that operates independently,"" he said. ""No one really judges their performance, if you will. It's not a good model."" McGuire said there is some state oversight. Each board is required to commission an independent annual audit, then send a copy of that audit to the state. A state auditor then looks for red flags and prioritizes the reports by risk level, she said. ""Recent audits of Norfolk showed low risk and no need for our department to conduct our own audit,"" McGuire said. ""We don't have an employee-employer relationship with them, but if we do find out about a situation or something that needs to be investigated ... we can investigate through our internal audit process."" Norfolk City Councilman Barclay C. Winn commented on the situation Friday, saying, ""We could have and should have done more in this case, but I think when you get an audited financial statement at the end of the year and a clean opinion, it gives you some level of comfort."" He added that government at all levels, including his, needs to be held accountable. ""I'm sure the mayor and city manager will get to the bottom of it, [but] the buck stops with the city council,"" Winn said. ""If it has the word 'Norfolk' in it, it stops with us. ... That's OK. That's part of the job."" McGuire said that while the state does not have authority over personnel issues, it does have authority over policy and procedure, and when the state makes recommendations for change in those areas, ""If they don't make changes, we can take some action. In the worst case, we can withhold some state funds."" But that withholding of cash seems unlikely in this case. McGuire said that ""it appears CSB is working diligently to resolve this issue."" George Pratt was the Norfolk board's executive director for 12 years, with a short gap between his and Womack's tenure. Even though his time in charge overlapped with the alleged shirker for about a decade, Pratt told CNN on Friday, ""I know nothing about it. I read it in the paper."" Pratt added that no one had called him to ask about the situation and that ""whatever the investigation is, they have not informed me of any details."" When McGuire was asked how a person who got paid for not working could have escaped detection for so long, she said she was unsure. ""We don't know at this point how something like this can happen. We're very concerned,"" she said. ""[We're] working on procedure to prevent this from happening again."" Norfolk's newest city councilman, Tommy Smigiel, told CNN Friday that ""people want accountability."" Smigiel said that when he recently met with a city auditor, he was told about a shelved proposal that predated him, calling for a hotline that Norfolk city workers -- and workers at Norfolk-affiliated agencies such as Community Services Board -- could call confidentially to report fraud or any other ethical issues. He said the city council has now ""technically endorsed"" the idea and is working on an ordinance to implement the plan, with the hope that such a fix ""probably would have caught something like this.""","A woman who worked at a government-funded agency didn't show up for 12 years .

"(CNN) -- Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin responded angrily on her Facebook page Friday to a verbal attack by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka where he called her a ""crazy magnet."" ""I'm not sure why he's attacking my record when I'm not the one responsible for  the policies resulting in continued mass unemployment and a weak economy,"" Palin shot back. ""Among my 'crimes,' the union boss cited the fact that I sometimes write notes on  my hand (guilty as charged!); that I appear on cable television every once in a  while to comment on the news (it's called the First Amendment, Rich); and that  my common sense conservatism makes him laugh."" Trumka released the text of the speech before he gave it on Thursday at his organization's convention in Alaska. In it he complains that every time Democrats have proposed jobs legislation they have been blocked by ""the most politically motivated Republican minority we have ever seen -- and I really do mean ever... Then he asks, ""What is this crazy magnet that's pulling people to the right? I mean, look at your former governor...""

"(CNN) -- The mother of a 4-year-old girl snatched from the front yard of her small-town Missouri home tried to chase after her daughter's abductor, a neighbor said Tuesday. Alisa Maier was kidnapped Monday evening in Louisiana, Missouri, while she was playing with her brother, police there said. Appearing at a news conference Tuesday morning, grandfather Roy Harrison told reporters, ""I want this baby back."" ""Please, anybody, if you know anything, call this guy back here,"" he said, pointing to Louisiana Police Chief Richard Hughes. ""Call the FBI. Call whoever you need to call."" Anita McKlevis, who lives across the street from the family, said Alisa's mother was ""just beside herself"" and tried to pursue the man who abducted the girl. ""She jumped up and went across the street, got into her van and took off,"" McKlevis told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell."" She said the children were regularly supervised by parents or grandparents while playing outside: ""I never seen this little girl without her parents,"" McKlevis added. Louisiana is about 80 miles north of St. Louis. Michael Kaste, an agent from the FBI's St. Louis office, said between 75 and 100 law enforcement officers -- including about 30 FBI agents -- and about 50 volunteers were taking part in the search. Investigators are also questioning known sex offenders about the girl's abduction, he said. ""We're going to interview anybody we think could be involved in this,"" Kaste said. Alisa was wearing a white T-shirt and denim shorts when she was taken. Hughes said investigators in Louisiana, about 80 miles north of St. Louis, have no indication that her kidnapping was anything other than a random abduction. Police are examining surveillance video from local businesses in hopes of finding some sign of the abductor, a man of indeterminate age who drove off in a dark-colored sedan with front-end damage, Hughes said. The town of about 4,000 is located just across the Mississippi River from Illinois, where state and county authorities are also involved in the search, he said. ""Ultimately, our goal is to bring her back here to her family,"" Hughes said. Harrison called her ""a really good girl, always smiling, happy-go-lucky.

"(CNN) -- Police in Collierville, Tennessee, are investigating the disappearance of a former professional basketball player and say ""there is a high level of concern"" in the search to find him. Lorenzen Wright, 34, who played 13 seasons in the NBA, has not been seen or heard from since July 18 when he visited his ex-wife and their children in Collierville, near Memphis, investigators said. Collierville police spokesman Mark Heuberger told CNN that Wright's mother reported him missing on July 22. ""We're taking it very, very seriously,"" Heuberger said, ""and there is a high level of concern."" ""His mom made the report because she felt it was unusual that he did not contact his children for an extended period of time, that's what made her prompt to contact the police,"" he added. ""This is not like him,"" Wright's sister, Savia Archie, told CNN Tuesday. ""I haven't talked to my brother in nine days. He doesn't go without talking to family. ""I'm trying to keep my faith in the world and that he's not in trouble and hopefully he will come home. He's my big brother. Without him, there's no me."" Heuberger cautioned that there is no indication that Wright was the victim of a crime. ""A red flag has not come up yet, at least (as) of today, that suggests any harm has come to him,"" Heuberger said Tuesday . ""Our detectives have talked to a lot of people -- former coaches, players, sports agents -- and continue to follow leads given by the public,"" Heuberger said, ""and we're working very close to the family."" Archie, Wright's sister, described her brother as a loving son, father and uncle. ""My sister had a baby shower last Sunday and he was supposed to come,"" she said. ""Something had to have happened."" The 6-foot-11-inch Wright, who lives in Atlanta, was a forward/center for several teams during his professional basketball career. He played with the Los Angeles Clippers, Atlanta Hawks, Memphis Grizzlies and Sacramento Kings. He was with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2008-2009, his last year in the NBA. Wright, who has six children, completed his degree at the University of Memphis in 2003, according to the official NBA website.

"Goma, Democratic Republic Of The Congo (CNN) -- The Rwandan military and an allied rebel group massacred ethnic Hutus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the aftermath of genocide in Rwanda, says a leaked draft report commissioned by the United Nations. The report states that it is not making a definitive conclusion on whether the slayings in Congo amounted to genocide, and that a competent judiciary would have to try the cases. Commissioned by the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, the report says ""tens of thousands"" of Hutu civilians were slaughtered with knives, bludgeoned with hammers and burned alive as the Rwandan army and the Allied Democratic Liberation Forces swept across Congo -- then called Zaire -- leading to the toppling of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. The report, titled ""Mapping Exercise,"" documents crimes against humanity throughout the Congo between 1993 and 2003. The Rwandan government blasted the report as ""malicious, offensive and ridiculous."" ""It is immoral and unacceptable that the United Nations, an organization that failed outright to prevent genocide in Rwanda and the subsequent refugees crisis [and] is the direct cause for so much suffering in Congo and Rwanda, now accuses the army that stopped the genocide ... in the Democratic Republic of Congo,"" government spokesman Ben Rutsinga said in a statement. The final version of the report will be officially published Monday. Its most controversial parts are accusations against the Rwandan government of ""systematic attacks, in particular, killings and massacres perpetrated against members of the Hutu ethnic group."" ""There is no denying that ethnic massacres were committed and that the victims were mostly Hutus from Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire,"" the report states. ""The joint mission's preliminary opinion is that some of these alleged massacres could constitute acts of genocide."" It adds, ""The majority of the victims were children, women, elderly people and the sick, who posed no threat to the attacking forces."" The Rwandan government said the report's ""extremely serious allegations""  are ""based on questionable methodology, sourcing and shockingly low standard of proof."" ""Given the gravity of its mission, the Mapping Team's failure to consult with Rwanda even though they found time to meet with over 200 [non-governmental] representatives is shocking and shows complete disregard for fundamental fairness,"" Rutsinga said. More than 1 million Rwandans fled to neighboring eastern Congo when the Rwandan genocide ended in 1994 -- most of them Hutu. In 1996, Rwanda invaded Congo in pursuit of the genocide orchestrators, who were living amid hundreds of thousands of other refugees. The stated goal of Rwanda during that time was to end the refugee crisis in eastern Congo. But the United Nations report says that the Rwandan military did not discriminate between fugitives and refugees, nor did it discriminate by age or gender. ""The majority of the incidents reported indicate that the Hutus were targeted as such, with no discrimination between them,"" the report says. ""The numerous attacks against the Hutus in Zaire, who were not part of the refugees, seem to confirm that it was all Hutus, as such."" The report says people who convinced soldiers that they were Tutsi were let go, while the Hutus were massacred. ""People who were able to persuade the aggressors that they belonged to another ethnic group were released just before the massacres,"" the report says. The report says tens of thousands of Hutus were massacred in particular areas with an intent to commit genocide. ""Even if only a part of the Hutu population in Zaire was targeted and destroyed, it could nonetheless constitute a crime of genocide, if this was the intention of the perpetrators,"" the report says. Although independent researchers have documented the crimes against humanity committed by the Rwandan government, the United Nations report is the most official and forthcoming accusation made so far. Rwanda indicated that it could withdraw from U.N. peacekeeping operations if the report is published. The country is a major contributor to the peacekeeping force in Darfur, and has sent troops to Haiti. The report is publicly humiliating for recently re-elected President Paul Kagame, who earned praise for helping heal Rwanda after the genocide. In recent years, the nation has developed dramatically, with a reputation as one of the safest, cleanest, least-corrupt and most organized countries in Africa. The fallout of the scathing report is unclear, but it is sure to have an impact. Rwanda's reconciliation policy is governed by anti-genocide laws that human rights organizations have called intentionally vague. The laws make it virtually impossible to accuse the Rwandan government of human rights violations, crimes against humanity or war crimes. Accusing Rwanda of crimes against humanity committed in the Congo would break those laws. In April, presidential aspirant Victoire Ingabire was arrested in Kigali for saying that Hutus were killed by the Rwandan government, both in Rwanda and in neighboring Congo. Ingabire was charged with 'genocide ideology' for those comments, and could face up to 25 years in prison. Her American lawyer was arrested on similar charges, but was later released. Col. Patrick Karegeya, who was a senior member of the Rwandan army and a key actor in the wars in the Congo before fleeing to South Africa in 2008, said Rwanda never set out to commit genocide against the Hutu, but war crimes were committed. ""Civilians died, politicians died,"" Karegeya said earlier this month before Rwanda's presidential election. ""They died in the Congo, they died in other places.""","NEW: Rwanda slams the report as unfair and immoral .

"(CNN) -- Since the time of Nicolaus Copernicus five centuries ago, people have wondered whether there are other planets like Earth in the universe. Today scientists are closer than ever to an answer -- and it appears to be that the Milky Way galaxy is rich in Earth-sized planets, according to astronomer Dimitar Sasselov. Drawing on new findings from a NASA telescope, he told the TED Global conference in Oxford, England earlier this month that nearly 150 Earth-sized planets have been detected so far. He estimated that the overall number of planets in the galaxy with ""similar conditions to the conditions that we experience here on Earth is pretty staggering. It's about 100 million such planets."" A Bulgarian-born scientist with Ph.D.s in astronomy and physics, Sasselov is a professor of astronomy and director of the Harvard Origins of Life Initiative, which brings together scientists from many disciplines to explore how life began. He titled his talk at the Oxford conference: ""On Completing the Copernican Revolution."" Until technology was developed to detect planets outside the solar system 15 years ago, scientists were only able to speculate about the existence of Earth-like planets. The new technology paid off in the discovery of some 500 planets. The disappointing fact though was that very few of the newly identified planets were the size of Earth. ""There was of course an explanation for it. We only see the big planets. So that's why most of those planets are really in the category of 'like Jupiter,' "" he said. Read more about Dimitar Sasselov on TED.com . There was no indication that these large planets were suitable for life to begin. ""We were still back where Copernicus was. We didn't have any evidence whether planets like the Earth are out there,"" Sasselov said. ""And we do care about planets like the Earth because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate, to emerge, to survive. And we didn't have the evidence for that."" In March 2009, NASA launched Kepler, a telescope-carrying satellite that can detect the dimming of light caused by a planet orbiting around a star. ""All the stars for Kepler are just points of light,"" Sasselov said. ""But we learn a lot from that, not only that there is a planet there, but we also learn its size. How much of the light is being dimmed depends on how big the planet is. We learn about its orbit, the period of its orbit and so on."" The discovery of many potential planets means ""we can go and study them -- remotely, of course -- with all the techniques that we already have tested in the past five years. We can find what they're made of, would their atmospheres have water, carbon dioxide, methane."" At the same time, Sasselov believes, scientists can make progress in the laboratory on better understanding how chemicals can produce life. ""And in one of our labs, Jack Szostak's labs, it was a series of experiments in the last four years that showed that the environments -- which are very common on planets, on certain types of planets like the Earth --  where you have some liquid water and some clays, you actually end up with naturally available molecules which spontaneously form bubbles. But those bubbles have membranes very similar to the membrane of every cell of every living thing on Earth. .... And they really help molecules, like nucleic acids, like RNA and DNA, stay inside, develop, change, divide and do some of the processes that we call life."" Copernicus is famous for the then-revolutionary idea that the Earth orbits the sun rather than that the universe is centered around Earth. But Sasselov pointed out that with the Copernican revolution came a humbling sense of mankind's insignificance in the universe. ""You've all learned that in school -- how small the Earth is compared to the immense universe. And the bigger the telescope, the bigger that universe becomes. ... So in space, the Earth is very small. To demonstrate the minuteness of life on Earth, Sasselov took off his tie. ""Can you imagine how small it is? Let me try it. OK, let's say this is the size of the observable universe, with all the galaxies, with all the stars. Do you know what the size of life in this necktie will be? ""It will be the size of a single, small atom. It is unimaginably small. ... But that's not the whole story, you see."" The other dimension of life on Earth is time -- and life has existed for a good portion, nearly a third, of the time the universe is believed to have existed, Sasselov said. ""This is not insignificant. This is very significant. So life might be insignificant in size, but it is not insignificant in time. Life and the universe compare to each other like a child and a parent, parent and offspring. ""So what does this tell us? This tells us that that insignificance paradigm that we somehow got to learn from the Copernican principle, it's all wrong. There is immense, powerful, potential in life in this universe -- especially now that we know that places like the Earth are common. And that potential, that powerful potential, is also our potential, of you and me. ""And if we are to be stewards of our planet Earth and its biosphere, we better understand the cosmic significance and do something about it. And the good news is we can actually indeed do it. ""","Dimitar Sasselov: Earth-sized planets are plentiful in the galaxy .
He says planets of such size are suited for the chemical processes that can produce life .
Sasselov says biologists are finding clues to origin of life in laboratories .
He says Earth life is notably old, representing nearly a third of age of universe ."
"(CNN)  -- In less than a month, Pastor Terry Jones of the Dove World Outreach Center in Florida plans to host ""Burn a Quran Day"" to mark the ninth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The pastor, author of the book ""Islam is of the Devil,"" is using the burning to urge American Christians to ""stand up"" to what he describes as a monolithic Muslim threat. A Facebook page for the event has accrued thousands of ""likes"" and Jones has said people have been mailing him Qurans to burn. As a Muslim scholar, an adherent of one of the Abrahamic faiths -- Judaism, Christianity and Islam -- and as someone committed to interfaith understanding, I urge Jones to cancel this event. Not only are the actions of Jones contrary to the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, but they are also against the ideals of the American Founding Fathers. The planned burning has already caused alarm in the Muslim world, with the pre-eminent Sunni university, Al-Azhar in Cairo, Egypt, condemning it as ""stirring up hate and discrimination."" At a recent dinner in Washington, a host for one of Pakistan's top TV channels confided in me that he ""didn't dare"" report the story because if he did, ""not a single American would be safe in Pakistan."" He and the cameraman were quivering with anger as they asked me to explain why Americans hated Islam. I tried my best to explain this was not the case, but Jones' burning will have great symbolic significance to a Muslim world already feeling under attack by the United States. It will cause undue harm to U.S. relations with the Muslim world and particularly the war effort. Gen. David Petraeus, the head of American forces in Afghanistan, has repeatedly expressed the need for winning the ""hearts and minds"" of local people by treating them with dignity and respect. When Afghans see that their holy book is being burned, it will cause riots and attacks that will put U.S. troops further at risk. There will be similar riots and attacks in neighboring Pakistan and Iran. It will inflame the entire Muslim world and fuel acts of terrorism. It could also inflame anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States, especially in the context of the anger over the proposed Islamic center near ground zero in Lower Manhattan. Many American Muslims will feel as if they are second-class citizens and it could push some angry young men toward violence. On my recent fieldwork trip to 100 mosques in 75 American cities with a team of American researchers for the book ""Journey into America: The Challenge of Islam,"" we documented that many mosques had been attacked, sometimes bombed. In May, not far from Jones' church in Gainesville, a pipe bomb exploded in a mosque in Jacksonville. As objectionable as the prospect of Jones' Quran burning is, it may not cease with the holy book of the Muslims. I have always maintained that this kind of vitriolic hatred of one religion is a descent on a slippery slope, as no one can say who will be next. I was not surprised, therefore, when I heard Jones recently agree, when asked to do so in an internet podcast interview, to burn ""a couple of copies of the Talmud"" too. Not only does the burning of holy texts reflect the darkest days of medieval Europe and Nazi Germany, but it is hard to think of anything more un-American, by the definition of the Founding Fathers themselves. George Washington welcomed the Jews to America as the ""stock of Abraham"" while John Adams showed the utmost respect for Islam, naming the Prophet Mohammed as one of the greatest truth seekers in history. Benjamin Franklin called him a model of compassion. The Founding Fathers read and honored the same Quran that Jones is now seeking to burn. Thomas Jefferson kept the same Quran in his personal collection and it informed his decision to host the first presidential iftaar during Ramadan. The Founding Fathers were also inspired by Christian thinkers like John Locke, who declared that the true Christian's duty was to ""practice charity, meekness, and good-will in general toward all mankind, even to those that are not Christians."" I consulted many distinguished Abrahamic friends for this article, all concerned with the drift toward intolerance exemplified by Jones' threat, who were happy to endorse this article's content and language. They include the Episcopal bishop of Washington, the Right Rev. John Chane; Senior Rabbi Bruce Lustig of the Washington Hebrew Congregation; Imam Mohamed Magid, executive director of the ADAMS Center in Northern Virginia; Pastor Dr. Robert Norris of Palm Beach, Florida's, Royal Poinciana Chapel and member of the Presbytery of Tropical Florida; the Rev. Carol Flett of the Washington National Cathedral, the Rev. Dr. Clark Lobenstine of the Interfaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington; Sister Maureen Fiedler, Sister of Loretto and host of Interfaith Voices, and too many others to name. At the core of the Abrahamic faiths, these esteemed figures represent  the need to show compassion and understanding of others. By threatening to burn the holy books of two of these faiths, the Quran and the Talmud, Jones is violating the basic tenants of all the Abrahamic faiths and doing something that is unacceptable by any standard of religion. As an adherent of one of these faiths, Islam, and one who respects the other faiths, I implore Jones as a Christian and an American to cancel his burning event, follow the true teachings of Jesus by loving his neighbor, and engage in respectful dialogue instead. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Akbar Ahmed.","Akbar Ahmed: Pastor Jones of Dove World Outreach Center plans ""Burn a Quran Day""

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- A towing vessel struck an oil well in the Barataria Waterway off the southeastern Louisiana coast on Tuesday, causing the well to emit oil and natural gas into Barataria Bay, the Coast Guard said in a news release. Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the government's point man for the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, said there was a sheen around the platform, and vapor that's probably a combination of gas and water was emanating from the well, called C-117. Kyle Plotkin, a spokesman for Gov. Bobby Jindal, described the well as ""orphaned."" He said it had been owned by Cedyco Corp. of Houston but was declared abandoned by the state in November 2008. Plotkin said the state does not own the well and added that the designation does not absolve Cedyco of responsibility for the well. The tug vessel Pere Ana C was pushing the dredge barge Captain Buford Berry when it hit the wellhead, the Coast Guard said. Jindal and Coast Guard Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft, the federal on-scene coordinator for the Gulf spill, and other officials surveyed the damage by helicopter, according to a statement from the governor's office. ""The Coast Guard's overflight this morning confirmed the pipeline/well-head is discharging a mist of orange and brown oil about 100 feet in air,"" Jindal said. ""This is the same thing we viewed on our flight to the well today. The Coast Guard does not have a specific flow rate for the well determined yet, although there have been early reports that there is natural gas and mud mixed in with oil coming from the well."" Jefferson Parish Councilman Chris Roberts said that while oil was gushing from the well in 6 feet of water, it was too dangerous to get close enough to estimate how much oil was leaking out. However, Roberts said he doesn't ""expect it is going to be a huge problem to contain it or cap"" the leak, because ""it isn't uncommon."" ""Until we know the condition of it, the quickness of plugging the well is uncertain,"" said Capt. Ed Cubanski, chief of incident management for the Coast Guard's Eighth District in New Orleans. The Coast Guard has tapped the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, which the federal government makes available for natural resource damage assessments. Environmental Safety and Health personnel were on the scene to clean up, as well as the Coast Guard Gulf Strike Team from Mobile, Alabama. Allen said response crews were able to take advantage of the ""significant resources"" -- vessels of opportunity, skimming equipment and boom -- already in the area to work on the Gulf oil spill. He said C-117 was surrounded by boom. ""The Coast Guard is also beginning oil spill response actions at the site -- deploying hard and sorbent boom both north and south of the oil release,"" Jindal said. ""Air assets have also been deployed to ensure response personnel are not working in a flammable atmosphere. Once the leak source is secured, the Coast Guard will ramp up their skimming operations to collect free-floating oil. ""We know this well is close to important marshes in the Barataria Bay area, so it is important that this well is cut off quickly and the oil is contained and removed,"" he said. A safety zone has been established 2 miles around the site to protect vessels and mariners from the hazards associated with the release, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard is investigating the incident, which happened about 1 a.m. Tuesday. CNN's Vivian Kuo, Erin Lowry, MaryLynn Ryan and Tristan Smith contributed to this report .","NEW: Spokesman for Louisiana governor says the well was abandoned, declared ""orphaned""

"(CNN) -- A judge dismissed charges against polygamist leader Warren Jeffs on Wednesday after the Mohave County, Arizona, prosecutor requested they be thrown out, citing ""much more serious charges"" against Jeffs in Texas and the desire of his alleged victims that he ""face these more serious charges as soon as possible."" Jeffs, the leader and ""prophet"" of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, had been awaiting trial in Arizona on four charges of being an accomplice to sexual conduct with a minor. He was indicted in Texas in 2008 on a felony charge of sexual assault of a child. The indictment accuses Jeffs of assaulting a child ""younger than 17 years of age and not legally married to the defendant"" in January 2005. The FLDS first became known to many when Jeffs was arrested during a routine traffic stop in August 2006. At the time, Jeffs was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. The FLDS is a 10,000-member offshoot of the mainstream Mormon church. Its members openly practice polygamy at the Yearning for Zion Ranch in Eldorado, Texas, and in two towns straddling the Utah-Arizona state line: Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. Critics of the sect say young girls are forced into ""spiritual"" marriages with older men and are sexually abused. Sect members have denied that any sexual abuse takes place. Before being moved to Arizona, Jeffs was convicted in Utah in 2007 on two counts of being an accomplice to rape. He was accused of using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marrying her 19-year-old cousin. He was sentenced to two consecutive prison terms of five years to life. If convicted on the Texas charges, Jeffs could face a maximum penalty of five to 99 years or life in prison and a fine of $10,000.","Polygamist leader's alleged victims want him to face ""more serious charges"" in Texas .

"Washington (CNN) -- Military officials from NATO and its 28 member states descended on Washington last week for a series of discussions about rethinking how the alliance should transform itself in an era when its scope has expanded beyond traditional Cold War boundaries. The seminar was hosted by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is chairing a group of experts appointed by the NATO secretary-general to recommend a new ""Strategic Concept"" for the alliance, governing how it perceives and responds to threats. The group heard from some pretty heavy hitters: U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, all of whom aptly acknowledged the alliance is facing a new strategic landscape with new enemies, ideologies and battle tactics that threaten its collective security. Transnational terrorism. Proliferation. Cybersecurity. Climate change. None of these threats were on the table 61 years ago when the NATO Charter was founded. ""Security"" no longer means merely fighting the enemy on a European battlefield. Today it also means fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan, battling pirates off the coast of Somalia, and combating cybersoldiers seeking to wreak havoc on world economies. Afghanistan is the largest example of NATO undertaking such an ""out of area"" mission, an operation beyond the borders of its member states. Here the track record is mixed: Although NATO did assume control of the International Security Assistance Force in 2003, the U.S. has continued to complain that some European members are not pulling their weight by providing enough military support for the mission. The recent fall of the Dutch government over its NATO troop commitments shows what a tough sell this is. Many Europeans are war-weary after suffering casualties and in some cases are more concerned about homegrown terrorism than about the war in Afghanistan. The U.S. has argued that a failure by NATO to provide enough troops for the mission in Afghanistan would call into question the alliance's ability to tackle post-Cold War security challenges. Yet this soul-searching comes in a time of financial and budget constraints for all member countries. And the widening of NATO's scope to respond to challenges like terrorism, nuclear proliferation, piracy and cyberwarfare requires new capabilities, which means even more resources. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO has forged new partnerships which can help it share this new burden. In addition to the 50-nation Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and the Partnership for Peace, where the alliance cooperates with countries in its own neighborhood, NATO is developing relationships with countries in the Mediterranean and broader Middle East. And it is also strengthening ties with countries in Asia, like Japan and South Korea. The rise of India and China also has NATO thinking about partnerships with those countries. NATO's growing, though often uneasy, relationship with Russia could benefit its widening worldview. Although the original tenets of NATO's mission -- defending member nations, strengthening trans-Atlantic ties, and fostering European integration -- still apply, Clinton said, shared threats such as terrorism and proliferation could foster even greater cooperation with Russia. As NATO seeks to combat threats beyond its borders, the hope is that Russian concerns about a missile defense shield could be eased within this new framework of ""shared security"" against countries like Iran and North Korea. This re-examination will call into question the invoking of Article 5 of the NATO Charter, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all members. The alliance invoked it for the first and only time after 9/11 -- declaring the attacks on New York and Washington an attack against the entire alliance -- and all NATO countries contributed in some way to the initial U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. And as the alliance redefines the nature of security, it is also redefining the nature of an attack. A few years ago Estonia, a NATO ally, suffered a sustained cyberattack that shut down many of the country's essential services. NATO was called upon to help, and now has a cyberteam that can deploy to support any NATO ally engaged in cyberwarfare. But despite the importance -- and even the necessity -- of NATO's ""Strategic Concept,"" its immediate future will be determined by the outcome of the war in Afghanistan. Failure could cause NATO members to be skittish about these new ""out-of-area"" missions, which will more and more mean confronting the enemy on its own turf.","NATO officials rethink the alliance's role in a world of terrorists and cyberwarfare .

"(CNN) -- The identities of two women involved in a horrific car crash in Arizona last week were mixed up, with one family receiving news that their daughter had died when in fact she was undergoing treatment for her injuries while another family kept watch at her side for six days. Officials with St. Joseph's Medical Center and the Arizona Department of Public Safety apologized for the mistake Monday, saying they were ""acting on the best information"" available at the time of notification. Marlena Cantu, 21, was killed in the crash July 18 when the SUV in which she was riding blew a tire and rolled several times. Four others were in the vehicle: a male driver and male occupant, and two other female occupants -- one of whom was 19-year-old Abby Guerra, described by friends and family as Cantu's best friend. The five young people were driving back to Phoenix from a trip to Disneyland in California. ""As doctors struggled to save this patient's life, we could not readily tell the patient's identification,"" Suzanne Pfister, vice president for external affairs at St. Joseph's, told a news conference Monday. ""We interviewed family members that evening and asked for any discernible information that could help us make that positive identification,"" such as bone breaks, scars or other marks. ""From the information that was provided us on that evening, we believed the patient was Marlena Cantu,"" Pfister said. ""DPS communicated that information to the family."" Guerra's family, meanwhile, was told she was dead. Pfister said the mix-up was revealed Saturday when the medical examiner compared dental records and determined the patient -- whom the Cantu family had been praying for at her bedside as she underwent multiple surgeries -- to be Guerra. ""We know this is an extraordinarily challenging situation and our hearts and our prayers go out to both families,"" Pfister said. Sgt. Kevin Wood, a spokesman for DPS, described a ""chaotic situation"" in the emergency room the night of the wreck as the hospital received all four trauma patients from the collision scene. At least one person had been ejected from the SUV. ""(Authorities) tried for quite some time -- something close to five hours -- to figure out who this one female patient was,"" Wood said, emphasizing it was not a determination that was made within a matter of minutes. Pfister said the injuries to Guerra were so severe that she was unrecognizable to family and friends. She said the hospital, which treats about 3,000 trauma patients a year, does not conduct fingerprinting or take dental impressions in an emergency situation ""because the overwhelming emphasis is on saving the patient's life."" Nancy Colon, a friend of the Cantus, told HLN's ""Prime News"" Monday night that the family is ""heartbroken."" Colon said the family was taken into a room at the hospital on Saturday and told that the dental records taken from the female victim at the morgue did not match Guerra's. They were then questioned about the number of Marlena Cantu's ear piercings, her molars and past surgeries. Cantu had her appendix removed in elementary school, Colon said the hospital officials were told. ""They checked the girl in the ICU and she didn't have a scar,"" she said. The family was then told, ""I'm sorry, but that's not your daughter,"" according to Colon. Pfister declined to provide information about Guerra's condition Monday, citing the family's request. ""Our focus is on healing Abby,"" she said. The tragic mix-up is similar to another incident in 2006. The family of 22-year-old Laura VanRyn spent five weeks at the bedside of a woman they believed to be her daughter as she struggled to recover from injuries sustained in a car wreck that killed five others. When she awoke from a coma and was asked her name, she replied, ""Whitney Cerak,"" an 18-year-old who was believed to have been among those killed in the wreck. The two women had blond hair and similar body types.","The identities of two women in a deadly car wreck were mixed up .

"(CNN) -- In South Korea, the launch of ""StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty"" is more than just a follow-up to one of the PC industry's top-selling games -- it could shake up what many see as the North Asian country's national sport. In high-tech South Korea -- which has one of the highest broadband penetration rates in the world -- the StarCraft video game series has spawned devotion more akin to professional sports teams. Indeed, video game players there can get lucractive contracts from professional teams with corporate sponsorships. Games of large tournaments are broadcast live on television in South Korea. ""In Korea, a lot of factors came together to make it a big thing,"" professional gamer Greg Fields told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. The first StarCraft game, produced by Blizzard Entertainment in Irvine, California, came out in 1998 when the South Korean economy was melting down during the Asian Financial Crisis. ""It was in the middle of an economic recession and (StarCraft) was easy, cheap entertainment. It really took over and just captivated a nation,"" said Fields, a 20-year-old New Jersey native recruited two years ago to play StarCraft for the South Korean team CJ Entus. In a nod to the game's popularity in South Korea,  Blizzard first announced plans for StarCraft II at the Blizzard Worldwide Invitational in Seoul in May 2007. About 90 percent of South Korean households are connected to high-speed broadband and the nation has some 25,000 internet cafes, which took in $600 million last year, according to government figures. The gaming market is expected to be worth $5.5 billion this year with a 17 percent growth rate, according to the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA). StarCraft II was first released Tuesday in South Korea and other Asian nations. The original game sold about 11 million copies worldwide . While gamers in South Korea are lining up to get copies of the new title, StarCraft II could be a game changer in the country's professional circuit, Fields said. ""In StarCraft II, the leagues aren't established yet, they're all building up -- it's going to be huge, but we don't know how long it will take, how huge it will be, whether (existing teams) will be good at the game or not,"" Fields said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The Briton accused of hacking into U.S. government computers on Friday lost his court appeal to have his case heard in Britain, his legal team said. Briton Gary McKinnon is accused of carrying out the biggest ever U.S. military hacking operation. The decision means Gary McKinnon faces extradition to the United States, where he is wanted for allegedly hacking into computers at the Pentagon and NASA. His mother, Janis Sharp, promised to appeal. McKinnon, who has admitted breaking the law and intentionally gaining unauthorized access to computer systems, wanted to be tried in Britain rather than the United States. He planned to ask judges at the High Court in London to review a recent decision by the director of public prosecutions not to pursue legal action in Britain, a spokeswoman at the prosecutor's office told CNN July. The prosecutor's decision effectively cleared the way for McKinnon's extradition. The U.S. government says McKinnon carried out the biggest military computer hacking of all time, accessing 97 computers from his home in London for a year starting in March 2001 and costing the government about $1 million. McKinnon, currently free on bail in England, has said he was simply doing research to find out whether the U.S. government was covering up the existence of UFOs. Prosecutors in the United States and Britain disagree. ""These were not random experiments in computer hacking, but a deliberate effort to breach U.S. defense systems at a critical time which caused well-documented damage,"" Alison Saunders of the Crown Prosecution Service said in February. ""They may have been conducted from Mr. McKinnon's home computer -- and in that sense there is a UK link -- but the target and the damage were trans-Atlantic."" U.S. federal prosecutors accuse McKinnon of breaking into military, NASA and civilian networks and accessing computers at the Pentagon; Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Meade, Maryland; the Earle Naval Weapons Station in Colts Neck, New Jersey; and the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, among others. In one case, McKinnon allegedly crashed computers belonging to the Military District of Washington. McKinnon is believed to have acted alone, with no known connection to any terrorist organization, said Paul McNulty, the former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. A U.S. federal grand jury indicted McKinnon on seven counts of computer fraud and related activity. If convicted, he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison on each count and a $250,000 fine. McKinnon's lawyer, Karen Todner, complained that the United States has never provided evidence to prosecutors or McKinnon's legal team to support their extradition request -- and in fact, under Britain's Extradition Act of 2003, U.S. prosecutors are not required to. McKinnon has previously said it was easy for him to access the secret files. ""I did occasionally leave messages in system administrators' machines saying, 'This is ridiculous,'"" McKinnon has said. ""(I left) some political diatribes as well, but also a pointer to say, you know, this is ridiculous."" McKinnon was on the brink of extradition in August 2008, when the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, refused to reconsider the decision to send him to the United States, effectively clearing the way for his transfer. Shortly after that decision, however, McKinnon was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, and he claims that diagnosis changed the case for extradition. It was on that basis that McKinnon made his appeals in Britain. Asperger syndrome is a form of autism that affects a person's social communication and interaction, according to Britain's National Autistic Society. Those affected often are of above-average intelligence and have fewer problems speaking than do those with autism. They sometimes have difficulty knowing when to start or end a conversation and can be very literal in what they say, with difficulty understanding jokes, metaphors and sarcasm.","Gary McKinnon admits intentionally gaining access to government systems .

"(CNN) -- The blowout is stopped. The oil disaster that began with an explosion 100 days ago has not ended by any means. But we seem to be seeing a murky ending to the beginning of the crisis. We have an enormous amount of floating oil, and Gulf waters polluted by oil and dispersant. Most estimates range from 2 million to 4 million barrels (84 million to 168 million gallons). The higher end would make it the largest unintended release of oil ever. (In 1991, Saddam Hussein's army intentionally released about 400 to 500 million gallons into the Persian Gulf to slow American troops.) Added to the Gulf of Mexico's troubles: about 2 million gallons of dispersant, a major intentional pollution event in itself. What now? As a naturalist, I'd say the wildlife effects remain hard to grasp. The damage to people is most easily observable, best quantified and perhaps even most acute. Regionally there's been further damage to Louisiana marshes already assaulted by decades of channel-cutting, shipping, water direction, erosion and sinkage. For resident wildlife, undersea oil and dispersant endangers countless sea creatures -- from plankton to whale sharks to dolphins and whales -- including reefs and the eggs and larvae of corals, fishes, crabs and oysters. Watch a talk by Carl Safina at TED.com . Of hemispheric importance are creatures that range widely but funnel through the Gulf to migrate or to breed. Two of the most important breeders are the world's most endangered sea turtle -- the Kemp's Ridley -- and the giant bluefin tuna, one of the most overfished of the world's giant ocean fishes. Migrants include millions of shorebirds, ducks and geese; herons and egrets; gannets, loons, terns, skimmers and other seabirds; peregrine falcons, ospreys and Gulf-crossing songbirds that often land exhausted on beaches and marshes. How many of these creatures, and what proportion of their populations, were damaged or spared, no one can say. Every oiled carcass found may suggest 10 to 100 undetected deaths. But it's also true that at this point -- with much of the oil yet to go somewhere -- there remain numerous clean-looking pelicans, gleaming gulls, and immaculate egrets along Gulf shores and marshes. People, though, have taken deep and immediate hits. Closures have meant an end to fishing, cessation of a way of life and of the way thousands of people understand who they are. Some may say the closures are artificial, that there are still plenty of fish, probably safe to eat. Others say the seafood safety is unreliable, and that, anyway, future consumer confidence is the most important thing to preserve. There's truth to both sides. The mere tainting of beaches has been enough to send beachgoers fleeing to other destinations, creating a real-estate implosion, hordes of refunded deposits, halted construction and thousands of service jobs lost. Nationally, we're all connected by the loss to the nation's seafood supply and by taxpayer funded government expenses related to agencies such as the Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well as lost attention on other issues, and added unemployment costs that won't be covered by BP. No one knows whether the seafood and tourism and fisheries will be clean and healthy again next year or in a decade. We should be willing to learn some lessons. One is that this catastrophe wasn't just an accident. It was the result of reckless corner-cutting by the oil company and scandalously compromised oversight by the government. As U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, observed, ""BP appears to have made multiple decisions for economic reasons that increased the danger of a catastrophic well failure."" The compromised oversight included the Minerals Management Service failing to require a backup shutdown system required in much of the rest of the world, failing to require offshore drillers to file plans to deal with major oil spills and specifically allowing BP to drill without a detailed environmental analysis. The George W. Bush administration gave top Interior Department jobs to former lobbyists of the fossil fuel industry. Now the inspector general finds that Interior had ""a culture of substance abuse and promiscuity."" Another lesson: Preparedness is near zero. The only two things responders could quickly muster were booms that can't handle open water, and dispersants. But dispersants sink oil, defeating the idea behind booms, polluting much more water, making the oil more widely toxic to marine life and making it impossible to recover or clean up. Absent preparedness, BP and other companies responding to the spill made stuff up as they went; during weeks of blundering, hare-brained schemes like using shredded tires and golf balls to ""top kill"" the well, and fabricating new slap-dab caps and domes that didn't work. Meanwhile people sent their hair clippings to the Gulf. A comedy of horrors. That is not a response plan. Obviously, reforms are needed. Rig regulations should now require that the best equipment and procedures are used. To eliminate guesswork and argument, these procedures must be specified and quantified. For instance, blowout preventers should have a specified number of valves for drilling in a particular range of depths, all spelled out as requirements. Further, there should be explicit checklists and decision trees. If the driller detects a possible problem, the operation must be shut down; they must not retain the option of arguing about whether it's probably OK to keep going. A culture of safety and best practices must replace the culture of risk. We should never again be subjected to the comment, ""We've never tried this at this depth."" It's as if, after the house is on fire, they set about devising and then building a truck capable of spraying water. With all the contracting companies servicing thousands of rigs, you'd think the oil giants would have, say, two or three pieces of equipment in a warehouse somewhere capable of stopping and controlling a blowout at one of their wells -- and capturing the oil. This should be devised and required. Because an oil company's interests are not aligned with the public's interests, the oil company must be liable, but not in charge. Allowing an oil company to run the response to a spill makes it possible for it to try to hide the amount of oil and the numbers of wildlife killed, to suppress scientific data and hamper journalists. The federal government should nationalize major spills, avail itself of the best pooled talent in the oil industry, and send the offending company the people's bill. Once it's on our property, the offending oil company should not touch anything unless specifically directed to do so. As it is now, things are so insanely backward that at the end of June the Coast Guard made it a felony for boats to get within 70 feet of boom. We need to stop putting the murderer in charge of the crime scene. Larger lessons lurk. The mortgage bubble, banking collapse, taxpayer-funded bailouts and this blowout all stem from a three-decade assault on government effectiveness, the consequent deregulation Mardi Gras, and the unleashing of corporate greed and corporate ""personhood."" Corporate capture of government away from the public's interests is the basic poison. Campaign finance reform and publicly funded elections would be the antidote. Lastly and probably most important, to honor the scale of this catastrophe, we need to create a historic moment that begins to give us some energy options and creates a graceful phase-in of greater reliance on the clean, eternal energy that actually runs our planet. There are many reasons to do this. Blowouts and dead workers and the awful environmental destruction wrought by coal mining and oil are some. Helping weaken petro-dictators and gaining U.S. energy independence is major. Helping stabilize world climate and the acidifying seas, and securing agriculture, are yet others. Providing jobs, incentives for construction and investment opportunities are others still. The basic vision is to reduce oil subsidies, create a level playing field for clean renewable energies like wind, solar, tidal, geothermal, algae fuels, etc; construct a national smart grid capable of carrying power produced by any energy source whether dirty or renewable from where it's abundant to where it's needed. Electric cars would be the grid's storage battery. Other countries -- China and some in northern Europe -- are doing this. But I'd rather see American leadership regained. The nation that owns the future of energy will own the future. I want that nation of the future to be the United States of America. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carl Safina.","Carl Safina says precise size of oil disaster and impact on wildlife is not known .

"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- The United Arab Emirates has refused to grant a visa to a female Israeli tennis player, preventing her from competing in the Sony Ericsson World Tennis Association Tour in Dubai, the WTA said in a statement Sunday. The UAE has refused to grant a visa allowing Shahar Peer to compete in Dubai. Shahar Peer would have been the first Israeli athlete to participate in a professional sporting event in the UAE, CNN Sports correspondent Pedro Pinto said. The UAE has no diplomatic ties with Israel. Peer told CNN on Sunday evening she was ""very, very disappointed"" to be denied access to the tournament. ""Any player that qualifies should attend, and I was prevented,"" she said from Israel. ""I'm glad the WTA support me. A red line was crossed for every athlete in the world -- politics should be kept separate from sports."" The governing body of women's tennis said it was ""deeply disappointed"" that Peer was being denied entry to the country hosting the tournament, but it did not cancel the competition, which began Sunday. The move runs counter to WTA policy, which says no player should be barred from competing in a tournament for which she has qualified. Dubai could lose its membership in the WTA tour next year over the ban on Peer, according to WTA rules. That would mean professional players could compete only in exhibition matches in Dubai, the results of which would not count in pro rankings. Government officials in Dubai have not responded to CNN's request to comment over their refusal to allow Peer to compete in the event. ""Ms. Peer has earned the right to play in the tournament, and it is regrettable that the UAE is denying her this right,"" said Larry Scott, chairman and chief executive of the tour.  Watch Scott express disappointment ¬ª . ""Following various consultations, the tour has decided to allow the tournament to continue to be played this week, pending further review by the tour's board of directors."" The patron of the Dubai Tennis Championships is Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Makhtoum. Two million dollars in prize money is on the line. Al-Makhtoum told CNN in 2004 that Dubai would accept Israeli students to a school dedicated to students from the Middle East who are talented at sports. In 2003, Dubai hosted World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings, which Israeli government officials attended. The Israeli flag -- among other member states' flags -- is still part of a globe monument in Dubai. Peer, 21, is ranked 48th in the world among female tennis players. She was allowed to compete at the Doha tournament in Qatar last year, where she received a warm welcome, according to Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz. Qatar, another Gulf Arab state, froze diplomatic ties with Israel after Israel's military offensive in Gaza last month. Peer downplayed the political undertones of her participation in last year's Doha tournament, telling Haaretz that she didn't come to Qatar ""to help the politics of course."" But she added that if her playing in the tournament ""can help for peace or anything, I'd be really happy."" Scott said the tour will ""review appropriate remedies for Ms. Peer"" as well as ""appropriate future actions with regard to the future of the Dubai tournament."" Peer was advised Saturday by tournament and WTA officials of the denial of her visa while she was participating in a tournament in Pattaya, Thailand, according to a WTA statement. The Dubai Tennis Championships runs through February 28. CNN's Shira Medding in Jerusalem contributed to this report.","NEW: Shahar Peer, female Israeli tennis player, says she's ""very, very disappointed""

"(Oprah.com) -- A recent British study found that the longer couples are married, the less they have to say to each other over the course of an hour-long meal.

Twenty years into marriage, the average couple talks for 21 minutes of the hour; 30 years in, conversation takes up 16 minutes. And by 50 years of marital bliss, the average couple converses for three minutes in an hour! That's 150 words or less in an entire meal!

"(CNN) -- Mark Cavendish claimed his second successive victory with another power-packed sprint at the end of the 227.5km sixth stage of the Tour de France from Montargis to Gueugnon. The Briton dispelled doubts about his form by winning Thursday's fifth stage -- and he doubled up in impressive fashion, beating rivals Tyler Farrar and Alessandro Petacchi after again receiving a perfect lead-out from HTC-Columbia teammate Mark Renshaw. There was no significant change in the overall classification with Fabian Cancellara retaining the race leader's yellow jersey from Geraint Thomas. However, Team Sky's Thomas clawed back three seconds on the Swiss because of a slight split in the peloton and he now trails by just 20 seconds overall. World champion Cadel Evans remains third, 39 seconds adrift, while race favorites Andy Schleck (sixth overall), Alberto Contador (ninth) and Lance Armstrong (18th) all finished safely in the peloton. Friday's stage -- the longest in this year's race -- again saw three riders launch an early breakaway. At one stage, Ruben Perez Moreno, Sebastian Lang and Mathieu Perget held an advantage of eight minutes over the main bunch. However, the race came together with just 10km remaining and a confident Cavendish never looked like being stopped once the sprint for the line unfolded. ""I followed Mark Renshaw as usual and it was just a case of finishing off the incredible work that my teammates did for me,"" Cavendish -- who was securing his 12th career stage win -- told the official Tour de France website. Saturday's seventh stage to Station des Rousses sees the race hit the medium mountains and will see some of leading contenders for overall success come to the fore.","Mark Cavendish claims his second successive Tour de France stage victory .

"(CNN) -- Yasun√≠ is both a place and a metaphor. The place is a UNESCO Biopshere Reserve in the Ecuadorian Amazon where two indigenous communities, the Tagaeri and the Taromenane, live in voluntary isolation. Below the biosphere lie the oil fields Isphingo, Tambococha and Tiputini, abbreviated to ITT. Yasun√≠ the metaphor is the initiative for paying to keep that oil underground and leave the biological and cultural diversity undisturbed. Upon learning of just these bare-bone facts, I realized that I have been thinking about the economics of the Yasun√≠-ITT Initiative for most of my professional career, long before I knew where Yasun√≠ is and what it would mean for humanity. In March 2009 I signed a contract with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to work out the economics of the Initiative. Three questions loomed large in the global context of climate change. Why should the international community pay anyone for essentially doing nothing? What should they pay? How would they pay it? Before answering, I wrestled with the language. Because everything changes, I preferred ""climate fluctuations"" and ""transformation"" to ""climate change."" Similarly, ""sink"" is a more precise term than ""atmosphere"" for describing the destination of carbon dioxide. Synthesizing the physics with the economics, I wrote ""The Economics of the Yasun√≠ Initiative: Climate Change as if Thermodynamics Mattered"". In economics, the sink is also a commons, and climate transformation becomes a question of scale. Any one country can pursue a dirty industrialization without much worry; but when all countries do so, a ""tragedy of the commons"" ensues. Alarmingly, emissions have risen significantly since 1990 when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its first assessment report. In some countries, such as India and China, they have skyrocketed. This is not a criticism of India or China. No wealthy country ever became wealthy without a dirty industrialization. ""Realpolitik"" is the reason why the developed countries should pay the developing ones not to exploit their carbon. Tiny Ecuador is a pilot project. What should the developed countries pay? The Ecuadorian government quotes $3.5 billion as half the value of the oil foregone in the ITT fields. As an economist, I cringe. If I or any other economist knew the future price of oil, we would probably be enjoying early retirement in the French Riviera. Knowing how to speculate is what made George Soros a multi-billionaire. In contrast, the value of the investment and operations foregone is known: PetroEcuador estimates them at approximately $5 billion. My recommendation is that Ecuador seek $1.25 billion per year in compensation for the first four years of the Initiative and thereafter, the value of the carbon dioxide avoided. How much is that worth? (Again the French Riviera beckons). If the short history of the carbon market is any guide, the payments would be somewhere between $300 million and $900 million per year. The financial flows would stop when Ecuador achieves the UNDP Human Development Index that Costa Rica held in 2002, the year its government declined offshore oil extraction without any monetary inducement. Finally, the last and touchiest question remains: how should the developed countries pay? The theoretical answer is sponsorship of projects selected according to economic criteria. Topping the list would be the requirement that projects be both public in nature and incapable of being funded from an existing source. The practical side to how countries should pay is also a question about mechanism. Its answer appeared on August 3, 2010. At midday in the elegant ballroom of the Chancellery of Ecuador, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Rebeca Grynspan and Foreign Minister of Ecuador Ricardo Pati√±o signed an historic agreement that launched the Yasun√≠ ITT Trust Fund. That evening I launched with far less fanfare ""The Economics of the Yasun√≠ Initiative"". Ms. Grynspan introduced me to an audience gathered at the UNDP offices. She commented to much laughter that after such a heady day, we were all fully ""yasunized"". Yasun√≠ the place and Yasun√≠ the metaphor have now morphed into a verb.","Yasun√≠ is a protected area of forest in Ecuador rich in biodiversity and natural resources .

"(CNN) -- For more than a year, the spacecraft Kepler has been combing the vastness of space looking for Earth-like planets. On Thursday, NASA scientists will share news of what they are calling the ""discovery of an intriguing planetary system."" Since its launch on March 6, 2009, the space observatory has recorded tiny blips from more than 150,000 stars. If a planet happens to cross -- or transit -- in front of a star, the star dims in brightness. That is how Kepler determines it may have come across a planet. In June, NASA announced that the space observatory had identified more than 700 planet candidates, including five solar systems that had more than one transiting planet. But scientists need to examine further to make sure it is indeed a planet that is crossing in front of a star, and not another orbiting star.","The Kepler observatory has been recording blips from 150,000 stars .

"Chicago, Illinois (CNN) -- Prosecutors have dismissed all four charges against Robert Blagojevich, brother of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, defense attorney Michael Ettinger said Thursday. ""I was in shock and still am,"" Ettinger said. He said that when he told his client, Robert Blagojevich said, "" 'Oh, my God; oh, my God.' And I told him, 'You're done. You're free.' His wife is hysterical."" Ettinger said prosecutors told a judge at a hearing Thursday that they were dropping the charges because of ""the disparity in the roles between Robert and Rod"" and ""in the interests of justice."" On August 17, after deliberating for 14 days, a jury in a federal corruption trial convicted Rod Blagojevich of lying to the FBI but said they were deadlocked on the other 23 counts against the former governor as well as the four against Robert Blagojevich. Prosecutors have vowed to retry Rod Blagojevich, who faced charges including racketeering, wire fraud, attempted extortion and bribery. The two-term Democrat was removed from office in January 2009 amid accusations that he attempted to sell the U.S. Senate seat that Barack Obama held before he was elected president. The former governor will be retried after the first of 2011, said his lead attorney, Samuel Adam Sr. Adam indicated that he is not happy at the limit placed on the number of federally funded attorneys on Blagojevich's legal team. Blagojevich qualifies for a public defender, U.S. District Judge James Zagel said, and he will appoint two attorneys and possibly a paralegal, according to CNN affiliate WGN. A pro bono attorney is allowed, but Blagojevich must disclose the source of the funds if he has any paid representation, Zagel said, according to WGN. The last trial was funded with nearly $3 million in campaign money. ""You saw what happened in court. We're now down one defendant, one less charge, and we're down about eight lawyers,"" Adam said. He said he thought Zagel was wrong to say he could appoint only two attorneys. Attorneys in the case have gone through piles of papers and listened to hours of taped conversations. ""We have millions of documents to go over. We had 20 people working full-time on this case,"" he said. Adam said his next step will be to sit down with the former governor and ""decide what is best for him. ... That's the only question that is important."" Defense attorney Sheldon Sorosky said prosecutors should now dismiss the case against Rod Blagojevich. Adam said it could still happen, noting, ""The government has done some strange things in this case already."" The former governor ""is innocent of any crime,"" Adam said. ""You've got to keep that in mind."" He said he is open to discussions with prosecutors, but has not been approached. Adam said he had not spoken to Blagojevich and didn't know what his reaction would be to prosecutors dropping charges against his brother. Robert Blagojevich was charged with one count of wire fraud, one count of extortion conspiracy, one count of attempted extortion, and one count of bribery conspiracy. Asked why prosecutors dismissed charges against Robert Blagojevich, Ettinger said, ""I didn't ask, but I'm not going to argue with them."" ""What he's been through, and what he thought he was going to go through again, and then out of nowhere, they dismiss the charges ... I've been doing this a long time, and things like this don't happen,"" the attorney said. But ""the evidence was far from great against him,"" Ettinger said. ""I'm sure they know the jury was 9-3 for acquittal."" He said he was told that six women on the jury refused to convict Robert Blagojevich in any circumstances. He said Robert Blagojevich could be subpoenaed in his brother's retrial. During the first trial, Robert Blagojevich testified his brother was ""trying to politically work something to his benefit"" in handling the Senate appointment, but was thinking in terms of political horse-trading, not corruption. In a conversation recorded by federal agents, the then-governor told an aide, ""I've got this thing, and it's [expletive] golden. I'm just not giving it up for [expletive] nothing."" ""It didn't seem out of the ordinary, because Obama was taking a lot of people from Illinois with him to D.C.,"" said Robert Blagojevich, who raised money for his brother. He said his brother ""was interested in the idea of being the head of Health and Human Services."" While awaiting trial, the ousted governor repeatedly asserted his innocence in interviews and on Twitter, as well as during his appearances on the ""Celebrity Apprentice"" reality show.""","4 charges against Robert Blagojevich are dropped .

"(CNN) -- The Tea Party movement is trying to define politics in 2010, but its founding arguments can be traced to at least 1964 -- in a famous campaign speech given on Barry Goldwater's behalf by a Hollywood actor named Ronald Reagan. ‚Ä¢ ""This is the issue of this election: whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves."" ‚Ä¢ ""No nation in history has ever survived a tax burden that reached a third of its national income. ... We've raised our debt limit three times in the last 12 months, and now our national debt is one and a half times bigger than all the combined debts of all the nations of the world. We have $15 billion in gold in our treasury; we don't own an ounce."" ‚Ä¢ ""Our natural, unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government, and freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment."" The nationally televised address, known as ""A Time for Choosing,"" is a classic -- smart, funny and still so resonant that the rhetoric Reagan used more than 50 years ago echoes in Tea Party protests today. Reagan tried to raise the stakes of the election with a vision of apocalyptic ideological conflict, pitting heroic defenders of the Founding Fathers' vision against big-state bureaucrats, willfully wasting taxpayer dollars on counterproductive do-gooder programs that are dragging America toward socialism. Consistent with the Tea Party's self-image, it was primarily an economic speech, advancing a small-government libertarian economic philosophy, making statistics come alive with talk of fallen empires and American history, arguments aided by the added urgency of global conflict with communism. There is the specter of growing government power eclipsing the Constitution, the perverse incentives of the welfare state as an insult to hardworking individuals, all culminating in a citizens' resistance against elite liberals ruling by fiat from Washington. It is compelling stuff, with the pitch-perfect delivery of a trained actor finally getting to recite his own lines. Speakers echo its themes from stages today almost like a tribute band. But, of course, times have changed a lot since 1964 -- and so some questions arise. First, if America's past was as idyllic as many Tea Party protesters seem to believe, how come Reagan was warning about America's eclipse back when the ""Andy Griffith Show"" was still in prime time? Well, the top marginal tax rate was a whopping 70 percent then -- almost double what it is today, and down from 90 percent just a year earlier. That's cause for a serious debate about socialism. It's a reminder that the past was never pure and simple -- though some Americans might remember it that way because they were children then. Second, Reagan's speech did not mention civil rights, despite the fact that it was one of the dominant issues of that election. Both Reagan and Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act on constitutional grounds, and it was this rift that Kentucky Senate candidate Rand Paul was referring to when he awkwardly affirmed libertarians' opposition to civil rights legislation. That does not mean that Reagan or Goldwater were racist -- just as it is mistake to label the Tea Partiers of today racist -- but that heroic fight wasn't their primary or even secondary concern, nor was it that of their conservative constituents. Not coincidentally, the former Confederate states of the South realigned in 1964, with traditionally Democratic Mississippi voting 87 percent for the Republican Party. Another key difference between Reagan's rhetoric and today is the comparative civility. Reagan never attacks then-President Lyndon Johnson by name, and he is even careful to use the phrase ""our liberal friends"" when slapping the domestic left. He does not question their patriotism or call them communists -- after all, the Cold War was still on, and that insult seemed more idiotic and offensive than it does now. There is a final irony -- the Reagan who was elected governor of California in 1966 and ran for president in 1980 would have a hard time getting the GOP nomination today. The self-appointed sentinels of conservatism would have taken issue with the fact that as governor, Reagan raised taxes by a billion dollars to close a budget gap and increased the size of the state workforce by 50,000. He also raised taxes as president. Social conservatives might not have liked the fact that he opposed a bill to ban gays and lesbians from teaching in public schools -- a legislative fight depicted in the movie ""Milk"" -- and they would have hated that he signed the nation's most liberal abortion bill into law. Reagan wouldn't have been alone in his isolation from contemporary conservative absolutists -- even Barry Goldwater could be painted as liberal today because of his support for gays in the military and the fact that his wife co-founded Planned Parenthood in his home state of Arizona in the 1930s. Goldwater lost the 1964 campaign by an unprecedented margin, winning only six states and 38 percent of the popular vote. Apparently, most Americans did believe that extremism in defense of liberty was a vice. But by 1966, a Great Society backlash was in full effect, and the excesses of the radicalized so-called ""New Left"" ushered in a 40-year Republican revival on the presidential level, punctuated only by Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. It is strange that despite the conservative movement's decades in power, Reagan's rhetoric is still used without much adjustment or abridgement. Is that because conservatives failed to tame the beast they warned about, or because the arguments worked so well on an emotional level that they exist separately from any era's political reality? The arguments in ""A Time for Choosing"" work best when it is a rallying cry of a party out of power -- in part because a belief in government's corruptibility is less compelling when you control it. But America's character does not change dramatically with a new president, no matter what party or ideology he represents. LBJ did not represent a mortal threat to the American experiment, and Reagan deepened the deficits he warned were in danger of bankrupting the nation. Both men upheld their oath to protect and defend the Constitution while helping our nation fight and ultimately defeat communism. By uncovering the roots of the Tea Party's rhetoric, we can see it with a dose of perspective. America is still faced with great challenges, but our country is no closer to constitutional apocalypse now than it was then -- and in most respects our country has gotten better since 1964, evolving just a bit closer to our ideals of liberty and equality.

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- Catalonia became the first Spanish mainland region to ban bullfighting after its parliament voted Wednesday to outlaw the tradition on animal cruelty grounds. The vote was 68 in favor and 55 against, with nine abstentions. Those who see the ancient tradition as animal cruelty were ecstatic about the vote, celebrating in the street outside parliament. Fans of bullfighting said the decision, however, does not mean it will disappear from other regions in Spain. Some analysts have said Catalan nationalism -- including the desire by some in the region for independence from Spain -- played a part in the vote. The upcoming regional elections for parliament later this year may have also had a role. Bullfighting is an ancient tradition in Spain, and fans say it combines culture, ceremony and artistry. Opponents, however, consider it animal cruelty. Activist Aida Gascon, of the Anti-Bullfighting Party, known as PACMA, said she has attended just one bullfight in her life, and that was only to get a sense of the bull's suffering. ""Bullfighting is part of Spanish culture,"" Gascon said. ""But that should change. Many traditions disappear as the society advances."" Enrique Guillen, 24, lamented that he might be the last Barcelona-born bullfighter to take the ""alternativa,"" or ceremonial fight in the ring against the biggest bulls to become a full-fledged matador, which he did last year at Barcelona's sole remaining bullring, the Monumental. Guillen's father worked at the bullring, opening the doors for bulls to charge in to face matadors and their death. ""My father brought me to see the bullfights when I still had a pacifier,"" Guillen said. ""It would be frustrating not to be able to give to my children what my parents gave to me."" The number of bullfights across Spain has dropped by a third in recent years, mostly because of the budget constraints of local governments, which often fund the spectacles. In Catalonia, there are now just more than a dozen fights a year and the Monumental bullring in Barcelona is one of the few places in the region that still holds fights. A pro-bullfighting group called PPDF released a study predicting big economic losses for Catalonia if bullfighting were banned, mainly because the Catalan government would have to pay damages to the bullfighting industry, which holds long-term operating licenses. ""When the Catalan government and the opposition are working hard to trim the budget, how could they justify making big indemnity payments to the bullfighting industry, when it's not necessary,"" PPDF President Luis Corrales said. Critics have disagreed, saying the economic impact would be minimal given the small number of fights still held in Catalonia. The proposal to ban bullfighting started as a popular initiative in Catalonia and was accepted for consideration by parliament last year by a slim margin of votes. Since then, there has been an ever-intensifying debate, with bullfighting proponents and opponents gathering support from across Spain, even from abroad. The ban is due to take effect in January 2012. It will not end bullfighting in the rest of Spain, where it still has a strong following in Madrid and in the south around Seville. Spain's Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean does not allow bullfighting, but the ban in Catalonia is considered a bigger blow to the tradition.","NEW: Vote supporters celebrate outside parliament .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Japan hanged two convicted killers on Wednesday -- the first executions in the country since the Democratic Party of Japan took power last September. One of the men, Kazuo Shinozawa, was put to death for killing six female clerks at a jewelry store in 2000 and setting the store on fire. The other person, Hidenori Ogata, was convicted of killing two people in 2003, the justice ministry said. Japan last carried out an execution in July 2009, when the conservative Liberal Democratic Party was in power. Justice Minister Keiko Chiba is a former member of a group of lawmakers opposed to capital punishment --  the Japan Parliamentary League Against the Death Penalty. Speaking to reporters after Wednesday's execution, she said that Japan needs a public discussion on whether to continue the practice of capital punishment. She said she has asked for a review at the justice ministry. ""Witnessing the enforcement with my own eyes made me think about death punishment deeply again,"" she said, adding that she had attended the executions. ""Also, I felt the need of a fundamental discussion to review about death penalty."" Amnesty International Japan said a review is welcome but first, the executions have to be halted. ""We feel strong anger and disappointment over the executions today,"" the group said. ""We highly accept [the ministry's] stance [of] setting up a study session. ... First of all, they must stop the executions.""","The two executions are the first since the ruling party took power in September .

"(CNN) -- A 25-year-old woman who was injured in last week's stampede at the Love Parade music festival in Duisburg, Germany, died Wednesday, bringing the death toll to 21, prosecutors there said. The deadly crush happened Saturday in an underpass between the main event site and an expansion area. Witnesses told CNN affiliate NTV that people pushed into the tunnel from both sides until it was dangerously overcrowded. The panic began when people began to lose consciousness as they were crushed against the walls and each other. The Duisburg public prosecutor's office said 511 were injured. Of these, 283 people had to be treated in hospitals, and all but 43 have been released. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for a thorough investigation into the incident and said that she was ""horrified and saddened"" by the tragedy. Carsten Lueb of NTV said some 1.4 million people showed up at the popular Love Parade festival, which featured dozens of DJs spinning techno music for hours. Organizers expected only 700,000 to 800,000 attendees, so to accommodate more people they opened an additional event site. The numbers are disputed by police, who say the area can hold between 250,000 and 350,000 and at no time was it filled to capacity. NTV reported that 1,400 police officers were on hand to monitor the event. Detlef von Schmeling of the Duisburg police said more than 4,000 police officers provided security. Witnesses told NTV that police were warned at least an hour before the incident that the underpass was becoming dangerously crowded. An additional entryway had been opened before the accident to relieve some of the pressure. Police are investigating how the back-up came to occur in the underpass.","Twenty-one people have died in the tragedy .

"(CNN) -- A voice heard on an amazing video of 300 feeding alligators says it all. ""I ain't never seen so many gators in my life."" Ray Cason's biggest catch earlier this month, when he went fishing at Stephen C. Foster State Park in the Okefenokee Swamp in southeast Georgia, was two videos that have made a splash on Facebook and YouTube. As of Tuesday night they had garnered nearly 100,000 page views, according to YouTube. One of the videos looks like something out of an ""Animal Planet"" special.  Alligator heads bob on the surface while others, in the background, gyrate and thrash in the water as they snap at mudfish, also known as bowfin. The alligators are jammed in a canal perhaps 30 feet wide. ""With a high population of mudfish you can almost smell them,"" said Art Webster, supervisory refuge manager at the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. ""I've never seen footage like that before,"" said state wildlife biologist Greg Nelms who, along with other wildlife officials, told CNN this rare ""cooperative feeding"" happens once every three or four years. Stephen C. Foster park manager Travis Griffin believes it last happened in 2007. Griffin, who was not at the park the weekend of the event, said rangers saw alligators congregating about 10 p.m. July 9 near the quarter-mile-long canal that leads from the Foster boat area into open water near Billy's Lake. No one had any idea of the scene that would greet Cason, 39, of Homerville, Georgia, on the morning of July 10. ""When I put the boat in you had the awfulest ruckus,"" Cason said. Many alligators were in the boat basin. He headed out in the early morning light with another boat close behind. Moments later, they realized they had about 150 alligators in front of them and 150 behind. Cason said the teeming alligators were hunting together. Many formed a reptile wall beyond the canal. ""They would converge together,"" Cason said. ""I saw gators pushing them [the fish] back [into the canal]. I saw them push them to the bank and eat them."" Cason returned to the park the next morning, July 11, and shot more video. He said about 175 gators were visible. The alligators were gone by 8 a.m., according to Griffin. Although he and other wildlife officials said the waters are safe for boaters, the state park waited to be sure that wild morning. ""I wouldn't rent my boats out until they were gone,"" he said. Stephen C. Foster State Park covers 80 acres. It is a small portion of the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge's 401,000-plus acres. Webster estimates the refuge is home to about 11,000 alligators. He said he was concerned that Cason and the other boater may have been pushing the gators along and might have hurt them.  ""This was potentially not a safe thing to do."" But Cason said he waited several minutes for most of the alligators to clear before he proceeded. An alligator bumped the boat behind him but wasn't injured, Cason said. The videos were posted by the Clinch County News. Cason said he hopes to show additional footage to school groups. ""By no means is the swamp dangerous,"" he said. ""It's probably something I never will see again."" Cason had additional luck that Saturday, catching his limit of jackfish and warmouth perch. Life has almost returned to normal at Stephen C. Foster State Park, which is near the town of Fargo. Alligator sightings are at normal levels, it's hot and the park's beauty awaits visitors. Griffin isn't sure whether Cason's encounter will bring more campers and boaters, but it sure has raised interest in the behavior of alligators. ""You can never predict what they are going to do,"" Webster said.","Georgia fisherman's camera catches 300 alligators hunting together .

"Washington (CNN) -- The American Civil Liberties Union is seeking records from more than two dozen FBI offices around the nation about the ""collection and use of race and ethnicity data in local communities,"" according to a press release issued by the civil liberties group. The ACLU is concerned about FBI practices allowed by its 2008 ""FBI Domestic Intelligence and Operations Guide"" that would permit the bureau to collect information and map racial and ethnic data. The ACLU press release says, ""the FBI's attempt to collect and map demographic data using race-based criteria for targeting purposes invites unconstitutional racial profiling by law enforcement."" An FBI spokesman said the bureau is not targeting any particular groups, but that each field office is instructed ""to know your domain, that means you understand your entire community."" The spokesman said that includes information about what ethnic groups are in a particular area, but it also includes things such as what particular high-tech businesses might reside in a place that could be vulnerable to espionage. The FBI spokesman said the focus on knowing the domains around each field office is an outgrowth of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks and the bureau's focus on improving intelligence gathering, analysis and dissemination. The spokesman said this needs to be done in a manner consistent with protecting civil rights and civil liberties. The ACLU is filing Freedom of Information Act requests seeking records from 29 states and the District of Columbia. The organization's press release says the FBI's operations guide gives agents authority to gather information and make maps of ""so-called 'ethnic-oriented' businesses, behaviors, lifestyle characteristics and cultural traditions in communities with concentrated ethnic populations."" The FBI Domestic Intelligence and Operations Guide says agents can identify areas with concentrated ethnic populations ""if these locations will reasonably aid the analysis of potential threats and vulnerabilities."" The guide says intelligence could indicate members of a particular terrorist group are known to reside in communities with a certain ethnic population. But the guide also says it's important to know the location of ethnic groups that might be vulnerable to hate crimes in order for law enforcement to protect such communities. FBI Director Robert Mueller spoke about the use of geospatial mapping technology -- combining software and analytical methods with geographic data -- during a November 2008 speech to the International Association of Chiefs of Police. He said the technique is useful in fighting both national security threats and crime. ""It allows us to combine and visually map crime data from a multitude of agencies -- everything from shootings to sources, and from outstanding warrants to open investigations,"" said Mueller. ""Visual mapping shows us our domain. It reveals connections among our cases we might not otherwise see. And it helps us better manage our resources.""","The ACLU wants FBI records on collection of race and ethnicity data .

"(CNN) -- A Florida man was arrested on suspicion of trying to hire someone to kill an Internal Revenue Service agent who was investigating him, prosecutors said Thursday. Randy Nowak, 48, of Mulberry, Florida, is charged with attempting to murder an employee of the United States related to the performance of her official duties, said Robert E. O'Neill, U.S. attorney for Florida's middle district. If convicted, Nowak would face a maximum of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, O'Neill's office said in a news release. Authorities said Nowak, who owns a Polk County, Florida, construction company named RJ Nowak Enterprises Inc., met with an undercover FBI agent who was posing as a hit man Tuesday. Nowak gave the undercover person $10,000 as a down payment to kill the IRS agent, authorities said. Nowak also asked the undercover agent if he would be willing to burn down the IRS office in Lakeland, Florida, prosecutors said. ""The FBI considers threats of violence against United States government employees due to their enforcement and/or investigative activities very serious matters,"" Steven Ibison, FBI special agent in charge, said in the news release.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- At least 19 people died in a Nairobi slum after drinking illegal local brew, which may have been laced with chemicals to make it more potent, a government official said. An additional 11 more people from the Kibera area are hospitalized, complaining of stomach pains after drinking the brew popularly known as changa'a, said local official Richard Juma. Police arrested 51 people during a raid for allegedly possessing changa'a, and were being held at a local police station, he said. ""As a government, we are not happy about this incident,"" Juma said. ""We will continue to raid where we think the brew dens are located until this menace is completely done away with."" A sample of the changa'a has been taken to a government chemist for testing. Changa'a is sold cheaply in Nairobi slums. While it can take a long time to prepare, greedy brewers lace it with chemicals to hasten the process and to make it more potent. There have been a number of deaths from drinking changa'a in recent years. Other people have been blinded. ""The reason these people continue to drink this harmful alcohol even with awareness of its deadly ramifications is because some of the residents here don't care about their lives, they'd rather drink all day,"" Juma said. Samuel Chege was treated and released Monday at the Nairobi national hospital after consuming changa'a during a weekend drinking spree and experiencing stomach pains. ""I urge other people not to drink changa'a because you don't know how it has been prepared,"" he said. Members of Parliament have passed a bill to legalize changa'a and other drinks, but the president has not yet signed it. ""In my opinion, it should not be legalized because the number of proprietors will increase and so will the number of drunks,"" Juma said. Mary Nduku said her cousin died after drinking the deadly beverage. She said she was called home from work to find him lying on the floor of their house. He and a neighbor, who was also unconscious, were rushed to the hospital but pronounced dead on arrival. ""The government should work hard in stopping this problem,"" Nduku said. ""We are losing too many people. Our people are dying and some are becoming blind.

"(CNN) -- A Somali man Friday became the second person convicted in the United States of acts related to high-seas piracy in more than a century, although he wasn't convicted of piracy itself. Jama Idle Ibrahim pleaded guilty in a federal courtroom in Norfolk, Virginia, admitting he had intended to seize a U.S. merchant vessel on April 10 and hold it for ransom. Ibrahim and five other would-be pirates learned too late that they had instead pulled alongside a U.S. Navy dock landing ship, the USS Ashland, and they were captured. ""Today marks the first conviction in Norfolk for acts of piracy in 150 years,"" said U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride. It followed the May guilty plea in a federal court in New York of a man involved in an attack on the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama off the coast of Africa last year. A statement by the Justice Department said the government and defense agreed to recommend a sentence of 30 years in prison for Ibrahim. Sentencing was set for November 29. The attack occurred in the Gulf of Aden between the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Ibrahim is one of 11 Somalis sent to Norfolk for prosecution in two attacks. Five others are charged in connection with an April 1 attack on the Norfolk-based frigate Nicholas. Ibrahim pleaded guilty to charges of attacking to plunder a vessel, engaging in a violent act aboard a vessel and using a firearm during a crime of violence. The charge of committing piracy on the high seas, which carried a mandatory life sentence, was thrown out 10 days ago by the judge. Until this year, there had not been a piracy-related conviction in the United States since 1861, during the Civil War, officials said. In May, Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse, who was accused of leading the attack on the Maersk Alabama in April 2009, pleaded guilty to felony counts of hijacking maritime vessels, kidnapping and hostage taking.","Jama Idle Ibrahim admitted he intended to capture a U.S. merchant ship .

"Hermiston, Oregon (CNN) -- In war, one family's story echoes the pain of another. I was reminded of that while watching Larry King interview Pat Tillman's parents last week. Spc. Pat Tillman, who forfeited a multimillion-dollar football contract to serve his country, died in Afghanistan in 2004. Many may consider this couple's relentless pursuit for truth futile -- it won't resurrect their son -- but I understand it. It took me eight years to discover what really happened the day my father died in Vietnam's Ia Drang Valley. They say the man who killed my father went nuts. I don't know if that's true or not -- he was dead by the time I got around to looking for him. I wonder sometimes if he took his own life. I could find that out easily enough if I really wanted to know, but I don't. The men who were there in 1966 know how hard Sgt. C. took it. He and Daddy were good buddies. Our families often gathered for weekend barbecues and fishing along on Oahu's North Shore before the 25th Infantry, stationed there, shipped out. They say that Sgt. C. drank too much. There's some that say his drinking is the cause of the fratricide -- that's what the Army calls it when one of your buddies kills you. After Daddy died, Sgt. C. sent Mama a rambling letter about how he wished he could marry her. That's the sort of crazy thing a fellow says when he's talking out of his head. The sentiment doesn't offend me. It shows me how much heart he had, sober or not. When his widow learned that I was writing a book about what happened to my father, she hired a lawyer, who sent me a snarky letter by certified mail. The widow threatened a lawsuit if I quoted from her husband's letter. She didn't have any legal grounds to stand on: You can't slander a dead man. I could tell you his name and quote from the letter if I wanted, but hurting others has never been the point. They say when Sgt. C. returned from Vietnam he didn't go home to Alabama. Instead he went to a head hospital in Texas. They say he spent months there, trying to forget everything he remembered. How that blast from Sgt. C's 105-howitzer pushed my father's guts straight out into Daddy's hands. Sgt. C likely overheard, the way others there that day did, my father pleading with the young doctor, ""Please don't let me die."" These things happen in war, everyone says so, even Mama. She didn't really understand why I needed to know the truth: ""It won't bring your father back,"" she warned. I wasn't trying to bring Daddy back -- I was trying make sense of a world gone mad. I didn't know when I started my search that my father was killed by his buddy. I wasn't aware that there were two official Army reports -- the first one the truth and the second one a lie meant to protect Sgt. C. and, if you believe military officials (and I don't), to ""protect the family."" Pat Tillman's family doesn't feel protected. They feel betrayed. His parents are in the news again, telling us, this time in a documentary, what they've been telling us for the last six years: That their son was killed by men in his own platoon and that the military knowingly and willingly participated in covering up the truth to protect, not the family, but their own sorry asses. (Excuse my potty mouth but there are times when behinney is the inappropriate word). All this reminds me of a quote I read: ""The central defect of evil is not the sin but the refusal to acknowledge it"" (Dr. M. Scott Peck, ""People of the Lie""). The military only needs to practice the integrity they preach. Instead they do the blame-shift thing. In an interview with ESPN's Mike Fish, the Army officer who directed the first inquiry, Lt. Col. Ralph Kauzlarich, admitted officials knew which shooter killed Tillman but he saw no value in going there. ""I don't think it really matters,"" Kauzlarich said. The point, he said, isn't who really killed Tillman but rather his parents' lack of faith: . ""There [have] been numerous unfortunate cases of fratricide and the parents have basically said, 'OK, it was an unfortunate accident.' And they let it go. These people have a hard time letting it go. It may be because of their religious beliefs."" He went on to say: . ""When you die, I mean, there is supposedly a better life, right? Well, if you are an atheist and you don't believe in anything, if you die, what is there to go to? Nothing. You are worm dirt. So for their son to die for nothing, and now he is no more -- that is pretty hard to get your head around that."" You may recall that at Pat Tillman's funeral, his younger brother Rich chided the crowd for their false piety: . ""Pat's not with God. He's f***ing dead. He's not religious. So, thanks for your thoughts but he's f***ing dead."" It's painful to see a brother come undone that way, in front of God and everybody. But given the propensity we Americans have to manipulate God for our own patriotic, and particularly militaristic purposes, I appreciate the pain that propels the Tillman family. Kauzlrich ought to take a lesson from the General in Isak Dinesen's tale, ""Babette's Feast"": . ""Man, in his weakness and shortsightedness believes he must make choices in this life. He trembles at the risks he takes. We do know fear. But no. Our choice is of no importance. There comes a time when our eyes are opened and we come to realize that mercy is infinite.

A grace that may have helped them make sense of a world gone mad.

"(CNN) -- You can't miss Beauvoir as you drive along scenic U.S. Highway 90 through Biloxi, Mississippi. Its grand staircase, with the railings scrolling outward, welcomes you like open arms. The front porch wraps around the entire front of the home, supported by regal white pillars, common during the antebellum period. It's the kind of front porch where you can envision someone sitting in a rocking chair with a glass of iced tea, as the breeze from the beach offers the only respite from a humid August afternoon. When Hurricane Katrina devastated Mississippi's coastal areas, the storm tore up the home.  But it also peeled back a little slice of history about Beauvoir that might never have been known otherwise. Beauvoir was the last home of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Some call Davis a forgotten hero of American history. He was a graduate of West Point, a hero in the Battle of Monterrey during the Mexican-American War, and a senator from Mississippi. When Davis served in Washington, he helped get the Smithsonian Institution up and running after the founder, James Smithson, died. In the months before the Civil War, Davis resigned from the Senate and was selected as president of the Confederacy. When the war ended, he was charged with treason and, although he was never tried or convicted, he lost the right to run for public office. He later settled in Biloxi, and purchased Beauvoir from a family friend for $5,500, although the owner died shortly after Davis made the first payment. It was his last home. Learn more about the home's history . Five years ago, Katrina ripped the front porch completely off, taking part of the slate roof with it, and knocking down several support columns. Windows were blown out, and water flooded the interior. Furniture and pictures dating to the 1800s were waterlogged. Winterthur Museum, out of Delaware, voluntarily restored the furniture and paintings. A paint historian surveyed the interior of the home after Katrina to ensure restoration was historically accurate. This was a tedious project, involving Q-tips, paint remover, and a microscope. But the effort paid off, and with a bonus -- because things were discovered about the home that might never have been revealed if Katrina hadn't ravaged South Mississippi. Then and now photos of Katrina's devastation . The historian learned the white doors were originally painted a faux oak color. The director of Beauvoir, Rick Forte, explained that the doors were too large to be made from real oak, a heavy wood. So the original owner opted for cypress and had the doors finished in ""the king of wood"" oak finish, as Forte described it. The white mantles over the fireplaces in the home were originally painted a faux marble. The historian also discovered fresco art on the ceiling of the reception hall, the front parlor and the library. The most revealing discovery was the architecture. Beauvoir was built in the mid-1800s by James Brown. ""We always wondered whether he was his own architect or if he hired one from New Orleans,"" said Forte. It turns out Brown was the architect, and in some ways, not a very good one. Many mistakes had to be repaired, in addition to the restoration work after the hurricane. ""It cost $4 million to restore the Beauvoir house, but it is a priceless house,"" according to Forte. Today, Beauvoir is anchored to the ground with a foundation of concrete and rebar. The last national historic landmark house on the Mississippi Gulf Coast is fully restored to its original charm and splendor. ""It looks as good today as the day they finished it in 1852,"" Forte boasts. As many as 4,000 people toured the home for its grand reopening, but tourists are sparse now, thanks to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. But Forte counts his blessings as far as the home's survival of Katrina. ""It was like going from hell to heaven, to where we are now,"" he said.","Beauvoir, in Biloxi, Mississippi, was the home of Confederate President Jefferson Davis .

"(CNN) -- A 14-year-old suspect in the murder of a 4-year-old boy found drowned and then stuffed into a clothes dryer in Mendota, California, has been charged as an adult, authorities said Tuesday. Fresno County, California, District Attorney Elizabeth A. Egan said Raul Renato Castro was charged with special circumstances, including murder during a child molestation, sodomy, kidnapping and murder of a witness to prevent testimony. Castro faces separate felony charges of kidnapping, sodomy and child molestation, Egan said. Under California law, a 14-year-old is not eligible for the death penalty or a sentence of life without the possibility of parole, according to a statement from Egan's office. If found guilty, the boy could receive no more than 32 years to life plus 15 years. The incident began Friday afternoon, when Alex Christopher Mercato's parents discovered that the child, who had been playing outside their house, was missing, Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims told reporters Monday. The parents called police, who began to search the neighborhood and nearby parks in Mendota, 33 miles west of Fresno, she said. Soon, the FBI was called in. On Saturday, authorities resumed the search door-to-door. They did not have to go far. In the house next door to the Mercatos, authorities discovered the boy's body stuffed inside a dryer in a closet, Mims said. An autopsy determined he had drowned. The teenager, who had been the only member of his family who was at home on Friday afternoon, was arrested and booked into the juvenile justice center, Mims said. Castro is the sole suspect in the case, she said. He is to be arraigned Wednesday in Fresno County Superior Court.","Under California law, a 14-year-old is not eligible for the death penalty or life without parole .

"(CNN) -- Very few things will make my skin crawl more than listening to someone totally misrepresent the famous ""I Have A Dream"" speech the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gave on August 28, 1963. It's clear that far too many people haven't bothered to actually read or listen to the speech. Instead, folks -- especially those who likely would have branded King a Communist, a socialist, a Marxist or a racial hell-bent on destroying America -- love to tout King's ""content of character"" line in order to push back against a variety of issues, especially affirmative action. Just today, I saw a press release from Project 21, a coalition of black conservatives, suggesting that a rally planned Saturday by a radio talk show host and Fox News personality is akin to King's 1963 march. Coby Dillard, a member of Project 21, is quoted as saying, ""The dream of King -- that every person be judged by their character rather than their color -- is one of the tenets that makes our nation honorable in the minds of people around the world. King's legacy is a gift to us all, and no one person or organization holds claim to his work and his message. I can think of no better way to honor him by renewing our shared commitment to uphold those principles that have held our country together throughout history."" It's clear that Dillard, and so many others, hasn't read a history book or other publications surrounding the march and instead loves to continue to spread falsehoods, misrepresentations and outright fabrications stemming from the Washington march. First, we need to stop calling it the March on Washington. It was officially called the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. If you leave off the ""Jobs and Freedom"" part, it sounds like black folks just went for a walk that day. Upset with the lack of economic opportunities for blacks at the time, as well as the voting rights injustices, the organizers wanted to put pressure on Congress and the President Kennedy administration to put their muscle behind a comprehensive civil rights bill. No, the 1963 march had nothing to do with some hokey values espoused by a radio/TV windbag. It was a day to assemble a mass of people to represent a show of strength and to get leaders in Washington to listen to the urgent need across the country. Second, we continue to misrepresent King's speech as the ""I Have a Dream"" speech. As CNN's Soledad O'Brien reported in the special ""MLK Papers: Words That Changed a Nation,"" the speech was never called that. It was actually titled ""Normalcy: Never Again."" In fact, the ""I Have A Dream"" portion, which represents the bottom third of it, wasn't in the original text. As Soledad reported, King often gave variations of the ""Dream"" portion of the speech, and on that day, he was encouraged by gospel great Mahalia Jackson to tell the audience about his ""dream."" There is no doubt that his soaring oratory about the need for racial harmony continues to send chills down our spines today, but if we as a country get so excited and wrapped up in the ""dream"" sequence, we forget the economic nightmare King painted in the top two-thirds of the speech. When I give speeches, I often tell folks that the ""I Have A Dream"" portion is the ""hoop"" part, which is when the pastor begins sing, scream and shout when he/she has finished the sermon. But the real measure of a sermon is the scripture, which serves as the thesis. So let's get to the meat -- or the purpose -- of King's 1963 speech. At the top, he lays out the vision of slaves being freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, yet 100 years later, ""One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land."" Then he makes clear that the purpose of going to the Lincoln Memorial is to ""dramatize a shameful condition."" ""In a sense, we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check,"" King said. ""When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. ""This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the 'unalienable rights' of 'life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.' It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked 'insufficient funds.' ""But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice."" King then began to talk about the ""fierce urgency of now,"" laying out the treacherous conditions upon which black people lived in, and having to deal with violence and the trampling of their rights. He laid bare the despair of not being able to stay in hotel rooms, having to drink out of segregated water fountains and the lack of voting rights. Then King launches into the portion about his ""dream."" Folks, the fulfillment of King's dream wasn't about getting along. It was about every man and woman being afforded equal rights and an opportunity to find a job, raise their family and not have to suffer from brutality. His speech wasn't partisan or political; it was prophetic and about prosperity. How is it relevant today? If anyone wants to model that march, then stop with the ego-driven nonsense and focus on pushing Congress to enact a jobs bill so Americans can work. Tell Democrats and Republicans to stop playing footsy with lobbyists and looking out for Wall Street's interests. Tell leaders in Washington to give a damn about the poor of this country, from the hills of West Virginia to the dusty roads in Alabama. Tell some Republicans to stop their shameful condemnations of Americans who can't find a job. For the nearly 250,000 who gathered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on August 28, 1963, it wasn't about ego; it was about results. There was no partisan agenda; it was one where whites and blacks refused to stand idly by and watch black Americans denied an opportunity to thrive in this country. In the final five years of his life, King fought for equal pay for sanitation workers in Memphis and was planning a Poor People's Campaign for DC to highlight the economic injustices. Please, take the time to go and read or listen to the speech. Understand the context. Examine the overall mission. And don't try to pimp and pervert King's prophetic word so you can score some political points. And that goes for a charlatan, even if they have a TV or radio show, who seeks to align themselves with King's momentous and radical speech 47 years ago. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Roland S. Martin says the famous speech is often misrepresented .

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- Jairo Tellez's seafood distribution business is a family affair. In the industrial warehouse that houses J and V Mariscos on the west side of Phoenix, his wife, Vicki, and four of his seven children load trucks, take phone calls, enter data and help care for his infant grandson, who has a playpen in Tellez's office. But with portions of Arizona's controversial immigration enforcement law set to take effect Thursday, the business is in limbo. ""If people are not eating, we're not selling,"" said Wendy Cisneros, a family friend who works in the back office. ""We've lost 60 percent of sales, and right now the future's uncertain. We don't know if we're going to stay in the state; we don't know if we're going to close the business. Everything's up in the air."" Most of their clients cater to the Latino community, which has effectively gone into hiding amid concerns that they may have to leave the state as soon as the bill becomes law, Cisneros said. A key part of Arizona's immigration law was temporarily blocked by a judge Wednesday. This means police won't be required to ask people about their immigration status. Toobin: What does Arizona immigration ruling mean? But for the Tellez family business and others like it, the damage from the controversy already is done. Reduced spending in restaurants, grocery and retail stores has triggered a domino effect among businesses in the metro Phoenix business community and throughout Arizona. To stay afloat even as their clients disappear or reduce inventory orders, the business has reduced employees' hours and cut back operations in the industrial warehouse, home to several large freezers and forklifts and an office sparsely decorated with posters of illustrated fish and cuts of meat. Perhaps the toughest decision was to halt lines of credit to customers, even those with good history, she said. ""We can't really offer credit anymore because we don't know if next week they're going to close the business,"" Cisneros said. ""But it's also a downside because some customers need that credit to operate."" Firm numbers illuminating the economic fallout of SB 1070 are hard to come by as the bill has yet to take effect. Also, summer tends to be slow for business and tourism in Arizona because it's so hot. But anecdotal evidence from business owners, real estate agents and community leaders indicates the mere specter of the bill has created a culture of fear among Hispanics in Arizona that's slowly paralyzing sectors of the economy. Hispanics make up 30 percent of the state's population. The state's unemployment rate in June rose for the third month in a row, to 9.7 percent. Gov. Jan Brewer signed the bill in April. Traditionally, community groups look to indicators such as the housing market, school enrollment and data from utility companies to track economic fluctuations within a certain group, said Edmundo Hidalgo, president and CEO of Chicanos Por La Causa, a community outreach program in Phoenix. Based on feedback from clients and preliminary data, Hidalgo said his group estimates that rental vacancies in predominantly Latino neighborhoods will be 10 to 15 percent higher than the normal rate of 12 percent. ""People are scared, and they don't want to wait around to find out what's going to happen with SB 1070,"" said Hidalgo, whose group offers housing, economic and education services to low-income families and individuals, both undocumented and U.S.-born. ""Regardless of their status, people are frustrated with an environment that's not accepting and potentially threatening, and they're fed up with being targeted and singled out by law enforcement. It's driving them out of the state, and not necessarily to better situations."" Reactions to the Arizona immigration law injunction . The Arizona housing market, which was already suffering from one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country, has also taken an extra hit since the passage of the law, according to real estate agents who spoke with CNN. Some homeowners who purchased property in the past year are looking to unload, according to Saul Pua, a real estate agent who sells residential properties in neighborhoods in Phoenix's Latino communities. ""Most families usually have one person who doesn't have papers, and they don't want to risk being arrested and splitting up the family by staying in Arizona,"" said Pua, who is married to one of the daughters of Tellez, the owner of J and V Mariscos. Even during the recession, Pua said business was good because property was cheap, and that in better times, he closed an average of five transactions a month. Since the beginning of the year, however, he has been lucky to sell two properties in a month, and in July, he hasn't closed a single deal. ""I had investors buying properties, but now's who gonna rent them?"" he said. Commercial real estate developer Michael Pollack was in the same situation leading up to Wednesday's ruling. Since April, clients in predominantly Latino neighborhoods across the state had been pulling out of properties or calling to relay concerns over whether they should stay if the law goes into effect. Today, Pollack said he received several calls from clients expressing relief and letting him know they intended to stay. ""The ruling today has definitely been a move in the right direction for commercial tenants and their customers, who've been scared that Arizona wasn't going be friendly to Hispanic community,"" he said. ""This gives the federal government to get to work implementing an immigration policy that the American people will support unanimously and deals with the situation at the border, which is where the real problem is."" Phoenix's sprawling concrete landscape bears testimony to the abundance of vacant residential and commercial property. ""For sale"" signs in English and Spanish adorn brown, sun-scorched lawns and dilapidated parking lots alike, from the heart of downtown Phoenix to as far as Chandler and Mesa -- the district of SB 1070's sponsor, Republican Sen. Russell Pearce. Boarded-up big-box stores loom large in their vast emptiness, and rows of abandoned strip mall storefronts outnumber those that are occupied in some parts. Not only businesses targeting the Latino community are suffering. Economic boycotts adopted by other states and cities have hit Arizona's meeting and convention business. Since groups nationwide began announcing boycotts of the state because of SB 1070, at least 40 meetings have been canceled. That's resulted in the loss of $12 million in lodging alone, according to Kristen Jarnagin, spokeswoman for the Arizona Hotel & Lodging Association. Summer is typically the low season, she noted, and pointed out that tourism was up 8 percent statewide in June 2010 compared with June 2009, which was one of the ""worst summers ever"" because of the recession. Despite that slight uptick, more telling is the lack of inquiries for future bookings, she said. ""What we're hearing from meeting planners now is they won't and can't consider Arizona for 2011, 2012 meetings not necessarily because of their own stance on SB 1070 or the boycott but just because they want to avoid the controversy and don't want to risk losing attendance,"" she said. The absence of meetings and conventions not only affects the hotel industry and its 200,000 employees, but also ancillary businesses such as restaurants, retailers and taxis, Jarnagin said. It seems that not even fast-food joints are immune to the encroaching economic fallout of SB 1070. As the four Tellez children stood with their parents in their office Wednesday, recounting tales of friends and relatives who have left town or seen families torn apart, daughter Nikki noted her surprise at seeing a shuttered Burger King. ""I was driving down Camelback with my dad and Burger King was closed, and I was like, when have you seen that? Like Burger King -- everybody goes to Burger King, and that was closed down.""","Anecdotal evidence indicates mere specter of immigration bill is slowly paralyzing economy .

"ANTIOCH, California (CNN) -- Investigators found another bone on property belonging to kidnapping suspects Phillip and Nancy Garrido on Friday, as they scoured the yard for possible clues to the abductions of two other girls about 20 years ago, officials said. Police search for evidence relating to missing girls Ilene Misheloff and Michaela Garecht. At an afternoon news conference, authorities revealed that the bone was discovered as crews broke up concrete on the property. Hayward police Lt. Chris Orrey said it will take time to determine whether the bone came from an animal or a human. The search Friday at the property in unincorporated Contra Costa County involved the use of ground-penetrating radar, which showed irregularities in an area of the yard where cadaver dogs working separately showed interest Thursday, investigators said.  See how ground-penetrating radar works ¬ª . The Garridos face a combined 29 felony counts in connection with the 1991 kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard, then 11, from South Lake Tahoe, California. Authorities say the couple held Dugard in a hidden compound behind their home for 18 years and have said Phillip Garrido, a registered sex offender, fathered her two children. Police from Hayward and Dublin, California, on Tuesday began executing search warrants simultaneously on the Garrido property and an adjacent property that he had access to. They are seeking any evidence in the 1988 abduction of 9-year-old Michaela Garecht of Hayward and the 1989 disappearance of 13-year-old Ilene Misheloff of Dublin. Both agencies have said that, although Garrido has not been named a suspect in either case, he cannot be eliminated as a suspect. Orrey said ""boxes and boxes"" of writings by Phillip Garrido were also recovered on the property and were being taken off-site so investigators ""can look through every single page."" Little work will be conducted at the site over the weekend, Orrey said, but investigators will remain on the property to ward off trespassers, who have been spotted there in the past few weeks. When the search resumes Monday, two kinds of search dogs will be brought in, authorities said: cadaver dogs and archaeological dogs. Cadaver dogs detect decomposing matter, investigators said, and archaeological dogs search for older material. Earlier Friday, Orrey said the dogs would not return to the area until after it was cleared of debris. ""We just want to have all of the areas clear so they can do another sweep of the entire properties,"" she said. Authorities also plan to continue searching the Garrido house, which county building inspectors have condemned as unsafe to occupy, Orrey said. On Wednesday, authorities said they had found bones on both the Garrido property and the adjacent property but did not know whether they were animal or human. Another bone fragment was found on the adjacent property last week.","NEW: Radar shows irregularities in yard where cadaver dogs alerted .

"London, England (CNN) -- Heads hacked off, a bite from a lion, tiger or bear, massive muscles on massive men -- all clues that an ancient cemetery uncovered in northern England is the final resting place of gladiators, scientists have announced after seven years of investigations. The archeological dig has found ""what may be the world's only well-preserved Roman gladiator cemetery,"" the York Archaeological Trust said. Scientists have found 80 skeletons in the ""unique"" cemetery under the city of York, northern England, since 2003. They announced their discoveries on Sunday, ahead of a documentary about the site due to air in Britain on June 14. This was one of two big archaeological developments, with Israeli scientists announcing the discovery of a huge cache of ancient religious objects. They first thought the graveyard might contain the remains of criminals or political purges. But that doesn't explain the teeth mark. ""One of the most significant items of evidence is a large carnivore bite mark - probably inflicted by a lion, tiger or bear -- an injury which must have been sustained in an arena context, "" said Kurt Hunter-Mann, the lead archeologist on the dig. ""Nothing like them has ever been identified before on a Roman skeleton,"" said Michael Wysocki, who examined the remains in the forensic anthropology laboratory at the University of Central Lancashire. He said the bite marks suggest the remains were of someone who fought as a gladiator. ""It would seem highly unlikely that this individual was attacked by a tiger as he was walking home from the pub in York 2,000 years ago,"" he said. One arm was bigger than the other in many remains, the scientists found -- a suggestion that the men were gladiators who trained from a young age with a weapon in one hand. Other clues include healed and unhealed weapon injuries, possible hammer blows to the head, and burial with ""grave goods"" such joints of meat or pottery -- a sign of respect. It's not certain that the men were gladiators, Hunter-Mann cautioned. ""The research is continuing and we must, therefore, keep an open mind,"" the archeologist said. But ""almost all the individuals are male, very robust and mostly above average height -- features which would also be consistent with a gladiator interpretation. Many also have muscle attachment marks on their arm bones suggesting severe muscle stress,"" he said. They also appear to come from all over the Roman empire, which straddled the Mediterranean for hundreds of years, starting more than 2,000 years ago. ""These are internationally important discoveries. We don't have any other potential gladiator cemeteries with this level of preservation anywhere else in the world,"" Wysocki said. The skeletons are between 1,600 and 1,900 years old. The most impressive grave was that of a tall man aged between 18 and 23, buried, probably in a coffin, in a large oval grave about 1,700 years ago. He had been decapitated by several sword blows to the neck, the scientists said. Buried with him were what appear to have been the remains of substantial joints of meat from at least four horses -- that left behind 424 horse bones -- possibly consumed at the funeral, plus some cow and pig remains. Other graves also had joints of horse, sheep or chicken, possibly remains of funeral feasts, the archeologists speculated. The site was first discovered when archeologists probed an area scheduled for a housing development in 2003. Also on Monday, Israeli archeologists announced the discovery of a huge cache of religious objects about 3,500 years old -- older than the Bible itself, and nearly twice the age of the Roman skeletons. ""It would appear that the vessels were used in a pagan cult that worshipped idols. During this period it was customary that each city had a temple of its own where special cultic vessels were used,"" said archaeologists Uzi Ad and Edwin van den Brink. They include a vessel that was used for burning incense, a sculpted face of a woman that was part of a cultic cup used in dedicating a libation to a god, goblets and bowls with high bases and tableware that was intended for eating and drinking, the Israel Antiquities Authority said. Scientists called the discovery ""extremely rare"" -- both because it is so old and because the objects are so well preserved. Some of them had been brought from Mycenae in Greece, including a storage vessel for precious oils -- evidence of the ancient trade relations that existed with Greece, they said.","Archeological dig finds bodies showing teeth marks, injuries from weapons .

"Washington (CNN) -- The planned large rally by Fox News Channel and radio talk show host Glenn Beck on Saturday on the National Mall is causing controversy because of its location and timing. Saturday is the 47th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech, and Beck's rally will be in front of the Lincoln Memorial, where the civil rights leader delivered his historic address. Beck, a hero to many conservative voters across the country, says that the mission of the rally is to honor American troops and that the event is nonpolitical. A news release for the ""Restoring Honor"" rally says ""this non-political event benefits the Special Operations Warrior Foundation and pays tribute to America's service personnel and other upstanding citizens who embody our nation's founding principles of integrity, truth and honor."" Tea Party activists from across the country are expected to attend, and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a Fox News contributor, is expected to have a prominent speaking role. ""Tea Party Patriots, our national coordinators, are going because our supporters from around the country by the thousands are going to be there tomorrow for this event,"" Tea Party Patriots National Coordinator Jenny Beth Martin said Friday on ""CNN's American Morning."" Beck has been heavily promoting the event on his Fox program and on his radio broadcasts, and he says that the timing of the event wasn't intentional. ""It was not my intention to select 8-28 because of the Martin Luther King tie. It is the day he made that speech. I had no idea until I announced it,"" Beck said on his radio show in June, soon after the announcement of the rally. ""Whites don't own Abraham Lincoln. Blacks don't own Martin Luther King. Those are American icons, American ideas, and we should just talk about character, and that's really what this event is about. It's about honoring character,"" Beck said Thursday on his Fox program. Also speaking at the event will be Alveda King, a niece of the late civil rights leader. While the NAACP put out a cautious statement regarding the rally, there has been plenty of criticism of the event. ""It's offensive because it's out of line with the fact. It's out of line with the truth. The reality is that the conservative movement in America historically has always opposed expansion of civil rights for all kinds of people,"" Michael Fauntroy, an assistant professor of public policy at George Mason University, said Friday on CNN's American Morning. ""From my perspective, there's no real evidence that Glenn Beck is serious about trying to bring people together and to reclaim the civil rights movement, in my opinion; it's really about trying to confuse the civil rights movement and to delegitimize it and in fact dishonor it,"" Fauntroy said. Expect a lot of debate over the size of the crowd. While the National Park Service long ago stopped giving crowd estimates for events along the National Mall, organizers of the rally are putting out predictions. Brendan Steinhauser, director of state and federal campaigns for FreedomWorks, which has been helping to organize the event, predicts a crowd of 250,000 or more. He thinks the crowd will fill up the Lincoln Memorial area, the reflecting pool and reach the area by the National World War II Memorial. FreedomWorks is a nonprofit organization that helps train volunteer activists and provides some of the organization behind the Tea Party movement, including last year's 9/12 taxpayer march on Washington. ""FreedomWorks has been sharing our logistical notes from organizing the huge 9/12 Taxpayer March on Washington in 2009 with Glenn Beck's staff,"" Steinhauser said. ""They are doing the heavy lifting on the 8/28 event, and we've tried to be as supportive as possible in terms of promotion, sending volunteers their way, helping them navigate the bureaucratic obstacles to doing events in Washington, and most importantly, turning out FreedomWorks members for the weekend's events."" One hour after the start of the Beck rally, NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous will join the Rev. Al Sharpton and his National Action Network and other civil rights leaders in a mass rally just a few miles away. Education Secretary Arne Duncan is also participating. Following an event at Washington's Dunbar High School, the participants will march to the site of the future Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial just a few blocks from the Lincoln Memorial. It's possible participants in both events could cross paths. Organizers of the Beck rally and FreedomWorks say they have not coordinated their efforts with Republican Party officials. And officials at the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee all say they are not involved in the event.

"(CNN) -- The Iranian woman awaiting possible execution by stoning was denied visits from her family and attorney this week, just days after her lawyer's home was ransacked and searched. Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani's two children were turned away Thursday during visitation hours, her son, Sajjad Ghaderzadeh, told CNN Friday. ""They told me, 'Your mother doesn't want to see you,' and they wouldn't let me in,"" he said. But later that night he received a call from his mother. ""The guards had told her, 'Your children didn't visit you today, they want nothing to do with you,'"" Ghaderzadeh said. Ashtiani's children have visited her every Thursday afternoon since she was convicted of adultery in 2006. ""This is the first time I was turned away,"" Ghaderzadeh said. ""I don't know why they are acting this way."" ""Our home phone number is tapped and being monitored. My cell phone is being monitored. They have control over everything. I don't know what they are thinking,"" Ghaderzadeh said. He also charged that Iranian authorities broke into the home of his mother's attorney and stole his files. Houtan Kian confirmed the claim, telling CNN that he came back to his house Sunday after a meeting with Ghaderzadeh in his office to find his home burglarized. ""They took all my computers, and files for my cases. They literally knocked my front door down! I can't believe this,"" he said. Kian said he was also denied his weekly meeting with Ashtiani at the prison. ""Because I am her lawyer, and working for her release and trying to prove that she is innocent, for this reason they are not letting me visit her,"" he said. Another attorney who represents Ashtiani, Mohammed Mostafaei, fled Iran earlier this month after members of his family, including his wife, were arrested and authorities issued a warrant for his arrest. ""I made a decision, after I saw that they were still going to arrest me and mistreat me, that I must leave Iran. It was a very hard decision,"" Mostafaei told CNN at the time. Kian says Iranian authorities are trying to ""sabotage"" the case by threatening his safety. He admits he is worried, but vowed he will not bend to ""their pressure."" ""I am scared for my safety, 100 percent. There are no guarantees from the authorities. I am scared for my family and very worried. But I don't want to leave [Iran] at all. I have been working on this case for years. I will work until I prove they are innocent... for all my clients,"" he said. Iranian judicial authorities say a final verdict in Ashtiani's case has not yet been made, ISNA news agency reported Saturday. Last month, Iran's judiciary said the case was under review. The International Committee Against Stoning, a human rights group, has said that Iran announced she will not be executed during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which ends around September 9. Iran's judiciary could reinstate her sentence of death by stoning, execute her by other means, or possibly even grant her a reprieve, according to human rights groups. Iran's Judiciary High Council of Human Rights said in a communique Saturday that evidence shows the allegations against Ashtiani ""have been proved right"" and that Iran's judiciary operates independently, as other justice systems do, the semi-official Iranian Student's News Agency reported. ""The stance taken by officials of other countries and international authorities on legal issues of countries is a wrong, unfair and biased prejudgment since they do not have access to reliable sources of the countries,"" the council said. The statement came soon after France asked the European Union to come up with new approaches to get Iran to stop the pending execution. Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner raised the issue Wednesday with EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, asking that measures be studied to  stop Iran from violating human rights. ""We need to encourage the Union in initiatives to remind Iranian authorities that ... their attitude of isolation has a price, which they can liberate as soon as they choose a more responsible behavior and more in line with their international commitments on the subject of human rights,"" Kouchner said in a letter to Ashton published in the French press on Friday.","""This is the first time I was turned away,"" says son of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said Saturday that he plans to recruit more African-American and Latino teachers in a bid to narrow achievement gaps among students. African-American males make up less than 2 percent of teachers nationwide, Duncan told CNN, while African-American and Latino males -- combined -- represent roughly 3.5 percent of all U.S. teachers. ""That's not a number we can be proud of,"" Duncan said. ""Because so many of our young men grow up in single parent families, they grow up without a strong male presence in their household. They need to be surrounded by mentors and role models who can help them envision a positive future for themselves,"" he added. Earlier this month, he told CNN's ""John King, USA"" that the dropout rate in African-American and Latino communities in many areas is as high as 50 percent. ""This is economically unsustainable and morally unacceptable,"" he said then. ""If we want to close achievement gaps, if we want to make sure that many more African-American and Latino male students are graduating rather than dropping out ... having those teachers, having those role models, having those coaches is going to make a huge difference in their lives,"" Duncan said. He added he is planning a campaign in the fall to recruit the next generation of teachers. ""We have to get dramatically better and we're committed to doing that,"" he said. Separately on Saturday, he told activists at a rally to mark the 47th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech that education is ""the civil rights issue of our generation."" He urged people to stop being complacent and ""step up"" to demand excellence in schools.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Mel Gibson crashed his 2008 Maserati into a rocky Malibu hillside Sunday night, but the actor was unhurt, according to a California Highway Patrol spokesman. Alcohol is not suspected in the wreck on Malibu Canyon Road, which the investigator concluded was ""non-intentional,"" CHP Officer Leland Tang said. ""At that location and on that road, it could have happened to anybody,"" Tang said. ""For unknown reasons, Mr. Gibson steered his car to the right and struck the rock hillside,"" the police news release said. Gibson, who is in a bitter child custody dispute with his ex-girlfriend, is the target of celeb photographers. Gibson publicist Alan Nierob, asked if the paparazzi might have been a factor in the accident, said, ""Not that I'm aware of."" The CHP spokesman said the actor made it out of the crash with ""no injuries, not even a scratch."" He theorized Gibson must have been wearing his seat belt. ""He's OK,"" Nierob said. When Gibson was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence in Malibu four years ago, he became belligerent with Los Angeles sheriff's deputies. He was given three years probation after entering a no-contest plea to a charge of drunken driving. He later admitted making anti-Semitic remarks during his arrest and apologized, saying the comments were ""blurted out in a moment of insanity."" Gibson ""was extremely cooperative, he was a gentlemen"" after Sunday's wreck, Tang said. His damaged car was towed away and Gibson rode home with a friend, according to the police report.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea have completed the English Premier League and FA Cup double for the first time in their history after a hard-fought 1-0 cup final win over Portsmouth at Wembley Stadium on Saturday. In a topsy-turvy match, which saw two penalties missed in a frantic second-half, Didier Drogba's superb long-range free-kick eventually proved the difference, as both sides wasted a host of chances to find the net. In a strange twist of fate, the final was played between the last two winners of the competition -- Portsmouth (2008) and Chelsea (2009) -- but the similarity between the two sides ended there. Chelsea had sealed the Premier League title with an 8-0 thrashing of Wigan last weekend, while Portsmouth had suffered a dreadful season in which they became the first Premier League club to enter administration after accumulating huge debts -- subsequently finishing bottom of the table and suffering relegation to the second tier Championship. And that gulf in class between the sides showed in the opening 45 minutes, with Chelsea remarkably hitting the woodwork five times as they peppered the Portsmouth goal. The most glaring miss came from Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou, who somehow contrived to hit the crossbar with an open goal gaping, after being superbly set-up by left-back Ashley Cole. Frank Lampard's dipping long-range strike and John Terry's looping header also struck the woodwork, while Drogba gave notice of what was to come in the second half with a stunning free-kick, which England goalkeeper David James somehow managed to get a fingertip to, with the ball bouncing onto the goalline and away. Portsmouth themselves had a great opportunity in the first half, when Frederic Piquionne diverted a cross goalbound, only for goalkeeper Petr Cech to instinctively scramble the ball clear. Underdogs Portsmouth began the second half with more purpose and should have taken a surprise lead. Aruna Dindane out-paced substitute Julian Belletti, who had come on for the injured Michael Ballack, and was fouled by the Brazilian in the penalty area. However, Kevin-Prince Boateng's weak spot-kick was hit straight down the middle, allowing Cech to save with his legs. And Portsmouth were made to play for that miss just two minutes later when Drogba found a gap in the Portsmouth wall to fire his free-kick into the far corner of James' net. Chelsea squandered further chances to double their lead, most notably when Frank Lampard missed the game's second penalty four minutes from the end after Lampard himself had been fouled by Michael Brown. However, Portsmouth failed to trouble Cech's goal after that, although substitute Nadir Belhadj produced a couple of dangerous crosses from the left that caused panic in the Chelsea defence. After the game, Chelsea captain John Terry paid tribute to his side, who join Tottenham (1961), Liverpool (1986), Arsenal (1971, 1998, 2002) and Manchester United (1994, 1996 and 1999) as modern-day ""Double"" winners. ""This is an unbelievable feeling and to win the Double with this group of players is just fantastic,"" Terry told ITV Sport. ""I thought our luck was running out with all those misses but it was a great strike from Didier and I thought we were worthy winners. ""The pitch was awful, the worse pitch we have played on this season, but we played our football and managed to get the victory."" The result was also a personal triumph for manager Carlo Ancelotti, who managed to achieve what no other Chelsea manager -- including Jose Mourinho -- had achieved by winning the ""Double"" in his first season in charge at Stamford Bridge.","Chelsea complete a league and FA Cup double after beating Portsmouth 1-0 at Wembley .

"(Mashable.com) -- Facebook has begun the rollout of a new feature, Facebook Questions, which will allow users to get answers to their queries from the entire Facebook community. Similar in concept to Yahoo! Answers, Quora and Mahalo, Facebook Questions gives users the opportunity to ask questions just by clicking the ""Ask Question"" button on the homepage. Questions is also available on friends' profiles just as you would post on someone's wall. We first learned of Facebook's Q&A feature two months ago, when the company started asking for volunteers to beta test the product. The world's largest social network even went so far as to promise beta testers a trip to Facebook's offices to meet with the Q&A team. I had the chance earlier today to discuss the new feature with several Facebook employees. Questions has several defining features: . ‚Ä¢ Photo questions: For example, if you take a picture of a bird, but don't know what species it is, you can post the picture on Facebook Questions and get your answer. ‚Ä¢ Polling: If you're simply looking for the answer to ""Which city is better: Chicago or Dallas?"", you can get your answer by creating a poll. ‚Ä¢ Tagging: The company seems to be placing a lot of emphasis on tagging questions based on category or topic. The goal seems to be to make Q&A discovery an easier and faster process by making it simple to look up questions on cooking, photography, San Francisco or a variety of other topics. ‚Ä¢ Topic exploration: Facebook described this as a roulette-type feature that allows users to browse Facebook's eventual mountain of Q&A. Under the ""Questions about"" drop-down menu, there's a feature called ""Everything"" that allows users to browse the company's catalog of questions. ‚Ä¢ Following: You can follow specific questions for updates and new answers. ‚Ä¢ Updated homepage: Facebook Questions does actually change the homepage, adding a new bar at the top of the page where you can choose to update your status, ask a question, add photos, or post a link. There was one more thing that Facebook made clear to me: Facebook Questions is not an advertising product. While brands with Facebook Pages will eventually be able to answer questions, it's not meant to be a promotional platform; it's meant to be a useful and insightful product for users. Facebook Questions will roll out to a limited group of beta testers today, but the company promises to ""bring this product to all of you as quickly as we can."" The entire feature is public, so we don't suggest posting those awkward bedroom questions on Facebook. Will Facebook Questions prove to be more useful than Quora or even Twitter as a Q&A platform? We think so, if only because it has the biggest advantage of them all: 500 million users. ¬© 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"Washington (CNN) -- A ""permissive"" environment with inconsistent discipline is one of the factors leading to a spike in Army suicides, according to a new report released Thursday. The 15-month-long Army study on suicide prevention concludes there is a need to promote and encourage healthy behavior among troops as one of the key means of reducing suicide levels. Moreover, the report called on commanders to reinforce efforts to discipline soldiers for substance abuse, criminal behavior and disciplinary problems. Many of today's commanders are so focused on getting ready for deployments to war zones, some of these issues have slipped through the cracks, according to Army officials who briefed CNN ahead of the release of the study. ""Now more than ever, our soldiers need firm, fair and consistent leadership,"" said Gen. Peter Chiarelli, Army vice chief of staff, in the report's introduction. Chiarelli led the review team. ""What we witnessed firsthand were real indicators of stress on the force and an increasing propensity for soldiers to engage in high-risk behavior,"" he wrote. In fiscal year 2009, 239 soldiers committed suicide in both the active duty and reserve force, the report noted. In addition, 146 soldiers died due to ""high risk"" behavior, including 74 drug overdoses. During the same time frame there were 1,713 suicide attempts, the report said. The Army found some form of ""high-risk"" behavior such as self-harm, illicit drug use, binge drinking or criminal activity was a factor in most of the deaths. ""For some, the rigors of service, repeated deployments, injuries and separations from family resulted in (a) sense of isolation, hopelessness and life fatigue,"" Chiarelli said. He also noted sometimes there has been a ""permissive unit environment"" which in some commanders ""failed to hold soldiers accountable for their actions and allowed for risk taking behavior -- sometimes with fatal consequences."" Linda Bean's son Coleman, of East Brunswick, New Jersey, was 25 when he committed suicide in 2008 a few months after his second tour in Iraq. The Army sergeant had been diagnosed with Post-traumatic stress disorder, she said. ""I appreciate that the Army needs to identify and address drug- and alcohol-impaired troops,"" Bean said. ""Any workplace should take the necessary steps to combat that."" But Bean said the report lacks meaningful information that can help troubled soldiers and their families. ""It's critical that the Army and the Veterans Administration bring our communities into the conversation, and show us in a very clear and easy way how to access resources and services everywhere, including rural areas far from an Army base,"" she said. ""These services exist."" Bean said such information is included in the report, but ""in a very minimal way."" ""It's a really modest list, buried in two paragraphs on Page 18,"" she said. In his report, Chiarelli was not singling out any particular unit, Army officials said, but rather underscoring the need for commanders to focus on soldiers' behavior even as they prepare for overseas deployments. The Army has long worried that some commanders are so focused on taking their entire unit on deployment, they may not realize or acknowledge that some troops with substance abuse or behavior problems should stay behind for treatment and not deploy. Officials plan to improve record-keeping so a commander will be more aware of soldiers' records of problematic behavior. CNN's Laurie Ure contributed to this article.","NEW: Mother of soldier says families need clearer access to resources .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Kenya has deported a Jamaican-born Muslim cleric who was previously jailed in Britain for inciting racial hatred, the Kenyan immigration minister said Thursday. Abdullah Ibrahim el-Faisal was deported to the West African country of Gambia, Kenyan Immigration Minister Otieno Kajwang told reporters in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. Kenyan anti-terror police picked up Abdullah Ibrahim el-Faisal days ago after he passed into the country unnoticed, police spokesman Eric Kiraithe told CNN on Tuesday. Kenya's immigration minister declared him an unwanted person in Kenya, Kiraithe said, adding that el-Faisal is a threat to Kenya's security with ""proven"" terrorism links. El-Faisal was sentenced in London to nine years in prison in March 2003 for inciting others to commit murder and for stirring racial hatred. He had been arrested a year earlier. He was paroled in 2007 after serving half his sentence and deported to Jamaica, according to British news reports. El-Faisal entered Kenya from Tanzania, Kiraithe said, but it was not clear when. Kiraithe acknowledged there had been ""lapses"" between Kenya's police and immigration that allowed the cleric to enter the country. Kenyan Muslim groups have protested the moves to deport el-Faisal. ""He is being treated unfairly,"" said Al-Amin Kimathi, the executive coordinator for the Muslim Forum of Human Rights, ""He has committed no crimes in Jamaica and has not committed any crimes in Kenya. There is a double standard at work."" Before his sentence in Britain, el-Faisal had spent much of the previous decade preaching in various mosques and selling audiotapes across the country. In one of the tapes, he said, ""How do you fight the Hindus? You have to bomb the Indian businesses. And as for the Jews, you kill them physically. Then you will overcome them in Kashmir and in Palestine."" His lawyers in Britain had asked the judge in his case to consider the Muslim convert ""misguided rather than malicious."" The defense stressed that most of his preachings were benign interpretations of the Quran. They also said el-Faisal, a husband and father who had been living in the east London neighborhood of Stratford, had been a leader in his community. CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.","Kenyan anti-terror police picked up Abdullah Ibrahim el-Faisal days after he passed into country unnoticed .

"(CNN) -- NASCAR team owner Jack Roush, who was injured in a plane crash Tuesday, was transferred from a Wisconsin hospital to the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota, according to a statement released Thursday by one of his companies. ""Following surgery Tuesday night, related to the facial damage sustained in the accident, he remains in serious, but stable condition,"" said the statement from ROUSH Performance Products. ""He will continue to be treated at Mayo Clinic for his facial injuries. The ROUSH organization would like to thank the physicians and staff at Theda Clark Medical Center in Neenah, Wisconsin, for the care and treatment provided during his stay."" When the auto racing magnate crashed his plane at an Oshkosh, Wisconsin, airport Tuesday night, the aircraft ""cartwheeled"" an undetermined number of times and ended up facing in the opposite direction, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Peter Knudson said Wednesday. Knudson said upon landing, the Beechcraft Premier jet, registered to Roush Fenway Racing LLC, rolled ""hard to the right,"" then its right wing dropped ""way down"" and struck a grass strip, and the plane flipped over at least once. The jet ended up facing north, though it had flown in facing south, Knudson said. The NASCAR owner was piloting the plane, which took off from Detroit, Michigan, Knudson said. The NTSB is leading the investigation into the accident. Roush's company said Thursday it would ""like to thank everyone for the outpouring of support and well wishes"" and encouraged people wishing to make a charitable donation in the name of Jack Roush to contribute to Speedway Children's Charities on the organization's website. The Experimental Aircraft Association said in a statement Tuesday night that Roush's passenger in the plane was Brenda Strickland of Plymouth, Michigan. Video showed the two of them walking away from the plane, which appeared to be split toward its midsection. Strickland was brought to Oshkosh's Mercy Medical Center. She was treated, then released Wednesday, Mercy spokeswoman Maria Heim said Thursday. The Experimental Aircraft Association's annual air show, AirVenture 2010, had just ended for the day Tuesday at Wittman Regional Airport in Oshkosh when the crash happened at 6:15 p.m., association spokesman Dick Knapinski said. The accident shut down the airport until its regular 8 p.m. closing time, but the airport re-opened Wednesday morning, according to Knapinski. He said Roush comes every year and ""does presentations as an airplane enthusiast."" Knapinski said Roush owns one of ""probably fewer than 200 airworthy"" World War II-era P-51 Mustang fighter planes and was scheduled to give a presentation about his vintage prop plane Tuesday. Roush had also been slated to appear at the air show Wednesday, signing autographs and talking to NASCAR fans at the Ford tent. ""Roush Fenway Racing is NASCAR's largest team, operating eight motorsports teams -- four in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series with drivers Matt Kenseth, Greg Biffle, Carl Edwards and David Ragan, and four in the Nationwide Series with Edwards, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Colin Braun, Brian Ickler and Paul Menard,"" said a statement from Roush's racing team.","Auto racing magnate Jack Roush has been transferred to the Mayo Clinic .

"(CNN) -- A picturesque New York town is all abuzz and ready for its closeup as the countdown to Chelsea Clinton's wedding starts. Clinton, 30, is expected to wed investment banker Marc Mezvinsky, 32, on Saturday in Rhinebeck. The former first family is guarding details of the upcoming nuptials like state secrets, and has not released any information. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently said she's ""under very strict orders"" not to talk about it. The order seems to extend to those involved in the planning. A host of vendors contacted by CNN declined to comment, including a florist rumored to be involved. CNN could not independently verify the wedding venue. The secrecy and silence have only fueled the speculation. Residents of Rhinebeck -- population 4,000 -- are hanging up congratulatory signs on windows. And talking to television crews. And hoping the influx of high-profile visitors will mean a boost in the town's economy. And ... well, you get the point. Local media have been crowing that the couple will wed at Astor Courts, a posh estate built more than a century ago along the Hudson River. The Beaux Arts building was one of the last buildings designed by the famous American architect Stanford White, according to the estate's website. Lynn Lobotsky, a local florist, recently told CNN that she's seen crews working around the clock along a stone wall leading up to the estate. ""They even worked on Sunday,"" Lobotsky said. Adding to the speculation, the FAA has declared a no-fly-zone around Rhinebeck on Saturday and Sunday. The restriction is for ""temporary flight restrictions for VIP movement,"" the FAA said on its website. Read the FAA's Temporary Flight Restriction notice . Rhinebeck resident Dan Landa is taking it all in stride. ""With everything this wedding entails, I can't believe what's going to happen this weekend,"" Landa told CNN television affiliate YNN.

Is there any rivalry between the Clintons hometown of Chappaqua -- and the town 100 miles north of New York city where the nuptials will take place? They shouldn't be, said resident Susan Cole.

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- The legal battle over a tough Arizona immigration law entered its next stage Thursday when Gov. Jan Brewer filed an expedited appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal asks the court to lift a preliminary injunction granted by a federal judge that blocked the most controversial parts of the law. The court document suggests a fast-track timetable that would have oral arguments on the appeal on September 13. Before then, Arizona would file a substantive brief to the court and the U.S. Department of Justice would respond. The Justice Department responded to the motion Thursday, opposing the proposed timetable that would force the government to respond in half the typical time allotted. ""America is not going to sit back and allow the ongoing federal failures to continue,"" Brewer said in a statement. We are a nation of laws and we believe they need to be enforced."" Following Wednesday's injunction, some legal experts expect that the fight between the federal government and Arizona will reach the U.S. Supreme Court. ""We'll win on appeal,"" said Arizona state Sen. Russell Pearce, who wrote the law, known as SB 1070. ""I got news for the anarchists,"" he added. ""Our laws will be enforced."" But Isabel Garcia, an immigrants' rights activist and a legal defender in Pima County, Arizona, said she is confident that Wednesday's ruling by U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton will prevail under appeal. ""The court will not allow the state of Arizona to criminalize undocumented immigrants,"" Garcia told CNN. The judge's ruling ""gutted"" the Arizona law, Garcia said. The preliminary injunction issued Wednesday prevents police from questioning people's immigration status if there is reason to believe they are in the country illegally. Bolton also blocked provisions of the law making it a crime for people to fail to apply for or carry ""alien registration papers"" or ""for an unauthorized alien to solicit, apply for, or perform work,"" as well as a provision ""authorizing the warrantless arrest of a person"" if there is reason to believe that person might be subject to deportation. The parts of the law that took effect Thursday include a ban on so-called ""sanctuary cities"" -- municipalities with laws or policies that render them relatively safe for undocumented immigrants. Pearce noted that provision in the judge's ruling. ""It was still a victory for Arizona,"" he told CNN's ""Newsroom AM"" program. The judge also allowed a provision in the law that makes it illegal to hire day laborers if doing so impedes traffic. The parts of the law dealing with sanctions for employers who hire illegal immigrants also withstood the first legal test. Despite the judge's ruling -- or perhaps because of it -- tensions remained elevated Thursday. Several demonstrators who oppose the immigration law were arrested Thursday afternoon in downtown Phoenix, where police blocked off several downtown streets and officers in riot gear were deployed throughout the area. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said there were approximately 200 protesters oustide of a Phoenix jail. At least 15 protesters had been arrested, he said. Arpaio, a staunch supporter of the immigration law, and his department went ahead on Thursday with a sweep where violators of the law are subsequently investigated to verify their immigration status. The sweeps do not contradict the judge's ruling because there are other laws that allow the transferring of undocumented workers from state jails to federal immigration custody afterwards, he said. ""Nothing is going to deter the sheriff and my office, including rulings by the federal judge. So, business as normal,"" he said. From the other side of the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexican border, the governor of Sonora state noted that the law has produced ""much tension"" between the two state governments. ""It puts a lot of tension to border states like Sonora,"" Guillermo Padres Elias told CNN. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the ruling reflects the government's argument that immigration enforcement should be dealt with at the federal level. ""Arizona may have good intentions, they may be trying to make up for where the U.S. government has failed, but what the judge is saying is, this is not the way to do it,"" he said . ""I think this [is] a case very much destined for the Supreme Court,"" as other states pass similar laws, Toobin said. Pearce, author of the law, said he foresaw a protracted legal fight from the beginning. ""I wrote it to go to the Supreme Court,"" he said before the ruling came down. ""I'm begging for that fistfight at the Supreme Court. We will win in a 5-4 decision and finally settle this problem."" He added, ""My message to the judge, is uphold the Constitution. Uphold states' rights. This is a battle of epic proportions. This is the states versus the central government."" The federal appeals court could take up the case in a matter of days, but the earliest the Supreme Court could look at it would be October, because the high court is in summer recess.

"(CNN) -- A cholera outbreak has erupted this summer in Africa, killing more than 600 people in the neighboring countries of Nigeria and Cameroon. Nigeria's Health Ministry said more than 350 people have died since June and the infection threatens to spread to the entire country, the most populous in Africa. In neighboring Cameroon, nearly 300 people have been killed. ""There's a lot of people crossing over the border all the time,"" said Dr. Eric Mintz, the leader of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's global water sanitation and hygiene epidemiology team. ""So it's not surprising that the cholera is also crossing over the border."" Nigeria's outbreak had sickened more than 6,400 people and killed 352 people by Wednesday, the federal Ministry of Health reported. ""Although most of the outbreaks occurred in the northwest and northeast zones, epidemiological evidence indicates that the entire country is at risk,"" the ministry reported. Cholera occurs in much of the country under normal conditions, but the lack of clean drinking water and recent flooding following heavy rains are fueling the spread of disease, the ministry reported. Two-thirds of rural Nigerians lack access to safe drinking water, and fewer than 40 percent of the people in the affected states have access ""to toilet facilities of any description,"" the health ministry said. The intestinal infection causes diarrhea and vomiting that can cause severe dehydration without prompt attention, according to the World Health Organization. About 120,000 people die worldwide each year from cholera, and the disease can kill within hours if untreated, the World Health Organization says. Cholera is spread through water contaminated with human waste. ""What puts people at risk is a lack of safe drinking water,"" Mintz said. Boiling the water or treating it with chlorine or filtration or other ways to remove the contaminants can make it safe. Untreated, cholera can kill within hours, WHO said. Mintz said the Cameroon outbreak began in May and has exceeded 3,000 cases. Under ideal conditions, cholera's fatality rate ought to be less than 1 percent, he said. But Cameroon's conditions are not ideal. Many people live far from the medical aid that could help them rehydrate and replace the sodium and . potassium lost in their stools and vomit. ""That delay can be critical,"" Mintz said. ""If you don't get the fluids and the electrolytes replaced through hydration, you can go into shock and die as a result."" The country's northern region has been particularly hard hit. Three of 10 prisoners diagnosed with cholera at Maroua Central Prison in the far north were among the dead, the officials said. Mintz said the rugged and remote region has been affected repeatedly by cholera epidemics, most recently last year. About 70 percent of people living in the country's far north, bordering Nigeria and Chad and the Central African Republic, do not have access to potable water, according to a Ministry of Water and Energy official.","Flooding fuels an outbreak in Nigeria .

"(The Frisky) -- Directing movies has gone exceptionally well for many leading men in Hollywood. Clint Eastwood has been nominated for the Best Director Oscar four times, and Warren Beatty, Robert Redford, and Kevin Costner have all gotten Oscar nods for stepping behind the camera. Oh, and George Clooney didn't do too shabby with his directorial debut, ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" did he? The Frisky: 6 celebs who removed their implants -- compare before and after . Now Angelina Jolie is taking the plunge behind the camera. She's announced that for her next movie, she won't be acting -- she'll be directing and producing. Did we forget to mention that she also wrote the screenplay? The as-of-now untitled movie is a Bosnian War love story. ""The film focuses on a Serbian man and a Bosnian woman who meet on the eve of the war and the effect the war has on their relationship,"" a public statement about the film reads. It continues that they won't be auditioning big names for these roles; they'll be using actors of ""various ethnicities from the region of the former Yugoslavia,"" according to People.com. The Frisky: 10 celebs with bad body habits . We wish Angie good luck on her first directing venture. In her honor, here are other famous ladies who've sat in the director's chair: . Drew Barrymore has been producing flicks since 1995, when she formed Flower Films, the production company that brought you ""Never Been Kissed"" and ""Charlie's Angels."" But it wasn't until last year that Drew tried her hand at directing with the roller derby flick ""Whip It."" It was apparently Guy Ritchie who inspired Madonna to direct her first film, ""Filth and Wisdom."" Like their marriage, it was a stinker. We hope she does better with her new one, ""W.E.,"" the tale of the affair between King Edward VIII and American socialite Wallis Simpson. The flick stars Abbie Cornish and is in production right now. The Frisky: 6 celebrity hoarders . Sofia Coppola made her acting debut as a baby, in the christening scene in ""The Godfather,"" because her pops was the director (Francis Ford Coppola). She also landed roles in ""The Outsiders,"" ""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" and ""The Godfather Part 3"" -- all films her father directed. But then she decided to try directing. She went on to make the ""The Virgin Suicides,"" ""Lost In Translation,"" and ""Marie Antoinette."" She became the third woman nominated for Best Director for ""Lost in Translation."" The Frisky: 30 things women need to quit doing by 30 . Barbra Streisand established a production company in 1972 and wore many hats on the set of ""Yentl"" -- she wrote, produced, directed, and starred in the movie, which got five Academy Award nominations. She did the director-producer-star trifecta twice more in the 90s, for ""The Prince of Tides"" and ""The Mirror Has Two Faces."" Some note that in her self-directed flicks, she gives herself a lot of close-ups. We say she earned it. Goldie Hawn not only starred in 80s classics ""Private Benjamin,"" ""Protocol,"" and ""Wildcats"" -- she also produced them. She didn't start directing, though, until 1997 when she called the shots for the movie ""Hope."" We won't hold it against her that it was made for TV. The Frisky: 1 in 4 of you are in love with someone else . And even Jolie's archrival (as some magazines would have us believe), Jennifer Aniston, has directed. The project, in 2006, was a short film called ""Room 10"" about an emergency room. Apparently, a few years earlier, Jen was even offered the chance to direct an episode of ""Friends."" She explained later, ""Well, I was slotted to direct an episode of 'Friends' And then I got 'The Good Girl.' See? So, you either got 'The Good Girl' or you got a very bad direction of 'Friends.'""

"(CNN) -- A special court in Kenya has been initiated to hear maritime piracy cases, the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime said Friday. The court, opened on Thursday in Mombasa, was built by the U.N. office's Counter-Piracy Program with contributions from Australia, Canada, the European Union, Germany and the United States. ""With Kenya having taken on the largest number of suspected pirates for prosecution in the region -- 123 to date -- the new court in Mombasa is intended to increase trial efficiency in the system and provide a secure, modern environment suitable for piracy cases,"" the U.N. office said.

"(CNN) -- Authorities shot and killed a grizzly bear that mauled a 70-year-old man near Yellowstone National Park, a Wyoming Game and Fish Department spokesman said Saturday. Agents tracked the bear via a radio collar and killed it near the site of the attack, said the spokesman, Eric Kezsler. The Park County Sheriff's Office had closed part of the Shoshone National Forest while they searched for the large adult male bear, which apparently attacked Erwin Frank Evert after being captured and tranquilized there by researchers Thursday. Evert was unarmed and fatally wounded, the sheriff's office said. He was in the forest with his wife, a member of a federal team of researchers studying grizzly bears, authorities said. Members of the team had packed up their equipment and left the area after tranquilizing the bear and putting the radio collar on it, the sheriff's office said. But officials said Evert was attacked when he wandered back into the capture area, located in the Kitty Creek Drainage. Game wardens and federal authorities began searching for the bear Friday. The 2.4-million-acre Shoshone National Forest is just east of Yellowstone National Park.","Authorities shoot  bear they say killed man .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Recovery crews ended the search for bodies in the hills north of Islamabad Thursday where a passenger plane crashed a day earlier killing all 152 aboard, a government officials told CNN. Ramzan Sajid, a local official in Islamabad, said 130 bodies were recovered from the crash site and delivered to several nearby hospitals. ""Not a single body was intact,"" Sajid said. He said hospital officials are trying to match body parts to account for the remains of 22 other people. Pakistan observed a day of mourning Thursday for victims of the accident, called the worst passenger plane crash ever on Pakistani soil. Officials do not know if weather played a factor in the crash Wednesday. Recovery crews have yet to find the plane's voice and data recorders. At Pakistan's Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital friends and family members of the passengers waited to identify their loved ones' remains. Amir Ali, another local government official in Islamabad, told CNN 66 bodies have been identified. Among them, 52 have been handed over to their families. The remaining bodies may have to identified with DNA tests and blood samples from relatives, Ali said. Crews will stay at the crash site to collect any remaining debris and search for the plane's flight data and voice recorders, said Sajid. Another day of torrential rains in Islamabad Thursday hampered those efforts. Investigators say they won't be able to explain why the plane crash until they review the plane's data recorders. On Thursday, Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani cancelled a cabinet meeting, and flags across the country flew at half-staff. The deadliest crash involving a Pakistani airline occurred in September 1992, when a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus crashed into a mountain in Nepal, killing all 167 people on board, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported. Pakistan is in the midst of the annual monsoon season, when rain sweeps across the subcontinent from June until September. The Airblue plane was headed to Islamabad from the sea port city of Karachi when it crashed in a hillside while trying to land. The Airbus A321 was carrying 146 passengers and six crew members, the airline said. The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan said two of the people aboard were American citizens.","NEW: Officials say it's the worst passenger plane crash on Pakistani soil .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Flooding has displaced an additional 1 million people in Pakistan's Sindh province in the past two days, according to new U.N. estimates released Friday. ""We have more people on the move, to whom we need to provide relief. An already colossal disaster is getting worse and requiring an even more colossal response,"" said Maurizio Giuliano, a spokesman for the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Giuliano said rains have forced the evacuation of an estimated 1 million people in southern Sindh in the past 48 hours or so. ""The magnitude of this crisis is reaching levels that are even beyond our initial fears, which were already leaning towards what we thought would be the worst. The number of those affected and those in need of assistance from us are bound to keep rising. The floods seem determined to outrun our response,"" he said. The U.N. also said Friday that it is increasingly concerned about flood-driven malnutrition among children. ""The flooding has surrounded millions of children with contaminated water,"" said Karen Allen, deputy representative of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Pakistan. ""Most have nothing else to drink. We fear the deadly synergy of waterborne diseases, including diarrhea, dehydration and malnutrition."" Acute malnutrition was high in much of Pakistan even before the floods. For instance, 27 percent of children under 5 in Baluchistan province were malnourished, as were 17 percent of children in Punjab, according to the U.N. A hospital in Sindh is overrun with people suffering from waterborne illness; two children share each bed and more are on the floor. A doctor at the hospital said there are ""not enough resources because of huge population ... coming to this hospital."" Remat Chacher, a farmer in Sindh, escaped the floodwaters with his wife and two children earlier this month. But then his 3-month-old daughter Benazir got sick. ""She started to get fever and couldn't keep anything down ... lots of belly pain,"" said Ulla, the infant's mom. A few days later, the same symptoms struck the Chachers' son, 2-year-old Wazira. Both children died on the way to the hospital, with Wazira weighing just 8 pounds and Benazir weighing 2 pounds. Floodwaters have started to recede across Pakistan, but in the Indus delta, the potential for more flooding remained high, especially given high tides in the Arabian Sea, where the Indus spills out. Already, more than 17 million Pakistanis -- from the Chinese border in the north to the mouth of the Indus in the south -- have been affected by the monsoon floods that began a month ago. To date, Pakistan's unfolding tragedy has claimed 1,600 lives, according to the National Disaster Management Authority. That number is likely to rise as more drowned bodies are discovered in receding waters. Many refugees have sought shelter at relief camps, where food and drinking water are now available. But every day, there are new camp arrivals -- people who were already poor, who now have nothing. Along the flooded Swat River in northeastern Pakistan, six local aid workers have spent two weeks braving the torrents on rafts they built from used tire tubes, bamboo and gaffers' tape after motorized boats failed to arrive. The workers are ferrying tents, blankets and other supplies to hundreds of thousands of people stranded across the river and cut off from normal supply routes. Last year, bombs and bullets from the army's offensive against the Taliban destroyed many homes and lives in the region. Residents had barely begun to recover when the rains came. ""We are fed up,"" said Shahravan, a 65-year old man who lost his house in the floods. ""You don't ask a dead man why he's in his grave. It's not his choice."" Fayas Muhammad, another local, said he lost his leg when his house was mistakenly bombed in last year's fighting. The same blast took his wife and son. ""We are very sad for all that Swat has been through,"" he said. The damage from Pakistan's worst humanitarian catastrophe is sure to hurtle the impoverished nation back in terms of development. This week, America's top aid official saw firsthand the dire needs in Pakistan. Dr. Rajiv Shah, administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development, said he was deeply moved by his visit to Sukkur and that aid agencies were ""scaling up their response efforts as quickly as they possibly can."" Shah announced the United States would be diverting another $50 million for flood relief from the Kerry-Lugar Act, which allocated $7.5 billion in nonmilitary assistance to Pakistan over five years. CNN's Sanjay Gupta, Reza Sayah, Samson Desta, Sara Sidner, Moni Basu and journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","NEW: U.N. is increasingly worried about flood-driven malnutrition among children .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A claim that several dozen glass plates bought for $45 at a garage sale were negatives from Ansel Adams brought an angry response of disbelief from the man who oversees the famed photographer's trust. Adams' grandson is also unconvinced. Matthew Adams, who runs the Ansel Adams Gallery, said even if they are authenticated, they are not worth much beyond their historical value. The art dealer who placed their eventual value at more than $200 million said Wednesday that the controversy is increasing their value by ""driving the market to them."" ""They're making them so desirable,"" said David W. Streets. ""People all over the world are seeing this and saying 'I want one of each.'"" That controversy took a bitter turn a day after California wall painter Rick Norsigian and his lawyer held a news conference at Streets' Beverly Hills art gallery to say they have proof the negatives were created by Ansel Adams. William Turnage, the managing trustee of Adams' trust, called Norsigian and those working with him ""a bunch of crooks"" who ""are pulling a big con job."" Norsigian's lawyer, Arnold Peter, called Turnage's attack ""a shameful and pointless disparagement of the professional reputations of some of the top leaders in their respective fields."" The team of experts included two court-qualified handwriting experts, a retired FBI agent, and a former assistant United States attorney, Peter said. Peter said that based on the overwhelming evidence they gathered ""no reasonable person would have any doubt that these, in fact, were the long-lost images of Ansel Adams."" Turnage, who was Adams' business manager before his death in 1984, challenged the expertise of Norsigian's team, saying the only one with art credentials was a ""so-called expert that nobody has ever heard of from Jackson Hole, Wyoming."" ""They had to go out into the boonies to dig him up,"" Turnage said. Norsigian's lawyer responded by calling Turnage an ""elitist."" ""Ansel Adams would likely be shocked and appalled at such blatant arrogance and condescending commentary in his name,"" Peter said. Turnage said Norsigian's strategy is to line up a long list of hired experts to tell ""a big lie."" ""Hitler used that technique,"" Turnage said. ""You don't tell a small one. You tell a big one."" Peter said Turnage ""has converted a professional disagreement over works of art into a personal attack utilizing tactics that are grossly offensive and unconscionable."" ""Likening Rick Norsigian to Adolf Hitler is nothing more than yet another bullying tactics designed to silence Mr. Norsigian,"" Peter said. The lawyer invited Matthew Adams and Turnage ""to engage in a meaningful dialogue and examine the evidence which they have consistently refused to do."" ""We now offer them yet another opportunity to jointly agree on and hire experts who are qualified to render a final opinion on the authenticity of the negatives,"" Peter said. ""Any honest and fair assessment will lead to but one conclusion -- these are the lost negatives of Ansel Adams."" The approach was ""to put these negatives on trial"" using a ""high burden of proof"" to show that the 65 glass plates were created by Adams, the iconic American photographer whose images of the West inspired the country. ""I have sent people to prison for the rest of their lives for far less evidence than I have seen in this case,"" said evidence and burden-of-proof expert Manny Medrano, who was hired by Norsigian to help authenticate the plates. ""In my view, those photographs were done by Ansel Adams."" Meanwhile, Matthew Adams said Wednesday, ""I don't think that they've proven that they are (authentic). ... And I don't know that you could ever prove that they are."" Adams, who reviewed Norsigian's evidence last year, said he wanted more scientific tests, including carbon dating, to prove beyond a doubt that the work was that of his grandfather. He cited ""a number of inconsistencies,"" including the conclusion by two handwriting analysts that notations on manila envelopes containing the plates were made by Ansel Adams' wife, Virginia Adams. The envelopes had five misspellings of well-known Yosemite National Park landmarks, he said. ""Bridal Veil Falls"" is misspelled twice as ""Bridal Vail Falls"" and ""Happy Isles"" is misspelled ""Happy Iles,"" Adams said. Virginia Adams -- who spent most of her life in that area of California -- would have spelled those names correctly, he said. Handwriting experts Michael Nattenberg and Marcel Matley said they used Virginia Adams' writing samples provided by her grandson to reach their conclusion that it was her penmanship. Matthew Adams said his belief that she was not the author of the notations is based on copies of the envelopes given to him by Peter. ""I just looked at them myself,"" Adams said. ""I did not hire experts."" Norsigian's team also said the locations of the photographs, which were taken around San Francisco and Yosemite, helped prove their case. ""The fact that these locations were well-known to Adams, and visited by him, further supports the proposition that all of the images in the collection were most probably created by Adams,"" said art expert Robert Moeller. Matthew Adams said that circumstantial evidence was unconvincing, since several other highly skilled photographers were known to shoot at the same places around the same period. Even if Norsigian's glass plates are authentic Ansel Adams photographs, they would have mostly historical value, ""not anywhere near"" the $200 million estimate given by Streets, Adams said. Streets said his estimate was based on decades of print sales and rights fees. ""There will always be a demand for Ansel Adams' work,"" he said. ""The long-term potential is very easy to prove for these."" ""You can't print original photographs from them because Ansel's not around to print them,"" Matthew Adams said. ""Anything you make from them you would have to say is an unknown interpretation of something that may be Ansel's."" The Ansel Adams Gallery is still producing prints, but with a printer who was trained by Adams. The iconic artist died in 1984 at the age of 82. ""A lot of the magic that he created was in the darkroom making the print,"" his grandson said. ""Ansel's not around to tell us how he would have printed it."" Streets countered Adams, saying, ""It's not a mysterious process."" ""There are master printmakers who are making prints today,"" he said. Norsigian has contracted with Jesse Kallisher, whose prints hang in the Smithsonian and the Louvre museums, to produce original fine arts prints from the negatives, Streets said. While Matthew Adams is unconvinced, he doesn't doubt that Norsigian is sincere in his belief that he has Ansel Adams negatives. ""I think that they do believe it, but I don't think that they have proven it,"" he said. He doesn't agree, however, with Turnage's charge that it's a ""con job."" ""My take on it is that it is irresponsible to present them as Ansel's,"" Matthew Adams said. Norsigian, a painter for the Fresno school system, kept the glass plates under his pool table for four years before realizing they might be too valuable to store at home. He believes they were from Adams' early career, a period that is not well documented since a 1937 darkroom fire destroyed 5,000 of his plates. ""It truly is a missing link of Ansel Adams and history and his career,"" Streets said. Norsigian, who scours garage sales for antiques, was looking for a barber chair when he spotted two deteriorated boxes in the spring of 2000. When he pulled one of the glass negatives out, he saw Yosemite. ""As a young man, I worked at Yosemite quite a bit. So, right away I recognized it as Yosemite,"" Norsigian said. He bargained with the seller, finally negotiating the price for the boxes down from $70 to $45. The owner said he bought them in the 1940s at a warehouse salvage sale in Los Angeles. It would be two years before Norsigian realized the photos might be from Adams, he said. After four years, he had done enough research to realize the plates could be valuable. He moved them from under his pool table and placed them in a bank vault. How these 6.5-inch x 8.5-inch glass plate negatives of famous Yosemite landscapes and San Francisco landmarks -- some of them showing fire damage -- might have made their way from Adams' collection 70 years ago to a Southern California garage sale in 2000 can only be guessed. Photography expert Patrick Alt, who helped confirm the authenticity of the negatives, suspects Adams carried them to use in a photography class he was teaching in Pasadena, California, in the early 1940s. ""It is my belief that he brought these negatives with him for teaching purposes and to show students how to not let their negatives be engulfed in a fire,"" Alt said. ""I think this clearly explains the range of work in these negatives, from very early pictorialist boat pictures, to images not as successful, to images of the highest level of his work during this time period."" Alt said it is impossible to know why Adams would store them in Pasadena and never reclaim them. For now, the photos will go on a tour of universities and museums, starting in October at Fresno State University, Norsigian said. ""I just hope everybody enjoys them,"" he said. Norsigian said he has not spoken with the man who sold him the two boxes a decade ago. ""If he's still around, I'm afraid he may come looking for me,"" he said. Norsigian, who is 64, is still working but said he may retire this year.","NEW: Ansel Adams' trustee says garage sale claim is a ""con job""

"(CNN) -- A second U.S. sailor who went missing in Afghanistan last week is dead, a Pentagon official said Thursday. Petty Officer 3rd Class Jarod Newlove, 25, of Renton, Washington, was one of two sailors involved in a firefight on Friday in eastern Afghanistan. They were traveling in Logar province when they were attacked, the military said. Deen Mohammad Darwish, a Logar province official, said Newlove's body was found in the Baraki Barak district of the province early on Wednesday. Newlove's family was notified the same day, the Pentagon official said. The sailor died of wounds he sustained from the firefight when the two sailors were captured, Darwish said. Newlove had five gunshot wounds, including one to the head, Darwish said. The government asked the local elders of the province to form a committee and talk to the Taliban in order to retrieve the missing sailor. Because of the negotiations with the elders, the Taliban gave the body back without submitting any demands, Darwish said. Afghan and coalition forces first recovered the remains of Petty Officer 2nd Class Justin McNeley, 30, of Wheatridge, Colorado, on Sunday. Petty had been listed as duty status whereabouts unknown. On Monday, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said one American died in a firefight and the other was being held by the group. Mujahid said the two Americans were driving in a civilian vehicle in the village of Dasht, in Charkh district. The Taliban wanted to take both men alive, but the firefight broke out, killing one of the Americans, Mujahid said. The other was alive and being held in a safe location, he said at the time. Newlove's family released a statement through the Navy asking that the media release no details of the incident or information about the family. Darwish said he learned from locals that McNeley was killed. He said the body was found in the Patanak Mountains of Charkh district. He also said the vehicle the men were driving was located Sunday. There had been no immediate demands by the Taliban for the return of the Americans because the group was still deliberating what its demands would be, Mujahid said.

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda-linked militants have banned three international aid groups from working in Somalia, claiming they are ""actively propagating Christianity"" in the predominantly Muslim nation. Al-Shabaab, the Islamist militant group battling Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government, ordered World Vision, Adventist Development and Relief Agency and Diakonia to cease their operations. ""Acting as missionaries under the guise of humanitarian work, the organizations have been spreading their corrupted ideologies in order to taint the pure creed of the Muslims in Somalia,"" the militant group said in a statement Monday. ""Along with their missionary work, the proliferation of corruption and indecency has become prevalent as a result of their presence,"" the statement said, warning other non-governmental groups against engaging in ""similar activities"" All three organizations are Christian aid groups. However, as signatories of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement code of conduct, they have specific polices against proselytizing when distributing aid. World Vision -- which serves about 100 million people in nearly 100 countries around the world -- said it was ""surprised and disappointed"" by Al-Shabaab's order. The group said it is motivated by its faith to help those living in poverty, but is impartial when handing out aid. ""World Vision Somalia received a demand today from Al-Shabaab to close operations in Somalia,"" World Vision said in a statement Monday. ""World Vision guards were disarmed and their keys were taken. Nothing was removed from the offices although Al-Shabaab representatives occupied the offices."" The group said its operations in south central Somalia have been temporarily suspended as ""we plan our next steps.""

More than 650,000 Somalis benefited from the group's humanitarian work in 2008, the group said in a statement. ""ADRA remains committed to serving the people of Somalia as circumstances allow,"" the group said. There was no immediate response from Diakonia, a joint international development organization of five Swedish churches.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Another Taliban leader has been seized in neighboring Pakistan by security forces, sources said. Mullah Abdul Salam was arrested last week, according to Afghan government officials, Taliban sources and a U.S. official. Word of Salam's arrest comes days after news of the capture of the Afghan Taliban's reputed second-in-command, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. ""The Taliban is down another 'shadow governor,' "" the American source said of Salam. The source declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the information. The news came against the background of an intensified U.S.-led campaign against insurgents on both sides of the border. Taliban fighters are resisting Operation Moshtarak, an allied military push into areas the Taliban control in southern Afghanistan's Helmand province. ""They know this is their last stronghold. They're not backing down,"" CNN's Atia Abawi reported from the battlefield, where she is embedded with U.S. Marines. The crackle of small-arms fire and the whoosh of outgoing mortar rounds from the Marines were clearly audible on the line as she described the battle. ""About five minutes ago, Taliban started attacking our area,"" she said shortly before 8 a.m. ET. ""The Taliban are not giving up -- they seem to be coming out in squads, [but] they know they can't group together in large numbers"" because it would make them easier targets. The Taliban seem to include ""foreign fighters who will fight to the death,"" she said. It will take NATO-led military forces ""another 25 to 30 days to secure that which needs to be secured"" in Helmand and a further three months to ensure insurgents are kept out of the area, British Maj. Gen. Nick Carter said Thursday in a briefing from Afghanistan broadcast by the Pentagon Channel. The Nad-e Ali district is ""broadly secure,"" Carter said, noting there is still Taliban resistance in Marjah. ""It will be some days before we can be completely confident that Marjah is secure,"" said Carter, the International Security Assistance Force's head of Regional Command South. Ten civilians were killed on the second day of the operation, he said. Reports at the time said 12 were killed. There have been five casualties among the NATO-led forces during the operation, the forces said in a statement Thursday, without giving further details. It said later that four ISAF servicemembers died Thursday -- two of them in an improvised explosive device strike; another after a separate IED attack; small-arms fire killed the fourth servicemember. It was not immediately clear whether the four were among the five casualties noted earlier. The four deaths bring to 44 the number of Americans killed this year in Afghanistan. In all, 78 coalition forces have died this year . Across the border in Pakistan, four people were killed and five were wounded Thursday when a drone fired on a suspected militant compound in the country's tribal region, intelligence sources and a local political official said. The four dead were suspected militants, two intelligence officials said. It was not clear whether the wounded also were militants. The remote-controlled aircraft fired two missiles at the compound in the Danday Darpakhel area of North Waziristan, one of seven districts in the tribal region along the Afghan border, the sources said. They asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media. The U.S. military does not comment on reported attacks by the pilotless aircraft, but the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones. Salam was arrested in Pakistan, the Afghan government and Taliban sources said, but they named different cities as the location of his capture. Gov. Muhammad Omar of Afghanistan's Kunduz province said Salam was detained in Quetta, where the Afghan Taliban reportedly has its leadership councils. The Taliban sources said he was nabbed in Faisalabad. Salam is believed to be the Taliban commander for Kunduz, Omar said. Salam was directing Taliban military operations in the province, including ordering terrorist actions, mine planting and suicide attacks, said Abdul Razaq Yaqubi, police chief in Kunduz. Yaqubi said Salam and another Taliban ""shadow governor,"" Mullah Salih, were arrested last week in the Pakistani city of Peshawar. He said the information came from Pakistani authorities. Salih was the shadow governor of Baghlan province, the police chief said. There was no immediate confirmation of Salih's arrest. Taliban sources and Omar said other suspected members of the Afghan Taliban were arrested with Salam, but their identities are not clear. CNN's Pam Benson in Washington and journalist Mati Matiullah in Kabul contributed to this report.","NEW: NATO-led forces will secure Helmand in ""25 to 30 days,"" British general says .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- The Bush administration made a ""fatal mistake"" by talking up facts and figures without painting a broader picture of the obstacles in its widely criticized Hurricane Katrina response effort, ex-FEMA chief Michael Brown said Thursday. Brown told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the talking points he and other federal officials used at the time didn't tell the whole story. ""They were factually correct, but weren't in context. We're moving all of this stuff in. We have teams here. Rescue teams are doing this,"" he said. ""But we never explained to the people that it's not coming as fast as we want it to, and it's not enough, because of the number of people that were left behind in the aftermath of the storm."" Not making that clear was a ""fatal mistake,"" Brown said. ""Had I said that at the time, I probably would have gotten the old hook and been pulled off the stage anyway, but the truth would have been out,"" he said. Speaking five years after the storm hit, Brown sharply criticized former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff's handling of the situation. Chertoff had attended an avian flu convention amid the disaster. ""Here is why that's so important. In the middle of any crisis,"" Brown said, ""whether it's a natural disaster or man-made disaster, you need to have one person in charge. And that person needs to be on the ground with the team, understanding what's going on."" The former FEMA head told CNN that he winced when President George Bush said the now infamous line, ""Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job."" ""I knew the minute he said that, the media and everybody else would see a disconnect between what he was saying and what I was witnessing on the ground,"" Brown said. ""That's the president's style. His attitude and demeanor is always one of being a cheerleader and trying to encourage people to keep moving. It was just the wrong time and the wrong place."" Brown headed FEMA under the Bush administration and resigned in September 2005, two weeks after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast and 10 days after President Bush famously complimented him. Chertoff was criticized by a House committee in 2006 for choosing Brown to lead the government response, despite inadequate training. ""If I knew then what I know now about Mr. Brown's agenda, I would have done something different,"" Chertoff said. Hurricane Katrina's fifth anniversary is Sunday. Brown, who is now on KOA-850 AM in Denver, Colorado, was in New Orleans this week broadcasting his radio show.","Brown says officials should have acknowledged that aid was not arriving quickly enough .

"DAYTON, Ohio (CNN) -- Early on, Maria Lauterbach knew exactly what she wanted to do in life. Dressed in her high school soccer uniform, Maria Lauterbach said she wanted to be a Marine, then a cop. ""After high school, I am going into the Marines,"" a smiling Lauterbach, dressed in her high school soccer uniform, says in a video made available exclusively to CNN. ""I'll probably be doing that for 20 or 25 years, and then hopefully after that, becoming a cop."" Lauterbach became a Marine, but her dreams were cut short. Her body was found buried in the backyard of a fellow Marine, Cpl. Cesar Laurean, near Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, in January.  Watch Lauterbach talk about her future plans ¬ª . Mary Lauterbach, Maria's mother, wants to know why the Marines didn't do more to protect her daughter from Laurean, whom Maria Lauterbach had accused of rape in May 2007. ""My concern is I want women to be better protected,"" Lauterbach, of Dayton, Ohio, told CNN.  Watch how mother wants answers from Marines ¬ª . Laurean now faces murder charges. He fled the Camp Lejeune area on January 11. The FBI says he went to his native Mexico, and a cousin of Laurean's reported seeing him in Zapopan, Mexico, in mid-January. Mary Lauterbach has sent a list of more than 30 questions to the commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, Gen. James Conway, through her congressman. She says she's unconvinced her daughter's rape allegation against Laurean was treated seriously. Maria Lauterbach was 20 years old and eight months pregnant when she was reported missing after she failed to report for duty at Camp Lejeune in mid-December. Her body was found nearly a month later beneath a fire pit in Laurean's backyard. It is unclear whether he was the father of her unborn child. After Maria Lauterbach accused Laurean of rape, she was moved to another office, and military protective orders were issued to keep the accused from the accuser. But Mary Lauterbach and her congressman, Rep. Mike Turner, say the Marines didn't do enough to protect her. ""My daughter wanted to be transferred to another base,"" her mother said. She said her daughter told her in phone conversations that she would occasionally see Laurean at meetings and that it traumatized her. The questions Turner, an Ohio Republican, sent to Conway include what steps were taken to protect Lauterbach after she accused Laurean of rape; why no search was launched immediately after she failed to report for duty; whether she requested a transfer to another base before her death; and whether Laurean was asked for a DNA sample after her pregnancy was confirmed. A Marine Corps spokesman told CNN the service would respond to all of the questions submitted through Turner and would not comment further until those answers were complete. Merle Wilberding, Lauterbach's family attorney, said the military protective order ""really wasn't very effective."" Wilberding also questions the length of the investigation. The next step would have been an Article 32 hearing, the military's equivalent of a open grand jury proceeding. Lauterbach disappeared in mid-December when she failed to show up for work. ""May 11 to December 14 is a long time for resentment to fester, if that's what it was,"" Wilberding says. ""The longer these cases go on, I think the more difficult it is for the victim,"" he adds. After Maria Lauterbach first leveled her charges, she changed her story but later continued to claim she was raped by Laurean. ""The problem is when someone has perceived credibility issues, you still must protect the person who is making those claims,"" her mother said. The Marine Corps has said it reviewed its handling of Lauterbach's rape allegations. Turner says a general told him everything was done appropriately. ""I disagree that the review is complete,"" Turner told CNN. ""This is a matter where clearly there is a tragic death, there is a national interest in other women that are serving, and this is a matter that deserves higher scrutiny."" Laurean denied the rape allegation or any other sexual contact with Lauterbach. In a statement issued after her death, the Marine Corps said Laurean's denial ""was believed to significant evidence."" During a press briefing after Lauterbach's body was found, the Marines described her as a ""solid Marine"" and the fugitive Laurean as a ""stellar Marine."" Turner called the latter statement ""really unexplainable."" ""I don't know how you can be a stellar Marine and have another Marine buried in your backyard,"" he said. ""And when that statement was made, those Marines already knew of the tragedy that had befallen Maria."" Mary Lauterbach said her daughter would be proud of her persistence: ""I do this totally for her and for the protection of everyone else's daughter.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A former high school teacher in Virginia was charged Wednesday with transporting and possessing child pornography, a discovery that was made after he was accused of engaging in sexual acts with a 16-year-old male former student, according to court documents. Kevin Garfield Ricks, 50, was arrested in February at Osbourn High School in Manassas, Virginia, after authorities were notified of the alleged sexual misconduct, according to the criminal complaint filed against him Wednesday in U.S. District Court. Another student apparently reported the alleged offense to police after seeing a Facebook message from Ricks posted on the 16-year-old's Facebook page that read, ""You told me our experience was your first with a guy,"" according to the complaint. The 16-year-old student told police that Ricks committed ""several sexual acts"" on him in December after providing him with ""significant quantities of Tequila."" Authorities investigating the allegations seized Ricks' personal belongings, including the personal laptop that he carried from his Virginia home during the week to his home in Maryland on the weekends. The laptop revealed eight images of child pornography, according to the complaint. The computer also contained an online chat transcript between Ricks and another alleged victim, who accused him of molestation in the mid-'70s at a summer camp for children with disabilities where Ricks worked as a counselor. Other pornographic images were found at Ricks' home in Federalsburg, Maryland, including some that appear to have been taken in Japan in the late '80s and early '90s, when Ricks worked as an English teacher there. Most of the boys depicted in the images appear to be incapacitated, according to the complaint. An additional search of Ricks' Maryland home in April turned up ""hundreds"" of videotapes and still images of child pornography, as well as handwritten journals that ""describe sexual acts with a number of conscious and unconscious minor males at a variety of locations,"" the complaint says. After his arrest in February, Ricks told detectives that the teachers union had told him that he had been ""walking a thin line"" after a parent accused him of ""stalking"" a student he was mentoring at the Huntington Learning Center in Fauqier County, Virginia. In a written statement provided by his attorney to The Washington Post last week, Ricks said he ""will spend the rest of my days seeking forgiveness and atonement."" ""It is understandable how some may see me in a negative light, but like other people in this world, I have had many positive accomplishments in my personal life and career. I would like people to consider those as well,"" the statement said, according to the Post. Ricks is being held in the Prince William County Adult Detention Center. If convicted of the charges, he faces up to 30 years in prison.","Kevin Ricks, 50, was charged with transporting and possessing child porn .

"(CNN) -- Actor John Travolta and his legal team are dismayed that the alleged behavior of a juror led to a mistrial in the case of two people accused of attempting to extort millions from Travolta, his representative said. John Travolta, center, and his wife, Kelly Preston, enter the courthouse in the Bahamas last month. ""We are disappointed to hear about the alleged juror misconduct since we know that the Bahamian government, the court, the other jurors and John Travolta as the victim want to have this matter adjudicated through the judicial system,"" Samantha Mast said late Wednesday night. ""Mr. Travolta has and will continue to cooperate with the Bahamian authorities in the prosecution of the defendants for extortion."" The Bahamian judge said she believed someone in the jury had had inappropriate communications outside of the jury room, where jurors had been deliberating for eight hours. The judge received information that an announcement had been made at a local political rally that one of the defendants had been found not guilty. Tarino Lightbourn, a paramedic, and former Bahamian Sen. Pleasant Bridgewater -- who also is Lightbourn's lawyer -- are charged with trying to extort money from Travolta after his son Jett's death from a seizure on January 2. The money allegedly was to be paid in return for not making public a document Travolta had signed, declining to have his 16-year-old son, Jett, transported to a nearby hospital. Travolta refused a demand for money. Lightbourn and Bridgewater have pleaded not guilty. While lawyers and journalists awaited the verdict Wednesday night, they were inundated with calls from colleagues saying that someone at a rally for the Progressive Liberal Party had announced that party member Bridgewater was ""free at last."" When the courtroom doors opened to a packed crowd, the jury foreman said the jurors needed more time to deliberate. But Judge Anita Allen opted to discharge the jury. ""About two hours ago, there was an announcement at a particular political party,"" she said. ""It leaves the impression that there may have been a communication in the jury room. I am going to discharge you from returning your verdict."" She then ordered a retrial. ""We would have liked to have had a verdict so there would be closure in this case, but we prefer to have a new trial,"" said Travolta's lawyer Michael Ossi. ""We believe the evidence was very strong and convincing. The jury was deliberating for about eight hours. ... If, in fact, Tarino Lightbourn or Pleasant Bridgewater were found not guilty, a verdict would have been read hours before this announcement."" Lightbourn's lawyer Carlson Shurland expressed disappointment over the judge's ruling, saying the case has been a ""financial nightmare."" ""Unfortunately, after a lot of expenses, I'm very, very disappointed,"" he said. ""I'm confident that we would have had a favorable verdict."" Earlier in the trial, Travolta had testified that his son was found unresponsive by a nanny at home on the island of Grand Bahamas, where the family was spending the New Year's holiday. Travolta said he initially told the ambulance driver to rush them to an airport where his private jet was parked. Travolta, who is a pilot, planned to fly his son to a West Palm Beach, Florida, hospital instead of driving him to one in nearby Freeport. The actor testified that while he and his wife, actress Kelly Preston, were riding in the ambulance with their son, they decided to take the teen to the hospital, instead of flying to Florida. At the hospital, Travolta was told his son ""wasn't alive,"" he said. During the ambulance ride, Lightbourn asked Travolta to sign a statement releasing the ambulance company from liability. ""I received a liability of release document. I signed it. I did not read it. Time was of the essence,"" Travolta testified. Travolta testified that he later learned about a demand for $25 million. If he didn't pay, ""stories connected to that document would be sold to the press,"" the actor said. ""The stories would imply the death of my son was intentional and I was culpable somehow."" An attorney representing Bridgewater and Lightbourn asked Travolta whether the defendants had ever contacted or threatened him directly. Travolta said they had not and that he had heard specifics about the situation through his attorneys. Travolta's attorney Michael McDermott testified that Bridgewater had told him that the ""document would show [Travolta] killed his son or was negligent in the death of his son."" Also, McDermott told the court that Bridgewater had claimed that the form was evidence that Travolta was ""trying to flee the country with his dead son."" ""I said to Mrs. Bridgewater, 'What you are doing is a criminal offense -- it's extortion in the United States,"" McDermott testified. McDermott said he contacted authorities and later met with Bridgewater in a Nassau hotel room for a conversation secretly recorded by Bahamian police. The price for keeping the document under wraps was dropped through subsequent phone conversations. It went from $25 million to $10 million, McDermott said.

"(CNN) -- The Marine accused of killing Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach, who was more than eight months pregnant, was not the father of her unborn child, a law enforcement source close to the murder investigation said Saturday. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean, who is being held on a murder charge, is scheduled for arraignment in June. The source, who has seen a report completed earlier this month by the Defense Department's Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, said Cpl. Cesar Laurean's DNA does not match that of the unborn child, who also died. Laurean and Lauterbach were stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. An autopsy showed that Lauterbach, 20, died of blunt force trauma to the head. Police unearthed her charred body from beneath a barbecue pit in Laurean's backyard in January 2008. She disappeared the month before. Laurean was 22 when he was arrested in Mexico in April 2008. At the time, a Mexican reporter asked Laurean whether he had killed Lauterbach. The Marine replied, ""I loved her."" Laurean has been indicted on charges that include first-degree murder, financial card transaction fraud and obtaining property by false pretenses. North Carolina prosecutors allege he killed Lauterbach on December 14 and used her ATM card 10 days later before fleeing to Mexico. He holds dual citizenship in the United States and Mexico. The law enforcement source familiar with the case said a DNA swab was taken by court order from Laurean after he was extradited from Mexico in March to face charges in North Carolina. Mexican authorities agreed to the extradition, in part because prosecutors took the death penalty off the table. Mexico does not have a death penalty. Before her death, Lauterbach told the Marines that Laurean raped her. The month before she disappeared, Lauterbach's mother says Maria told a military investigator that she no longer believed Laurean was the father of her unborn child. However, Lauterbach's mother, Mary, says her daughter remained adamant that Laurean raped her. Laurean denied it. A few weeks before a scheduled rape hearing at Camp Lejeune, Lauterbach disappeared. Dewey Hudson, district attorney for Onslow County, said Laurean is scheduled for arraignment in early June, and is expected to enter a plea. ""I cannot comment on any of the tests,"" Hudson said. He would not say how the DNA results might affect his case against Laurean. Through her attorney, Mary Lauterbach said the DNA test results don't answer bigger questions she has about whether the Marines did enough to protect her daughter or moved quickly enough to investigate her claims. ""We do not believe that the result will have any effect on the continuing investigation or the trial,"" said Lauterbach's attorney Merle Wilberding.","DNA taken from suspect Cpl.

"NASSAU, Bahamas (CNN)  -- Videotapes secretly recorded by John Travolta's attorney were played Monday at the trial of two people accused of trying to extort millions of dollars from the actor after his son died in the Bahamas in January. Two people in the Bahamas stand accused of trying to extort millions from actor John Travolta. The videotapes showed what Travolta's attorney said were negotiations between himself and one of the defendants, with discussions centering on a document the suspects claimed could reflect unfavorably on Travolta's actions after his son was found unconscious. Defendants Tarino Lightbourne, a paramedic, and former Bahamian Sen. Pleasant Bridgewater are on trial on charges they plotted to extort $25 million from Travolta after 16-year-old Jett Travolta died from a seizure. Travolta attorney Michael McDermott testified Monday that he assisted police in a sting. As the videotape was played Monday, McDermott described it as depicting a meeting in a hotel room between himself and Bridgewater, who said she represented Lightbourne. Bahamian police had placed wireless microphones on McDermott and hidden two cameras in the room, McDermott said. Defense attorneys have attempted to convince the jury that Travolta's attorney came to the Bahamas to ""set up"" their clients. Murrio Ducille, who represents Bridgewater, on Friday said to Travolta's attorney, ""you came to the island with evil in your heart."" Earlier in the trial, Travolta testified that his son was found unresponsive by a nanny at their home on Grand Bahama Island, where the family was spending their New Year's holiday. Travolta said he initially told the ambulance driver to rush them to an airport where his private jet was parked and where Travolta, who is a pilot, planned to fly his son to a West Palm Beach, Florida, hospital instead of driving him to one in nearby Freeport.

"(CNN) -- John Travolta, in a letter thanking his Ocala, Florida, neighbors for sympathy shown in the wake of his teenage son's death, asked them to love their friends and family ""like there was no tomorrow."" Travolta and Kelly Preston were vacationing in the Bahamas with their children when son Jett died. The letter, addressed ""To The People of Ocala,"" said their ""comforting words, thoughts and prayers"" made an ""impossibly painful situation, a little less painful."" It was signed by Travolta, his wife, Kelly Preston, and their eight-year-old daughter, Ella. It was released by Travolta's lawyer Monday. Jett Travolta, 16, was found unconscious on January 2, while on vacation with his family in the Bahamas' West End. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival, local police said. The autopsy results have not been made public, but employees of the funeral home that handled the remains said the cause of death on the death certificate was ""seizure."" Since returning from the Bahamas, the family has remained inside the gated Jumbolair Aviation Estates -- a fly-in community on the outskirts of Ocala. ""The enormous amount of love, support and condolence we have received from this community has been most humbling,"" Travolta's letter said. ""Comforting words, thoughts and prayers of Ocala's citizens have made an impossibly painful situation, a little less painful."" Many guests for the memorial service on Thursday arrived in planes that landed on the Jumbolair runway -- big enough for Boeing 747s and behind the community gates. ""The actions of Ocala's community leaders, its law enforcement professionals, our neighbors at Jumbolair and its surrounding communities have offered us the dignity to grieve the loss of our son and Ella's brother in peace,"" the letter said. ""For this we will always be grateful."" The most visible show of sympathy was centered at the main gate, where the people left their own memorials to Jett Travolta. ""From the people who drove hours to drop off cards and flowers at our doorstep, to the service providers who made Jett's ceremony so beautiful, thank you,"" Travolta wrote. ""Every person who we have encountered has offered to do anything in their power to help us, but add that they feel powerless to do so. ""We want all of you to know that you have already helped us. By sharing our grief, you lessen our burden. For all of the people who have kept Jett in their prayers, know that those prayers have given us inspiration and strength."" The letter closed with Travolta's advice to his neighbors -- a lesson learned through the sudden loss of his son. ""In parting, we want all of you to cherish your loved ones and your friends like there was no tomorrow, to live your lives to the fullest by continuing to help one another, and to be true to yourselves.""","Jett Travolta, son of John Travolta and Kelly Preston, died January 2 .

"(CNN) -- The late Chris Benoit idolized the Dynamite Kid, who was half of a professional wrestling team famous in the 1980s for spectacular high-flying, acrobatic moves. Chris Benoit strangled his wife and suffocated his son before hanging himself in June. The Dynamite Kid and his partner, Davey Boy Smith, were known as the British Bulldogs. They were quick, agile and muscular, and in 1986 they won the World Wrestling Federation tag team championship. Young Benoit dreamed of wrestling like the Dynamite Kid, whose real name is Tom Billington. At the beginning of his career, Benoit adopted the Dynamite nickname and copied his idol's signature moves. In June, Benoit murdered his wife and young son before hanging himself. Investigators found testosterone, painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in Chris Benoit's body, Georgia's chief medical examiner said a month later. When asked about Benoit's double murder-suicide, Billington told CNN, ""It can make you aggressive, the steroids. But personally I wouldn't, you know, kill no bleeding kid, or wife either."" Billington now lives in a public housing apartment outside Manchester, England. He has lost the use of his legs. A pin sticks out from one of his toes. Billington blames his wrestling life for doing this to him -- wrestling and the fact that he ignored doctors who told him to stop the punishment to his body. And from the steroids, he said. Billington told CNN that the steroids came from doctors, from friends, even from steroids meant for horses. He took them all, took a terrible pounding in the ring, and like his partner (who died at age 39 in 2002), began taking extensive amounts of painkillers. Benoit's death has refocused a media spotlight on the organization for which he wrestled, now known as World Wrestling Entertainment, and the man who has ruled wrestling for years, Chairman of the Board Vince McMahon. McMahon, appearing with Linda McMahon, his wife and WWE CEO, told CNN: ""Nothing from the WWE, under any set of circumstances had anything to do with Chris Benoit murdering his family. How did we know Chris Benoit would turn into a monster."" Read a full transcript of the McMahons interview . Vince McMahon defended the organization, saying its drug-testing policy was not just for show. ""Our policy stacks up just as well as anyone else's in sport, although again emphasizing we are entertainment, and no one in entertainment, no one has this kind of wellness policy,"" McMahon said. Critics say McMahon pushes his stars and non-stars, works them too many nights per year and has encouraged the large physiques prevalent in modern wrestling. They say McMahon only looks at his employees as commodities, pawns in a huge business. His businesses are quite successful. About 16 million people a week tune into WWE TV shows. Two of their cable programs -- ""Raw"" and ""Friday Night Smackdown"" -- are weekly ratings giants. Pay-per-view specials generate an average of $100 million per year. When asked about the high number of former wrestlers who had died before they turned 50 years old, Vince McMahon said each person in the WWE bore responsibility for their own lives -- especially outside the arena. ""If someone passes through our organization, it is not our responsibility for someone's personal activities,"" he said. He also said there isn't ""any organization in the world, be it entertainment or be it sport, that can tell you that they are totally drug-free.""  Watch as a WWE wrestler says the perception of steroid use is wrong ¬ª . The McMahons said the WWE is taking steps toward improving its oversight of its athletes. Since the newest WWE drug screening program began in February 2006, more than 30 of the organization's wrestlers have been suspended, including two since CNN's interview with the McMahons. David Black -- who helped the NFL develop its drug program and now runs tests for the WWE -- says twice that number have tested positive and been given a warning. But Dr. Gary Wadler, a world-renowned expert in the study of drugs and athletes, says the WWE is not doing enough. ""It certainly falls far, far short of where it needs to be,"" he said. ""And there is a gold standard, and I measure all these sporting and entertainment activities against this gold standard. And [the WWE is] miles apart."" Wadler, a longtime critic of McMahon, was referring to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency in Colorado Springs, Colorado. U.S. athletes training for the Olympics are randomly tested and, if caught just once, face a two-year suspension from competition. If caught a second time, they can be banned for life. Black's programs test wrestlers four times a year. The first is a ""baseline"" test, according to the WWE. Black then tests for ""nonmedical"" uses, meaning that if an athlete has a prescription, he is cleared. ""It's just a loophole that in my mind guts the entire program,"" said Travis Tygart, who heads the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. McMahon denies that his wrestlers are pushed to use steroids. He says the average wrestler is lighter than in recent years.  Watch one of the new WWE stars talk about being ""straight edge"" ¬ª . ""There's an expression in our business, that here is where you make your money. It's your face, it's what you do with it,"" he said. ""It's your personality, it's what you do with it. It's your delivery, your elocution. It's storyline, it's things, all those things that are theatrical as well as athletic in the ring."" E-mail to a friend .

"MANILA, the Philippines (CNN) -- A debate is stirring in the predominantly Roman Catholic country of the Philippines: should the government provide contraceptives to the public? Sheila Villanueva, a 25-year-old maid with five children, said she would not use contraceptives. More than 100 members of the House of Representatives have co-authored a bill that would allow government funds to be used to promote artificial contraceptives -- which is now prohibited in the Southeast Asian nation. ""The bill is not about religion. It is not about morality,"" said Edcel Lagman, a congressman. ""It's about rights, health and sustainable human development."" Some one-third of the country's 90 million people live in poverty. The Asian Development Bank said that problem will persist until the country curbs its birth rate -- one of the highest in the world. The nationwide Pulse Asia Poll found nearly two-thirds of people support the bill. But the Catholic Church is fiercely opposed, and is pressuring lawmakers to vote against it. ""Why should we use contraceptives, teaching our children the use of contraceptives,"" said Ed Sorreta of Pro-Life Philippines. ""It's totally against the teaching of the Catholic Church. The poverty is really caused by other issues, moral values."" ""When you talk about natural family planning, it needs discipline, that's where many couples fail. They lack the discipline."" Abortion is illegal in the Philippines, except in cases to save a mother's life. But the United Nations estimates that half a million illegal abortions are performed in the country every year. Sheila Villanueva, a 25-year-old maid earning $2 a day, has five children. ""I married at eighteen. I had my first baby by the time I was nineteen. Then the babies came, one after the other,"" she said. ""Life is so hard, kids get sick easily, prices of goods are so high. That's one of the reasons why I don't want them to have too many kids,"" she said. Still, Villanueva said she would not use contraceptives. ""Even if they say you'll end up with too many kids, I don't get swayed by their persuasions, I won't use those contraceptives,"" she said. The legislation will go before the nation's Congress in the next few months. ""This bill, once it becomes a law, it will give information and access to those who want it,"" Lagman said. ""But I will also underscore that central to this bill is the freedom of choice. ... (W)e compel women to make their own choices."" ""(T)he government should be there to give them free information and free access to the products, particularly to the poorer of the poor,"" he added.","More than 100 lawmakers back a bill to use government funds for contraceptives .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Eleven-year-old Hiroki Ando will likely die if he does not get a new heart. Hiroki in an ambulance on the way to catch his flight to New York, where he will wait for a heart. Hiroki suffers from cardiomyopathy, which inflames and impairs the heart. The same disease killed his sister five years ago. ""We have two children in our family who got a disease that happens one out of every 100,000 people. I am sorry for my children. We are having my daughter and Hiroki going through this harsh experience,"" said father Ryuki Ando. ""We were told by his doctor at the end of last year that the heart transplant operation was the only way for him to survive,"" Ando said. But the law in Japan prohibits anyone under the age of 15 from donating organs -- meaning Hiroki can't get a new heart in his home country. According to the web site for Japan Transplant Network, a non-governmental group that supports changing Japan's transplant law, ""this stipulation has greatly reduced the possibility of transplants to small children; heart transplants to small children have become impossible.""  Watch Hiroki's trip to the United States ¬ª . Lawmaker Taro Kono is spearheading efforts to change the law, which was enacted in 1997. Japan's parliament is now debating four proposed amendments-- including one that would scrap the age limit. But, beyond the age matter, the issue of organ transplantation in general, has been a difficult one for the country because of perceptions of brain death. Some refuse to accept it if their loved ones' hearts are still beating. ""For a long time, it's the heart that mattered in Japan. Some religions ask us not to declare being brain dead as death. But that is not the majority,"" Kono said. ""So it is simply that we have been doing things this way and a lot of people are very skeptical about it."" Kono, who gave a kidney to his father, said a total of 81 organ transplants have been conducted in Japan since the transplant law was enacted in 1997, whereas nearly thousands of transplants occur in the United States each year. ""A lot of people in Japan waiting for a transplant, waiting for a liver, a heart, other organs, most of them just die simply because they couldn't get any organs,"" he said. Kono said he believes the public supports changing the law to allow organ donation from children, noting that ""when the parents of the child are going on the street asking for donations, they can actually raise more than a million dollars."" Incredibly, that's just what Hiroki's family has done. They started a group called ""helping Hiroki"" and raised $1.7 million in donations. ""It was very tough to get the donations, but so many people from all over Japan donated the money,"" he said. ""It was not only the money, but so many letters and messages to energize us, sent to the group. We realized there are so many people supporting us, and they are the reason that we made it this far and will be able to continue after going to the U.S."" Hiroki is now at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, awaiting a new heart. His father says he knows that the transplant issue is a difficult one for families. ""The honest wish from the recipient's side is to have a donor show up as soon as possible,"" he said, pausing. ""I still do not know whether I can make a decision to give my child's heart to someone else if I am faced with such a situation. But unless the people face the issue and think about it seriously, I do not think the time will come soon to see more people volunteering to donate organs."" Ando said he hopes that one day he will be able to play baseball with his son, who is an avid sports fan. ""I would like to have a fun time again with Hiroki. I would like to make it home with everyone in good health,"" he said. ""That's the biggest hope I have now."" Ando's mother wrote in a blog on her Web site (http://www.hirokikun.jp/) that Hiroki was high on the waiting list for a heart transplant in New York. ""I believe Hiroki will be all right,"" she wrote.","Hiroki Ando, 11, suffers from cardiomyopathy, which inflames and impairs the heart .

"(CNN) -- Death Cab for Cutie, the Grammy-nominated indie band that shot to the top of the Billboard charts with its latest album, ""Narrow Stairs,"" has come a long way since its basement-recording beginnings in Bellingham, Washington. Chris Walla, left, and Nick Harmer of indie band Death Cab for Cutie discuss their newly released EP. Together for more than 10 years and formed while its members attended Western Washington University, the band has six studio albums behind them, their songs have graced popular TV and film soundtracks, and their sell-out tours have brought the musicians all over the globe. But the success is not something the group takes for granted. ""We never got into this for world domination. There were never designs to be 'rock stars,' "" said Chris Walla, guitarist and producer. ""The fact that I get to make a living doing something that I just passionately love to do is something that I wake up every day and am thankful for,"" added Nick Harmer, bass player. ""It's not lost on me; it really isn't. It's phenomenal."" Death Cab for Cutie, which is named after a song performed by the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band in the 1967 Beatles film ""Magical Mystery Tour,"" released ""The Open Door EP"" last month. It's a compilation of tracks that didn't find a home on ""Narrow Stairs"" but that the band didn't want to lose forever. Days before their most recent tour cycle ended and before the summer tour begins, Walla and Harmer -- two of the band's four members -- sat down with CNN to discuss the latest EP, the current bands that move them and the darkness that may or may not drive their music. CNN: Talk to me about the band's name, which was selected by Ben Gibbard, Death Cab for Cutie's founder. If you could turn back the clock, would you go with something different? Chris Walla: [Ben] was in a ""Magical Mystery Tour"" all-the-time kind of phase. He made a grand proclamation from the couch at one point that if he ever had another band, he was going to call it Death Cab for Cutie. Nick Harmer: Knowing what we know now, Ben has said that he would love to have shortened it somehow to a snappier name. We joke about changing it. CNN: To what? Chris Walla: Exactly! All the band names are taken. CNN: Why release an EP (extended play; more than a single but less than a full-on album) right now? Is it a taste of things to come? Harmer: We've always treated the EP as kind of a side dish to the main course during an album cycle. These are songs that were recorded at the same time as the songs that made the album ""Narrow Stairs."" They're sort of part of this chapter of the band. For us, it's a nice way to have some new songs to play on tour, kind of get some new material in the world and keep things interesting. We recorded them. They were finished. It would be kind of weird to leave them on a reel someplace. CNN: How has the state of the economy, if at all, affected your tour and plans? Walla: This tour has done really, really well for us. If anything, I think that we're more mindful of just the fact that in a world of so many entertainment choices how amazing it really is to be on a really successful, solid, good tour. Harmer: We really haven't seen an impact. I expected there to be one, to be honest, but all the numbers are pretty consistent with all the touring numbers we've ever done. CNN: Let's talk a bit about the persona of indie rock musicians: the depression, the melancholy, the darkness. What do your parents make of this? Are there any issues you'd like to discuss? Walla: Our parents are all terrible people. We all came from broken homes. (laugh) Harmer: We cry a whole lot ... (laugh) Walla: It's not by design. We have great families. We have great homes. It's sort of hard to explain, I guess. ... We do this because music totally moves us in a complete and absolute sort of way. It ends up just coming out in heart-on-your-sleeve, heavy, sort of really personal ways. Harmer: I've always felt like it's more about the bittersweet qualities of life than it is about the dark brooding. ... It's more about just being honest about the different stations that you find yourself in in life. CNN: What bands are you listening to these days? Who do you really like? Harmer: That's the thing about being on the road with so many people that are music fans. There's always a new record that someone's found that we're listening to. Ben is really kind of always combing through old records. I think [Walla] and I probably do more on the what's new and what's out in the world. The Gaslight Anthem, I hear them all the time now. Walla: Yeah, the Gaslight Anthem record's great. There's a band from Seattle called the Lonely Forest whose record I just picked up. They're a new band, it came out few weeks ago, and that's totally doing it for me right now. ... Telekinesis from Seattle, the new Metric record I think is great. Those are the big ones right now. CNN: Tell me about your political involvement and your backing of causes. (Walla, for example, got involved in the Obama campaign and has done some work for PETA.) Walla: It's little things here and there, which is sort of how I feel activism should work. You can't do everything all the time, but you can do what you can when you can. I wish I could do more, but ... not everybody can be Bono.","Death Cab for Cutie, the Grammy-nominated indie band, has a new EP .

"Editor's note: Kiron K. Skinner is an associate professor of international relations at Carnegie Mellon University, directs the university's International Relations and Politics Program, and is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. She is the co-author, along with Serhiy Kudelia, Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Condoleezza Rice, of ""The Strategy of Campaigning: Lessons from Ronald Reagan and Boris Yeltsin."" Kiron Skinner says the Nobel Committee recognizes the predominant power of the United States. (CNN) -- As an American of African descent, I swelled with pride when I heard that the Norwegian Nobel Committee selected President Obama to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. The award further validates what the 2008 presidential election demonstrated: The United States is the most mature and fully functioning multi-ethnic democracy in the world. Despite its emphasis on multilateralism, the Norwegian Nobel Committee's statement also recognizes the predominant power of the United States. The accepted wisdom among diplomats is that the international system is multipolar because of the increasingly multilateral governance structure of the world's numerous international institutions. In reality, however, the United States is by far the single greatest economic, military and political power on earth. Furthermore, many international institutions are dependent upon the United States for their survival. Announcing the award, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said ""multilateral diplomacy has regained a central position, with emphasis on the role that the United Nations and other international institutions can play."" The Committee thus joins a chorus of international forums that contend that multilateralism is the hallmark of the international system. Today there are more formal and informal international institutions than ever before, and they share a common theme. Leaders attending the G-20 summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on September 24-25 declared that the G-20, a collection of advanced economies and fast-growing developing economies, would replace the G-7/G-8, the long-standing group of advanced economies, as the ""premier forum for our international economic cooperation."" This decision is seen in no small measure as bowing to pressure from states such as Brazil, China and India that have powerhouse economies but have been left out of key international economic meetings such as the G-8, which includes the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada and Russia. The G-20 leaders also agreed to increase the voting power of developing countries in the World Bank by at least 3 percent and to shift the quota share in the International Monetary Fund from developed countries to countries in economic transition by at least 5 percent. The Nobel Committee's sentiment was expressed at the G-8 summit in L'Aquila, Italy, in July when the G-8 countries joined with the G-5 (Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and South Africa), Egypt and the European Union to declare: ""Our purpose is to foster a genuine partnership, in the context of a strengthened multilateralism."" That is similar to what BRIC -- Brazil, Russia, India, and China -- stated at its first summit on June 16 in Yekaterinburg, Russia: ""We underline our support for a more democratic and just multipolar world order based on the rule of international law, equality, mutual respect, cooperation, coordinated action and collective decision-making of all states. ... We express our strong commitment to multilateral diplomacy with the United Nations playing the central role in dealing with global challenges and threats."" The very next day, the members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) put the matter more starkly as they concluded their summit: ""The tendency towards true multipolarity is irreversible."" An increasing number of regional and international institutions with evolving memberships and leadership are multilateral. The world, however, is not multipolar. Consider some important facts: the United States has the largest gross domestic product defined in terms of purchasing power parity of any single state in the world; it is surpassed in GDP only by the European Union, a collection of states; and its GDP is twice that of China, its nearest competitor. The United States accounts for approximately half of the world's defense spending and it provides extended military deterrent cover for many of its allies, especially European. Whether it is the subject of positive or negative international public opinion, the United States is a major source of cultural, political and social power in the world. In its recently released Global Competiveness Report, the World Economic Forum placed the United States just behind top-ranked Switzerland, hardly a nation best positioned to lead the global economy. It is reasonable to expect that the United States will soon regain the number-one position it held in earlier World Economic Forum competitiveness reports. International political, economic and military realities are not changed merely by declaring that they are something different from what they are. I believe the Nobel Committee knows this better than those writing communiqu√©s for the various international institutions. The Committee asserts that President Obama has ""created a new climate in international politics."" In other words, it recognizes the United States' predominant global power -- power that does not appear to be diminishing and that is capable of shaping many of the multilateral institutions that depend on it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kiron K. Skinner.","Kiron Skinner: It's become fashionable to talk of a ""multipolar"" world .

"(AOL Autos) -- If you don't eat, sleep and breathe cars, or devour car magazines in minute detail, there's a good chance you don't know all the technological terms that pop up in the media, new car advertising and literature. With new models being released all the time, the acronyms can be overwhelming. With every new model year, it seems, there are new technology and acronyms. Here's a concise list of the terms you're most likely to see and read about in the 2008 literature. ABS: The most common passive safety system found on cars today is ABS or anti-lock brake system. ABS continuously counts wheel revolutions electronically and when one or more wheels stops moving during a skid, the system quickly applies and releases the brakes on the skidding wheels. This is done so that the tires continue to rotate and the car can be steered around an object or an impending accident situation. Tires that are skidding can't do much steering. ALS: This is a relatively new term that stands for active lighting system or automatic lighting system. On some luxury vehicles, you can opt for headlamps that turn left or right (up to about 15 degrees) as the front tires turn to light the road as you make your turns. AWD (also FWD, RWD, 2WD, 4WD): These terms refer to how many and which wheels on your car deliver power from the engine to the road surface. AWD means all-wheel drive and generally means there are no buttons, levers or lower gear ranges. These systems can be full-time, driving all four wheels all the time, or part-time, controlled by computers when conditions dictate the need for more traction. The 4WD label means four-wheel drive and these part-time systems usually have a selector switch or lever to select two-wheel drive, four-wheel drive or even four-wheel drive in a lower gear or locked position for very difficult driving situations. In 2WD, only the two front or rear tires have power. Traditional RWD or rear-wheel drive is almost always found on luxury cars, sports cars, or racing cars. FWD or front-wheel drive is more compact and is more often found on small cars, minivans and crossover vehicles. DOHC: Engineering shorthand for double-overhead camshaft. A DOHC engine has one camshaft that opens the intake valves and one camshaft that opens the exhaust valves, a design derived from racing engines. DOHC engines are more complex than single-overhead-cam engines (SOHC) and overhead-valve engines (OHV) but generally make more power and torque at higher rpm levels because they let the engine breathe better. EBD: An acronym given to the ABS subsystem called electronic brake force distribution. EBD is rapidly becoming standard equipment on cars that already have ABS brakes. In a panic braking situation, EBD distributes the most braking force to the tires that have the most traction. This helps to keep the car from spinning and reduces stopping distances on slippery surfaces. ESC/ESP: Electronic stability control or electronic stability program are interchangeable terms for the same software and hardware. An extension of ABS, ESC uses sensors and computers to determine whether a vehicle is oversteering (rear wheels out) or understeering (front wheels not turning in the desired direction). ESC/ESP reduces engine power and/or applies one of the front or rear brakes to get the vehicle back into its intended path of travel. As a means of protecting against rollover accidents, ESC will be required on all new light vehicles sold in America by September 2011. GPS: All automotive navigation systems communicate with Global Positioning System or GPS satellites. GPS satellites were launched into orbit by the U.S. Department of Defense but are now used by motorists, hikers and explorers all over the world. GPS systems are accurate anywhere in the world from 10 to 50 feet. Combined with a CD or DVD map in the vehicle's navigation system, the satellites can track latitude, longitude, altitude and direction of travel in all weather conditions. I6 (also V6, V8, V10, W12, H4): These terms refer to the number and physical arrangement of cylinders in the engine. The I stands for inline, and means that the cylinders are lined up in a single row, (I4, I5, and I6, usually). V engines have two rows or banks of cylinders in a V pattern, with three, four, five or even six cylinders per bank, hence V-6, V-8, V-10, and V-12. The W engine used by Audi and VW has three rows of cylinders, in this case four cylinders, making it a W-12. Other engine designs include H-4 and H-6 engines, horizontally opposed or flat engines with either two or three cylinders on each side, a design used by Porsche (engine in the rear) and Subaru (engine in the front). The oddball engine on the U.S. market is the Wankel, a rotary engine used only in the Mazda RX-8. It has no cylinders, no banks and no reciprocating parts. L (as in 1.8L or 3.5L): L is for liters a metric measurement of engine size, also called displacement or swept volume, which has replaced cubic inches in the U.S. industry. It's the total volume of all the engine's cylinders. Smaller engines generally generate less power and use less fuel, larger engines make more and use more, so don't buy more engine than you need. RSC: One of the newest government regulations proposed for vehicles in the near future is protection against rollover accidents. The system that the industry has created to combat those is generally called roll stability control. RSC uses computers and sensors to analyze vehicle speed, steering wheel angle and body angle. If it senses that the vehicle is about to roll over, it cuts engine power and applies the brakes on one side or the other to bring the vehicle back to a stable position. TCS: Like ABS brakes, traction control systems are becoming more widely available, even on low-priced cars, because they add so much safety. A traction control system takes data from the ABS about tire rotation and compares the information in the computer. If one or two of the tires are spinning faster than they should be, indicating a loss of traction, the TCS system can cut engine power or engine torque going to the tires and apply brakes individually until the tires are all rotating at the same speed again. TPMS: This is a relatively new acronym that stands for tire-pressure monitoring system. The federal government has mandated that all vehicles in the future should have these systems to protect vehicles and occupants from rollovers and other accidents caused by low or deflating tires. Some currently available systems work by sending radio messages from each tire to the warning on the instrument panel. Others infer from the ABS system that one or more tires has a different rolling diameter, because it is going flat, than the other three tires and sends a warning to the instrument panel. VVT: Engineering term that stands for variable valve timing. Until a few years ago, timing the opening and closing of the engine's valves was a purely mechanical function and could not be varied. VVT systems use a combination of computers, engine oil pressure and mechanical linkages to change valve timing so that the engine idles smoothly, produces lots of power and torque when needed and burns fuel cleanly and economically.","Most common car safety system is ABS or anti-lock brake system .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- The second of two men who last month pulled off a daring escape from a county jail in New Jersey was taken into custody Wednesday, authorities told CNN. Otis Blunt, 32, was arrested in Mexico City, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. He will be transported back to the United States as soon as possible, probably within 24 hours, authorities said. Mexico has no extradition proceedings. On Tuesday, local and federal authorities captured Jose Espinosa, 20, who broke out of Union County Jail on December 15 along with Blunt. Espinosa and Blunt escaped by digging a hole through the cinder block wall of their adjoining cells, and hid the hole by using posters of bikini-clad women. The two then jumped onto a roof and over a 25-foot-high razor wire fence onto a railroad bed. Authorities said Espinosa might have injured his foot making those jumps. Authorities traced Blunt to Mexico City, where he was hiding in a $10-a-night hotel, said Commander Lenny DePaul of the New York/New Jersey Regional Fugitive Task Force. They spotted him when he looked out a window. Marshals and Mexican authorities then converged on the hotel room, DePaul said. A written statement from marshals identified the hotel as the Hotel Zomara. Blunt, who was arrested without incident, was in a holding cell Wednesday afternoon, DePaul said. Marshals said Blunt was in the custody of the Mexican immigration agency and is awaiting its determination about his deportation. ""Since the day of his escape, right through the holidays, apprehending this guy has been the highest-priority case,"" DePaul said in the statement. In recent days, Blunt had spoken with the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist, to help negotiate his surrender. Sharpton traveled to Mexico City, where he said he was led to believe Blunt would give himself up Tuesday. But that surrender did not occur, and Sharpton left the country Wednesday morning. Police believe it took two weeks for Espinosa and Blunt to chisel out two cinder blocks -- one between the cells and a second to the wall outside, using a valve wheel one of the men took from a pipe. Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow said it isn't clear why no one heard the digging, as a reenactment conducted by his office showed it would be loud. When the men made the jumps, they were wearing flip-flops and had wrapped their feet in sheets, the prosecutor said. The sheeting strips were found by authorities later. Acting on a tip, authorities found Espinosa about 9 p.m. Tuesday in an apartment six blocks from the jail, said James Plousis, a U.S. marshal for New Jersey. Espinosa was alone in the residence and was lying on a couch with his foot raised. Investigators said they also arrested a ""female associate"" of Espinosa. They identified her as 19-year-old Odalys Cortez of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, and said in a news release that they plan to file criminal charges against her. During their escape, Blunt and Espinosa left behind dummies in their jail beds, along with a note naming prison guard Rudolph Zurick. It thanked him ""for the tools needed,"" and said, ""You're A real Pal! Happy Holidays."" Zurick committed suicide last week at his home in Sayreville, New Jersey. His attorney, Michael Mitzner, said Zurick had not been charged in the jail break and was cooperating with investigators. ""It's possible that his name being associated with the escape was more than he could take, despite his lack of involvement,"" Mitzner said. As Espinosa, wearing a sleeveless black T-shirt, khaki pants and slippers, was led into Union County police headquarters Tuesday night, a reporter asked him about the guard's death. ""It wasn't our fault,"" he said. Espinosa recently pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter and was to be sentenced January 25, authorities said. He faced a minimum of 17 years in prison. Blunt was in prison in lieu of $75,000 bail for weapons and robbery charges. Both men were being housed in the multilevel jail's high-security area, officials said. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Deborah Feyerick, Susan Chun and Jason Carroll contributed to this report.","Otis Blunt was captured Wednesday in Mexico City, officials said .

"(CNN) -- Will Bunch's CNN.com tirade earlier this week against television host Glenn Beck and David Barton -- the founder and president of WallBuilders, a national pro-family organization that emphasizes history's ""moral, religious and constitutional heritage"" -- for allegedly creating ""pseudo history"" reveals more about Mr. Bunch than it does about what Mr. Beck and Mr. Barton are presenting. Mr. Bunch seems, above all, to be annoyed that many people are no longer staying on the liberal plantation of secularized American history. He offers little in the way of examples of error, just differences of opinion, such as his own assertion about ""the much-debunked idea that America's creation was rooted in Christianity."" Much debunked? That would have been news to many of the Founding Fathers, whose biblical understanding of man as created in the image of God informed their insistence in the Declaration of Independence that people have ""unalienable rights"" to ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" This was tempered by the biblically informed idea that man is prone to sin. In the Federalist Papers, No. 51, for example, James Madison wrote, ""But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary."" Therefore, any government formed by men needs checks and balances to avoid tyranny. On a more elementary level, the signers of the Declaration and the Constitution were mostly Christian. You can look it up. Bunch complains that, ""In April, Barton told Beck's 3 million TV viewers that 'we use the Ten Commandments as basis of civil law and the Western world [and it] has been for 2,000 years.' "" Glenn Beck rewrites civil rights history . Perhaps this is why the Ten Commandments numerals are represented at the bottom of a door to the U.S. Supreme Court courtroom and why Moses, revered as the lawgiver to Jews in the Hebrew bible, and Christians in the New Testament, appears holding two tablets elsewhere in the Supreme Court building. He appears between the Chinese philosopher Confucius and Solon, the Athenian statesman -- at the center of a frieze of historic lawgivers on the building's East Pediment. Moses is also among an array of lawgiver figures depicted over the Court's chamber. Tellingly, Mr. Bunch does not dispute the accuracy of the quotes that Mr. Barton cites that spell out a Christian understanding of law and man among some of the Founding Fathers. In a letter to Thomas Jefferson, written 37 years after the Declaration of Independence, John Adams wrote: ""The general principles, on which the Fathers achieved independence, were the only Principles in which that beautiful Assembly of young gentlemen could Unite. ... And what were these general Principles? I answer, the general Principles of Christianity, in which all these Sects were United: ... Now I will avow, that I then believe, and now believe, that those general Principles of Christianity, are as eternal and immutable, as the Existence and Attributes of God; and that those Principles of Liberty, are as unalterable as human Nature and our terrestrial, mundane System."" John Jay, the first chief justice of the Supreme Court, wrote in a letter to a friend, ""Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers, and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and interest of our Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers."" Mr. Bunch further complains that Barton ""gives less than short shrift to the real achievement of the Founders in separating church and state."" I would argue that their real achievement was elsewhere. Their real achievement was far larger: creation of  a unique, limited government with protections for the freedoms of religion, speech, press and assembly and protection of  property rights, without which no freedom exists. The result was the most prosperous and freest nation in history. And property rights are endorsed throughout the Bible. The ""wall of separation between church & state,"" by the way, is not in the Constitution. It's from a letter from President Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury, Connecticut, Baptists, who were concerned that the national government would favor one Christian denomination over others. But Mr. Jefferson's  phrase has become a sacred totem used by activist judges to drive Christian symbols from the public square. The real reason that Mr. Bunch is so exercised is that the truth about America's Christian founding is getting out, despite media hostility, politically correct schoolbooks and rising intolerance toward any public expression of faith -- unless it advances leftist goals. America is a unique beacon of freedom precisely because of its founders' Christian perspective, which has protected the right of conscience and thus freedom of religion for Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and nonbelievers. Try to identify another nation on Earth that similarly advanced individual rights without being influenced by Christianity. Beck and Barton are striking what Abraham Lincoln described in a different context as the ""mystic chords of memory."" It makes perfect sense that many Americans are tuning in. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Knight.","Robert Knight disputes ideas in opinion piece by Will Bunch about Glenn Beck, David Barton .
Bunch rejected idea of U.S.' Christian roots, but there's evidence for it, Knight says .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- At least one Afghan Taliban leader has been seized in neighboring Pakistan by security forces, sources told CNN Thursday. Mullah Abdul Salam was arrested last week, according to Afghan government officials, Taliban sources and a U.S. official. ""The Taliban is down another shadow governor,"" the American source said late Wednesday, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the information. The news came against the background of an intensified U.S.-led campaign against insurgents on both sides of the border. Taliban fighters are resisting an allied military push into area they control in Helmand province in the south of Afghanistan, a military operation called Moshtarak. According to British Maj. Gen. Nick Carter, it will the NATO-led force ""another 25 to 30 days to secure that which needs to be secured"" in the region, and a further three months after that to be sure insurgents are being kept out. But Operation Moshtarak has reached ""the end of the beginning,"" he said in a briefing from Afghanistan broadcast by the Pentagon Channel. ""The insurgent was entirely dislocated within 24 hours"" of the insertion of troops by helicopter, he said. The Nad-e Ali district is ""broadly secure,"" he said, but there is still Taliban resistance in Marjah. ""It will be some days before we can be completely confident that Marjah is secure,"" said Carter, the International Security Assistance Force's head of Regional Command South. Ten civilians were killed on the second day of the operation, he said. Reports at the time said 12 were killed. ""They (Taliban) know this is their last stronghold. They're not backing down,"" CNN's Atia Abawi reported from the battlefield, where she is embedded with U.S. Marines. The crackle of small arms fire and the whoosh of outgoing mortar rounds from the Marines were clearly audible on the line as she described the battle. ""About five minutes ago Taliban started attacking our area,"" she said shortly before 8 a.m. ET. ""The Taliban are not giving up -- they seem to be coming out in squads, (but) they know they can't group together in large numbers"" because it would make them easier targets. The Taliban seem to include ""foreign fighters who will fight to the death,"" she said. Across the border in Pakistan, four people were killed and five were wounded Thursday when a drone fired on a suspected militant compound in Pakistan's tribal region, intelligence sources and a local political official told CNN. The four who were killed were suspected militants, two intelligence officials told CNN. It was not clear whether the wounded were also militants. The remote-controlled aircraft fired two missiles at the compound, which is in the Danday Darpakhel area of North Waziristan, one of seven districts in the tribal region along the Afghan border, the sources said. They asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media. The U.S. military does not comment on reported attacks by the pilotless aircraft, but the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones. Mullah Salam, the Taliban commander, was arrested in Pakistan, the Afghan government and Taliban sources agree, but they named different cities as the location of his capture. Gov. Muhammad Omar of Afghanistan's Kunduz province said Thursday he was detained in Quetta -- where the Afghan Taliban reportedly has its leadership councils. The Taliban sources said he was nabbed in Faisalabad. Salam is believed to be the Taliban commander for Kunduz province, Omar said. He was directing Taliban military operations in the province, including ordering terrorist actions, mine planting and suicide attacks, said Abdul Razaq Yaqubi, the chief of police in Kunduz. Yaqubi said Salam and another Taliban ""shadow governor,"" Mullah Salih, were arrested in the Pakistani city of Peshawar last week. He said the information came from Pakistani authorities. Salih was the shadow governor of Baghlan province, the police chief said. There was no immediate confirmation of Salih's arrest. Word of Salam's arrest comes days after news of the capture of the Afghan Taliban's reputed second-in-command, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. Taliban sources and Omar said several other suspected members of the Afghan Taliban were arrested with Salam, but their identities are not clear. CNN's Pam Benson in Washington, journalist Mati Matiullah in Kabul, and journalists Nasir Dawar and Umar Aziz Khan in Islamabad, Pakistan, contributed to this report.","Mullah Abdul Salam arrested last week, according to Afghan, U.S. sources .

"The statistics are sobering: Heart disease is the number-one killer of women in the United States. And an estimated 8 million women have it. What's more, a new study shows that in recent years the overall heart disease risk for Americans -- especially women -- hasn't continued the healthy downward trend it showed in previous decades. There are steps you can take, at any age, to prevent heart disease, the #1 killer of US women. Ready for some good news? You can do more to prevent heart disease than almost any other serious condition. Start with these age-specific steps. The 30s . Declare a trans fat-free zone. Commonly used to extend the shelf life of packaged foods like cookies and crackers, and also found in margarine, trans fats pack a double whammy: they raise bad cholesterol (LDL), while lowering good, protective HDL (your LDL should be below 100; your HDL, above 60). In a Harvard University study, women with the highest level of trans fats in their blood had triple the risk of heart disease. Take a cue from major U.S. cities like New York and Philadelphia (which have banned trans fats from restaurants), and pitch them out of your pantry. On ingredient lists, they show up as ""hydrogenated"" and ""partially hydrogenated"" oils. But scrutinize any product touted as ""trans fat-free"" at the supermarket, too: some manufacturers have replaced hydrogenated oils with tropical oils that are high in saturated fat, which also raises LDL cholesterol. Eating out in a city where trans fats aren't banned? Skip the fried stuff -- many restaurants still use the oils for frying. Health.com: 10 best foods for your heart . Use your OB-GYN as a partner. During your prime reproductive years, you may visit your OB-GYN more than you go to your regular doctor. Make sure you talk to her about your heart as well as gynecological health, particularly because blood pressure (BP) can rise if you're taking birth control pills or when you're pregnant. Women who develop preeclampsia (pregnancy-related hypertension) are prone to heart disease later in life. And, in general, ""how your heart handles pregnancy offers a snapshot of how it will look in middle age,"" says Sharonne Hayes, M.D., director of the Women's Heart Clinic at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. To keep BP from creeping up (the safe zone is lower than 120 over 80), substitute herbs and spices for salt -- try cumin for a healthy twist on popcorn, for instance. Simmer down. If you boil over when the shopper in front of you has 16 grocery items in the 15-or-fewer lane, beware: Losing your temper can damage your arteries, according to research by C. Noel Bairey Merz, M.D., director of the Women's Heart Center and endowed chair in Women's Health at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles, California. ""Raging causes your blood pressure to surge and stay up there,"" Merz says. That's why it's crucial to get a grip on anger at an early age, before it takes a toll. Learn now that, instead of venting when a situation makes you furious, you can take a few deep breaths and describe to yourself what's making you angry. That should help you calm down. The 40s . Don't skimp on sleep. When your hormones are fluctuating madly, it can be tough to nod off. It's no wonder, then, that more than half if women in their 40s suffer from insomnia at least a few nights a week. That's nothing to yawn about, either. When your body is deprived of restorative sleep, your heart has to work harder. And piles of studies show that too little shut-eye can lead to heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and diabetes. How little is too little? A recent study in the Archives of Internal Medicine suggests that less than seven-and-a-half hours per night puts you at risk for heart disease. And recent research from Duke University found that women who take more than a half-hour to fall asleep or those who awaken frequently during the night have inflammation in their arteries and higher levels of insulin, two major risk factors for heart disease. The soporific Rx: Do your best to unwind with a relaxing bedtime routine, like listening to soothing music or soaking in a tub with bath salts. And, despite how difficult it might sound, obey this rule: no technology or work in the bedroom; your bed should be for sleep and sex only. Monitor your mood. Between the demands of work and family, it's easy to worry that something will fall through the cracks -- but don't let that something be your own peace of mind. Perimenopausal women have nearly double the risk for depression, and that spells trouble for their hearts, says Jennifer Mieres, M.D., a cardiologist and associate professor at New York University's School of Medicine. Uncontrolled stress can raise blood pressure and flood blood vessels with inflammatory chemicals, which in high doses can be toxic to the heart, while depression has been linked to hardening of the arteries. Then there are the unhealthy habits that come with stress and the blues: smoking, excessive drinking, and overeating. Smart medicine for your mood and your heart? Exercise. Thirty minutes of aerobic activity (walking, biking, swimming) most days of the week has been shown to reduce the symptoms of depression by about half, an effect comparable to antidepressant use, while lowering blood pressure and strengthening your cardiovascular system. But if you're feeling low more often than not, talk to your doctor about therapy, antidepressants, or St. John's wort. (New research suggests that this herb works as well as antidepressants and has few side effects.) Health.com: How safe, moderate exercise can keep your heart healthy . Get more fish, flaxseed, and fiber. In your 40s, as estrogen dips, your blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides (a type of fat stored in the blood) start creeping up, making a heart-healthy menu more important than ever. Aim for two servings of fish, like salmon or tuna, each week for omega-3 fats; or pick omega-3-fortified foods like orange juice, margarine, and eggs. Also, sprinkle ground flaxseed on yogurt or cottage cheese to lower cholesterol. And experiment with dishes that contain high-fiber foods like apples, broccoli, beans, and bran cereal. Health fads come and go, but a high-fiber diet has consistently proven to be good for the heart, says Leslie Cho, M.D., director of the Women's Cardiovascular Center at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. Health.com: Recipes to help you 'fill up on fiber' The 50s plus . Whittle your waist. If a few extra pounds have settled around your middle since menopause, you're not alone. ""Basically, we start putting on weight more like men,"" says Nieca Goldberg, M.D., medical director of New York University's Women's Heart Program and author of Complete Guide to Women's Health. The ""meno potbelly"" is especially hard on the heart because it builds up around internal organs, triggers inflammation, and leads to insulin resistance. Research from the famous Nurses' Health Study found that women with a waist circumference of more than 35 inches were twice as likely to die of heart disease than women with a 28-inch waist, regardless of weight. Low-intensity workout routines can help slow down the belly buildup, but to shrink it you'll need to work up a sweat with 60 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least three times a week. Try jogging, walking on the treadmill on a challenging incline, or swimming laps. Enjoy some ""friend benefits."" Whatever causes you stress, leaning on friends for support and commiseration can help keep blood pressure in check. ""There are clearly good things that happen to your heart when you care about people and people care about you,"" Cedars-Sinai's Merz says. Talk out the stress with friends over a walk or at the gym, and you'll double your heart benefit. Stay strong. Since hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is no longer thought to protect your heart, and may even harm it (talk to your doctor about the risks if you decide to try it), you need to safeguard your heart with strong muscles. Add strength training -- like a weight-lifting class, yoga, or Pilates -- to your exercise routine at least twice a week, Goldberg recommends. You'll keep blood pressure in check, boost metabolism, zap more calories, control cholesterol, and improve endurance. Health.com: Strength exercises for any age . Sum total?

"(CNN) -- Sending a letter will soon be a little more expensive, the U.S. Postal Service announced Tuesday. The U.S. Postal Service announced Tuesday a 2-cent increase on first-class stamps, effective May 11. The price for a first-class mail stamp will increase 2 cents to 44 cents, starting May 11. The Postal Service said the price increase was necessary because of rising production costs. Under law, the price of stamps is not allowed to rise faster than the U.S. consumer price index, which measures inflation. According to a written release, the increase will cost the typical family about $3 a year. ""Whether you're a consumer or run a business, the Postal Service continues to offer a good deal during a time when we're all looking for ways to save,"" said spokesman Stephen M. Kearney.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Dozens of schoolgirls and teachers were sickened Wednesday by poison gas in Afghanistan, medical and government officials said. The latest incident, this one at a high school, is the ninth such case involving the poisoning of schoolgirls, said Asif Nang, spokesman for the nation's education ministry. Dr. Kabir Amiri said 59 students and 14 teachers were brought to the hospital, and were faring better. ""We don't have good equipment to verify the kind of gas that they were poisoned with, but we have taken their blood tests to send to Turkmenistan for verifying the type of gas"" that was used, Amiri said. Many Afghan girls were not allowed to attend school during the Taliban's rule from 1996 to 2001. Girls' schools began reopening after the Islamist regime was toppled. The United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, estimates that 2 million Afghan girls attend school these days. But female educational facilities, students and teachers have come under vicious attack as the insurgency has strengthened and spread from Taliban strongholds in the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand. A report compiled last year by the humanitarian agency CARE documented 670 education-related attacks in 2008, including murder and arson. Much of the violence in what CARE called an ""alarming trend"" occurred at girls' schools. CNN's Matiullah Mati contributed to this report.","Under Taliban rule, girls were banned from schools .

"Oxford, England (CNN) -- Singer-songwriter Annie Lennox proudly wears an ""HIV Positive"" black T-shirt, proclaiming her solidarity with the disease's victims, even though her status is HIV negative. ""I constantly want to bring attention to the issue,"" says Lennox. ""This is my way of campaigning visually."" At the TED Global conference last month in Oxford, England, Lennox made clear in a talk and an interview with CNN.com that she is seriously committed to combating the spread of the disease. She was inspired by Nelson Mandela's statement of support in 2003 for the effort to fight the virus by the 46664 Foundation, named after Mandela's number in prison. South Africa was losing 1,000 people a day to AIDS, many of them women and children. Mandela compared the death toll to genocide. ""I'm a woman, and I'm a mother, I told myself that this is something that I have to talk about,"" Lennox said. In her talk at the conference attended by about 700 people, she told the story of a seven-year-old girl in South Africa suffering from the disease and weighing about what a one-year-old child weighs. After the girl was treated and put on a special diet by doctors, she recovered, looking like a child her age. ""The hair on my arms is standing,"" Lennox, said as she showed before and after photos of the girl. ""Isn't it extraordinary?"" An ambassador for U.N. AIDS, she said the organization is committed to ending mother-to-child transmission of HIV by 2015. TED is a nonprofit organization that hosts conferences and makes talks available on its site, http://www.ted.com/. [CNN and TED have a partnership in which TEDTalks are published Tuesdays on CNN.com.] . The Scottish pop music artist gained fame performing with Dave Stewart as the Eurythmics and has gone on to a successful solo career and many music awards. In 2007, Lennox organized a group of 23 female performers to make ""Sing"" as a benefit recording for the fight against HIV/AIDS. It has raised more than 100,000 pounds (about $159,000 U.S. dollars). Lennox was honored with the Services to Humanity Award in 2008 by the British Red Cross. Lennox sees people in developed Western countries living in a bubble of great privilege where they have a responsibility to help those who are not as fortunate. She says she aims to use her skills and influence to help make that happen. Ultimately, Lennox says, the fight against HIV/AIDS is not about charity but about securing human rights.","Annie Lennox: I wear ""HIV Positive"" T-shirt to show my support for fighting the virus .

"(CNN) -- John Travolta and Kelly Preston have returned to Ocala, Florida, with the remains of their teenage son, a family friend told CNN on Tuesday. Actors John Travolta and Kelly Preston say they are ""heartbroken"" over their son's death. They left the Bahamas late Monday night, said Obie Wilchcombe, a member of the Bahamian parliament. An autopsy was conducted Monday in the Bahamas on the body of the couple's son, Jett Travolta. The 16-year-old was found unconscious Friday while on vacation with his family in the Bahamas' West End. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival, local police said. The autopsy results have not been released, but employees of the funeral home that handled the remains said ""seizure"" was listed as the cause of death on the death certificate, celebrity Web site TMZ reported.  Watch the latest reports on Jett Travolta ¬ª . An employee who answered the telephone at the funeral home confirmed the report. The funeral home said ""The body was in great condition and shows no sign of head trauma,"" TMZ reported. TMZ is partly owned by AOL, part of CNN's parent company, Time Warner. The family's doctor observed the autopsy, Wilchcombe told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Monday. The body was cremated, Wilchcombe said Monday. He said Tuesday that a memorial service was planned for Thursday. Funeral plans have not been announced. In a statement posted on the actor's Web site, Travolta and Preston described Jett as ""the most wonderful son that two parents could ever ask for [who] lit up the lives of everyone he encountered."" ""We are heartbroken that our time with him was so brief,"" they said. The couple also has a daughter, Ella, 8. Jett Travolta had a developmental disability that his parents have linked to Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory disorder of the artery walls that most commonly occurs in young children, and that can lead to heart disease. According to the American Heart Association, ""About 80 percent of the people with Kawasaki disease are under age 5. Children over age 8 are rarely affected."" ""They're just a fantastic couple, very family oriented like a lot of people in our community,"" Ocala Mayor Randy Ewers, told Larry King. ""We're very sad about the unfortunate events for one of our community members ... they're part of the community."" Neighbor Jacob Urbowicz described the actor as ""just one of us."" ""He may be famous, but he's just one of us here in the neighborhood. You know, we see the kids, and they see our kids. We're all one family here, you know.

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Calling the federal response to Hurricane Katrina ""a shameful breakdown in government,"" President Barack Obama said Sunday as rebuilding continues, officials are looking ahead to avoid a repeat when future disasters strike. Speaking at Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans to mark the fifth anniversary of Katrina, Obama said construction of a fortified levee system to protect the city is underway and will be finished by next year, ""We should not be playing Russian roulette every hurricane season,"" he said. ""There is no need to dwell on what you experienced and what the world witnessed,"" the president said, speaking to a crowd that included current New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu and members of Louisiana's Congressional delegation. ""We all remember it keenly -- water pouring through broken levees; mothers holding their children above the waterline; people stranded on rooftops begging for help; and bodies lying in the streets of a great American city,"" Obama said. ""It was a natural disaster but also a man-made catastrophe; a shameful breakdown in government that left countless men and women and children abandoned and alone."" But the president spoke of the resilience of city residents. ""Because of all of you -- all the advocates, all the organizers who are here today, folks standing behind me who have worked so hard and never gave up hope, you are all leading the way toward a better future for this city with innovative approaches to fight poverty, improve health care, reduce crime and create opportunities for young people -- because of you, New Orleans is coming back."" The president noted that New Orleans is now one of the nation's fastest-growing cities, and small businesses have surged. ""Five years ago, the Saints had to play every game on the road because of the damage to the Superdome,"" he said. ""Two . weeks ago, we welcomed the Saints to the White House as Super Bowl champions."" ""I don't have to tell you that there are still too many vacant and overgrown lots,"" Obama said. ""There are still too many students attending classes in trailers. There are still too many people unable to find work. And there's still too many New Orleans folks who haven't been able to come home."" ""So while an incredible amount of progress has been made, on this fifth anniversary, I wanted to come here and tell the people of this city directly: My administration is going to stand with you -- and fight alongside you -- until the job is done, until New Orleans is all the way back."" He said his administration has made efforts to reduce red tape and turf wars between agencies, and has put in place a new way to handle disputes, with help from Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana. More than 170 projects are now underway as a result, he said. In addition, federal officials are tackling ""corruption and inefficiency that has long plagued the New Orleans Housing Authority,"" he said. And a group led by Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is examining disaster recovery nationwide. ""We're improving coordination on the ground, modernizing emergency communications and helping families plan for a crisis,"" Obama said. ""And we're putting in place reforms so that never again in America is someone left behind in a disaster because they're living with a disability or because they're elderly or because they're infirm. That will not happen again."" On Friday, he said, his administration announced a final agreement on $1.8 billion for Orleans Parish schools, money the president said had been ""locked up for years, but now it's freed up, so folks here can determine how best to restore the school system."" In addition, the largest civil works project in American history -- the construction of a fortified levee system to protect New Orleans -- is underway and will be finished by next year, he said. ""Together we are helping to make New Orleans a place that stands for what we can do in America -- not just for what we can't do,"" he said. ""And ultimately, that must be the legacy of Katrina: not one of neglect, but of action; not one of indifference, but of empathy; not of abandonment, but of a community working together to meet shared challenges."" Some wounds, the president acknowledged, have not yet healed, and ""there are some losses that can't be repaid. For many who lived through those harrowing days five years ago, there are searing memories that time may not erase. But even amid so much tragedy, we saw the stirrings of a brighter day."" He said he recalled being struck, upon visiting New Orleans four years ago, by the amount of greenery that had returned. ""The work ahead will not be easy,"" he said, ""and there will be setbacks. There will be challenges along the way. But thanks to you, thanks to the great people of this great city, New Orleans is blossoming again."" Following his speech, the president, accompanied by first lady Michelle Obama, were given a short tour of a new neighborhood built on a part of the city that experienced severe flooding when Katrina hit.","Obama: ""New Orleans is coming back""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Thursday his plan to improve America's education system includes charter schools, intense teacher education and parent involvement. ""Now, I know some argue that during a recession, we should focus solely on economic issues ... but education is an economic issue, if not the economic issue, of our time,"" Obama said at the National Urban League's 100th Anniversary Convention in Washington. ""We've tolerated a status quo where America lags behind other nations."" On the issue of higher education, he noted that America used to be first and is now 12th globally when it comes to college graduation rates. Middle-schoolers continue to fall behind in math and science, and the income gap continues to widen between white and African-American students, he said. ""It's essential that we put a college degree that's in reach of everyone (who) wants it,"" he said, adding that the college graduation rate needs to increase by 2020. He also noted that the federal government has increased scholarships and other loan money to achieve that goal, ""so young people don't graduate like Michelle and me with such big loan payments every month,"" he noted to an applauding audience. Obama said his administration wants to reform and strengthen historically black colleges and universities, but ""even if we do all this good stuff for higher education, too many of our children see college as a distant dream because their education went off the rails long before they turned 18,"" he said. He said he is challenging states to offer better early learning options so children can enter kindergarten ready to learn. ""Knowing colors, knowing shapes ... knowing how to sit still. You gotta learn that, especially when you're a boy,"" he said smiling. He acknowledged heavy criticism from civil rights groups about the education reform plans. ""Part (of the criticism) reflects a general resistance to change....the status quo is not working,"" he said. ""We're lifting up quality for all our children... You can't win grants unless you've got a plan to ...deal with schools that have been forgotten."" The Obama education plan champions better teacher pay, but also asks for tangible results. He noted that his sister is a teacher. ""I'm here because of great teachers,"" he said. ""Teachers are the single most important factor in a child's education from moment they step into the classroom. I want higher salaries. I want more support. I want them to be trained like the professionals they  are... with rigorous residencies like doctors go through. ""I don't want talented young people to say, 'I'd love to teach, but I can't afford it.' Instead of a culture where we're always idolizing sports starts and celebrities, I want some teachers on the covers on some of those magazines,"" he said. The president has demanded accountability in his plan. ""As we applaud teachers for their hard work, we need to make sure we're seeing results in the classroom,"" he said. ""Let's work with teachers to become more effective."" If that doesn't work, Obama said officials need to find the right teacher for that classroom. ""Our goal isn't to fire or to admonish teachers, it's to provide accountability."" Obama noted that the administration's Race to the Top program has sparked 32 states to reform their education laws ""before we even spent a dime,"" he said. ""In each round we've leveraged change across the country ... sown the seeds of achievement."" He said the program is different from the No Child Left Behind reform that he said caused states to lower standards. ""They are now raising those standards back up partly because of Race to the Top,"" he noted. Obama said sometimes a school's problems are so deep, they need a complete overhaul. He said he's challenging states to turn around 5,000 of the lowest-performing schools, and $4 billion has been earmarked for those schools. ""It's not about labeling a troubled school as a failure, it's about investing in that school's future."" ""In some cases that means restarting the school under different management as a charter school,"" he said. ""Some people don't like charter schools ... but I want to give states and school districts the chance to try new things. If charter schools doesn't work, we'll hold it accountable and shut it down."" Obama called Race to the Top ""the single most ambitious, meaningful reform effort we've attempted in this country in generations. We won't see results overnight. ... It may take a decade for these changes to pay off."" The last ingredient to Obama's education reform effort is parent involvement. But the president said children should take responsibility for their education, too. ""Parents are going to have to get more involved in their children's education,"" he said. ""Our kids need to understand nobody's gonna hand them a future. Education isn't something you just tip your head and they pour it in your ear. You've got to want it."" Obama acknowledged that some families are dealing with unemployment, substance abuse and violence. ""I know the character of America's young people. I saw them volunteer on my campaign ... ask questions in town hall meetings and ... write me letters."" Race to the Top is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to reward states for aggressively reforming their education systems. The $4.35 billion is being awarded in two phases. Tennessee and Delaware were the only two states to receive funds in the first round of the competition.  Eighteen states and the District of Columbia were selected as finalists this week to receive more than $3 billion in the second round of funding for the program. The second-round finalists will travel to Washington in early August to present their plans to the reviewers who scored their applications, according to the Education Department. The winners will be announced in September. Not all of the finalists, however, will be awarded grants from the nearly $3.4 billion remaining in program, Education Secretary Arne Duncan said, adding that Obama has requested $1.35 billion for the program in the administration's fiscal 2011 budget. Tennessee received nearly $501 million, allowing the state and all 136 school districts to move forward in implementing comprehensive school reform plans over the next four years. Delaware has received about $100 million. The two states earned high marks for the commitment to reform from elected officials, teacher's union leaders and business leaders. Federal education officials said Delaware and Tennessee also have aggressive plans to improve teacher and principal evaluation and turn around their lowest-performing schools. In addition, both states have put in place strong laws and policies to support their reform efforts.","NEW: Obama says charter schools, teacher education and parent involvement are key .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- When Yo-Yo Ma enters a room, everything changes. Yo-Yo Ma's new album, ""Songs of Joy and Peace,"" is his first holiday-themed record. His energy and warmth (he hugs everyone in sight) and curiosity (for every question you ask him, he asks two of you) envelop you like a blanket. He's also surprisingly funny. The world's most celebrated cellist introduces himself not as Yo-Yo, or Mr. Ma, or even Yo Mama (as you might expect from a wisenheimer). Instead, with a hint of mischief and a nod to the everyman celebrity of campaign '08, he offers, ""I'm Joe the cellist."" He adds, ""I get the 'plumb' jobs."" He might be right. Consider Ma's latest album, ""Songs of Joy and Peace"" (Sony), the first holiday-themed release of his career. Ma describes it as a musical party, a collection of good-time collaborations with musical buddies, James Taylor and Diana Krall among them.  Watch Yo-Yo Ma enjoy time with his friends ¬ª . ""I asked everybody to bring their favorite piece of music that signified joy to them,"" Ma said. ""And out came all of these fantastic pieces. Many of them I didn't know."" Krall applies her mellow voice and piano playing to the lighthearted ""You Couldn't be Cuter."" Ma joined Taylor in Taylor's Washington, Massachusetts, barn to record George Harrison's ""Here Comes the Sun."" Other guests include vocalists Alison Krauss and Renee Fleming, trumpeter Chris Botti and saxophonist Joshua Redman. Ma also enlists help from friends who are less mainstream such as the green-haired Galician bagpiper Cristina Pato and mandolin player Chris Thiele. Jake Shimabukuro's ukulele provides a delightfully plucky counterpoint to Ma's soaring cello on the John Lennon/Yoko Ono hit ""Happy Xmas (War is Over)."" Born in Paris to Chinese parents and raised in New York, Ma, 53, is no stranger to thinking outside the music box. In 1998 he founded the Silk Road Project, a multi-cultural exchange designed to help artists and musicians share ideas across borders. His international efforts have earned him the title of United Nations Messenger of Peace. And to Ma, his extensive travels have earned him comparison to a certain shifty-footed children's book character. ""As a musician I'm kind of nomadic, Waldo-like,"" he says. ""I show up in different places, and I'm witness to unbelievable things."" CNN caught up with Ma at Legacy Studios in New York where some of the recording took place for ""Songs of Joy and Peace."" The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: One of the things that's apparent from watching the footage of the studio sessions from this album is that everyone is so humbled to work with you, and you are just as humbled to work with them. Yo-Yo Ma: Well, I think what I loved about the sessions was that there was mutuality, if that's a word, of just being open and wanting to do the best thing possible. And so I think everybody just came with an open heart and open mind. ... The amount of talent that walked through the room was staggering for me. Day after day I thought I could die and go to heaven. ... Every day was like that. So I feel very, very, very lucky and very grateful to my friends. CNN: With the work you do, particularly with the Silk Road Project, you've really had to relax the rules of classical music. Has that been difficult? Ma: There's a part of me that's always charging ahead. I'm the curious kid, always going to the edge. But I have such deep love for the domain that I come from, whether you call it classical music or ... I don't know what you call it these days because it's no longer really definable. It's coming from a lot of places. Yes, you're right, I had to relax. It was scary. And I think the idea of transcending fear and transcending technique or understanding different frames is part of the adventure. Something's scary until you make it familiar and comfortable. I feel so much more a member of the planet community after doing this work for 10 years, because I feel like you can drop me most places and I'll be OK. I'll find out what's going on and find a way to participate. CNN: You're a big believer in the idea that music is this big unifying force in the world. What other common languages have you come across? Ma: Oh my goodness. I think there are so many basic ways of behaving that we all have. Guest-host relations ... there's no culture that doesn't have that. And there's almost no culture where there are not stories where people take in strangers. Gift giving is another act that is universal. Certainly caring for one's group, a tribal mentality. Sometimes it means putting up firewalls because it's dangerous to mingle. But in today's world it seems like we have different groupings. [We seem to have] a younger generation that actually is much more tribe-blind or they've created their own social communities. So it's interesting to live in today's world and observe how within urban or rural areas people's habits may be changing. And I think culturally speaking I'm trying to work in such a way that we can actually find more commonality than the differences, especially because often things happen so quickly. CNN: Can you ever remember a moment in your life when you felt bored? Ma: Yes. I hated that feeling so much. I think we all remember when we were much younger, how slowly time [goes]. And I think those years often were very boring years. When is summer going to come? When is Christmas going to come? Never! But I think I decided or thought about how I really would love to have an interesting life. I really would like to be involved in things and to understand things, and in some ways you've got to be careful what you wish for because I feel very, very blessed to have such an interesting life and to be able to have little snapshots of lives of people from many different parts of the world. CNN: What do you do to relax? Ma: Because so much of what I do involves people, being in a place with more trees than people immediately takes me down. I live in Cambridge [Massachusetts] and so when we go to western Massachusetts and see the mountains and trees, suddenly I'm totally relaxed and feel fabulous.","Yo-Yo Ma's new album is first holiday record for cellist .

"(Silicon Alley Insider) -- Newspaper companies are a dying breed, and one consistent scapegoat for their demise is the rise of blogs and online news sites. In October 2009, Tom Curly, CEO of the Associated Press news service, said blogs were directing large amounts of revenue away from original content creators. At the same time, Rupert Murdoch sneered at bloggers, saying they would cause the ""content creators"" like his company News Corp., parent of the Wall Street Journal and New York Post, ""to pay the ultimate price"" if they were not held in check. Blogs and other new media from Facebook to Twitter have made newspapers less relevant. If you want quicker, more focused news, blogs are a great resource. If you want more local, hyperpersonal news -- i.e., what your sister's cat did today -- then Facebook or Twitter are your best bets. But despite factors of expediency and personalization, new media outlets are not to blame for the creeping death of newspapers. It makes for a great story to have upstart blogs destroying hidebound news organizations, but the truth is much more simple. Advertisers are killing newspapers. Advertisers have fled newspapers for the greener, cheaper pastures of the internet and they're not coming back. On the internet, an advertiser has a greater ability to target his or her ad spend. Want to advertise to just teenage boys interested in football? Can't do that with the newspaper. Want to advertise to women from Yale? Can't do that in a newspaper. The numbers prove this out. Alan Mutter, an expert on the economics of the newspaper industry, recently reported that newspaper advertising was down about 10 percent year-over-year for the first quarter of the year. Meanwhile, advertising on the internet, radio and television were all up. Web advertising was up 7.5 percent. Newspapers still attract more ad dollars than the web, but that is expected to change soon. PricewaterhouseCoopers' annual report on media trends reported that web advertising totaled $24.2 billion last year. The Newspaper Association of America reported $24.82 billion in advertising for 2009. By the end of this year, the web may be in front. The expansion of advertising on the web is both good news and bad news for newspapers. Newspapers like The New York Times have taken advantage of the web to create amazing products like interactive graphics and videos. This has helped propel their overall readership to new heights. Millions of people visit The New York Times' website daily. That's important to keep in mind when anyone thinks of blaming blogs for the death of newspapers. There's enough people on the web to go around. Newspapers and blogs are expanding their audiences simultaneously. As newspapers take advantage of the medium to tell stories, they'll see some of that $24 billion in online ad dollars. Unfortunately, it won't be enough to support what they do now -- and most of the money is going to the likes of Google. The New York Times online edition only generates a fraction of the revenue of the print publication. The Times is a lot less relevant as a place to advertise online than it was offline. And no, blogs are not siphoning many dollars off The New York Times online franchise. The Huffington Post is the most successful blog in the world, with some 12 million unique visitors a month. That traffic bests traditional news organizations like the Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal by a couple of million. Yet, for all its success, revenue remains relatively elusive. HuffPo only generated $15 million last year. It hopes to double that this year to $30 million, but that's still tiny. For some perspective, The New York Times' online revenue is an estimated $150 million to $175 million annually. If advertisers aren't spending heavily on blogs or traditional news organizations, where are they spending? Google. The search giant has annual revenue of more than $20 billion, with the vast majority of that from web advertising. The funny thing about Google is that it has tried to master almost every sort of business. It's investing in windmills, it's investing in mobile phones, it wants to lay cable for high speed internet connections, just to name a few. Yet, for all the businesses it has tried, there's one it says it has no interest in: print content like newspapers. The reason? Making money on newspapers, and getting advertisers interested in spending again on print publications, has even the big brains at Google stumped. Google CEO Eric Schmidt recently told newspaper editors, ""We have a business model problem. We don't have a news problem."" We don't have a news problem, because there's enough news under the sun for newspapers and blogs to cover it all. Now, if there were only enough ad dollars.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- None of the seven doctors and one nurse investigated by California authorities will face criminal prosecution in the death of singer Michael Jackson, the state attorney general's office said Wednesday. Investigators did not find sufficient evidence to recommend criminal prosecution of any of the medical practitioners, said Christine Gasparac, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Jerry Brown. But a doctor who prescribed drugs to the pop singer using a fake name shortly before the singer's death could be disciplined by the California medical board, Gasparac said. She would not identify the doctor referred to the medical board or the others who were cleared. Dr. Conrad Murray, who was Jackson's personal physician when he died a year ago, was not part of the probe, Gasparac said. Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter earlier this year in the entertainer's death. State drug agents executed search warrants at several doctors' offices last summer and at least one pharmacy. ""After reviewing hundreds of pages of records and documents obtained from the medical practitioners, the attorney general's office has referred one doctor, who wrote prescriptions to an alias known to have been used by Jackson, to the California medical board for further review,"" Gasparac said. Agents spent several hours inside the Mickey Fine Pharmacy just below the Beverly Hills practice of Dr. Arnold Klein, Jackson's dermatologist. Investigators also visited Klein's office, where Jackson was seen several times in the weeks before his June 25, 2009, death. Klein told CNN last year that he never prescribed dangerous drugs to the singer. Searches of Jackson's rented mansion revealed a long list of prescription drugs in his bedroom after his death, according to court documents and the autopsy report. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Jackson's death was from an overdose of propofol, a powerful anesthesia used to put surgical patients to sleep. A consultant's report included in the autopsy said the level of lorazepam, a powerful anti-anxiety agent found in Jackson's body ""would have accentuated the respiratory and cardiovascular depression from propofol."" CNN's Carey Bodenheimer contributed to this report.","LAPD asks state drug agents to probe seven Jackson doctors, one nurse .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Forecast to gain ""major"" Category 3 status, outer rainbands association with a strengthening Hurricane Earl were affecting the islands of Antigua and Barbuda on Sunday, with conditions forecast to deteriorate, the National Hurricane Center said. Earl became a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday. As of 8 p.m. ET, its center was about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Barbuda and about 185 miles (300 kilometers) east of St. Martin. Its maximum sustained winds had increased slightly to 85 mph (140 kph) and higher gusts, and the storm was heading west-northwest at near 14 mph (22 kph). The center of Earl is forecast to pass near or over the northern Leeward Islands Sunday night and Monday, the center said. A hurricane warning was in effect for Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, St. Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla, St. Martin, St. Barthelemy, Saba and St. Eustatius. As of 5 p.m., the government of Antigua and Barbuda also had added the British Virgin Islands to the warning, forecasters said. A hurricane watch and a tropical storm warning was in effect for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, including the islands of Culebra and Vieques. Tropical storm-force conditions were forecast in the warning area Sunday afternoon and evening, with hurricane conditions expected early Monday, forecasters said. Tropical storm conditions were expected to spread across the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Monday, with hurricane conditions possible on Monday night. ""Strengthening is expected during the next 48 hours, and Earl is forecast to become a major hurricane by Tuesday,"" forecasters said. Earl was forecast to turn west-northwest and slow down over the next day. Tracking maps show it moving northward away from the Caribbean and possibly affecting the U.S. East Coast by Friday. Easterners should pay attention to Earl, as it could affect areas anywhere from the Carolinas to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, over Labor Day weekend, said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. It is too soon to tell whether the storm could make landfall, she said. However, outer bands of the storm are likely to hit North Carolina beginning Thursday, kicking up large swells and possibly generating rip currents through Labor Day weekend, Jeras said. Earl is expected to dump between 3 and 5 inches of rain over the northern Leeward Islands, with isolated amounts of 8 inches possible in some areas. Puerto Rico is expected to receive between 4 and 6 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of 12 inches possible over higher elevations. In addition, Earl is expected to produce a 2-to-4-foot storm surge within the hurricane warning area, and 1-to-3-foot storm surge in coastal areas, accompanied by high surf. Meanwhile, Hurricane Danielle remained away from land, and was gradually weakening as it moved northeastward, the hurricane center said. The center of the storm was about 605 miles (975 kilometers) south of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Once a Category 4 storm, Danielle had weakened Sunday to a Category 1 hurricane with winds of near 80 mph (130 kph). It was expected to continue to weaken, and was moving north-northeast at near 29 mph (46 kph). Large waves and dangerous surf conditions should diminish near Bermuda on Sunday, the hurricane center said, and ""swells from Danielle are expected to gradually subside during the next day or two along portions of the United States East Coast."" A number of people were rescued along the East Coast because of those swells and riptide currents. Nearly 250 were rescued Saturday in the waters off Ocean City, Maryland, authorities said. In addition, an area eastward from Earl could develop into a tropical depression and then potentially into Tropical Storm Fiona, Jeras said.","Too soon to tell whether Earl could dampen U.S. Labor Day .

"(CNN) -- Watching the Toyota recall crisis unfold over the past few months has been like watching a wildfire on a windy day. Just when it would appear that the flames might be contained, another powerful gust sweeps through, stirring them up and blowing them still higher. True, Toyota has acted as its own arsonist at times. If it had attacked the floor-mat entrapment problem as aggressively in 2007 as it is doing now, then perhaps the current crisis could have been avoided. And if the company had been acting as a better switchboard operator between Europe and North America, it could have more quickly connected the sticking accelerator problems in some European cars with the fact that the same pedal assembly was used in eight U.S. models. And it might possibly have avoided the recent stop-sale on those models. But some of the gusts have been whipped up by the news media. The software glitch in the antilock braking system of the 2010 Toyota Prius and Lexus HS 250h, which causes a momentary loss of braking capability, is serious enough that it should be fixed. But on an overall scale of recalled problems, it's relatively minor. Yet, it continues to grab headlines in this Toyota-sensitized environment. Vehicles are recalled all the time by just about every automaker. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued 1,399 safety-related recalls affecting more than 38 million vehicles from 2007 to 2009. And while Toyota's inferno has been grabbing the nation's attention, new recalls have been springing up. Chrysler, GM, Honda and Mazda have all issued recalls in recent weeks, for problems ranging from faulty power steering to defective air bags. And Hyundai issued its own stop-sale on the 2011 Sonata because of a faulty front-door latch. Yes, the idea of a runaway vehicle is a frightful thought to drivers. And we encourage the government to continue to investigate complaints of unintended acceleration. But consumers shouldn't lose sight of two important points. Such incidents are rare; the approximately 2,000 consumer complaints received by the NHTSA that were related to unintended acceleration in Toyotas over the past 10 years works out to about one in every 10,000 Toyotas sold over that period. Also, these complaints aren't confined to Toyota. In an analysis of 5,916 total complaints filed to the NHTSA database for 2008 models (as of August 28, 2009, before the problem hit the national spotlight), we found 166 related to unintended acceleration. While ones citing Toyota-built vehicles made up the highest percentage -- 41 percent -- there were also complaints related to 20 other brands. Ford vehicles drew the second-highest number at 28 percent. Still, while there has been unusually strong reaction to Toyota's problems, such flare-ups can lead to positive changes. Following the Firestone tires/Ford Explorer recalls in 2000, the government enacted the TREAD (Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation) Act.  Among other things, it mandated tire-pressure monitoring systems in passenger cars and created the Early Warning Reporting database, which requires manufacturers to report problem data to the NHTSA. We're hoping that the energy surrounding this crisis can be harnessed to improve our auto-safety system so that such rare-but-deadly problems can be caught earlier or prevented altogether. To that end, Consumer Reports is recommending that the government take the following actions: . -- Improve public access to safety information by making their complaint databases more uniform, user-friendly and easier to search. This would help investigators spot a problem trend more easily and perhaps address it before it becomes a crisis. -- Mandate that cars be required to stop in a reasonable distance, even with the throttle fully open. One solution to this is ""smart throttle"" technology, which disengages the throttle if the brake pedal is depressed. It's being used now by some automakers and Toyota says such a system will be installed in all of its models by the end of this year. -- Improve the recall compliance process. According to NHTSA, the average consumer response rate to vehicle recalls is only about 74 percent, meaning that a quarter of all affected vehicles never get the fix. This puts used-car buyers at unnecessary risk. -- Give regulators more funding. In 2007, auto crashes made up 99 percent of all transportation-related deaths and injuries. Yet, NHTSA's budget is just over 1 percent of the overall budget of its parent, the Department of Transportation. That's not enough for the reality of auto safety today. Despite the tragedies, the Toyota crisis can yet be a catalyst for positive change that can benefit consumers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rik Paul.","Rik Paul: Some facts have been overlooked in the rush of coverage of Toyota .
He says some auto defects and recalls are routine and relatively minor .
Paul says other manufacturers also are subjects of unintended acceleration complaints .
Good can come out of this if regulators are given more funding, he says ."
"(CNN) -- A Colorado convict serving time for attempted murder was recaptured Wednesday after breaking out of prison over the weekend, and a female hostage with him was released unharmed, prison officials said. Douglas Alward was caught near Yuma, Colorado, about 145 miles east of Denver and about 50 miles south of the Sterling Correctional Facility he broke out of Sunday, prison spokeswoman Katherine Sanguinetti told HLN's ""Prime News."" Alward, 48, was serving a 20- to 40-year term for attempted murder, assault and kidnapping and had broken out of prison three times before, Sanguinetti said. He was up for parole in October, according to prison records. Investigators found him in a trailer near Yuma about noon Wednesday. He surrendered once confronted, releasing the woman with him without injury, said Ari Zavaras, executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections. Zavaras said searchers tracked Alward to a 4-square-mile patch of cornfields outside Yuma on Wednesday morning. ""He didn't offer any resistance, let alone armed resistance,"" Zavaras said. Zavaras released few details of the escape, but said an investigation into how Alward broke out of the maximum-security facility was under way. He promised a ""top to bottom"" review was in the works. He said Alward ""breached"" the fence around the facility somehow, and some tools used in the breakout were found nearby. The fence was not cut, he said. Prison officials are looking at how Alward obtained the tools, but don't believe he had outside help, Zavaras said. Kevin Milyard, the prison's warden, said a guard noticed something wrong within an hour of the breakout, and an emergency head count quickly confirmed Alward was missing. Alward is facing a likely charge of escape and other charges that remain to be determined, Zavaras said.","Douglas Alward broke out of an eastern Colorado prison Sunday .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Five years after Hurricane Katrina struck, Conrad Wyre III is disappointed and disillusioned with the lack of progress made in New Orleans. ""Nothing's really changed,"" said the 35-year-old New Orleans native. He says some spots are still ""in shambles"" in 2010, and that many residents still feeling helpless and without support, like they're ""floating in the wind."" Wyre, known as ""Sam"" by his close friends and family, fled to Katy, Texas, with his then-pregnant wife shortly before the storm hit. But, he wasn't able to ride out the storm in peace for long. After Katrina hit, he received a frantic, barely audible phone call from his mother. She and Wyre's father had stayed put despite warnings. The floodwaters were rising and they were in dire need of help, and fast. Attempts to get assistance for his parents were futile. The Navy, the Coast Guard and the New Orleans Police Department were among the officials who told Wyre they couldn't reach the area where his mother and father were trapped. Shocked and upset with the those responses, Wyre knows there was no question about his next move. He immediately went back to save his parents from the flooding caused by the failed levees. ""People were down here suffering,"" Wyre said. ""Somebody dropped the ball. ... since the storm, I have lost faith in all levels of government."" The insurance companies haven't been helpful, either, Wyre said. His deductible is $7,500, which he wouldn't be able to afford should another such weather-based tragedy occur. Wyre made the eight-hour trek back to the ravaged city. About a mile from his parents' house, tents were set up and people had gathered there. Wyre paid a man with a boat $50 to take him to his parents' neighborhood, where he blew an air horn and looked for survivors. Wyre -- who didn't know how to swim -- found his parents, who were then taken to safety along with their neighbors. Wyre's parents were among the few people in their neighborhood who rebuilt their house, despite the damage done by Katrina. However, in a cruel twist of fate, a 2007 tornado destroyed their home again. Not wanting to fall victim to a weather disaster for a third time, they moved to a different neighborhood, but still close, and certainly within the state of Louisiana. Seeing his beloved city in ruins post-Katrina was devastating for Wyre. Eighty percent of the city was underwater. Streets once exploding with life -- loud music and laughing -- were drowned. There were many bleak moments. There were times when it seemed there was no hope. He says the crime, carjackings and political corruption the area experienced afterward hindered attempts for a much-needed renaissance. Some spots, such as Jefferson Parish, rebounded quickly, thanks in large part to the tourism sector. New Orleans has 300 more restaurants than it did before Katrina hit. Other areas have yet to make even a partial recovery, especially the Lower 9th Ward. Wyre says that was one place that lacked basic necessities, like grocery stores that operated for an extended period of time. In the days following Katrina, people stood in line for hours to get into the nearest Wal-Mart, where the shelves were quickly emptied. Animals were left to die in abandoned houses. For many, a deep depression sunk in. For some, it has yet to fade. ""There was nothing to come back to --nowhere to go -- it was horrible,"" says Wyre, who made a self-described ""emotional"" return visit to the  neighborhood of Hollygrove, where he grew up, and where he documented the devastation with before-and-after pictures for CNN.com's ""Then and Now"" project. In some instances, the changes seen in these pictures over a five-year span are minimal. Seeing areas that haven't been fixed since 2005 is tough for Wyre to accept. iReport: Wyre revisits Hollygrove . Many homes are still abandoned and boarded up. Old water marks, some reaching halfway up buildings, are still visible, as are spray-painted marks that indicated bodies, odor or pets inside. Overgrown yards and the obvious blight make it tough to forget all the damage. ""Everybody was poor after the storm,"" Wyre said. He says the still-rough conditions are why many evacuees have never returned to their neighborhoods. Many moved out of state to places like Atlanta, Georgia; Denver, Colorado; Houston, Texas. It's tough for Wyre to walk down the familiar, once-vital streets now deserted. ""There's whole blocks with no cars, no one out and about ... nothing. It's boarded up, that's the aftermath of Katrina. Just have to deal with it."" But almost immediately after Katrina, Wyre and his family were itching to get back to the New Orleans they love. They weren't thrilled with their temporary time in Texas, saying there was a lack of action and excitement in the air. There were none of the parades, explosive brass band shows or nights spent drinking and laughing with friends regaling stories after a full day at work. It didn't take long for the Wyre family to pack up their belongings and get back to the city streets they knew and loved. Despite the past, and the lack of improvements in some sections of New Orleans, Wyre is still thinking optimistically, and keeping his fingers crossed. He's hoping brighter days are in the city's future, and is more than ready for the day when people in New Orleans are no longer treading water, but are able to swim deeply in Big Easy's legendary greatness. ""I love the city, the culture. ... That's all I know. I can't survive anywhere else.""","Photographer Conrad Wyre III left New Orleans shortly before Katrina struck .

"(CNN)  -- The patient, in his late 70s, had survived prostate cancer and had a new diagnosis of leukemia. A few days before, he'd been healthy and fine, but now his white blood cell count was so high that it was clogging his circulatory system, making it hard for him to breathe. We brought his white count down and relieved his shortness of breath. At that point, he could have opted for palliative care and gone home on hospice with a decent enough quality of life to enjoy what little time he had left. However, the patient, encouraged by his family and urged on by his oncologist, chose aggressive treatment instead. This is a hard case. In his recent New Yorker article ""Letting Go,"" Dr. Atul Gawande explains how the first impulse of doctors, patients and family members to ""fight"" cancer or other serious illnesses makes it very difficult to have honest discussions of what treatment can and cannot do. I understand why physicians find these conversations difficult, why it's preferable to focus on the good we can possibly accomplish rather than the likely futility of the struggle. But there's another story to be told in these cases, and it's usually the nurse who's the observer of that narrative: the suffering caused by these well-intentioned treatments. Chemo was risky for this patient because of his age and medical history, and the damage done was unbelievably bad. The problems began when cells killed by the chemotherapy spilled their contents, overloading my patient's kidneys and throwing him into renal failure. The intravenous fluids he'd needed had been too much for his circulatory system, and he developed heart failure, too. One morning, I came in with his pills, and he said, ""You're doing too much. I can't take it."" The next week, he was on dialysis, but it wasn't working, and his entire lower body was hugely swollen with fluid. That day, he accosted me with, ""What the hell are you doing to me?"" Both times, I told the medical team what he'd said and asked whether it was ethical to continue chemotherapy. Several members of the team shared my concerns, and as a group, we talked the situation over with the attending doctor. Our view was that the treatments were eroding the patient's quality of life with little promise of good in return. The attending physician, whom I know to be conscientious and caring, disagreed, as did the patient's family. When the doctor prodded the patient, saying, ""You want to keep going, right? Right?"" the patient himself concurred, ""Yes, let's keep going."" So the chemo finished. Then, blood began to appear in the patient's urine. His bladder was brittle because of the radiation treatments he'd had for prostate cancer, and because of the chemo, he had too few platelets. Without enough platelets, that fragile tissue would not stop bleeding, but it also formed blood clots in his bladder that caused excruciating pain. Watching this patient suffer, not from his disease but because of what we did to him in the name of helping him, was agonizing. He'd wanted to ""keep going,"" to ""keep on fighting,"" but what did he really mean? Always when I hear these phrases applied to oncology patients, I think of Peter Weir's 1981 film ""Gallipoli."" The film portrays two Australian sprinters, Archy and Frank, who enlist together during World War I and end up fighting the Turkish army at the Battle of Gallipoli. A lot of soldiers died during the Gallipoli campaign, and the end of the film dramatizes a real battle in which four brigades of Australian soldiers were sent out of the trenches to certain death. Frank is chosen to be a runner, a deliverer of messages during the battle, and he gets an order to call off the assault once it's clear that it's not a fight but a massacre. However, Frank can't run quickly enough to get the hold order to Archy's trench in time, and the signal to attack is given. Archy comes up out of the trench running as fast as he can, alone, chest forward, until the Turkish machine guns mow him down. The wasteful sacrifices of war and the pointlessness of my patient's suffering share some obvious parallels here, but there's a deeper lesson as well. Archy and Frank were soldiers; my patient was not. They made a choice when they enlisted, but my patient was never given his real choice, between aggressive treatment that might do more harm than good and getting just enough treatment to keep him stable and allow him to go home to be with the people he loved. The very real benefits of such a focus on palliative care were documented in the August 19 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer who received palliative care in addition to chemotherapy claimed an improved quality of life and lived more than 2¬Ω months longer than than those who had no such care. My patient's decision to ""keep fighting"" seemed to be based on a misperception of what medicine could accomplish and of what the personal costs of our treatments would be. Indeed, a month after being admitted, swollen, breathless, bleeding and in pain, with his leukemia as robust as ever, he went on hospice in the hospital and died. In ""Letting Go,"" Gawande says we don't want Gen. George Custer as a model in medicine but more Robert E. Lee.

"(CNN) -- A California woman missing for nearly a year and believed to be dead may still be alive and living in the Las Vegas, Nevada, area, detectives from Los Angeles said Thursday. Investigators have spent about six weeks checking out a high-school classmate's report that he saw Mitrice Richardson at a hotel casino, and are ""unable to show that it is not a good lead,"" Los Angeles police Capt. Kevin McClure said. And detectives have talked to several witnesses since then who believe seen her in the area, he said. ""It is not a verified sighting of her here, but we feel good enough to come up here and spend a good deal of time to get the information out to the community that we believe she might be here,"" McClure told reporters at a news conference in Las Vegas. But Richardson's mother, who is suing the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department over her daughter's disappearance, cast doubt on the report. Latice Sutton told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" that the man who reported the sighting hasn't seen her daughter for a decade. Richardson, who would be 25 now, is a former beauty pageant contestant who was last seen leaving a Los Angeles County sheriff's station in Malibu in the early morning hours of September 17, 2009. She had been arrested the previous evening at an upscale restaurant for allegedly not paying for her meal, and patrons at the restaurant said Mitrice exhibited strange behavior. Her family has said the college honors graduate suffered from mental health issues and should have been kept at the sheriff's station until a relative arrived to pick her up. Investigators are now asking the public in and around Las Vegas to report any possible sightings, and urged Richardson herself to come forward. ""She's not in any type of trouble,"" said Capt. Dave Smith, of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. ""She's not subject to any type of arrest We would like her to approach her family, approach us, and please let us know that she's OK."" A high-school classmate now living in Las Vegas reported seeing Richardson at the Rio Hotel and Casino in early June, sparking the new effort by detectives to check out his report. ""He walked up and said, 'Hi, Matrice,"" Smith said. ""She basically looked at him with kind of a shocked look and left the location."" The casino's security cameras didn't have video of the incident that was of a high enough quality. But since then, investigators have talked to more than 70 people who say they have seen her, said William McSweeney, chief of the Los Angeles County detective division. Those accounts were ""based on a photograph and some passage of time, in most instances,"" McSweeney said. ""But that volume causes us to beleive we're on the right track."" But Sutton told HLN on Thursday, ""I do not believe it was her."" She said hundreds of similar reports in Los Angeles have failed to pan out, while the man who reported seeing her in the casino hadn't seen her daughter since high school. And she questioned why police considered that report believable after dismissing an earlier report by Michael Richardson, the missing woman's father, that he had spotted his daughter in Las Vegas. ""Someone who hasn't seen Mitrice in 10 years, they consider him now more credible than the biological father? Sutton asked. ""I do not believe this is Mitrice. Mitrice was last seen at the sheriff's department."" Last month, Sutton sued Los Angeles County and several sheriff's officials for wrongful death and negligence in her daughter's disappearance, according to court documents. Sutton argued that the sheriff's department failure to administer psychiatric or medical evaluations and the fact that Richardson was released ""alone in an unfamiliar area without money, a cellular phone or means of transportation amounts to negligence."" The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages. Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the sheriff's department, told CNN in September that the decision to release Richardson was made because ""she was not intoxicated, she didn't exhibit any mental issues, so when we were done running her fingerprints and criminal history, then we are obligated by law to release her from custody."" He also has said that a female jailer ""offered to her to stay the night. She could have stayed, but she wanted to leave."" Police have not discounted the possibility that Richardson may not want to be found, but her family believes that would be ""out of her character"" McClure said. ""We could find that out, but we'll never know that until we actually talk to Mitrice,"" he said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Two officers in the troubled New Orleans Police Department have been indicted in connection with the beating death of a civilian in 2005, according to the U.S. Justice Department. The federal indictment alleges that Officer Melvin Williams kicked the victim and struck him with a baton, fracturing his ribs and rupturing his spleen. The victim, Raymond Robair, was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. Williams and Officer Matthew Moore were also charged with obstructing justice when they submitted a false incident report and failed to tell hospital personnel Williams had beaten Robair, according to the indictment in the Eastern District of Louisiana. Details of the indictment were released by the U.S. Justice Department in Washington. Moore also allegedly lied about the incident in an FBI investigation in March of this year according to the indictment. Moore is accused of telling federal agents Williams had not kicked or beaten Robair. Robair's death occurred in July 2005, two months before the city was slammed by Hurricane Katrina. The indictment of the two officers comes only weeks after five current and former members of the police department were indicted in connection with two deaths at the Danziger Bridge in New Orleans in the immediate aftermath of Katrina. All of the charges come as the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division continues a separate broad investigation into the ""patterns or practices"" of alleged misconduct within the New Orleans police department. On May 17, Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez told New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu that the Justice Department will investigate ""allegations of excessive force, unconstitutional searches and seizures, racial profiling, failures to provide adequate police services to particular neighborhoods and related misconduct."" On July 13, in a visit to New Orleans to announce the Danziger Bridge indictments, Attorney General Eric Holder vowed the Justice Department ""will not tolerate wrongdoing by those who have sworn to protect the public."" ""Making sure that this city's police department is the best that it can be is our sacred obligation,"" Holder told a crowd in the city.","Two News Orleans officers face federal charges in a 2005 beating death .

"Washington (CNN) -- Civil rights leaders marking the 47th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech Saturday scorned a nearby Glenn Beck-led rally, saying it came with no message and with a presumption that King's famous discourse can be used as a conservative platform. The Rev. Al Sharpton and a range of activists spoke at the event, which they called ""Reclaim the Dream,"" insisting that King's vision for America has not been completely fulfilled. ""Don't let anyone tell you that they have the right to take their country back. It's our country, too,"" said Avis Jones Deweaver, executive director of the National Council of Negro Women, making a reference to the Tea Party members attending the Beck rally at the Lincoln Memorial. ""We will reclaim the dream. It was ours from the beginning. A dream that we will make reality,"" she said at the Dunbar High School rally in northwest Washington, D.C. People at Dunbar stood shoulder to shoulder, filling half of a high school football field and the track around one half of the field. They also filled about five sections of the bleachers. Many of the speakers made numerous references to what America was like in 1963, when King gave his speech. ""Schools all over America still were segregated and public accommodations housing was segregated and blacks in the South didn't have the right to vote. The march on Washington changed all of that. Glenn Beck's march will change nothing. But you can't blame Glenn Beck for his 'March on Washington' envy. Too bad he doesn't have a message to match the place or that is worthy of the march,"" said Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-District of Columbia. Following the rally, Sharpton linked arms with fellow marchers and walked three miles to the site of the future Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial, just a few blocks from the Lincoln Memorial. Sharpton and others couldn't resist discussing Beck's controversial rally on the National Mall. Beck, who has a program on Fox News as well as several radio programs, was criticized for holding his event -- which he called ""Restoring Honor"" -- where King delivered his speech August 28, 1963. Civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson told CNN that Beck was mimicking King and ""humiliating the tradition."" Beck said the site of his rally was appropriate to reflect on the legacy of King, ""the man who stood down on those stairs and gave his life for everyone's right to have a dream."" ""They may have the Mall,"" countered Sharpton, ""but we have the message. They may have the platform but we have the dream."" ""This is our day and we ain't giving it away,"" said Sharpton, who reminded the crowd that much civil rights progress has been seen in the last several decades but more needs to be made. Sharpton told CNN's Don Lemon on Saturday night that Beck's rally wasn't appropriate for a day when people reflect on King's policy message. ""Whose civil rights agenda did he lay out? It was a motivational speech,"" Sharpton said of Beck. ""It might be good, but it's not civil rights."" Earlier Saturday, Sharpton noted that in 1963, African-Americans had to sit in the back of buses and couldn't check into segregated hotels. Now, he said, people flew in to the event first class and can use public accommodations. And most significantly, he noted, the president of the United States is an African-American. Sharpton also said that more progress needs to be made in education, criminal justice and other issues, such as statehood for the District of Columbia, which has a large black population. ""We're not there yet,"" he said. Education Secretary Arne Duncan, who also spoke at the event, called education ""the civil rights issue of our generation."" He said it's time to stop being complacent about education and demand excellence. Sharpton said the conservatives who rallied at the Lincoln Memorial should ask President Abraham Lincoln himself why he led the fight against states' rights during the Civil War to hold the union together. He urged the people there to read King's speech and talk to people who endured discrimination in their lives. Sharpton warned conservative forces they'd face a fight in the upcoming elections, and called on people to turn out to vote this year as they did in 2008, when Obama was elected. ""We're coming out to fight and we're not going to let you turn back the clock,"" he said. Other well-known public figures spoke, including National Urban League President and CEO Marc Morial, who said, ""We will not stand silent as some seek to hijack, as some seek to distort and contort, as some seek to bamboozle and confuse the vision of Dr. King's dream."" Morehouse College President Robert Franklin indicated that King was treated respectfully by the conservatives. ""I am delighted to know that Mr. Glenn Beck and his colleagues discovered the 'I Have a Dream' speech,"" he said. But, he added, Beck needs to travel to Morehouse, the Atlanta college King attended, to learn what King studied -- citing, for example, the works of religious thinkers who influenced the late civil rights leader. A couple of speakers also noted the passing of Dorothy Height earlier this year. Height, a civil rights pioneer, had been chair and president emeritus of the National Council of Negro Women and was on the podium with King during the 1963 speech. The ""I Have a Dream"" speech -- delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial -- served as a symbol of the fight against racial discrimination. It was made during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, and is considered one of the most pivotal and memorable of American speeches. CNN's Sarah Lee contributed to this report.","NEW: Sharpton calls Beck's comments a ""motivational speech""

"(CNN) -- A body found in southeast Memphis, Tennessee, on Wednesday has been identified as that of former professional basketball player Lorenzen Wright, Memphis police said. The cause of death has been ruled as ""homicide by gunshot wound,"" police said Thursday in a news release, adding that the Shelby County medical examiner used dental records to confirm Wright's identity. ""Investigators continue to work around the clock to bring justice to Mr. Wright and his family,"" the police department said in a statement. Before that confirmation, Wright's family had already said that they were mourning his loss. Wright's cousin, Camella Logan, had released a statement to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper saying, ""We appreciate your thoughts, prayers and condolences as they are comforting at this very difficult time."" Wright, who has a home in Atlanta, was reported missing on July 22. He had been visiting with his former wife and their children in Collierville, near Memphis, investigators said. Wright was last seen at his former wife's home shortly before midnight on July 18, and a 911 call was placed from his phone in the early hours of July 19, police said. His body was found on Wednesday by Shelby County Emergency Services Search and Rescue, police said. Dewayne Benton, a Christian radio personality in Memphis, said he left work early to investigate reports his station received about the body. Benton described the crowded crime scene as somber. ""Lorenzen Wright had a lot of financial problems ... but this was just horrible,"" said Benton. ""He was one of the favorite sons of Memphis,"" he added. The 6-foot-11-inch Wright was a high school basketball star in Memphis, and he played professionally for the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies from 2001 through 2006. ""We are deeply saddened by the tragic death of Lorenzen Wright,"" the team's majority owner, Michael Heisley, said in a statement on the Grizzlies' website. ""We lost a member of the Grizzlies family."" During his 13-year professional basketball career Wright also played with the Los Angeles Clippers, Sacramento Kings and most recently with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Wright did two tours with the Atlanta Hawks as well, from 1999 to 2001 and from 2006 to 2008. Former Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens said, ""Lorenzen was a real congenial young man who played with a lot of enthusiasm. This is certainly a huge loss for his family and friends.""

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Wildfires in Russia, among the worst ever there, have killed 25 people, destroyed more than 1,000 homes, and prompted the prime minister to call on local officials to resign, response officials and Russian news agencies reported Friday. The fires have been raging in five regions as Russia endures dry weather and one of the hottest months on record. Thursday saw Moscow reach 102 Fahrenheit (39 Celsius), the highest temperature since records began in 1879. The fires are the worst ever to hit the European part of Russia, the region west of the Ural Mountains, the RIA-Novosti news agency said. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said there have been 21,690 fires so far this summer, 10 percent more than last year, the news agency reported. President Dmitry Medvedev ordered the Defense Ministry on Friday to use the military to help tackle the fires, the president's spokeswoman, Natalya Timakova, told the Interfax news agency. The government has already dispatched additional firefighting units, along with 16 aircraft and helicopters, to fight the fires, RIA-Novosti said. Putin and Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu flew Friday to one of the affected regions, Nizhny Novgorod, where Putin called on local officials to step down. ""I recommend the resignation of the heads of regions (devastated by fire) who have, to a significant degree, lost the trust of citizens,"" Putin said, according to RIA-Novosti. Many residents who lost their homes in Nizhny Novgorod had complained to Putin that local authorities' actions were ""chaotic and uncoordinated,"" RIA-Novosti reported. The fires have so far killed 25 people, including two firefighters, according to an official at the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry. Across the 14 fire-striken regions of central Russia, 1,257 homes have burned, and some 2,000 people have been left without housing. Sixty homes were burned in the region of Moscow. ""I don't know what to do,"" one Voronezh woman told state TV. ""Haven't got any bed linen, cups, spoons, forks left. We're left with nothing. Everything was burned down. We couldn't salvage anything."" Putin said the families of those who died will receive 1 million rubles ($33,000) each in compensation, and the government will pay around 3 million rubles ($100,000) for the reconstruction of each destroyed house, RIA-Novosti said. Putin also said the government will compensate people for the loss of property, the news agency said. Temperatures across much of western and central Russia have topped 95 Fahrenheit (35 Celsius) during the past five weeks, RIA-Novosti said. Thursday's temperature in Moscow broke the previous record high of 99.5 Fahrenheit (37.5 Celsius), set just three days earlier. The month of July is expected to break the record for the hottest month ever recorded in Moscow. High temperatures in Moscow dropped to between 82 and 86 Fahrenheit (28 to 30 Celsius) Friday because of a breeze, but weekend temperatures were forecast to rise again. The threat of more fires breaking out will remain high in the Central and Volga Federal Districts next week, given the abnormal heart wave and the lack of rain, the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia has reported on its web site. The hot, dry weather is believed to have dried out large parts of land, making it easier for flames to spread. Central Russia also has large areas of peat bogs that often catch on fire in dry and hot weather. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.","NEW: Two firefighters are among the dead .

"(CNN) -- A top lieutenant in a Mexican drug cartel has been arrested in northern Mexico, federal police said in a statement Wednesday. Rogelio Segovia Hernandez, who heads the armed wing of the Juarez cartel, was arrested in Chihuahua on Tuesday. A reward of about $240,000 had been offered for his arrest, federal police said. Authorities said at the time of his arrest, he had a pistol, grenade and at least six bags of an undisclosed amount of cocaine. Intelligence provided by the federal police indicated Segovia, 30, was the principal operator for La Linea in the activities of drug trafficking distribution, kidnappings and killings in towns near Ciudad Juarez as well as Chihuahua. Segovia was being investigated in extortion of large sums of money from businessmen in exchange for ""freedom from aggression"" from La Linea, according to police. He was also a suspect in the August 25th, 2008, execution of five people at a ranch in the town of Aldama, Chihuahua. The Mexican attorney general's office offered a reward for Segovia's capture in May.","Rogelio Segovia Hernandez heads the armed wing of the Juarez cartel .

""Even though they are fun, you don't need them."" Zach plans to use the proceeds for a good cause: helping his unemployed father. Tom McGuire, a licensed contractor in Toledo, Ohio, has not had a job since December. The economy is partly to blame, he said, adding that he did a job last summer and never got paid. As the general contractor on the job, he said, he was financially liable for materials and the work of two subcontractors. ""I'm out $30,000,"" McGuire said. The father said he is looking for work and is not relying on money from his son's toy sales. But he appreciates his effort. ""Zach has a big, giving heart,"" McGuire said.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- The leaders of Syria and Saudi Arabia on Friday implored Lebanese officials to shun violence in settling political differences and declared their ""solidarity with Lebanon against all Israeli threats."" Syrian President Bashar Assad and Saudi King Abdullah sat down Friday with Lebanese President Michel Suleiman and met with Lebanese politicians from various factions in an attempt to avoid Shiite-Sunni conflict ahead of the release of a U.N. tribunal indictment in the 2005 assassination of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. It has been rumored that Hezbollah operatives will be blamed for the killing, a seminal event in Lebanon. Rafik Hariri died in a powerful explosion that left a 10-foot crater in a street in downtown Beirut and had a similar impact on Lebanon's political culture. Assad and Abdullah traveled to Beirut from Syria, where they met Thursday. Suleiman issued a communique saying both men ""held talks with Lebanese officials and discussed ways on how to enhance the national reconciliation and the internal stability in Lebanon and how to improve opportunities for economic growth and social development."" The communique said the two asserted their empathy for Lebanon because of ""the daily Israeli breaches of Lebanese sovereignty, independence and Israel's attempts to destabilize the Lebanese nation."" They ""stressed the importance of continuing to support the Doha agreement,"" a pact reached by Lebanese rival movements in 2008, and to ""complete the implementation of the Taif agreement,"" an accord developed to end the Lebanese civil war. The leaders urged the importance of ""everyone's commitment not to resort to violence and to place Lebanon's interest above any interest of any faction, and to be part of the legal and constitutional institutions and the Government of National Unity in order to resolve any differences. The Syrian and Saudi Arabia leaders expressed their continued support for Lebanon and the Lebanese president and the interests of Lebanon and its people."" After the visit, Abdullah went to Jordan and Assad traveled home to Syria. Ibrahim Mousawi, a Hezbollah spokesman, said the group ""welcomes any kind of any Arab coordination and unity"" and said the summit will play an important role in ""repelling the Israeli threats in Lebanon and in the region as a whole."" ""The region is facing many challenges and pressures by the Israelis amidst all the talks about a new war in the region and Israel's crimes in expelling the Palestinians, judaizing Jerusalem and threatening the entire region with their scheme against our nation and the rest of the Arab world,"" he maintained. Hezbollah and Israel fought a bitter war in 2006 after militants seized two Israeli soldiers and killed three others. The significance of the visit is that Assad and Abdullah have backed different political movements in Lebanon since the killing, with Saudi Arabia backing Prime Minister Saad Hariri, the son of Rafik Hariri, and Syria supporting Hezbollah, which has representatives in parliament and a presence in the government. Rafik Hariri's death stunned the nation at the time and prompted tens of thousands to take to the streets, blaming Syria for the killing. At the time of the killing, neighboring Syria had immense political influence in Lebanon. Syria has always denied the accusations of being involved in the assassination. A U.N. Security Council resolution demanded Damascus fully cooperate in the U.N. investigation. The assassination and subsequent investigation led to a complete withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon after 30 years of military presence. The investigation by the U.N. tribunal into the killing is still going on, and the tribunal's prosecutor, Daniel Bellemare, is expected to issue the long-awaited indictment between September and December 2010. It is Assad's first visit to Lebanon since Rafik Hariri was assassinated. Both leaders last visited Lebanon in 2002 for an Arab League summit to launch the Middle East peace process. Last week, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said he believes that the tribunal will blame elements of his party, but said he would reject any such conclusion. He also said that any indictment of a Hezbollah member would represent a U.S.-Israeli effort to disarm Hezbollah's militant wing. The United States considers Hezbollah, which has close ties to Iran and Syria, to be a terrorist organization. The Shiite group is a political party and a major provider of social services in Lebanon but also operates a militant wing. Nasrallah, in a rare press conference, said Hariri's son, current Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, had told him that the special tribunal would implicate rogue Hezbollah members for the killing, but not the party itself. ""I told Hariri when he accused Syria to bring us one single proof and I will stand by your side and support you, but you cannot allow the instigation against Hezbollah and the Shiites in Lebanon to continue,"" Nasrallah said. Nasrallah said forces inside and outside Lebanon ""don't want the stability in the country to last."" Among many Muslims, Hezbollah is seen as a heroic organization, successful in having driven Israeli forces from Lebanon in 2006. In previous parliamentary elections, the so-called March 14 coalition -- parties association with Saad Hariri -- campaigned on a platform to disarm Hezbollah and opposed Hezbollah's 2006 war with Israel. ""In the last five years, some Lebanese politicians dragged the country into a bigger battle that targeted everyone,"" Nasrallah said. ""Every day we were on the verge of a new civil war and we are all victims of a bigger plot that wanted to destroy the resistance in Lebanon. ""These same politicians want to drag Lebanon into that same phase once again. ""So I ask their supporters: Do you really want to stand by these leaders, despite all what happened? Despite everything they have done?"" This week, U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley, asked about the meeting, said the United States values ""dialogue"" among the three leaders. He said he suspects Israeli-Palestinian peace moves and other items could be part of the discussions. ""Syria's relationship with Iran is of concern to us. And to the extent that Syria wants to advance its relations within the region and around the world, it would be, you know, much better for Syria to distance itself from Iran and move in a more constructive direction."" He also said, ""We think that President Assad and other Syrian leaders should listen very attentively, you know, to what King Abdullah will tell them.""

"(Mashable) -- Good news for everyone out there who's ever thought to themselves: ""A 10-minute video of my cat eating ribs on the kitchen floor is just too short."" YouTube announced Thursday that it has increased its upload limit from 10 minutes to 15 for non-partners. So get kitty lookin' pretty and start rolling! So why add the extra five-spot now? Well, on the YouTube blog, the video-sharing site explains that it's been beefing up its copyright protection tools of late, i.e. the Content ID system (which lets copyright holders have more control over their content). Therefore, it's less likely that users can, say, upload large chunks of movies and TV shows without permission.

"(CNN) -- Whether you're into baseball or backgammon, Harry Potter or heavy metal, Ning has an online network for you. Gina Bianchini, CEO of Ning, says her site brings together people with common interest and passions. A fast-growing, free Web site launched two years ago, Ning lets members custom build their own social-networking platforms based around their passions and pastimes. As Facebook and MySpace connect people to friends and family, Ning gathers users around common interests. The site hosts networks for hip-hop music lovers, video gaming moms and teens obsessed with the Twilight book and movie franchise. Other popular Ning networks bring people together online for political and social causes such as ""Pickens' Plan,"" which advocates wind energy. Ning had 4.7 million unique visitors as of January and surpassed 1 million social networks -- about one-fifth of them considered active -- last month. Ning also enhanced its site in March with new features such as a real-time activity feed so users can get up-to-the-minute reports -- not unlike Twitter's tweets -- about what others are doing. CNN spoke recently to Ning CEO Gina Bianchini, a Silicon Valley native and former Goldman Sachs analyst, about the company and the future of social networking.  Watch Bianchini chat about Ning ¬ª . CNN: Where did this idea for Ning come from? Bianchini: We really started with a very simple premise. What if you gave people the opportunity to create their own social experiences for their own unique passions/topics/interest? We started on the ground floor to build it in such a way that it can be customized and programmed and made truly unique for each individual. I believe the most powerful ideas are the most simple. CNN: What is the mission of Ning? Bianchini: It's a way to get people to organize and get people to meet around their passions. CNN: Did any specific Web sites or companies inspire you to create Ning? Bianchini: We were really inspired by the first wave of Internet companies truly native to the Web like Craigslist and eBay. They were really around people connecting to other people. They were really about the Internet connecting people to each other. It's completely unique to the Internet -- you can't do it via television or newspapers. CNN: Did you expect the idea of connecting people though common interests to be so successful? Bianchini: Social behavior is really what people want to do online. It was clear for the rapid adoption of social networking in general that it is very much the case. CNN: What are some of the interesting social networks on Ning? Bianchini: There are 200,000 social networks are active right now, and they are across tens of thousands of unique passions. There is a network called 'This is 50.' It's like a hip hop TMZ. Another is the 'Pickens' Plan.' It's a way they are organizing more than 200,000 people around wind-energy policy. There is another one for cricket, specifically Indian cricket, which has added half a million people in the last two and a half weeks. There is another about the Twilight saga for teens. So it ranges from 50 Cent to teens talking about Twilight to serious adults looking at how to make changes in government policy. That's the power of the Internet and the power of connecting people. CNN: What do you attribute to the growth of Ning? Bianchini: What's fundamental in the adoption of Ning is that people are unique. They have unique interest and passion and they like having a contact for that experience and for their identity. CNN: What makes Ning different from other social-networking sites? Bianchini: It's focused on providing the [means for] people to create new social networks around their interests and passions and connect new people around those passions. We think that's a very critical element of organization. The Facebook phenomenon connects you to people you already know and Twitter is amazing for news and real-time events. What we see with people who gravitate to Ning is meeting new people with similar interests. CNN: How can Ning be useful to organizations or corporations? Bianchini: When you can bring people together around a common cause there is incredible potential to do fundraising and to organize volunteers. CNN: How does your site make money? Bianchini: If you want to add a feature like making your own domain, you can pay a la carte for options. On the free service there are ads contextual to what the network is. CNN: What are your thoughts on the future of social networking? Bianchini: Niche social networking sites are absolutely something people want  to do. People clearly want to do this. . .[and] as people get more comfortable with social networking via Facebook, Twitter, they will look around and say, 'I want a social network for this particular group.' CNN: What are some of your company's goals in the future? Bianchini: We are really focused on making our service perfect for people who come to meet new people. We're growing really rapidly and we're seeing a lot of interest and new people joining social networks.","CNN talks to Gina Bianchini, CEO of Ning, a fast-growing Web site .

"(CNN) -- A 29-year-old U.S. citizen and Army veteran sits in a bare apartment in a poor part of the Colombian capital, Bogota. He wants to come home, but he can't. He thinks it's because he's on the federal government's ""no-fly list."" Raymond Earl Knaeble is one of an unknown number of Americans stranded overseas. They can't fly home, but no one will tell them why. In Knaeble's case, he went to the airport in Bogota on March 14 to board a plane for Miami, Florida. ""I had a job offered to me and one of the requirements to secure the job was that I had to take a medical exam. It was scheduled for March 16 in the U.S.,"" Knaeble said. When he arrived at the gate, however, an airline official denied him a boarding pass. He was instructed to contact the U.S. Embassy in Bogota. ""They told me I couldn't fly with the airline, with any airline,"" he said. ""My heart sank. They didn't give me a reason why. I've been stuck in Colombia without any explanation."" Knaeble, a resident of California, believes he has been placed on the federal no-fly list. The list is maintained by the FBI and indicates who might be a risk to civil aviation, specifically those suspected of being domestic or international terrorists. This list is disseminated among various government agencies like the Transportation Security Administration, for use in screening passengers. ""My plan was to go do my medical screening in the U.S., spend time with my family, secure my job and come back to Colombia to get my wife,"" Knaeble said. ""Then everything changed. The company retracted my offer and I lost the job."" He flew to Colombia in March from Kuwait to marry his then-fiance and said he encountered no problems. He had been living in Kuwait since 2006 working for ITT Systems, the same company that offered him the new position as a heavy mobile equipment mechanic in Qatar. Knaeble converted to Islam in 2008 and with others created a website about the religion's teachings. Nothing on the site suggests it condones violence, and in a statement to CNN, Knaeble said: ""People have a lot of misconceptions about Islam, but the truth is that Islam is a religion of peace. It means peace."" With a daughter living in Texas, his new wife pregnant with his second child and a fast-evaporating bank account, Knaeble says he is running out of options. ""My wife's family has given a little bit of help, but if I didn't have any money saved up, I'd be homeless right now,"" he said. He is currently living in Santa Marta, Colombia. ""It's really simple. I've got a bed and a little table. ... I don't even have a refrigerator in my home,"" he said. ""I've just been surviving."" Unable to get answers, on June 30 Knaeble and nine others who are either citizens or legal residents of the United States filed a lawsuit, aided by the American Civil Liberties Union, against Attorney General Eric Holder, FBI Director Robert Mueller and Timothy Healy, head of the Terrorist Screening Center. ""Our clients have done nothing wrong,"" said Nusrat Choudhury, a staff attorney with the ACLU who is helping to represent Knaeble and the others. ""When [the government] puts them on a list that impacts their lives, their ability to see family, to get jobs, the government has to give them a chance to stand up for themselves."" Knaeble has tried other ways to get home. In May he planned to fly from Colombia to Mexico and then cross the U.S.-Mexico border by land. But he was greeted at the gate in Mexico City by government agents. They detained him and questioned him about his recent conversion to Islam. Fifteen hours later, he says, he was put on a plane back to Bogota. Knaeble's mother, Patricia, who lives in Ventura, California, says that she speaks with her son almost every day. ""He's called me a couple of times where I feel the pain, I feel the fear and I can't do a thing,"" Patricia Knaeble said. ""It's the worst feeling for a parent. I have gone out of my way to find out why and no one can tell me. He calls and there is nothing else I can do. "" Finding out whether you are on the no-fly list is a matter of trial and error, and sometimes begins with a humiliating and unexpected moment at an airport check-in desk. The list is not made public. The Department of Homeland Security has created the Traveler Redress Inquiry Program, known as TRIP, so that people who have been prevented from flying can request a review of their status. ""There are two problems with this process,"" said Choudhury, the ACLU attorney. ""First, the DHS doesn't control who is on the list, the FBI does. So this whole program is controlled by an agency that has no authority. Secondly, the response sent by the government is hardly satisfactory."" The determination of redress can be viewed via a ""status page"" on the Department of Homeland Security's website. The update indicates whether an individual's case is in process, has been completed or requires more information. The website also says that ""security procedures and legal concerns mandate that we can neither confirm nor deny any information about you that may be within federal watch lists."" So the individual must try to take another flight to see if they have been removed from the list. An additional guideline from the TRIP program articulates that anyone who files for redress will be asked for additional documentation within 30 days. Knaeble sent in his redress form on March 26. He says he has yet to hear anything. The FBI said that it is unable to comment on whether Knaeble is on the no-fly list. But in a written statement, the bureau said that ""several recent high-profile attempted terror plots ... remind us of the need to remain vigilant and thoroughly investigate every lead to fend off any potential threats to the U.S."" Transportation Security Administration spokeswoman Kristen Lee said she is unable to comment on the case because of the ongoing litigation with the ACLU. One man who was caught up in the same dilemma but eventually was allowed to return home is Yahye Wehelie, who lives in Virginia. He had been studying Arabic in Yemen with his brother. On the way home he was prevented from boarding a plane in Cairo. He was stuck in the Egyptian capital for six weeks, with little money. Wehelie was finally permitted to leave Egypt on a waiver and temporary passport. While in Cairo, Wehelie was ""hanging out in a cheap hotel watching TV and periodically going to fast food restaurants in the area,"" said Ibrahim Hooper, national communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. CAIR helped Wehelie to return home. According to Hooper, Wehelie's permanent passport was revoked and can only be regained if he repays a loan to the U.S. Embassy that helped cover his food and hotel costs. The State Department said the U.S. Embassy in Cairo offers assistance to anyone who asks but would not disclose details about the reported loan. Despite his experiences, Wehelie supports the ""no-fly list."" ""If this is something that's going to help my country and stop bad people from doing what they do, I'm happy for it,"" Wehelie said. For his part, Knaeble continues to look for creative ways to travel home. He is currently looking into traveling by boat. He says the earliest he would be able to do so would be in October aboard a cargo ship headed for Florida. ""What's happening to people like Ray, these are U.S. citizens who have a right to come back to the country in which they are citizens,"" said Choudhury. ""Right now, what this is, it is involuntary exile."" And exile brings its own risks. Earlier this month, Knaeble's authorization to stay in Colombia expired and he fears arrest if he is unable to have it renewed. ""It's really scary because I don't know what's going to happen to me, to my family,"" he said. ""There shouldn't be any reason for this. No one has given me any reason.""","Raymond Earl Knaeble has not been allowed to fly home from Colombia .

"New York (CNN) -- After accusations that several insurers have underpaid families of those killed in action, one company is considering changing how it allocates death benefit payments, Prudential Financial Vice Chairman Mark Grier told CNN. Prudential may give families the option of accepting a direct lump-sum check, Grier said. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo launched a fraud investigation into the life insurance industry for ""practices that appear to have denied grieving military families and others of millions in life-insurance cash,"" Cuomo's office announced Thursday. The attorney general's office probed the industry the day after the finance publication Bloomberg reported the insurance companies potentially exploited fallen soldier's families. Bloomberg said some insurers tell families of fallen military personnel that policy payouts will be placed in an interest-bearing account. But the bulk of the interest benefits the insurers, and the cash is not placed in banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Insurers place cash in their corporate accounts, reportedly earning up to 4.8 percent interest while paying families as little as 0.5 percent interest, Bloomberg reported. ""It is shocking and just plain wrong for these multinational life insurance companies to pocket hundreds of millions in profits that really belong to those who have lost family members and have already suffered immensely,"" Cuomo said. Currently, Prudential, which met with officials at the Veterans Administration, gives a family several payment options, including setting up a ""lump sum"" that, rather than sending a check to the surviving family, sets up an ""Alliance Account"" within Prudential. The money stays in Prudential's hands, which, paying only .5 percent interest to the family, can invest at large profits, Cuomo said. Cuomo's office said holders of Alliance Accounts receive what appears to be a checkbook with ""JPMorgan Chase & Co."" on the ""checks,"" but said the so-called checks cannot be used to make purchases and are not bank checks at all. ""Instead, Prudential must send money to JPMorgan Chase before the checks can clear,"" the attorney general's office said. ""Prudential beneficiaries are also not informed that, under a 2008 law, they have one year to place the death benefits in a Roth IRA and earn tax-free investment gains for the rest of their lives. Thus, real financial harm is suffered by Prudential's lack of disclosure."" Prudential says the Alliance Accounts provide a secure, conservative option for survivors. Beneficiaries who find a better interest rate can move the money at any time, it says. Subpoenas have been served on eight insurance companies -- Prudential Financial Inc., MetLife Inc., Genworth Financial Inc., UnumProvident Corp., Northwestern Mutual, Guardian Life Insurance Company of America, New York Life Insurance Co., and the MONY Life Insurance Co. -- though the entire life insurance industry is under investigation, according to the attorney general's office. The accounts in question include Prudential's Alliance Account and MetLife's Total Control Account. Steven Weisbart, senior vice president and chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, says the banks are doing nothing out of the ordinary. ""It's completely premature, blown way out of proportion. What the industry does, what insurance companies do in these cases is exactly what beneficiaries need,"" Weisbart said. ""The opportunity to put off making decisions about the use of large amounts of money without suffering any financial loss. That's exactly what this product, this arrangement does. I don't know why the Cuomo organization would attack it the way they have."" In a written statement, Prudential Chairman and CEO John Strangfeld said, ""It is important that the beneficiaries of our fallen service men and women are treated with dignity and respect during a very difficult time. Given the questions raised over the life insurance program we administer for the Department of Veteran Affairs, we welcome an opportunity to address the concerns and to set the record straight."" Prudential said that while the accounts in question are not FDIC insured, the accounts are protected by state guaranty funds that provide protection of at least $250,000 in most states. ""Prudential does not in any way take money from beneficiaries,"" the company said. In a written statement, MetLife spokesman John Calagna said Thursday he has not seen Cuomo's subpoena and therefore had no comment on it. ""However we strongly disagree with many misleading statements in recent media reports and want to be clear regarding several important features of MetLife's Total Control Account ('TCA'),"" Calagna said. He said MetLife is not the issuer of the Service Employees Group Life Insurance program provided to members of the armed forces, but the company does provide life insurance policies for civilian federal employees under a program called Federal Employees Group Life Insurance. ""Our materials carefully explain the TCA to our customers so that they understand that they can use their checkbooks to withdraw all of their benefits immediately or over time as they choose,"" Calagna said. ""They have full access to their funds and earn a guaranteed minimum interest rate that exceeds what they could earn on most money market accounts."" Prudential said more than 40,000 Alliance Account drafts cleared last year, and the company receives few complaints from beneficiaries about difficulties. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said he learned Thursday that families of deceased military members did not get a lump-sum payment for life insurance policies. ""Until today, I actually believed that the families of our fallen heroes got a check for the full amount of their benefit,"" Gates said during a briefing at the Pentagon. ""So this came as news to me.  And so I will just say I will be very interested in the outcome of"" an investigation. The Veterans Administration said it is conducting ""a full investigation"" to make sure survivors are fully protected and being treated with care and respect. ""The possibility that life insurance companies may be profiting inappropriately from these service members' sacrifice is completely unacceptable,"" the VA said in a statement. ""VA is deeply concerned that military and veteran families may potentially be harmed in some way by the use of the Alliance Account program."" At the conclusion of the investigation, the VA said, the agency will determine whether to continue use of the Alliance Account program. The VA also will contact the approximately 10,000 survivors to remind them of their options under the Service Employees Group Life Insurance program.","NEW: Prudential is considering changing how it allocates death benefits to surviving military family members .

"Washington (CNN) -- Major league pitching legend Roger Clemens pleaded not guilty Monday to charges that he lied to Congress during a 2008 investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. Clemens has been charged with perjury, obstruction of Congress and making false statements after telling lawmakers in February 2008 that he never used human growth hormone or steroids. U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton set an April 5 trial date for the seven-time Cy Young winner at Monday's arraignment. The proceedings were held in the largest courtroom at the District of Columbia federal courthouse, one usually used for high-profile cases such as the trial of former White House aide Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby. Before the arraignment, Clemens ate lunch at the courthouse cafeteria with his attorneys and was approached by at least three fans. Clemens was released on his own recognizance after the hearing and was headed to a charity golf event in South Carolina. He has denied the perjury allegations and said he looks forward to defending himself in court. ""I never took HGH or Steroids. And I did not lie to Congress,"" he said in a message posted to his Twitter account August 19, the day his indictment was released. Clemens, nicknamed ""the Rocket"" during his 24-year career, left baseball in 2007 after playing for the Boston Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays, Houston Astros and New York Yankees. The charges stem the pitcher's 2008 appearance before the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee, when he vehemently denied using performance-enhancing drugs. Steroid use ""is totally incompatible with who I am and what I stand for,"" he told lawmakers, adding, ""I cannot in good conscience admit to doing something that I did not do, even if it would be easier to do so."" His testimony put him at odds with his former trainer, Brian McNamee, and a report by former Sen. George Mitchell that stated Clemens had used banned substances at points in his career. Onetime teammate Andy Pettite told a league investigation led by Mitchell that Clemens admitted using human growth hormone. A few weeks later, the committee's leaders asked the Justice Department to launch a perjury probe of Clemens. Rep. Henry Waxman, the committee's chairman at the time, said after Clemens' indictment that perjury and false statements ""are serious crimes that undermine the ability of Congress to perform its duties."" The six-count indictment accuses Clemens of trying to ""influence, obstruct, and impede"" the congressional investigation into the use of steroids. It includes three counts of making false statements to investigators about the use of human growth hormone, steroids and vitamin B12, and two counts of perjury stemming from his appearance before Waxman's committee. Clemens told investigators that Pettite -- who admitted to using human growth hormone on two occasions himself -- must have ""misheard"" him, and he accused McNamee of lying ""to save his own skin"" as federal authorities began probing the use of steroids in major sports. He filed a defamation suit against his ex-trainer in late 2008. He said the shots he received from his trainer were vitamin B12, which is an allowed substance. But according to the indictment, the trainer never had access to B12 and never injected Clemens with such supplements. CNN's Paul Courson and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: Clemens released on his own recognizance after not-guilty plea .

"(CNN) -- An appeals court ruling has raised the possibility that Guatemalan women will be able to seek asylum in the United States because of the high rates of femicide in that country. A Guatemalan woman seeking asylum based on her belief that she would not be safe in her native country will have her case reviewed, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday. Lesly Yajayra Perdomo, a native of Guatemala who entered the United States illegally as a teenager to join her mother in 1991, was facing deporation in 2003. She requested asylum ""because she feared persecution as a member of a particular social group consisting of women between the ages of fourteen and forty,"" according to the court document. In particular, Perdomo argued that women in Guatemala ""were murdered at a high rate with impunity."" An immigration judge denied her claim, and the Board of Immigration Appeals upheld the decision. Monday's ruling remands the case to the BIA for further proceedings. Perdomo, who lives in Reno, Nevada, and works as a Medicaid account executive at a medical facility there, is not assured asylum, but the decision gives her and countless other Guatemalan women the possibility of remaining in the United States. A key issue in the case is whether Guatemalan women are too broad of a group to be considered a protected ""particular social group"" eligible for asylum. That's what the BIA decided when it upheld the immigration judge's ruling, calling it ""merely a demographic division ... rather than a particular social group."" The three-judge panel at the appeals court, however, found that the decision was ""inconsistent with its own precedent and this court's case law."" It is important to note that the appeals court stopped short of saying Perdomo deserved asylum, only saying that she was eligible for it, Kevin Johnson, Dean of the University of California-Davis Law School, told CNN. Proving that Perdomo will face persecution if she is returned to Guatemala and that the country doesn't protect its young women will be hard to prove, he said. Any other Guatemalan women hoping to take advantage of this week's ruling will have to do the same. ""I don't think there's going to be a flood of Guatemalan women applying for asylum tomorrow,"" Johnson said. ""This is part of a trend among U.S. courts to ensure women are afforded protection under asylum laws."" According to Amnesty International, between 2001 and 2006, more than 1,900 Guatemalan women and girls were killed. Many of those killings involved sexual violence and ""exceptional cruelty,"" the organization said.","An appeals court remanded the case of a Guatemalan woman seeking asylum in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- The number of illegal immigrants living in the United States continues to decline from a peak in 2007, according to a report released Wednesday by the Pew Hispanic Center. The center estimated that in March 2009 -- the most recent figures -- there were 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants in the country, compared to 12 million in March 2007. ""The decrease represents the first significant reversal in the growth of this population over the past two decades,"" the report states. The report does not discuss what factors could be behind the decrease. The decrease represents an 8 percent decline from 2007 to 2009 in the number of illegal immigrants currently living in the United States. According to the report, the most marked decline was in the population of unauthorized immigrants who come from Latin American countries other than Mexico. This group, which includes illegal immigrants from the Caribbean, Central and South America, saw a decrease of 22 percent in the same 2007-2009 period. In comparison, the Mexican unauthorized population has leveled off at about 7 million since 2007, the report states. Mexicans account for about 60 percent of all illegal immigrants. The report coincides with other studies showing that while the influx of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico has sharply decreased, unauthorized Mexicans living in the United States are staying put. According to the report, an average of 150,000 illegal immigrants from Mexico arrived yearly during the March 2007 to March 2009 period, compared to the average of 500,000 that was recorded during the first half of the decade. For all countries, the average number of new unauthorized immigrants arriving fell from 550,000 a year in 2005 to 300,000 a year in 2009.. The authors of the report point out, however, that despite the decline, the population of unauthorized immigrants was nearly a third larger in 2009 compared to 2000, and it is three times larger than in 1990. Among the report's other findings was that nearly half of unauthorized immigrants living in the country in 2009 arrived in 2000 or later. The methodology the authors used took a demographic estimate of the legal foreign-born population in the United States, and subtracted it from the total foreign-born population. The Pew Hispanic Center is a part of the Pew Research Center in Washington and is an independent research group that does not engage in advocacy or take positions on issues.","The unauthorized immigrant population in the United States has decreased, the study says .

"(CNN) -- A man suspected in the shooting deaths of five people at a Lake Havasu City, Arizona, residence on Saturday night was found dead early Sunday of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to police. The killings began just before midnight Saturday when police say 26-year-old Brian Diez entered the residence, shot six people and abducted two children from the home, according to a press release from the Lake Havasu City Police Department. Four of the victims were pronounced dead. Two others were transported to local hospitals, where one of them died of his injuries. According to an Amber Alert issued Sunday for the missing children, Diez, their father, was locked in a custody battle with their mother, identified by police as 23-year-old Deborah Langstaff. Langstaff was among the five people killed. A little more than three hours after the shootings, Lake Havasu police investigators discovered that Diez's vehicle was parked at a home in Rancho Cucamonga, California, more than 250 miles away from the site of the killings. At about the same time, local sheriff's deputies were dispatched to the same residence, responding to a report of a suicide. ""Deputies arrived and found Diez deceased of an apparent self-inflicted gun shot wound,"" police said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- A 45-year-old man who barricaded himself in his home after allegedly shooting two rural Alaska police officers to death surrendered Monday morning and was charged with two counts of first-degree murder, authorities said. John Marvin Jr. gave up without incident around 9:30 a.m. (1:30 p.m. ET), according to a statement from the Division of Alaska State Troopers. Hoonah, Alaska, officers Matthew Tokuoka, 39, and Sgt. Anthony Wallace, 32, were shot Saturday in what troopers described as an ambush. Both officers later died from their injuries. Gov. Sean Parnell ordered state flags to be lowered to half-staff Monday in honor of the fallen officers, calling their deaths ""a tragic loss for Alaska and the community of Hoonah."" ""These men had a passion for serving and protecting Alaskans and our state is better because of their commitment to excellence,"" Parnell said in a statement. After the shooting, Marvin barricaded himself inside his home, according to Alaska television station KTUU. State troopers sent several special emergency response teams, and police from Juneau also deployed a tactical team, Alaska State Troopers said in a news release. The U.S. Coast Guard assisted in bringing resources into Hoonah, an Alaska Panhandle town on an island about 62 miles north of Sitka, Alaska, and 68 miles west of Juneau by ferry. ""We are thankful this incident resolved without further loss of life or injury,"" Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety Joe Masters said. ""Now that this incident has resolved, the community of Hoonah can hopefully start the healing process. The shooting leaves the town of Hoonah, which has a population of about 800 people, with only one police officer -- the police chief, TV station KTUU said. State troopers were providing staffing for Hoonah police. Businesses in the area were shut down, according to KTUU, and residents were asked to stay indoors and away from the area until the standoff ended. ""We heard a gunshot and one of my co-workers looked out the window and he saw one policeman down,"" witness Dirk Knehr told the television station. ""He'd been shot, and another policeman was trying to drag him away and the suspect shot him twice. And then he just took off."" Little was known about Marvin, KTUU said. ""The only information we have is that he's had problems with law enforcement in that community in the past, and there were some issues of stability,"" Alaska State Troopers Capt. Barry Wilson told the station. The shooting occurred about 10:30 p.m. Saturday, KTUU said. Wallace began working with Hoonah police in 2008, according to the station. He was a 2008 graduate of the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York, and a former campus police officer at the school. ""Tony, who was hard-of-hearing, proved remarkable at many levels,"" the institute said in a statement on its website. After joining campus police, he went on to attend the police academy, where he graduated as class valedictorian. An All-American wrestler, he was inducted into the school's Athletic Hall of Fame in 2008. The institute's statement quoted from an interview Wallace did last year with the university's news department. ""I hope that people who are in the same situation as I am see my story and begin to believe that if you put your mind to something, you can achieve it,"" he said. ""Anything and everything is possible, it's just a matter of how bad you want it and how far you are willing to go to prove to people that you are worthy of whatever career you want to pursue."" Tokuoka, a former Marine Corps staff sergeant, was a native of Hawaii who had been with Hoonah police since 2009, KTUU said. Planning for a memorial service for the fallen officers is under way.","NEW: John Marvin Jr. is charged with two counts of first-degree murder .

"(Rolling Stone)  -- The long-gestating Tupac Shakur movie may finally begin production this November, now that director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"") has brought on Oscar-nominated screenwriters Stephen J. Rivele and Chris Wilkinson to pen a new script. Wilkinson tells Vulture that the film, originally written in a documentary style, will not be a biopic. Instead, it will focus onTupac's last day, and flash back on the four years that preceded his still-unsolved shooting death in Las Vegas. ""He was just beginning to shed that anger and look for a purer voice ... He was in the process of changing himself, and entering a new phase of his life,"" says Rivele, who previously teamed with Wilkinson to script ""Ali"" and ""Nixon.""

"(CNN) -- Tragedy struck at a Pennsylvania circus Friday after a startled elephant stomped its trainer to death, police said. People at the Irem Shrine in Wilkes-Barre, which has been hosting the James Hamid Circus all week, rushed to help but not before the trainer sustained life-threatening injuries, said police Lt. Steven Oshefski. It was unclear what spooked the elephant, but the pachyderm was calmed by those on the scene. The victim is not being identified until next-of-kin have been notified, Oshefski said. The incident was classified as a workplace accident and the investigation has been turned over to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. A balloon vendor at the circus told CNN affiliate WBRE that the death was shocking. ""In the 30 years I've been doing my vending, I've never heard an animal killing their trainer and all,"" said Ed Conrad. ""So something must have happened."" Oshefski said the elephant came into contact with electrical wires, but it was unclear what exactly startled the animal. Animal rights activists decried the use of animals in circuses. ""It should come as no surprise that elephants and other animals sometimes snap and attack circus employees and members of the public,"" said Robbyn Brooks of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). ""PETA has obtained shocking photos and video of circus trainers as they beat elephants and subject them to violent training methods using barbaric devices such as bullhooks,"" Brooks said. Circus members observed a moment of silence for the elephant handler who died, WBRE reported. The circus, however, made a decision almost immediately after the death that the performance would go on.","Startled elephant stomps trainer at circus, killing him, authorities say .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Songs that didn't make the cut on Michael Jackson albums while he was alive and some forgotten recordings left behind on computer hard drives will be on an album released this fall, sources familiar with the project say. Jackie Jackson, one of the singer's older brothers, has been working in a studio to help prepare the album, which will include 10 previously unheard songs, according to Jackson estate spokesman Jim Bates. Jackson's estate and Sony Music announced in March that his next album of unreleased music will go on sale in November. Music producer Rodney Jerkins, who co-produced Jackson's 2001 album ""Invincible,"" has been working with Sony to put together the new album, a source familiar with the project said. The source asked not to be identified because he was not authorized by the record label to disclose details. John McClain, one of the two men named in Jackson's will to be executors of his estate, is also working on the album with Jackie Jackson, Bates said. McClain owns a recording studio in Hollywood. Jackson was known to rent out Los Angeles recording studios for weeks at a time for creative sessions, sometimes alone and sometimes with other well-known artists. A producer told CNN that he was surprised to find a large cache of forgotten Michael Jackson music files stored on a hard drive at a Hollywood studio in the months after Jackson's June 25, 2009, death. When he turned the recording device on to start a session, he heard Jackson singing ""Hot Fun in the Summertime."" The 1969 hit by Sly & the Family Stone is part of an extensive music catalogue that Jackson bought. The producer said he made a backup copy of the 40 gigabytes of Jackson music and turned it over to one of the Jackson estate administrators. He asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. Another computer hard drive with music was found in Jackson's rented mansion in the days after his death, Bates said. A Jackson family member later handed the hard drive over to the estate administrators, he said. It was not clear if any of that music will be included in the upcoming project, but Sony's Columbia Records has a contract with Jackson's estate for 10 albums of unreleased material over the next seven years.","Dozens of Jackson songs were found on hard drives after his death .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- He got a standing ovation before the orchestra even played a single note. Gustavo Dudamel has been compared to the legendary Leonard Bernstein by one critic. For weeks now, anticipation has been growing for the arrival of fiery young Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel to take over the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the crowd couldn't wait to roar its approval at his arrival. Dudamel, 28, engenders a passion among music lovers that is entirely new to the world of classical music. Tickets for his Saturday debut as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic disappeared within minutes -- the fastest sellout in the history of the 18,000-seat Hollywood Bowl. ""He is a phenomenon,"" said Mark Swed, Los Angeles Times music critic. ""He generates excitement the likes of which hasn't come around in a very, very long time -- maybe since Leonard Bernstein.""  Watch the exciting Dudamel wield the baton ¬ª . Swed was in the audience two years ago when Dudamel conducted the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, delivering a reading of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony that left fans delirious. ""I haven't seen that kind of reaction from a crowd since I saw the Beatles at Dodger Stadium,"" Swed said. Dudamel's face has been a common sight for months in Los Angeles. His billboards look down on freeway commuters. He adorns city buses. At the famous Hollywood hot dog stand Pink's, there is even a dog named in his honor -- the ""Dude Dog,"" piled high with jalapeno peppers, guacamole and tortilla chips. While it's not exactly Venezuelan cuisine, in Los Angeles, there can be no surer sign that the conductor known as ""The Dude"" has arrived. So where did Dudamel get this musical magic? He said at least a part of his talent is inherited. ""I started studying music when I was 4,"" he said. ""I wanted to play trombone like my father."" Soon young Gustavo entered into El Sistema, Venezuela's state-financed music education program. Hundreds of thousands of children have received instruments and music instruction through the nation's massive system of youth orchestras. ""You cannot imagine,"" said Dudamel, ""how it changes the life of a kid if you put a violin or a cello or a flute [in his hand]. You feel you have your world. You have your life there, and it changes your life. This happened to me."" As music director of the philharmonic, Dudamel said he hopes to spread a little of the El Sistema magic in Los Angeles. He already has organized one youth orchestra in the run-down neighborhoods of south Los Angeles. Those music students opened for the orchestra at the Hollywood Bowl. The concert also featured student musicians playing alongside jazz legend Herbie Hancock. Cuban pianist Alfredo Rodriguez and bluesman Taj Mahal rounded out an eclectic bill designed to pull in a broad cross-section of music lovers. But it was Dudamel and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony that brought the crowd to its feet at the concert's end. It was a promising beginning for a man many are hailing as the savior of classical music. They hope Dudamel can bring a whole new audience to symphonic music, and believe the Los Angeles Philharmonic is the perfect podium for the young maestro. ""He fits in with this town in a lot of ways,"" Swed said. ""Obviously being Spanish-speaking in a city where the majority of people either speak Spanish or understand some Spanish ... you know he fits in. The youth culture? He is young. He is also great, which doesn't hurt.""","Gustavo Dudamel, known as ""The Dude,"" brings Beatles-like frenzy to Los Angeles .

"(CNN) -- My job as an imam and outreach director for the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center, located minutes from the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol, was created September 11, 2001, to convey a more accurate image of the American Muslim community and to create opportunities for interfaith cooperation and understanding distinct from the stereotypical image of Muslims as intolerant and violent religious anti-American extremists. On the morning of the 9/11 attack, while I was calling my patients from the waiting room at Howard University Hospital, I saw the plumes of smoke in the distance coming from the Pentagon, and on the TV monitor watched the twin towers of the World Trade Center being destroyed. I had been volunteering as the Muslim chaplain and imam at Howard University at that time, and the media began calling me for interviews. By 2002, the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center asked me to be their first outreach director. I left my work as a biomedical researcher, working on my doctorate studying sickle cell disease, and took up this work. Much like the tradition of the black church, I believe I was ""called"" to this ministry to bring people back together, to try to heal a lot of the pain, fear and anger that persisted. The work I do in the greater Washington area is similar to what Daisy Khan and Imam Faisul [Feisal Abdul Rauf] want to do with the Cordoba Initiative at Park51, which is being referred to as the ""Ground Zero mosque."" I know how important this work is, since I do it every day, reaching out to Christian, Jewish and other faith groups as well as colleges, universities, government and the media in order to find common ground and understanding. In March of this year, a group protested my leading an opening prayer for the Virginia General Assembly.  I called the delegate who was responsible for the official invitation -- Adam Ebbin, who is white, Jewish, male and gay. He said he looked at the work I had been doing for almost a decade, and said ""I will stand by you."" That was a teachable moment. Later, members of the House of Delegates said this was one of the most impressive prayers they had heard, and that they were convinced they were hearing from the type of Muslim that we need in America. The struggle for equal access, for the right to build mosques in America -- not just in lower Manhattan -- is reminiscent of the pain and struggle of black Americans for churches, housing, employment and, actually, public acceptance. By the letter of the law, blacks had the right to live or work anywhere, but they were often segregated to certain areas and specific jobs.  Similarly, American Muslims have the right to worship anywhere, but some Americans say we're not ready yet for mosques being built in certain areas. Some years ago I preached in the Holy Land to 70,000 Palestinians at the ""Jerusalem Festival.""  I wondered why they invited me.  As I saw their communities and felt a reminiscent pain of being a second-class citizen in my country, then I knew why God made me a black American at this time: to share my hope and faith. I told them the Quran teaches,""O you who believe! Stand out firmly as a witness before God; and let not the enmity and hatred by others allow you to depart from justice. Be just: that is closer to piety; and fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do."" [Al Maaidah 5: 8] . I realized then that as an heir through the civil rights and black power movements, and now as a Muslim, I am building a bridge from one faith tradition and civil rights movement to another faith and new civil rights movement -- from the fight for civil rights for black Americans, to the fight to secure the right for American Muslims to overcome and live beyond the ""terrorist"" stigma in a post-9/11 world, to make a better America for everybody. The spiritual says, ""I come too far from where I started from, nobody told me the road would be easy."" Establishing Park51 is another step on the road to equality for all people. It must succeed for all of us. These Muslims who respect America want to continue to pray, live and work in their community in lower Manhattan. While honoring our fallen citizens, we must continue to uphold the banner of freedom -- not guilt by association. Although I thrive off the passion of Malcolm X, I engage in struggle with the compassion of Dr. King. ""We shall overcome"" once again.  America eventually gets it right. That America will once again choose the road toward freedom, justice and equality for all people, and that is the America that I believe in. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Imam Johari Abdul-Malik.","Imam Johari Abdul-Malik is director of outreach for a Washington Islamic Center .

"Washington (CNN) -- On the 47th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington on Saturday, the first sight on the National Mall for thousands of marchers was a four-story art installation that displayed four images and quotations of Martin Luther King Jr.. The participants in Glenn Beck's ""Restoring Honor"" rally paused as they walked toward the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial. Some stopped to have pictures taken with King as the backdrop. As recordings of King's booming baritone filled the air, some of the Beck followers laughed and others booed. Some looked for someone to argue their case that King's dream was pass√©, no more relevant to today's politics than the race to the moon. Michael Murphy, an artist from Georgia, created a four-story structure that celebrates King to honor King's spirit and to counter the rallies by Beck and the Rev. Al Sharpton. Four images, each with passages from King's speeches, can be viewed from different perspectives. Rev. Jim Wallis, speaking at a celebration of King's life near the temporary art installation, acknowledged the ""angry discussions about the legacy of this man."" A Beck marcher ran up to someone admiring the art and called out: ""We'll be free again -- in November."" America's political atmosphere at the time of the Beck and Sharpton rallies sometimes seems more toxic than the politics of 1963. Beck has likened the policies of President Obama's administration to those of Adolf Hitler and calls him a communist. Some in the Tea Party movement have questioned Obama's patriotism and insinuated that he is an al Qaeda sympathizer. In fact, the political climate surrounding King's 1963 march was tougher. But King and the civil rights movement provided a moral vision that made it possible for the U.S. to find a way out of those ugly times. The summer of 1963 produced as much conflict as almost any other year in American history. After King's Birmingham, Alabama, campaign, more than 2,000 demonstrations broke out across the nation. More than 50,000 people were jailed. Many protests got violent. NAACP leader Medgar Evers was assassinated in Mississippi. Protesters in Danville, Virginia, got pummeled within an inch of their lives, then subjected to persecution. The governor of Maryland declared martial law in Cambridge. That summer, the civil rights campaigners moved north. Protests in New York, Philadelphia, Newark, Chicago and San Francisco took a dramatic turn toward incivility. Frustrated by years of inattention, renters in Philly dumped mountains of garbage in front of slumlords' suburban homes. Malcolm X sneered at Jews. ""You haven't got no time to cry no tears for no Jews,"" he called out at the Harlem Unity Rally. ""Why, they only killed 6 million Jews."" Meanwhile, segregationists were pushing constitutional amendments to overturn the principle of ""one man, one vote,"" to give state judges power over the Supreme Court and to give states the power to amend the Constitution without any federal involvement. George Wallace and Ross Barnett led an effort to throw the 1964 presidential election into the House so that Dixie could determine the next president. Radical groups of all stripes wanted to use the March to make history. The Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan vowed to round up 10,000 or more white supremacists with the hope of inciting a conflict that would doom the civil rights cause. Segregationists in Congress even expressed hope that violence would ruin the march and the civil rights movement. Leftists, meanwhile, threatened to occupy the offices of segregationists on Capitol Hill and vent their anger at the White House and Justice Department. The Black Muslims denounced ""the Farce on Washington,"" and Malcolm X came to razz the marchers. And on the edges of the movement, Communists tried to work their way into the march. But amid what Garry Wills called America's second Civil War, the civil rights movement embraced the idea that the best way to gain rights was to appeal to everyone's hearts and meet ""physical force with soul force,"" as King put it. King himself did not always understand the imperative of love or nonviolence. As a young man, he later acknowledged, he hated whites. And he did not understand nonviolence right away either. In the early days of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, he hired men to guard his house with guns. By the time of the March, King understood that America could be changed only by winning over the other side. King understood that fighting violence with violence created only more violence. He knew that, whatever happened, blacks and whites needed to live together. One marcher who ""won"" a train ticket to the March on Washington for his courageous conduct in demonstrations, later remembered the time racist thugs threw beer mugs at marchers in Charleston. His first reaction, Harvey Jones told me, was to stiffen up to be ready for a fight. King planted himself in front of Jones. ""If you don't think you can respond nonviolently, maybe you should leave the march,"" King said. He calmed down. King's cause was moral, universal. He sought nothing for his people that other people did not enjoy. He wanted access to lunch counters and bus stations, the right to vote, equal access to schools, protection against mobs, fair police treatment. And King was willing -- and insisted that his followers be willing -- to suffer for the cause. Everyone remembers King's speech at the March for four words: ""I have a dream."" And, in fact, those words were transcendent. They conjured up images of a better world. Those words connected the ordinary struggles of the movement -- brutally hard work rewarded with beatings and jail -- with the glorious possibilities of equality. But even more important were four other words: ""Unearned suffering is redemptive."" King warned that even the most innocent and decent people would continue to suffer. Oppressors never yield power willingly. They fight back viciously. So buck up. Move ahead, first into the swinging batons and electric cattle prods and water cannons. Because there is no other way. King could issue that challenge. He could be that blunt and honest because of the universal values he espoused. They were not fighting for an earmark or a tax cut, loopholes from an EPA regulations, a Department of Education grant or a Fannie Mae subsidy. They were fighting for their lives. It all seems so clear now, but it wasn't back in 1963, not for most people anyway. But the existence of this massive movement, with hundreds of thousands of ordinary people willing to put their bodies on the line with nonviolence and even love, created real light in what could have been the darkest of times. Who's our King? Who is drawing on the power of soul force? Who is appealing to his bitterest enemies? Who today is pointing to a new age of cooperation and brotherhood? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Euchner.","People arriving for the Glenn Beck rally were greeted by a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr.

"Watsonville, California (CNN) -- Sitting at the kitchen table in his small house, Steven Butler has trouble even with a very simple question. He cannot tell you the day of the week or the month, and he has to have the help of a calendar to tell you the year. ""Once a moment is gone, it's gone,"" said his brother and caregiver, David Butler says in an interview to air on tonight's ""Campbell Brown"". ""He can't remember any good times, birthday parties, Christmas, any event."" On October 7, 2006, Steven Butler, by his own admission, was drunk and disorderly. He refused an order from a police officer in his hometown to get off a city bus. The officer used his Taser ECD (officially, an ""Electronic Control Device"") three times. According to doctors, Butler suffered immediate cardiac arrest. He was revived by emergency medical technicians who happened to be close by, but his attorneys say his brain was deprived of oxygen for as long as 18 minutes. He is now permanently disabled. Butler and his family have filed a lawsuit -- not against the police, but against the maker of the weapon, Taser International. John Burton, a lawyer based in Pasadena, California, says he can prove that when the weapons are fired directly over the chest, they can cause and have caused cardiac arrest. In addition, Burton says he can prove Taser knew about that danger. ""Well, we can prove that by early 2006,"" said Burton, ""but we suspect they had all the necessary data since 2005, since they were funding the study."" The study Burton mentions was published in early 2006 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation. Funded by Taser, it focused on pigs struck by Tasers, with the conclusions, according to the study, ""generalized to humans."" The authors wrote that being hit by a Taser is unlikely to cause cardiac arrest, but nevertheless recommended Taser darts not be fired near the heart to ""greatly reduce any concern for induction of ventricular arrhythmias."" Dr. Douglas Zipes, a cardiologist based outside Indianapolis, Indiana, plans to testify against Taser in any lawsuit regarding what happened to Butler. In plain English, he says, that recommendation is a clear warning. ""I think Taser has been disingenuous and certainly up to 2006 -- the case we are talking about -- Taser said in their educational materials that there was no cardiac risk whatsoever,"" Zipes said. ""That Taser could not produce a heart problem, that there was no long lasting effect from Taser."" Medical experts say that if a person is hit by a Taser dart near the chest, one result is a dramatic increase in the subject's heartbeat -- from a resting 72 beats a minute to as many as 220 beats a minute for a short period of time. In its court filings, the company says the ""peak-loaded"" voltage from a Taser at impact ranges up to 40,000 volts but it's a 600-volt average for the duration of the firing. In an e-mail, a spokesman for Taser said the company would not comment on any ongoing litigation. But in a court filing seeking to dismiss the Butler lawsuit, it said Taser devices ""are repeatedly proven safe through testing, in human volunteers, in controlled, medically approved studies."" There's no evidence, the company says, that being hit with a Taser causes cardiac arrest in humans. But the company has significantly changed its recommendations for how Tasers should be used. Officers, it said, should no longer aim for the chest when using the device, instead targeting the arms, legs, buttocks. Why the change? A company document said ""the answer has less to do with safety and more to do with effective risk management for law enforcement agencies."" In other words, say lawyers who have sued Taser, it means police are less likely to be sued if they avoid hitting subjects in the chest. In court papers, Taser says the risk of cardiac arrest is ""extremely rare and would be rounded to near zero,"" but it adds: ""However, law enforcement is left defending a lawsuit and disproving a negative, which is difficult to do."" ""Out of one side of their mouth, they publish this warning, saying, 'Don't hit people in the chest if you can avoid it,'"" said Dana Scruggs, an attorney representing Steven Butler. ""And on the other side, in the lawsuit and in their public statements, they deny that their device can affect the human heart."" Nearly every big-city police department in the United States uses a Taser device. According to the company, more than 14,000 law enforcement agencies worldwide employ Tasers and more than 1.8 million people have had the weapon used on them since it was introduced into general law enforcement use in the 1990s. The human rights organization Amnesty International estimates more than 400 people have died as a result of Taser strikes. Officially, it's not a gun. As an electronic control device, Tasers are not classified as a firearm. The devices are regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. ""There's one thing that's undeniable -- that if I use my firearm, the chances are that you will suffer extreme injuries or death,"" said George Gascon, the newly installed police chief in San Francisco, California. ""The chances are much greater of reducing injuries with a Taser."" San Francisco is one of three big-city police departments in the United States that don't use Tasers (The others are Detroit, Michigan, and Memphis, Tennessee). Gascon wants to change that. He supports use of the device but says to call it ""nonlethal"" is inaccurate. ""We have referred to the Tasers for many years as a less-lethal weapon,"" he said. ""In the San Francisco experience, which we have to concentrate on, I have not said once that this is a nonlethal device because I believe it can be a contributing factor in causing death."" Taser International is growing. Its latest earnings report says the firm made more than $100 million in profits last year by selling Tasers to both law enforcement and to individual consumers. And the company says even more police and sheriff's departments are lining up to purchase the weapon every day. The company argues in Steven Butler's case that simply being in a stressful situation with police can bring on heart problems, and there's no link between being being hit with a Taser and the cardiac arrest. For Steven Butler, greeting the mailman now is a highlight of his day. He doesn't dispute that he was drunk and disorderly when the officer tried to get him off the bus, but he and his family blame Taser for what happened to him. He says he's not frustrated or angry, just resigned to spending the rest of his life trying to remember what happened. After CNN first reported this story, Taser International, which had previously declined all comment, sent us what it called a ""fact sheet"" about the Steven Butler case. The company said the 2006 Taser study CNN quoted produced no cardiac arrests in animals. While the company says cardiac arrests in people are rare, Taser insists it does not claim a ""zero"" possibility of cardiac arrest. Taser also claimed Steven Butler had a pre-existing heart condition and that his blood alcohol level made him vulnerable to cardiac arrest. Butler's medical and legal teams told CNN he had no documented heart problems., and alcohol levels played no role in his cardiac arrest.","Man claims Taser brought on cardiac arrest that starved his brain of oxygen .
