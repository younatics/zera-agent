"(CNN) -- Costa Rica elected its first female president, as the ruling National Liberation Party claimed a historic victory. ""I want to thank the pioneering women who years ago opened the doors of politics in Costa Rica,"" Laura Chinchilla said Sunday to flag-waving supporters in the capital, San Jose. ""My government will be open to all Costa Ricans of good faith."" Second-place candidate Otton Solis of the Citizen's Action Party had conceded defeat earlier in the evening, as the PLN -- the Spanish acronym for the National Liberation Party party -- forged its way to a nearly 2-to-1 lead. Polls showed Chinchilla garnering 46.8 percent of the vote, with 84 percent of election sites reporting. Solis had 25.1 percent, while Otto Guevara of the Libertarian Movement had 20.9 percent. Election day was festive throughout the nation, with video footage showing supporters of the main presidential candidates dressed in their respective campaign colors. International observers interviewed on CNN affiliate Teletica compared the election scene to a festival. The festivities included election sites where children could vote in a mock presidential vote. The educational outreach let the children pick their candidate on a digital ballot not unlike the ones the rest of the electorate cast their votes with. Some 2.8 million Costa Ricans are eligible to vote. In addition to voting for president, Costa Ricans cast ballots for two vice presidents, 57 Congress members and 495 council members. The legacy of outgoing President Oscar Arias -- a Nobel laureate who leaves office a popular, if polarizing, leader -- has in many ways shaped the presidential race. Although he has given Costa Rica a larger role in foreign affairs through his involvement in seeking resolution to the political crisis in Honduras, but his style has rubbed some the wrong way. After casting his vote Sunday, Arias called the electoral process transparent and trustworthy. ""I would like to thank the Costa Rican people for filling the streets with color,"" he said. CNN's Roberto Pazos contributed to this report.","NEW: Chinchilla takes 46.8 percent of the vote, with most election sites reporting .

"(CNN)  -- Two sheriff's deputies responding to a domestic dispute between a pair of brothers Monday night were shot and badly injured in the same Washington county where four officers were killed last month, authorities said. The Pierce County deputies were wounded while responding to a domestic violence incident at home near the town of Eatonville, south of Seattle, said Hunter George, a county spokesman. They killed the gunman, identified as David E. Crable, in an exchange of fire, authorities said. Sgt. Nick Hausner, 43, a 20-year veteran of the Pierce County Sheriff's Department, was transported to Madigan Army Medical Center where he was in serious condition, the department said. He is married and has children who are 14 and 12 years old. Deputy Kent Mundell, 44, a nine-year veteran, was airlifted to the trauma center at Harborview Medical Center where he was in critical condition with life-threatening injuries, the sheriff's department said. He also is married and has two children, a 16-year-old and a 10-year-old. Pierce County prosecutor Mark Lindquist said Crable had a history of protection orders sought by family members. Earlier this year, Crable pleaded guilty to malicious mischief and brandishing a knife in an incident involving his brother, Lindquist said, and protection orders were imposed afterward, telling him to stay away from his brother and a female minor. Both counts were misdemeanors. Lindquist said Crable had no felony convictions. The protective orders were not in effect during the Monday night shooting, Lindquist said. The prosecutor said other protection orders that emerged were not the result of charges filed. ""They are a result of people saying this guy is a danger to me,"" Lindquist said. ""I think you can reasonably infer from his history, he had an alcohol problem."" Crable went to his brother's house Monday night and there was a domestic dispute, said Sheriff's detective Ed Troyer. One of the men invited the officers inside the house, while the other man went upstairs. He returned with a weapon and shot at the deputies, striking them several times, Troyer said. Local coverage from CNN affiliate KIRO . The deputies returned fire, killing the alleged shooter, he said. ""There were a lot of rounds fired,"" Troyer said. Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire issued a statement saying, ""My thoughts and prayers are with the two wounded Pierce County deputies, their families, friends, and the entire law enforcement community."" This incident comes in the aftermath of two other recent cop shootings in the Seattle area. Since October 31, eight police officers or deputies have been shot. Five have died in the attacks. On Halloween night, Seattle police Officer Timothy Brenton was fatally shot while sitting in his patrol car. Brenton, 39, was reviewing paperwork from a traffic stop when someone fired into his patrol car. An officer Brenton was training was wounded in the shooting. A suspect in that case was arrested and pleaded not guilty. On November 29, four officers from Lakewood, Washington, were killed in an ambush-style shooting at a coffee shop. Police shot and killed the suspect in that attack after a two-day manhunt. Troyer said it was ""surreal"" to be responding to another shooting that involved officers. His department has led the investigation into the shooting of the four Lakewood officers. ""I am deeply troubled by the recent series of attacks on our law enforcement officers,"" Gregoire said in the statement. ""I ask that all Washington citizens join me in sending a clear message that these assaults on law enforcement officers will not be tolerated. ""The people of Washington and across America know that those who wear a badge show us the true meaning of service. They sacrifice their safety for ours. We owe them and their families our gratitude, respect and support.""

"(CNN) -- No matter the years she has been away and the miles that separate her, Crystal Roles still calls Naoma, West Virginia, home. She left the mining town with her high school sweetheart, soon after they graduated and married in 1989. But every trip back home -- to the area the world has been watching for days -- is a reunion with a special world for the coal miner's daughter. ""It's a breed of people, a group of people that are like nobody else,"" says Roles, 39. ""The same people who are underground now, looking for the four missing, are kids I went to high school with."" Authorities confirmed early Saturday that rescue efforts had came to a grim end after crews found the bodies of four miners who had been missing since the explosion almost a week ago. The death toll from Monday's blast at the Upper Big Branch mine now stands at 29, making it the worst mining disaster in the United States in nearly four decades. Rescue crews going underground, Roles says, may have had ""to step over one of their neighbors, a deacon in their church or someone who recently sat on the front porch with them having a glass of tea."" Since the explosion, outsiders have tuned in to the news from her hometown. But for those who live there or were raised in mining communities, the story will continue long after the media trucks pull away. Grounded in family ties, hard work and pride, it is a story that links generations and binds people together. It is a life driven by harsh economic realities -- the need to have work and support families. It comes with a steep price: Miners hold one of the most dangerous jobs in America. In West Virginia, the average miner brings home $68,000 a year, according to 2007 figures provided by the National Mining Association -- a salary the organization says is 100 percent higher than the average state wage. Because of her deep connection to Naoma, Roles, who now lives in Hickory, North Carolina, has hung on every shred of information she can get. Text messages from cousins came almost immediately Monday evening. And through phone calls to her parents, she knows her 63-year-old father, Benny Crum, is a wreck. See Roles' iReport posting . ""I've cried ever since this happened. My heart is broke,"" Crum, a former miner, said Thursday night. ""Coal miners -- it's like a fraternity. When it comes to one of them getting hurt, we all hurt. You want to go and help."" Forced into retirement 18 years ago, after he said black lung disease made the work impossible, Crum feels there's little he can do. Dependent on oxygen tanks, he listened to his scanner Monday night and watched and worried as others raced to the Upper Big Branch coal mine. Later, from his porch, he looked on as his community formed a candlelight vigil. Being a coal miner was in his blood and all Crum ever wanted to do. The danger of his job, roof bolting -- or supporting the ceilings to keep others safe -- was like a drug that fueled him during 18-hour days. His father began working in the mines at age 12, the day after his own father died on the job. ""My daddy was a miner for 57 years. Most of his life was spent underground,"" Crum said. Among the miners are men who defy the stereotypes held by some outsiders, Crum said. Though they are miners, they are also teachers, ministers, police officers. They're people who are trained and do this work because they are proud to, or because their other career choices haven't paid enough to support their families. Crum said he's seen coal miners quit to head off to medical school. ""They're not doing this because they're too stupid to do anything else,"" he said. ""They're skilled and educated people -- not just a bunch of hicks."" And there's a work ethic that those connected to mining communities say is unmatched. For about nine hours a day, six days a week, Kara Scurlock's husband, Brian, 31, works in a mine not far from Upper Big Branch. If he gets vacation time, she doesn't know it, because he never takes it. Given travel time from their home in Beaver, West Virginia, and down into the mine, he's gone about 12 hours a day. Deep underground, he works beneath a ceiling that stands about 3 feet high. See Kara Scurlock's iReport posting . ""It's cold, it's wet, it's muddy,"" and when these miners come home, ""they're sore, they're tired, they're hunched over all night,"" she said. ""When he [Brian] gets up and walks, you can hear his knees pop. And he stays congested. He's constantly hacking."" But her husband doesn't complain, she says. In his free hours during the day, he fixed up the house he purchased. He took time off from the mines in 2003 after his brother, Rodney, was electrocuted in the same Massey Energy mine the world is watching today, she said. But he went back soon after he and Kara married in 2005. ""It gets in your blood,"" said Scurlock, who is the granddaughter and great-granddaughter of coal miners. ""I would stand behind him, whatever he chooses."" Scurlock worries about her husband but says he shows no fear himself. When he came home Monday night, she grabbed him, held him all night and cried. Every day, when he leaves for work, the process is always the same, she said. ""He just makes sure when he leaves for work he gives me a kiss and tells me he loves me,"" she said. ""And I make him carry a pen and paper in his bucket, so in case something happens, he can write a note."" Country singer Kathy Mattea still feels a deep kinship with miners and their families. Her two grandfathers were miners in West Virginia, where she grew up outside Charleston. One was an organizer in the 1920s and '30s for the United Mine Workers of America. When she heard the news Monday, she said she felt ""an unexplainable grief for people I've never met that's with me all the time."" That feeling, during the Sago Mine disaster in 2006, inspired her 2008 album ""Coal."" Mattea was 9 when an explosion in Farmington, West Virginia, in 1968 killed 78 miners, including an uncle of the state's current governor. She remembers ""the pall over our household, how all the oxygen got sucked out of the place."" That moment is what she always returns to when mine disasters strike. If the recent mine explosion affected you, share your story . She honors her coal mining history and the people still living that life in simple actions. She wishes others would, too. ""When we flip on a light switch, we're part of the story,"" said Mattea, who lives in Nashville, Tennessee. ""It was hot enough yesterday to turn on the AC. And I thought, because I'm doing this, I'm directly linked to what's happening there. It felt different.""","Mine disaster shines spotlight on community steeped in pride, hard work and danger .

"New York (CNN) -- Americans can expect a roaring debate over social issues in the discussion of  the next Supreme Court nominee, but in the end, President Obama's choice to succeed Justice John Paul Stevens is likely to be confirmed, CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says. Toobin, author of ""The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court,"" said the large Democratic majority in the U.S. Senate gives Obama a strong chance of getting his choice confirmed. He says, though, that the ideologically divided court has undergone a lot of turnover in the past five years, and it's impossible to predict how it will evolve. Toobin notes that one thing is fairly clear: Obama will probably begin his search for a new justice with the candidates he did not select when he picked Sonia Sotomayor for the court last year. Toobin spoke with CNN on Friday. Here is an edited transcript. CNN: What do you think is the most significant role that Justice Stevens played on the court? Jeffrey Toobin: As the senior associate justice on the court, he had the second most formal authority to assign the writing of opinions after the chief justice, and he was undoubtedly the leader of the liberal wing and a very successful one. CNN: Now, who will assume that senior associate justice role? Toobin: The senior associate justice role would be Antonin Scalia now, but he votes with Chief Justice [John] Roberts most of the time. So the senior liberal on the court would now be Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is a less outgoing person than Justice Stevens. CNN: Do you expect we'll see a marked change in how the court operates? Toobin: The court doesn't change dramatically in terms of its operations. But as Justice Byron White used to say, ""You change one justice, you change the whole court,"" and I expect that will be true. By Supreme Court standards, the last five years have been a period of enormous turnover. It's not at all clear which side will be ahead when it's all over. CNN: Do you expect that there's any potential the president's nomination could change the complexion of the court? Toobin: I am certain the president will nominate someone who is generally sympathetic with Stevens and Obama's own politics, but history shows it's folly to predict with precision exactly how a justice will evolve over decades. CNN: What do you think are the two or three things that are most important to Obama in making this decision? Toobin: I think the most important criterion is a justice of integrity and intelligence. The second is a justice who shares his general views about law and the Constitution, and third is someone who can get confirmed. CNN: What kind of a justice does he need to nominate in order to get a confirmation that is relatively easy? Toobin: He has 59 Democratic senators, so it's overwhelmingly likely that anyone he nominates will get confirmed. It's important to remember that. By historic standards, this is a very large majority. Yes, it is possible there will be a filibuster, but there has never been a successful filibuster to stop a Supreme Court nominee in the modern era. CNN: And how important is age as a factor in his decision? Toobin: I think age is a huge factor, because one of the big appeals of Supreme Court nominations is that they serve for life, and a 49-year-old nominee will likely serve 10 years more than a 59-year-old nominee. CNN: Of the recent issues that have been before the court and the issues that are coming up, which of them are likely to be raised in the course of the debate over the nomination? Toobin: There are certain evergreens of constitutional conflict that come up, though nominees rarely address them directly. One is abortion, another is affirmative action, but to be sure, there will be questions about gun rights, there will be questions about the constitutionality of health care reform, and there will always be issues that we can't even anticipate. CNN: And do you think this resonates beyond Washington this year? Toobin: I do. When you're talking about the Supreme Court, you're talking about social issues, which many people care very deeply about, so I think this is not just a Beltway issue. CNN: You've said that you're a law school classmate and friend of [Solicitor General] Elena Kagan. What's your view of her? Toobin: I think she is a formidable possible nominee. She seems to meet many of the criteria that Obama has talked about: intelligence, integrity, a consensus-builder, and she was just confirmed by the Senate as solicitor general last year, which is not a guarantee that she would get confirmed but certainly can't hurt. CNN: In her role as a law school dean, she was noted for bringing on conservative scholars? Toobin: That's correct. She was known as a real defender of ideological diversity on the faculty. CNN: Who do you think are the two or three other leading candidates? Toobin: I think presidents generally don't like to reinvent the wheel with their Supreme Court candidates. The finalists before were Kagan, [Judge] Diane Wood of the 7th Circuit and Janet Napolitano, the secretary of Homeland Security. I expect the list will begin with them and may include others. One illustration of how much the country has changed is that Stevens is the only Protestant on the court. It is a court now of six Catholic justices and two Jewish justices, compared to a time when there used to be a Catholic seat and a Jewish seat. CNN: Do you think Obama would be mindful of that in making a selection? Toobin: I think religion now is more of a curiosity than a criterion for nomination. So, yes, he would be aware of it, but I don't think it would make a difference.","Obama will likely begin search for nominee with candidates he didn't pick last time .
Jeffrey Toobin says social issues will be front and center in debate over nominee .
He says Obama's majority in Senate means he will likely get choice confirmed ."
"(CNN) -- A New Jersey teachers union is coming under fire after an internal memo included a veiled threat to Gov. Chris Christie. The leaked memo, which was sent to union leaders in the New Jersey Education Association's Bergen County division, contains a closing paragraph written in the form of a prayer. ""Dear Lord,"" the letter reads. ""This year you have taken away my favorite actor, Patrick Swayze, my favorite actress, Farrah Fawcett, my favorite singer, Michael Jackson, and my favorite salesman, Billy Mays. I just wanted to let you know that Chris Christie is my favorite governor."" Bergen County Education Association President Joe Coppola said the memo was confidential and the line was intended as a joke. ""It was inappropriate, it was in bad taste, and it was definitely in poor judgment,"" Coppola said. But Christie is not taking the letter lightly and had some strong words for the teachers union. ""We can have honest disagreements about policy,"" the governor said at a news conference Friday. ""But I am sure there are teachers all across New Jersey when they learn about this today who are going to be ashamed."" He added, ""I wonder what the children of New Jersey will think when the leadership of the teachers union is praying for their governor to die."" The incident comes as Christie and the New Jersey Education Association are entrenched in a bitter struggle over funding for New Jersey's school system. Seeking to address an $11 billion budget deficit, Christie, a Republican who was elected in November, has proposed severe cuts to the state's education system, with teachers being hit especially hard. Barbara Keshishian, president of the New Jersey Education Association, issued an apology Friday condemning the letter. ""Language such as that has no place in civil discourse,"" she said. ""Our ongoing discussion with Gov. Christie is centered on serious issues of significant importance to the state, and that must be the focus of all our conversation.""","Internal memo asks God to take New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie .

"(Mental Floss) -- Most people limit their gambling to March Madness pools or the occasional trip to Vegas. Celebrities, of course, tend to do everything on a grander scale. Let's take a look at some famous people and the high-profile bets on which they cashed in or lost big. 1. Truman defeats Dewey, Jimmy the Greek defeats Vegas . Everyone remembers the ""Dewey Defeats Truman"" headline from the 1948 presidential election, but Harry Truman wasn't the only big winner that night. Legendary gambler Jimmy the Greek had bet $10,000 on Truman at steep 17:1 odds. His logic? His research showed that female voters weren't too keen on candidates with facial hair, which didn't bode well for the mustachioed Dewey. 2. Phil Mickelson has a nice 2001 . PGA golfer Phil Mickelson had a hot hand during 2001. Fans might remember that two longshots won titles that year: the Baltimore Ravens won the Super Bowl, and the Arizona Diamondbacks knocked off the New York Yankees in a classic World Series. Mickelson was part of betting groups that had picked both squads. Their $20,000 bet on the 28-to-1 Ravens yielded a cool $560,000, and they hit again with $20K on the 38-to-1 Diamondbacks. And to think people used to say Mickelson couldn't get a big win. 3. Getting into the White House is tougher than free throws . Last July, NBA star Shaquille O'Neal and a member of his entourage had a fiery debate about whether or not Shaq could just drop by the White House unannounced and be welcomed with open arms. After much back-and-forth, Shaq decided he'd give it a try. If he couldn't get past the gate, he would do 1,000 pushups. If he made it inside, his buddy would have to do the pushups. Unfortunately for Shaq, even the Big Aristotle needs an appointment to see the President. When O'Neal walked up to the gate, the Secret Service politely but firmly turned him away. He later told the Washington Post's Dan Steinberg that he was working off his debt in increments of 20 to 30 pushups. Mental Floss: Great photos found in presidential libraries . 4. Paul Ehrlich's population bomb doesn't go off . Even celebrity scientists have tried their hands at high profile gambling. Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich is famous for his grim predictions concerning overpopulation; he famously predicted in 1968 that 20 percent of the world's population would starve to death before 1985. As you might expect, these claims were somewhat controversial. When Ehrlich commented in 1980 that he would make an even money bet that England would not exist in the year 2000, economist Julian L. Simon had heard enough. Simon decided to book an unusual bet of his own with Ehrlich. Since Ehrlich's underlying Malthusian argument involved the depletion of natural resources, Simon made this challenge: Ehrlich could name whatever natural resource he wanted, buy $1,000 worth of it, and pick a time frame. If at the end of the time frame the commodities were worth more than the initial $1,000, Simon would pay Ehrlich the difference. If they were worth less than $1,000, Ehrlich would fork the difference over to Simon. If Ehrlich's predictions about dwindling natural resources came to pass, the prices of commodities would skyrocket and Simon would be out a lot of cash. Ehrlich was game. He spread his $1,000 evenly among chrome, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten and told Simon to wait 10 years. Although the world's population shot up by 800 million people in the intervening decade, the metals' prices crashed. When the bet ended in 1990, Ehrlich had to cut Simon a check for $576.07. 5. Ringo says don't bet on a Beatles reunion . By 1974, legions of fans were clamoring for a Beatles reunion, but Ringo Starr was having none of it. The drummer told London reporters that he had bet a thousand pounds that the Beatles wouldn't play together that year, and that he would be happy to throw a thousand quid down on the group never playing together again. Mental Floss: 9 things you might not know about the Beatles . 6. Arnold Palmer bets on romance . When golfing legend Arnold Palmer met his wife, Winnie, he had a problem that a lot of young guys run into: he couldn't afford an engagement ring. He was still an amateur golfer at the time, and he was barely scraping by on his meager income. Eventually, he borrowed money from a group of pals to cover the rock. Palmer wasn't crazy about having this sort of debt, so when the same group of buddies proposed a trip to New Jersey's Pine Valley Gold Club, he jumped on the chance to chisel away at his obligations. When they hit the links, Palmer offered the boys this bet: he would get $100 for every stroke he finished under 70. If he played poorly on the notoriously tough course, he would shell out $100 for every stroke he finished over 80. Although he bogeyed the first hole, Palmer repeatedly used this system along with a variety of side bets to wriggle out from under $5,000 in debt in a single weekend. 7. Hollywood ads add up . In 1999, Dreamworks' ""Saving Private Ryan"" was locked in a duel with Miramax's ""Shakespeare in Love"" for the Academy Award for Best Picture, which set the stage for an unusual bet. Dreamworks honcho Jeffrey Katzenberg bet actor Warren Beatty that his rival Miramax would run more ads hyping its film than Dreamworks would. The stakes: a $10,000 donation to the charity of the winner's choice. Beatty won the wager when Dreamworks took out 165 pages of ads versus Miramax's 118, and Katzenberg paid up. Mental Floss: Where 10 Oscar winners keep their statues . 8. Computers are no match for chess master . In 1968, Scottish chess champion David Levy attended a conference on artificial intelligence and discussed the future prospects for chess-playing computers. Although Levy was optimistic about the future of chess-playing computers, he thought developing great AI would take a while. After some debate, he bet four professors 1,250 British pounds that nobody would make a computer that could beat him within the next 10 years. Although it took a while for chess programs to pose a serious threat to him, Levy ended up winning the bet when he defeated the program Chess 4.7 in a six-game match at the 1978 deadline. The man-vs.-machine showdown was such a big deal that even Sports Illustrated covered it. After his win, Levy put up another $1,000 as a bounty for the first chess program that could beat him in a four- or six-game match. He eventually fell in 1989 to Deep Thought, a precursor to famed chess computer Deep Blue. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN) -- The junta leading Niger following last week's coup and suspension of the constitution is working to return the country to democratic rule, a United Nations official said Sunday. ""The political party is very keen to return power to civilians and transition to an all-inclusive democracy,"" U.N. Special Representative for West Africa Said Djinnit told CNN. ""This transition began with the occurrence of the coup and the expiration of the constitution and implementation of a new constitution."" The new constitution already is in the works, said Djinnit, who along with representatives from the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States met with junta leaders in Niamey, Niger, on Sunday to push for a quick resolution to the conflict. ""The mission of this meeting is to assure this coup is the last,"" Djinnit said. ""No coup can be tolerated."" President Mamadou Tandja is said to be detained in a military camp following Thursday's coup. Soldiers reportedly stormed the presidential palace, according to the United Nations, and the French Embassy reported hearing intermittent gunfire less than a mile from the palace. A military official announced the suspension of the constitution later that day and attributed the order to the Superior Council for the Restoration of Democracy. The violence may have been prompted by a collapse of talks between the government and the opposition over a recent referendum allowing the president to hold power indefinitely, according to the United Nations. Tandja had been in office since 1999, but Niger's previous constitution mandated only two, five-year terms for president, according to the CIA World Fact Book. General public sentiment in the west African nation of 15 million appeared to favor the coup, according to Djinnit, who said life had returned to normal for civilians and many had gathered in rallies of support. Djinnit's observations back earlier reports that the situation was calm in Niger, with children returning to school and shops open for business. CNN's Andreena Narayan contributed to this report.","General public sentiment in Niger appears to favor last week's coup, U.N. official says .

"CNN caught up with Italian midfield legend Andrea Pirlo who gave us his insight into the World Cup holders and made his predictions for this summer's tournament in South Africa. Describe Italy's coach Marcello Lippi: . He is serious but just when you have to work or when he has to deal with the press. With the players he is able to joke around and create a good atmosphere. He is a delightful person and a great coach. Are Italy too old to win the World Cup again? There are so many players with experience, I would say we are experienced, not old. And considering we have played together at the highest level for a long time we can go far at the World Cup. Who impressed you the most during qualifying? Spain and Germany -- Spain are the team that has been playing better. They are amongst the favorites. Who can be the surprise package? I like the Ivory Coast. They did not play particularly well at the Africa Cup of Nations but they are full of talent. Who is the most passionate player? [Gennaro] Gattuso, who shows his passion in the way he plays and for sure also [Gianluigi] Buffon and [Fabio] Cannavarro. Who plays the most practical jokes? Me, [Daniele] De Rossi and Gattuso. There's enough understanding between veterans to do that. Who is the most vain guy on the team? [Gianluca] Zambrotta is that kind of guy. He uses a lot of cream and gels. He would like to be always perfect but he is not able to be! And who is the last one on the bus? That is easy [Mauro] Camoranesi -- if there is someone missing on the bus, in the briefings it is always the same guy -- Camoranesi.","Pirlo believes Spain have the best chance of lifting the World Cup this summer .

"London, England (CNN) -- The former vice president of Bosnia was arrested Monday in London on a request from Serbia, where he is wanted for conspiracy to murder and breach of the Geneva Convention. Metropolitan police arrested Ejup Ganic at Heathrow Airport on Monday afternoon, and he appeared at the City of Westminster Magistrates' Court, the United Kingdom Foreign Office said in a news release. The British authorities were awaiting the full extradition paperwork before a court date for an extradition hearing can be set, the Foreign Office said. Citing the ongoing case, authorities declined to comment further. Ganic was the vice president of Bosnia during the bloody civil war there between 1992 and 1995, and he was twice president of the Bosnian-Croat Federation in the years after the Dayton peace agreement in 1995. Ganic was regarded by many independent commentators at the time as a relative moderate in the war-time Bosnian leadership. An engineer by profession, Ganic studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States. He would regularly brief journalists during the three-year civil war from his often-shelled office in the Bosnian presidency building in the heart of Sarajevo. On Sunday, Bosnia and Serbia signed an agreement on extraditions for war crimes committed during the war that would let Bosnians be tried in Bosnia and Serbs in Serbia. Ganic was in Britain attending a graduation ceremony at the University of Buckingham, which partners with a university in Sarajevo in which Ganic is reported to have a significant financial interest. CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","Ejup Ganic wanted in Serbia on charges of conspiracy to murder .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Former Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari has won a non-binding vote that could influence the decision on who will be the country's next prime minister, an official in the office of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr said Wednesday. Tens of thousands took part in the vote last week in tents set up on the streets of Baghdad and some some southern provinces. The vote was called by al-Sadr, who has refused to back the top vote-getters in the March 7 election and wanted his followers to designate a prime minister of their choosing. Al-Jaafari won 24 percent of the votes in last week's balloting, the official in al-Sadr's office said. Current Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki won 10 percent, and former interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi won 9 percent, the official said. Allawi aims to quickly form Iraqi government . The results play no official role in deciding who governs Iraq, but it means al-Jaafari will be the person that the al-Sadr bloc is committed to supporting as the next prime minister. March's election produced extremely close election results and the final outcome is still uncertain. Allawi's Iraqiya bloc won 91 seats, a razor-thin victory over al-Maliki's State of the Law coalition, which gained 89 seats, according to the provisional results. At least 163 seats are needed to form a government. As a result of being at the top of the balloting, both Allawi and al-Maliki are working to form coalition governments and are reaching out to entities like al-Sadr's group. Al-Sadr's party, which gained at least 39 seats in the voting, is a member of the Iraqi National Alliance, the Shiite bloc that received 70 seats. CNN's Yousif Bassil contributed to this report.","Unofficial vote called by radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Ten years ago, teen Daniel Giddings shot a man during an attempted robbery and was sentenced to six to 12 years in prison. During his time behind bars, Giddings racked up almost 30 disciplinary infractions, was kicked out of two separate facilities for bad behavior and reportedly spent hundreds of days in the hole because of his conduct. After serving 10 years, Giddings was released last August. According to CNN affiliate WPVI, he allegedly assaulted several police officers days later. Then, in September, he allegedly killed a Philadelphia police officer before being fatally shot by another officer. We see classic cases of repeat offenders like this all the time. A teen is thrown into the abyss of the corrections system and comes back out no better, if not worse. If we had the right intervention for troubled teens, could we reduce their chances of becoming repeat offenders? The fact that we constantly have to ask that question tells me America needs to change the way it fights crime. As a nation, we're very good at locking criminals up, yet we still remain one of the most violent and crime-ridden societies in the developed world. According to the International Center for Prison Studies in London, England, the United States has the world's highest incarceration rate, with one in 100 adults behind bars. In fact, the United States accounts for less than five percent of the world's population, but almost a quarter of the world's prisoners. Considering how much time, energy and money we spend locking people up, you'd expect to see a bigger payoff. But in the United States there are about 16,000 homicides per year, or roughly six per 100,000 people, based on Department of Justice statistics. Compare that to Canada and Britain, which don't even tally 1,000 homicides per year each. Our current system is broken because it is too focused on tossing criminals behind bars and hoping they get the message instead of rehabilitating them. I'm not saying we need to stop punishing criminals. We just need to start peppering in prevention techniques and using creative solutions to identify red flags early. Quietly, the pendulum is swinging in that direction. Missouri's groundbreaking juvenile justice system is the vanguard. It focuses on rehabilitation, therapeutic intervention and conflict resolution rather than force and punishment. Small groups of youths stay in dorms with a couple of adult facilitators to emphasize individual treatment. According to Harvard University's Ash Institute, the youths attend daily meetings with peers, partake in educational and volunteer programs and serve as role models for each other. This approach appears to be bearing dividends, as the Department of Justice points out over 90 percent of Missouri youths avoid further incarceration for at least three years after graduating from the program. Thanks in part to these detention alternatives, Missouri's adult prison population decreased from 2005 to 2007 after increasing each year from 1997 to 2003, according to the Missouri Department of Corrections. Other states are catching on to the Missouri model. The Annie E. Casey Foundation, a leading supporter of alternative juvenile justice, says there are more than 100 sites using juvenile detention alternatives in 24 states and the District of Columbia. The proliferation of these alternatives may be having nationwide effects. The national juvenile arrest rate has decreased nearly 10 percent from 2000 to 2007, according to FBI arrest statistics. Obviously the Missouri model isn't the only factor at play, but imagine the impact if we could spread those programs to the other 26 states. So how will we get the remaining ""tough against crime"" politicians to implement similar systems? By showing them how it will fatten up the government's coffers. The Missouri model has been shown to reduce recidivism, meaning states will have fewer repeat offenders to incarcerate. And the best way to reduce prison costs is to reduce incarceration. I think certain aspects of the Missouri model must be expanded beyond corrections systems. After all, why should juvenile offenders be the only ones learning conflict resolution and peer counseling? We should offer similar tools -- such as group therapy -- in public high schools to help all troubled kids before a potential descent into criminality. In these school-based programs, no topic should be off limits. Alcohol, drugs, sex, money -- whatever is bothering these children, they should have a place to share experiences, learn to cope with adversity and simply have someone willing to listen. Such a program would also enable children to discuss issues that they are unwilling or unable to share with their parents. As a recovering alcoholic, I know how powerful and effective therapeutic programs are. They help you dissect a problem and uncover its cause. Therapy helps millions of people with a variety of issues, yet most kids aren't exposed to these incredible tools when they need it most (unless they have rich parents to pay for therapy sessions). It is very promising to see that America is moving toward a balance of punishment and prevention, thanks to inventive ideas like the Missouri model. No matter how many prisons we build and criminals we lock up, the fact remains the best way to fight crime is to stop it at the source. And that is exactly what these creative solutions aim to do. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jane Velez-Mitchell.","Jane Velez-Mitchell: Locking up teen offenders won't solve problem of repeat crimes .

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court in Argentina has ruled that a grandmother must stand trial for growing two marijuana plants in her backyard. Argentina allows personal consumption of marijuana, and a federal judge had issued a stay against prosecuting the unnamed woman, who swore she used the marijuana solely for herself, the government's Judicial Information Center said last week. But the public prosecutor's office appealed the ruling, and a federal appeals court overturned the previous decision because the woman lives with her two sons and a grandchild. She could not prove the marijuana was solely for personal consumption, the three-page appeals court ruling said. Argentina's Supreme Court ruled in August it is unconstitutional to punish an adult for private use of marijuana -- as long as the use doesn't harm anyone else. The unanimous ruling made Argentina the second Latin American country within a one-week span last year to allow personal use of a formerly illegal drug. Mexico also enacted a law in August that decriminalized possession of small quantities of most drugs, including marijuana, heroin, cocaine and LSD. Earlier last year, a Brazilian appeals court ruled possession of drugs for personal use is not illegal.","Grandmother in Argentina will have to stand trial for growing two marijuana plants, court says .

"Paris, France (CNN)  -- The widow of former Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana, whose assassination sparked the 1994 genocide, was arrested Tuesday in Paris on a Rwandan warrant, French and Rwandan officials said. Agathe Habyarimana was arrested at her French home Tuesday morning and is scheduled to appear in court later in the day, said a deputy prosecutor who declined to give his name because he is not authorized to speak about the matter. Rwandan Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo told CNN that Habyarimana was arrested on genocide charges. They include genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, complicity to commit genocide, and direct and public incitement to commit genocide, said John Bosco Mutangana, the head of Rwanda's Genocide Fugitives Tracking Unit. The charges also cover crimes against humanity, specifically murder and extermination; creation of a criminal gang, namely the Hutu militias; and aiding and abetting the killings perpetrated by soldiers in violation of the Geneva Convention, Mutangana told CNN. ""We have of course strong evidence linking her to the genocide and the planning of the genocide itself, as early as the early 1990s,"" Mutangana said. Former president was killed in April 1994 when his plane was shot down near the capital, Kigali. The mass killings began hours later, and by the time they ended 100 days later, some 800,000 people had been killed. Most were members of the country's Tutsi minority, killed by members of the Hutu majority. The circumstances surrounding Habyarimana's death remain a mystery. He was a Hutu, and speculation immediately fell on Tutsis as the perpetrators of the attack -- but some have also speculated that Hutus themselves shot down the plane to provide cover for the genocide. Top officials such as army generals and politicians who allegedly took part in the genocide have been tried in the Rwandan justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal, which is based in Tanzania. Civilians who allegedly contributed either directly or indirectly are tried by local communities in ""gacaca"" courts, which allow survivors to confront their attackers. Some human rights organizations have criticized the gacaca courts for falling short on delivering justice. Agathe Habyarimana is now under temporary arrest, the French deputy prosecutor said. The Court of Appeal in Paris must now decide whether to remand her into custody or place her under judicial control at her home, he said. After that, the French court must decide on the validity of the Rwandan warrant before any decision on extradition can be made, the deputy prosecutor said. Rwandan officials began working on Agathe Habyarimana's case in 1995, but it took a while before they could gather enough evidence to indict her, Mutangana said. They submitted the indictment last October, he said. Mutangana said Rwanda is hoping France will extradite her. ""We are the first beneficiaries of justice, the Rwandans,"" he said. CNN's Alix Bayle in Paris, France, and Melissa Gray in London, England, contributed to this report.","Agathe Habyarimana was arrested at her French home Tuesday morning .

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- At least three men died from their wounds Wednesday after they were shot in a confrontation with Ugandan security forces at a destroyed historic site, the Ugandan government said. The men were part of a group of Buganda tribe members who rushed to the site of the Tombs of the Buganda Kings which was destroyed by fire Tuesday night. Exactly how many people were wounded remained unclear despite the government statement. While the government statement listed three dead and five wounded, the Ugandan Red Cross said it had ferried 23 injured people from the site to a Mulago hospital, 11 of them with bullet wounds. ""There several other cases, whose number I can not establish, who were either carried away by their relative or friends after sustaining bullet wounds. Others were stampeded on as they ran,"" said Uganda Red Cross official Susan Kabwe, who was at the tombs site. The tomb site is a UNESCO-listed cultural site of major significance to the country's largest tribe. It was not clear what started the fire at the Tombs of the Buganda Kings, which was built in 1882 and lies near the capital, Kampala. It contained the tombs of four ancient kings of the Buganda people along with cultural relics, including the spears of past kings. Tensions between the Buganda and the government have historically run high, in part because President Yoweri Museveni is not from the tribe. There have been claims Museveni favors his own people, a tribe in the west, and the Buganda have said they feel persecuted. Both the central government and the tribe began separate investigations of the fire Wednesday. ""We saw a huge fire popping out of the tombs as it rained,"" said Jowelia Lunkuse, 49, who operates a kiosk at the edge of the site. ""The flames kept increasing high in the air and we had to close and ran away, fearing it would spread to burn us."" Museveni visited the site Wednesday morning. King Ronald Mutebi arrived moments after Museveni left, along with Medard Ssegona, the Buganda kingdom's information minister. Are you in Uganda? Share your view on the situation . ""We are getting all sorts of testimonies from our people whom we will use in our independent investigations, but we do not rule out acts of foul play from our enemies,"" Ssegona said. A tense atmosphere gripped Kampala hours later, with angry people lining the streets and armed soldiers on patrol. The tombs were on a hilltop around the former Buganda palace, built in 1882 and converted into the royal burial ground in 1884, according to UNESCO. The main building was low and circular, topped by a high conical dome. UNESCO called the building ""a major example of an architectural achievement in organic materials, principally wood, thatch, reed, wattle and daub. The site's main significance lies, however, in its intangible values of belief, spirituality, continuity and identity."" The tombs are where the reigning king, or kabaka, frequently carried out important rituals related to the Ganda culture, the largest ethnic group in the land-locked East African country. The tombs were built in the ""finest traditions"" of local architecture and palace design, UNESCO said. The palace with its tombs ""reflects technical achievements developed over many centuries,"" the organization said. ""It is a major spiritual center for the Buganda and is the most active religious place in the kingdom."" ""The UNESCO World Heritage Centre expresses its dismay for this tragic event that devastated the site and its related symbolic values,"" the group said in a statement. ""UNESCO is ready to mobilize international experts to help the Ugandan authorities in assessing the damage and envisaging remedial actions. ""The Tombs of Buganda Kings at Kasubi were inscribed on the World Heritage List in 2001 and were recognized as a masterpiece of human creativity both in their conception and execution, bearing eloquent witness to the living cultural traditions of the Buganda."" Buganda kings have always built their palaces on strategic hills to control the major roads to the palace and find easy ways to escape in case of an invasion or rebellion. When they died, the traditional practice was to bury each king at a separate site to establish a royal shrine for his jaw bone, which was believed to contain his spirit. These shrines were staffed by descendants of the kings' leading chiefs, his widows, his ritual half-sister, and a medium through which the dead king was said to communicate with his successors. Many of the shrines are still maintained today. Journalist Katherine Haywood and Samson Ntale contributed to this report.","Tombs of the Buganda Kings in Uganda destroyed by fire Tuesday night .

"(CNN) -- Heavy fighting flared in the Somali capital Thursday, a day after a battle between government forces and Al-Shabaab rebels left 29 dead and scores injured. At least 80 people were wounded in the fighting, which started Wednesday morning and continued all day, according to government and medical officials. Most of it occurred in the north of Mogadishu, where a majority of militants allied with Al-Shabaab are believed to be in control, authorities said. Three foreign rebels, including Algerian commander Abu Mu'sab Aljaza'iri, were killed in the fighting, government radio reported on its Web site. ""Continuous shelling has shaken the whole city,"" said Yusuf Mohamed Abukar, a local journalist with Shabelle Radio. A heavy shell fell in Jungal neighborhood in the northern part of Mogadishu, killing 13 people and wounding another 13, according to Abukar, who witnessed the fighting. Ali Muse Sheikh, head of a local ambulance, said his group transported at least 65 injured civilians to different hospitals. The state defense minister claimed victory in Wednesday's fighting and said the Al-Shabaab suffered heavy loses. Government forces have detained Al-Shabaab prisoners, said Yusuf Mohamed Siad Indho ade, the minister. ""We have Al-Shabaab prisoners from yesterday's fighting and most of them are minor children who have been brainwashed by the group,"" he added. Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda proxy in the country, was declared a terrorist organization by the United States. It's waging a war against Somalia's government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia. Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, and fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated the humanitarian crisis in the famine-ravaged country.","Fighting continues in Somali capital day after 29 killed in clashes .

"(CNN) -- Actress Angelina Jolie says she feels passionate about Haiti, whose ""extraordinary"" people are inspiring her with their resilience after the devastating earthquake one month ago. During a visit to Haiti this week, she said that despite the terrible tragedy, Haitians are dignified and calm. Jolie, a good will ambassador for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said of the Haitians, ""They're very inventive people, they're very strong people, and they're finding ways to help themselves."" ""I think we have a moral duty to do what we can for any country that's suffering,"" she told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview from Port-au-Prince. ""I think we have a very big obligation to the place. ... I'll continue to come back and I'll continue to express what I am learning."" Jolie expressed particular concern about the fate of Haiti's children -- the amputees, the homeless and the orphans -- and worried about the risk of child trafficking. Haiti earthquake: Numbers tell the story . ""Trafficking has been a huge problem for a very long time ... so I think everybody that means well needs to really take that very seriously, and not get frustrated, but really work with the country,"" she said. ""And for myself, as somebody who is an adoptive parent, I understand the urge to assist in that way, but now is not the time. An emergency is not the time for new adoptions anyway."" Pressed on whether she might consider adopting a Haitian child, Jolie told Amanpour, ""I'm always open to children around the world. We're that kind of family. Brad [Pitt] and I talk about that. ""But that's not what we're focusing on at this time, by any means. We're not here for that. We're here to see how we can help protect the children in the country and scale up the needs here."" Jolie said it is vital to reunite families that have been torn apart by the disaster and set up a system to register survivors. ""We don't know who is an orphan. I've met [Haitian] women in the Dominican Republic in hospitals who were saying they haven't spoken to their children,"" she said. ""They have no cell phones, they have no way to tell their children they're alive. They can't find them yet."" She also was worried about children who lost limbs in the earthquake. ""You see little kids that have lost their legs and you ask them if they are all right and they say they're OK, and somehow they are able to smile. ... I think [that] says a lot about them."" Jolie said it's vital for the world to provide sufficient housing for survivors -- housing that is strong enough to stand up to hurricanes. ""We saw a large amount of tents, new tents, but that's not necessarily going to be the answer because they've got this much bigger problem in how to find proper shelter to survive hurricanes,"" she said. Last fall, hundreds of people died in flooding and landslides as two large hurricanes and a tropical storm hit the nation. Jolie said the scale of the disaster is nothing like she's seen before. ""The complexity of this before and now, and the history of this country, is something that I am still trying to wrap my head around. And it's going to be a very, very difficult road.""","Actress Angelina Jolie visits Haiti as good will ambassador for U.N.

"(CNN) -- Somalia's main militant group has banned the United Nations food agency and ordered its aid workers to leave the impoverished country. Al-Shabaab released a statement to the media Sunday, accusing the World Food Programme of distributing expired food and undermining local farmers, said Peter Smerdon, a WFP spokesman. Smerdon declined to comment on the accusations, but said the agency is committed to the failed nation in the Horn of Africa. ""WFP is determined to help the people of Somalia in need of assistance, regardless of who controls the areas in which they live, as long as it is safe for our staff to do so,"" Smerdon said. About half the population -- or nearly four million Somalis -- is starving, according to the United Nations. The food aid agency suspended work in southern Somalia in January, saying rising attacks and unacceptable demands from armed groups had made it impossible to work in the region. Smerdon declined to say whether the agency had resumed operations in the south. However, a statement on the WFP Web site says it continues to deliver food to other parts of the country, including the volatile capital, Mogadishu. Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda proxy in the country, controls much of southern Somalia. It has accused the food aid agency of having a political motive and supporting the U.N.-backed transitional government. WFP has denied the allegations and said it is impartial and nonpolitical. Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, and fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated the humanitarian crisis in the famine-ravaged country.","Al-Shabaab accuses World Food Programme of distributing expired food .

"Editor's note: Raquel Cepeda is an award-winning journalist, documentary filmmaker and former editor of Russell Simmons' Oneworld magazine. Cepeda wrote and directed the feature documentary, ""Bling: A Planet Rock,"" about hip-hop's obsession with diamonds and its effect on the decade-long conflict in Sierra Leone. Cepeda is based in New York, where she was born to Dominican parents. Find her at http://djalirancher.com/blog/. Raquel Cepeda says people don't fit into the neat categories outlined by the U.S. Census. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Let's all pretend to be the astrologer Walter Mercado for a moment. Say we predict that the Obama administration's master plan to engage people of Latino/Hispanic/Spanish origin proves to be effective. Let's say that along with strategic partners Telemundo and the Census Bureau, they somehow manage to corral the millions of ""Latinos"" into filling out the 2010 census forms in April. Say the idea of plot-kneading the message into an already half-baked yet inexplicably popular telenovela, ""Mas Sabe el Diablo,"" wins over the hearts and minds of ""Latinos"" everywhere. But what's a Latino? While we all may speak a version of our Spanish colonizer's language, contrary to popular belief, we're not all Mexican. Yes, the majority of Latinos in America are of Mexican descent, but we also hail from other countries around the world. Take the ethnically ambiguous 15 percent of us who descend from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Cuba. An overwhelming majority of us aren't solely of Spanish, black or native origin: We're all of the above and then some (some of our ancestors migrated from Asian, Middle Eastern and an array of European countries). With the 2010 census upon us, the time is now for the fastest-growing minority group in the country to define themselves for themselves and at the same time clear up the cultural confusion surrounding our identity. But how can we, given the perplexing racial categories on the census, coupled with our own complex identity issues, paint an accurate picture of who and how complex we are, not just what we are? Take me, for example; I'm a first-generation American, the product of Dominican parents whose short-lived relationship could have rivaled that of Shakespeare's own telenovela, Romeo and Juliet. My family is made up of a rainbow coalition of racial chameleons. Recently, I was told that my maternal grandmother's own abuela was Vietnamese; my maternal great-great-grandfather was Haitian; somewhere on my paternal side, we're supposedly Sephardic. As in many Dominican families in my New York neighborhood -- Washington Heights -- with ties to the motherland, blackness is rarely discussed. When I traveled to Sierra Leone and Ghana, I was asked if I was Moroccan, Lebanese or Eritrean. In Paris, if I was Brazilian or Arabic. In fact, I've been singled out a couple of times when entering and leaving Brazil, and was once accused of having a fake American passport by an agent. Being mistaken for everything but a person of Dominican heritage has certainly piqued my desire to examine how I and other Latinos fit into our national and global communities. When I learned that nearly eighty percent of Puerto Rico's 4 million colorful residents checked off the ""white"" racial box on the last census, I wasn't floored -- given the alternatives. Race in the Caribbean lies in the eye of the beholder. And the beholder, from centuries of colonization, has more often than not been socialized to reject their blackness despite our collective and direct relationship to slavery. An association with a historically discriminated ethnic group like African-Americans somehow drives the idea that the American dream is out of reach. In the American media, people with darker complexions are often grossly stereotyped. And Spanish language television often depicts people with darker skin and so-called African features as shiftless, ignorant and at the bottom of the social barrel. This sort exposure, along with other factors, will result in a Latino with dark skin to be inclined to check off ""white,"" especially if their only other choices were ""African-American"" instead of, say ""Black/Brown,"" and ""Native American"" rather than the more familiar ""Indio/Taino."" And then there's the pesky ""Hispanic/Latino/Spanish"" issue. I posed a few questions about the racial categories within the census to my Latino followers on Twitter. Off the bat, people found that lumping Spanish-speaking origins together was misleading. @TheJLV, self-described as half Dominican, wrote that there are ""definitely misnomers unless you're strictly from Spain or have acknowledged Spanish ancestry."" Many used ""Latino"" and ""Hispanic"" interchangeably, unsure about the differences, but rejected Spanish altogether because not doing so would be the same as an American calling themselves ""English."" Younger generations of American-born Latinos are challenging the census' categories, like 25-year-old @deevazquez, whose parents are Dominican and Puerto Rican-American: ""Having Afro-Caribbean roots, I don't feel like any of those labels really represent my culture and historical background."" Others, turned off by the overgeneralizations, are opting out altogether. If anything encouraging results in Latino census participation, aside from enhancing your state's chances of receiving a chunk of the allocated $400 billion in federal funds, it may be a growing desire within the Latino-American community to ask questions. Many responders have expressed interest in exploring their roots through genealogical DNA testing. I've often wondered where my Dominican ancestors originally came from, as have others in my community. Said one responder, ""Not only do I look at myself and feel like I look different in every picture or mirror, but I also look at my family and wonder where certain features come from,"" she states, ""and what it all mean[s]."" Many of us want to know. Maybe in the future, the Census Bureau may want to borrow from a survey conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics in 1976 and ask Latinos to classify themselves. Through self-definition, the population presented 134 terms to describe race. Though it's uncertain that Latino-Americans will come close to topping Brazil's exhaustive list of ethnic categories, the results will certainly encourage all Americans to start thinking outside the box when it comes to their perceptions of race. One thing is certain: Christopher Columbus and his pirates of the Caribbean did their best to not only conquer the land but also, through slavery and miscegenation, to literally change the face of the New World.

"(CNN) -- The managing director of the Abu Dhabi Investment Fund is missing after his glider plane crashed into a lake in Morocco, the state news agency of the United Arab Emirates reported Friday. Authorities were searching for Sheikh Ahmed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who is a brother of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the UAE, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Sheikh Ahmed is also chairman of the board of trustees of the Zayed Foundation for Charity and Humanitarian Works, said WAM, the news agency. The plane went down in the northwestern city of Skhirat, according to Morocco's official news agency, MAP. Forbes' 2009 rankings of ""The World's Most Powerful People"" rated the missing sheikh at No. 27. The pilot was rescued in good condition, WAM said. A spokesman for the fund did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The sovereign-wealth fund, which was established in 1976, is owned by the government of Abu Dhabi. In an interview in January with Germany's business daily newspaper Handelsblatt, Sheikh Ahmed said he preferred not to use the sovereign-wealth fund label to describe the investment fund. ""We prefer to be seen simply as a globally diversified investment institution, with the difference being that our owner is the government of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi,"" he said. ""ADIA's sole mission, which has not changed in over 30 years, is to secure and maintain the current and future welfare of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi."" Asked about news reports that ADIA's global assets range between $300 billion and $800 billion, Sheikh Ahmed hewed to the secretive style that has marked the fund. ""As a matter of policy, ADIA does not disclose its assets under management,"" he said. But he noted that his brother, the president, who is also ADIA's chairman, ""has stated publicly that some of the highest estimates seen in the media have been exaggerated.""","Search under way for Abu Dhabi executive Sheikh Ahmed after Morocco plane crash .

Pleva stood up and tried to defuse the situation. ""I'm sorry; do I know you?"" Pleva asked. ""I don't care if you know me or not,"" Mackalonis answered. ""Do not say this town is racist."" ""I didn't say that,"" Pleva said. ""Don't speak for anyone else,"" demanded Mackalonis. ""I promise you, I don't,"" Pleva said. The exchange went on for minutes. It was highly unusual to have a formal interview interrupted in that way. But, the emotion of that moment typified the anxiety that gripped Shenandoah, a down-and-out former coal town in central Pennsylvania.  Mackalonis interrupts CNN interview » . On July 12, 2008, a group of white high school students, out on the prowl after a night of drinking, encountered one of their female classmates in the company of Luis Ramirez, a 25-year-old migrant worker from Mexico. Racial insults were exchanged, and, in no time, a fight ensued. Police reports claim that at least one kick was delivered to Ramirez's head while he was unconscious on the ground. He died two days later. One of the boys was charged as a juvenile. Another teen pleaded guilty to federal civil rights violations in a plea deal. The other two teens were charged with ethnic intimidation but were ultimately acquitted of those charges. The crime cast an unwelcome spotlight on Shenandoah, according to Mackalonis. ""It's putting Shenandoah on the map for being a rotten town. It's not a rotten town,"" Mackalonis said. ""I talk to people, and it's, 'Oh, yeah, you're from Shenandoah, where that illegal immigrant got beat.' "" Shenandoah has a rich cultural history. In its heyday, during the productive coal mining years of the 1920s, the town boasted nearly 30,000 residents. St. George's Roman Catholic Church became the nation's first Lithuanian parish. St. Michael's became the first Greek Catholic church in the country. There were so many diverse immigrant groups that the town was dubbed ""Little New York."" When the coal mines dried up in the 1950s, Shenandoah began its economic slide. Today, the town's population is just over 5,000. But immigrants still come to Shenandoah. The latest influx has been Latinos, who account for less than 10 percent of the town's population. It's inexpensive to rent or buy a house here, and most immigrants are able to send money home. Although some in town accept the new residents, many of them from Mexico, others feel threatened by those who are here illegally. One person said that when he hears Spanish spoken, he ""feels out of place. Like you're not in America no more."" Luis Ramirez was one of those illegal immigrants from Mexico. His death divided the town. One group wanted a long prison term for the boys. Another side called it ""a street fight gone bad"" and claimed that the boys acted in self-defense. Still others felt a degree of ambiguity and uncertainty as they waited for the trial to sort things out. But Mackalonis, a local bartender, had made up her mind. ""Get your story straight before you go babbling anything,"" she admonished Pleva. ""If he wasn't here illegally, I think it wouldn't have happened."" Getting the story straight in Shenandoah proved difficult. Mackalonis herself gave three possible scenarios for the crime: the rape of a 14-year-old, a drug deal gone bad and a fight that started spontaneously. In our dozen trips to Shenandoah, we heard many more rumors of gangs, violence and drug dealing by Latinos. They were hard to substantiate, and fear seemed to rule the day. Both Latinos and white residents told us they were afraid to walk the streets at night, even though we saw little evidence of any major crimes. Residents talk about crime, racial overtones . After her tirade during our interview with Pleva, Mackalonis stormed across the street to her home. We caught up with her to learn more about her opinion of undocumented workers. ""If you're here legally, fine. But if you're here illegally, and you don't want any of these problems, go back, get the green card, come back,"" Mackalonis said. But one resident said many people in Shenandoah think every Latino needs a green card. Carlos Ramos, who was born in Puerto Rico, is an American citizen. Despite that, he is often asked for his green card. ""If you're Puerto Rican or Dominican or whatever, you know, to them you're considered a Mexican,"" Ramos said. Pleva tries to understand such differences. She has been outspoken in her attempts to help Shenandoah heal. She spoke at a candlelight vigil just days after Ramirez's death, urging racial harmony. All of which leaves her confused about Mackalonis. ""It hurts. We live across the street. We don't know each other. I just now found out her name when she told it to you! And yet she has all of this animosity toward me,"" Pleva said after the confrontation. It has been months since our surprise interruption. In that time, the residents of Shenandoah have put the murder trial behind them. But little has changed. Some high school students see the convicted boys as heroes. Undocumented workers still find jobs around town. Rumor, distrust and disinformation fill the air, and anger simmers just below the surface.

"London, England (CNN) -- The value of shares in a British company drilling for oil off the Falkand islands halved Monday, after it revealed the existing supply may not be commercially viable. In a statement on its Web site, Desire Petroleum said ""oil may be present in thin intervals but that reservoir quality is poor."" Desire will release the final results of its 30-day test drilling operation in the South Atlantic archipelago on Wednesday. According to the company it may have to drill deeper to find greater quantities of oil and gas. Desire estimated that the North Falkland Basin could contain 3.5 billion barrels of oil as well as having ""significant gas potential."" But potential revenues from oil and gas reignited a long-running dispute between London and Buenos Aires over ownership of the Falklands. Last month, Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner signed a decree requiring all ships navigating from Argentina to the islands to carry a government permit. The Falklands, known as Las Malvinas in Argentina, lie in the South Atlantic Ocean off the Argentinean coast and have been under British rule since 1833. Argentina has always claimed sovereignty over the islands and invaded them in 1982, prompting a war in which more than 600 Argentinean and 255 British military personnel died. The island's government, representing a population of around 2,500, remains committed to British sovereignty and the UK maintains a military presence on the islands. The Argentine position is that natural resources around the islands should be protected, and Britain must accept international resolutions labeling the Falklands a disputed area. ""This has to do with the defense of the interests of Argentineans, not just about sovereignty,"" Argentine Cabinet Chief Anibal Fernandez said in February, adding that Argentina lays claim not just to the islands, but to any resources that could be found there.","Desire: ""Oil may be present in thin intervals but reservoir quality is poor""

"Washington (CNN) -- The State Department condemned Iran's persecution of religious minorities on Friday following the Iranian authorities' detention of Baha'is and Christians in recent months. Iranian authorities have detained more than 45 Baha'is in the last four months, and as many as 60 Baha'is are imprisoned in Iran on the basis of their religion beliefs, the State Department said. Iranians have also recently detained more than a dozen Christians, according to the State Department. ""The United States is increasingly concerned about the Iran's ongoing persecution of Baha'is and other religious minority communities,"" said Philip J. Crowley, assistant secretary for public affairs, in a statement on Friday. The State Department's condemnation comes a day after it released a human rights report on Iran that blasted the country's government for abusing religious minorities, among other criticisms. ""Government rhetoric and actions created a threatening atmosphere for nearly all non-Shia religious groups, most notably for Baha'is, as well as for Sunni Muslims, evangelical Christians, and members of the Jewish community,"" Thursday's report said. Iran is an Islamic Republic where Shia Islam is the state religion. The Iranian government did not respond directly to the State Department on Thursday or Friday. However, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad criticized the West on Friday for ignoring religious principles like monotheism. At a meeting with Iranian intellectuals, ""the president stressed that [many] efforts should be made to ... promote justice and support [a] campaign against oppressors and help monotheism flourish,"" Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency reported. Thursday's State Department report said that Iran's government prevents Baha'is from gathering in homes to worship and bans Baha'is from public schools, universities, the social pension system and government leadership posts unless they conceal their faith. ""The government repeatedly pressured Baha'is to recant their religious beliefs in exchange for relief from mistreatment,"" the report said. All seven members of Iran's Baha'i national leadership body, who were arrested in 2008, remained in prison at the end of 2009, according to the report. The Baha'i faith was founded in Iran in the 19th century. Today, Baha'is are the country's largest religious minority, with 300,000 members, according to the official Baha'i Web site. Thursday's State Department report also accused the Iranian government of destroying a Sufi library and religious hall in Isfahan; demolishing several Sunni mosques; and requiring evangelical Christian groups to submit congregation membership lists to the government. The report was part of a broader State Department release of human rights reports on 194 countries.","State Department concerned over Iran's ongoing persecution of Baha'is, Christians .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- In a move likely to further strain relations between the United States and Israel, the municipality of Jerusalem has given final approval for a controversial Israeli housing project in the heart of a Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem. Approval of the project paves the way for construction of 20 apartments being developed by American millionaire Irving Moskowitz on land that he purchased in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. Moskowitz, an avid supporter of Jewish building in East Jerusalem, purchased the land in 1985. To make way for the new housing units the historic Shepherd Hotel which was built in the 1930s by a prominent Palestinian family would be torn down. The Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in East Jerusalem has become an area highly coveted by Jewish nationalists wishing to cement Jewish claims to the land, and it has become a fault line in the public debate about Israeli building in Arab areas of East Jerusalem. Every week hundreds of Palestinians, Israelis, and international activists stage protests in the neighborhood to protest Israeli government building policies. East Jerusalem was captured from Jordan in the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Israel claims sovereignty over all of Jerusalem, though this it is a claim not recognized by the international community. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capitol of their future state. In a terse statement Wednesday, the Jerusalem Municipality argued the East Jerusalem construction was actually approved in July 2009 and that the owners of the land merely paid a necessary fee last week which generated an automatic approval for the project to proceed. ""This is distorted media information in order to create a provocation during the Prime Minister's visit to the United States"" read the statement. The building plan, which was given municipal approval last summer, was met with great disapproval from the United States which demanded that it be stopped. It was a demand, then as now, that fell on deaf ears. At the time Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet, ""Our sovereignty over [Jerusalem] cannot be challenged. This means that residents of Jerusalem may purchase apartments in all parts of the city. We cannot accept the idea that Jews will not have the right to live and purchase in all parts of Jerusalem."" Netanyahu echoed the same arguments in defense of the Israeli announcement two weeks ago to build 1,600 units of housing in a different East Jerusalem neighborhood. That announcement, made while U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden was visiting Israel, set off a diplomatic rift between the United States and Israel that both sides are still attempting to iron out. U.S. President Barack Obama and Netanyahu met Wednesday evening in Washington to discuss Israel's plans for new housing units in East Jerusalem. The leaders did not appear before cameras, and there was no sign of an end to the dispute. Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for the Palestinian Authority, called the approval ""an intentional insult to the U.S. administration"" and works against ""any serious indirect or direct negotiations"" between Israel and the Palestinians. Rudeineh said the Obama administration ""should put enough pressure on Israel to implement what has been written and issued by the Quartet in Moscow several days ago."" On Friday, the Middle East Quartet, the United States, European Union, the United Nations, and Russia, called on both sides ""to refrain from proactive actions"" and for Israel to freeze all settlement activity in an effort to promote peace talks.","Controversial Israeli housing project approved in Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- More than 160 people have been arrested in connection with the massacre earlier this month of scores of people in central Nigeria, a national police spokesman told CNN Monday. Of the 163 arrested, 41 will be charged with homicide, said spokesman Emmanuel Ojukwu. The other 122 will be charged with rioting, arson and possession of firearms, he said. More than 200 people died in the March 7 massacre,  according to some estimates. They took place in predominately Christian towns near the city of Jos, where about 150 people, mostly Muslims, were reported killed in January. The region lies on a faith-based fault line between Muslim-dominated northern Nigeria and the mainly Christian south. Ojukwu said the ethnic backgrounds of those arrested are mixed, but they are all from the area near Jos. Human Rights Watch said the attacks by Muslims with guns, machetes and knives apparently were in retaliation for the previous attacks against Islamic communities and the theft of cattle from herdsmen. Last week, at least 11 more people were killed in a predominantly Christian village. Choji Gyang, special adviser on religious affairs to the governor of the Nigerian state of Plateau, has said the attackers were Muslim herdsmen, some dressed in military uniforms. They also stole about 120 cattle from the village, he said. The violence has put much of oil-rich Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, on edge. Authorities in Lagos took the unusual step of sending a text message to residents earlier this month to try to put them at ease. The violence often pits Christians and Muslims against each other. But John Onaiyekan, Roman Catholic archbishop of Abuja, Nigeria, and former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo have said that the violence is fueled more by other factors: ethnic, social and economic problems. ""If you have one group or a community that has land that's been encroached upon by another community or even by itinerant cattle farmers, then the people who lay claim to the land will fight back,"" Obasanjo recently told CNN. ""If there are job opportunities in an area, and persons believe they are indigenous to that area, and (are) not getting enough out of the jobs that are available, they will fight those who are getting the jobs.""","More than 200 people were slain on March 7 in mostly Christian towns .

"CRAWFORD, Texas (CNN) -- Anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan doesn't come around President Bush's ranch any more, but there's a new kid in town trying to get his attention. Peace activist Alix Bryan traveled 11,000 miles to President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas. Peace activist Alix Bryan, 33, arrived near the ranch here on Saturday afternoon aboard a motor scooter that goes about 55 miles per hour -- on 12-inch wheels. She drove the scooter from the White House to a home in Crawford dubbed by anti-war activists as the ""Peace House,"" mapping out a circuitous route that formed a peace sign. Sheehan used to frequent the house. Bryan bears little resemblance to Sheehan, a California woman who gained national attention as a protest leader after her son Casey was killed fighting in Iraq. Sheehan's loss prompted her to camp near Bush's home in Crawford throughout August 2005, demanding a meeting with the president to discuss her son. Bush refused to see her, and she abandoned her protests in Texas last year. Bryan's odyssey took three months. She journeyed more than 11,000 miles braving elements ranging from rain to wind and even one speeding ticket (which she says she talked her way out of). ( Watch Bryan arrive in Crawford ») ""I had my moments actually where I was just exhausted, I mean it's draining,"" Bryan said upon her arrival in Crawford. ""I've ridden in heat from 105 degrees to temperatures (as low as) 40 degrees."" Bryan blogged about the trip on the Web site of Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, the liberal presidential candidate, and sustained herself with donations to her own site, www.peacescooter.com. Bryan said she always planned to end her trip in Crawford and hoped to arrive on September 15 after hitting the road from the White House in July. But weather delays and running out of gas once delayed her arrival in Texas until this weekend, when Bush happens to be spending time at his ranch. While the odds of landing a meeting with the president are remote at best, Bryan said if she had the chance she would like to start a dialogue of peace based on the conversations she had with Americans along the way. ""I would say even those who voted for Bush do not support this war,"" she said. But the large crowds of antiwar activists that followed Sheehan around Crawford in the summer of 2005 have long since vanished. A ""rally"" at the Peace House to celebrate Bryan's arrival drew just a handful of antiwar activists. Nevertheless, Bryan said she was not defeated.

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Authorities believe assassins targeted a pregnant woman and two other people connected with a U.S. consulate who were killed in drive-by shootings over the weekend, Ciudad Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said Monday. The killings were carried out by a local gang, known as Los Aztecas, that is allied with the Juarez Cartel, Reyes told CNN. No arrests had been made by Monday afternoon. ""We know that the U.S. citizens were targeted,"" Reyes told CNN, saying a police officer saw gunfire from a car directed at the Americans' car. ""We know they were chasing them. We know they wanted to kill them."" Two of the victims were a four-months-pregnant employee of the consulate in Juarez and her U.S. citizen husband who was a jailer in nearby El Paso, Texas, U.S. and Mexican officials said. The couple's 10-month-old child, who was in the vehicle, was not injured, Reyes and other officials said. The child has been turned over to U.S. consular officials, Reyes said. The couple lived in El Paso, the State Department said. The third victim, found dead in a separate vehicle, was identified as the husband of a Mexican employee of the consulate. His wife was not traveling with him, but two of their children in the car were wounded, officials said. All the victims had left a birthday party at the consulate Saturday before they were attacked, Reyes and State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Monday. The slain couple, Arthur Redelfs, 34, and Lesley Ann Enriquez, 35, were on their way home to El Paso, Crowley said. Redelfs was a 10-year veteran of the El Paso County Sheriff's Office, according to Jesse Tovar, a spokesman for the department. Reyes said the attackers may have been confused because both groups of victims were traveling in similar-looking vehicles. Redelfs and his wife were in a white late-model Toyota RAV4 SUV. The third victim, Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, was driving a late-model white Honda Pilot, the mayor said. Salcido, 37, was a state police officer who was married to a Mexican employee at the U.S. consulate, Reyes said. His two children, ages 4 and 7, were wounded and transported to a hospital, the attorney general's office said. Salcido's wife was traveling in another vehicle, which was not attacked, Reyes said. In Washington, President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed their anger. ""The president is deeply saddened and outraged by the news of the brutal murders of three people associated with the United States Consulate General in Ciudad Juarez,"" National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer said in a statement Sunday. ""He extends his condolences to the families and condemns these attacks on consular and diplomatic personnel serving at our foreign missions. In concert with Mexican authorities, we will work tirelessly to bring their killers to justice."" Clinton said the ""safety and security of our personnel and their families in Mexico and at posts around the world is always our highest priority."" ""I have spoken with our ambassador in Mexico, and we are working with the government of Mexico to do everything necessary to protect our people and to ensure that the perpetrators of these horrendous acts are brought to justice,"" she said. In response to the shootings, the U.S. State Department authorized the temporary relocation of employees' families working in border-area consulates. ""These appalling assaults on members of our own State Department family are, sadly, part of a growing tragedy besetting many communities in Mexico,"" Clinton said in a statement Sunday night. ""They underscore the imperative of our continued commitment to work closely with the Government of [Mexican] President [Felipe] Calderon to cripple the influence of trafficking organizations at work in Mexico."" The families of employees at U.S. consulates in Tijuana, Nogales, Ciudad Juarez, Nuevo Laredo, Monterrey and Matamoros are allowed to leave for 30 days ""in response to an increase in violence along the Mexican side of its border with the U.S.,"" State Department spokesman Fred Lash told CNN. The authorization can be renewed after 30 days, depending on a review, Lash said, adding that this was not a mandatory evacuation. The announcement was part of a warning to U.S. citizens regarding travel to Mexico. The warning urges U.S. citizens to delay nonessential travel to parts of the states of Durango, Coahuila and Chihuahua, where Juarez is located, because of ""recent violent attacks."" U.S. government employees are restricted from traveling to all or parts of these three states. Attacks include the kidnapping and killing of two resident U.S. citizens in Chihuahua, the warning states. ""Some recent confrontations between Mexican authorities and drug cartel members have resembled small-unit combat, with cartels employing automatic weapons and grenades,"" the warning says. ""During some of these incidents, U.S. citizens have been trapped and temporarily prevented from leaving the area."" Reyes, who received a death threat last week, said the shootings highlight a problem shared by both countries along their 2,000-mile border. ""It is not just a Mexican problem -- it's is a U.S.-Mexico problem,"" Reyes said. ""I'm very glad that the U.S. has taken that position."" He said that he supported the State Department's authorization to consular families and that ""it is important they feel safe."" Mexico said Sunday that it was committed to protecting all people, citizens and visitors alike, diplomats or not. ""The Mexican government deeply laments the killings of three people linked to the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juarez,"" Mexico's foreign ministry said in a statement. ""The Mexican authorities are working with determination to clear up the facts surrounding the crime scene and put those responsible before the law."" Juarez is one of the front lines in Mexico's war against the drug cartels that operate in its territory. More than 2,600 people were killed in Juarez in 2009. The city has become a focal point of Calderon's anti-drug efforts after the January 31 killings of 15 people there, most of whom were students with no ties to organized crime. The incident sparked outrage across Mexico. But the violence is not restricted to Juarez. In the western state of Guerrero, at least 25 people were killed Saturday, state officials said. The bodies of 14 people, including nine civilians and five police officers, were found in various parts of the resort city of Acapulco, the official Notimex news agency reported, citing Guerrero Public Security Secretary Juan Heriberto Salinas. In the small city of Ajuchitlan del Progreso, 10 civilians and one soldier were killed in two shootouts that started when federal officials tried to execute search warrants at two locations, Salinas said. Police in the state were on a heightened security alert, he said. The government has not released official figures, but national media say 7,600 Mexicans lost their lives in the war on drugs in 2009. Calderon said last year that 6,500 Mexicans died in drug violence in 2008. Unofficial tallies this year say more than 16,000 people have been killed since Calderon declared war on the cartels after assuming office in December 2006.

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- The founder of a Mexican Catholic order sexually abused minor-age seminarians and fathered three children with two women, the religious sect has revealed. The Legion of Christ order and its lay Regnum Christi Movement asked for forgiveness Thursday for ""the reprehensible actions of our founder,"" the Rev. Marcial Maciel. ""We express our sorrow and grief to each and every person damaged by our founder's actions,"" said a communique signed by the Rev. Alvaro Corcuera and 15 other Legion of Christ leaders. The abuse allegations surfaced in 1997. The Vatican started an investigation into Maciel's actions in 2004 and concluded in May 2006 that he was guilty of sexual abuse, the group said. ""We had thought and hoped that the accusations brought against our founder were false and unfounded, since they conflicted with our experience of him personally and his work,"" the order's statement said. As a result of the Vatican investigation, however, officials at the Legion of Christ ""reached sufficient moral certainty to impose serious canonical sanctions related to the accusations made against Maciel, which included the sexual abuse of minor seminarians. Therefore, though it causes us consternation, we have to say that these acts did take place,"" the group said Thursday. Law enforcement officials apparently were not informed. The Vatican, ""mindful of Father Maciel's advanced age and his delicate health, decided to forgo a canonical hearing and ask him to retire to a private life of penance and prayer, giving up any form of public ministry,"" the communique says. Pope Benedict XVI approved the decision. Although leaders at the Legion of Christ knew of the abuse since May 2006, they kept it quiet until this week. As of Friday, Maciel's biography on the order's Web page merely said, ""In May 2006, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith invited Father Maciel to 'a reserved life of prayer and penance, renouncing all public ministry.' "" Maciel died January 30, 2008. Javier Bravo, spokesman for the sect in Mexico and Central America, said Legion leaders did not reveal the accusations sooner because ""it has been a very difficult process. We weren't ready to assimilate it before."" Now, he told CNN en Español, ""we have to recognize the facts as they are."" Legion leaders acknowledged the delay, saying in Thursday's communique, ""It's taken us some time to assimilate these events of his life. For many -- above all the victims -- this time has been too long and painful."" In addition to sexually assaulting young seminarians, Maciel fathered at least three children, Thursday's statement said. The priest had a daughter from a stable relationship with a woman, and two men said they are his children from a relationship with another woman. Maciel, born in March 1920, founded the Legion of Christ in January 1941. According to the order, the Legion of Christ has a presence in 24 countries. The first Legionaries arrived in Spain in 1946, and the order established a center in Rome in 1950. In the 1960s, the Legion established itself in Ireland and the United States. In the 1980s, the order expanded into more countries in South America and Central Europe. The Legion says it recently began pastoral projects in Eastern Europe and Philippines. The announcement about Maciel comes against a deepening crisis in the Catholic church, which is investigating complaints of abuse in Ireland, Germany, Britain and several other countries.","NEW: ""We have to recognize the facts as they are,"" spokesman says .

"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- The death toll from flooding and mudslides in Brazil continued to climb Thursday, with official reports of at least 181 fatalities. Thousands of people have been left homeless, said the government-run Agencia Brasil news service. The Rio de Janeiro mayor's office placed that figure at 5,000. At least 161 people have been injured, the Rio de Janeiro state government said Thursday on its Web site. A record 11.3 inches (287 millimeters) of rain fell in Rio within 24 hours Tuesday, Mayor Eduardo Paes said, according to the news service. The downpour continued Wednesday. iReport: Share your photos, video, stories with CNN . More than 30 homes were destroyed in a mudslide Wednesday in metropolitan Rio, Agencia Brasil said. About 200 people could be buried or trapped in the mud, emergency officials said. The cities of Niteroi and Sao Goncalo are among the hardest hit, with more than 80 dead and dozens missing, the news service said. CNN affiliate TV Record showed firefighters, military personnel and other rescuers using heavy machinery to dig for buried residents. Brazil's minister of cities, Marcio Fortes, said that housing and sanitation problems are not new for Rio. His department, which works directly with cities on urban development projects, said that before this week's flooding, the government already had set aside some $800 million to cities to help deal with flood waters and poor infrastructure. Now, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has made available another $11 billion for drainage infrastructure across Brazil, Fortes said. As for the project that sits before them, Fortes estimated that about 4,000 homes can be rebuilt, together with better roads, schools and health centers. These would provide a shift from the current structures in the slums of Rio, where housing is often improvised. ""You can't correct the past, but you can fix the future,"" Fortes said.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona and Real Madrid have both played down suggestions that Saturday's ""El Clasico"" showdown will decide the Spanish league title. With eight matches left in the season, the two bitter rivals are locked on 77 points at the top of the table with Real ahead by just one goal on ""for-and-against"" differential. Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola  said his team would treat the match -- traditionally the biggest fixtures in the La Liga schedule -- as ""a final"" but insisted that defeat would not be terminal for either team's title hopes. ""If there were only three or four games to go I would say it is an almost decisive match, but when there are seven left afterwards it's not so much -- but it is very important,"" he told reporters on Friday. ""It's not a final, but we need to play as if it was one. It's a game where the winner will strike a blow to the other."" Barcelona triumphed 6-2 in the Spanish capital last season to move seven points clear with four games to play, and cruised to the title. Since then, Real replaced interim coach Juande Ramos with Manuel Pellegrini and new club president Florentino Perez underwrote a huge spending spree to sign stellar stars such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, Karim Benzema and Xabi Alonso. ""The 6-2 is unrepeatable. These things happen once in a lifetime, no more,"" Guardiola said. Barcelona won the corresponding home fixture 1-0 in November with a goal from striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, so a draw would give the Catalans the advantage on head-to-head record if both teams end the season still level on points. Pellegrini, with his future in the balance, knows that Real need to win. ""We will go out for the victory,"" the Chilean told reporters on Friday. ""A draw is always a bad result for my team, we've never gone out looking for a draw. We've picked up a lot of victories away from home, and more at the Bernabeu, and this game is not going to be an exception. ""We have to show why we are leaders. We've always gone out to take the game to our opponents from the start and it will be no different on this occasion. ""The league does not end tomorrow. There will still be 21 points in play and matches against difficult opponents. This is an important match, but whoever wins will make a big mistake if they think they have won La Liga, and the same goes for whoever loses because there will be seven more matches to play."" Barcelona will again be without Ibrahimovic, who injured a calf in the warmup to last weekend's 4-1 win over Athletic Bilbao and then missed the Champions League crushing of Arsenal in which Lionel Messi scored all four goals. France fullback Eric Abidal also misses out, having suffered a thigh injury on Tuesday, but central defender Gerard Pique returns after his European ban despite receiving a similar knock against Bilbao. Real will again be without injured Brazilian playmaker Kaka, who has not featured since the Champions League last-16 tie with Lyon on March 10. Midfielder Alonso and defender Sergio Ramos return from suspension after missing Sunday's 2-0 win at Racing Santander, but Pepe and Royston Drenthe are still sidelined. Madrid have won 50 of the 79 encounters between the two teams since 1929, losing just 15 times.","Real Madrid and Barcelona locked on 77 points at the top of the Spanish league table .

"Editor's note: Pedro A. Moreno García is the associate director of Hispanic Catechesis Diocese of Austin, Texas. Pedro A. Moreno García says he believes each immigrant welcomed is an opportunity for America's growth. AUSTIN, Texas (CNN)  -- A key element for the continued success of Latinos in America is the degree to which they are welcomed into our society. This country of immigrants is famous for welcoming others, especially those in most need. Any weakening of our national ability to welcome others would be a tragic deterioration of one of our nation's central values. We are at our collective best when we are deeply engaged in echoing the words of Emma Lazarus' epic poem, ""The New Colossus"" --  ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. ..."" We are at our collective worst when we are sipping from the cup of xenophobia, racism, nationalism, misandry, misogyny, homophobia or just generic hate. Welcoming is not always easy, but it enriches our nation beyond our wildest dreams. Each immigrant is a beautiful gift from the God in whom this nation places its trust. Each welcoming of a new person is an opportunity for the continued growth and progress of this country. Welcoming others, treating fellow human beings with hospitality, sets the stage for relationships to grow and develop. Welcoming others opens the door for everyone, both the one welcoming and those who are welcomed, to share the blessings and gifts that they both have. The best each person has to offer comes out more easily when hospitality is the common ground on which we walk. Each Latino can offer his or her best when hospitality is translated into ""Mi casa es tu casa."" Sadly, the opposite is also true. An absence of welcoming, and even outright rejection or persecution, not only sends many into the shadows of society but also sends into hiding their talents and gifts, thus impoverishing us all. An impoverishment of society affects every cell of that society, beginning with the family and ending with the nation itself. Again, to welcome the stranger is not easy. Sometimes it can be very uncomfortable or even painful. Being welcoming and hospitable to others can lead us to moan and complain, but the Scriptures warn us against this. In 1 Peter 4:9, New International Version, the Scriptures invite us to ""[o]ffer hospitality to one another without grumbling."" At times, our country can seem less welcoming than it was in the past. But we must continue our long history of hospitality despite the difficulties, which were also there in the past. We must also be vigilant that, as a nation, we do not fall into the temptations to close our doors, build new walls or have more armed guards standing by. Welcoming others must be done with prudence, but prudence cannot drown out compassion and generosity, and excessive prudence can become isolationism. As does the nation, many communities struggle with this temptation to isolationism. Families and even faith communities struggle with it. In my experience, in the last couple of years, various brothers and sisters from within the Roman Catholic Church have questioned, with not so charitable words, why the church would even minister to someone who is undocumented. Many do not understand that the commandment -- to love one another -- does not have an exemption clause. To quote Scripture again: ""We ought therefore to show hospitality to such men so that we may work together for the truth."" (3 John 1:8, New International Version) In the diocese of Austin, Texas, the church strives to live out the final gospel-inspired verses of Lazarus' poem, a work that can be found on a bronze plaque inside the Statue of Liberty exhibit hall. I hope and pray that these words continue to reflect our national sentiment for many years to come. ""Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"" It is the welcome and the hospitality that motivates Latinos in America to say ... ""We are truly una nación under Dios."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pedro A. Moreno García.","Pedro A. Moreno García: Lessening welcome to immigrants weakens U.S. values .

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Russian investigators have identified the second suicide bomber in last week's fatal Moscow subway attacks as Maryam Sharipova, a 28-year-old schoolteacher from Dagestan, authorities said Tuesday. Sharipova was born in the village of Balakhani, in Dagestan, a predominantly Muslim republic that lies beside Chechnya, in southern Russia, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Prosecutor's Office told CNN. Like Chechnya, Dagestan has been troubled for years by radical Islamic violence. The committee said it identified Sharipova through forensic medical examinations. Sharipova and another female bomber, Dzhennet Abdullayeva, detonated their explosives about 40 minutes apart on the morning of March 29. The blasts ripped through the Lubyanka and Park Kultury stations in central Moscow, killing 40 people and wounding more than 80. An estimated 500,000 people were riding trains in the capital at the time of the attacks. Sharipova triggered a homemade explosive device at Lubyanka subway station, the investigative committee said. Russian law enforcement bodies are continuing their ""investigative and operational search actions to determine and arrest the organizers and masterminds behind the terrorist act,"" the committee said. The woman's father, Rasul Magomedov, was flown to Moscow to identify the remains of what was believed to be his daughter, an investigative committee official told CNN on condition of anonymity. Magomedov's account and forensic analyses left no doubt that the body was that of Sharipova, the official said. Independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported Sunday in an exclusive article that Magomedov had identified his daughter in a photograph that was published on the Internet last week. The photograph was described as that of a dead unidentified suicide bomber of the Lubyanka metro station. Magomedov was sent the photograph on his mobile phone, the newspaper said. ""My wife and I have immediately recognized our daughter, Maryam,"" Magomedov told the newspaper in the article, which was reprinted across Russian media. ""When my wife had seen our daughter last, she had been wearing that same red scarf that is depicted on the photograph,"" he said. ""We didn't know her whereabouts ..."" Magomedov said he'd seen his daughter for the last time on March 26, while his wife had seen her in the afternoon of March 28, which was less than 24 hours before the deadly bombing. Several other people who knew Sharipova also recognized her in the photograph, Novaya Gazeta said. Sharipova -- who, like the other children in her family, was given the last name of her grandfather, Sharipov -- was born into a teachers family. Her father teaches Russian language and literature at a local school in Balakhani. His wife teaches biology there. Sharipova attended the same school her parents work in, the newspaper reported. She later graduated from a university in 2005 with a degree in mathematics and another in psychology, the newspaper reported. Recently, she had been teaching computer science at a local school. ""We still can't believe what happened,"" her father said, according to Novaya Gazeta. ""We can't even imagine how she appeared in Moscow."" According to the newspaper, Magomedov described his daughter as ""quite pious,"" but he said she never expressed any radical views. ""I totally rule out that someone might have manipulated her psychologically,"" he said, noting that she was a certified psychologist, the newspaper reported. ""She lived with us, worked as a schoolteacher and led an open life,"" he said. A person who knows the Magomedov family very well told the newspaper that Sharipova was a ""calm and confident person."" The person, who was not identified, said that no one ""ever heard her expressing any extremist opinions or displaying imbalanced behavior."" On Tuesday, Russian state television, citing law enforcement sources, said Sharipova had been the wife of 35-year-old Magomedali Vagabov, a local rebel leader who has been fighting government forces since the 1990s, and who reports directly to Dokku Umarov, the top Chechen rebel, who took responsibility for the bombings. The investigative committee would not comment on the report. Russian state television also showed video of Sharipova's village, and spoke to her father. ""When they [officials] called me on the phone to tell that she blew herself up in the Moscow subway, I said it must be complete rubbish,"" he recalled in an interview. Last week, the Russian investigative committee identified the first bomber as Abdullayeva, also from Dagestan. Her precise age wasn't revealed, but the committee said she was born in 1992. Russian newspapers reported Friday that Abdullayeva -- whose last name has also been cited as Abdurakhmanova -- was the widow of a prominent Dagestani rebel militant leader who was killed by federal forces in late December. An apparent photograph of Abdullayeva and her late husband, identified as 30-year-old Umalat Magomedov, was published in Russian media. It shows a bearded man with his arm draped over a young-looking teenage girl dressed in traditional Muslim attire. Both are holding guns and looking unsmilingly into the camera. The circumstances of the photograph, including when it was taken, were not explained. CNN could not confirm the authenticity of the picture. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.","Reports identify Maryam Sharipova, a graduate of Dagestan State University .

"(CNN) -- CNN picked the brains of the Plastiki's crew members before they set off on the voyage. From the importance of the mission to a pint of Cornish cider, skipper Jo Royle tells CNN about her hopes and fears, how she plans to get through the voyage, and what she looks forward to most at the end of it. CNN: What did you want to be when you were young? Royle: I wanted to engineer a way to spend as much time on or by the ocean as possible. CNN: What's the one characteristic that has led you to where you are today? Royle: Thriving off the feeling of living just outside my comfort zone. CNN: Who inspires you? Royle: Everybody! CNN: What's the most important lesson you've learned about yourself from the Plastiki project? Royle: Put your energy into your beliefs, think outside the box and it will happen. CNN: What's your biggest hope for the expedition? Royle: To communicate to as many people as possible that our oceans are our umbilical cord to life, without healthy oceans we are not healthy, no matter where we are in the world we are directly connected to the ocean. CNN: At what point would you define the Plastiki a success? Royle: The Plastiki is already a success, it has proven that we need to think about the way we consume, the way we manufacture products, how we need to think about a products end life before it is created. Most importantly it has proven that no one is as smart as everyone; the Plastiki is a success because she has created a platform for many incredible minds to collaborate and engage in conversations on how we can ensure we leave this world in a better condition than we found it for our future generations. At the moment this feels like a tough ambition, but an exciting one! CNN: What are your favorite sea creatures? Royle: Jellyfish, as we know so little about them, but their increasing population is a direct indication of the health of our oceans. Dolphins, as they are our true companions when sailing across oceans. Seals, as they look so lazy and fat, but if you get on the wrong side of them they certainly show you who's boss. CNN: When is the last time you personally used a plastic bottle? Royle: I'm not sure, but we still get guests aboard the Plastiki who leave plastic water bottles behind! Have you tried to spend just one week without consuming anything plastic? I have, and it was impossible, I had to steal my flat mate's toothpaste when I ran out! CNN: What do you most value about nature? Royle: The way she makes your life feel like such a speck in the grand scale of things, your little worries feel so insignificant, the way she can make us feel like a visitor, but has her welcoming arms wide open. If we listen and open up she naturally teaches us how to live a sustainable, healthy life. She is always boss, we can choose to respect that, and live our lives as a caretaker, or not, but in the end she will always be here. CNN: What's the one creature comfort you'll miss most when you're at sea? Royle: Cycling my bike through the countryside. My buddies and a good pint of Cornish cider! CNN: Name 3 books you will bring with you on the expedition. Royle: I will be researching my Masters dissertation on populations displaced because of human influenced climate change, so lots of journals. If anyone has anything on this topic please send it to me! I'll be taking Sylvia Earle's latest book, which I am currently reading, but not finding the time to finish. I also might take a copy of Jim Dodge's ""Stone Junction"". CNN: If you had to choose a theme song for the expedition, what would it be? Royle: ""Plastikians"" by Jerry Zeiger (written just for the Plastiki). CNN: What's your favorite adventure film? Royle: ""The Kon Tiki"". CNN: What's your green motto? Royle: The more time you spend in the natural environment, the more you will naturally become a better caretaker of the planet. CNN: What's the most important thing you've done to prepare for life at sea? Royle: Lived in a city for a year, this is the longest time for over ten years that I have not been on an ocean adventure. As much as I love San Francisco I can't wait to get back to life on the ocean. CNN: What's the main emotion you're feeling right now days before the launch? Royle: My brain is running a million miles an hour to try to dot every ""I"" and cross every ""t"" in the preparations for the passage. Once we leave we can't pick up what we have forgotten, we just have to make do with what we have. CNN: What's your biggest fear for the expedition? Royle: I don't have big fears in my mind at the moment, we have spent a long time meticulously preparing the boat with an incredible team of talent. I am a sailor, so I have a huge respect for the ocean, and understand the path to take to minimize risk, I am in my element at sea. CNN: What's the first thing you'll do when you reach Sydney? Royle: Have a shower! I'll also enjoy the post-adventure feeling of mixed emotions; having achieved an awesome adventure, but also leaving a tight knit Plastiki family life behind! Oh, and maybe party a little!","CNN asked crew members about hopes and fears for the voyage .

"(CNN) -- Winning the Masters for the third time meant the world for Phil Mickelson, but nothing could beat seeing his wife Amy and three kids waiting by the 18th green after he completed an emotional victory on Sunday. ""It was a very special and emotional moment for us because we've been through a lot this last year,"" the American told CNN after returning to second in the world golf rankings behind Tiger Woods, who tied for fourth on his comeback. ""I was so excited to see her, I wasn't sure if she was going to make it out. To see her and the kids and be able to share that moment with them is something that we'll look back on years from now and cherish."" Mickelson went into the tournament, the first of the golf season's four majors, in less than spectacular form after a traumatic year off the course. Blog: Phil's victory perfect tonic for Tiger hype . Last May, Amy was diagnosed with breast cancer, then less than two months later his mother Mary was found to have the same affliction and also required surgery. The 39-year-old took two breaks from the PGA Tour to be with his family, but successfully returned to the circuit to win the Tour Championship in September. ""We've had a lot of difficult moments in this last year, and we've been fortunate in that we've had good long-term outlook,"" he said. ""But our day-to-day has been tough, she's had a lot of side effects from the medicines and the quality of life isn't great. ""I think having something so joyous and exciting and fun for a short while makes you forget some of the symptoms that you have. ""She's been inspiring to me throughout not just this past year, but our whole marriage and relationship. But this past year, especially seeing the way she's tackled this fight and the way she's been through so much medically, I just find her to be a very inspiring individual."" In 2004, Mickelson finally rid himself of the tag ""most talented player yet to win a major"" with victory at the famous Augusta National club and claimed the green jacket for a second time two years later, having also won the U.S. PGA Championship in 2005. But Mickelson, nicknamed ""Lefty"" for his swing despite otherwise being right-handed, said he was still nervous on Sunday despite his previous successes in the Masters as he went into the final round a shot behind Englishman Lee Westwood. ""Oh absolutely, but I love it. It's my favorite thing,"" he said. ""It's the thing that was most difficult early in my career and it's the thing that I enjoy the most. ""I don't sleep the night before and I'm anxious and excited to get out on the course. You have butterflies all day and you just can't wait to get the round started. I still feel all that, but that's what makes Sunday at Augusta so special."" Mickelson said he was confident going into the tournament despite having only one top-10 finish in his previous seven starts in 2010. ""I felt like I was playing this well at the start of the year, I just haven't had the results,"" he told reporters after his victory. ""I wasn't discouraged, I felt very confident heading in here. Certainly I wanted to have some wins and be in contention, but when I get here to Augusta I get relaxed and comfortable here. I'm in love with this place, it brings out the best in me.""","Phil Mickelson says it was special to have cancer-stricken wife Amy waiting for him .

"(CNN)  -- The Texas Department of Public Safety took the unprecedented step Thursday of telling college students not to visit Mexican border cities during spring break because they are just too dangerous. Several universities issued similar warnings last year, but this was the first time the Texas law enforcement agency had issued the specific advisory against travel, said spokeswoman Tela Mange. In the past, she said, Texas authorities had just urged students to be careful. ""Because of the increased violence, we decided to step it up a little bit and say, 'Parents, bad idea,'"" Mange said. DPS Director Steven C. McCraw said, ""Parents should not allow their children to visit these Mexican cities because their safety cannot be guaranteed."" The State Department renewed a travel alert to Mexico last month, citing increased violence in the country -- border areas in particular. ""Recent violent attacks have caused the U.S. Embassy to urge U.S. citizens to delay unnecessary travel to parts of Michoacan, Durango, Coahuila and Chihuahua ... and to advise U.S. citizens residing or traveling in those areas to exercise extreme caution,"" the alert says. More than 16,000 people have died in Mexico since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the drug cartels shortly after assuming office in December 2006. Ciudad Juarez, in Chihuahua state across the border from El Paso, Texas, is the most violent city in the nation. ""The situation in the state of Chihuahua, specifically Ciudad Juarez, is of special concern,"" the alert says. Two U.S. citizens were abducted and killed in Chihuahua, the State Department said. ""Mexican authorities report that more than 2,600 people were killed in Ciudad Juarez in 2009,"" the report states. ""Additionally, this city of 1.3 million people experienced more than 16,000 car thefts and 1,900 carjackings in 2009. U.S. citizens should pay close attention to their surroundings while traveling in Ciudad Juarez, avoid isolated locations during late night and early morning hours, and remain alert to news reports."" But the problems are not limited to Juarez, the State Department says. ""Mexican drug cartels are engaged in violent conflict -- both among themselves and with Mexican security services -- for control of narcotics trafficking routes along the U.S.-Mexico border,"" the report says. ""In order to combat violence, the government of Mexico has deployed military troops throughout the country. U.S. citizens should cooperate fully with official checkpoints when traveling on Mexican highways. ""Some recent Mexican army and police confrontations with drug cartels have resembled small-unit combat, with cartels employing automatic weapons and grenades. Large firefights have taken place in towns and cities across Mexico, but occur mostly in northern Mexico, including Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana, Chihuahua City, Nogales, Matamoros, Reynosa and Monterrey. During some of these incidents, U.S. citizens have been trapped and temporarily prevented from leaving the area."" A number of areas along the border continue to experience a rapid growth in crime, with robberies, homicides, petty thefts and carjackings increasing during the past year nationwide, the alert says. The State Department reports notable spikes in Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and northern Baja California. ""Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana and Nogales are among the cities which have experienced public shootouts during daylight hours in shopping centers and other public venues,"" the alert says. CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","Texas Department of Public Safety: Mexican border cities a ""bad idea"" for spring break .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Romel Joseph calls it his second life. ""When I came here, I said I was 99.9 percent dead, and I am leaving here 85 percent alive,"" he said. The blind violinist who was trapped for 18 hours after Haiti's earthquake in January was released from a Miami, Florida, hospital over the weekend after what doctors say is an amazing recovery. The powerful January 12 quake leveled his five-story music school in Port-au-Prince, and he was pinned beneath the debris. His friends were able to remove him from the rubble of the New Victorian School, and he was airlifted out of Port-au-Prince by the American Embassy to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. Joseph suffered severe injuries, including a fractured hand and two crushed legs. To get through the painful ordeal, Joseph prayed and let his mind drift to thoughts of every concerto he had ever played. ""I didn't think I would be alive ... I thought my time was up,"" Joseph said.  ""But my time is not up yet, so God will provide and show me how to fulfill my dream."" Joseph plans to return to Haiti at the end of the month to start rebuilding the New Victorian School, where he is the director. He hopes to have a makeshift structure up within two weeks so children can begin attending the dual purpose music and academic school by mid-April. The temporary structure is estimated to cost $35,000. It will take another two to three years to build a permanent school, one that Joseph said will be earthquake-proof. During Joseph's last physical therapy session, the Juilliard-trained violinist played classical numbers and hymns as part of his treatment. To the delight of patients around him, Joseph stuck chord after chord on the violin stretching and strengthening his hand that was badly fractured. ""I couldn't put my fingers on the strings at first and gradually I was able to play little one or two notes and now I can play, not great but it's a blessing,"" Joseph said modestly. Doctors had initially feared that he might never play violin again. The violin wasn't the only instrument helping Joseph repair his shattered hand during the 18 hours of physical therapy he received each week. A keyboard donated by musician Steve Wonder has helped Joseph regain the strength in his fingers. Wonder, who is also blind, had heard Joseph's story on CNN and said he was moved to act. ""What better way to express God's love than to give something that is special to you to someone else who is in need,"" Wonder said.  ""So that's why I did what I did."" Joseph hopes to return playing professionally by October, when he would like to have a debut concert with Wonder.

"(CNN) -- An Australian rugby league player has been charged with dealing drugs just three months after his teammate was served a court notice for the same offence. Chris Houston, who plays for Newcastle Knights in the National Rugby League competition, has been charged with supplying ecstasy and cocaine according to reports in Australian newspapers on Monday. The 25-year-old second-row forward will appear in court next month, and has been suspended by his club. ""Newcastle Knights player Chris Houston has been stood down immediately and indefinitely following reports he was charged this afternoon on drug-related allegations,"" a Knights statement said on Monday. Houston's teammate Danny Wicks was charged with six counts of supplying prohibited drugs and two counts of drug possession in December. Wicks' younger brother and his sister-in-law have also been charged as part of a police investigation into drugs suppliers, along with soccer player Steven Stefanovski. Wicks and Houston both moved to Newcastle from Sydney club St George Illawarra at the end of 2007. Wicks agreed to cancel his $180,000-a-year contract in December, the Sydney Morning Herald reported, while Houston is contracted to the Knights until 2012. It is the second year in a row that the sport has been hit by controversy ahead of a new season, which begins in two weeks. Last year, Manly and Australia fullback Brett Stewart had to be removed from NRL advertisements following allegations of sexual assault. Former Newcastle and Australia star Andrew Johns also made headlines after his retirement in 2007 when he was caught in possession of ecstasy in Britain, and later admitted he had been a regular user of the drug during his career.","Australian rugby league player Chris Houston charged with dealing drugs .

"(CNN) -- For the first time in history, slavery can be brought to an end. What's more, we already know how to do it. Even if the cost of ending slavery were astronomical, we should do it -- but in fact the cost is surprisingly low. A number of forces have come together to create a unique moment. On one side there has been a recent rapid growth in the number of slaves worldwide. The population explosion, coupled with natural disasters, epidemic disease, civil war, grinding poverty, and especially government corruption, made millions of people vulnerable to slavery. The result is some 27 million people in slavery today. These are real slaves, controlled by violence, paid nothing, unable to walk away, and making fat profits for criminal slaveholders. Slaves are concentrated in South and Southeast Asia, across North and West Africa, and in South America, but virtually every country has slavery, and the U.S. is estimated to have 40,000 hidden slaves. Around the world, slaves do dirty, dangerous work, everything from agriculture to prostitution, and their lives are brutal and short. The lives of slaves have changed little over the centuries, but the price of slaves has collapsed to an all-time low. For all of history, slaves have been expensive capital investments, costing an average $45,000 in today's dollars. Today the average price of a slave is $90. This means slaves are disposable, so cheap it is not worth giving them medical care when they are sick or injured, and it's easy to just dump them when they are used up. It is an ugly problem, but at the same time, everything has clicked into place to make the end of slavery possible. The current number of slaves, 27 million, is the smallest percentage of the global population ever. The $40 billion they produce each year is the smallest fraction of the global economy ever represented by slave labor. Read more about Kevin Bales at TED.com . Slavery is illegal in every country and denounced in United Nations conventions. There is no support for slavery from moral authorities, religious or political groups. And no industry or economy is dependent on slavery. In fact, if slavery ended tomorrow, consumers wouldn't see any price increases. Slavery has been pushed to the criminal edges of our global society and to the very edge of its own extinction. There is no silver bullet that kills slavery, but over the past ten years an arsenal of effective responses has shown that you can end slavery and make communities slave-proof. One powerful vaccination against slavery is to make sure freed slaves build lives of economic stability. This means education, skill training, micro-finance, and citizenship -- all the things denied American ex-slaves in 1865. Americans are still paying the price for their botched emancipation. Meanwhile, freed slaves given opportunities today generate economic growth through a ""freedom dividend."" The modern anti-slavery movement is growing rapidly, and freedom is coming to an ever-increasing number of slaves. The end of slavery is possible, but three things have to happen. First, governments have to keep the promises they made when they passed laws against slavery. The laws are on the books, but police are untrained and budgets are woefully inadequate. Second, the public needs to be aware that slavery is all around us, and that it can be brought to an end. Third, resources have to flow to those areas of the world where slavery is rife -- resources from international aid, charities, World Bank and IMF, and businesses. More funding is needed to provide for more anti-slavery workers. When it is done right, the results are spectacular. Take the village of Azad Nagar in northern India. All the families there were hereditary slaves in a stone quarry. All children worked, there was no school, and all women risked regular sexual assault by the slaveholders. A Free the Slaves partner organization sent in a community organizer who helped the families to stand up to their masters and renounce slavery. It was a tense and dangerous tactic, and at one point the slaveholders burnt down many of the huts where the families lived. After a few months, the crisis passed and the villagers embarked on new lives, many of them now running their own quarry. The children went to school and some ex-slaves even ran for elected office. Now in stable lives, it would take an armed invasion to push them back to slavery. If you would like to know more, visit http://www.freetheslaves.net/Page.aspx?pid=183.

"(CNN) -- Venus Williams is looking forward to a continuing her winning run after retaining her Abierto Mexicano Telcel title in Acapulco on Sunday. The American followed up her victory at the Dubai Tennis Championships the previous weekend to win both tournaments for the second year in a row, taking her up to equal 10th on the all-time women's list of WTA Tour wins. Top seed Williams had to come from behind against first-time finalist Polona Hercog on the red clay before triumphing 2-6 6-2 6-3. ""I don't want to stop here -- hopefully next year I can win this one three times,"" former world No. 1 Williams told the WTA Tour Web site. ""I definitely expected her to play tough. She didn't miss too many shots and I have to give her credit, not just for today but for her whole week. Even though she was playing well, I had to find a way to make my game better. ""Hopefully I'll win more and more this year. I love winning titles, I love seeing that number go up. It feels good. There is no limit. Who wants to have a limit on titles? Not me."" Hercog did, however, win her first senior title in the doubles, as the Slovenian world No. 60 teamed up with Barbora Zahlavova Strycova of the Czech Republic to defeat Italians Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci in three sets. In the men's final, third seed David Ferrer beat Juan Carlos Ferrero 6-3 3-6 6-1 to avenge his defeat by his fellow Spaniard in last weekend's title match in Buenos Aires. Former world No. 1 Ferrero had been seeking his third title of the four-week South American leg of the ATP Tour, having also won in Costa do Sauipe in Brazil. There are no individual top-level men's tournaments this week as the focus switches to the opening round of the Davis Cup, with defending champions Spain hosting Switzerland and runners-up the Czech Republic away to Belgium. Croatia, beaten in the last four by the Czechs, are at home to promoted Ecuador while fellow semifinalists Israel travel to Chile. Other World Group matches see France take on Germany, the United States visit Serbia, Russia at home to India and Sweden against Argentina.","Top seed Venus Williams retains her Abierto Mexicano Telcel title in Acapulco .

"In few other arenas is man's never ending quest for the next frontier more evident than in sailing. The pioneering spirit, which first sent the human race out to sea to explore what lay beyond the horizon, still exists today as man strives to go faster, further, and in constant pursuit of the next extreme. Forever changing, constantly progressing, sailing is a sport driven by many factors. In today's modern world, developments in technology and yacht design give sailors an ever changing arsenal of tools, as competitors drive each other to new heights of innovation. For the ground breaking sailor, the next frontier is always just out of reach. This month on CNN MainSail, Shirley Robertson takes a look at speed -- what drives one particular breed of sailor to be the fastest on the planet? At the America's Cup in Valencia, winners BMW Oracle Racing's Head of Design explains how the Americans' revolutionary wing sail gave them the edge, and Shirley takes to the skies in a glider to see the roots of this new innovation in action. In Cowes, UK, Paul Larsen and his team of engineers skulk in the shadows of the boat building shed, as the speed record enthusiast turns his latest wild idea into reality. And in Dubai at the Month World Sailing Championships, Shirley takes to the water to experience hydrofoil sailing -- this is the innovation to which the French Hydroptere team attribute their world speed record which Larsen so badly wants to take from them. Finally Shirley meets Cameron Lewis, crew member on the first boat to sail round the world in less than 80 days -- the current Jules Verne record stands at much less than that, a target which Franck Cammas and his Groupama team are currently trying to better; Shirley talks to them via satellite phone to find out what drives them on their quest. Will this incessant pursuit of the next frontier ever fade, and what will be the next innovation to come over the horizon? This month on CNN MainSail we try to find out.","America's Cup winners explain how a revolutionary wing sail gave them the edge .

"(CNN) -- Top seed Svetlana Kuznetsova tumbled out of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells on Saturday, but two-time champion Kim Clijsters cruised into the third round. Kuznetsova, who lost in the 2007 and 2008 finals, became the first top-ranked player at the Californian tournament to lose their opening match since Clijsters in 2002. The Russian, who had an opening-round bye, lost 6-4 4-6 6-1 to unseeded Spaniard Carla Suarez-Navarro as she paid for her 69 unforced errors and seven double-faults. ""It's frustrating, because I know I have the game,"" the 24-year-old told the tournament's official Web site. ""I feel great. I do practice, play unbelievable, and then get to the match and I don't do much. ""So my thinking is I just need more matches because as soon as I have matches, I keep going."" Suarez-Navarro will play Agnes Szavay in the third round, with the Hungarian 27th seed progressing after a 6-3 6-2 victory against Taiwan's Chan Yung-Jan. U.S. Open champion Clijsters avoided suffering the same demise as fellow Belgian and former world No. 1 Justine Henin, who lost to Argentina's Gisela Dulko on Friday. Clijsters, seeded 14th in her first appearance at the tournament since winning it for the second time in 2005, thrashed Barbora Zahlavova Strycova of the Czech Republic 6-2 6-1. ""I felt good out there today,"" Clijsters told the WTA Tour Web site. ""Legs felt good, fresh. It's important in a match like this, to get through without wasting too much time, but also getting a good rhythm. ""I want to get the game I had when I was playing at the U.S. Open, where I played really well. I want to keep raising the bar."" Clijsters will next face Russian 23rd seed Alisa Kleybanova, who beat Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 6-1. Daniela Hantuchova, another two-time champion, was knocked out by Italy's Roberta Vinci. The 21st seed was upset 6-3 7-5 despite battling back from 3-0 down in the second set, with Vinci earning a third-round clash with Belgian 13th seed Yanina Wickmayer. Third seed Victoria Azarenka progressed with a 6-1 7-5 win over Austria's Sybille Bammer, and the Belarussian will next play Spanish 28th seed Maria Jose Martinez. Australian eighth seed Samantha Stosur defeated France's Julie Coin 6-1 7-6 (7-4) to set up a clash with Russian 25th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Ninth seed Flavia Pennetta also went through with a 6-3 6-3 win over Czech Petra Kvitova, and the Italian will play Israel's 17th seed Shahar Peer in the third round.","Top seed Svetlana Kuznetsova exits BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells .

"(CNN)  -- Cervelo's Xavier Tondo won the toughest stage of this year's Paris-Nice cycling classic as Alejandro Valverde finished second to ratchet up the pressure on race leader and their fellow Spaniard Alberto Contador. It was the biggest victory of Tondo's fledgling career and reward for a solo break with just under 40km remaining of the 220km ride from Peynier to Tourrettes-super-Loup. The whittled down chasing bunch closed fast in the final kilometers but Tondo had five seconds to spare with Valverde leading the charge to claim six bonus seconds. It left him 14 seconds adrift of reigning Tour de France champion Contador ahead of a difficult final day in the south of France. Young Slovakian Peter Sagan, who claimed his second stage win of the race in dramatic style pm Friday, finished third to retain the green jersey of points leader. Tondo was delighted to win in his debut year for Cervelo, with his main duties this season set to be as a helper for Carlos Sastre in the Giro d'Italia and other major tours. He felt he was ready to challenge on Friday, but suffered bad luck with a mechanical problem, dropping over two minutes to lose his chance for the overall crown. ""It gave me a chance to go in the breakaway today and I felt very good on the climb,"" he told the official Web site www.letour.fr. ""It's incredible for me, in my first year with Cervelo. It's my 10th victory as a pro, but in the past I only rode for small teams,"" he added. Sunday's final leg is a 119km stage based around Nice with several tough climbs where Contador has predicted he will seal his final victory. Meanwhile, last year's winner Michele Scarponi claimed the fourth stage of the Tirreno-Adriatico to take the overall lead. Scarponi was in a small elite group who forged clear about 4km from the finish of the 243-km route from San Gemini to Chieti. He now leads Benoit Vaugrenard of France by 18 seconds in the overall classification.","Spain's Xavier Tondo claims sixth stage of the Paris-Nice cycling classic .

"(CNN) -- At first, Kip Scheidler said he felt the ground tremble. Then the roof began to shake. Tiles tumbled from the ceiling as people bolted from their chairs to escape. When Scheidler tried to follow them, he could barely keep his balance as the ground wobbled. ""The weird thing is that afterward you will swear that it lasted 20 minutes but it really lasted 60 seconds,"" Scheidler said of the earthquake tremors. ""But at the moment, it seems like it will never stop, and it keeps getting stronger."" That's how Scheidler remembers one of the most horrific moments in his life -- the 1986 earthquake in El Salvador that killed 1,500 people. All those memories came flooding back recently when Scheidler turned on CNN and saw images from this week's earthquake in Haiti, which may have killed at least 100,000 people, according to initial estimates. ""I was sickened by the news,"" said Scheidler, now the senior director for global disaster response for Habitat for Humanity International, an international relief agency. ""I was there [El Salvador] as family members identified the bodies of family members pulled from the rubble. It's something that you can never forget. I can't imagine hundreds of thousands of people going through that now."" For people like Scheidler, the news from Haiti isn't abstract. It's personal. They are people who have either survived natural disasters or respond to them. The Haitian earthquake has forced some of them to think again about the survival lessons they learned, and what Haitians face in the days ahead. How disaster brings out best, worst in human nature . Several say disasters can reveal the worst in human nature. Patrick Johns traveled to Indonesia in the immediate aftermath of the 2004 Tsunami. He's also traveled to Ethiopia to aid in famine relief and Rwanda after the country was decimated by genocide. Johns, who is now the director of emergency response for Catholic Relief Services, said it is critical to immediately establish security right in Haiti. ""Crime is a problem in Haiti even in the best of times,"" Johns said. ""With this kind of situation, it's going to go from bad to worse."" Security can make the difference between life and death, Johns said. It's not enough to deliver the right supplies to Haitians. Someone has to guard the good Samaritans. ""You could get stopped on the road, your driver could be thrown in the ditch and you lose everything,"" Johns said. People responding to the disasters often have to make excruciating choices, Johns said. In the past, aid workers would help some needy people but turn down others when they ran out of supplies. How an aid workers makes that decision can cause a riot, Johns said. It's better to talk to people beforehand to warn them that not everyone will get help immediately, but eventually all will be helped, he said. ""If you can only build 30 ramshackle shelters, who are the 30 who get them and what's going to be the reaction of people who don't get help,"" Johns said. ""It can be nightmarish."" See other places hit by historic natural disasters and their recovery . Another disaster lesson: Don't wait for the authorities to help, several disaster experts said. Tad Agoglia is the founder of the the First Response Team. Since May 2007, he and his crew have aided thousands of victims at disaster sites across the United States, free of charge, he said. Agoglia said disaster survivors become energized when they stop waiting for the cavalry and start doing what they can within the first ten hours of the disaster. When people act, they shake off their stupor, he said. ""Things start moving. Roads are opened up. Order comes to chaos and people start to speak to each other,"" Agoglia said. ""People began to have hope. They say, 'It's not going to last like this forever. We can begin again.' '' Impact Your World: How you can help . One of the most important needs for Haitians right now isn't just food, water and medicine but something else: heavy moving equipment, Agoglia said. Agoglia's company has three cranes as well as infrared cameras that can spot body heat under rubble and lighting towers that illuminate the darkness. It might not be as obvious as delivering water, but it's vital, he said. ""Bringing in food and water and those kind of things are great, but there's only so much you can do with human hands,"" Agoglia said. Disasters also require leadership -- not from so far-off entity but from ordinary Haitians in the hardest-hit areas, some said. During disasters, community leaders become critical, said Eddie Argenal, director of humanitarian assistance for CHF International, a relief agency based in Silver Spring, Maryland. Community leaders can quickly take an estimate of the damage done, their community's needs, and start clean-up efforts. They give their communities a head-start, Argenal said. ""Humanitarian assistance can take time to arrive, so the community plays a hugely important role in their own recovery,"" Argenal said. ""The more proactive a community is, the better they will do in the short and long term."" How communities rebuild after disaster . History gives Haitians a reason to hope. Virtually every major city that's been demolished since 1800 has been rebuilt -- no matter how poor the city was or where it was located, said Lawrence J. Vale, co-author of ""The Resilient City: How Modern Cities Recover from Disaster."" Vale said people have such a fierce attachment to where they live that they will go to extraordinary lengths to rebuild their homes. Vale said he remembers seeing pictures of residents in New Orleans mowing their lawns in front of their destroyed homes after Hurricane Katrina struck. He also saw a picture of Japanese schoolchildren in Hiroshima, Japan, holding their lessons outdoors in 1946, a year after an atomic bomb had vaporized their city. ""They're attempting got have some semblance of normalcy in this totally surreal, devastating landscape,"" Vale said. ""It's an extraordinary testament to the effort of people to go on."" Scheidler, the survivor of the El Salvador earthquake, has seen the same resiliency. After the initial quake, there is a surge of adrenalin, he said. People spread out and rush to their homes to check on relatives. People are nervous, trying to put the pieces together. Then they start to rally around one another. Scheidler said he visited a neighborhood in El Salvador that had been buried by a mudslide after the earthquake struck. Nobody waited for the authorities. ""People who had construction equipment starting showing up and afterward everybody was grabbing everything they could, whether it was a shovel or a gardening tool, to help dig through the dirt,"" Scheidler said. Scheidler said the buildings in one community had been flattened, including its church. But the community searched and found the church bell. What they did with the church bell is seared in his memory today just as much as the scenes of tragedy he witnessed, he said. ""They rallied around the church bell, and put it in a tree so they could call everybody together,"" he said. ""What I saw in people in El Salvador was not every man for himself; but everybody pitching in.""","Disaster witnesses reflect on painful lessons learned .
Destruction on vast scale brings out the best and worst in human nature .

"London, England (CNN) -- News International announced plans Friday to charge for access to The Times and The Sunday Times Web sites starting in June. The publisher said both British newspapers will launch new Web sites in early May and offer a free trial period to registered customers. Starting in June, each site will charge £1 ($1.48) for a day's access or £2 ($2.96) for a week's subscription, News International said. The newspapers are currently available free on a combined site, www.timesonline.co.uk, but they will have separate sites starting in May. Subscribers will have access to both sites, News International said. ""At a defining moment for journalism, this is a crucial step towards making the business of news an economically exciting proposition,"" said Rebekah Brooks, chief executive at News International. ""We are proud of our journalism and unashamed to say that we believe it has value."" Would you pay to read your news on the web? The only other major British newspaper currently charging for online content is the Financial Times, which charges a basic rate of £3.29 ($4.90) a week for a year-long subscription. Users can view up to 10 online articles for free each month, but they must register. In its Alphaville blog, the Financial Times said ""this experiment will be closely watched by the embattled media industry."" The paper's digital media correspondent Tim Bradshaw wrote there are already doubts about the success of the paid-for plan. ""The wide availability of free news online has led many to question whether paywalls can attract substantial numbers of customers,"" Bradshaw wrote. ""In the UK, newspapers face online competition from the BBC, which earlier this month pledged to curtail the scope of its Web sites."" Brooks, of News International, said the company expects to attract a growing base of customers with the online subscriptions. She also indicated the plan could be extended to cover the company's other two British titles, tabloids The Sun and News of the World. ""This is just the start,"" Brooks said. Sunday Times Editor John Witherow said the planned subscription price will be a bargain, costing about the same as a cup of coffee. Comments on the story in the Media section of The Guardian's Web site -- which is free -- were mixed. ""Bye bye to the Times then,"" wrote a user named rocketracer. ""This goes against the basic principle of the internet which is about increasing access to information not restricting it."" Another user called jodro wrote, ""Much as it pains me to say it, like everyone I like things for free, but some kind of Internet payment structure is the only way to rescue quality journalism and an independent press that can counterbalance the increasing powers that technological developments hand to governments worldwide."" Last year Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and CEO of News International's parent company News Corp., said the current free access business model favored by most content providers was flawed. ""We are now in the midst of an epochal debate over the value of content and it is clear to many newspapers that the current model is malfunctioning,"" he said. Murdoch said the experience of the News Corp.-owned Wall Street Journal had proved that charging for content could be made to work. He said 360,000 people had downloaded an iPhone WSJ application in three weeks. Users would soon be made to pay ""handsomely"" for accessing WSJ content, he added. The media tycoon has also repeatedly threatened to pull his company's news Web sites from Google and put all company sites that are currently free behind a pay wall. Google strengthens news content walls . His international newspaper empire includes the New York Post, the News International stable of UK titles including the Sun and the Times, and a cluster of Australian papers including the Daily Telegraph and the Herald Sun. His comments come with the U.S. newspaper industry in a state of crisis amid plunging advertising revenues and falling circulations with several historic titles already going out of business.","Both newspapers will launch new Web sites in early May, offering free trial to users .

"London, England (CNN) -- British Airways was able to get three out of four planes to their destination this weekend despite the ongoing strike by cabin crew, the airline's CEO, Willie Walsh, said Sunday. Walsh told CNN he was ""clearly disappointed for customers who have had disrupted travel plans but I'm really pleased that we have been able to do so much and we are determined to keep this going. ""We have had high numbers of cabin crew turning up for work. We wouldn't have been able to fly such a significant operation if we didn't have cabin crew supporting us,"" he said. But the assistant general secretary of the Unite union, which represents the cabin crew, said BA was losing money and shifting customers onto other airlines in a ""con trick."" Are you worried about the strike? ""BA is claiming that it can function but it is doing so by throwing away millions of pounds every day as it dumps its passengers on other carriers,"" Unite's Len McClusky said in a statement. ""Passengers who turn up expecting to fly BA, a brand they trust and have paid a premium for, will now be shipped onto carriers they've never heard of."" British Airways and Unite have been at odds for more than a year over changes the airline wants to make to cabin crew pay and work practices. BA says the changes will save the company more than 60 million pounds ($90 million) a year. Unite has said the plans, which call for longer work hours and less staffing, will damage customer service and the BA brand. At least 51 British Airways flights leaving Heathrow Sunday were listed as canceled on the airport's Web site, and at least 79 arrivals were listed as canceled, as of 10:30 local time (5:30 a.m. ET). Destinations in the UK, United States, Europe, Africa and the Middle East were directly affected by the cancellation of BA flights. And other airlines such as American Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Iberia were showing flight cancellations because of code-sharing. The union claimed half of British Airways flights were canceled on Sunday. BA in the past has said it is legally bound as a publicly traded company to provide accurate information, while the union is under no such obligations. The latest strike, which began Saturday, meant American student Brittany Smith and her family were being rerouted from London's Heathrow to Atlanta, Georgia, on their way home to Denver, Colorado. She has already e-mailed her professors to explain that she will not make class. ""It is frustrating, but if you let it frustrate you, you're just going to ruin your travel plans even more,"" she told CNN. ""So you are just going to have to take it with a grain of salt, and realize that everyone is doing the best they can and to make it easier on everyone to stay positive."" The four-day strike is the union's second one in a month over pay and working conditions. It staged a three-day walkout last weekend . BA said its operations got off to a good start Saturday despite the strike by thousands of its cabin crew members. The airline said it was able to operate flights as normal at two London airports, Gatwick and City, and that the number of crew members reporting for work at Heathrow was enough to operate BA's planned schedule. It said enough staff had crossed the picket lines that it was able to fly more than 75 percent of customers scheduled to travel during the strike. Another 18 percent of passengers are booked to fly on other carriers or have changed their travel dates to avoid the strike, the airline said. Advice for passengers . The Unite union, which represents 95 percent of BA's 15,000 cabin crew, said it was too early say how many crew members worked despite the strike. The airline said it will be able to run a full operation from London's Gatwick and City airports. At London's Heathrow Airport, BA will be able to run up to 55 percent of its short-haul flights and up to 70 percent of its long-haul flights, the airline said. Gatwick-based cabin crew work under different conditions, which is why the strike affects one airport more than the other. BA handed a statement to passengers on some long-haul flights, reassuring them the airline's own staff was working on board. ""British Airways pilots will be flying your aircraft and you will be cared for in the cabin by British Airways staff,"" the statement read. ""Some of these staff in the cabin may be additional pilots who have volunteered to look after you, and as such will be wearing their pilot uniforms."" Pauline Doyle, a spokeswoman for Unite, said having pilots standing in as flight attendants ""undermines"" the relationship between cabin crew and pilots. Pauline Doyle, a spokeswoman for Unite, said having pilots standing in as flight attendants ""undermines"" the relationship between cabin crew and pilots. Other carriers are offering to accommodate BA passengers affected by the strike. British carrier BMI, which flies to Europe and the Middle East, said Friday it had added 4,500 seats to its normal Heathrow flight schedule and Ryanair offered special fares to BA passengers. CNN's Erin McLaughlin contributed to this report.","British Airways: ""We will fly more than 75 percent of customers booked to travel""

"(CNN) -- Ireland's government-backed ""bad bank"" is taking on 16 billion euros ($21.5 billion) in debt from five troubled Irish banks -- a first step toward buying 81 billion euros ($109 billion) in bad loans, the government announced. The National Asset Management Agency, as the ""bad bank"" is officially known, will pay 8.5 billion euros ($11.4 billion) for the first 16 billion euros in debt, it said Tuesday. The move takes 1,200 loans off the books of Irish Nationwide Building Society, EBS Building Society, Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks and Anglo Irish Bank. The first two banks' debts were taken over on Monday and the other three institutions' bad loans should be transferred by early April, NAMA said. Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan gave a sobering assessment of the banks' health Tuesday. ""I understand why many want us to close"" Anglo Irish Bank, which lost huge sums in property lending, he told lawmakers. ""I understand the impulse to obliterate it from the system."" But, he said, ""the sums required to rescue the bank are enormous but the costs of winding it down are even greater."" The government has already replaced the management of the bank. Lenihan hinted broadly that the government will take over Allied Irish Bank, which he said must raise ""additional equity capital of at least 7.4 billion euros ($9.9B) by the end of the year."" ""If sufficient private capital is not available, it is probable that the state will have a majority shareholding in Allied Irish Bank as a listed entity, but this is much more preferable than an under-capitalized or only adequately-capitalized entity,"" he said. The government is seeking to sell Irish Nationwide or merge it with another entity as soon as possible, after having taken it over earlier, he said. The Bank of Ireland ""expects to be able to raise private capital and is well advanced in its actions to address its capital needs,"" and EBS is in talks with ""a private party"" about raising market capital, he added. The move is part of an Irish government response to the global financial crisis, which hit Ireland particularly hard. The government expects to complete the purchase of the 81 billion euros in debt by February of next year, a deadline set by the European Union, NAMA said. Borrowers whose loans have been acquired by NAMA will be required to submit a comprehensive business plan in accordance with NAMA's template within one month outlining how they propose to honor their loan commitments, NAMA chief executive Brendan McDonagh said in a statement. If the plans are not submitted or not approved, ""NAMA will take whatever actions it considers necessary to protect the interests of the taxpayer,"" he said. CNN's Jim Boulden and Eve Parish contributed to this report.","Move takes 1,200 loans off books .

"Rome, Italy (CNN)  -- The Vatican is overhauling its rules on how it handles accusations of sexual abuse by priests, it said Monday, without giving any details. The powerful Catholic Church body that handles such allegations has been working on updating the 2001 rules ""for some time,"" the Vatican said. It published a new summary of its procedures on sexual abuse cases Monday, as it fights the perception that it has tried to hush up abuse in the past. The summary said the overhaul is taking place. The church has been badly shaken by allegations of widespread child abuse by clergy in deeply Catholic Ireland, and hundreds of people who say they were abused have come forward in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. Internal Catholic Church documents have surfaced in the United States which critics say link Pope Benedict XVI personally to attempts to cover up abuse. The Vatican says the letters in question, about a Wisconsin priest accused of molesting hundreds of deaf boys over two decades, were not written to Rome until long after the abuse took place. The one-page document published Monday outlines the official steps diocese should take if a priest is accused of abuse, how to escalate complaints to Rome, and possible punishments for those found guilty. It does not appear to contain new guidance -- only to consolidate existing practices into one document. It is designed primarily to help the media understand Church procedures, Father Ciro Benedettini of the Vatican press office told CNN. The summary, produced by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, says local diocese ""investigate every allegation of sexual abuse of a minor by a cleric."" If the allegation ""has a semblance of truth,"" the local diocese refers it to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Local diocese should also report the allegations to the appropriate civil authorities if local law requires, the guidelines say. The pope was head of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, before being enthroned as Benedict XVI in 2005.","Vatican publishes new summary of procedures on sexual abuse cases .

"London, England (CNN) -- British Airways said its operations got off to a good start Saturday despite a second consecutive strike by thousands of its cabin crew members. The airline said it was able to operate flights as normal at two London airports, Gatwick and City, and that the number of crew members reporting for work at Heathrow -- Britain's busiest airport -- was enough to operate its planned schedule. ""We have got off to a good start,"" the airline said in a statement. The crews walked out at midnight Friday in a strike set to last for four days. They staged a three-day walkout last weekend. BA said enough staff had crossed the picket lines that it was able to fly more than 75 percent of customers scheduled to travel during the strike. Another 18 percent of passengers are booked to fly on other carriers or have changed their travel dates to avoid the strike. Are you worried about the strike? The Unite union, which represents 95 percent of BA's 15,000 cabin crew, said it was too early say how many crew members worked despite the strike. At Heathrow's Terminal 5, which is used primarily by British Airways, things appeared to be running smoothly Saturday and long-haul passengers who spoke to CNN seemed largely unaffected. ""It's been fine from Seattle, (Washington) and I hope it will be fine going back to Seattle,"" passenger Don Dewar said. Ravi Erukulabatn said his mother-in-law was still scheduled to fly to Hyderabad, India. ""She is flying on her own, so we were a bit anxious to begin with, bur fortunately it is happening as expected,"" he told CNN. The airline said it will be able to run a full operation from London's Gatwick and City airports. At Heathrow, BA will be able to run up to 55 percent of its short-haul flights and up to 70 percent of its long-haul flights, the airline said. To help operate as many flights as possible, BA is leasing planes, pilots and crews from six airlines, BA said. It is also using volunteers from other areas of the company to stand in for striking cabin crew. BA handed a statement to passengers on some long-haul flights, reassuring them the airline's own staff was working on board. ""British Airways pilots will be flying your aircraft and you will be cared for in the cabin by British Airways staff,"" the statement read. ""Some of these staff in the cabin may be additional pilots who have volunteered to look after you, and as such will be wearing their pilot uniforms."" Pauline Doyle, a spokeswoman for Unite, said having pilots standing in as flight attendants ""undermines"" the relationship between cabin crew and pilots. BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh had threatened last week to take away the travel perks, which might have been one reason some union staff agreed to work despite the strike last weekend. Striking staff stripped of perks . He said the travel perks are not in the crews' contracts and can be withdrawn at the airline's discretion. The union representing the striking workers called the move ""vindictive"" and said restoring those perks must be part of any deal to end the strike. ""The withdrawal of travel concessions from crew who have been on strike represents unacceptable anti-union bullying,"" Unite joint leaders Derek Simpson and Tony Woodley wrote in a letter to members. ""Any agreement to end this dispute must and will include a framework for the full restoration of those travel concessions."" Other carriers are offering to accommodate BA passengers affected by the strike. British carrier BMI, which flies to Europe and the Middle East, said Friday it had added 4,500 seats to its normal Heathrow flight schedule and Ryanair offered special fares to BA passengers. British Airways and Unite have been at odds for more than a year over changes the airline wants to make to cabin crew pay and work practices. BA says the changes will save the company more than 60 million pounds ($90 million) a year. Unite has said the plans, which call for longer work hours and less staffing, will damage customer service and the BA brand. Stock analysts have said BA has made clear it sees the action not only as a matter of money but who will run the airline -- management or the union. Unite said Friday the two strikes will cost British Airways about £100 million ($149 million), double what BA estimated earlier in the week.","British Airways says it was able to operate flights as normal at two London airports .

"Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- Arthur Budzinski wiped away the tear running down his cheek. He had just returned from the basement, where he was talking to Gary Smith, a longtime friend and former classmate. The two men, both deaf, feverishly gestured to one another in sign language over a videophone, discussing the recently released documents relating to a Milwaukee priest molesting students -- the same priest they said had molested them. The New York Times reported the documents showed top Vatican officials, including the future Pope Benedict XVI, had failed to discipline the now-deceased Milwaukee priest, the Rev. Lawrence Murphy.  According to the report, Murphy abused as many as 200 deaf boys in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from 1950 to 1974. Read the article . Back upstairs, Budzinski, 61, sat next to his daughter, Gigi, who translated his story. Her father, she said matter of factly, was abused three times by Murphy while a student at St. John's School for the Deaf in St. Francis, a suburb of Milwaukee nestled on the banks of Lake Michigan.  Timeline of Father Murphy's case . Budzinski said he was 12 the first time it happened. ""It was in the closet. I asked for a confession, and then he molested me,"" he said, adding the abuse occurred once a year for three years. ""I was wondering ... 'You're a man from the church, why are you molesting me?'"" He was unable to tell his story at the time, because his parents did not know sign language. For years, he blocked out the memories of the abuse, until they came flooding back when he was in his 20s. It was during the 1970s that Budzinski, Smith and another friend and classmate, Robert Bolger started sharing their experiences with each other. ""If you don't tell people, it gets worse, and it will happen more and more,"" Budzinski said. ""You need to speak out and be open."" The three friends found strength in numbers. It was time to tell their secret and put an end to the sexual abuse against deaf boys by Murphy, Budzinski said. They held public protests where they circulated ""Wanted"" fliers with Murphy's image. They went to the Milwaukee County district attorney's office and the St. Francis Police Department to file complaints against the priest. Murphy denied the allegations, and no criminal charges were filed. ""Robert Bolger always said 'It's the three of us,'"" Budzinski said. Bolger died in 2006. ""I'm sad that Robert's gone, but I am in his place fighting, because Robert was the leader."" Budzinski has been sharing his story since the 1970s, but now the world is aware. The headlines from the March 25 New York Times story had circled the globe. ""I fought for 37 years, it finally broke open, I'm surprised,"" Budzinski said. ""What's next, I don't know. But something should happen."" Days after the Times' report, the archbishop of Milwaukee apologized repeatedly for the way his archdiocese handled the priest. He also defended the Vatican, which has come under fire for not disciplining or defrocking the man. ""Mistakes were made in the Lawrence Murphy case,"" said Archbishop Jerome Listecki at the end of a special Holy Week mass at St. John's Cathedral in Milwaukee. ""The mistakes were not made in Rome in 1996, 1997 and 1998. The mistakes were made here, in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, in the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s, by the church, by civil authorities, by church officials, and by bishops. ""And for that, I beg your forgiveness in the name of the church and in the name of this Archdiocese of Milwaukee."" The Vatican said it did not know about the allegations until 20 years after civil authorities investigated and later dropped the case.  Murphy died in 1998. The Holy See has criticized The New York Times' coverage of Murphy's case, saying it lacks fairness.   More on the Vatican's criticism . Budzinski moved on with his life, becoming a journeyman printer, a husband and a father to two daughters. But the memories of the abuse stayed with him. He said he repeatedly told church officials about Murphy. ""When he was 26 he had to go to the police, he was talking to Archbishop Cousins, he was doing all this,"" said Gigi, who began to weep. ""I could never imagine right now, me having to do that."" In 2006, Budzinski said he received $80,000 from the archdiocese for his suffering. Despite being haunted by the abuse and upset with how his case was handled, he said he has been blessed. ""He always thought, 'I want to have children,'"" Gigi said. ""Now he's happy he has me and my sister."" The Budzinskis vow to continue sharing their story to help all victims of abuse, whether deaf or hearing. ""I want to help people,"" he said. ""Father Murphy died and I'm still doing it. ... I keep fighting.""","Arthur Budzinski says he was abused by a Milwaukee priest as a child at a school for the deaf .

"(CNN) -- We have a tendency, when things in the news get bad, to tell ourselves that it's never been quite this dismal before. We are tempted, when disputes become particularly acrimonious, to believe that the current bitterness is unprecedented. So it's beneficial, once in a while, to look at our current problems in light of what has gone before. And to remember just how much the United States has endured. The newspaper USA Today reported last week that there has been a sharp increase in the unemployment rate for male veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The paper said that such unemployment has tripled since the recession began, having reached 15 percent last month. More than 250,000 of the male veterans were said to be unemployed last month, with another 400,000 having left the workforce for various reasons: to raise children, or attend college, or because they have just stopped trying to find work. Joe Davis, a spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said: ""It makes you almost want to go out and rip off all the 'Support Your Troops' bumper stickers. If you want to support your troops, give them a job."" Can't argue with that. After what American soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are asked to sacrifice, there is something melancholy about the thought of them coming home and having trouble finding a way to support their families. The nation is likely to work on a solution to this honorably and in good faith. There was a time, during parallel circumstances, when that wasn't the case. It was one of the darkest moments in American history, and few people speak about it anymore. The shorthand for it was ""the Bonus Army."" In the spring and summer of 1932, with the Great Depression gripping the country, tens of thousands of World War I veterans and their families gathered in Washington to demand what they felt they had been promised. They set up shantytowns, and vowed to stay put until their entreaties were met. The federal government had, in 1924, issued service certificates -- redeemable for bonuses -- to the soldiers who had returned from World War I. The certificates were intended to reward the veterans for the time they had spent fighting for their country. They were like long-term bonds -- they could not be redeemed until 1945. But something happened between 1924 and 1932: The economy collapsed. Poverty and joblessness were everywhere. The veterans, many of them hungry and destitute, came to Washington asking Congress to allow them to collect their bonuses early. It didn't happen. The U.S. Senate voted down the bill. So there were the military veterans, amassed in the nation's capital. Out of money, out of luck, almost out of hope, they refused to leave. The government ordered their evacuation. Many of the veterans resisted; the police shot and killed two of them. With that, the president of the United States, Herbert Hoover, fearing that radicals had infiltrated the veterans, ordered the Army to take over the involuntary evacuation. And this country was confronted with the news that the Army was moving against the old soldiers. At the highest level of the Army assigned to the task were men who would later become extraordinarily famous. Gen. Douglas MacArthur was in command; Maj. Dwight D. Eisenhower was the go-between with the local police force; Maj. George Patton was in charge of the cavalry. Bayonets were drawn; tanks and soldiers on horseback advanced into the crowds; acrid gas was unleashed on the protesting veterans; the makeshift camps were torn down. Even though President Hoover didn't want it to happen, MacArthur sent his troops across a bridge to the site of the veterans' main living quarters. A fire broke out; it was never determined with certainty who set it, but there it was: the American veterans' cobbled-together homes in flames, as the Army drove them out. There was no television back then; it is almost impossible to fathom what would have happened if the country had been able to see, live, the military moving relentlessly against former members of the military who were asking for the means to survive. As rugged as the economy is now -- and as difficult a time as some veterans are having as they look for work in a dismal hiring environment -- no one foresees a day when soldiers will again be ordered to roust former soldiers and their families. Later in their lives, MacArthur, Eisenhower and Patton all lamented, with varying degrees of emotion, having had to play a role in driving the Bonus Army out of Washington. Their commander in chief had decreed that it must be done, so they carried out his orders. We've come a long way since then; no president with an eye toward his legacy would order the Army to do such a thing, and it's hard to believe that military officials would not, behind closed doors, try everything in their power to avoid having to use American troops that way. But as much as things have changed, certain truths haven't. We ask our soldiers, in times of war, to cross the oceans and fight in our name. When they come home -- those who do come home alive -- we tell them, in bad economic times, that the jobs for them are just not there. If our soldiers want to work, we owe it to them to make it easier for that to happen. There may never again, we should hope, be a Bonus Army camped in the streets of Washington, pleading for help. The best way to prevent such a sight is to provide the help before the despair of the unemployed veterans reaches that breaking point. You might call it our patriotic duty. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","People have a tendency to think we live in the worst of times, says Bob Greene .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- France's President Nicolas Sarkozy made a landmark visit to Haiti Wednesday, announcing more than $100 million of additional aid to the former French colony where 212,000 people were killed by an earthquake five weeks ago. Sarkozy is the first French president ever to visit the country which has in the past demanded huge reparations from France to compensate for slavery-era exploitation before Haitian independence two centuries ago . He told a news conference that an extra €100 million ($136 million) was being made available to help reconstruction efforts, bringing France's contribution to the the aid effort to €320 million. Sarkozy was scheduled to meet with Haitian President Rene Preval and Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive and take a helicopter tour of earthquake-devastated zones, Sarkozy's office said. He also planned to tour a French Civil Security hospital and meet with French teams and injured Haitians, his office said. He planned to meet members of the government involved in reconstruction and members of the United Nations mission in Haiti. Sarkozy's trip was scheduled to last less than five hours, after which he planned to go to the French island of Martinique for an overnight stay. Thursday, Sarkozy planned to visit French Guiana on South America's northeastern coast before returning home, his office said. Sarkozy is the first European head of state to visit Haiti since the January 12 earthquake, Agence France-Presse reported. France has had close cultural ties with its former colony since independence, but diplomatic relations have sometimes been fraught, with Paris occasionally expressing concerns over instability in the Caribbean nation. In 2004, France called for the resignation of then president Jean Bertrand Arstide, who was subsequently ousted in a 2004 rebellion, after his government  demanded that France pay $21 billion in reparations.","Sarkozy expected to meet Haiti's president and prime minister on flying visit .

"(CNN)  -- Portsmouth will play Chelsea in the FA Cup final after an upset 2-0 extra-time victory over Tottenham Hotspur in the second semifinal at Wembley on Sunday. French striker Frederic Piquionne opened the scoring for Avram Grant's men nine minutes into extra-time. Former Tottenham midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng scored the second with three minutes remaining from the penalty spot after referee Alan Wiley awarded a spot kick as Wilson Palacios fouled Aruna Dindane. It was a humiliating defeat for Tottenham and their manager Harry Redknapp, who steered Portsmouth to FA Cup triumph in 2008 before leaving the cash-strapped club for White Hart Lane. His team went into the match as overwhelming favorites against a Pompey team who had been relegated from the Premier League the day before without playing, having been deducted nine points after going into administration. But all that was forgotten as their fanatical fans enjoyed a famous victory which owed much to good fortune and some excellent goalkeeping from England international David James. Their breakthrough goal could be credited to the appalling Wembley pitch as Spurs defender Michael Dawson slipped at a crucial moment and Piquionne took full advantage. Tottenham thought they had equalized almost immediately through Peter Crouch but Wiley ruled it out for a push on James. With Tottenham camped in the Pompey half, Dindane broke clear and although Palacios got the ball in his challenge he also pulled him down and Wiley had no hesitation in pointing to the spot. Spurs reject Boateng scored past Heurelho Gomes with relish to seal a famous cup victory. An overjoyed James said they had deserved their win after being written off before the semifinal. ""We played very well throughout the team, he told ITV. ""Look what it means to Pompey, it's fantastic. ""We were eight- or nine-to-one to win beforehand but we have proved people wrong."" In truth, Tottenham had been the more accomplished side in a generally scrappy match and Crouch will be rueing a headed miss against his former side in the second half in which he also hit the post. Aaron Mokoena had to make a goalline clearance from a Vedran Corluka cross in Tottenham's best spell of pressure, but Pompey were always a threat on the break and took their chances when offered. They will play double-chasing Chelsea at Wembley on May 15 and again will start as massive underdogs.","Portsmouth beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 in FA Cup semifinal at Wembley .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistani court Friday extended the custody of five Americans  for an additional 10 days to allow time for police to complete investigations. The men, suspected of plotting terror attacks, were arrested in the small city of Sargodha earlier this month and transferred to Lahore, police said. Court officials extended the custody after a plea from the police, said Tahir Gujjar, a local police official. The five are identified as Ahmed Abdullah Minni, Umar Farooq, Aman Hassan Yemer, Waqar Hussain Khan and Ramy Zamzam. A sixth man -- the father of one of the five -- also was arrested, police said. An order keeping the five in custody expired Friday. To keep them in jail after that, police had to get permission from a judge, said Usman Anwar, Sargodha police chief . Anwar, who heads the Joint Investigation Team, said the group plans to recommend that the five be charged under the country's anti-terrorism act. Conviction under that law can result in up to a life sentence. Pakistani authorities have described the men as college students who ""were of the opinion that a jihad must be waged against the infidels for the atrocities committed by them against Muslims around the world."" The suspects include two Pakistani-Americans, two Yemeni-Americans and an Egyptian-American.

"(CNN) -- On Easter Sunday, the day before the explosion that would take his life, Joshua Napper got saved while attending church with his family, his mother said. When he left her home in Ohio to go work in West Virginia's Upper Big Branch South Mine, Napper left behind letters for his girlfriend and small daughter. According to his mother, Pam Napper, the letters told them, ""If anything happens to me, I'll be looking down from heaven at you all."" He told his girlfriend he loved her and asked that ""my baby girl"" be taken care of, Pam Napper said. ""He grabbed my hand and he said, 'Mom, I love you,' "" she said. ""I said, 'I love you too, Josh, I'll always love you.' "" Were you and your family affected by the blast? Share your story . Joshua Napper died in the mine Monday, along with his uncle, Timmy Davis, and his cousin, Corey Davis, Timmy Davis' son. At least 22 others are dead following the explosion. ""I just think he knew what was going to happen,"" Pam Napper told CNN's John Roberts. She said she knew that day that something had gone wrong in the mine. ""I was just sitting on the couch that morning, Monday, and I just felt in my heart and my stomach that something was definitely wrong,"" she said. Joshua Napper had been working in the mine for eight weeks. When he asked his mother if he could, she initially said no but gave in after he begged her. ""He said, 'Please, mom,' "" she said. ""I said, 'OK, you're 25. I have to let you go. I have to let you make your own decisions in life.' "" She said her son called her one day last week at 3:30 p.m., long before he should have gotten off work. ""Bad ventilation in the mines,"" he told her. ""They sent us home early."" ""They sent the whole crew home,"" Pam Napper told CNN's Roberts. ""It scared me, because I've been raised all my life with coal mines. But you know, we've never heard of explosions and things like this, that's going on in the mines now."" In the aftermath of Monday's blast, some have pointed to numerous citations -- including some for ventilation issues -- issued to Massey Energy Co., which owns the mine. Asked if she had any questions for Massey, however, she said no. ""I just know there were things there that weren't right,"" she said, but added her brother would never have endangered her son or his son if he believed the work was unsafe. ""I think it was just a freak accident,"" she said. ""I think something just happened. I don't really know."" She is grappling with losing three members of her family. ""I've been in a coal miner family,"" she said. ""This is not the only one we've lost. We've lost younger ones, too."" Such losses are part of life in a West Virginia mining family, she said.

"Smolensk, Russia (CNN) -- When I found the first piece of fuselage, I was shocked. It was flimsy, the thin metal easily twisted back on itself. Gray on one side, some yellow on the other, it sat in a small puddle of mud a few feet from the road. I was half a mile from the runway, the tall silver birch trees nearby broken like so many matchsticks. Somehow I thought planes were supposed to be stronger than this, but what I was confronted with was an object lesson on the precarious nature of flying. The evidence of what had happened was clear. The plane struck the trees, at first just grazing their uppermost branches and then their slender boughs and trunks. It was enough to rip the plane apart. What feels almost invincible as it powers through takeoff and thrusts upward through the skies at hundreds of miles an hour had been reduced to shreds of metal, little more than a discarded tin can. These are the thoughts that flashed through my mind in those first moments of discovery. And that's when the horror of it sinks in. The last tragic moments for all aboard; it's impossible to imagine the awfulness of those final seconds. I am swept by another emotion, sadness for the families, and I feel captured by an undefined grief. I knew no one aboard, but to see how their lives ended is to know a tiny fraction of the pain their loved ones must bear. But I have come to work, to tell the story of what happened, to piece together the small bits of information we'll get, to make some sense of our corner of this huge tragedy. So that is what my team and I do. Tommy Evans, my producer, and Luis Grahame-Yool, our cameraman, get to work and set up the first live shot. It's cold in Smolensk -- there are still piles of snow here and there. None of us have had much sleep. Luis arrived 12 hours ahead of us, Tommy and I flew in from Macedonia. All of us took the 400-kilometer drive from Moscow to get here. Each of us intent on our job, each of us grappling with the enormity of the day. No day is ever normal at CNN, but this defies even that logic. A president, his wife, many of the country's top military, political and religious leaders killed in a country that's not their own. The implications could be huge. As the day wore on and more details emerged, it seemed clear Russia wanted to make it known it was not at fault. Evidence pointed toward the pilots rather than a mechanical error. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who is leading Russia's investigation, was on course to lay blame at Poland's door. He has a reputation as a tough autocrat, and it seemed to me that's what we are seeing here. But we got to see another face of Putin, too: The stony-faced solemn friend of Poland. There seemed little doubting his grief and seriousness as he stood at the foot of the Polish president's casket during the long sombre repatriation ceremony we witnessed that afternoon. Having stood among the wreckage and broken trees as he has, it is not hard to imagine that this iron man of Russian politics was moved by what he saw. For who among us, however familiar with tragedy, could fail to be touched by the scale and nature of Poland's loss.","CNN's Nic Robertson writes from scene of air crash in Russia .

"Warsaw, Poland (CNN) -- The body of Poland's first lady, Maria Kaczynska, killed with her husband in an airplane crash in Russia, returned to Warsaw on Tuesday. Crowds turned out to watch her body being driven to the presidential palace, where the couple will lie in state. The funeral for the couple will be Saturday in Warsaw, followed by their burial on Sunday in Krakow's Wawel Castle. President Barack Obama will attend the state funeral, the White House announced Tuesday in a statement. ""The president will travel to Krakow to express the depth of our condolences to an important and trusted ally, and our support for the Polish people, on behalf of the American people,"" the statement said.

Men in uniform unloaded the flag-draped casket of Kaczynska from a military plane as a band played Poland's national anthem. Family, friends and Polish officials paid their respects during a brief ceremony. Kaczynska and her husband were among 96 people killed in the crash.

Franciszek Gagor, the army chief of staff, according to Kaczynski's Law and Justice Party. The cause of the crash is being investigated. There have been questions raised over why so many of Poland's military, economic and civic leaders were aboard the same flight. Aviation officials in Russia, which has emphasized that there is no evidence it was responsible, have said the plane ignored Smolensk air traffic control commands to divert to another airport because of bad weather. Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Ivanov said Monday that flight recorders were in shape to ""conduct a detailed transcript and analysis of all flight information and the work of the plane's equipment systems up till the moment of the crash."" There is also evidence that the crew knew about the poor weather conditions and was advised to land at an alternate airfield, he said. Poland's ambassador to Moscow, Jerzy Bahr, warned against jumping to conclusions ahead of official inquiries. ""Many people think that this is something which the pilot did wrong, but it must be investigated,"" he told CNN.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Hal Holbrook has made his name playing famous historical figures. He won an Emmy for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in a 1974 TV miniseries, accolades as ""Deep Throat"" in 1976's ""All the President's Men,"" and a Tony as Mark Twain -- a performance he's been giving now for a half-century -- in ""Mark Twain Tonight!"" Hal Holbrook, 83, is nominated for his role as Ron Franz in ""Into the Wild."" But playing Ron Franz, the thoughtful, down-to-earth 81-year-old who bonds with a youthful adventurer in ""Into the Wild,"" was an opportunity he dared not miss, he says in a phone interview. ""This was an opportunity, and a rare one for me, to just play myself, to not do Abraham Lincoln or another character,"" Holbrook says in his familiar rich baritone. ""I didn't want to research anything. I had a very personal reaction to the role."" Holbrook's gut feeling has led to some of the best reviews of his career and a first for the actor: a nomination for an Academy Award. At 83 -- his birthday was last Sunday -- he's the oldest man ever to be nominated for best supporting actor. The Oscars are scheduled for Sunday night. ""Into the Wild"" is due out on video March 4. Holbrook says he's familiar with the kind of adventurousness exhibited by Christopher McCandless, played by Emile Hirsch in Sean Penn's film. Holbrook has gone into the wilderness himself. He's also sailed the open sea in a small boat, accompanied by little more than a sextant and a map. ""No electronics,"" he says. He's even traveled in McCandless' tracks, taking a trip to Alaska the year after the self-named ""Alexander Supertramp"" died. ""They were still talking about him, whether he was crazy,"" Holbrook recalls. Holbrook, who'd also read Jon Krakauer's book about McCandless' journey, says he was sent the script ""out of the blue"" and told that Penn wanted to meet with him the next day. The director, upon discussing the part with him, offered Holbrook the role. Holbrook has nothing but praise for Penn's work on the film. ""To work with Sean Penn might be the best experience I've ever had with a director,"" he says. ""He's so trusting. There was none of this 'Let's discuss the back story' -- he trusts you. He'll take whatever you give him, and begins to open up your sense of freedom. He gives you space to explore whatever the scenes bring out of you. Sean was wonderful."" Holbrook also has high praise for Hirsch, who lost 40 pounds for the role. ""[His performance] was a brilliant piece of work. ... An actor takes his performance from other actors, and in this case it was easy,"" he says, adding that ""I'm astounded he wasn't nominated -- he deserved it more than anybody."" Read Hirsch's view of ""Into the Wild."" But Holbrook also paid tribute to a person seldom considered by the audience: the film editor, in this case Jay Cassidy. By changing the sequence of two scenes, Cassidy gave the film an added power -- which made all the difference to how his performance was perceived, Holbrook says. ""I have never been more aware of an editor's genius as I have in this particular film,"" he says. Referring to the film's back-and-forth chronology, which he calls ""a very daring piece of work,"" he marvels at how Cassidy and Penn fit the pieces together. ""It's quite an achievement,"" Holbrook says. ""The effect it can have on a performance is profound."" Cassidy's work earned ""Into the Wild"" its only other Oscar nomination. Holbrook has had a busy couple months, with his performance nominated for critics' awards as well as a Screen Actors Guild Award. The activity has taken the steadily working actor away from a personal project: his memoirs. ""Trying to fit all these things in -- it ain't easy,"" he chuckles. ""I had to stop [writing] for the last month or so."" He doesn't give himself much of a possibility to win: Slim and none are my chances,"" he says. Still, he treasures the experience. The Oscar nomination ""is like a miracle,"" he says. ""After 65 years or so [of acting], to be nominated for an Academy Award is a great gift.""

"(CNN) -- Based on the hundreds of e-mails, Facebook comments and Tweets I've read in response to my denunciation of Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell's decision to honor Confederates for their involvement in the Civil War -- which was based on the desire to continue slavery -- the one consistent thing that supporters of the proclamation offer up as a defense is that these individuals were fighting for what they believed in and defending their homeland. In criticizing me for saying that celebrating the Confederates was akin to honoring Nazi soldiers for killing of Jews during the Holocaust, Rob Wagner said, ""I am simply defending the honor and dignity of men who were given no choice other than to fight, some as young as thirteen."" Sherry Callahan said that supporting the Confederacy is ""our history. Not hate; it's about heritage and history."" Javier Ramirez called slavery evil, but prefaced his remarks by saying that ""Confederate soldiers were never seen as terrorists by [President Abraham] Lincoln or U.S. generals on the battlefield. They were accorded POW status, they were never tried for war crimes. Not once did Confederate soldiers do any damage to civilians or their property in their invasion of the north. The same is not true of Union soldiers."" Realskirkland sent me a Tweet saying, ""Slavery is appalling, but was not the only reason for the CW [Civil War]. Those men, while misguided on some fronts stood up for what they felt was right. They embodied that American ideal that the states have a right to govern themselves. THAT is what a confederate soldier stood for."" If you take all of these comments, don't they sound eerily similar to what we hear today from Muslim extremists who have pledged their lives to defend the honor of Allah and to defeat the infidels in the West? When you make the argument that the South was angry with the North for ""invading"" its ""homeland,"" Osama bin Laden has said the same about U.S. soldiers being on Arab soil. He has objected to our bases in Saudi Arabia, and that's one of the reasons he has launched his jihad against us. Is there really that much of a difference between him and the Confederates? Same language; same cause; same effect. If a Confederate soldier was merely doing his job in defending his homeland, honor and heritage, what are we to say about young Muslim radicals who say the exact same thing as their rationale for strapping bombs on their bodies and blowing up cafes and buildings? If the Sons of Confederate Veterans use as a talking point the vicious manner in which people in the South were treated by the North, doesn't that sound exactly like the Taliban saying they want to kill Americans for the slaughter of innocent people in Afghanistan? Defenders of the Confederacy say that innocent people were killed in the Civil War; hasn't the same argument been presented by Muslim radicals in Iraq, Afghanistan and other places where the U.S. has tangled with terrorists? We can't on the one hand justify the actions of Confederates as being their duty as valiant men of the South, and then condemn the Muslim extremists who want to see Americans die a brutal death. These men are held up as honorable by their brethren, so why do Americans see them as different from our homegrown terrorists? The fundamental problem with extremism is that when you're on the side that is fanatical, all of your actions make sense to you, and you are fluent in trying to justify every action. Every position of those you oppose is a personal affront that calls for you to do what you think is necessary to protect yourself and your family. Just as radical Muslims have a warped sense of religion, Confederate supporters have a delusional view of what is honorable. The terrorists are willing to kill their own to prove their point, and the Confederates were just as willing in the Civil War to take up arms against their fellow Americans to justify their point. Even if you're a relative of one of the 9/11 hijackers, that man was an out-and-out terrorist, and nothing you can say will change that. And if your great-great-great-granddaddy was a Confederate who stood up for Southern ideals, he too was a terrorist. They are the same. As a matter of conscience, I will not justify, understand or accept the atrocious view of Muslim terrorists that their actions represent a just war. They are reprehensible, and their actions a sin against humanity. And I will never, under any circumstances, cast Confederates as heroic figures who should be honored and revered. No -- they were, and forever will be, domestic terrorists. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin says defenders of Confederate soldiers say they were protecting their homeland .

"(CNN) -- After actress Mackenzie Phillips spoke about her sexual relationship with her musician father, online and telephone calls to an anti-sexual assault hot line surged. Mackenzie Phillips told Larry King that incest survivors are ""incredibly underrepresented."" Her interviews in the past few weeks brought a spotlight to an uncomfortable topic. Incest, a common but highly stigmatized form of sexual abuse, often leaves the victim ashamed, isolated and unable to tell others what's happening, because the perpetrator is someone related to him or her, mental health experts said. ""For any survivor of sexual trauma, it's challenging, and it takes a lot of courage to come forward,"" said Jennifer Wilson, director of the National Sexual Assault hot line. ""With incest survivors, it's particularly difficult, because not only is there social stigma pressuring them to stay quiet, but also there's pressure that's within the family to stay quiet."" The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, which calls itself the nation's largest anti-sexual assault organization, said it had seen an 83 percent increase in activity on its online hot line and a 26 percent increase on its telephone hot line after Phillips' interview with Oprah Winfrey aired last week. ""Unfortunately, it's something we hear everyday in our hot line, so to have somebody speak aloud about it was empowering to a lot of victims and survivors who went through similar situations,"" Wilson said. Phillips spoke about the taboo nature of incest in her interview with CNN's Larry King. ""There's very little in this world that is taboo today, but this subject is still, like, shove it under the carpet, sweep it away, protect the abuser, deny the reality. ... You're just on your own,"" the former child star said. This makes it one of the most under-reported and least discussed crimes, experts said. A U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report found that of the 60,000 sexual assault cases reported in 12 states in 2000, about a quarter were perpetrated by family members. About half of the sexual assault cases with victims younger than 11 involved family members. At times, a victim may feel unable to tell other family members what's happening. And if he or she tells a relative, that family member may have ""a knee-jerk reaction,"" refusing to believe it. Relatives may try to protect the offender in order to keep the family together or to avoid the shame and stigma, Wilson said. This takes a devastating toll on a victim. ""Their sexual selves are damaged. Their emotional selves are damaged, because 'who do I trust?' "" said Debra Laino, a sex therapist and counselor. "" 'My father did this. My mother did this. Who can I trust if I can't trust my family?' "" Sometimes the reluctance to report the crime comes from the victim, because he or she doesn't want to see the family member in jail. Although Phillips called the sexual relationship with her famed father, John Phillips, ""wrong,"" she said, ""I don't want bad things to happen to him, but I also don't want bad things to happen to me as a result of this. And I was convinced to let it lie."" Her father, a co-founder of the Mamas & the Papas, died in 2001. Father- or stepfather-daughter incest is the most common form, although it also occurs between mother and child, according to the National Center for Victims of Crime. A sexual assault victim could suffer physical effects of the crime such as sexually transmitted infections, genital trauma and urinary tract infections. They could also experience many mental health effects: social withdrawal, isolation, post-traumatic stress disorder and regressive behavior such as bedwetting and thumb sucking. Some become hypersexual and engage in destructive behaviors, experts said. Humans ""have an instinct for avoiding incest or inbreeding,"" said Debra Lieberman, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Miami (Florida) who researches incest. But alcohol, drugs and mental illness may disrupt that instinct. ""Under the heavy influence of cocaine or heroin or whatever else you're taking, your mental boundaries are skewed, essentially,"" Laino said. The offender's sexual frustrations could also contribute to inappropriate actions. ""It also depends on his other mating opportunities,"" Lieberman said. ""What is the quality of his current relationship with the female's mother? Is she around? What is the ability for the guy to attract other mates?"" The perpetrator, frustrated by the absence of suitable sexual partners, may turn to whomever is around -- even if it's kin. Recovery from incest can occur, but it often takes years. A victim of incest has to understand that it's not his or her fault and get professional help, Wilson said. ""It doesn't make you broken,"" Phillips said.  ""It doesn't make it so that you can't go on and be -- once you deal with honestly and realistically what you've been through, it doesn't mean that you can't be counted on or you can't be well enough to be a part of the world.""","Actress said she had sexual relationship with her father for years .
Experts: Incest is one of the most under-reported and least discussed crimes .
Real healing after incest is possible, Phillips says ."
"(Wired.com) -- Photographers have their own version of sleight of hand. They can manipulate people, objects, landscapes and light in images, fooling lesser humans into believing the final product is a representation of reality, rather than something created by hand. In the old language, we called this ""trick photography."" Now, in the PC age, we just call it ""Photoshop."" The latest version of Photoshop, the flagship image-editing application in Adobe's Creative Suite, adds a new stack of cards to the photographer's trick deck. Wired.com was shown demos of new tools in Photoshop CS5 -- such as the new Content Aware Fill and HDR tools -- that we expect will amaze and please photographers with the tools' ability to bend pixels with absolute precision. Photoshop CS5 will arrive as part of Adobe Creative Suite 5, the company's package of 14 productivity apps for visual designers, photographers and publishers. Creative Suite 5 will ship later this month (or possibly early May) according to Adobe. Prices for the suite range between $1,300 and $2,600 depending on which package you buy, with upgrades priced between $500 and $1,500. Photoshop CS5 alone will cost $700, or $200 for an upgrade. Photoshop CS5 Extended, which has some additional tools, will cost $1,000, or $350 for an upgrade. This year marks the 20th anniversary of Photoshop's arrival, and there are certainly several ""wow"" features in Photoshop CS5 which achieve a level of technological advancement most of us couldn't have even dreamed of twenty years ago. Most impressive is the new Content Aware Fill brush, a mind-bending tool that can remove large objects from photos, altering the background to make it realistically appear as though the object was never there. It can zap tourists, delete power lines and otherwise alter photos with click-and-drag ease. This video shows it most plainly. Fast forward to about the halfway point if you want to see the really crazy stuff. (When this video first started making the rounds in March, some thought it was a hoax. It's not -- this is a real feature of Photoshop CS5.) As with any new tool in Photoshop, expect Content Aware Fill to be overused: A surfeit of tourist-free images of Machu Picchu will soon be littering Flickr. But beyond the novelty, it's a truly useful touch-up tool that turns what used to be hours of work into a simple drag of the brush. Speaking of brushes, all of the painting features in Photoshop -- neglected since the release of Photoshop 7 -- have been rewritten. The app now features much more realistic interactions. If you use a digitizer tablet, you'll find that your brushes are considerably more responsive. The angle of the stylus now controls the edge of the brush and the new paint mixing tools control color blending, wetness and bristle length, making for a very life-like painting experience. Another bit of Photoshop trickery that's become popular lately is high dynamic range imaging, or HDR. The Flickr crowd is crazy for it, and Adobe has responded by improving Photoshop's Merge to HDR tool, which helps you create HDR images. The new HDR tool now has 14 HDR presets which can save considerable effort when hand-toning an image. The HDR presets shipping with Photoshop range from the cartoonish to the fairly realistic, and should satisfy all but the pickiest of HDR enthusiasts. Composing a real HDR image requires multiple photos taken with multiple exposures, but now you can fake it. Photoshop CS5 has a new set of tools to create what Adobe calls ""single image HDRs."" The results will never quite match a true HDR with multiple images, but the new single image HDR toning dialog lets you get pretty close using just one file. Also incredibly helpful for HDR fans is the new ""remove ghosts"" tool in the HDR dialog, which makes it simple to eliminate ghosting and artifacts caused by differences between your layered HDR images. With Photoshop CS5, you can simply outline a ghosted area (say, for example, a flower that moved in the breeze between shots) and select a single layer for the portion of the image. Photoshop CS5 isn't just new brushes. There's been plenty of attention to performance -- the Mac OS X version is now fully 64-bit native, the same enhancement the Windows version got in in CS4. That means that you could, in theory, throw as much as 128 GB RAM at Photoshop. This update further deepens Photoshop's integration with Bridge, Adobe's file browsing tool. Bridge can now be embedded in a palette within Photoshop (known as Mini Bridge). You can quickly navigate through your images using the familiar Bridge interface without needing to leave Photoshop. Interestingly, the UI metaphor for Mini Bridge seems influenced by the iPhone -- when you navigate through folders, the interface slides left and right. Photoshop CS5 also gets the same massive overhaul to the Camera Raw engine that we've seen in the forthcoming Lightroom 3. Camera RAW in both apps offers much better sharpening and noise reduction, which is impressive not so much for its ability to remove noise, but to retain detail while doing so. Photoshop CS5 also has a few tricks designed to make designers' lives easier, particularly the new Puppet Warp tools, which allow you to make path-like selections and bend, warp, shorten, lengthen and twist an object. Wired.com was shown a demo by Photoshop product manager Bryan O'Neil Hughes. He took an image of an elephant with a straight trunk and, with just three selection points, he bent and curled the trunk back so the elephant appeared to be eating. Puppet Warp introduced almost no distortion into the finished image. Puppet Warp also provides a much easier and faster way to straighten tilted horizons. We were also impressed with the new Lens Correction tool, which fixes distortion and other lens artifacts using profiles tailored to correct specific camera lenses (the lens type is determined by embedded EXIF data, so Photoshop can determine that automatically). Most of the other smaller features that make this release of Photoshop a must-have are user-suggested features and workflow improvements. Adobe solicited user suggestions, filtered through the ideas, picking some three dozen ideas and making them a part of Photoshop CS5. Photoshop has several outstanding new features -- it's probably worth the price of the upgrade just for the new Content Aware Fill tool, the 64-bit boost and the improvements to Camera RAW -- but what really sells this release is amount of time it promises to save you. Among our favorites workflow improvements: You can now adjust the opacity and fill percentages on multiple layers simultaneously; the Save for Web dialog is available in 16-bit mode (and handles downsizing to 8-bit automatically); and Photoshop has the ability to save layer styles as a default behavior that even persists across sessions. Adobe has done an impressive job of focusing not just on the whiz-bang features, but on how photographers, designers and digital artists spend their time using Photoshop, and how making small changes can speed up their workflows.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq's oil minister Monday opened international bidding on six oil fields that could increase the country's oil production by 1.5 million barrels per day. Iraqi flags flutter during the opening ceremony of a new oil refinery plant in the Shiite holy city of Najaf. But the oil ministry continues to negotiate short-term no-bid contracts with several U.S. and European oil companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell, Total SA, Chevron Corp., and BP -- a step recently criticized by two U.S. lawmakers. Oil Minister Hussein Shahrastani announced Monday that 35 international oil companies can bid on long-term contracts for redeveloping the six oil fields, as well as two natural gas fields. ""It is a unique event and a significant feature in the new Iraq that we declare the first bidding course for developing the Iraq oil fields publicly and fully in a transparent way,"" the minister said at Monday's news conference. It marks the first time in more than 35 years that Iraq has allowed foreign oil companies to do business inside its borders. Shahrastani said the fee-based contracts will not give the winning companies a share in the revenue from oil sales ""because this wealth belong to Iraq only and thus we will not allow anyone to share the Iraqis' oil."" Iraq has among the largest oil reserves in the world, with an estimated 115 billion barrels -- tying Iran for the No. 2 status behind Saudi Arabia's 264 billion barrels, according to estimates from the Energy Information Administration. Iraq's current oil production is 2.25 million barrels a day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That is close to its status before the U.S.-led war that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003, but below its levels prior to the first Persian Gulf War in 1991. The six oil fields that will be open to development are in the Kirkuk oil fields and the neighboring Bai Hassan fields in northern Iraq, Shahrastani said. They are al-Rumeila, al-Zubair, al-Qurna West, and three fields in the Maysan oil fields -- Bazirqan, Abu Gharab and Fakah. The two gas fields are Akas and Mansouriya gas fields in western Iraq. The fields have already been explored and are producing oil and gas, but the equipment is old and outdated, Shahrastani said. He hopes that the new infrastructure provided by the international oil companies will mean ""the production can be increased in less cost and less time."" Iraq's oil minister said the ministry will invite the 35 qualified international companies --- which includes BP, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron -- to prepare their bids over the next two weeks. The contracts could go into effect by next year, but Shahrastani said it will take several more years before oil production is increased. ""We hope in 2013 through this first bidding course to increase production in these fields by 1.5 million barrels per day, in addition to our daily average production rate during the last five years,"" he said. Meanwhile, Iraq hopes to wrap up its talks regarding short-term, no-bid contracts that would allow the U.S. and European oil companies -- including Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total SA, Chevron, and BP -- to service those oil fields as soon as possible. Last week, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, and Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressing concerns about the no-bid contracts that the government of Iraq is negotiating with the U.S. and European companies. The senators, who released the letter, said they are worried that unfair distribution of oil revenue could inflame the violence between the warring religious and political groups of Iraq. ""We urge you to persuade the (government of Iraq) to refrain from signing contracts with multinational oil companies until a hydrocarbon law is in effect in Iraq,"" read the letter from Schumer and Kerry. ""At this time, the (government of Iraq) currently does not have in place a revenue-sharing law that could fairly allocate any revenue gained from Iraq's lucrative hydrocarbon fields between the three major ethnic groups in Iraq,"" read the letter. ""We fear that any such agreements signed by Iraq's Hydrocarbon Ministry without an equitable revenue-sharing agreement in place would simply add more fuel to Iraq's civil war."" In their letter, the senators said that Iraq's oil revenue during 2007 and 2008 will total $100 billion, ""most of which will not be spent on reconstruction due to bureaucratic incompetence."" The oil ministry said Monday that the negotiations over the no-bid ""technical support agreements"" are ongoing. Under those short-term agreements the companies would be paid a fee for extracting the oil, but would not get a share of the revenue from oil sales. The companies that will be allowed to compete in the open bidding for long-term contracts, which would be under a similar revenue format, are: .","Iraqi oil minister: 35 companies qualified to bid on service contracts for oil fields .
New contracts would raise Iraq's production by 1.5 million barrels per day .
Reduction in violence has boosted production to highest level since 2003 .

"Washington (CNN) -- A man walks through Washington's Union Station with a backpack and puts it down by a potted plant. No one notices him. He looks like any traveler. But inside his backpack are explosives. Five minutes later, a yellow Labrador retriever named Zeta enters the same crowded room, straining at her handler's leash. She has picked up the scent of black powder in the air and tracks it to the foot of the ficus tree, where she sits and waits eagerly for a reward. This is not a thwarted terrorist strike but a demonstration of what a ""vapor wake"" dog can do. For years, specially trained dogs have run their noses over objects to screen for explosives. But vapor wake dogs can detect explosives in the air despite crowds, cross-currents and other odors. Their trainers say some of the dogs have been able to enter a room and pick up the scent as much as 15 minutes after explosives have passed through. Proponents say the dogs can detect a few grams of explosives. Most are trained to recognize a dozen, but some dogs have learned as many as 20 types, including TATP, the explosive used in the London transit bombings, and ammonium nitrate, which Timothy McVeigh used to bring down the Alfred R. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. If a dog needs to learn an explosive, it can do so in one or two days. ""Technology sometimes goes bad after two, three years, and you have to get new stuff,"" said Capt. William Parker of the Amtrak Police Canine Program. ""A dog gets better as the years go on."" Parker says he is amazed by the dogs' capabilities and compares them to top athletes. ""Michael Jordan was one of the best basketball players of all time, and these vapor wake dogs I put in the same category."" At an Auburn University kennel in Anniston, Alabama, yellow Labrador retriever puppies romp and roll in a grassy pen. They have been bred for vapor wake traits, but only 1 or 2 percent of them will make the cut. Jeanne Brock, who manages the puppy program, says successful vapor wake dogs must have a strong instinct to hunt. ""They'll hunt and hunt and hunt and won't come back without it,"" Brock said. John Pearce, who developed the program, says his best dogs are friendly but not overly social. ""They could care less about being petted,"" Pearce explained. ""We are looking for a dog that is just very strong and very independent in searching, pick up air scent very easily without the direction of a handler."" At a few weeks old, the dogs are introduced to a variety of walking surfaces, like the slippery tiles they will find in a transit station. They are exposed to noises and large groups of people to make them more adaptable. Older puppies are then placed in prisons in Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama, where inmates begin teaching them to use their noses. Eventually, they come back to Auburn and undergo a training regimen that  is largely secret and is in the process of being patented. The dogs get 25 weeks of training, 14 of them with their permanent handlers. ""The dogs, when you get them, have more training than you do, and you have to play catch up,"" said Amtrak police officer Ed Ross, who works with Zeta. The U.S. Capitol Police have just started using the $20,000 vapor wake dogs. The Federal Protective Service has a few. But Amtrak Police have made them a key part of their explosive detection strategy. Parker says they provide a non-intrusive way of screening large numbers of passengers. ""You can take the dog to the situation; you don't need to take the situation to the dog,"" he said. ""They can go anywhere and adjust to the situation. They can be out in the cold. They can be out in the wind or the rain or the storm. What equipment can do that?"" Although Amtrak's dogs have hit on fertilizer, nitroglycerin pills and photo paper, which all contain the same chemicals as explosives, Parker said all the situations were quickly resolved. Rob Gillette, a veterinarian who is director of Auburn's Animal Health and Performance Program, says dogs' noses are remarkably sensitive instruments that sample the air several times a second. He compares a vapor wake dog to a chef who can discern the scent of a particular herb in a complex stew. For the dogs, Gillette says, finding explosives is simply a game: . ""At some point, this one scent comes up, and he's like 'Oh, that's the one I like! That's the one I get rewarded for! I love this, so let's go find this!'

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- In the week leading up to the meeting of world leaders in Washington, President Obama has been demonstrating a strong commitment to nuclear arms control. Last week, he signed the first major agreement with the Russians since 2002, which reduces the number of nuclear warheads and long-range missiles. Obama released the Nuclear Posture Review, saying the United States would not use nuclear weapons against countries that complied with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, even if they attacked with conventional weapons. At the same time, the president said the countries that refused to abide by the treaty could be subject to nuclear reprisal. Although Obama's Nuclear Posture Review does not go nearly as far as many of his supporters were hoping, some Republicans immediately attacked. Sens. John Kyl and John McCain warned that ""we believe that preventing nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation should begin by directly confronting the two leading proliferators and supporters of terrorism, Iran and North Korea. The Obama administration's policies, thus far, have failed to do that, and this failure has sent exactly the wrong message to other would-be proliferators and supporters of terrorism."" Some Democrats, constantly leery about appearing weak on national security, will buckle as the politics of nuclear weapons heats up when the treaty with the Russians reaches the Senate for ratification. But the administration should pursue this treaty aggressively and with confidence that they can win public opinion on this issue. The president must remind fellow Democrats, as well as Republicans, that historically the public has tended to strongly support nuclear weapons treaties, and the presidents who pursue them. After the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, President Kennedy proposed the Limited Test Ban Treaty. Proponents of a ban on atmospheric and underwater testing of nuclear weapons had unsuccessfully pushed for some kind of ban since the early 1950s. There were many powerful opponents of a treaty, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as the Republican right. In 1963, they warned that a treaty would threaten America's military strength. But Kennedy was determined to obtain a treaty. He had seen the possibility of nuclear war firsthand when the Soviets and the U.S. went eye-to-eye over missiles in Cuba. Kennedy also worried the Chinese were dangerously close to exploding their first nuclear bomb, something that also gave the Soviets an incentive to work toward some kind of treaty. Negotiations over a limited test ban took place from March to May. Conservatives warned that verification would be impossible. On June 10, in an effort to move the process forward, Kennedy made a dramatic speech at American University in which he said, ""I realize that the pursuit of peace is not as dramatic as the pursuit of war -- and frequently the words of the pursuer fall on deaf ears. But we have no more urgent task."" On August 5, 1963, the U.S., Britain and the Soviet Union reached an agreement on the Limited Test Ban Treaty that prohibited atmospheric, space and underwater testing. The administration remained nervous about whether Republicans would be able to block its ratification. But by limiting the test ban rather than agreeing to a total moratorium, Kennedy undercut the opposition. The Senate ratified the treaty 80-19. Polls showed that Americans overwhelmingly approved of the treaty. The following year, President Johnson used Sen. Barry Goldwater's opposition to the treaty as a central theme in the fall presidential campaign. Democrats broadcast a series of ads aimed at scaring the public about the possibility of nuclear war under a Goldwater presidency. Polls consistently showed that Goldwater's position on nuclear weapons was his greatest weakness. Hawkish Republican presidents have also discovered that nuclear arms reduction is popular with voters. In 1981, Ronald Reagan launched his presidency with an aggressive program that turned away from arms negotiations with the Soviet Union and insisted on the toughest terms possible before negotiations could even begin. He staffed key positions with neoconservatives who opposed negotiations with the Soviets. The administration also vastly increased defense spending. But the public was scared, and Reagan knew it. By 1983, the atmosphere was tense. Some called it the most dangerous period in the Cold War since 1962. A series of international crises, including a standoff that followed the shooting down a South Korean airliner by the Soviets, caused Reagan to see how easy it was for nuclear war to start. There was strong political pressure on the administration as well. The nuclear freeze movement, a massive international movement, was creating immense political pressure for Reagan to reverse his agenda. On television, Americans were fearful when they watched the television special ""The Day After,"" which focused on the effect of a fictional nuclear war on a small town in Kansas. One adviser warned Reagan that ""the issue in the general arena of foreign relations that could swamp us if we do not handle it with great care is the proposed freeze on the production and deployment of nuclear weapons. Even when apprised of the difficulties of the verification of this plan, 75 percent of all Americans favor the freeze."" The Strategic Defense Initiative, under which Reagan proposed to build a shield around the U.S. to protect the nation from incoming missile attack, was partially a response to his critics to show the president wanted peace as well. Reagan adopted a more conciliatory posture toward the Soviets in 1984. He delivered a widely publicized speech arguing that the Soviets and the U.S. could achieve peace. Then between 1985 and 1987, he defied the right-wing of the Republican Party -- Howard Phillips called him a ""useful idiot"" for Kremlin propaganda -- and entered into negotiations with the Soviet Union's Mikhail Gorbachev that culminated in the INF Treaty in 1987. When national security is on the table, Democrats tend to get nervous politically, particularly if they support a position that can be characterized as too dovish. But when it comes to nuclear weapons, President Obama is on a path that is politically sustainable. During the Cold War, presidents from both parties learned that the American public tends to prefer politicians who are willing to take risks to reduce nuclear stockpiles rather than those who beat the drums of war. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Barack Obama shows strong commitment to nuclear arms control, says Julian Zelizer .

"(CNN) -- Police have made an arrest in the home invasion slaying last year of a Southern California couple in their beach house, authorities said Monday. Joshua Graham Packer, 20, of Ventura is facing charges including three counts of murder and two counts of robbery, Capt. Ross Bonfiglio of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department said. Packer is accused of murdering Brock Husted, his wife, Davina Husted, and her fetus. The Husteds, who were both 42, were stabbed to death in their seaside home in Faria Beach, California, on May 20. Chief Gary Pentis of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department said it appeared the suspect targeted the victims. ""My personal opinion? This was not a random act,"" Pentis said at a news conference Monday. Until the couple's slaying, the gated community of luxury homes had not recorded a homicide in 15 years, police said. According to investigators, the Husteds were home with their two young children on the night of the slaying. Their daughter was asleep in bed, and their son was watching ""American Idol"" in the living room. About 10:30 p.m., the suspect entered the home through French doors that face the ocean, police said. The killer was dressed in dark clothing and wore a motorcycle helmet, authorities said. He walked past the child who was watching television and stabbed the Husteds. Davina Husted was four months pregnant. The home was not ransacked, and the alleged murder weapon was left at the scene, Bonfiglio said. A sample of Packer's DNA taken after an arrest in Santa Barbara matched the genetic material found at the Husted crime scene, said Pentis the sheriff's department chief. He added that items from the victims' house were found at the suspect's home. Scott Husted, the brother of Brock Husted, thanked the sheriff's department for solving the killings. ""This is a milestone, a very huge milestone in this process,"" he said. ""We're very grateful for the work the Ventura County sheriff's department has put in this case."" ""This in no way takes away the loss our family has had. Brock was our baby brother."" Packer is being held on $2.2 million bail at the Ventura County Main Jail.","20-year-old Joshua Packer arrested in stabbing deaths .

"Naoma, West Virginia (CNN) -- West Virginia's governor on Tuesday named a former head of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration to lead a state investigation into last week's coal mine explosion that left 29 miners dead. Davitt McAteer has overseen investigations into two previous mine accidents, the Sago disaster that killed 12 miners in 2006 and the fire at the Aracoma Alma No. 2 mine that left two workers dead. The West Virginia native served as the Clinton administration's assistant labor secretary for mine safety in the 1990s and is vice president of Wheeling Jesuit University. ""Davitt has the experience and knowledge to lead what will be a complex and extensive investigation into this horrible accident,"" Gov. Joe Manchin said in announcing McAteer's appointment. ""We made tremendous progress in 2006 immediately following the Sago and Aracoma accidents, and I fully expect that we will learn even more from this and make dramatic changes to protect our miners."" The last bodies were recovered early Tuesday from the Upper Big Branch mine, the scene of the fatal explosion April 5. McAteer was critical of the mine's owner, Virginia-based Massey Energy, in the days after the blast. ""Some companies, and this appears to be one, take the approach that these violations are simply a cost of doing business -- it's cheaper for us to mine in an unsafe way or in a way that risks people's lives than it is for us to comply with the statutes, comply with the laws,"" McAteer said last week. There was no immediate response from Massey Energy to McAteer's appointment, but Massey CEO Don Blankenship said last week that its safety history is among the best in the industry. The Montcoal, West Virginia, mine received 458 citations from federal inspectors in 2009, and more than 50 of those were for problems that the operators knew about but had not corrected, according to federal mine safety records. Inspectors cited the operators more than 100 times in the first quarter of 2010, including six times for ""unwarrantable failure"" to correct violations. Massey subsidiary Aracoma Coal pleaded guilty to 10 criminal charges and paid a record $4.2 million in fines and civil penalties in connection with the January 2006 fire that McAteer investigated. Manchin said the state owes an explanation for last week's disaster to the families of the men who died in the Upper Big Branch mine, ""And we owe it to them and every coal miner working today to do everything humanly possible to prevent this from happening again."" Managers of two pension funds have called on Massey's board to oust Blankenship, who has been critical of mining regulations in the past. ""Massey's cavalier attitude toward risk and callous disregard for the safety of its employees has exacted a horrible cost on dozens of hard-working miners and their loved ones,"" New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in a written statement Monday. He said Blankenship ""must step down and make room for more responsible leadership at Massey."" New York's state pension fund, which DiNapoli manages, has about $14 million worth of Massey stock -- a tiny fraction of the company's estimated $4.3 billion market capitalization. But his call was echoed by the CtW Investment Group, which manages pension funds for about 6 million union workers. CtW blamed Blankenship's ""confrontational approach to regulatory compliance"" and the failure of the company's board of directors to challenge him for the disaster. ""Under Chairman and CEO Blankenship's domineering leadership, Massey Energy placed short-term production and profit goals ahead of prudent risk management, with devastating consequences for the corporation, its shareholders and employees,"" the fund wrote in a letter to the board. ""In light of these consequences, the urgent need for new leadership is apparent."" The company has not commented on calls for Blankeship's ouster, but said safety ""has been and will continue to be our top priority every day."" ""We do not condone any violation of Mine Safety and Health Administration regulations, and we strive to be in compliance with all regulations at all times,"" it said in a written statement last week. Bodies of the remaining victims were removed overnight, said Jama Jarrett, spokeswoman for the West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training. The bodies of seven victims had been recovered shortly after the explosion, and 13 bodies were removed Sunday. Until Sunday, U.S. flags on all federal buildings in the state will be kept at half-staff per a proclamation that President Obama signed on Monday. The mining disaster was the worst in the United States since 1972, when 91 miners died in a fire at the Sunshine Mine in Kellogg, Idaho.

"Warsaw, Poland (CNN) -- The body of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, who was killed in a plane crash in Russia over the weekend, returned to tributes in his homeland Sunday afternoon. Soldiers in perfect step carried the casket from the plane that transported onto the tarmac, where mourners were waiting. Catholic priests recited prayers at the military airport before Kaczynski's daughter and twin brother, followed by others, took turns kneeling before the flag-draped casket. People lined up along the streets along where Kaczynski's body would pass on its way to the presidential palace. Tens of thousands of Poles across the country observed a two-minute-long moment of silence to remember their president and 95 others killed in the plane crash. iReport: Mourners' candles a 'spot of light' Meanwhile, investigators said they found the aircraft's flight data recorders in good condition and began deciphering them Sunday, the independent Russian Interfax news agency reported. Residents flocked to central Warsaw, the site of the presidential palace, to mourn Kaczynski. They left wreaths and lit candles. By Sunday, the numbers grew to about 100,000 by some estimates. Many cried openly. Others stared blankly at the sky. On Monday, the country begins a week-long period of mourning. The plane carrying Kaczynski crashed Saturday morning while trying to land at an airport near Smolensk in Russia. Biography: Lech Kaczynski . Kaczynski's wife and several top military officials were also killed in the crash. Parliament Speaker Bronislaw Komorowski took over as acting president and declared it ""a time for national mourning."" Kaczynski, 60, had been traveling with a Polish delegation to Russia for the 70th anniversary of the Russian massacre of Polish prisoners of war in the village of Katyn. About 20,000 Poles, including soldiers and civilians, were executed there during World War II. The Polish military plane carrying Kaczynski originated in Warsaw, the Polish Defense Ministry said. It was just a few miles east of Katyn when it crashed around 10:50 a.m. (2:50 a.m. ET) on the outskirts of the town of Pechorsk, close to Smolensk, the Investigation Committee of the Russian prosecutor's office said. World leaders pay tribute to Kaczynski . Late Saturday night, Kaczynski's twin brother, Jaroslaw, visited the site of the crash. As others around him prayed, he silently knelt down on pile of rubble where mourners had propped up flowers. Authorities do not yet know what caused the crash. Russia has emphasized that there is no evidence it was responsible. The Investigation Committee said the plane, a Tupolev-154, was trying to land in heavy fog. A Russian military official said that air traffic control in Smolensk had tried to divert the plane to another airport because of inclement weather. ""The air traffic control officer gave several orders to divert but the plane continued with its descent,"" said Alexander Aleshin, a top Russian air force official. ""Unfortunately, this ended in tragedy."" Russian President Dmitry Medvedev appointed Putin to head an inquiry commission. On Sunday, the Russian state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported that the crash was not caused by technical problems, citing investigation officials. The plane carrying Kaczynski was refurbished and repaired last year, according to Alexei Gusev, general director of Aviakor Factory, the company that performed the service. ""Speaking openly, we believe that this tragedy could not have been caused by equipment failure,"" he said. Kaczynski had been president since December 2005, after he defeated rival Donald Tusk in the second round of voting. Elections must now be held within 60 days. Other Polish officials killed in the crash include Aleksander Szczyglo, the head of the National Security Office; Jerzy Szmajdzinski, the deputy parliament speaker; Andrzej Kremer, the deputy foreign minister; and Gen. Franciszek Gagor, the army chief of staff, according to Kaczynski's Law and Justice Party. What does crash mean for Polish politics? The party also said that Slawomir Skrzypek, head of the National Bank of Poland, was killed. Putin spoke Saturday at the crash site, where charred pieces of the airplane were strewn through a wooded area. Some pieces, including one of the wheel wells, were upside down. ""As our first priority, we must establish the causes of this tragedy,"" he said. ""As a second priority, we must do everything in our power to assist the families and relatives of the deceased.""

"(CNN)  -- A Navy training jet crashed in a north Georgia forest on Monday, killing at least three people aboard and setting more than 10 acres of woodland ablaze, local and federal authorities said. A fourth person aboard the jet was unaccounted for Monday night, said Harry White, spokesman for the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida. The cause of the crash was under investigation. FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said the crash of the twin-engine T-39N trainer caused no injuries on the ground. It went down just north of Morganton, Georgia, about 80 miles north of Atlanta, Fannin County Sheriff's Maj. Keith Bosen said. ""We got reports that it was flying pretty low,"" Bosen said. The plane had flown north-northeast over the nearby town of Blue Ridge before it went down about 4:40 p.m., he said. The mountainous area is ringed by national forest land, and the crash set the surrounding woods on fire. ""We have about a 10- to 15-acre fire still working at this time,"" Bosen said. The T-39N took off from Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida, about 400 miles south of Morganton, Bergen said. The jet is a military version of Rockwell's twin-engine Saberliner executive aircraft.

"(CNN) -- Jurors in Portland, Oregon, awarded a former Boy Scout $1.4 million after finding Tuesday that the organization was negligent in allowing a Scout leader who was a sex offender to have contact with him. The three-week trial ended with Multnomah County Circuit Court Judge John A. Wittmayer polling the jurors, who confirmed they had found the negligence contributed to damage to the plaintiff as claimed. The jury ruled that the plaintiff is also entitled to punitive damages. That's to be determined beginning Tuesday in the trial's second phase. How the Scouts handled the case of the former Scout leader, Timur Dykes, was at the center of the explosive lawsuit. Attorney Kelly Clark, who has been representing six men suing the Scouts, would not discuss the case until after the punitive phase. Before the trial, he alleged that when his clients were boys during the 1980s, the organization knew that at least one of them had been abused by Dykes. He also alleged that though Dykes was removed as a Scout leader, he was allowed to stay on as a volunteer and the abuse continued. CNN was not able to reach Dykes. Clark produced documents that he said were part of an archive of previously secret Boy Scout files that chronicled decades of abuse of boys. The Scouts' lawyers said the organization had not known about Dykes' record nor had it known about an outstanding warrant at the time. Once the Scouts did learn about it, the organization acted immediately and cooperated with police, the Scouts' lawyers said. A Boy Scouts spokesman has acknowledged the organization does have confidential files, but said they are made confidential in order to protect people who are ineligible to be Scout leaders but who may not have done anything illegal. A Scouts spokesman said that, in recent years, the organization has taken extensive measures to keep abusers out. In a written statement, the Scouts said the organization intends to appeal. ""We are gravely disappointed with the verdict,"" it said. ""We believe that the allegations made against our youth protection efforts are not valid."" It added, ""We are saddened by what happened to the plaintiff. The actions of the man who committed these crimes do not represent the values and ideals of the Boy Scouts of America. ""The safety of the young people currently in the Scouting program has never been in question during these legal proceedings. The case focused on a discussion about what society and the BSA knew about child abuse approximately three decades ago. ""This is a long-standing societal issue that every youth-serving organization must address. Based on the standard of care of that time, the BSA believes it acted responsibly and that the evidence presented during the trial does not justify the verdict."" While holding the Boy Scouts of America 60 percent negligent, the jury said the Cascade Pacific Council -- which oversees Scouting activities in the region -- was 15 percent negligent and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints 25 percent negligent. The church has sponsored a number of Boy Scout troops, including the one to which the plaintiff belonged. Steve English, a lawyer representing the church, said Tuesday's verdict has no impact on the church, since it settled the case out of court more than a year ago. ""The church absolutely condemns any kind of child abuse,"" he said. ""Because of the way the law is set up in Oregon, we thought it made sense both to help the victim and also to get this behind the victim and us to settle this case.""

"(CNN) -- The late country music icon Hank Williams was among the 2010 Pulitzer Prize winners announced Monday. The Pulitzer Prize Board awarded a posthumous special award to Williams, who died in 1953 at 29, for his lifetime achievement as a musician, praising the country legend for ""his craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life."" The board, chaired by Miami Herald Executive Editor Anders Gyllenhaal, decided on the ""special citation"" after a confidential survey of experts in popular music. ""The citation, above all, recognizes the lasting impact of Williams as a creative force that influenced a wide range of other musicians and performers,"" said Sig Gissler, administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes, in a statement. ""At the same time, the award highlights the board's desire to broaden its Music Prize and recognize the full range of musical excellence that might not have been considered in the past."" Only a few other musicians have earned special citations in music in recent years: jazz composers Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane each received one in 2006 and 2007, respectively, and Bob Dylan captured one in 2008. Williams set the country music standard with his music, including songs such as, ""Your Cheatin' Heart,"" ""Cold Cold Heart,"" ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" and ""Jambalaya."" In the reporting categories, which make up the bulk of the Pulitzer awards, The Washington Post racked up four awards in a wide range of categories -- feature writing, commentary, criticism and international reporting. The latter was awarded for journalist Anthony Shadid's series on Iraq as the United States started the troop withdrawal, leaving local leaders to ""struggle to deal with the legacy of war and to shape the nation's future."" The New York Times won the award for explanatory reporting for a detailed account of contaminated beef and other food safety issues, pointing out defects in defects in federal regulations. The Times also won the national reporting category for stories on the hazardous use of cell phones and other devices while driving. The highly coveted Pulitzer for investigative reporting was awarded to Barbara Laker and Wendy Ruderman of the Philadelphia Daily News and Sheri Fink, a reporter for the nonprofit, ProPublica investigative Web site, for their 13,000-word story, ""The Deadly Choices at Memorial,"" which chronicled how some New Orleans doctors made urgent life-and-death decisions after being cut off by Hurricane Katrina's floodwaters. The story was published in collaboration with the New York Times Magazine. The win by the 2-year-old Web site marked a significant moment for the Pulitzer board, which has traditionally awarded such honors to newspapers and wire services. Other journalism categories were won by the Bristol (Virginia) Herald Courier for public service reporting; The Seattle Times for breaking news reporting; The Dallas Morning News for editorial writing; syndicated cartoonist Mark Fiore for editorial cartooning; The Des Moines Register for breaking news photography; and The Denver Post for feature photography. Fiore's animated cartoons appeared on SFGate.com, the Web site of the San Francisco Chronicle, had ""biting wit"" and reflected extensive research as well as his ability to ""distill complex issues,"" the board said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Another massive snowstorm barreled into the mid-Atlantic region Tuesday, as residents still reeling from a paralyzing weekend blizzard faced more of the same. Hundreds of flights were canceled, and airlines were waiting to see whether they would have to cancel more. No flights were expected to be operating Wednesday at Reagan National Airport or at Washington Dulles International, the Washington Airports Authority said. Federal workers and schoolchildren in the nation's capital were told to stay home for a second consecutive day. The National Weather Service predicted another 10 to 20 inches of snow for northern Virginia, eastern Maryland and Washington beginning Tuesday afternoon and continuing through Wednesday. In last weekend's blizzard, a record 32.4 inches of snow fell on Washington's Dulles International Airport over two days, breaking the January 7-8, 1996, record of 23.2 inches. Are you there? Share your winter weather photos, video . If as severe as predicted, the new storm will be the third major snowfall to hit the nation's capital and surrounding region in slightly more than seven weeks. In Washington on Tuesday, out-of-towners Susan Martin and Robert Travers told CNN affiliate WJLA they had just flown to the city for a conference, but learned when they arrived that the conference had been canceled. Flights that would take them home from Reagan National Airport had been canceled, too. ""We probably won't get a flight back out of here until Thursday. That's what they're telling us,"" Martin told WJLA. WJLA.com: People stranded at Washington airports, train stations . It was not expected to begin snowing in some areas until Tuesday night or Wednesday. Forecasters said Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, could be slammed with 3 to 7 inches Tuesday and an additional 8 to 12 inches on Wednesday; Washington, 4 to 8 inches on Tuesday night and another 3 to 7 inches Wednesday; 5 to 8 inches Tuesday and 3 to 5 on Wednesday in Boston, Massachusetts; and 2 to 4 inches Tuesday and 6 to 10 inches Wednesday in New York. Snow coverage from CNN affiliate WBAL . Delays of 30 minutes were reported for some flights at Chicago, Illinois', O'Hare International Airport, where more than 600 flights were canceled. Most of the flights at Midway Airport also were canceled, according to Gregg Cunningham, spokesman for the Chicago Department of Aviation. Southwest Airlines was expecting to resume its normal schedule Wednesday at 10:30 a.m., he said. Travelers should confirm the status of their flights by checking their airline's Web site before departing for the airport, he advised. Delta Air Lines canceled 375 flights, including regional flights, in various locations Tuesday, spokesman Anthony Black said. He said a decision would be made Tuesday evening on any Wednesday cancellations. American Airlines canceled 80 flights into and out of Washington and Philadelphia, spokesman Tim Wagner said. American and Delta said they had pre-emptively canceled 120 flights for Wednesday for both cities. US Airways canceled 135 mainline flights and 307 US Airways Express flights systemwide, spokesman Andrew Christie said. He said the airline has canceled 380 mainline flights and 1,042 US Airways Express flights. Snow causes more headaches for travelers . The storms were taking a financial toll on local governments. Alexandria, Virginia, spent more than $1 million for the massive snowstorm that hit the region in December, budget analyst Morgan Routt said, and the city was still cleaning up after last weekend's storm. ""So, you can imagine, that's costing even more,"" he said. ""We've had people working around the clock."" The city, whose fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30, generally budgets $790,000 annually for snow removal. That covers the costs of equipment, personnel, contractors, materials and supplies. For the 2009 year ending in July, Routt said, the city spent only $485,000. Part of this year's costs are reimbursable by the federal government because the governor declared a snow emergency, he added. All Washington National Guard full-time personnel were asked to report for duty Tuesday morning and expect to stay for two or three nights, helping with emergency response operations.

"(CNN) -- Manchester City misfit Robinho made a winning second debut for Santos as he scored the decisive goal in a 2-1 victory against Brazilian rivals Sao Paulo on Sunday. The Brazil forward has returned home in a loan deal in order to boost his hopes of playing at the World Cup finals in South Africa in June, having struggled to win a first-team place with his English club this season. The 26-year-old, who cost big-spending City a club-record $52.4 million when he agreed to leave Spanish giants Real Madrid in a shock deal right at the end of the August 2008 transfer window, started his career with Santos eight years ago. He came off the bench 12 minutes into the second half at Sao Paulo's Morumbi ground, and netted the winner with just five minutes to play with a clever backheel at the near post from Wesley's cross. The victory lifted Santos to the top of the Sao Paulo state Campeonato Paulista Championship above their opponents. Teenage striker Neymar went to the top of the league's goalscoring charts after putting Santos ahead with a penalty seven minutes before halftime after Arouca was fouled by Miranda, his seventh strike this season. Roger leveled the score 10 minutes after Robinho came on with a header from Marcelino Paraiba's cross, but the City star settled the outcome in the 85th minute as he caught out goalkeeper Rogerio Ceni with his improvised finish. Brazil's nationwide league begins in May, with Santos finishing 12th of 20 teams last season, 18 points behind champions Flamengo.","Manchester City misfit Robinho makes a winning second debut for Santos .

"Carnes, Mississippi (CNN)  -- The deaths of two Mississippi teens are about to put a national focus on a little-recognized problem. Devon Byrd, 16, and Wade White, 18, were killed when a natural gas tank at a well production site exploded last fall in Carnes, in southern Mississippi. Local teenagers said the site is a popular hangout because it's quiet and secluded. But the dead teens' parents say the explosion could have been prevented if some warning signs had been posted -- ""something simple as fences, gates and signs, probably very inexpensive, and certainly a lot less expensive that what a child's life is worth,"" said White's father, Phillip. Police say they don't know exactly what ignited flammable vapors inside the tank. When it exploded, the teenagers were killed instantly. Their bodies were found about 40 yards from the tank's base; the tank landed another 20 yards from them. Investigators say they found a lighter, but don't know whether it was involved. ""I couldn't believe that my child was gone,"" White's mother, Wanda, told CNN. The White and Byrd families have an ally in their camp. The Chemical Safety Board, created by Congress, investigated the accident and found at least 40 other deaths involving oil and gas wells in the past 25 years. Most of them involved young people. The CSB says it found a patchwork of laws nationwide that don't uniformly address security around oil and gas wells. It's asking the industry to police itself by voluntarily installing fences and warning signs. ""If these tanks are sitting out there in the middle of nowhere, no protection around them, no warning, they are just an accident waiting to happen,"" CSB Chairman John Bresland told CNN. Delphi Oil, the company that owns the tank that blew up, told CNN it could not discuss the accident because of pending negligence lawsuits filed by the families. A spokesman called the boys' deaths tragic, but the company says it is complying with all rules. However, authorities tell CNN there are no state regulations requiring locked gates or no-smoking signs. ""He may be in compliance,"" Forrest County Sheriff Billy McGee told CNN. ""But there's nothing in the rules for him to be in compliance with."" Carnes is about 40 miles north of the Gulf Coast. In nearby Laurel, city zoning laws require oil and gas tanks to be fenced in with warning signs, according to Emergency Management District Executive Director Terry Steed. The CSB asked family and friends of Byrd and White to help them make an educational video about the dangers of oil and gas production sites. It's called ""No Place to Hang Out,"" and it's part of a national campaign starting this week to teach young people about the potential danger of tanks. But it also urges the industry to improve itself. ""There's nothing we can do to bring Devon and Wade back, "" said White's girlfriend, Maria Thompson, 16. ""But if it can save someone else's life, I'd like to see it happen."" ""Like McDonalds,"" added another friend, Shawn Ashlee Davis. ""They have to put 'Caution. This coffee's hot' (on their cups). I really think they need signs warning 'This is a dangerous place.' "" Mississippi state Sen. Billy Hudson told CNN he plans to introduce a state law requiring barbed-wire-topped fences, locked gates and ""Danger - Keep Out"" signs. ""There's no guarantees,"" Hudson said. ""You could cut the fence with a bolt cutter, or you can shoot off a lock. But it'll be a deterrent, and it's a step in the right direction."" White's father says his son would be proud that friends and family are speaking out: ""He'd be proud that we're trying to do something to keep other kids and other families from going through what we're going through.""","Two Mississippi teens killed when natural gas tank at well production site exploded .

"Washington (CNN) -- Remembering Wilma Mankiller, who died this week, isn't hard, because first of all, who can forget a name like that? Wilma Pearl Mankiller. What a perfect name. Perfect, that is, after you've won two terms as leader of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and a Presidential Medal of Freedom, traveled the world, acquired celebrity friends like Gloria Steinem and become one of the most famous American Indians on the planet. Not so perfect in 1969, when you're 25 years old and a soon-to-be-divorced mother of two living in San Francisco. Try making a dentist appointment with a name like Mankiller or Crow Dog or Pretty Shield: half the time people would think it's a crank call and hang up on you. But that was the least of her problems. Wilma Mankiller's biggest problem was being an Indian in 1969. We were so square, and so invisible. Why was she in San Francisco then, instead of Oklahoma? She had moved there with her family (she was one of 11 children) because the United States said there wasn't any future in Indians living on reservations. So it began a program imaginatively called Urban Indian Relocation, which moved Indians to cities. It wasn't a terrible idea, just a bad one, at least for most Indians. Was life better in Cleveland or Dallas or San Francisco than life in Mescalero, Tahlequah, or Wanblee? Sometimes yes, usually no. The thing is, it wasn't clear where any of this was going. What was even the point of being Indian, anyway? Why can't there be a future back home? Why is being an unemployed aerospace worker in California better than being unemployed in Montana? Mankiller may have been pondering these questions when something amazing happened. In a daring nighttime invasion, a few dozen Indian college students took over the abandoned federal prison on Alcatraz Island and reclaimed it on behalf of a group they had just invented, called Indians of All Tribes. This was electrifying because Indians in those days did not stage daring nighttime invasions and break laws and trespass on federal property -- any property, for that matter. That occupation of Alcatraz in November 1969 lasted for 19 months. Mankiller visited the ragtag settlement frequently, and said it changed her life. She wasn't the only one. I moved to San Francisco in 1977, and met Mankiller and other ""veterans"" of Alcatraz. The occupation was endlessly debated -- so many good and bad things happened during those months -- but nobody argued how important it was, and how much had changed. We weren't so boring, and we were becoming visible. More than anything else, Alcatraz signaled new possibilities. Wilma Mankiller saw them clearly and seized every one. She finished college, divorced, moved with her two daughters back to Oklahoma, and began her own series of audacious takeovers: running and revolutionizing community development projects for the tribe, then successfully running for principal chief of the Cherokee Nation. She served two terms and became an icon. Just like Alcatraz, none of this was supposed to happen. Did I mention she was a woman? We Indians in the U.S. talk a good game about being matriarchal and so forth, but it was no accident that in the 20th century no woman had lead a major tribe before her. (The unofficial logo of the American Indian Movement was the Playboy bunny. Ha ha!) So she had no chance to lead her Nation, but did so anyway. The other reason none of this was suppose to happen is her near-fatal car crash in 1979, her kidney transplant, her battles with breast cancer, lymphoma, and numerous operations. She beat them all -- all except pancreatic cancer. The health disasters were horrible and unrelenting, but I bet you dollars to donuts Mankiller would tell you it wasn't nearly as bad as the tribal politics. Alcatraz feels like a million years ago. We have profitable Indian casinos and a Smithsonian museum and many strong women leading our tribes and communities. Indian college students are getting Ph.D.'s instead of criminal records. Some people, including me, wonder if we've lost the kind of daring that would lead college kids to break into an abandoned prison seeking some kind of justice, and a woman to find a calling there that would change a piece of the world. And this is where I write she was tough as nails and one of a kind, and we won't see the likes of her ever again. It's all true, but there's something more. Her life made a new future possible one that is still unwritten. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Chaat Smith.","Paul Chaat Smith says Wilma Mankiller was one of the most accomplished, famous Indians .

"LONDON, England  -- UEFA banned Poland's Legia Warsaw from European competition for two seasons on Wednesday in response to ""ugly and shocking"" crowd scenes during an Intertoto Cup match. Police horses have to disperse the crowd during Sunday's unsavory scenes. UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Body announced that Legia would be thrown out of this season's competition and also barred from an additional European campaign should they qualify within the next five years. Legia were trailing 2-0 away to Lithuanian team Vetra Vilnius in Sunday's second round, first leg match when Polish fans embarked on a halftime rampage, attacking police with metal bars and stones and causing damage to the stadium. European football's governing body said the abandoned match would be turned into a 3-0 victory for Vetra who will go on to face English side Blackburn Rovers in the third round. Legia have also been ordered by to arrange compensation with Vetra in regard to the stadium damage. Although Legia have promised to crack down on fans involved in Sunday's violence, the disciplinary body noted that this was not the first time it had dealt with the Polish club. The latest incidents occurred just 10 weeks after Poland were awarded the right by UEFA to co-host the 2012 European championship finals with Ukraine. ""Legia must react quickly and firmly if the club wishes to participate in UEFA competition in future,"" the disciplinary body concluded. ""With Legia's considerable disciplinary record for away matches, the duty of playing matches against Legia becomes a tall order that UEFA cannot afford to support any longer."" The club has until Saturday to appeal against the UEFA decision. E-mail to a friend .","Legia Warsaw are thrown out of Intertoto Cup after crowd trouble .

"(CNN) -- As Tax Day approaches, Tea Party activists are uniting to voice the message they've been honing for more than a year: It's time to reduce the size of government, honor the Constitution and return to fiscal responsibility in Washington. The Tea Party Express' third cross-country tour brings activists to Boston, Massachusetts, on Wednesday, before culminating with an anti-tax rally at the nation's capital on Thursday. The ""Just Vote Them Out!"" tour has weaved through areas represented by vulnerable Democrats, bringing thousands to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's hometown in Nevada on its opening day. The tour's other top target -- Democratic Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan -- announced his retirement the same day the tour was in his turf. Tea Party favorite Sarah Palin was the top draw at the Boston event. Republican Sen. Scott Brown, whose winning Massachusetts campaign was infused by the Tea Party, turned down his invitation to the event, although his office said he wished the rally success. Are you at a Tea Party rally? Share your images . So far, the movement's success is in the eye of the beholder. Tea Party activists running for office have yet to make much impact in the Republican primaries, and Stupak rejected the notion that the Tea Party played a role in his decision to step down. Tea Party changes tone, not outcome of Texas primary . But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer admitted Tuesday that the protests and rallies by the Tea Party across the country are having an impact on lawmakers' decisions about running for another term. ""Do I think that negative atmosphere that's been created by the Tea Party and by others certainly goes into the thinking of members? I think it does. I think you honestly have to point out that it does,"" Hoyer said. Hoyer: Tea Party having an impact . The Tea Party developed last year in protest to what its supporters saw as overspending in Washington -- by Republicans and Democrats -- following the stimulus bill, the bank bailouts and President Obama's budget. Fueled by anger at the government and fear of where the country was headed, it grew from dozens to hundreds of loosely linked groups. Until recently, there had been little movement toward coalescing as a formal party. Last week, a broad coalition of national and regional Tea Party groups announced the formation of the National Tea Party Federation. Tea Party movement attempts to unite? Tom De Luca, a professor of political science at Fordham University, said while Tea Party activists have affected the national agenda, the larger impact has been on the Republican Party. ""It's energized the hardcore base of Republicans who tend to share a lot of Tea Party ideas, but on the other hand, it's going to bring to the floor a split that has been in the Republican Party for quite a long time,"" De Luca said. That split pits the more conservative elements of the party against moderate Republicans. At the Southern Republican Leadership Conference last weekend, a Tea Party member voiced a concern to former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum that the moderate Republicans -- and not conservatives -- would end up on the ballot in November. ""Go beat them,"" he told the attendee. ""That's what elections are all about. I encourage candidates to run,"" Santorum said, adding the GOP must focus its energy on electing conservative candidates in the Republican primaries. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, said last week that the Republican Party and the Tea Party are in the process of merging. Bachmann: GOP and Tea Party movement are 'merging' If the Tea Party pushes Republicans further to the right, however, it could hurt them in November, De Luca noted. Centrist voters would likely favor a Democrat over a far-right Republican, he said. Republican Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour pleaded with conservatives at the conference to stick together as the elections near. ""The Democrats' fondest hope is to see Tea Party or other conservatives split off and have a third party to split the conservative vote,"" he said. ""We can't let that happen. We've got to stay unified."" De Luca said the Republican Party now finds itself trying to navigate the movement. ""They want to incorporate it to the degree they can without hurting the party's chances,"" he said. As for Tea Party members, they want to hold lawmakers' feet to the fire without being swallowed up by a party some fear is trying to Astroturf their grassroots movement. ""I got more knife wounds in my back from Republican operatives than Democrats could ever do,"" said Mark Williams, chairman of the Tea Party Express III tour. ""The Democrats at least stand there and tell me they hate me, and tell me that they hate America. These Republicans smile at me, shake my hand and then stab me in the back."" The Tea Party Express is run from the same building as a Republican political consulting firm. Joe Wierzbicki, who coordinates the Tea Party Express, told CNN earlier this year that the people who run the movement ""need a major political party."" ""I think what you'll find is at Tea Party rallies, a lot of those people who are mad at the Republican Party, many of them are Republicans themselves. Us included,"" he said. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted earlier this year indicates Tea Party activists would vote overwhelmingly Republican in a two-party race for Congress. The poll also found that activists in the Tea Party movement tend to be male, upscale and overwhelmingly conservative. Roughly 11 percent of all Americans say they have actively supported the Tea Party movement. Of this core group of activists, half live in rural areas. ""It seems to have captured the attention of a certain, very large and important segment, but still -- a certain segment of society,"" De Luca said. ""Its lasting power is someone questionable."" What remains to be seen is how closely the movement allies itself with the GOP, to what extent the various Tea Party groups come together as a formal organization and whether the activists solidify around a more coherent message removed from vitriolic embellishments and not grounded in fear, De Luca said. ""What will happen to them if the economy improves? What will happen to them if the health care plan starts to work? What happens to this extreme message if things turn in ways that no longer enflame all of these doubts many people have about who they are as Americans, but starts to reassure them that America is moving in a better direction?"" he asked. But at least for now, the movement's focus remains on cleaning house, Williams said. ""We're in a war for the soul of this country,"" he said. ""We need to purge both parties. We need to purge the Democrats of the Marxists and the Republicans of the weaklings."" CNN's Jim Acosta, Paul Steinhauser, Shannon Travis and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","Tea Party Express winds up tour Wednesday in Boston, Thursday in D.C.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona took a giant stride towards retaining their Spanish league title with a 2-0 win over arch-rivals Real Madrid in Saturday's 'El Clasico' at the Santiago Bernabeu to go three points clear at the top of La Liga. Lionel Messi continued his remarkable scoring streak with his 40th of the season and 27th in the league in the first half with Pedro Rodriquez adding the second after the break. The devastating defeat ended Real's 12-match winning streak in La Liga and was their first at home at a decisive stage of the season with seven games to go. Messi broke the deadlock just after the half-hour mark as he was set up by a clever chipped pass from the irrepressible Xavi and turned Raul Albiol to beat Iker Casillas with ease. Messi's predecessor as World Footballer of the Year, Cristiano Ronaldo, could make little impression for Real who were struggling to create chances in front of their home fans. A Marcelo shot just after the break finally gave Victor Valdes some work in the Barca goal, but last year's triple winners were soon two-up with Xavi again the creator. His pin-point pass found Pedro in the clear and his cleverly beat the advancing Casillas for the decisive second. It finally sparked a Real reaction and Valdes had to save smartly from Rafael Van der Vaart before Ronaldo twice tested him. With Real pushing forward it was almost inevitable that Barca would have opportunities on the break and Messi wasted a chance when put through with only Casillas to beat, the Spanish international goalkeeper making a fine save. In the 77th minute, Casillas again came to the rescue after Xavi played in Messi again. Raul had the ball in the net for Real in the final frantic moments but it was chalked off for a handball by Karim Benzema and Barca held on for a deserved three points to cap a superb week which has seen them reach the Champions League semifinals where they will face Inter Milan. Inter were also in action in the Italian League on Saturday, held to a disappointing 2-2 draw by Fiorentina. Keirrison put Fiorentina ahead in the 11th minute but Jose Mourinho's men then took apparent control through Diego Milito (75) and Samuel Eto'o (81). But Per Kroldrup equalized for the Viola a minute later to leave Inter two points clear of Roma who can top them on Sunday with a win against Atalanta.","Barcelona beat Real Madrid 2-0 in the Bernabeu to go three points clear in Spain .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Lend us your ears and follow your nose. This broadcast of CNN Student News appeals to the senses. From the CNN Center, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Nuclear Summit . U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Two decades after the end of the Cold War, we face a cruel irony of history. The risk of a nuclear confrontation between nations has gone down, but the risk of nuclear attack has gone up. AZUZ: The risk that President Obama is talking about is from terrorists. This week's Nuclear Security Summit is focused on how to prevent that risk. Dozens of world leaders working on ways to secure nuclear materials. Several ideas have come out of this summit. We reported yesterday that Ukraine plans to get rid of its enriched uranium, which can be used to make nuclear materials. The U.S. and Russia agreed to update a treaty aimed at eliminating weapons-grade plutonium from their military programs. You can see Secretary of State Clinton and her Russian counterpart signing off on the agreement. Plus, Mexico and Canada have announced plans to downgrade supplies of enriched uranium so that they can't be used to make nuclear weapons. Tuesday's session began on a sad note: a moment of silence for the victims of a plane crash that killed the president of Poland, along with that country's first lady and many top Polish officials. President Obama has said that he'll travel to Poland for the president and first lady's funeral. I.D. Me . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1964. I graduated from Princeton University and got my law degree from Harvard. I have two daughters: Malia and Sasha. I'm first lady Michelle Obama, the country's first African-American first lady. Michelle Obama . AZUZ: Right now, Michelle Obama is on her first official, solo trip as first lady. She arrived in Mexico yesterday for a three-day visit there. It's being made ""in recognition of the deep ties between the United States and Mexico."" While she is there, Mrs. Obama will meet with the first lady of Mexico, tour different cultural museums, and give a speech at a local university. But before that, she was in Haiti. It was a surprise stop Tuesday on her way to Mexico. She toured some of the areas that were devastated by the massive earthquake that hit the country in January. Afterward, the first lady promised that the U.S. is committed to helping Haiti recover from the disaster. Offer of Resignation . AZUZ: In Asia, Kurmanbek Bakiev, the president of Kyrgyzstan, says that he is willing to resign, but only if he and his relatives are allowed to leave the country safely. Kyrgyzstan has been going through some political turmoil recently. And when protesters took over the main government building, Bakiev left the capital city and a temporary government took over. Some officials in that new government would be just fine with Bakiev leaving Kyrgyzstan. Others think the president should have to stay and be held accountable for what they say are criminal actions. Charges have been filed against some of his relatives and associates. But Bakiev says he doesn't recognize any decisions made by the interim government. Rare Safety Warning . AZUZ: ""Don't buy: Safety risk."" It's a warning that Consumer Reports doesn't make too often. But it is making that warning about a sport utility vehicle made by Lexus. The Lexus GX460, you see right here, during a severe turn, it slides almost completely sideways. Consumer Reports says that's because a system that should stop the slide doesn't kick in in time, and that could cause a rollover. That's why the magazine issued the rare ""Don't buy"" warning. The last one of those was given out, in 2001. Toyota, which owns Lexus, said it'll conduct its own tests to see what steps need to be taken. This Day in History .

MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! The word ""olfactory"" refers to what sense? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Touch, B) Smell, C) Taste or D) Sight? You've got three seconds -- GO! You might have sniffed out that olfactory refers to your sense of smell. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Sniffing for Explosives . AZUZ: It comes in handy with flowers or food. But experts say our sense of smell can also work like a warning system. Kind of an olfactory alarm. That's also why dogs are sometimes used to sniff out danger. Their sense of smell can be a thousand times more sensitive than ours. And as Jeanne Meserve explains, what their nose knows could help save lives. (BEGIN VIDEO) JEANNE MESERVE, CNN HOMELAND SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: A dog's nose samples the air many times a second. This dog sniffs it for explosives. Zeta is what's called a ""vapor wake"" dog, trained to pick up the scent of explosives in the air despite crowds, cross currents and other smells in Washington, D.C.'s Union Station. Her nose can ferret out TATP, TNT and other explosives in a huge space, even though a person carrying them may have passed by as much as 15 minutes earlier. The head of Amtrak's K-9 program compares these animals to a top athlete. CAPTAIN WILLIAM PARKER, AMTRAK POLICE K-9 PROGRAM: Michael Jordan, and the reason why I say that is because Michael Jordan is one of the best basketball players of all time, and these vapor wake dogs, I put in that same category. MESERVE: Only 1 or 2 percent of puppies from Auburn University's breeding program have what it takes to be a vapor wake dog. JEANNE BROCK, MANAGER, AUBURN UNIVERSITY PUPPY PROGRAM: They'll hunt and hunt and hunt and won't come back without it. MESERVE: They are introduced at an early age to slippery surfaces and a variety of environments before being sent to prisons in Georgia, Florida and Mississippi, where inmates begin training the dogs to use their noses. Back at the Auburn facility, older dogs are conditioned on a souped-up golf cart to handle the rigors of their future jobs. They recognize about a dozen explosives and could be trained to find additional ones in just a day or two. I take a backpack containing explosives into a building to test a dog. I walk, sit and walk some more. So now, I'm going to hide this backpack full of smokeless powder right here. A minute later, Ranger, still in the early stages of training, tracks the explosive scent right to the source. DR. ROB GILLETTE, AUBURN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE: There are certain chefs who'll smell a pot of stew and say, ""Oh, that's oregano, or that's this type of spice."" The dog walks into it, smells this whole thing and says, ""Oh, that's C-4."" MESERVE: The U.S. Capitol Police are just starting to use vapor wake dogs. They've already augmented security at sporting events and other large gatherings. But Amtrak has embraced them despite the $20,000 price tag per dog. The rail carrier believes that in a high-risk, ever-changing transit environment, the dogs have advantages over machines, even though they can only work for about 90 minutes at a stretch. JOHN PEARCE, AUBURN UNIVERSITY CANINE DETECTION INSTITUTE: There's nothing like a dog as far as mobility, as far as how quickly it can detect explosives and take us to the source of it. And the cost is basically less than any type of technology out there. (END VIDEO) Blog Report . AZUZ: Kelly is a student who's talking to us on our blog about college.

"(CNN)  -- A car bomb exploded outside a British army base in Northern Ireland early Monday, injuring one person. The blast went off about 12:30 a.m. (7:30 p.m. Sunday ET) outside the Palace Barracks in the Belfast neighborhood of Holywood where Britain's MI5 intelligence service has its regional headquarters. The incident occurred just 30 minutes after police powers were transferred from London to Belfast. According to a statement from the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the bomb was placed in a stolen taxi which had been hijacked late Sunday in North Belfast. The taxi driver was held by three males for almost two hours before being told to drive his silver Skoda to the base. Police added that security staff at the facility were made aware of the abandoned vehicle just before midnight and commenced evacuation procedures. One elderly male, who was walking past the barracks at the time of the explosion, sustained minor injuries after the bomb detonated. There was no immediate report of a claim of responsibility for the blast, though the BBC reported that the Real IRA, a republican splinter group, admitted being behind the attack. ""Clearly the people responsible for this showed absolutely no regard for human life,"" said local police commander, Chief Superintendent Nigel Grimshaw. ""There is no question in my mind, this was designed for one thing and one thing only -- to kill or cause serious injury to people and that's exactly what it would have done were it not for the actions of my officers and military colleagues in the Barracks and the community themselves working together. ""Thankfully we were able to evacuate people from the immediate area of the explosion. ""The people responsible for this cowardly attack refuse to accept that Northern Ireland is moving on and that peace is working here.

Recent attacks in Northern Ireland have been blamed on dissident Irish republicans who reject the 1998 Good Friday accords, which sharply reduced violence in the British-ruled province. Northern Ireland was wracked for decades by violence between pro-British unionists and republicans who wanted Northern Ireland to join the rest of Ireland. About 3,000 people died in the ""Troubles,"" as the violence was known, before the tenuous peace agreement was hammered out. There has been sporadic violence since then. A booby-trapped car exploded on January 8, severely injuring Constable Peadar Heffron.

"London, England (CNN) -- The death of a British soldier on an explosives-clearing operation in Afghanistan has pushed the British death toll there past that of the 1982 Falklands War, the Ministry of Defence announced Tuesday. The soldier's death brings to 256 the number of British troops killed in Afghanistan since operations there began in 2001, the defense ministry said. The British death toll from the Falklands conflict was 255. The soldier, from the 36 Engineer Regiment, died Monday from an explosion in the Nad-e-Ali district of Afghanistan's southern Helmand Province. He was part of a task force to clear roadside bombs. ""He was leading a team conducting route-clearance operations at the time, making the way ahead safe for others to follow,"" said Lieutenant Colonel David Wakefield, a spokesman for Task Force Helmand. ""His indomitable courage and fortitude, the hallmark of his profession, will not be forgotten."" The Ministry of Defence did not release his name, but said his next of kin had been informed. Two soldiers from The Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, were killed by an explosion Monday, also in Helmand Province, the defense ministry said. The deaths of those soldiers, whose names were not released, meant the total death toll matched that of the Falklands. ""Sad milestones such as this naturally attract attention in the UK, but in theater our people continue resolutely and courageously with the task of assisting Afghans to build their own future,"" said Air Chief Marshal Jock Stirrup, chief of the British Defense Staff. ""We should not forget that each and every death of a member of our armed forces is a tragedy of equal proportion,"" British Defense Secretary Bob Ainsworth said. ""Our thoughts at this time lie firmly with the families and friends of all the brave men and women fallen in Afghanistan, and we should all remember that every one of them has given their lives in defense of their -- and our -- country."" The Falkland Islands are a British territory located 670 miles (1,000 kilometers) from the coast of Argentina. Argentina has claimed sovereignty over the islands since they were occupied by the British in 1833. Argentine troops invaded the islands in April 1982, sparking a two-month war with intense land and sea battles. Argentina surrendered June 14, having lost nearly 650 troops.","Latest casualty brings to 256 number of UK troops killed in Afghanistan .

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- German investigators raided the Frankfurt offices of KFW bank Wednesday in an investigation into a payment of more than $400 million made in error to failed U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers. Investigators from Germany's Federal Criminal Office and the state prosecutor's office conducted the raid and searches at Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (Credit Agency for Reconstruction), or KFW, spokesman Wolfram Schweickhardt said. The government-owned KFW bank group transferred €319 million ($412 million) to Lehman Brothers on September 15, after the U.S. bank filed for bankruptcy, the state prosecutor's office in Frankfurt said in a statement. Authorities are investigating KFW board members and bosses on suspicion of embezzlement, the prosecutor's office said. They want to know whether KFW officials were criminally negligent by failing to prevent the money transfer despite knowing about Lehman's liquidity problems and the impending international banking crisis. ""We are fully cooperating with the authorities and will provide them any documents they wish to see,"" Schweickhardt said. Schweickhardt said the money was transferred to Lehman on the morning of Monday, September 15, as part of a long-standing two-part transaction that had been in motion since July. The transaction was among about 1,000 automated transactions set up for that morning -- a normal volume for the agency, he said. Although ""people had discussed over the weekend the fact that Lehman Brothers was in trouble, no one thought to check the actual transfers in the system,"" Schweickhardt said. The mistake was spotted only a couple of hours later and the agency's chief executive was informed, he said. The following Thursday, the company suspended three directors; they were fired on September 29, he said. The firing of the three directors was widely reported in Germany, with the tabloid Bild showing a picture of them with the headline, ""Germany's dumbest bankers."" News headlines have since referred to KFW as ""Germany's dumbest bank.""

"(CNN) -- Texas child welfare officials have asked a judge to order a teenage member of a polygamous sect to let them take DNA from her infant so they can determine the father's identity, according to court documents filed in the case. An aerial view taken last year shows some living quarters at polygamist leader Warren Jeffs' Texas ranch. The teenager, who is younger than 18, is a member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She is believed to have had the baby in June, Texas Department of Family and Protective Services attorneys said in the documents, filed earlier this month. Child welfare authorities also believe the teenager was married at 14 to an adult male, department attorney John Dolezal writes in the motion. ""In order to determine the identity of the sexual perpetrator who engaged in sexual intercourse with [the girl] while she was a minor, which act consequently led to this pregnancy, the department is required to perform genetic testing on the child so as to determine who that individual is,"" the motion said. CNN is not naming the teenager, as authorities allege she is a victim of sexual abuse. A hearing on the matter was conducted Tuesday. Patrick Crimmins, spokesman for DFPS, said the teenager showed up without the baby. An agreement was reached by both sides during the hearing, Crimmins said, but the judge ordered that the agreement not be made public. The department has attempted to resolve the issue with the teenager but had not been successful, the motion said. The FLDS was thrust into the spotlight in April, when child welfare workers removed more than 400 children from the sect's Yearning for Zion Ranch in Eldorado, Texas, citing allegations of physical and sexual abuse. Following a court battle, the Texas Supreme Court ordered the children returned, saying there was no evidence they faced imminent danger of abuse on the ranch. Critics of the FLDS say the sect forces girls into marriage with men. To date, 12 FLDS members have been indicted on charges including sexual assault of a minor, conducting unlawful marriages involving a minor and bigamy as part of an ongoing investigation, according to Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott's office. They include Warren Jeffs, the FLDS leader and ""prophet."" Jeffs was already facing charges of sexual assault of a child in Texas, which carries a sentence of up to life upon conviction, when he was indicted earlier this month on a first-degree felony count of aggravated sexual assault. He is also facing a sentence of up to life in Utah, where he was convicted on accomplice to rape charges for his role in the marriage of a sect member to a 14-year-old. He is awaiting trial in Arizona, where he faces similar charges. The FLDS is a 10,000-member offshoot of the mainstream Mormon church. It openly practices polygamy on the ranch, as well as in two towns straddling the Utah-Arizona border.","Texas child welfare officials trying to determine father's identity .

"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- A 13-year-old who witnessed another teen being set on fire last month apologized Tuesday, saying he is praying for the boy's recovery and he is sorry for what happened. Reading to reporters from a statement, Jeremy Jarvis -- whose older brother has been charged in the incident -- said that victim Michael Brewer is in his prayers. ""I want to read something I wrote last night,"" Jarvis said. ""I want to express my deepest sympathy to Mikey and his family. I will pray for Mikey to grow stronger every day and for Mikey's speedy recovery."" Brewer, 15, remains in guarded condition at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center. He suffered third-degree burns over 65 percent of his body in the Deerfield Beach, Florida, incident October 12, authorities have said. Police have been able to interview Brewer for the first time since the incident, the Broward County Sheriff's Office said. Hospital officials have said Brewer can communicate only in one- or two-word answers. ""The more information we have, the better position we are in to make the right decision"" as far as charges and how to proceed, said Maria Schneider, a prosecutor with the state attorney's office in Broward County. ""I would say he [Brewer] needs a little more time to be fully prepared to provide a detailed account of the incident."" ""It was difficult. It was difficult for him to talk about. Difficult for us to listen to,"" she said of the interview. ""Just difficult all around, heart-wrenching. He's doing so much better, but it's such a terrible situation."" Jeremy Jarvis was arrested as a juvenile after Brewer was burned and spent about 30 days in juvenile detention. However, prosecutors have not filed charges against him. He still could be charged, as prosecutors have 90 days from his arrest to decide whether to move forward with the case. He has not been interviewed by police or prosecutors, Schneider said. ""He has invoked his rights to counsel and has invoked his rights to silence."" His brother, Denver, 15, is among three teenagers charged as adults with one count of attempted second-degree murder in the attack. He has pleaded not guilty. ""I want to tell my brother D.C. I love and miss him,"" Jeremy Jarvis told reporters Tuesday. ""I just hope and pray we all get through this."" The boy's attorney, Stephen Melnick, would not allow reporters to ask him questions. The extent of Jeremy Jarvis' involvement remains under investigation, Melnick said, adding that police took a statement from Brewer on Monday. ""As far as we know, he [Jeremy Jarvis] just followed and watched what happened,"" he said. Denver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, also 15, are accused along with a third teen, Jesus Mendez, 16, of being in a group that poured alcohol over Brewer and set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle. All three pleaded not guilty in an appearance last week in Broward County Circuit Court. If convicted, they would face a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. Detectives say eyewitnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Denver Jarvis allegedly poured alcohol over him. Bent allegedly encouraged the attack, police said. Brewer jumped into a pool at his apartment complex to put out the flames. Authorities have said Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire. According to an arrest transcript, the boy said he made a ""bad decision."" Dr. Michael Brannon, a court-appointed forensic psychologist, interviewed both the Jarvis brothers. ""I can describe both of them as being afraid, being fearful,"" he told CNN earlier this month. ""I can describe both of them as being tearful at various times during the interview, especially when talking about the specific incident which led to the injuries of the victim."" The Jarvis family met at Melnick's office Tuesday, shortly before the boy read the short written statement to reporters. He took no questions. During the meeting, Jeremy Jarvis played with Melnick's dog. Although the state can still file charges against him, ""it didn't matter to him,"" Melnick said. ""It was important to say how this really bothers him and how much he loves his brother and how much he hopes Michael gets better."" He said Brewer is a close friend of Jeremy Jarvis, and the boy is troubled by Brewer's injury as well as by his brother facing criminal charges that could land him in an adult prison if convicted. Doctors had planned to perform skin graft surgery on Brewer last Friday, but decided to wait and let him heal a bit more first, hospital officials said. His doctor has said he faces several more months in the hospital and will need multiple skin grafts and surgeries. Melnick would not say whether Jeremy Jarvis is cooperating with prosecutors, but said he didn't believe the boy's apology would affect whether charges are filed. ""It's something he's been wanting to say from the start,"" he said. ""He's been asking every day if he could say something."" Broward County schools expelled the seventh-grader after his arrest, Melnick said. He is being home-schooled, and his family is exploring alternative education arrangements. Jeremy Jarvis turned 13 about a month ago, but ""he understands what's happening,"" Melnick said. ""He spent 30 days in a jail.""","Jeremy Jarvis, 13, who saw teen set on fire, apologizes, says he's praying for recovery .

"New York (CNN)  -- Rapper Lil Wayne will go directly to jail after he is sentenced by a Manhattan judge Tuesday afternoon for a gun conviction, according to a person familiar with the case. Dwayne Carter, as he is known legally, pleaded guilty to felony gun charges in a deal with prosecutors October 2009. He is expected to get a one-year prison sentence. His sentencing was delayed three weeks so he could get some dental work done, including removal of his diamond-studded braces. The person familiar with the case would not confirm where Wayne would serve his sentence. The plea agreement was a result of the rapper's 2007 arrest outside New York's Beacon Theater. According to police, Wayne had a .40-caliber pistol on his tour bus. ""It's not his gun, they know whose gun it is,"" Wayne's attorney, Stacey Richman, said after a hearing last month. In an unrelated case, Wayne also faces felony drug possession and weapons charges in the state of Arizona. Lil Wayne is a multiplatinum-selling and Grammy-winning rap artist. His hits include ""The Block is Hot"" and ""Lollipop,"" and his album ""Tha Carter III"" was the top-selling disc of 2008. His latest album, ""Rebirth,"" was released last month.

"(CNN) -- Michelle Timberlake didn't expect to venture into the weekend blizzard that blanketed much of the mid-Atlantic. But the interior designer who normally wears high heels to work found herself running through hip-high snow Saturday morning when about 40 cows escaped from the pasture on her and her husband's Boyce, Virginia, farm in search of food and shelter. ""This was not what I imagined for myself,"" she said Sunday, laughing at the memory. Luckily, the cows were corralled -- thanks to a bale of hay -- and the snow stopped, but not before more than 30 inches had been dumped over two days in parts of the region. Timberlake said she and her neighbors were gearing up for the next weather system, expected to hit the area as early as Tuesday. The National Weather Service is forecasting more than 5 inches of snow and winds up to 25 mph in the Washington and Baltimore, Maryland, areas. ""Everybody's just trying to clean up and get a little bit ahead of the game before the next round comes,"" said Timberlake, whose farm is located about two hours west of Washington. More than 300,000 people from Pennsylvania to Virginia were without electricity Sunday, utility companies said. In many cases, heavy snow brought down power lines. ""I'm not sure how many people will have their power back on by Super Bowl time, but things are going really well today,"" said Joe Gilbert with a Dominion Power crew working Sunday afternoon to restore power to about 3,000 in one McLean, Virginia, neighborhood. ""It's good weather and we're making good progress so hopefully everybody's power will be back on."" Timberlake said homes around the corner from her farm are without power and have been told it won't be back on until Friday. ""Since the heavy, wet snow is still bringing trees down, we are still seeing new outages occur,"" Allegheny Power said in a statement Sunday. ""Damage assessment is ongoing, but overall estimated times for the restoration of service have not been determined."" The utility company provides electricity to customers in Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia and Virginia. Nearly 135,000 of its customers had no power, the majority of them, or 92,295, reside in Pennsylvania, the company said. Outages were also reported in Delaware and New Jersey. Residents, businesses and airports were trying to dig out Sunday. Good Samaritans in McLean, Virginia, stopped to help drivers stuck in snow drifts. ""So much for going to the Kennedy Center today,"" said one woman behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz as about five men shoveled and pushed her car out of deep snow. ""We're going home."" CNN iReporter Sean Conrad described his town of Rockville, Maryland, Saturday as empty and photos showed streets recognizable only by traffic lights. The city got 25.5 inches. Conrad told CNN that many roads still were covered by snow Sunday, even though snow plows were working 24 hours a day to clear them. Only a few businesses opened Sunday, and those that did operated with skeleton crews, Conrad said. Federal offices in Washington will be closed Monday, though emergency employees still are expected to work, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management said Sunday. Air traffic in Washington picked up slowly Sunday after a day of cancellations. A record 32.4 inches of snow fell on Dulles International Airport over two days, breaking a January 7-8, 1996, record of 23.2 inches. The quick-falling flakes forced Dulles and the other two main Washington-Baltimore area airports to cancel all flights Saturday. Dulles reopened Sunday to limited service, according to Rob Yingling, spokesman for Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. Airport personnel were still removing snow from the Baltimore-Washington International Airport on Sunday, and it remained uncertain when flights would resume, spokesman Jonathan Dean told CNN. Reagan National Airport was still closed early Sunday afternoon as crews continued to plow snow and chip away at 5 inches of ice that developed overnight, Washington Metropolitan Airports Authority spokeswoman Tara Hamilton said. The airport accommodates just under 700 flights a day, she said. Philadelphia International Airport in Pennsylvania racked up 28.5 inches of snow, the National Weather Service. The airport was closed Saturday, but it reopened Sunday and was expected to operate at 60 percent capacity, spokeswoman Victoria Lupica said. Amtrak canceled several trains Sunday after trees and power lines fell onto portions of its tracks, the transit company said. Dozens of Greyhound routes in the Mid-Atlantic states also were canceled, the bus company said on its Web site. And state officials have advised drivers to stay off the roads. CNN's Sarah Aarthun, Justin Lear, Sarah Lee and Rachel Rodriguez contributed to this report.","NEW: Federal offices in Washington will be closed Monday .

We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Based on the sheer volume of bodies, Hajj should not work. As the world's largest pilgrimage and one of the Five Pillars of Islam, each year about 3 million people cram themselves into the relatively small holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, to offer up this, the holiest of Islamic rites. In late 2008, I accompanied my parents on Hajj and managed to sneak a VBS video camera past state security and capture the trip as we saw it. The scene was insane, beyond what I could have ever imagined. Over a four-day period, Mecca's population is more than doubled, with legions of devout Muslims making their way shoulder to shoulder through the dozen rituals that comprise Hajj. If it weren't for the solemn and religious underpinnings, it would be an unnerving assembly of human beings for such a concentrated space -- like what Woodstock might have been, but less annoying and without the hippies, drugs, and Carlos Santana. Many Hajj rites have been dramatized in movies and elsewhere, but it is essentially a highly choreographed succession of religious tasks: circling the Ka'bah at the center of Masjid Al-Haram (the Grand Mosque), Sa`I (pacing between two holy sites), the famous Stoning of the Devil, loads of deep prayer and meditation. The point is to purge believers of sins and free them for the next chapter in their lives. It is required that each Muslim of means make the trip at least once. See part two of Mecca Diaries at VBS.TV . Given the number of pilgrims and the extremely short span of time Hajj covers, it is virtually impossible to make the journey without the help of a tour group. There are dozens of agencies available to help usher visitors through the masses and ensure that all the requisite rituals are met. But even with their guidance, completing all the tasks, navigating the various holy sites, and sticking to the hurried itinerary is extremely challenging. Compound the situation with several million people of every economic class and comfort from 100-plus countries across the globe -- many lined up asleep on the side of the road, praying on hilltops, and making their way to and from holy sites -- and it's no surprise that some pilgrims can't complete all the rituals. But despite this monumental challenge, the bottom line was that doing the Hajj was amazing. It took us to another plane of existence, it forced a detachment from our lives, and it was unlike anything I've ever experienced.","Three million people take part in the world's largest annual pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia .

"Washington -- Good night, Loran. In a series of small ceremonies, the U.S. Coast Guard on Monday shut down Loran-C, a navigation and timing system that has guided mariners and aviators since World War II. The death blow came last May when President Obama called the system obsolete, saying it is no longer needed in an age in which Global Positioning System devices are nearly ubiquitous in cars, planes and boats. Killing Loran-C will save the government $190 million over five years, Obama said. But supporters of Loran -- including the man known as ""the father of GPS"" -- say the nation's increasing reliance on GPS paradoxically has increased the importance of maintaining Loran as a backup. Supporters also argue that the mere existence of Loran makes the GPS satellite system a less attractive target for cyber-thugs, terrorists or future military adversaries. GPS systems today are used not only for navigation, but also to provide precise timing for ATM machines, cell phone towers, water plants and other enterprises, and positioning information for precision-guided weapons for the military. GPS disruptions can be costly to business, dangerous for travelers, and debilitating to the military. Supporters of Loran -- short for long range navigation system -- say the system is a near-perfect backup because it provides similar information to GPS, but has dissimilar infrastructure. GPS is based on a constellation of at least 25 satellites; Loran is based on 24 ground stations in the United States, and others elsewhere. GPS transmits a very faint signal and is vulnerable to interference or jamming; Loran has a high-power signal which can penetrate obstacles like foliage and is harder to interrupt.  GPS is powered by solar panels; Loran is tied to ground power. And while GPS operates in outer space, outside of controlled perimeters, Loran operates inside controlled perimeters in the United States. The vulnerability of GPS and the consequences of an outage became evident in 2007 during a Navy training exercise in the Port of San Diego, California.  Participants unintentionally jammed GPS signals in the region, shutting down satellite navigation and cell phone service up to 10 miles inland for three hours. The satellite-based system's vulnerability became apparent a second time that year, when China tested an anti-satellite weapon, destroying one of its own aging weather satellites. Indeed, in recent years, as the popularity of GPS soared and the number of Loran users dwindled, the fate of the Loran system has followed a meandering path of near-death and rebirth experiences that even the most sophisticated navigation system would have difficulty tracking. During the Bush administration, the system was at one point placed on the chopping block, but was resurrected amid a flurry of reports from Loran backers. In late 2006, an Independent Assessment Team headed by Bradford Parkinson, known as the ""father of GPS,"" unanimously recommended that an enhanced version of Loran, known as eLORAN, ""be completed and retained as the national backup system for GPS,"" saying it had ""critical safety of life, national and economic security, and quality of life applications."" The assessment team recommended that the government complete the eLORAN upgrade and commit to eLORAN as the national backup to GPS for 20 years. But the Obama administration has described Loran as unnecessary and antiquated. In a May 7 speech, Obama used Loran as an example of government waste. ""This system once made a lot of sense, before there were satellites to help us navigate,"" Obama said. ""Now there's GPS. And yet, year after year, this obsolete technology has continued to be funded even though it serves no government function and very few people are left who still actually use it."" So at 3 p.m. Monday, the U.S. Coast Guard turned off Loran signals at 19 of the 24 Loran stations. Signals remain at five stations because of agreements with Russia and Canada, but the Coast Guard expects those stations to be decommissioned by June after the United States receives verification that those countries have been notified of the change. The five stations that temporarily remain on line are at Attu, in Alaska's Aleutian Islands, and Caribou, Maine; Nantucket, Massachusetts; Shoal Cove, Alaska; and George, Washington. Chief Warrant Officer 4 Dave Robbio said the Loran signals at the 19 closed stations will be on a ""hot stand-by"" for the next week, allowing the signals to be turned back on if something unforeseen occurs. If there are no problems, the transmitters will be completely powered down next Monday. Some congressional critics say it is a mistake to shut down the system. In a November letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, two top members of the Senate Homeland Security Committee urged that Loran-C be spared. Deploying an enhanced Loran, or eLORAN, would cost about $100 million, Sens. Joseph Lieberman, I-Connecticut, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, wrote -- about one half the amount of placing one new GPS satellite in orbit, they said. But the case for dismantling Loran also has its advocates, including the U.S. Coast Guard. In a submission to the Federal Register, the Coast Guard said Loran-C was not established as, nor was it it intended to be, a backup for GPS. Other radio navigation systems, or operational procedures, can be used as backups for GPS navigation and other critical applications, the Coast Guard said. The Department of Homeland Security says it is currently reviewing the nation's critical infrastructure ""to determine if a single, domestic system is needed as a GPS backup."" ""The continued active operation of Loran-C is not necessary to advance this evaluation,"" DHS said. But hope springs eternal for some Loran supporters, who hope the Coast Guard will mothball the system rather than destroy it. Mothballing the stations would allow the government to resurrect the system if ongoing studies show Loran is the appropriate backup for GPS. But one Loran supporter acknowledged that hopes of reviving the system, at this point, may just be ""wishful thinking.""","U.S. shut down 19 of 24 land-based Loran-C navigation stations on Monday .

"Editor's note: Junot Díaz's novel ""The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao"" won the Pulitzer Prize in 2008. (OPRAH.com) -- It wasn't that I couldn't write. I wrote every day. I actually worked really hard at writing. At my desk by 7 a.m., would work a full eight and more. Scribbled at the dinner table, in bed, on the toilet, on the No. 6 train, at Shea Stadium. I did everything I could. But none of it worked. My novel, which I had started with such hope shortly after publishing my first book of stories, wouldn't budge past the 75-page mark. Nothing I wrote past page 75 made any kind of sense. Nothing. Which would have been fine if the first 75 pages hadn't been pretty damn cool. But they were cool, showed a lot of promise. Would also have been fine if I could have just jumped to something else. But I couldn't. All the other novels I tried sucked worse than the stalled one, and even more disturbing, I seemed to have lost the ability to write short stories. It was like I had somehow slipped into a No-Writing Twilight Zone and I couldn't find an exit. Like I'd been chained to the sinking ship of those 75 pages and there was no key and no patching the hole in the hull. I wrote and I wrote and I wrote, but nothing I produced was worth a damn. Want to talk about stubborn? I kept at it for five straight years. Five damn years. Every day failing for five years? I'm a pretty stubborn, pretty hard-hearted character, but those five years of fail did a number on my psyche. On me. Five years, 60 months? It just about wiped me out. By the end of that fifth year, perhaps in an attempt to save myself, to escape my despair, I started becoming convinced that I had written all I had to write, that I was a minor league Ralph Ellison, a Pop Warner Edward Rivera, that maybe it was time, for the sake of my mental health, for me to move on to another profession, and if the inspiration struck again some time in the future...well, great. But I knew I couldn't go on much more the way I was going. I just couldn't. I was living with my fiancée at the time (over now, another terrible story) and was so depressed and self-loathing I could barely function. I finally broached the topic with her of, maybe, you know, doing something else. My fiancée was so desperate to see me happy (and perhaps more than a little convinced by my fear that maybe the thread had run out on my talent) that she told me to make a list of what else I could do besides writing. I'm not a list person like she was, but I wrote one. It took a month to pencil down three things. (I really don't have many other skills.) I stared at that list for about another month. Waiting, hoping, praying for the book, for my writing, for my talent to catch fire. A last-second reprieve. But nada. So I put the manuscript away. All the hundreds of failed pages, boxed and hidden in a closet. I think I cried as I did it. Five years of my life and the dream that I had of myself, all down the tubes because I couldn't pull off something other people seemed to pull off with relative ease: a novel. By then I wasn't even interested in a Great American Novel. I would have been elated with the eminently forgettable New Jersey novel. Oprah.com: The real meaning of your ""true calling"" So I became a normal. A square. I didn't go to bookstores or read the Sunday book section of the Times. I stopped hanging out with my writer friends. The bouts of rage and despair, the fights with my fiancée ended. I slipped into my new morose half-life. Started preparing for my next stage, back to school in September. (I won't even tell you what I was thinking of doing, too embarrassing.) While I waited for September to come around, I spent long hours in my writing room, sprawled on the floor, with the list on my chest, waiting for the promise of those words to leak through the paper into me. Maybe I would have gone through with it. Hard to know. But if the world is what it is so are our hearts. One night in August, unable to sleep, sickened that I was giving up, but even more frightened by the thought of having to return to the writing, I dug out the manuscript. I figured if I could find one good thing in the pages I would go back to it. Just one good thing. Like flipping a coin, I'd let the pages decide. Spent the whole night reading everything I had written, and guess what? It was still terrible. In fact with the new distance the lameness was even worse than I'd thought. That's when I should have put everything in the box. When I should have turned my back and trudged into my new life. I didn't have the heart to go on. But I guess I did. While my fiancée slept, I separated the 75 pages that were worthy from the mountain of loss, sat at my desk, and despite every part of me shrieking no no no no, I jumped back down the rabbit hole again. There were no sudden miracles. It took two more years of heartbreak, of being utterly, dismayingly lost before the novel I had dreamed about for all those years finally started revealing itself. And another three years after that before I could look up from my desk and say the word I'd wanted to say for more than a decade: done. Oprah.com: 4 writers answer ""What makes you you?"" That's my tale in a nutshell. Not the tale of how I came to write my novel but rather of how I became a writer. Because, in truth, I didn't become a writer the first time I put pen to paper or when I finished my first book (easy) or my second one (hard). You see, in my view a writer is a writer not because she writes well and easily, because she has amazing talent, because everything she does is golden. In my view a writer is a writer because even when there is no hope, even when nothing you do shows any sign of promise, you keep writing anyway. Wasn't until that night when I was faced with all those lousy pages that I realized, really realized, what it was exactly that I am. Oprah.com: 11 ways to find your calling .

"New York (CNN) -- Newt Gingrich called President Obama ""the most radical president in American history"" at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference last week. The leader of the 1994 Republican Revolution is a smart man and a historian, so he must know better. But he's also exploring a run for president, an action that frequently suspends good judgment in pursuit of sound bites. Perspective is the first thing abandoned in hyper-partisan attacks. So here is a look at five presidents who, it could be argued, exceed Obama in the ""radical"" sweepstakes. • Franklin D. Roosevelt: How about this for radical: a president who overturned the two-term precedent set by George Washington and ultimately won four terms in an era when dictators were in vogue worldwide. He also proposed expanding the Supreme Court to pack it with his own appointees, attempting to fundamentally alter the separation of powers. And his New Deal created the basis for the modern welfare state in the U.S., whose apex under self-styled inheritor Lyndon Johnson provoked a backlash that ushered in a generation of conservative resurgence. • John Adams: The nation's second president has been getting a well-deserved reappraisal, thanks to David McCullough's magisterial biography. But Adams' signing of the Alien and Sedition acts during the threat of war -- effectively outlawing anti-government dissent and curtailing freedom of speech and freedom of the press -- was a radically anti-democratic action and a black mark on this Founding Father's otherwise honorable service to our nation. • Andrew Jackson: The man on the $20 bill was the original populist president, a general who fought Washington elites, British soldiers and native American tribes alike. Old Hickory's wars with the Second National Bank, Congress and the Supreme Court were legendary. His native American removal policies rescinded previously agreed-upon treaties and brought about the infamous ""Trail of Tears"" that led to the deaths of thousands. • Abraham Lincoln: Abolitionists accused Lincoln of being insufficiently radical because he pledged only to preserve the union at all costs. But his political opponents accused him of being radical because he wanted to stop the spread of slavery, and they spurred secession from the union soon after hearing of his election. It's a reminder that exaggerated fear of change can lead to the rise of violent factions. During the Civil War, Lincoln suspended habeas corpus. He has become controversial again to some activists; one panel at the Conservative Political Action Conference asked, ""Lincoln on Liberty: Friend or Foe?"" • George W. Bush: The Bush Doctrine reversed decades of American foreign policy by allowing pre-emptive invasions of foreign nations. In Iraq's case, this was complicated by the fact that the dictator in question did not, in fact, have the weapons of mass destruction as advertised. Add to that Bush's reluctance to actually pay for his wars directly, which resulted in his turning a hard-won surplus into a deficit, and you've got what can be considered a radical affront to small-government conservative principles from a Republican president. Each of these presidents has his passionate defenders, and many are routinely listed among America's greatest chief executives. Of course, plenty of other presidents could be added to this list: from Woodrow Wilson, who institutionalized segregation in the federal government, to Richard Nixon, whose ""Saturday Night Massacre"" firing of his attorney general, Justice Department first deputy and independent special prosecutor created a constitutional crisis in the wake of Watergate. But you get the idea. None of the presidents are really radical in any global sense. Any all-good or all-bad analysis of American history always misses the big picture. And politics is history in the present tense. Yes, the past 16 months have seen unprecedented levels of government spending, intended to alleviate the economic crisis that was occurring when Obama took office. And although skyrocketing debts and deficits are dangerous if not addressed decisively in the near-term, Obama's general approach to the office has been decidedly more center-left than radical left. Think Afghanistan, for example, where he has committed more troops to the war. Or his economic team, led by Clinton administration alumni and Wall Street veterans. Though many conservatives have called him a socialist, some liberals (and libertarian Republican Ron Paul) consider him a ""corporatist."" You can't be both a socialist and a corporatist at the same time. The larger issue is politics, plain and simple. Gingrich is trying to run for president. And red meat lines like ""the most radical president in American history"" help keep him relevant in GOP circles. The real issue is less what Obama has done as president than who he is. Gingrich and most baby boomer conservatives have spent their professional lives running against the liberal excesses of the 1960s. It is engrained in their political DNA. And Obama looks like a child of the Great Society, an embodiment of the social changes of the 1960s. The more centrist his rhetoric, the more some conservatives are convinced that it's all part of activist Saul Alinsky's playbook: to sound reasonable but act radical. The problem is that this suspicion of Obama's motives dooms any concept of common ground and poisons the well for bipartisan progress. You can't negotiate reasonably with a president when you've convinced supporters that he is a threat to our constitutional republic. More broadly, we've grown almost accustomed to these overheated attacks on the presidency. Obama Derangement Syndrome on the right -- of which Gingrich's claim was a mild example -- was preceded by Bush Derangement Syndrome on the left, with protestors comparing W. to a Nazi and a terrorist. As a country, we have become accustomed to using fear and hate in the service of hyper-partisanship. We need to wake up to the fact that demonizing people we disagree with, and indulging in attempts to delegitimize a duly elected president from Day One, hurts us all as a nation. We can do better -- and we deserve better, especially from people who want to lead the nation themselves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John P. Avlon.","Newt Gingrich called Barack Obama ""most radical president in American history""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama on Thursday strongly criticized controversial anti-homosexuality legislation being considered by Uganda's legislature. It is ""unconscionable to target gays or lesbians for who they are,"" Obama said during an appearance at the National Prayer Breakfast. The measure being considered in Uganda is ""odious,"" he added. The organization which sponsors the breakfast, the Fellowship Foundation, has been associated with efforts to pass the bill, according to the ethics group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The measure would punish sexual activity between persons of the same sex with long jail terms or death. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also criticized the bill during an appearance at the breakfast. CREW had protested Obama's appearance at the breakfast, claiming in a statement that the event ""designed to appear as if government-sanctioned, actually serves as a meeting and recruiting event for the shadowy Fellowship Foundation,"" also known as ""The Foundation"" and ""The Family."" A Ugandan legislator who introduced the bill -- which has been roundly condemned by human rights groups -- was scheduled to attend the breakfast before his invitation was revoked, CREW claimed. The breakfast is held annually on the first Thursday in February. The president, members of Congress and other dignitaries regularly attend. Members of the Fellowship Foundation could not be reached for comment early Thursday. CREW did not divulge the source of its information. J. Robert Hunter, a member of The Fellowship who has spoken publicly about the group, told The New York Times in a story published Thursday that it was unfair to blame the group for the Uganda legislation. About 30 family members, all Americans who are active in Africa, conveyed their dismay about the legislation to Ugandan politicians, including the bill's sponsor, Hunter said. CREW asked Obama and members of Congress on Monday not to attend the breakfast. On Wednesday, it asked television network C-SPAN to refrain from broadcasting the prayer breakfast, or at least to properly identify its sponsor as the Fellowship. ""The Fellowship has been cultivating an unorthodox brand of Christianity amongst the political, military and economic elite of America and other countries for over 50 years, focused on meeting Jesus 'man-to-man,'"" CREW said. ""The organization operates under an intense veil of secrecy, staying largely out of the public eye and hiding its donors' identities."" Its leader, Doug Coe, has led the group since 1969, according to CREW. The fellowship operates a residence and meeting place on Capitol Hill that has been linked to ""ethically troubled"" politicians, including Sen. John Ensign and South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, the ethics group said. ""The president and members of Congress should not legitimize this cult-like group -- the head of which has praised the organizing abilities of Hitler and bin Laden -- by attending the breakfast,"" Melanie Sloan, CREW executive director, said in a statement.","NEW: Obama calls Uganda's proposed law ""odious"" in speech at prayer breakfast .

"East Rutherford, New Jersey (CNN) -- From nuclear weapons to human rights, the image of Iran is quite negative in America. But with little fanfare, one Iranian man has won hearts and cheers battling Americans on the court in basketball arenas around the country. Hamed Haddadi is the NBA's first Iranian basketball player. At 7-foot-2, Haddadi began playing for Tennessee's Memphis Grizzlies in August 2008. His final game of this season was set for Wednesday night in Oklahoma City. Despite U.S.-Iran tensions in the political arena, any strains appear absent with teammates and fans alike. ""It seems like he's the most popular Grizzly. When we go on the road ... he has a lot of support from a lot of people, a lot of people come out to watch him and watch us play,"" said teammate Mike Conley, who accompanied Haddadi to a ""kebab fest."" The kebab fest was held in Las Vegas in 2009. Haddadi was accompanied by Conley and fellow Grizzly Hakim Warrick to a Persian restaurant. The event served to introduce the teammates to Persian food. Grizzlies' forward Rudy Gay turned the tables when he took Haddadi for a taste of American ribs at a Memphis restaurant. It wasn't as easy getting permission to play in the United States. Current U.S. sanctions on Iran prohibit ""a person or organization in the United States from engaging in business dealings with Iranian nationals,"" stated the NBA legal counsel. The NBA had to apply to the U.S. government for a license that granted Haddadi permission to play for the NBA. The reception has been positive courtside. But problems arose from game announcers once. Ralph Lawler and Mike Smith, L.A. Clippers announcers on local Fox Sports, were suspended for a game for insensitive comments about Haddadi. When the Grizzlies faced the Clippers, the two joked about the Iranian center. ""You're sure it's not Borat's older brother?"" said Smith. ""If they ever make a movie about Haddadi, I'm going to get Sacha Baron Cohen to play the part."" Mayar Zokaei, Haddadi's Iranian-American manager, said the Iranian basketball player has brought lots of media attention to the middle-of-the-standings Grizzlies. ""He's gotten more press then any of his teammates this year and the past couple of years just for the sole reason that he's Iranian-American,"" said Zokaei. ""Iranian playing basketball in America ... that's rare. [There aren't many]) Iranians doing anything in bona fide sports arenas in the U.S."" Haddadi faces big challenges. One is speaking and learning English. Furthermore, his family is almost 7,000 miles away in Iran. The political turmoil back home is something he can't control. He worries about his family. ""It affects him because he misses them, he's not able to keep up to date with them because he's so busy ... he's always concerned about their well-being and such,"" said Zokaei. Off the court, Haddadi has been working to bridge the gap between Iranian-Americans and basketball. Haddadi was at the forefront of creating the Hamed Haddadi Javanan Foundation. The charity organization aims to award college scholarships to student athletes. The foundation has not been his only initiative. In 2009, with Los Angeles Lakers forward Ron Artest and manager Zokaei, Haddadi hosted a weekend basketball camp for 100 children. The camp was held on the campus of California State University at Northridge and was aimed mainly at the Iranian-American community. Haddadi's team did not make the NBA playoffs, which start within the week. His next test on the court -- playing for Iran against the United States in the world championships in September in Turkey. Haddadi and teammate Rudy Gay agree the United States will win. ""Tell you the truth ... we can't beat the United States you know,"" said Haddadi. ""We're [The U.S.] gonna win, of course,"" boasted Gay. But his two years in America have been a personal victory for Haddadi, who just wants to play more when he returns to America.","Hamed Haddadi began playing for Tennessee's Memphis Grizzlies in August 2008 .

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Artyem Saveliev turns eight years old this week. His birthday will be anything but normal. Last Thursday his American adoptive family put him on a solo, trans-Atlantic flight from the United States to Moscow. They hired a Russian driver to deliver the boy from the airport to the Russian Ministry of Education. Russian officials allowed CNN to see a copy of a letter addressed to the Ministry of Education and signed by Artyem's adoptive mother, Torry Hansen, which the little boy carried when he arrived. ""To Whom It May Concern,"" the letter reads, ""This child is mentally unstable. He is violent and has severe psychopathic issues/behaviors. I was lied to and misled by the Russian Orphanage workers and director regarding his mental stability... After giving my best to this child, I am sorry to say that for the safety of my family, friends and myself, I no longer wish to parent this child. As he is a Russian National, I am returning him to your guardianship and would like the adoption disannulled [sic]."" Russian officials are fuming at these accusations. ""How can you imagine that a 7-year-old boy can be [a] menace or danger for the family? For the adult people?"" said Pavel Astakhov, Russia's Child Rights Ombudsmen. ""[Artyem] is in very good mental and physical condition,"" Astakhov said. ""He's a very nice boy. He's funny. And he's very communicative."" Astakhov met with Artyem several times since he arrived in Moscow, as have officials from the U.S. Embassy. ""When we saw him, he looked like a very tired little boy off a long trans-Atlantic flight,"" said John Beyrle, the U.S. ambassador in Moscow. The case of Artyem comes after the Russian media focused intense attention on several previous cases in recent years of abuse involving adopted Russian children in the United States. Not surprisingly, some Russians are calling for an end to the practice of foreign adoption. ""I am against the idea of sending our children abroad,"" said a woman, who gave her name only as Alexandra, as she watched her grandchildren play on a sunny day in a Moscow park. Russian officials have made public appeals for a temporary freeze of American adoption of Russian children until a proposed bilateral treaty has been signed to allow monitoring of children after they are brought to the United States. ""We don't have any instrument or tools to control our children which are living in adoptive families,"" said Astakhov. ""In this situation we have a kind of legal vacuum ... we have to freeze all activity in the adoptive process for the United States of America."" Those are ominous words for thousands of desperate American families who end up waiting years and spending tens of thousands of dollars trying to adopt Russian children. According to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, more then 50,000 Russian children have been adopted by American families in the last 16 years. The U.S. State Department offered to send a delegation of diplomats to Moscow later this month to address the adoption issue. ""The Russian government has now told us informally that that's acceptable. We're actually working out the dates,"" said Beyrle. ""So I would say to American families that are in the process of adoption not to worry too much. We're working on this, and we really don't think that this will have any long-term effect on the ability of American families to adopt here."" Russia has no shortage of orphans. The United Nations Children Fund reported that in 2008, some 714,000 Russian children were living in state institutions. Unlike many Western societies, the vast majority -- 83 percent of these children -- are ""social orphans"" taken from biological parents who were deemed unfit by Russian state agencies, said Bertram Beinvel, UNICEF's representative in Moscow. ""What is important to draw out of this [Artyem's] case is to conduct a thorough analysis on the adoption of the child, then to [learn] what happened when he was put back on the plane,"" Beinvel said. He also called for a bilateral treaty to prevent future cases of abuse from occurring. Both U.S. and Russian officials predicted it might take a matter of months to hammer out this proposed agreement. But that offers little consolation to Artyem Saveliev, who has now lost two families before reaching the age of 8. ""He lost his native family, his mother. And he lost his adoptive family, Torry Hansen,"" said Astakhov. ""Now the best way is to place him in a new family which can give him attention and love."" But Astakhov made it clear any new family for Artyem would be a Russian one.","Russian officials allowed CNN to see a copy of a letter sent to Russia with 7-year-old Artyem .

"(Mental Floss) -- Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to seek out covert items at fast food chains around the country. Not all food items are always listed on restaurant menus. Be warned, this mission includes very real dangers such as hardening arteries and skyrocketing cholesterol. We've compiled a list to get you started. 1. If you're at Starbucks and in need of just a little caffeine, don't worry -- there's a tiny option for you. It's the Short size, and they don't advertise it. It's like a little baby cup of coffee. It also comes in handy when you're scrounging for change and don't have enough for a tall (not that that has ever happened to me). 2. It's a good thing we don't have Jamba Juice here in Iowa, because I would be all over candy-based smoothies. Because it's considered a health-food chain, Jamba Juice doesn't officially list these on their in-store menus, but the Web site Mighty Foods assures us that the secret flavors exist. The ones they confirmed with the company's headquarters include Strawberry Shortcake, White Gummy Bear, PB&J, Various flavors of Starbursts, Fruity Pebbles, Push-Up Pops, and Skittles. Other tantalizing flavors that are rumored to exist: Chocolate Gummi Bear, Apple Pie, Sourpatch Kid, Tootsie Roll, and Now and Later. 3. This one might be my favorite. At Fatburger, you can order a Hypocrite -- a veggie burger topped with crispy strips of bacon. 4. Chipotle has a whole secret menu that is limited only by your imagination -- they have a store policy that says that if they have the item available, they will make it for you. Things that have been tested include nachos, quesadillas, taco salads and single tacos. Some stores are testing out quesadillas as a regular menu item, however, so maybe someday soon you won't need a super-secret handshake to order one. Mental Floss: 7 food promotions gone horribly wrong . 5. If you're at Wendy's and you're really hungry -- like, three-patties-just-won't-cut-it hungry -- go ahead and order the Grand Slam, which is four patties stacked on a bun. This option is only available at select Wendy's, and it's also known as the Meat Cube. 6. Several places, including McDonald's and In-N-Out, will serve you the Neapolitan milkshake. It's just what it sounds like -- chocolate, vanilla and strawberry shakes layered in a cup. 7. In-N-Out Burger's ""secret menu"" isn't so secret these days -- in fact, they've posted it on their Web site. But in case you're not in the habit of surfing fast food Web sites, here's the skinny on their rather un-skinny items: ordering something ""Animal Style"" at In-N-Out means you're going to get it with lettuce, tomato, a mustard-cooked beef patty, pickles, extra spread (it's sort of Thousand-Islandy) and grilled onions. You can even get your fries Animal Style. Mental Floss: Why is it called ""Thousand Island"" dressing? ""Protein Style"" is a burger wrapped in a lettuce leaf instead of a bun. A Grilled Cheese is two slices of American cheese, lettuce, tomato and spread on a bun (grilled onions if you so choose). And you can get just about any combo of meat and cheese that you want if you order it like you're ordering lumber: 3×3 gets you three beef patties and three slices of cheese, 4×4 gets you four of each, and so on. According to photos posted at SuperSizedMeals.com, one gluttonous patron requested and received a 100x100 at a Las Vegas store a few years ago. One item not listed on the Web site secret menu: the Flying Dutchman, which is two slices of cheese sandwiched between two patties, hold the bun. 8. Feeling a little health-conscious at Popeye's? If you are, you really should have gone somewhere else. But there's a little hope for you -- ordering ""naked chicken"" will get you breading-free poultry. The word is that this is on the menu at some Popeye's, but not all of them, although it is an option at all of them. 9. Like Chipotle, Taco Bell will make you just about anything within reason as long as they have the ingredients for it. Since most of the food at Taco Bell is made out of the same basic items, that means you can probably ask for most discontinued items and get them. One ""secret,"" though, is that they have a not-advertised green chili sauce at most locations, and apparently it's excellent. 10. Some Subways will still make you the popular pizza sub from the 1990s. Once the chain decided to make their focus healthy eating, the pizza sub disappeared from the menu in most places (the word is that Canadian and Mexican Subways still offer them on a regular basis). But if you ask, lots of places will still make it for you. Be warned, though -- Jared would not approve of the nine slices of pepperoni and copious amounts of cheese slathered in marinara sauce.

"(CNN)  -- Sue Compton is having a pretty sweet day. She's a newly minted millionaire, courtesy of her Pillsbury Bake-Off win, announced live Wednesday morning on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show."" Her original recipe for Mini Ice Cream Cookie Cups took top honors in the 44th annual contest. The winning baker said it wasn't a stove-slaving process of trial and error for her. ""Just once and done. For real. It just came together and I'm very lucky."" She sought inspiration from the list of potential ingredients required by Pillsbury -- eligible recipes must include two, in specified minimum quantities -- and wandered the aisles of her local market. ""The ideas came as a result of trying to combine ingredients I thought would taste good together,"" she said. iReport: Share your bake sale memories and recipes . Compton said she doesn't anticipate getting tired of serving up her now-signature dish -- ""I like desserts a lot, and you don't see people getting tired of cookies or ice cream"" -- or making a foray into the professional baking arena. ""I don't see living my life any differently. I'd just like to put the money toward my retirement."" The Delanco, New Jersey, woman took the top prize by whisking past stiff competition like Evelyn Henderson's Salmon Pecan-Crusted Tartlets, Kellie White's Zesty Lime Fish Tacos and Niki Plourde's Tomato Basil Eggs Alfredo in Bread Baskets. Contestants, who must be amateurs, have been tossing their toques into the ring since the Bake-Off's inception in 1949. That year, Theodora Smafield of Rockford, Illinois, took home $50,000 for her No-Knead Water-Rising Twists recipe -- a sum doubled from the advertised $25,000 pot by a promotional token that she'd run across two months before. Though her initial win stirred a national obsession with the contest, it still took 44 years for a man -- Kurt Wait -- to rise to the top with a Macadamia Fudge Torte in 1996. The finished dishes are judged on taste, appearance, creativity and consumer appeal. Here is the winning recipe for Mini Ice Cream Cookie Cups: . Servings: . Makes 24 tartlets .

Dip the end of a wooden spoon handle in the sugar and carefully press into the center of each cookie to make a 1-inch-wide indentation. Cool completely in a pan for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix walnuts and remaining 2 teaspoons of sugar, then set aside. In a small microwaveable bowl, microwave chocolate chips uncovered on high for 30 to 60 seconds, stirring after 30 seconds, until smooth.

"Warsaw, Poland (CNN) -- Polish legislators were planning Wednesday to hold a June election to choose a successor to President Lech Kaczynski, whose death in an air crash is generating unprecedented scenes of public grief. Mourners lined up through the night outside Warsaw's Presidential Palace to pay respects to Kaczynski, whose body is lying in state alongside that of his wife. However, amid national unity in the wake of the disaster, there were the first signs of discord with protests reported over a decision to bury the late president and his wife in a crypt previously reserved for monarchs and saints. The couple were among 96 Polish dignitaries, military top brass and officials who died when the plane carrying them to a service commemorating Polish prisoners of war massacred in Russia during World War II crashed in bad weather. Their bodies were repatriated earlier this week. Caskets carrying 30 more crash victims were returned to Poland on Wednesday aboard a military jet from Moscow. Draped in Polish flags the caskets were lined up side-by-side by an honor guard during a solemn ceremony at Warsaw's airport. iReport: Share your photos, video and stories with CNN . The disaster has caused shockwaves through Poland, with thousands of people waiting up to eight hours to pay their respects to the first couple. Due to overwhelming demand, the palace was opened to the public through the night. A line of up to 15,000 mourners, many dressed in black and carrying pictures of the deceased first couple, could be seen snaking through the center of Warsaw Wednesday. Images of Poland's collective grief . ""I think this is really unique to Poland,"" U.S. ambassador to Poland, Lee Feinstein told CNN, adding that the devastation to the country's leadership was unparalleled in the contemporary world. Feinstein described Poland as one of the United States' ""staunchest"" allies, largely thanks to military support for U.S.-led operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to be among international figures attending the first couple's funeral service in Warsaw, scheduled for Saturday. The Kremlin in Moscow said Russian President Dmitry Medvedev would also attend. The service will be followed by the couple's burial on Sunday in Krakow's Wawel Castle. The archbishop of Krakow said burying the late president in the historic crypt was the country's way of honoring him. ""I think in this way the Polish nation wants to include him among the greatest and most revered men in Polish history,"" Stanislaw Dziwisz said on Polish state television. There have been reports of protests in Krakow over the decision, while debate has raged online as to whether Kaczynski, seen as unpopular prior to his death, should be buried in a national heroes' cemetery in Warsaw rather than at Wawel. Biography: Lech Kaczynski . A Facebook group opposed to the castle burial had garnered 32,000 followers by late Wednesday. According to Poland's PAP news agency, a date for the election that will choose Kaczynski's successor will be announced on April 21 by acting President Bronislaw Komorowski. The agency said the date was likely to be June 13 or 20.

"(CNN) -- An 11-year-old boy is facing adult charges in the shooting death of his father's pregnant girlfriend, authorities said Saturday. Police say Kenzie Marie Houk's daughter found her shot to death in her bed on Friday. Police say the boy shot Kenzie Marie Houk, who was eight months pregnant, once at point-blank range in her farmhouse in western Pennsylvania. The boy, whose name was withheld by CNN because he is a juvenile, was charged with one count each of criminal homicide and homicide of an unborn child in the death of Houk, 26, Lawrence County District Attorney John Bongivengo told CNN. Houk's 4-year-old daughter found her in her bed Friday, according to police. The child alerted landscapers working near the home, who then called authorities.  Watch a community in shock » . ""This is something that you wouldn't even think of in your worst nightmare, that you'd have to charge an 11-year-old with homicide,"" Bongivengo said, according to CNN affiliate WTAE. ""It's heinous, the whole situation."" Under Pennsylvania law, anyone over the age of 10 accused of murder or homicide is charged as an adult. If convicted, the boy faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, Bongivengo said. Authorities said the boy is the son of the victim's live-in boyfriend at the home in Wampum, about 35 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. ""At this point, we don't believe it's accidental,"" Bongivengo said. The weapon was a youth model 20-gauge shotgun, designed for use by children, that belonged to the boy, according to investigators. Bongivengo told reporters the household has no history of child abuse, but that an investigation is ongoing. Calls to the boy's public defender, Dennis Elisco, went unanswered Saturday.

"SAN FRANCISCO (CNET) -- Google plans to unveil a service called Google Voice on Thursday that indicates Google wants to do with your telephone communications what companies such as Yahoo have done with e-mail. Google unveils a phone service Thursday in which the search giant acts like a phone middleman. Google Voice, the new version of the GrandCentral technology Google acquired in July 2007, has the potential to make the search giant a middleman in an important part of people's lives, telephone communications. With the service, people can pick a new phone number from Google Voice; when others call it, Google can ring all the actual phones a person uses and handle voice mail. The old version could let people centralize telephone services, screen their calls, and listen to voice mail over the Web. But the new version offers several significant new features, though. Google now uses its speech-to-text technology to transcribe voice mail, making it possible to search for particular words. Gmail's contacts now is used to instruct Google Voice how to treat various callers. And Google Voice now can send and receive SMS text messages and set up conference calls. Existing GrandCentral users should get the option to upgrade Thursday, and Google plans to offer it to the public after ""a number of weeks,"" said Craig Walker, product manager of real-time communications and head of Google Voice. As interesting as the service itself, perhaps, is that Google plans to offer it at no cost. Google is in the midst of a profitability push, trying to wring more money from existing sites, adding advertisements to properties such as Google Maps, Finance, and News that previously lacked them, and canceling many projects such as Google Lively that didn't pass financial muster. With Google Voice, though, the company is showing more of its earlier, more patient approach. ""Our goal is to be able to offer it to people for free,"" Walker said in an interview at Google's offices here. Asked what the revenue model is for Google Voice, he offered only an indirect answer: ""Let's get a bunch of happy users engaged in Google properties and getting their voice mail through this. Google gets value out of having happy Google users."" Money isn't completely absent from the picture. The company does charge for international calls, and it wouldn't rule out advertising in the future. GrandCentral has appeared largely dormant from the outside since the Google acquisition, leading some to spotlight it as an example of a promising technology that was squelched by an acquisition. But, Walker said, there was plenty of work going on behind the scenes. ""In addition to innovation, there's been a process of getting migrated and integrating with the Google infrastructure,"" he said. One big possible difficulty for people could be the issue of changing phone numbers. People's phone numbers can form a piece of their identity, in particular with home phone numbers held for years and number portability making it possible for people to keep their mobile phone numbers even if they change carriers. Even leaving aside the issue of the hassle of changing phone numbers, sharing your Google Voice number means committing your telephony to Google's services. Another possible hitch is offering phone numbers that match where people actually live or work. Here, Google hopes to have things under control, though there were no numbers in the 415 area code for my test of the service. ""Our goal is to offer numbers to virtually everyone who wants to sign up. There are a finite number of numbers in the U.S., but we haven't reached anywhere near depletion,"" Walker said. ""We hope to have a pretty good footprint (for area code choices) so that people will have really good choices."" Google Voice, hands on . Overall, I found Google Voice to be potentially useful, with the most compelling option the imperfect but still very useful transcription. The first promise of Google Voice is to simplify your phone communications. You don't have to worry about which number to hand out to people, and if you're sitting with your cell phone next to you home or work phone, you can choose which to answer. If you have the ""screen calls"" option enabled, Google Voice will tell ask you if you want to accept the call or send the person to voice mail. (Google Voice asks first-time callers to identify themselves.) In practice, virtualizing your profusion of real-world phone numbers with one that redirects is handy. You can set various preferences--for example, calls from your family members get a custom answering message; calls from your parents don't ring your work number; and calls from your spouse are answered directly when you pick up the phone rather than run through the Google Voice options such as answering the call, sending it to voice mail, or listening in on the voice mail. But I thought Google Voice's most promising aspect is voice mail transcription. Today, voice mail is a something of black hole for me. It's a pain to check, and I just tell people to send me an e-mail if they get my voice mail. When I'm on the road or at home, I check my e-mail much more frequently than my voice mail. And e-mail means I have their contact information and a record that they contacted me, all in a handy form that shows up through search. Transcription brings some of these advantages to voice mail. Because Google Voice e-mails you the text as soon as it's ready, you can quickly scan it to see if it's important. That's a lot less obtrusive than calling your voice mail system in the middle of a meeting. Also, reading the text lets you quickly home in on the caller's phone number without having to wait through the whole message. On clever phones such as the Apple iPhone or T-Mobile G1, the phone number is highlighted in the e-mail so you can click it to call back, too. However, the text-to-speech conversion is imperfect, to say the least--for example, it thought ""Steve and Mary"" was ""Steven Mary."" And here's an amusing sample of one transcribed voice mail I left myself: ""hey i'm just testing the grand central transcription service to see if it really can do a good tax to speech recognition and that they believe in bed that's little voicemail and a web page because what would not be exciting what time you get in bed a voicemail on the web page."" The Web site uses bolder type for words it's more sure of, so you can make better guesses about . Walker said it takes roughly 30 seconds to translate a 30-second voice mail, which is pretty good turnaround. My timing test of a rambling, 1:45 voice mail took just almost exactly twice that time to show up translated in my inbox, though the voice version was available over the Google Voice Web site almost immediately. Shallow Gmail integration . You don't need a Gmail account to use Google Voice--any Google account will do--but if you have one, you can customize the system's behavior for existing groups or individuals. When a message from an unknown number arrives, you can save it with the caller's name through the Google Voice interface, and it will show up in your Gmail contacts, too. A ""contacts"" tab at Google Voice borrows heavily on the Gmail contacts tab. However, Google left me wanting deeper integration. Where are Gmail's filters and labels? Google Voice is a big step toward the long-promised utopia of unified communications, but instead it presents me with a new inbox to check. When I asked Walker whether Google Voice would be unified with Gmail more thoroughly, he wouldn't say, but indicated it's on Google's to-do list. ""There are a host of things we're working on,"" Walker said. ""We want to get the core telephony from GrandCentral to Google Voice, to get that ironed out first."" Even where there is integration, for example with the Gmail contacts page, there are some shortcomings. For example, I have a Gmail mailing list for ""family,"" and I doubt I'm not the only one. My wife is a member of the list, but Google Voice by default opted to use the settings for its ""friends"" category. Apparently the reason for the issue is that Google Voice is case-sensitive: it created its own ""Family"" group, with an uppercase F, that has no members in it. Changing my existing group to ""Family"" in Gmail merely created two groups with that name, so to work around the issue I copied all the ""family"" members to ""Family."" I deleted the original to avoid the messy annoyance of keeping the two identical groups synchronized. Tussling with carriers? Another interesting possibility, given Google's Internet expertise and Google Voice's Web-based interface, would be to offer direct calling using VOIP (voice over Internet Protocol). Google Voice already has the potential to shift some of the customer relationship and valuable services from phone service companies to Google, and offering VOIP service would increase that potential. Walker wouldn't comment that possibility, though he did point out that Google Voice can work with the Gizmo VoIP service. For the regular public switched telephone network, people still have to spend money with AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Vodafone, and others. ""The point was to allow your existing services to work better together,"" Walker said. ""You have to come with your own underlying phones and services for it to work."" © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc.

"Mojave, California (CNN)  -- Billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson on Monday unveiled the winged rocket his company developed to give paying customers a brief taste of space. The 300 people who have given Branson's Virgin Galactic $20,000 deposits toward the $200,000 space-ride tickets were invited see SpaceShipTwo in its Mojave, California, hangar. CNN was given an early peek. The first flight in 2011 -- after 18 months of testing -- will launch from a spaceport under construction in New Mexico, Branson said. Another aircraft will carry the 60-foot-long SpaceShipTwo to 60,000 feet above the Earth, where ""they will drop away and they will then go to 2,000 miles per hour in 10 seconds, where they get propelled into space,"" Branson said. Its hybrid rocket motor -- still under development -- will reach a suborbital altitude high enough to reach the edges of space and weightlessness, according to Branson. ""Once in space, [passengers] will unbuckle their seats,"" he said. ""There are enormous windows, which no spacecraft has had before, for them to look back at the Earth. They can float around and become astronauts."" The cabin, which seats six paying passengers, is 90 inches -- nearly 8 feet -- in diameter, which provides ""lots of room for zero-G fun,"" Branson's Web site said. The first voyage will carry Branson, his wife, mother and children, the entrepreneur  said. ""Actually, that's my mum on the side -- a younger version of my mum on the side of the spaceship,"" he said. After just a few minutes of space tourism, SpaceShipTwo will glide back to Earth, landing where it began the trip in New Mexico, he said. About 80,000 people have placed their names on the waiting list for seats on SpaceShipTwo and its successors. ""What we want to be able to do is bring space travel down to a price range where hundreds of thousands of people would be able to experience space, and they never dreamed that [they] could,"" Branson said. He said he hopes the technology will lead to a new form of Earth travel, jetting people across oceans and continents faster through suborbital routes. ""We would love at some stage, obviously subject to government approval, to take the engineers and start looking at shrinking the world,"" Branson said. The spacecraft was based on the technology and carbon-composite construction developed for SpaceShipOne, which won the Ansari X Prize in 2004 for the first privately funded human flight to the edge of space. The reusable spacecraft is a joint effort by aviation designer Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites and Virgin Galactic, a space tourism venture that is a subsidiary of Branson's Virgin Group.","Billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson unveils spacecraft .

"What do Spiderman, Al Capone's silk boxer shorts and a waterproof hiking jacket have in common? Spider silk is being used in pioneering research to regrow damaged bones and teeth . Answer: they are all, in their own way, helping to push forward the boundaries of modern medical science. More specifically, two separate research teams in the U.S. have been using materials normally associated with clothing (and a certain arachnid superhero) to provide novel, high-tech solutions to age-old health problems. At Tufts University, Massachusetts scientists are pioneering a method of manipulating spider silk to genetically engineer new bone tissue, thus allowing them -- in theory -- to re-grow damaged bones and teeth. At Rush University, Indiana, meanwhile, a team of cardiologists are trialing a device made of Gore-Tex -- the waterproof fabric used in much outdoor clothing -- to help repair holes in the human heart. The Tufts research, headed by Professor David Kaplan of the Department of Biomedical Engineering, is focusing on ways of using silk -- or rather the constituent proteins of which silk is made -- to create a hybrid material that can then be used as a ""scaffold"" on which to grow new bone and tooth cells. Why silk? Because not only is it extremely tough -- its tensile strength is six times that of steel fibre of an equal diameter -- but also bio-compatible, meaning it does not cause an adverse reaction when introduced into the human body. ""We are playing around with silk from silk worms,"" one of Kaplan's collaborators, Professor Carole Perry of Nottingham Trent University in the UK, told CNN, ""But the bulk of our work is using fusion proteins derived from spider silk."" The science is complex -- osteogenic differentiation, chimeric proteins and novel nanocomposites are just a few of the terms involved -- but the basic idea is that, working at a molecular level, you combine elements of silk protein with those of some other protein with desirable properties to create the building blocks of an entirely new material. This material -- precisely what form it will take is as yet uncertain -- will then be used to fill a hole or a break in a bone or a tooth, acting as a ""scaffold"" on which stem cells taken from elsewhere in the patient's body can grow to form replacement tissue. Because silk is also biodegradable, the scaffold would then dissolve away over time like sutures, leaving just the new bone. ""It's an important step in the process of trying to grow replacement body parts,"" Professor Christopher Viney of the University of California, Merced -- an expert in the mechanical properties of silk -- told CNN. ""Right now if you want a replacement part you need a donor, but this sort of technology is one piece in the jigsaw of growing your own replacement. The health implications are potentially huge."" The work being carried out at Rush University is not, on the face of it, quite as scientifically ground-breaking as that of Professor Kaplan and his team. If successful, however, it could prove every bit as significant. As with Kaplan, the Rush team -- led by cardiologist Dr. Ziyad Hijazi -- is adapting an everyday material to a novel medical application. In this case the material is a variation on waterproof Gore-Tex, known as Gore-Helex. The latter has been fashioned into a minute, umbrella-shaped device -- the snappily-named Gore-Helex Septal Occluder -- that can be used to plug a Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO), a common hole found in the upper chambers of the heart of one in five Americans. Although in itself not necessarily dangerous, a PFO can be for stroke victims. ""We are proposing that closing the hole will be more effective in preventing stroke relapse than taking medications for the rest of your life,"" Dr. Hijazi told CNN. Although an Occluder-style device has already been used successfully for some years in plugging Atrial Septal Defects, another type of heart hole, these are the first official randomized trials to ascertain its effectiveness in cases of PFO. ""It comes in three different sizes,"" explains Dr. Hijazi, ""Twenty, 25 and 30 mm, and is passed through an incision in the groin up through an artery into the heart, where we position it using a microscopic camera. ""The operation takes 45 minutes, the patient is awake throughout and goes home the next day. ""Given that PFOs are implicated in approximately 40 percent of strokes in the U.S. -- about 120,000 people -- this technology could make a very big difference."" Gore-Tex hearts and silk bones -- fashion will never seem quite the same again.","Everyday fabrics are being used in ground-breaking medical research .

"New York (CNN) -- Former President Bill Clinton left the hospital Friday morning after doctors performed a procedure to restore blood flow in one of his coronary arteries, longtime friend Terry McAuliffe told CNN. Clinton, 63, was hospitalized at New York-Presbyterian Hospital's Columbia campus after experiencing brief periods of discomfort in his chest over several days, according to Dr. Allan Schwartz, the hospital's chief of cardiology. Two stents were used to restore blood flow to a coronary artery Thursday after images revealed that a bypass graft -- part of a quadruple bypass surgery that Clinton underwent in 2004 -- was blocked, Schwartz said. An electrocardiogram and a blood test showed no evidence of a heart attack, Schwartz said. ""If I know Bill Clinton, he's going to get right back on the phone,"" McAuliffe, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN on Friday. ""Yesterday as they were wheeling him into the operating room, they literally had to take the phone out of his hand as they were wheeling him in to surgery. ""He was on a conference call dealing with Haiti. And I guarantee you as soon as he gets back today he'll be back on the phone."" Schwartz said the need for the procedure had nothing to do with Clinton's post-bypass diet or exercise, which Schwartz called excellent. Rather, Schwartz said, this is ""part of the natural history"" of the bypass treatment. ""He really toed the line in terms of diet and exercise. He really followed the program,"" Schwartz said, adding he told Clinton that he'd be allowed to return to work Monday. The stents have opened the artery that the blocked bypass graft was supposed to service, Schwartz said. Stents are tiny balloons that are threaded into a patient's heart vessels where they are inflated, pushing plaque against the vessel wall and increasing blood flow. The graft's blockage isn't unheard of, because that particular type of graft has a 10 percent to 20 percent failure rate after six years, Schwartz said. However, a bypass graft at a different artery -- the main artery in the front of Clinton's heart -- still looks ""pristine,"" Schwartz said. ""We know from multiple studies that if that bypass is open at this point ... it will remain open,"" he said. Stents and chest pain explained . Schwartz said Clinton was up and walking about two hours after Thursday's procedure. In a written statement, Douglas Band, counselor to the former president, said: ""President Clinton is in good spirits and will continue to focus on the work of his foundation and Haiti's relief and long-term recovery efforts."" Clinton's daughter, Chelsea Clinton, and wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were with him at the hospital Thursday night, Schwartz said. Hillary Clinton was scheduled to leave Friday on a planned trip to the Middle East, but her departure has been delayed until Saturday, a senior U.S. official said. Bill Clinton hasn't left the public eye since he departed the White House in 2001, maintaining an active schedule devoted to global philanthropic interests and speeches. Since the January 12 earthquake that hit Haiti, he has traveled there twice in his latest role as the U.N. special envoy. On February 3, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon placed Clinton in charge of overseeing aid and reconstruction efforts there. Clinton also attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January. David Gergen, CNN senior political analyst, said Clinton was ""exhausted"" and had a cold after returning from his second trip to Haiti earlier this month. Clinton had busy schedule before heart procedure . Clinton's 2004 surgery was performed at the same hospital where he was admitted Thursday. Doctors in 2005 operated again on Clinton to remove scar tissue and fluid that had built up after his bypass surgery. Dr. Spencer King, president of St. Joseph's Heart and Vascular Institute in Atlanta, Georgia, rejected as outdated suggestions that Clinton needs to slow down. ""This is kind of a '50s concept,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview Thursday. ""Now, we've got a lot of fantastic ways to prevent progression of heart disease -- medications, things that can be done. The outlook for people is totally different."" ""If he slows down, he slows down,"" said King, who who has not treated Clinton. But, he added, ""It would be very hard to show any data that would tell you he'll have more trouble if he hangs it up."" King said Thursday's stenting procedure may not be the end of Clinton's heart woes. ""The problem there is that that vein graft is developing disease and sometimes it goes on and develops more,"" he said. ""There's a substantial chance over the next three, four, five years that it could close up again."" CNN's John King, Ed Henry, Jessica Yellin, Elise Labott and Elizabeth Landau contributed to this report.","NEW: Clinton leaves hospital Friday morning, former DNC chairman says .

"(CNN) -- Heavy snow pummeled much of the East Coast on Wednesday, battering states for the second time in a week and forcing many people to stay home from school and jobs. Several cities had record snowfalls. The storm canceled or delayed flights in several cities, kept federal workers home for a third straight day in Washington, and taxed local government budgets as cities and counties scrambled to pay for snow removal, overtime, salt, supplies and equipment. In Washington, the snow was falling at a rate of 2 inches per hour at one point in the afternoon, CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said. Forecasters predicted that Washington winds would gust to 50 mph overnight. A blizzard warning was to be in effect in the Washington area until 7 p.m., the National Weather Service said. Blowing snow caused such poor visibility at midday that snowplows temporarily parked by the side of the road, authorities said. Forecasters predicted that the storm would dump a total of 8 to 10 inches inside the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495), with higher amounts to the north. Watch the forecast on the storm's trek . ""Even if you're in a SUV, it's difficult to get around,"" Washington Police Chief Cathy Lanier said. ""You can't see the Capitol dome through the snow,"" even standing a few yards away. Share your winter weather photos, videos . Government buildings were eerily quiet. The Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service buildings were shut. No one answered the door at the Justice Department, though the attorney general's office said work was still being done at key counterterrorism offices. The U.S. Postal Service said it was experiencing delays in processing mail. Subway service was expected to be limited Thursday to underground stations, and bus service was expected to be suspended on Thursday. Federal agencies were to be closed Thursday, too, and non-emergency employees were to be granted the day off. This winter already has become the snowiest on record for Washington and its suburbs, as well as Baltimore, Maryland, and Wilmington, Delaware, the National Weather Service said. It's also on pace to become the snowiest season on record in other cities, including Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Blizzard warnings also were in effect Wednesday for Asheville, North Carolina; Newark and Atlantic City, New Jersey; Baltimore, Maryland; Dover, Delaware; New York and nearby Long Island; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Under a blizzard warning, the following conditions are expected to be seen for three hours or longer: wind speeds of 35 mph or more and considerable falling and/or blowing of snow with visibility near zero (less than one-fourth mile), the weather service said. In Atlantic City, the landmark Boardwalk -- lined with shops, restaurants and casinos -- remained open despite the snow. New York was to be under a blizzard warning until 6 a.m. Thursday, but the snow was expected to stop falling late Wednesday night. Forecasters predicted wind gusts up to 50 mph and predicted the city will have received 12 to 20 inches of snow by the time the storm ends. In Pennsylvania, all of Interstates 76, 78, 83, 176, 476 and 676, as well as state road 581, were closed Wednesday because of blizzard conditions, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation said on its Web site. Part of I-81 was closed, it said. Interstate 80 near Clearfield, Pennsylvania, was shut after two pileups -- one involving 17 cars and the other involving seven cars, said Rich Kirkpatrick from the state's Department of Transportation. One person died and another person was seriously injured, police said. Philadelphia was under a blizzard warning until midnight, and could have as much as 20 inches of snow by the time it stops, forecasters said. In Boston, Massachusetts, snowfall rates of 2 to 3 inches an hour were expected along the Interstate 95 corridor into the evening. A winter storm warning was in effect until 1 a.m. Thursday, with final snow totals of 5 to 10 inches, the weather service said. Thousands of flights were delayed or canceled to and from airports in Baltimore, Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, airlines reported. East Coast storm grounds thousands of flights . ""We're working, and we're plowing as best we can, and then once the winds diminish some, we'll be able to start hauling snow off the airfield as we've been doing for six days now,"" said Tara Hamilton, spokeswoman for Washington Dulles International and Reagan Washington National airports, both of which closed Wednesday. The airports did not plan to reopen until about 7 a.m. Thursday. New York area airports were operational Wednesday afternoon, but airlines canceled most flights in and out of LaGuardia, Newark Liberty International and John F. Kennedy International airports. Rajesh Moorjani, one of the stranded travelers at the Newark, New Jersey, airport, had flown from India on Tuesday night, intending to get a connecting flight to California. On Wednesday, he was getting used to the idea of being stuck on the East Coast for a day, CNN affiliate WABC reported. ""I'm just kind of trying to get in touch with old classmates, ex-colleagues ... trying to put a message on Facebook saying: 'If anybody is in New York, let's get in touch,' "" he told WABC. WABC: Storm socks New Jersey . Amtrak was still providing limited service for Boston, New York and Washington. But most passenger rail service south of Washington was canceled. ""The massive storm has resulted in downed trees and power lines on portions of CSX freight railroad tracks south of Washington resulting in continued service cancellations in Virginia, and the Carolinas,"" the rail line's Web site said. Bus travelers fared no better. ""Pretty much everything out of Virginia, New York, D.C., etc. at this time has been canceled,"" said Maureen Richmond, director of media relations for Greyhound, which transports 22 million passengers per year. ""We're operating where we can, based on weather and road conditions,"" she said. She urged would-be passengers to call the company's ticketing line. Due to improved weather conditions in the Chicago, Illinois, area, airlines were reporting no delays at O'Hare and Midway International Airports. Many businesses in Greenwich, Connecticut, about 30 miles northeast of New York City, closed early Wednesday, in part to allow workers to travel home before the worst of the storm hit. Diane Garett planned to keep her bookstore open, but she gave her employees the day off, WABC reported. ""I just felt it was just safer if they stayed home,"" she told WABC. ""Plus a lot of their children are home from school. So I didn't think it was right to ask them to come to work."" Hardware store owner Troy Usnik was taking somewhat of a breather Wednesday in snowy Philadelphia. The owner of 10th Street Hardware said he sold well over 100 shovels and 200 to 300 bags of salt Tuesday. ""Today seems kind of quiet, but there was a mad rush yesterday. Sales were brisk. Last night was a panic and everyone who didn't have it came out to buy shovels and salt."" Early Wednesday, the snow turned to sleet in Philadelphia, but roads were passable and buses were driving along emergency routes, Usnik said. The National Weather Service predicted 9 to 13 more inches of snow. New York deployed 1,600 salt spreaders to care for 65 miles of roads, CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano said. The winter of 2009-2010 has become the snowiest on record for: . • Baltimore, which has received at least 72.3 inches of snow this winter . •  Washington, where Dulles airport has received 72 inches of snow this winter and Reagan National airport has received 54.9 inches . •  Wilmington, Delaware, which has received at least 59.5 inches of snow this winter, breaking its previous record of 55.9 inches.

"(CNN) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada on Thursday apologized to South Korea for the more than three decades when Japan ruled over Korea, calling the time a ""tragic incident."" Okada made the rare apology during a joint news conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan, Korean state-run media reported.

During that time, Japan's military is accused of forcing about 200,000 women, mainly from Korea and China, to serve as sex slaves. They were known as ""comfort women"" for soldiers in Japan's Imperial Army. There have been street protests and lawsuits in that past in South Korea over the sufferings of the comfort women.

"(CNN) -- Much of the United States was braced for severe winter weather on Monday, as a major storm hit California while an unrelated first round of wintry conditions snarled commutes in the Midwest. The storm hitting California Monday afternoon was expected to affect weather across the country through Wednesday. The wintry weather, caused by a weak disturbance over the Midwest, caused the deaths of three people in weather-related traffic accidents Sunday and Monday. The first two occurred Sunday in northern California, the area first hit by the weather. A 14-year-old boy died on Interstate 80 about 11 a.m. Sunday when the truck he was traveling in skidded off the road on a steep snow-covered grade, said California Highway Patrol spokeswoman Jeanie Hoatson. A second person was killed on State Route 89 about 45 minutes later when the vehicle they were driving went out of control and collided with a second vehicle, she said. In Indiana on Monday, a 21-year-old man died on Interstate 65, northwest of Indianapolis, state police said. The man was involved in one of two weather-related crashes on the road as snow fell, and was struck by a semitrailer truck when he stepped out of his car, Indiana State Police said. Numerous traffic accidents were reported in states experiencing winter weather conditions as the disturbance moved across and into the Midwest, affecting Ohio and Wisconsin. Forecasters warned that the approaching storm could cause widespread power outages through Wednesday and make travel nearly impossible in some areas. It may spread arctic air southward by midweek. Some parts of Iowa could receive up to 10 inches of snow, according to CNN affiliate KCCI. The state already received up to 5 inches of snow from the disturbance Sunday. Chicago, Illinois, received about an inch of snow through Monday morning, said CNN iReporter Alan Hawkins. The sun came out and began to melt the snow, but by late morning the sky was overcast again. More cold temperatures and snow are forecast for Tuesday and Wednesday, he said. ""Today's just kind of a taste of what we're going to get."" CNN iReporters in Kentucky and Indiana reported snow, but said it was melting as of late morning. Is it snowing where you live? Send photos, video . Some snow also fell in mountainous areas of Arizona early Monday as the major storm moved in. Winter storm warnings stretched as far south as Tucson. Blizzard warnings are in effect for parts of the central Rockies and the Mogollon Rim in Arizona, where up to 2 feet of snow and wind gusts of 50 mph could cause whiteouts, forecasters said. Wind chills of 30 to 40 degrees below zero are forecast for the Midwest and the northern Plains, and afternoon temperatures may be in the single digits through Wednesday. The storm is forecast to intensify Monday as it strikes California and heads northeast toward the Rockies, forecasters said Sunday. Winter storm warnings are in effect for the Sierra Range southward to the San Bernardino mountains in Southern California. The area was set to experience heavy snow on Monday, with up to 3 feet possible in the higher elevations. Southern California may get wind gusts of 60 mph on Monday, which could damage trees, power lines and communication towers. Heavy rains were also forecast, triggering possibilities of mudslides and debris flows especially in burn areas. The storm is expected to intensify Tuesday as it moves northeast into the Midwest and upper Great Lakes. Winter storm watches are in effect for the regions, with blizzard conditions possible in northern Iowa and southern Minnesota on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the storm will move into southern Canada as the coldest air of the season spills across the central United States, forecasters said. Many temperatures will be below zero Thursday morning and daytime highs will struggle to make it out of the single digits across the upper Great Lakes, according to forecasters.

"(CNN) -- A marijuana bust along the U.S.-Mexico border revealed 30 pounds of the drug stuffed into framed pictures of Jesus Christ, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency said Wednesday. ""This is not the first time we have seen smugglers attempt to use religious figures and articles of faith to further their criminal enterprise,"" said William Molaski, port director of the agency's office in El Paso, Texas, in a statement. ""What some might find offensive or sacrilegious has unfortunately become a standard operating procedure for drug smugglers. This would include using religious symbols, children and senior citizens in their attempts to defeat the CBP inspection process."" Authorities said a 22-year-old woman in a Jeep from Juarez, Mexico, told federal border patrol officers that she had nothing to declare besides the framed art. The officers checked out the vehicle with Cesar, a federal drug-sniffing dog, who alerted them to three framed pictures of Jesus in the vehicle. The officers pulled the backing of the pictures and found numerous bundles, authorities said. The woman was arrested. The bust was one of three marijuana seizures made Tuesday at the El Paso point of entry. Officers said they seized 214 pounds of marijuana in the two other busts.","Bust at U.S.-Mexico border reveals marijuana stuffed into framed pictures of Jesus .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea moved a step closer to breaking Manchester United's stranglehold on the English Premier League title with a controversial 1-0 victory at home to Bolton Wanderers on Tuesday night. Nicolas Anelka headed the only goal against his former club just before halftime to put the London side four points clear of three-time defending champions United with four matches to play. Third-placed Arsenal can leapfrog United into second place with victory over London rivals Tottenham on Wednesday and be three points adrift of Chelsea. Bolton, just five points above the relegation zone, were angry after not being awarded a penalty in each half for alleged handball by Didier Drogba and John Terry -- but were lucky not to concede more goals as Chelsea dominated late in the match. ""They weren't claims for a penalty,"" Bolton boss Owen Coyle told match broadcaster ESPN. ""They were stonewall penalties. I knew it at the time. ""Didier Drogba is a world-class player, but looking at this replay he could be a world-class volleyball player. ""I've asked the linesman about [the Terry incident] after the game but he's said it hit his shoulder. He needs to take another look at that."" Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti chose not to comment on the incidents. ""It is not my job to judge the work of the officials,"" the Italian said. ""It is a difficult job, sometimes they make the right decisions, sometimes they make bad decisions. ""We have to maintain this level. We are doing well, we are very focused and in a very good position, but we have a very difficult game on Saturday against Tottenham and we have to do our best to win that game."" Chelsea were less impressive in the first half, and it took until the 43rd minute before France striker Anelka broke the deadlock with a close-range header from Drogba's left-wing cross for his first goal since January. Bolton striker Kevin Davies had told reporters before the match that his former teammate Anelka was unhappy playing with Drogba, but the duo combined well to end Wanderers' stubborn resistance. The recalled Salomon Kalou should have made it 2-0 in the 54th minute but goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen blocked the Ivory Coast forward's shot with his legs. Davies was booked for a crude tackle on Jon Obi Mikel in the 77th minute, and Frank Lampard hit the post soon after with a fierce low shot after a clever dummy by Kalou's replacement Joe Cole. England midfielder Cole gave Chelsea fresh impetus, with Michael Ballack heading his cross tamely at Jaaskelainen. Terry drove a shot just wide from a corner but soon after was beaten in the air at the other end by Bolton substitute Johan Elmander -- however, the Swede's header went wide. Cole should have doubled the lead in injury-time, but somehow stumbled over Yuri Zhirkov's low cross when it seemed easier to score. Meanwhile, Inter Milan moved into the final of the Italian Cup with a 1-0 victory away to Fiorentina on Tuesday night, winning 2-0 on aggregate. Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o scored the only goal in the 57th minute to keep Jose Mourinho's team in the hunt for three trophies this season. The Champions League semifinalists, who drew 2-2 with Fiorentina at the weekend, will face either new Serie A leaders Roma or Udinese in the title match. Also on Tuesday, Cagliari sacked coach Massimiliano Allegri after the Sardinian team's slump to 12th in the Italian top flight following a haul of just two points from nine matches. Allegri was voted Serie A coach of the year by his peers for guiding Cagliari to ninth place last season, but became the 16th to be dismissed this campaign.","English Premier League leaders Chelsea move four points clear of Manchester United .

"(CNN)  -- In a messy drug bust this week, investigators uncovered more than 700 pounds of marijuana stuffed in a septic tank truck full of human waste, Arizona police said Friday. And the search of the truck was as awful as it sounds. ""Yeah, that really does suck,"" Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Bart Graves told CNN. ""It's a long way to go to make a bust."" Hidden in the holding tank of the truck were 743 pounds of pot, worth about $409,000 on the street, police said in a news release. An officer pulled over the septic tank truck Wednesday after a check of the license showed it was invalid, police said. The truck was headed northbound on I-19 and stopped about 35 miles south of Tucson, Arizona. Police patrolling the area tend to be more vigilant, Graves said, because the interstate -- which leads directly to Mexico -- is a major thoroughfare for drug and human trafficking. After the stop, the officer discovered that the commercial vehicle markings on the truck were also invalid. A subsequent search revealed the bales of marijuana in red and orange packages amid the waste. ""It just shows how desperate these drug cartels are,"" Graves said. ""They'll go to any lengths to conceal their product. We've seen it concealed [among] watermelons, bell peppers. This is the first time we've seen it concealed in human waste."" Police arrested the driver, Leonard Salcido, 24, of Tucson, and charged him with possession of marijuana, possession of marijuana for sale and transportation of marijuana, police said. The bust was not the largest for Arizona police. In 2008, police found more than 2,000 pounds of marijuana in a fake UPS truck, Graves said. Wednesday's smelly pot was just one major bust this week. On Thursday, police confiscated $681,000 worth of methamphetamine concealed in the false floor of a vehicle. The driver was stopped for speeding on I-17 near Camp Verde, Arizona, police said. The officer asked to search the vehicle and found 15 pounds of meth, police said.","Police stopped truck on interstate, about 35 miles south of Tucson, Arizona .

"(CNN) -- A British couple kidnapped by Somalian pirates in the Indian Ocean have issued another desperate plea, saying they are being badly treated and need urgent help. Paul and Rachel Chandler, from Kent in southern England, were taken by pirates from their yacht, the Lynn Rival, on October 23, just days after setting sail from the Seychelles islands for Tanzania. The couple was brought ashore and are being held in separate locations in central Somalia. Their captors initially demanded a ransom of $7 million, but the British government -- in line with longstanding policy -- has refused to pay. In a video filmed on Thursday in Somalia by the French news agency AFP, Rachel Chandler begged the British government to help secure the couple's release. ""Please help us, these people are not treating us well,"" she said. ""I'm old, I'm 56 and my husband is 60 years old. We need to be together because we have not much time left."" A doctor was shown examining Paul Chandler, 60, who appeared to be in a better state than his wife. The medic found Rachel Chandler in poor mental health, calling out for her husband, AFP reported. ""She is sick, she is very anxious, she suffers from insomnia,"" Dr. Mohamed Helmi Hangul told the agency. ""She's very confused, she's always asking about her husband -- 'Where's my husband, where's my husband?' -- and she seems completely disorientated."" Paul Chandler said his conditions were poor and also pleaded for help. ""Please help us, we have nobody to help us, we have no children... We have been in captivity for 98 days and we are not in good condition,"" he said, also on Thursday. Hangul said Paul Chandler ""had a bad cough and seemed to have some fever."" A spokesman for the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office told CNN on Sunday: ""We are monitoring the situation very closely and doing everything we can to help secure a release. ""We remain in regular contact with the family and are providing support. We call for the safe and swift release of Paul and Rachel."" Pirates have been very active off the east coast of Africa in the past several years, operating out of lawless Somalia. Earlier this month, pirates attempted to hijack an Indian crude oil vessel 105 nautical miles from Somalia, the EU's anti-piracy naval force said. The pirates opened fire on the ship and were later arrested. Piracy on the high-seas reached a six-year high in 2009, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors shipping crimes.

"Washington (CNN) -- Union leaders, the White House and congressional Democrats have agreed to limit the reach of a tax on high-end health insurance plans that would help pay for a proposed overhaul of the U.S. health care system, union leaders involved in the talks said Thursday. The proposed thresholds for taxing health plans will be raised from $23,000 to $24,000 for families and from $8,500 to $8,900 for individuals, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told reporters. Dental and vision benefits won't be counted toward that amount after 2014, he said. Health plans covered by union contracts would not be subject to the 40 percent tax until 2018 -- a transition period union leaders said is comparable to those offered to other private insurers. The threshold for taxing other plans will be adjusted by 1 percent above the annual rate of inflation, and plans involving large numbers of women or the elderly will get breaks as well, Trumka said. The changes will reduce the $150 billion expected to be raised over 10 years by about $60 billion, he said. And union plans would be able to enter the health care exchanges set up under the bill in 2017, he said. The tax on what have been dubbed ""Cadillac"" health care plans is a key feature of the Senate health care bill, but it has drawn opposition from Democrats in the House of Representatives and from unions. President Obama, who has made health care his top priority in Congress, supports the excise tax as a way to contain the rise of health-care costs. Trumka and other top  union officials have held a series of talks at the White House for the past three days as congressional negotiators tried to merge the two bills together. He warned earlier this week that congressional Democratic candidates could risk losing labor's support if the final bill included a tax on high-cost health plans. But he said that despite all-but-total Republican opposition in both houses of Congress, supporters of health care reform stood ""on the threshold of a milestone."" ""We don't look at this as the end of our fight for real reform, but another step along the way in the quest for real reform,"" Trumka said. Labor leaders said the changes they negotiated would help not only union members, who make up about 12 percent of the U.S. work force, but all working families. But Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, dismissed the plan as ""a sweetheart deal."" ""Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to this bill,"" he said. ""Another sweetheart deal isn't going to turn that around."" A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Thursday found much stronger support for the financing plan in the House bill, which would impose a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge on incomes higher than $500,000 for individuals or $1 million for couples. The survey found 61 percent of the public favors the House provision, while the Senate bill drew 29 percent support. Trumka told reporters that leading Democrats were behind the compromise. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said she had not seen anything in writing Thursday evening. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Connecticut, a leading opponent of the excise tax, said the proposal was more fair than the current Senate bill. ""However, the devil is in the details, and I will reserve judgment on any compromise until I have had the time to review the proposal,"" he said in a written statement. Obama did not directly address the plan as he addressed reporters ahead of a House Democratic Caucus meeting Thursday night. But he dared Republicans to run in the November midterm elections on a platform of rolling back ""something that Washington has been talking about since Teddy Roosevelt was president."" ""If Republicans want to campaign against what we've done by standing up for the status quo and for insurance companies over American families and businesses, that is a fight I want to have. If their best idea is to return to the bad policies and the bad ideas of yesterday, they are going to lose that argument."" Democratic negotiators planned to return to the White House late Thursday. A senior leadership aide said Democratic leaders and White House officials want to send the bulk of the health care package to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office for a cost estimate soon -- even as soon as the end of this week. The aide said the controversial issues of abortion and immigration are not likely to be resolved by then, but because they would have no impact on the cost of the bill, negotiators could work out those details separately. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said negotiators are working to get agreement on the overall health care package by the end of this week. ""That's been the goal. But it's a goal, it's not a deadline,"" Hoyer said. CNN's Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh, Ted Barrett, Lisa Desjardins and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","AFL-CIO chief says threshold for taxing high-end health insurance plans will rise .

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's top legal official ""misled"" the government over the case for war in Iraq under pressure from then prime minister Tony Blair, a former Cabinet minister claimed Tuesday. Clare Short, who was Blair's international development secretary until she quit over the Iraq invasion, said Attorney General Peter Goldsmith withheld his own ""doubts and changes of opinion"" in giving the go-ahead for war. ""I think he misled the Cabinet. He certainly misled me, but people let it through,"" Short told an inquiry into Britain's role in the March 2003 Iraq invasion. The inquiry -- Britain's fifth examination of its Iraq involvement -- has already grilled senior figures including Blair, former defense minister Geoff Hoon and Britain's top military commander Jock Stirrup. Short said that Goldsmith, who last week testified before the inquiry that he was initially ambivalent but later adamant over the legality of the war, was wrong to press the case. Goldsmith initially advised Blair in January 2003 that it would be unlawful to invade Iraq without a United Nations Security Council resolution but changed his mind a month later. ""I think for the attorney general to come and say there's unequivocal legal authority to go to war was misleading."" Short said Goldsmith was ""leaned on"" by Blair to agree to the war. ""Lord Goldsmith said he was excluded from lots of meetings -- that's a form of pressure. ""It was suggested to him that he go to the U.S. to get advice about the legal position. ""You have got the Bush administration who have very low respect for international law. It seems the most extraordinary place in the world to go to get advice about international law."" She added: ""I think all that was leaning on -- sending him to America, excluding him and then including him."" Her comments came just days after Blair appearance at the inquiry generated protests, with several hundred anti-war campaigners gathering outside the London venue chanting ""Blair lied, thousands died"" and other slogans. Blair denied claims he had struck a secret deal with U.S. President George W. Bush in 2002 pledging British backing for the invasion and said he believed ""beyond doubt"" his unfounded pre-war claim that Iraq was capable of launching chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes. Blair: No 'covert' deal with Bush over Iraq . Analysts say involvement in the Iraq war remains a ""live political issue"" in the UK, because the same government -- now led by Gordon Brown -- was still power, whereas the parties of other leaders in the U.S. and Australia have been voted out of office. ""The others have faced critical public scrutiny and been damaged by that,"" legal expert Glen Rangwala of Cambridge University told CNN. ""The British haven't had a change of administration so in many ways it remains a live political issue because it reflects on people who are in government.""

"(CNN) -- Two new missile production plants opened in Iran on Saturday.   The inauguration of the production lines for the anti-helicopter Qaem missile, and the anti-armor Toofan-5 (Hurricane) missile, came three days after Iran test-launched a rocket capable of carrying a satellite, a launch deemed a ""provocative act"" by Washington. The Defense Ministry told Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency that both missiles have ""high penetration and destructive powers."" By mass producing and delivering these modern arms, Iran's department of defense aims to increase its ground and air defenses, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. The announcement of new missile production coincided with a 10-day period marking the 31st anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed shah. ""Toofan 5 is one of the most advanced missiles. It has two warheads which can destroy tanks and other armored vehicles,"" Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi told Fars. The Qaem is a ""missile which can destroy targets in the air traveling at low speed and at low altitude, especially assault helicopters,"" Vahidi added. The laser guided anti-helicopter Qaem rocket is designed to resist enemy actions in electronic warfare. Iran is embroiled in a dispute with the West over its nuclear program and often makes announcements of progress in its military capabilities. The West suspects Iran of trying to build nuclear bombs, but Iran says its program is for peaceful power generation. On Friday, Iran's foreign minister said he believes a solution will be reached over a proposed deal to export uranium for enrichment abroad, a demand of Western nations that worry that Tehran plans to use its program to build nuclear weapons. ""The amount of uranium [for export] is negotiable. But I am confident that a solution can be found,"" Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Iran's state-run Press TV reported. Earlier this week, Iran's atomic energy chief said no deal had been struck to export uranium for enrichment. ""The discussions are still being conducted, and we will inform the nation of any final agreements,"" said Ali Akbar Salehi, director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, on Wednesday according to the state-run Iranian Labour News Agency. Asked what countries in addition to France and Brazil were under consideration, he said it was an Asian country but would not name it. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has told Press TV that Iran would have ""no problem"" turning over most of its low-enriched uranium to the West for further enrichment. Iranian diplomats had initially accepted the idea, which was proposed by the West, but then rejected a plan put forth by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the atomic watchdog of the United Nations. ""In our opinion, there are no issues with the exchange"" of 3 percent to 5 percent enriched uranium for 20 percent enriched uranium, Ahmadinejad said. He added that, if the West were to refuse to return the enriched fuel, world opinion would shift. ""If they don't live up to their agreement, the international atmosphere will change in our favor,"" he said. ""They [Western countries] can come and build 20 nuclear power plants for us; Russia, France and the United States can come and sign contracts and build the power plants. It serves our interests as well as theirs. Of course if they don't come to do this, we will reach a point to build our own power plants."" Mottaki on Friday said Ahmadinejad's comments show that the Islamic republic is ""eager"" to discuss the proposal. Iran insists its nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes.","The West says it suspects Iran is trying to build nuclear bombs .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. senator is calling for a federal probe into the system of background checks for employees at nuclear plants after learning that a suspected al Qaeda member from New Jersey worked at five such sites. ""We simply cannot tolerate at any time having someone with terrorist ties working at a nuclear plant, period,"" Sen. Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a written statement Saturday. ""It seems like common sense, but clearly we need to tighten up the system."" The FBI said earlier this week that it is investigating Sharif Mobley, a 26-year-old from Buena, New Jersey, as a suspected member of al Qaeda. Mobley also is accused of shooting and killing a security agent and severely injuring another while trying to flee the Republican Hospital in Sanaa, Yemen, last weekend, a law enforcement source said last week. Mobley's father said Saturday, ""My son is no terrorist."" He would not comment further. Mobley worked at nuclear plants operated by PSEG Nuclear for different contractors from 2002 to 2008, doing routine labor such as carrying supplies and assisting with maintenance activities, company spokesman Joe Delmar said Thursday. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said it was working with the FBI to determine whether Mobley had access to any sensitive areas of the nuclear plants where he once worked, spokeswoman Holly Harrington said. ""It's important to note that for him to even be in the plants, he'd have to undergo a background and criminal history check,"" she said. She said Mobley worked at five plants between 2002 and 2008 in ""labor [and] maintenance kind of positions."" Schumer said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspector general should conduct an ""immediate and thorough review"" of its procedures for background checks on new and transfer employees. The senator said the monitoring of current employees needs improvement. He said the current background checks include an examination of criminal and employment histories, a psychological assessment and behavioral observation. However, ""the NRC delegates the authority to complete background checks, which results in a certain degree of disparity in how checks are carried out, and what information is ultimately covered,"" Schumer's statement said. He said the checks are not required to cover such information as past travel and ties with other countries. Yemeni counterterrorism forces rushed to the scene and captured Mobley, who had barricaded himself in a hospital room, said Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy in Washington, on Thursday. Mobley remains detained in Yemen after the incident at the hospital. Yemeni authorities detained him and 10 other al Qaeda suspects this month in a ""successful security sweep"" in Sanaa, the capital, Albasha said. Mobley had been transported to the hospital over the weekend for medical treatment, Albasha said. He would not elaborate. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Carol Cratty, Jeanne Meserve, Mike M. Ahlers and Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","Senator calls for probe into background check system for nuclear plant workers .

"(CNN) -- A California sex offender suspected of abducting a girl in 1991 and keeping her captive for 18 years is suffering from ""serious mental illness,"" defense attorneys say in court papers. ""It appears that Phillip Garrido has been hearing [the] voices of angels for years,"" said documents filed Wednesday in El Dorado County Superior Court. The court papers dispute prosecutors' asserting that Garrido is a  ""master manipulator"" who is still trying to influence his victim. Garrido, 58, and his wife, Nancy, are charged with 29 felony counts in the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard, who was 11 when she was snatched from the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe, California. She was 29 when found in August at the Garridos' home in Antioch, about 120 miles from her home. Prosecutors allege that Garrido fathered two daughters with Dugard during her captivity. Both Phillip Garrido, who was a registered sex offender on parole at the time of his arrest in August, and Nancy Garrido have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. In a filing earlier this month, prosecutors called Garrido a ""master manipulator,"" citing journal entries made by Dugard. They also said Garrido's attorneys were attempting to contact Dugard, whose location they are trying to keep secret, and asked the court to impose a protective order barring such contact. A judge refused to immediately grant the request, setting a hearing for Friday. Garrido's public defenders, Rick Meyer and Susan Gellman, said Dugard, who is identified in court papers as Jane Doe, told investigators following Garrido's arrest that he had a ""self-described ability to understand the voices of angels. ... One of the children disclosed this as well, describing how the voices would keep him up at night, and how the angels lived underground and spoke to him from this location."" The filing points to Garrido's ""manifesto,"" entitled ""Origin of Schizophrenia Revealed,"" which he prepared in the days and weeks before his arrest and addressed to the FBI. He took it ""from law enforcement agency to law enforcement agency, calling attention to himself in a way that could [and ultimately did] lead to his arrest,"" the attorneys said. Garrido went to the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, accompanied by his two daughters with Dugard, to get a permit to stage a demonstration of his ability, the documents said. University employees brought about his arrest after contacting his parole officer, saying they thought Garrido's behavior was odd. ""Mr. Garrido's illness was not subtle at all,"" the documents said. ""Obviously the campus police at the University of California, Berkeley were able to perceive the clear signs of mental illness and took some action instead of ignoring them."" Prosecutors, the defense said, have discussed the ""cover stories"" told by Dugard and the children when Garrido was summoned to the parole office the following day and questioned. Authorities maintain such lies were evidence of Garrido's manipulation, according to the documents. ""In reality, it appears that everyone was very frightened by what could happen. They were afraid they would be separated and lose each other,"" the defense said. ""Even the children made up stories; there was a sense of panic. They were trying to protect each other. One of the children was so nervous she got sick."" Asked several times who was the father of the children, Garrido told several different stories, his attorneys said. ""The agent's report is helpful in showing how manipulative Mr. Garrido is not."" Further evidence of Garrido's mental illness is his repeated contact with the news media, according to his attorneys. ""Contacting the media against the advice of counsel when one is facing criminal charges as serious as these shows an inability to cooperate with counsel and an inability to appreciate the function of the criminal justice system,"" the attorneys said. ""In short, Mr. Garrido's contacts with the media, when his attorney tells him not to have them, are not manipulations at all, but evidence that he may not be competent to be a defendant."" Garrido believes that Dugard is part of his ""transformation"" and his ""disclosure,"" the documents said. ""Mr. Garrido believes that he and Jane Doe once had a plan to launch a Web site wherein Mr. Garrido's ability to speak to angels would be revealed to mankind. He remains confused as to why that has not happened."" The attorneys said they had not attempted to contact Dugard, but sent a letter to her former attorney without knowing he was no longer representing her. Prosecutors said a sentence in that letter, conveying that Garrido harbored no ill will toward Dugard or the children and ""loves them very much,"" was interpreted as a manipulation attempt. Defense attorneys maintained it was not. ""There has been no intimidation or harassment of any kind,"" they wrote. Authorities maintain Dugard does not want to speak to Garrido or his attorneys. She has that right, the defense attorneys said, and the court can refuse to disclose her location. ""However, in a case like this, it would make settlement far more difficult if counsel were forever foreclosed from approaching the idea of contact again,"" the attorneys said. If the court will not disclose Dugard's location, they requested a representative be appointed for communication purposes.","Defense says Phillip Garrido is mentally ill, hears angels' voices .

"(CNN)  -- Toyota Motor Corp. has recently been in the hot seat after issuing massive recalls because of problems related to the accelerator pedal in several of its auto models. To date, 8.1 million vehicles worldwide have been recalled by the manufacturer, with the possibility of more to come after Thursday's announcement by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration of a formal investigation into brake problems with the 2010 Prius. As the company's woes continue to mount, there has been some speculation from critics such as Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, as to whether Toyota's recent problems with sudden unintended acceleration go beyond the problems already identified. Speaking on Wednesday to CNN's Campbell Brown, Larry Webster of Popular Mechanics magazine spoke at length on the problem, saying that ""in the last decade, there have been tens of thousands of reports of sudden unintended acceleration in cars made by all the manufacturers."" Is this true? The CNN Fact Check Desk wondered: Which other car manufacturers have had a problem with sudden unintended acceleration? • Sudden unintended acceleration occurs when a car continues to move forward, often at increasing speeds, without the driver pressing on the accelerator pedal. • While Toyota is basing its current recall on the possibility of floor mat entrapment and sticky accelerator pedals, many factors can contribute to the problem of sudden unintended acceleration in vehicles. Reports from the NHTSA have blamed it on many other factors, including frayed throttle cables and cracked cruise-control computers. • The top five manufacturers of cars driven in the United States are General Motors, Toyota, Ford, Honda and Chrysler. • The NHTSA's online database indicates that every one of these five has received numerous consumer complaints of sudden unintended acceleration in more than one of its models. Each manufacturer has faced a formal investigation into these complaints by the NHTSA and as a result has had to recall vehicles to fix various conditions that led to the problem. • Recalls due to incidents of sudden unintended acceleration are not limited to the big five manufacturers. According to the NHTSA database, recalls have also been issued for vehicles made by Nissan, BMW, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Mercedes-Benz, Kia, Mazda, Land Rover, Suzuki and Volvo. • In December 2009, Consumer Reports published an article that said 41 percent of the sudden acceleration complaints received by the NHTSA in 2008 pertained to Toyota and its luxury brand, Lexus. Ford came in second behind Toyota with 28 percent of the complaints relating to U.S. models. • Bottom Line: Sudden unintended acceleration is not a problem limited to Toyota. Many car manufacturers, including the other four with the largest shares of the U.S. market, have had to recall vehicles because of this issue.","8.1 million vehicles worldwide have been recalled by Toyota .

"(CNN) -- Pirates have released a Greek-owned vessel and its crew of 22, months after hijacking it off Somalia, authorities said. The MV Filitsa was released Monday after the shipping company that owned it paid a ransom, said Michael Battzoglou, a security officer and spokesman for the owner, Order Shipping Co. He did not say how much had been paid. ""All are well and safe,"" he added. The Greek coast guard also said no one had been killed or injured on the vessel. The European Union's anti-piracy task force NAVFOR issued a statement confirming that the ransom had been paid and the ship freed. It did not say how much money changed hands. The Filitsa was en route to Mombasa, Kenya, where it and its crew were to be checked over, then will continue to Durban, South Africa, Battzoglou said. Its progress will be monitored by NAVFOR, the task force said . The bulk carrier was hijacked on November 11 off Somalia, near the islands of Seychelles, and was held at the pirate stronghold of Hobyo, on the Somali coast, the EU said. It was en route from Shuaiba in Kuwait to Dubai when it was hijacked. It flies a Marshall Island flag and is crewed by 19 Filipinos and three Greeks, the EU added. The EU mission's main tasks are to escort merchant vessels carrying humanitarian aid for the World Food Programme, to protect vulnerable ships in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean and to deter and disrupt piracy. The coast off lawless Somalia has become a hub for piracy in the past several years. Three ships have been attacked in the region this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau. There were dozens there last year, the agency said. The pirates normally seek payment to release the ships.","NEW: EU anti-piracy task force NAVFOR confirms ransom had been paid .

"(CNN)  -- The torch for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics was lit in a ceremony at the ancient Greek site of Olympia on Thursday, less than four months ahead of the games' opening ceremony. Actress Maria Nafpliotou, as a high priestess, lights the flame for the Vancouver 2010 Olympics on Thursday. The torch will be carried on an eight-day trip through Greece, the birthplace of the Olympics, before being transported to Canada for what will be the longest domestic torch relay in the games' history, officials said. Women dressed in white togas performed a ceremony on the green hillside at Olympia, the home of the Olympic flame and the place where the ancient Olympics took place. A woman playing the role of a high priestess lit the flame by sunlight focused on a mirror, the only way by tradition it can be lit. That fire then was used to light the Vancouver Olympic Torch, which Greek skier and three-time Olympian Vassilis Dimitriadis then carried on the first leg of its journey through Greece. ""The Olympic torch and flame are the symbols of the values and ideals which lie at the heart of the Olympic Games,"" International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge said before the ceremony. The torch will carry a message of peace throughout the world, he said -- words echoed by Vancouver 2010 Chief Executive John Furlong. ""Today we build a bridge between ancient Olympia and young Canada,"" he said. ""Canada is a country with a welcoming spirit and a glowing heart. ... We will do all we can to be a shining example of the ideas and values that were first kindled here in this hallowed place."" After its 1,351-mile (2,180-kilometer) trip through Greece, the torch will be taken to Canada. On October 30, the first of 12,000 torchbearers will begin carrying it through Canada on what will be a 106-day, 27,900-mile (45,000-kilometer) relay. ""It will be the longest domestic relay in Olympic history, just to be sure every Canadian will be given the right to dream and celebrate,"" Furlong said. The torch relay is derived from ancient rituals in Olympia, where torch and relay races were popular festival events and where heralds traveled throughout Greece to announce the games. The torch for the 2010 Winter Games was designed by transportation and aerospace company Bombardier, a Vancouver Olympic sponsor. The lean curves of the white torch were inspired by the lines carved in the snow by winter sports and by the ""undulating beauty of the Canadian landscape,"" the company said. The torch's special construction will allow it to burn through a range of winter weather, including snow, rain, sleet, wind and subzero temperatures, Bombardier said. It weighs 3.5 pounds (1.6 kilograms) fully fueled, the company said. The flame is due to arrive in Vancouver, British Columbia, on February 12 when the opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Games will be held at the domed BC Place Stadium.","Olympic flame due to arrive in Vancouver, British Columbia, in February .

"(CNN) -- No play can begin in a baseball game until the pitcher throws the ball. And no play can conclude until the umpire makes the call. ""We're not just robots they send out there,"" umpire Tim McClelland (2nd from L) told author Bruce Weber. Yet these figures -- the man on the mound and the men who stand in judgment -- are vastly different in importance to the average fan. There are countless children who dream of becoming a major-league pitcher. He is, literally, the king of the hill. Umpires? Almost nobody dreams of becoming an umpire. And yet the positions share a number of similarities, according to two new books: ""As They See 'Em"" (Scribner), by New York Times writer Bruce Weber, and ""The Complete Game"" (Knopf), by former major-league pitcher (and current New York Mets broadcaster) Ron Darling. Both jobs require a great deal of command, neither gets enough training, and both are often disrespected by others in the game. Indeed, despite a library of books by and about pitchers (Jim Bouton's ""Ball Four,"" Jim Brosnan's ""The Long Season,"" Christy Mathewson's ""Pitching in a Pinch""), Darling said he believes that people still don't understand what it takes to stand on that mound. ""Within baseball circles there is a common baseball axiom, 'If pitchers weren't so stupid, hitters would never get a hit,' "" he said in an e-mail. ""Of course, I knew this was a fallacy so I decided to write about the travails of major league pitchers. Throwing a ball 95 mph to tin cup-sized quadrants sounds pretty difficult to me, and I wanted to express this to the reader."" Umpires, on the other hand, rarely get written about at all -- in fact, they're often treated as less than human. (""The owners basically see them like bases,"" former baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent told Weber. ""They say, 'We need a base; we need an umpire; same thing.' "") Weber found a fraternity (and they are almost all men) much like cops or soldiers: tight-lipped believers in baseball law and order. Weber immersed himself in the ""land of umpires,"" as the book's subtitle calls it, attending umpiring school, calling games at various levels of pro ball and talking with those who were willing -- including the legendary Doug Harvey, who was called ""God"" for his imperious demeanor. What he found is that what looks so obvious on television at home is often a challenge on the field, a matter not just of eyesight but positioning, rule-book knowledge and basic guts. ""That's really what [being an umpire] is about -- is being in charge,"" he said. ""If there's anything that characterizes the major league umpire, it's that special kind of chutzpah."" Umpires need that presence because they're often baseball's most disrespected men. Aside from the vitriol they face -- the managers kicking dirt, the spectators yelling ""Kill the ump"" -- they're second-guessed by broadcasters and barely tolerated by management, as Weber reveals in detailing the episodes preceding and following the 1999 umpires' strike. And yet Major League Baseball doesn't participate in umpire training or development, entrusting it to two umpire-run private schools, Weber observes. (MLB does run an annual umpire camp.) Darling echoes Weber's concerns in his own field, pitching. In these days of strict pitch counts and injury concern, pitchers are ""undertrain[ed],"" he says, noting that top draft choices climb the ranks ""never allowed to throw more than 110 pitches."" That leaves them at a disadvantage when they have to go deeper into a game or cope with a tough inning, he says. ""It would be like training for the marathon and never running more than 5 miles,"" he says. ""Identifying and preserving million-dollar arms are [the purview] of doctors, not baseball people."" Darling's book is a chronicle of pitchers' thought processes, using individual innings from his pitching or broadcasting career to make his point. He talks about panic overtaking a pitcher, as it did for Darling in a 1984 game in which he got pasted by the Cubs; he also addresses the rush of pitching in a World Series game and -- in a treat for baseball fans -- goes over the extra innings in perhaps the most famous college baseball game ever, a 1981 extra-inning contest that Darling's Yale Bulldogs lost to Frank Viola's St. John's Redmen, 1-0. He says he remembered the games vividly. ""I definitely watched tapes and read box scores, but I was very clear on almost all the minutiae of the good old days. A little scary and maybe a major personality flaw!"" Pitchers get more support than umpires, of course. Darling observes that the relationship between a pitcher and his catcher during a well-pitched game ""is one of sport's most beautiful dances. I would not have said it when I was playing, but after a shutout ... there is a love for that person immediately after the process. You did something together that could not have been done alone, and nobody can understand what you went through to get there."" Umpires, too, take pride in their best moments, though few pay attention outside their fellow umpires. More common is to be vilified for missed calls. Weber devotes a moving passage in his book to a conversation with the retired Don Denkinger, a 29-year veteran remembered by fans (if he's remembered at all) for a wrong call in the 1985 World Series. Though time has dulled the pain, ""I think he lives with [that call] every day,"" Weber said. ""When a dreadful thing happens to you in front of so many people and you become famous for it, it must be devastating."" Weber says his time with umpires has made him much more sympathetic to their judgmental tasks. When watching games now, the Yankees fan says, he'll focus on the umpires. ""I just think umpiring is interesting. People hate 'em, and they somehow perceive of umpiring as a flaw in the game, but I don't,"" he said. ""Now I'm always interested who the umpires are."" Which is a point the umpires would appreciate. ""Umpires are people, too,"" veteran ump Tim McClelland told Weber. ""We have families; we have emotions. ... Somebody says, 'Kill the umpire,' and people go, 'Heh, heh, that's funny,' but in order to do that, you have to disassociate the umpire from the person. ""We're human. We're not just robots they send out there.""","""As They See 'Em"" is in-depth look at baseball umpires .

"(CNN) -- Floyd Mayweather Jr. has said he is ready to make the big-money fight with newly crowned WBO welterweight world champion Manny Pacquiao happen. After victory in Las Vegas over Puerto Rico's Miguel Cotto on Saturday, Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach said the ""whole world"" now wanted to see a fight with Mayweather. Reacting to the proposition the undefeated 32-year-old, who formerly held the WBC title at welterweight, told British broadcaster Sky Sports: ""If he wants to fight Floyd Mayweather all he has to do is step up to the plate."" The twice-voted Ring magazine fighter of the year added that he felt Pacquiao's approach was one-dimensional but the Filipino would be a favorite with the crowd. ""The thing is with Pacquaio I don't see any versatility as a fighter; he's a good puncher but just one-dimensional. Is Pacquiao the greatest? ""The world's going to go 'wow' if Floyd Mayweather gets beaten. That's what everyone is looking to see. ""If I beat Manny Pacquaio do you know what they are going to say? 'You are supposed to beat him, you are Floyd Mayweather, you are the bigger man'. If I knock him out they'll say 'you're supposed to knock him out he's been knocked out before'. ""I'm in a no-win situation and when I beat him no one is going to be surprised because he's been beaten before; whatever I do to Pacquaio has been done before - he's been beaten on three occasions. And if I knock him out I don't want the world shouting because he's been knocked out twice before."" If the fight goes ahead it is expected to challenge the mark set by Oscar De La Hoya's bout with Floyd Mayweather for the most profitable in history. Money generated from pay-per-view subscriptions earned the two fighters an estimated combined total of $77 million in 2007. Mayweather, whose nickname is ""Money,"" said: ""If I go out and make $60-75 million in one night; come on - I'm not losing.""","Manny Pacquiao is the new WBO welterweight world champion .

"London, England (CNN) -- Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky has won his libel case against a Russian broadcaster in a London court, his spokeswoman told CNN Wednesday. The tycoon, who now lives in exile in Britain, was disputing a 2007 report by the All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company (VGTRK), which claimed Berezovsky was behind the 2006 poisoning death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko. The High Court in London awarded Berezovsky £150,000 ($223,400) in damages, according to Berezovsky's spokeswoman, Jennifer Morgan. ""I have no doubt that, in making this program, the purpose of RTR and the Russian authorities was to undermine my asylum status in the U.K. and to put the investigation of (Alexander) Litvinenko's murder on the wrong track,"" Berezovsky said in a statement. ""I am pleased that the court, through its judgment, has unequivocally demolished RTR's claims."" RTR is the company's satellite channel. The judgment was issued in London because RTR broadcasts to Britain. In addition to VGTRK, a Russian man, Vladimir Terluk, was also found liable for the damages because the judge found he had made the claim in RTR's report. VGTRK will not accept the ruling, company lawyer Zoya Matveyevskaya told the state-run RIA-Novosti news service. The broadcaster had previously said it would not recognize any court rulings in this case and would appeal to the European Court, saying the London court process was ""biased"" and ""politically tinted,"" RIA-Novosti reported. The High Court had demanded that VGTRK reveal its information sources, and after the TV company refused, the court banned the broadcaster from taking part in the court process, RIA-Novosti reported. Litvinenko was a former KGB agent who came to Britain in 2000 after turning whistle blower on the FSB, the KGB's successor. He claimed he had been ordered to assassinate Berezovsky. Like other dissidents in London, Litvinenko was a vehement critic of then-President Vladimir Putin and vocal about Chechen politics. He wrote a book in which he claimed FSB agents, and not Chechen rebels, carried out a series of bombings at Moscow apartment buildings and a mall in 1999 that killed 300 people. Litvinenko died at a London hospital November 23, 2006, from a massive dose of the radioactive material polonium-210. In a deathbed statement he blamed Putin for his death, something the Kremlin has strongly denied. Berezovsky sued over allegations that he was involved in Litvinenko's death, which were broadcast April 1, 2007, on RTR's news program Vesti Nedeli, or News of the Week. The program featured an interview with a man named Pyotr, who made the claim. Pyotr's identity was disguised, but the High Court judge found he was in fact Terluk, who has lived in Britain since 1999. Berezovsky made his money during the years that Boris Yeltsin was president of Russia by taking control of many state assets, from oil and car companies to property. He was part of the Yeltsin inner circle and led an extravagant lifestyle immortalized in the film, ""Oligarch."" But when Putin came to power, Berezovsky fell out of favor and found his business activities under scrutiny. He fled to Britain in 2000 and was granted political asylum in 2003. He also saw the demise of his media ambitions after his stake in Russia's major television company ORT was sold, and his own TV6 channel was closed down. Berezovsky and Litvinenko came to know each other in the aftermath of a failed assassination attempt on the oligarch in 1994. The pair maintained contact once in Britain.","Boris Berezkovsky awarded £150,000 in damages after libel case .

"London, England (CNN) -- British Airways cabin crew members went on strike Saturday, leaving thousands of would-be passengers' travel plans during the next two weeks in disarray. The strike came after British Airways Chief Executive Willie Walsh and the joint general secretary of the Unite union, Tony Woodley, emerged Friday from a meeting and announced the effort to avert the walkout had failed. ""This company does not want to negotiate,"" Woodley said of British Airways. ""This company wants ultimately to go to war with my members and the union."" Walsh said he ""deeply regrets"" the inconvenience the strikes will cause to passengers but said the company will still try to operate as many flights as possible. ""I am disappointed the union has not been able to see the sense of the proposal we tabled today,"" Walsh said. Advice for passengers . British Airways posted lists on its Web site of flights that it plans to operate during the walkout. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he ""believes that this strike is in no one's interest and will cause unacceptable inconvenience to passengers. He urges the strike be called off immediately"" and the two sides return to bargaining. In addition to the three-day strike beginning Saturday, Unite has decided to strike for four more days beginning March 27. Unite represents 95 percent of BA's 15,000 cabin crew members, but not all of them plan to strike. The airline has unveiled an ambitious contingency plan to get as many passengers as possible to their destinations. Walsh said he hopes that by leasing aircraft and using replacement workers, BA will be able to deliver about two-thirds of its customers to their planned destinations during the strikes. In a full-page ad in British newspapers Friday, Walsh said a ""significant number"" of cabin crews don't support the strike and will continue to work, supported by volunteers from across the airline. The airline said it has also made agreements with more than 60 other carriers to rebook customers free of charge if their British Airways flights are canceled during the strike period. Will a strike by British Airways affect you? But in a posting on its Web site, Unite called the schedule ""an accomplished work of fantasy."" The industrial action is over planned changes to the way cabin crews operate, which British Airways says will save the carrier more than 60 million pounds ($90 million) a year. Unite has said the plans call for working hours to be extended and crew staffing levels to be cut, changes that it has said will damage customer service and the BA brand. ""Unite believes the new contractual changes are an attempt to force staff to pay the price for management failings with the company wringing more and more out of fewer and fewer staff who will be paid less,"" the union said in a posting on its Web site. A cabin crew member's starting salary is 11,000 pounds ($16,500), Unite said. Unite said that BA management submitted a formal offer to the union last week, but the offer failed to address union concerns about crew numbers and service delivery. That prompted Unite officials to announce the strike dates. BA then rescinded its offer. British Airways submitted a new offer Friday, but Woodley said it reduced the amount of pay that had been in last week's offer. iReport: Are you caught up in the strike? A sticking point in negotiations was reportedly how BA could be compensated for the 27 million pound ($40.5 million) loss it had already incurred through canceled tickets before the talks broke down. Walsh said he told Unite that the expense must be recovered, so the financial value of Friday's offer was ""not as attractive"" as last week's. The new offer, however, would have secured long-term pay protection for all existing crew, ""new opportunities"" for BA crew at London's Gatwick airport, and modernization of its industrial relations, he said. Any BA workers who go on strike now risk losing permanently their travel perks, such as free and heavily discounted travel. ""We said to them that we will not continue to provide valuable perks and benefits to people who seek to inflict serious and ongoing damage to our business,"" Walsh said. ""It wasn't a threat. When we said that those traveling concessions will be withdrawn, that's exactly what we meant, and that's exactly what will happen."" Should BA staff lose travel perks? Unite said BA cabin crews offered changes to pay and work practices that would have saved the company more than 100 million pounds ($150 million), but that their offer was rejected. The airline's management said the proposed changes would have saved the airline less money than management's planned changes.

"Arlington, Virginia (CNN) -- The mantra in Washington during the current winter storm is ""stay home,"" but some doctors and nurses really do need to get to hospitals to take care of the sick. So, many of them rely on a group of hardy volunteer drivers for transport. Adrian Stanton was running Virginia Hospital Center's command center Wednesday morning, coordinating the driver pickups and drop-offs. He described the volunteer drivers as ""unbelievable saviors for us."" One of those volunteers is Scott Long, who left his home at 6 a.m. to pick up two nurses before heading to the hospital, where he picked up another nurse to take her home. Long initially said he does it because he thinks it's the right thing to do. But he later admitted he also does it because it he enjoys it. ""My wife can stay with the kids. I get to play in the snow and nobody can yell at me for being out driving in the snow,"" he told CNN. ""I had a police officer the first day pull up at a stoplight and yell at me for being on the road. I told him I was driving for the hospital and he laughed and said, 'Well then, have fun.'"" Long drives a 1995 Jeep Wrangler for his pick-ups. He says he likes the Jeep better than his four-wheel drive. ""The reason is the short wheel base. I can actually turn around in a single lane in traffic, whereas if I had my bigger four-wheel drive, it doesn't turn around and it's not as nimble,"" he said. As Long was making that point, his Jeep started sliding sideways along the road. But he didn't miss a beat as he regained control. ""Like where we just slid out there, the Jeep can handle it better than the truck,"" he said. The volunteer drivers are offered a gas voucher from the hospital, but Stanton said most of them turn it down. Stanton has an active list of about 30 people who drive for the hospital during inclement weather. Wednesday morning he said the drivers had done somewhere near 50 pick-ups and drop-offs in the previous 24 hours. The hospital workers appreciate the volunteer drivers. ""I didn't have any other options,"" said James Schmidt. He heard about the rides from e-mails and texts that the hospital sent to its employees. One intensive-care nurse said she had driven herself to work the past few days. ""I don't know how I made it,"" she said, adding, ""God bless"" the drivers. One night-shift supervisor named Lynne said she received a ride from Long on Thursday morning. She lives only a few miles from the hospital, but didn't think she would be able to make it home in the snow. Lynne said, ""This is worse than ..."" Long finished her sentence: ""... anything so far.""","About 30 people drive for Virginia Hospital Center during inclement weather .

"(CNN) -- Nelson Mandela: Two decades before he became the first president of a democratic South Africa, Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment in June 1974. Jailed on charges of treason and sabotage -- but fundamentally for his anti-apartheid activities -- he spent nearly 27 years in various prisons. During that time, his mother and son died, and his wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela (now his ex-wife), faced continual arrests and harassment, according to his official biography. Twenty years ago today, Mandela was released from what was known as Victor Verster Prison, near Cape Town. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and was elected president in April 1994. He will turn 92 in July. Today, although frail, he celebrated his February 11, 1990, prison release with South Africa's parliament and with millions of people all over the world.

Khamenei told a meeting of air force personnel, ""The Iranian nation, with its unity and God's grace, will punch the arrogance [Western powers] on the 22nd of Bahman [February 11] in a way that will leave them stunned."" Today is the anniversary of the day when revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini toppled the U.S.-backed government of the shah, who fled Iran. This key date in Iran's history comes amid protests by the opposition after last year's disputed presidential election, won by incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The so-called Green Movement has been protesting for social justice, freedom and democracy in demonstrations throughout the country since the June polls -- using slogans that are often identical to those heard during the 1979 Islamic revolution. Many of the recent demonstrations became violent and bloody. Two leading Iranian opposition leaders have called on supporters to protest today, the day of the anniversary. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been Iran's supreme leader for more than 20 years. As a young cleric, his political activism led to many arrests and torture by the shah's secret police -- the same shah who was supported by the United States and Great Britain.

Nicholas George: The 22-year-old senior at Pomona College in California was detained at an airport last August, handcuffed and then jailed for several hours in a holding cell. George passed through a screening checkpoint at the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, airport with a set of Arabic-English flashcards and a book critical of American foreign policy. Also, George's passport had been stamped in Jordan, where he had studied for a semester, and in Sudan and Egypt, where he'd gone backpacking. A Transportation Security Administration supervisor arrived and allegedly questioned George aggressively, asking him how he felt about 9/11, whether he knew ""who did 9/11,"" and whether he knew what language Osama bin Laden spoke. In a lawsuit filed Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Pennsylvania charge that the TSA officials, the Philadelphia police and the FBI violated George's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure and his First Amendment right to free speech. George told CNN he no longer flies with his flashcards and reading material. He said he's learning Arabic in hopes of one day helping the U.S. government. In September, Dave Davies in the Philadelphia Daily News reported that among the 200 flashcards were words like ""terrorist"" and ""explosion.""

It was 4:51 p.m. Less than 10 minutes later, an earthquake leveled much of the Haitian capital, including the Hotel Montana. Peggy Bourland, at home in Florida, saw the news on TV, popped her laptop open and fired off an e-mail: ""Please tell me you're OK."" No response. Yesterday, CNN received a copy of a message from Air Force Gen. Douglas M. Fraser to his troops, announcing that Bourland's body was found on Monday in the rubble of the Hotel Montana. He reported that Bourland's remains were transferred to Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, and met by his wife, family members and fellow service members. Gen. Fraser wrote, ""Many of you knew Ken through his outstanding work as a Caribbean Desk Officer. All of us who worked with Ken regarded him as the consummate Air Force professional, who could always be counted upon for the toughest assignment, as well as a caring teammate who went out of his way to help others and build cohesion amongst his peers."" The Bourlands had two sons and a stepson and their fifth wedding anniversary would have been in March. CNN: E-mail from Haiti, then minutes later, a nightmare . Jaimee Grubbs: The 23-year-old Los Angeles, California, cocktail waitress, whose post-Thanksgiving voice mail to Tiger Woods helped lead to the unraveling of the golf great's pristine public image, gave an exclusive interview to Los Angeles TV station KTLA. She did not deny that her relationship with Woods lasted for nearly three years. She explained that after the car crash incident outside of Woods' home, she left him a voice mail out of concern, but didn't ""think it through"" when she released it to US Weekly magazine. She said all of the subsequent attention has been tough. ""I don't like to show my emotions. I just do it when nobody's around, so my friends all think I'm solid rock, a strong person. But there are times when I get up in the morning, get in the shower, then sit there on the shower floor and cry for 30 minutes."" KTLA: Grubbs sets the record straight . What makes a person intriguing? There are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news. Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story. But every day, there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character, how they reached their decision, how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in. They arouse our curiosity. We hear about them and want to know more. What they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country. At times, there is even a mystery about them. What they have done may be unique, heroic, cowardly or ghastly, but they capture our imaginations. We want to know what makes them tick, why they believe what they do, and why they did what they did. They intrigue us.","20 years ago today, Nelson Mandela was released from prison .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Freedom lovers everywhere over a certain age recall the thrilling news 20 years ago that Nelson Mandela had been released from a Cape Town, South Africa, jail. After 27 years of isolation and hard labor, the world's most famous political prisoner emerged without bitterness, his humanity intact. When asked what he most missed while in prison, Mandela replied that it was hearing the sounds of children laughing. Now 92 and frail, Mandela has declined to participate in this week's many celebrations in his honor except one: the opening of Parliament and the address to the nation by South African President Jacob Zuma. As with all things political in this young and often raucous democracy, politicians and pundits are debating whether Mandela should have skipped this event as well. Zuma's last admission of personal misconduct, fathering his 20th child out of wedlock with the daughter of close friend, has become a national scandal and international embarrassment. Just two years ago, he confessed to having unprotected sex with an HIV-positive family friend, who then accused him of rape. In a country coping with one of the world's highest incidence of HIV/AIDS, and with a strong official commitment to gender equality, many of Mandela's most fervent admirers don't want him seen anywhere near Zuma. But Mandela went to jail not to demonstrate personal virtue but in a commitment to freedom, equality and the rule of law, which his appearance in Parliament reaffirms. Zuma is the duly elected president of a nation defined by strict allegiance to a democratic constitution. Zuma has respected the rule of law and shows no inclination to use his huge parliamentary majority to rewrite the constitution for political advantage. When Mandela was president, he defied his political advisers and voluntarily appeared before a magistrate so a claim of defamation against him could be adjudicated under due process, available to all citizens. Mandela expects no less from his successors; nor should we. Preventing abuses of power whether by a privileged minority or by an unrestrained majority is a growing challenge for South Africa's fledgling democracy. The electorate is increasingly restive over policies that have failed to reduce chronic unemployment in excess of 25 percent, curb corruption or address extreme economic and social inequities. Nor have policies been able to adequately overcome the legacy of damage caused by apartheid to family and community values, education and other basic services. The nation is struggling with a lack of respect for authority and the rule of law, especially among a growing number of alienated youth. South Africa still has many advantages, including an economy larger than the combined gross domestic products of the rest of sub-Saharan Africa minus Nigeria, and it draws talent and strength from immigrants and political refugees who have created what Kenyan political scientist Ali Mazrui calls ""the world's second global nation after the United States."" At issue is whether South Africans can uphold the minimum of shared values necessary for sustaining peace and allowing a decent society to flourish. Mandela must continue to embody the roles for South Africans that Washington, Lincoln and King serve in protecting and advancing democracy in America. And like them, Mandela's example inspires others and has become a global public good. President Obama recalls in ""Dreams from My Father"" how South Africa awakened his interest in politics as a young college student, provoking him to address a public rally for the first time and to describe events there as ""a struggle that demands we choose sides. Not between black and white. Not between rich and poor. No, it's a harder choice ... between fairness and injustice. Between commitment and indifference, a choice between right and wrong..."" Mandela rarely talks about his own character but in his autobiography, ""Long Walk to Freedom,"" says he credits any success he has achieved to a trait inherited from his father, ""a stubborn sense of fairness."" It is an ideal few have upheld to Mandela's standard -- but one we should all seek to emulate.

"Washington (CNN) -- As the new evangelist for entrepreneurship, President Obama is finally on the right track. Mentioning ""small business"" 14 times in his State of the Union address last week, he pledged to increase small business lending and provide tax incentives to jump-start new jobs. And pivoting from propping up ""too big to fail"" behemoths to boosting more nimble job generators is smart. After all, mom and pop shops, small enterprises, and garage start-ups get Americans on the payroll. Small Business Administration (SBA) data shows that small companies have generated 64 percent of net new jobs annually over the past 15 years. What's more, a Kauffman Foundation study reveals that firms less than five years old are the engine of this growth. Yet, for these businesses the recession has been particularly acute. According to a Senate report last year, American businesses with fewer than 20 employees have suffered steeper job losses than bigger companies. With unemployment hovering at 10 percent, the president must kick-start small business. In an appearance in Nashua, New Hampshire, yesterday, Obama detailed his proposed small business lending program. Let's examine his proposals: . $30 billion of federal bailout funds redirected to community banks to lend to small business. Yesterday in Nashua, President Obama unveiled his proposal to redirect $30 billion of Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds to create a new Small Business Lending Fund for community banks. To do this, the White House has said, would require an act of Congress to change current law. On Capitol Hill yesterday, White House Budget Director Peter Orszag met with severe criticism from Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), who accused the administration of viewing TARP as a ""piggy bank"" and using it for political purposes. Certainly access to credit is the lifeblood of small business and has been sorely lacking. If we are to direct funds to community banks, we must not make the same mistake twice. Federal funds must come with mandatory loan distribution requirements to ensure that banks actually lend. Better yet, Obama should channel capital to small businesses through the Small Business Administration directly. Pending legislation introduced by Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, D- Maryland, proposes funneling bailout funds through the SBA itself. The infrastructure is in place and such a process would be quicker and more efficient. At a minimum, Obama needs to empower the SBA with funding for consistent loan guarantees. As part of the Recovery Act, the SBA raised guarantees from 75 to 90 percent and eliminated fees, making it more attractive for banks to lend. This was helpful, but inconsistent funding left 1,069 small businesses on a waiting list in late 2009. Subsequent funding was extended, but this on-again, off-again fluctuation makes it impossible for small businesses to plan, and in some cases, survive. Tax credits for new hires and wage increases. The goal of this program is to encourage on-the-fence businesses to take the plunge and hire new workers. While tax credits rarely provide the reason to add new staff, for businesses anticipating growth, this nudge can catalyze hiring. As part of Obama's $33 billion tax credit proposal, employers would get a $5,000 tax credit for every net new worker hired in 2010 and reimbursement for Social Security taxes paid when they increase wages. By limiting the maximum credit to $500,000 per company, the intention is to focus on small companies, though all businesses would be eligible. Elimination of capital-gains tax on investments in small business. This is a winning proposal. For small companies seeking investment, a zero-rate capital gains tax will attract private investors who together with friends and family provide essential funding for small business start-ups. Such incentives will reward entrepreneurs who take start-up risks, and create a more level playing field for worldwide investors, as many other countries do not tax capital gains. Tax incentives for investment in new facilities and equipment. Allowing companies to write off, instead of depreciate, new equipment helps businesses buy things they were already planning to buy. Encouraging businesses to ramp up sooner accelerates job creation. In addition, Obama's State of the Union pledge to double U.S. export growth over the next five years bolsters small and big businesses alike. Real growth comes from our links with the rest of the world, and the passage of stalled trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and Colombia would open those countries' markets to U.S. goods. Promotion of free trade and the creation of a national export initiative would boost not only traditional exports, but also spark an uptick in exports of new services such as marketing or accounting services. One thing missing that would help stimulate jobs is immigration reform. Over the last decade and a half, fully one-quarter of all technology firms founded in the United States were started by immigrants; eBay, Google and Yahoo to name a few. Changing the provisions of the EB-5 visa or ""entrepreneur's visa"" to favor those who plan to start companies and extending their visas as they hire U.S. workers would spark job creation. Simply put, the United States needs global talent to help create jobs at home. Given the turbulence of the last 18 months, many small businesses remain cautious about hiring, and policy uncertainty is not helping. Health care reform, energy policy, tax policy and financial regulatory reform are all outstanding questions with significant implications for the cost of labor. Clarity on some of these issues will help businesses make hiring commitments. As Obama juggles the need to boost employment without adding significantly to our nation's debt, he is wise to focus on entrepreneurs. What he must remember is that small is big. To get our country back up on its feet, we must help small business get back to work. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amy M. Wilkinson.","Amy Wilkinson says Obama's new focus on small businesses and jobs is on track .

"Washington (CNN) -- The suicide bomber who killed seven CIA officials and a Jordanian military officer last week in Afghanistan was a Jordanian double-agent, a former U.S. intelligence official told CNN Monday. The bomber was a source who came to the base camp in Khost near the Pakistan border for a meeting on December 30, a senior U.S. official also confirmed. The man had been used by both countries' intelligence services in the past, and had provided information about high-value targets, the senior U.S. official said. ""Yes, it was a joint U.S.-Jordanian source who had provided over the period of his cooperation a lot of very detailed good information that was of high interest at the most senior levels of the U.S government,"" the former U.S. intelligence official said. The security breach occurred because the bomber was met off-base by U.S. intelligence officials who failed to search him before they put him in a car and drove him onto Forward Operating Base Chapman, the former intelligence official said. Both the Jordanian and U.S. intelligence services believed the man was loyal, according to the former intelligence official. ""Clearly there is a lot of soul searching"" at CIA headquarters in Virginia, according to the former intelligence official. The bomber was identified as Human Khalil Abu-Mulal al Balawi, from the Jordanian town of Zarqa, also home to the late Abu Musab al Zarqawi, the one-time leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, the former intelligence official said. Both the Jordanian and U.S. intelligence agencies apparently believed al Balawi had been rehabilitated from extremist views and were using him to hunt Ayman al Zawahiri, the second-ranking al Qaeda official to Osama bin Laden, the former intelligence official said. Jordanian intelligence services have long covertly cooperated with the United States, specifically in the hunt for al Zawahiri and bin Laden, because of the ability of Jordanian agents to blend into the al Qaeda organization, noted the former intelligence official. Also killed in last week's attack in Afghanistan was Jordanian Army Captain Sharif Ali bin Zeid, a cousin of King Abdullah of Jordan. The Jordanian government has not publicly commented on the specific circumstances of bin Zeid's death, but U.S. sources confirmed bin Zeid was present and was the Jordanian operative working closely with al Balawi. The CIA refused to comment Monday, saying the matter was under investigation. The bodies of the seven CIA employees were flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to a private ceremony attended by CIA Director Leon Panetta, other agency and national security officials, and friends and family. A Jordanian official who did not want to be identified said bin Zeid ""was killed on Wednesday in the line of duty as he was taking part in a humanitarian mission carried out by the Jordan Armed Forces in Afghanistan."" The Jordanian official added: ""Jordan's position in the war on terror is clear; we are fully committed to fighting al Qaeda, which is a threat to Jordan as it is a threat to the United States. We are also committed to continuing our cooperation with the United States and the international community in the fight against terror and in defeating al Qaeda."" In a posting on its Web site last week, the Taliban in Afghanistan claimed the bomber was an Afghan National Army soldier. On Sunday, however, Pakistani Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud said in an e-mail that ""we claim the responsibility for the attack on the CIA in Afghanistan."" ""The suicide bomber was a Jordanian national. This will be admitted by the CIA and the Jordanian government"" the message said. The attack occurred at a forward operating base, which a U.S. intelligence official acknowledged was a crucial CIA post and a ""hub of activity."" The main purpose of CIA forward operating bases in Afghanistan, officials have noted, is to recruit informants and to plan and coordinate covert operations, including drone surveillance and targeting. The attack was ""a huge blow, symbolically and tactically,"" because it eliminated such a large number of CIA officers, who can require years to become ingrained in the region, said Reva Bhalla, director of analysis for STRATFOR -- an international intelligence company. In addition, the attack showed the ability of the Taliban to penetrate perhaps the most difficult of targets -- a CIA base, she said. Former CIA official Robert Richer called it ""the greatest loss of life for the Central Intelligence Agency since the Beirut Embassy bombing"" in 1983, which killed eight agents. An American intelligence official vowed last week that the United States would avenge the attack. Two of those killed were contractors with private security firm Xe, formerly known as Blackwater, a former intelligence official told CNN. The CIA considers contractors to be officers. On Sunday, a local administration official and an intelligence official told CNN that two guided missiles struck a compound in the Pakistani village of Musaki in North Waziristan suspected of being a gathering place for local and foreign militants. The attack killed Sadiq Noor, a teacher; his 9-year-old son; and three people from outside the country, according to the sources, who said the missiles were believed to have been fired by an unmanned drone. There was no immediate U.S. confirmation of the missile attack.","U.S. official: Man had been used by U.S., Jordan for intelligence services .

"(CNN) -- A biology professor charged with killing three faculty members at the University of Alabama in Huntsville fatally shot her brother more than 23 years ago, but she and her mother claimed the shooting was accidental, according to documents released Sunday. Amy Bishop Anderson was 19 when she fatally shot her brother, Seth, on December 6, 1986, in Braintree, Massachusetts, according to a Massachusetts State Police report released Sunday. She was never charged in that shooting. Anderson was charged this weekend with capital murder in Friday's on-campus shooting deaths of her colleagues. She could face the death penalty. The state police report in the 1986 shooting, released by the office of U.S. Rep. Bill Delahunt, D-Massachusetts, gives an account similar to a Boston Globe story published on December 8, 2008. Delahunt was district attorney at the time; staffers said he was in the Middle East on Sunday and unable to comment on the case. Earlier this weekend, Braintree police said records from that shooting were missing, and that the department's log indicated the shooting was accidental. However, Police Chief Paul Frazier said he didn't agree with the Globe's account. The Globe's story stated that Anderson asked her mother how to unload a round from a 12-gauge shotgun and that Anderson -- then known as Amy Bishop -- accidentally shot her brother while she was handling the weapon. The article cited then-Police Chief John Polio as the source. According to the state police report released Sunday, Braintree police told state police that ""indications were that Amy Bishop had been attempting to manipulate the shotgun and had subsequently brought the gun downstairs in an attempt to gain assistance from her mother in disarming the weapon"" when it went off, shooting her brother, Seth, in the chest. But, Frazier said Saturday, ""it is a far different story I believe than what was reported back then. I cannot tell you what the thought process was behind our releasing her at the time."" An officer then involved in the case who is still working for the department told him that Anderson shot her brother during an argument, Frazier said. The officer said Anderson allegedly fired a shot in her bedroom without hitting anyone, argued with her brother, shot him and then fired another round in the home before fleeing, according to Frazier. Frazier said the teen was arrested after pointing a weapon at a vehicle near the house in an attempt to get the driver to stop, but it drove on. But during the booking process, then-Chief Polio called and told the officers to release her, Frazier said. He said her mother was at the time a member of the Braintree Personnel Board. In a telephone call with CNN, Polio, now 87 and retired, denied ever calling in the order. He said detectives including lead investigator Capt. Theodore Buker -- who has since died -- had interviewed Anderson and her mother, Judith, who is identified in the state police report as J. Bishop. Buker told him that the shooting appeared accidental and the two men agreed she should be released to her mother, Polio said. A request was then filed with Delahunt's office to conduct an inquiry, but Delahunt never did so, he said. The state police report, however, said that Buker met with a state police investigator and determined that ""due to the testimony of the members of the Bishop family, and in particular the testimony of J. Bishop, relevant to the facts concerning the death of Seth Bishop that no further investigation ... was warranted,"" the report concludes. Seth Bishop's death was listed as accidental and the investigation was concluded. Delahunt spokesman Mark Forest told CNN the state police and medical examiner concluded the death was accidental, and an autopsy was also conducted. ""The investigative reports ... did not recommend any further action,"" he said in an e-mail. Those reports were turned over to state and local authorities, including the district attorney's office, he said. Anderson's mother witnessed the shooting, the state police report said. Investigators waited 11 days to interview Anderson and her parents because of their ""highly emotional state"" following the shooting, according to the report. In the December 17, 1986, interview, Anderson told authorities she ""thought it would be a good idea if she learned how to load the shotgun in the house,"" according to the state police report. The young woman told police she was concerned for her own safety after the family home was broken into, although she previously had been afraid of the gun. She said she got the gun and loaded shells into it, but was unable to get them out. Anderson said that while she was attempting to unload the weapon on her bed, it went off. She then took it downstairs to ask for help in unloading it. She asked her brother, she said, and he told her to point the gun up instead of carrying it beside her leg. Her brother was walking across the kitchen between her and her mother, she said. She started to raise the gun, and ""someone said something to her,"" she recalled in the report. She turned and the gun went off. ""Amy thought that she had ruined the kitchen but was not aware of the fact that she had struck her brother,"" the report said. She fled, and told police she thought she had dropped the gun as she ran away. ""She cannot recall anything else until she subsequently saw her mother at the police station,"" the report said. The report does not reference any other shots fired besides the one in Anderson's bedroom and the shot that struck her brother. Anderson's father was not home at the time. He told police he had had a disagreement with his daughter ""about a comment she had made"" before he left to go shopping. He told police he had bought the shotgun about a year before the shooting, after the house had been broken into, and that he and his son belonged to a rifle club. Anderson was not trained to use the gun, he said. Anderson's mother said that when her daughter came downstairs and asked for help in unloading the gun, she told her not to point it at anyone, and that her daughter turned and the gun went off. The woman told police she did not hear the shotgun fire earlier in her daughter's bedroom and ""believed the house was relatively well soundproofed and that such a discharge would not necessarily be heard on another floor of the house."" Polio acknowledged that an argument had occurred during the shooting and said that the other shots, including one fired into the ceiling, did not appear aimed at anyone. He also recalled that Anderson had fled the scene. But, he said, he could not remember what he had told the newspaper in reference to the case or why details, including the argument, were not reported. He said Anderson's mother had worked for the personnel board and at one point was assigned to the police department. But he rejected as ""laughable"" any suggestions that the suspect's mother might have influenced their handling of the case. ""There was no cover-up,"" Polio said. ""Absolutely no cover-up and no missing records. The records were all there when I left. Where they went in the last 22 years and two police chiefs subsequent, I don't know."" Braintree Mayor Joseph Sullivan announced Sunday an effort to locate all materials associated with the shooting. ""The Braintree Police Department will conduct a thorough audit of all its records to identify if there were deficits in its past recordkeeping process,"" Sullivan said. ""It is important to note that in 1986, police records were created and maintained manually, which complicates their review and retrieval."" The Braintree shooting resurfaced after Harvard-trained Anderson was charged in Friday's shooting in Alabama. Huntsville Police Chief Henry Reyes said Saturday that Anderson was attending a faculty meeting on the third floor of the sciences building Friday afternoon when she brandished a gun and shot six colleagues, killing three. Anderson, a professor and researcher at the university and a mother of four, was arrested as she was leaving the building, Reyes told reporters Saturday. He said a 9 mm handgun was recovered from the second floor of the building late Friday. Madison County District Attorney Rob Broussard said officials were considering other charges, including attempted murder. Authorities have not ruled out the possibility of other suspects in connection to the shooting. Anderson, who is known to students as Dr. Bishop, had been working at the university since 2003, and was up for tenure, according to spokesman Ray Garner. However, authorities wouldn't discuss possible motives or whether the issue of tenure may have played a role in the shooting. Garner told CNN that the university gives teachers six years to get tenure. Those who do not get it are terminated, he said. University President David Williams said a prayer service would be held on Sunday. He said the campus would open next week for employees, but that there would be no classes. Reached at the couple's home, Jim Anderson told CNN that his wife has an attorney whom he would not identify. He described her as a good teacher. CNN's Alona Rivord, Aaron Cooper, Khadijah Rentas and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","Police report: Anderson, then 19, and her mother claimed brother's '86 death was accidental .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- As a deadline neared, Israel handed the United Nations Friday a report justifying its actions during last year's Gaza campaign and rebutting the so-called ""Goldstone Report"" as biased. At a tree-planting ceremony southern Israel Friday, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said, ""This report stresses that the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is like no other army, both from a moral standpoint as well as from a professional standpoint. ""The Goldstone Report is a distorted, false, and irresponsible report,"" Barak said. ""All of the soldiers and officers whom we sent to battle need to know that the state of Israel stands behind them even on the day after."" ""The Gaza Operation Investigations: An Update"" -- a follow-up of a July paper on the Gaza mission -- is in response to the United Nations' call for both the Jewish state and the Palestinian Hamas movement to conduct independent inquiries to examine charges that both sides committed war crimes during the course of the Gaza war fought just over a year ago. Israel's 46-page response outlines the steps the nation has taken to investigate charges of wrongdoing by its military during the course of its three-week offensive -- dubbed Operation Cast Lead -- in Gaza aimed at stopping militant rocket fire into Israel. Israel says it faced ""asymmetric conflicts"" and blamed ""militants operating from within and behind civilian areas"" for placing civilians at risk. The Israeli military has ""launched investigations into 150 separate incidents, including 36 criminal investigations opened thus far,"" according to the report. ""Israel is committed to ensuring that every such incident is fully and fairly investigated, to ensure that lessons can be learned and that, if justified, criminal or disciplinary proceedings initiated,"" the report stated. ""To this end the IDF policy requires that every allegation of wrongdoing be investigated, irrespective of its source."" The report does not mention whether Israel will conduct an independent, non-military investigation of the charges of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity leveled in the Goldstone Report. Released in September, the 575-page report written by a commission chaired by South African Judge Richard Goldstone alleged that both Hamas and Israel committed war crimes and may have also committed crimes against humanity during the course of fighting that killed some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. The majority of criticism in the report was reserved for Israel which has waged an aggressive international public relations campaign to discredit the probe's findings. With the publication of the report, the United Nations asked both Israel and Hamas to initiate independent investigations into the the various allegations and report back before February 5 when the General Assembly will be taking up the report and its recommendations. Among those recommendations were the call for the report's findings to be passed on to the International Criminal Court if both sides did not start legitimate investigations into war crimes. In Israel, the military has conducted investigations into possible wrong-doing itself which has raised criticism from human rights groups and some Israeli lawmakers that a more credible investigation is needed. Israel's outgoing attorney-general Menachem Mazuz told the Haaretz newspaper Friday ""Israel has a clear interest in conducting a serious, expert examination that will deal with the (Goldstone) report and produce an opposing report."" In Gaza, the ruling Hamas movement this week released a 20-page summary of the steps it has taken to investigate wrong-doing, contending it had prevented militants from rocketing Israeli civilians and that any examples to the contrary were a result of mistaken fire. It was a claim quickly dismissed by the by human rights organizations and the Israeli government. ""Hamas can spin the story and deny the evidence, but hundreds of rockets rained down on civilian areas in Israel where no military installations were located,"" Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch said in a statement. ""Hamas leaders at the time indicated they were intending to harm civilians.""","Israeli report justifies military actions in 2009 Gaza offensive .

"(CNN) -- A storm has barreled into the Southeast and sections of the Northeast, coating power lines and roads with ice and leaving thousands without power. More heavy snow was predicted for Mid-Atlantic cities, some of which already have record amounts, the National Weather Service said Saturday. Asheville, North Carolina, recorded 11 inches of snow on Friday. The weather service said less than a half-inch of snow should fall during the day, turning to freezing drizzle at night. There was an ice storm warning for the Carolinas until midnight. ""Ice accumulations of one-quarter to one-half inch are expected,"" forecasters said. ""Elevated surfaces such as trees, power lines and highway bridges and overpasses will accumulate ice most easily."" North Carolina's Department of Transportation asked motorists to avoid all unnecessary travel. The town of Cary, North Carolina, canceled its Winter Wonderland festival because of the storm. A foot of snow was expected in parts of Virginia, where iReporter William Bernstein, Jr. said people are ""just not used to this."" A typical snowstorm in Virginia Beach, located about 20 minutes from Norfolk, usually yields about 4 to 5 inches of snow, Bernstein said. But by 8 a.m., snowfall had well surpassed the norm. ""Nobody is really out on the roads,"" he said. ""They've closed off ramps and on ramps in downtown Norfolk."" See pictures from Virginia Beach on iReport.com . Washington and Baltimore, Maryland, were expected to get 4 to 6 inches of snow. Motorists were being warned to stay off the roadways, D.C. officials said. Forecasters warned that gusty winds in several states may topple ice laden trees and power lines. A Home Depot store in Spartanburg, South Carolina, saw a run on generators, fire logs and ice-melting chemicals Friday, and Spartanburg County called in extra dispatchers to handle emergency calls, CNN affiliate WYFF reported. Watch the snow pile up in Tennessee . Several inches of sleet covered the ground in the town of Travelers Rest, South Carolina, WYFF's Sean Muserallo reported. Brian Wood of Marietta, South Carolina, told WYFF his car was ""fish-tailing all the way"" as he drove to work at a restaurant Saturday morning. ""It's definitely not driving weather."" Tennessee's Transportation Department said highways statewide had patches of snow and ice, and trucks were spreading salt on roads across much of the eastern part of the state. How's the weather where you are? Send photos, video . The storm moved north and east Friday from the Southern Plains of Oklahoma and Texas. Oklahoma City was coated with ice and shivering with a daytime high of 20 degrees, said CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. In Dallas, Texas, it was 26 degrees. Oklahoma's Corporation Commission said Saturday that more than 108,000 homes and businesses were without power. Gov. Brad Henry had declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, ahead of the storm. President Obama signed a disaster declaration for Oklahoma on Saturday, authorizing federal aid to the hard-hit state. In northern Georgia on Saturday, about 1,200 customers were without power, down from 5,000 earlier in the day, the Electric Membership Cooperatives said in a written statement. They said the outages were caused by trees falling on power lines, and that power should be restored by late afternoon. School systems and communities in northeastern Georgia also canceled numerous weekend activities, CNN affiliate WNEG reported. Some are determined not to let the weather keep them indoors. iReporter Katy Hawkins of Norman, Oklahoma, said she and her roommate went outside to play in the snow after spending most of the day inside. ""Oklahoma does not usually get enough snow to make a snowball, but yesterday we had at least 7 inches in the Norman area,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Haiti's orphanages have become targets for people desperate for food, water and medical supplies in the aftermath of the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake. On Wednesday night, Maison de Lumiere, an orphanage caring for 50 orphans, came under attack from a group of 20 armed men, aid workers told the Joint Council on International Children's Services. A neighboring orphanage sheltering about 135 children has been robbed several times over the past few days, they said. Meanwhile, aid workers said a third orphanage caring for 17 orphans reported that townspeople are trespassing and tapping into the water supply that is reserved for the children. ""It was calm at first, but the situation is getting more desperate,"" said David Beck, pastor at Child Hope International, the nonprofit that oversees Maison de Lumiere. No shots were fired in the attack on the orphanage, and security guards were able to drive off the marauders, he said. But one orphanage worker was hit in the head with a rock, he said. ""If people think you have food, then they will come after it,"" Beck said. The orphanage is rationing what food and water it does have, he said. Haiti is the poorest nation in the Western hemisphere, and experienced high rates of poverty and disease even before the quake. The quake has made the situation far more desperate. Looting is becoming a big concern for the orphanages as fear and frustration mount and help is slow to arrive, said Tom DiFilipo of the Joint Council on International Children's Services, a U.S.-based advocacy group for children in need of families. To protect the children, some orphanages are on lock-down, according to volunteers working with the relief agencies. ""When bringing in supplies to an orphanage, you can only bring in a day or two day's worth,"" said DiFilipo. ""If you bring more than that, the locals come in."" This week's raids are included on a growing list of difficulties facing orphanages that is being compiled by the Joint Council on International Children's Services. DiFilipo said he expects the challenges of food, medical aid and security to continue affecting the orphanages for weeks. For every Haitian orphan brought to safety in the United States and elsewhere, thousands more are left behind to face the primitive conditions resulting from last week's earthquake. There is no accurate count of how many orphanages have experienced looting and other attacks. Since the quake, the Joint Council on International Children's Services has received dozens of phone calls, text messages and e-mails from orphanages reporting problems ranging from food shortages to security threats. The agency is in touch with about 50 orphanages in Haiti and the reports are updated daily. The group is also working with members of Congress, the Red Cross and other aid agencies to relay the messages. Before the quake, Haiti had 380,000 orphans, according to UNICEF. It is still too early to determine how many children were orphaned by the quake. The people of Haiti have grown desperate for food, water and assistance since the quake decimated the capital last week, toppling buildings, cutting power, contaminating water supplies and ravaging roads. The conditions for children in Haiti are bleak, aid officials said. Orphans are sleeping outside or in makeshift tents. Facilities are running low on food, water and medical supplies. Some orphanages have already reported deaths. Ruuska Village, an orphanage in the Bon Repos section of Port-au-Prince, was looted several times during the first few days after the quake, said volunteer Cherie Shropshire. Security was inadequate after 80 percent of the building was damaged, she said. The locks were broken and people stole food, clothes and supplies, but the orphanage was able to keep its generator protected, Shropshire said. ""Another aftershock that woke us so roughly on Wednesday morning and a wall tumbling down on our heads, children starving, the orphanage being looted as the frustration continues to grow regarding the delay in distributing supplies, children dying from sickness. ...,"" wrote an American adoption service provider in Haiti in a blog run by the Joint Council on International Children's Services. Reporting crimes to police is nearly impossible for officials at the damaged orphanages. Many Haitian police officers were injured or killed in the earthquake. Help from private security officers also is hindered by unreliable communication and poor transportation. Security needs to be made a higher priority, said Daniel Kaniewski, deputy director of George Washington University's Homeland Security Policy Institute. On Tuesday, the United Nations Security Council approved a proposal to send an additional 2,000 soldiers and 1,500 police officers to Haiti. ""Providing security resources is as equally important as providing all of the other kinds of aid in the country,"" Kaniewski said. ""Without security, you won't be able to effectively distribute to the most needed areas in Haiti."" At Maison de Lumiere, where looters raided on Wednesday night, Beck sees both sides of the story. ""On one hand, the people around the orphanage have been incredibly gracious and mutually supportive since the earthquake,"" he said. ""On the other hand, last night's attack reminds us that there are a few aggressive people whose growing desperation can drive them to attempt to take others' food and water by force.""","20 men attacked Maison de Lumiere, an orphanage in Port-au-Prince, aid workers say .

"London, England (CNN) -- Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair says he would have taken the decision to remove Saddam Hussein even without evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. In an excerpt from a BBC interview to be aired Sunday, Blair said: ""I would still have thought it right to remove him. I mean obviously you would have had to use and deploy different arguments, about the nature of the threat."" Blair, who left office in 2007 and now serves as a special envoy to the Middle East, will be questioned next year at an inquiry into Britain's role in the 2003 conflict. At the time of the conflict the British government based its decision to go to war on evidence, contained within a dossier it published in September 2002, that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) ready to deploy within 45 minutes. But critics of the war claim the Bush administration had decided to remove the Iraqi dictator by force by the end of 2002 and that Blair was aware of this and had offered his support. The current inquiry is not a court of law, so it cannot find anyone criminally responsible or even apportion blame. But inquiry members will be able to judge the legality of the conflict. Despite doubts about Iraq's WMDs, Blair was defiant about the need for regime change in Baghdad for the sake of peace in the region. He told the BBC: ""I can't really think we'd be better with him and his two sons still in charge, but it's incredibly difficult and I totally understand. ""That's why I sympathize with the people who were against [the war] for perfectly good reasons and are against it now, but for me, you know, in the end I had to take the decision. ""It was the notion of him as a threat to the region, of which the development of WMD was obviously one. He used chemical weapons on his own people, so this was obviously the thing that was uppermost in my mind."" Last month, Blair denied a claims that Peter Goldsmith, Britain's Attorney General at the time of the Iraq war, was ""bullied"" into declaring that the invasion was legal. According to reports in the British media, Goldsmith warned Blair the invasion was a serious breach of international law in an ""uncompromising letter"" in July 2002, eight months before the campaign. In an interview with CNN, the former premier refuted the claim but accepted his reputation had been called into question many times over Iraq. ""Over the years I've answered questions time and time again about it [the invasion] and am happy to do so again,"" he said. ""It was an important decision, and it was a momentous decision in terms of your country and in terms of mine. ""But one of the things you learn as leader of a country is that you have the responsibility to take decisions. Some of those decisions are difficult decisions and some are very controversial... sometimes they can be very bitter, very difficult. That's part of being a leader."" Britain has already held four hearings about the Iraq war. But because all were held before the end of 2004 -- so close to the start of the war -- they were hampered by limited information, political analyst Glen Rangwala of Cambridge University told CNN. ""They didn't manage to achieve anything like a comprehensive understanding of the paths that led the UK to support the United States in the invasion,"" he said. ""This will be the first to look at political decision-making that led to the British invasion of 2003, with the potential to tell a full story."" Britain's first two inquiries were held by government committees in 2003. The House of Commons Select Committee on Foreign Affairs examined whether Britain's Foreign Office gave accurate and complete information to Parliament in the run-up to the war. It found the government exerted no improper influence on the drafting of the dossier given to Parliament on Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction. The Intelligence and Security Committee then examined whether intelligence about Iraq and its weapons was properly assessed and accurately reflected in government publications. Its findings were mixed. The next two inquiries had narrow mandates, looking at specific aspects of the war. The Hutton report from January 2004 investigated the death of David Kelly, a leading microbiologist and former U.N. weapons inspector who committed suicide months earlier. Kelly had worked for the British Ministry of Defence, advising it on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, but was later found to be the source of a BBC report that said the government had exaggerated evidence to justify war on Iraq. Following that came the Butler inquiry, which looked at the accuracy of intelligence on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and elsewhere. It found some of the intelligence sources were ""seriously flawed,"" but that there was no evidence of deliberate distortion or culpable negligence by spy agencies.","Former British PM Tony Blair tells BBC it was right to remove Saddam Hussein, sons from Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Thirty to 40 ships -- including several passenger ships -- were stuck Thursday in ice off the coast of Sweden, said a spokesman for the Maritime Search and Rescue Center in Gothenburg, Sweden. The area of the Baltic Sea worst hit by the ice were the waters bounded by mainland Sweden, the Stockholm archipelago and the Finnish island of Aland, said Tommy Gardebring, press officer with the Swedish Maritime Administration. The center identified one of the passenger ships as the Amorella, with 753 passengers and 190 crew members. Several passenger vessels from Viking Line were stuck, he said. One of them had been freed. ""It has been a lot colder than normal in the southern parts of the Baltic sea, but in the north all is normal with normal levels of ice,"" Gardebring said. ""However, in the worst-affected areas, the ice breakers that normally operate haven't been able to cope with the ice, which is why we are sending additional ice breakers."" The extra help was expected to arrive around midnight (6 p.m. ET), he said. ""There was never any danger for the safety of the vessels, but we have increased our preparedness, just in case, since the ice puts a lot of pressure on the sides of the ships,"" Gardebring said. He predicted that most of the ships would be freed by Friday.

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Kashi Shodeinde turned the ignition and his battered truck convulsed as black fumes poured from the exhaust. His precious cargo of bottled Guinness beer rattled as he set off into the gauntlet of Lagos' potholed roads and traffic. Nigeria consumes more Guinness beer than Ireland, the company says. Working for a foreign company to send his three children to school, Shodeinde is on the frontline of private investors' struggle to gain a foothold in Nigeria. ""In the whole of Nigeria, Guinness is No. 1!"" he exclaimed. Brewed in Nigeria since 1962, the country's thicker-tasting ""Foreign Extra"" is not just supporting Shodeinde and his family, but helped Guinness Nigeria defy the global recession with 6 percent annual growth this year, according to the company. Nigeria now drinks more Guinness than Ireland -- making it the second-biggest consumer in the world, after Britain, according to Guinness Nigeria. A success story like Guinness in Nigeria highlights the potential for trade and foreign investment in Africa that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke about last week when she addressed an African trade convention in Kenya. ""Africa is capable, and is making economic progress. In fact, one doesn't have to look far to see that Africa is ripe with opportunities, some already realized, and others waiting to be seized together if we determine to do so,"" Clinton said. She is on a tour of Africa to promote development and good governance, and to underscore the Obama administration's commitment to Africa. Nigeria is one of several countries on her itinerary. But many challenges keep foreign businesses from coming to Nigeria. Regarded as a frontier market, Nigeria is ranked 118 out of 187 in the World Bank's ""Doing Business"" rankings. Failing infrastructure, irregular electricity and erratic government policies have caused foreign investors to shy from Nigeria's relatively untapped market of 150 million people. ""Nigeria remains an information dark spot and therefore does itself no advantage in terms of trying to attract foreign investment,"" said Doyin Salami, an economist at Lagos Business School. The Dunlop and Michelin tire companies have in recent years closed their factories in Nigeria, because of the rising cost of production. Yet, Nigeria Guinness is expanding its facilities to increase production. ""Business is really growing,"" said Afebuameh Cephas, the plant manager for Guinness' Benin factory, saying production was up almost 30 percent in a year. All the ingredients are produced locally -- except for Guinness extract, a secret ingredient added to Guinness brewed anywhere in the world. But there's no secret to Guinness' Nigeria success, said Chairman Tunde Savage. ""The most important thing here is you have to be very transparent in what you do. Your governing principle must be very clear here. You must ensure you do things correctly and rightly."" Fortunately for competitors, Guinness is not to everyone's taste. Bottles of all shapes and flavors rattled on a bar table in Lagos one recent night as a band struck a deep bass note in the humidity of the night. ""It's too harsh! It's too harsh!"" one regular exclaimed. ""It tastes good for an African man!"" argued another.","Guinness beer plant in Nigeria expanding facilities as business thrives .

"Washington (CNN) -- Flights transporting critically injured Haitians into the United States will resume within a few hours, the White House announced Sunday afternoon. The flights were temporarily suspended because of logistical issues including space to care for the injured, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Saturday. ""Having received assurances that additional capacity exists both here and among our international partners, we determined that we can resume these critical flights,"" he said in a statement Sunday. Full coverage . The statement, released Sunday afternoon, said flights would resume ""in the next 12 hours."" The evacuated patients are those whose medical needs could not be met by doctors working in Haiti. Nearly 23,000 people have been seen by U.S. personnel since the January 12 earthquake, Vietor said. Some volunteer American doctors in Haiti expect the flights to resume at 11 a.m. Monday, according to Nery Ynclan, a spokeswoman for Dr. Barth Green, of the University of Miami, who is leading a team of volunteers in Port-au-Prince. Airlifts stopped after there were ""concerns about the strain on domestic health capacity,"" Vietor said. But officials have increased the ability to care for patients through a network of nonprofits and U.S. hospitals, he said. But earlier reports also cited questions over who would pay for patients' care. The missing, the found, the victims . The flights stopped Wednesday when some states refused to allow entry to Haitians needing care, according to Navy Capt. Kevin Aandahl, a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Command. He would not say which states objected. In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius obtained by CNN, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist asked that the federal government activate the National Disaster Medical System to provide reimbursement to Florida and other states for taking in the patients, who have no insurance. Florida's health facilities were already strained by winter tourism and seasonal residence migration, Crist said in the letter. But Florida officials said Saturday that the state was committed to assisting Haitian quake victims and had not asked the airlifts be halted. Florida will play a role in caregiving once flights resume. The state has identified medical facilities that could take in victims, Vietor said in Sunday's statement. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report.","White House spokesman: Flights had been temporarily suspended because of logistical issues .

"New York (CNN) -- Criminal charges will not be filed against the owner of a chimpanzee that mauled and blinded a Connecticut woman earlier this year, according to Connecticut State's Attorney David Cohen. At a news conference Monday, Cohen explained that criminal prosecution against Sandra Herold, 77, was not warranted because she was not aware of the risk her pet posed. On February 16, Herold had called her friend Charla Nash, 55, for help in getting her pet chimpanzee Travis back inside her house after he used a key to escape. When Nash arrived at the Stamford home of her friend, the chimp, who had been featured in TV commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy, jumped on her and began biting and mauling her, causing serious injuries to her face, neck and hands. Police shot Travis to halt the attack and he later died of gunshot wounds. Cohen explained that the dangers of keeping a pet chimpanzee were never fully explained to Herold by the Connecticut State Department of Environmental Protection. While the agency was aware that the chimpanzee was living with Herold, there is no evidence that they ever reached out to her to detail why the primate posed a threat to her and others in the community. Furthermore, Herold had never had any problems with Travis in the past. Although Travis had escaped once before in 2003 and ""wreaked havoc"" on the streets of Stamford for a couple of hours, the chimp had never exhibited any violent behavior, especially towards Nash, with whom he had interacted with regularly. Nash, Cohen stated, had specifically been called that day because Herold thought she could help in controlling the escaped chimpanzee. In the state of Connecticut, criminal prosecution would have to determine that Herold acted recklessly, disregarding the risk that Travis would attack and cause serious injuries to another person. Because of the chimp's familiarity with Nash, his previously placid behavior and the lack of contact by the Department of Environmental Protection, Cohen determined that Herold would not be held criminally responsible for the attack. ""This does not in any way minimize the horror that we all feel with what occurred and with the horrendous injuries suffered,"" he said. ""Our prayers go out to the family and to the victim."" In March, shortly after the attack, the family of Charla Nash filed a lawsuit seeking $50 million in damages from the owner of the primate. The court papers, filed in Stamford Superior Court in Connecticut, alleged that the owner was liable for the attack, negligent and reckless in her ownership of a wild animal. Following the attack, Nash was transported to the famed Cleveland Clinic, where the nation's first face transplant was performed. In a written statement the Cleveland Clinic said that Nash had lost her nose, upper and lower lips, eyelids and both her hands in the attack, as well as the ""bony structures in her mid-face."" The attack has raised questions about whether exotic animals should be kept as pets. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has stated that primates and crocodiles should be added to a state list of animals citizens are not allowed to own. When asked if there was anything to be learned from the attack, Cohen said, ""I think the public will have to draw their own lessons from what was a very tragic incident.""","Chimpanzee mauled and blinded a Connecticut woman earlier this year .

"Editor's note: Roland S. Martin, a CNN political analyst, is a nationally syndicated columnist and author of ""Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith,"" and the forthcoming book, ""The First: President Barack Obama's Road to the White House."" He is a commentator for TV One Cable Network and host of a one-hour Sunday morning news show. As a columnist, I'm used to writing things that offend other folks. It comes with the job. And there are times when I have responded to what other folks in the media will say and write. Again, it's just what we do. There have been a number of things I've read and heard over the past few months, but one that has totally ticked me off is the recent column by ESPN's Rick Reilly in the March 22 issue of ESPN The Magazine. Reilly uses his column to personally attack Greg Wise, the boys head basketball coach at Jack Yates High School in Houston, Texas. In the despicable piece, Reilly tries to link Wise with a fight in the parking lot after Yates destroyed archrival Booker T. Washington. Apparently shots were fired, and in Reilly's world, it's all tied to Yates beating them 132-68. So I wonder if Reilly blames Gary Williams for Maryland upsetting No. 4 ranked Duke, this leading to fans going bonkers -- some say riot -- and 28 people getting arrested. I've seen folks fight after one-point losses; that's just what happens when dumb folks talk trash in the parking lot. They either duke it out with fists, or these days, pull out a gun to make their point. Reilly then has the gall to say that the school district in Houston needs to intervene to ""stop"" Wise, even suggesting that Yates Principal Ronald Mumphery should ""grow a pair."" So what do you propose Rick? Tell him not to blow other teams out? So the next time we see a 59-0 or 77-0 score in football, are we to scold the coach and tell him he will be suspended if his teams keeps scoring points? Should Bob Stoops have been put on administrative leave when his Sooners destroyed my Aggies 77-0? In fact, last year Oklahoma beat my Aggies 65-10. Hey, Rick, wasn't 45, 50, 60 or even 70 enough for Stoops? Why 77 points? The Reillys of the world will remark that, ""Oh, these are poor high school students. Their self-esteem will be hurt by this."" Bullcrap, Rick. Yes, Yates has blown teams out by 50, 60 and even 100 points. When you're good, it happens. Let me be clear: I'm not objective on this issue. I graduated from Yates in 1987, where I attended the Magnet School of Communications. I watched Yates in 1985 win the football state championship by going undefeated and blowing out teams every week. That team set a state record for most points and set about another 20 records. They were just as dominating in football as this year's basketball team. What wimps like Reilly object to is Wise teaching his team to press, press and press. Yates used this strategy to win the Class 4A state championship last year, and this weekend will try to win another title. They play all 15 guys and rotate them in and out. They wear the opposing team out, forcing them to commit turnover after turnover. On the side of their championship rings is the slogan, ""32 minutes of hell."" It's similar to what Nolan Richardson's Arkansas teams were nicknamed, ""40 minutes of hell.' Guys like Reilly love to jump on the poor souls campaign. But I learned a long time ago that when you put on your uniform and lace 'em up, you stand a chance of getting your butt kicked. That's all a part of the game. What guys like Reilly also don't understand is that their words matter. And by writing such a horrible piece about Wise, he is creating an impression in folks' mind nationally about Wise, and that can hurt him down the road. Right now I'm reading Rus Bradburd's book, ""Forty Minutes of Hell: The Extraordinary Life of Nolan Richardson."" It tells the story of the famed Arkansas coach and the battles he had to fight to reach the top of the college basketball world. Bradburd tells the story of a number of black basketball coaches who never got a shot at the major jobs because of their race. He writes about how coaches like Richardson were denigrated for the frantic style of play, and assumed it was all about talent and not about coaching. But he also told an interesting story of how so many talented coaches at historically black colleges never got a shot at major Division 1-A coaching jobs because of their won-loss record. They were forced to take guaranteed money games against more talented teams, so when it was time for the NCAA tournament, the teams had poor records, and that didn't reflect well on the coach. Bottom line: The record of the coach played a role in getting their next job. And sportswriters, as Bradburd writes, tend to shape the views of the public based on what they write, and that can be damaging to anyone's career. Folks, for any college looking to revive their basketball team -- Richardson took a dormant Tulsa team and won the NIT title and led them to the NCAA -- Greg Wise would be a great hire. His team finished 34-1 last year, and this year they are 32-0, and with two games left, can claim back-to-back titles. Are you telling me that a coach who is 66-1 in two years should be, as Reilly wrote, ""dipped in seal butter and dropped into a polar bear's cage?"" No! He should be celebrated for being successful. The game is about winning, right? Not only that, Yates has a great group of kids (I've met most of them). They study, are polite, don't get into trouble and are all-around good kids. At the end of the day, they are damn good and folks like Reilly just don't like it. By the way: Reilly, who ESPN pays a ton of dough, wrote this about Wise: ""He tried to break the record for most 100-point games in a row (and failed)."" Rick, you are dead wrong. This past weekend, Yates scored 100 points for the 14th consecutive game, tying the national record set by Hobbs of New Mexico team in 1969-70. (On Thursday night, they scored 106 points to set the new national record.) A simple fact check would have discovered that. It's no surprise Reilly was entirely wrong about Yates' Greg Wise. He could not even get this basic fact right. Rick, use some of that fat ESPN money, stop reading what others write about Yates, and take a simple trip down to Houston to see this mighty Jack Yates team in person. You might learn a thing or two about a team that is full of class and the pride of Third Ward. I'm proud of these young men, and even more proud of their coach, who is a role model to them. Isn't that what we want our coaches to be? The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin's old high school has nation's best basketball team .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republican Scott Brown was sworn in Thursday as the new U.S. senator from Massachusetts to fill the seat formerly held by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, and immediately signaled opposition to President Obama's spending plans. Brown's new Senate colleagues applauded after the ceremony on the floor of the Senate chamber conducted by Vice President Joe Biden, in his capacity as president of the Senate. Democratic Sen. John Kerry, also of Massachusetts, and Brown's wife, Gail Huff, accompanied Brown into the chamber. At a news conference after the ceremony, Brown thanked Massachusetts voters who gave him a surprise victory in the January 19 special election in a state that had not elected a Republican senator since 1972. ""I can't promise I'll be right in every vote I make. I'm sure I'll make mistakes from time to time,"" Brown said. ""But I will try to learn and grow and do the very best job I can on a day-to-day basis."" Brown's election victory stripped Senate Democrats of their 60-seat Senate supermajority, imperiling the ability of Obama and Democrats to push major legislative priorities such as health care reform through Congress. The Republican upset in Massachusetts also raised fears among many congressional Democrats of a potential GOP landslide in November's midterm elections. A fiscal conservative who holds some moderate views, Brown was noncommittal on whether he would support a Republican filibuster in coming Senate consideration of some Obama nominees for government posts. He also said he needed to talk to generals in the field before deciding to support Obama's call, supported by top military leaders, to repeal the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy regarding a ban on gays in the military. Brown made clear he opposes the spending policies of the Obama administration, stating that the $862 billion stimulus bill passed last year ""didn't create one new job"" in Massachusetts or across the country. He also said Congress should start over on health care with bipartisan talks, instead of continuing work on separate comprehensive bills passed by the House and Senate. That prompted a response later from Jay Carney, spokesman for Biden, who said, ""Anyone can go to recovery.gov (on the Internet) and see that Massachusetts state and local government, businesses and community organizations have already reported directly funding over 9,000 jobs in the state last year -- and that's based on a only a portion of the total $8.4 billion in (stimulus) funds that have already gone to Massachusetts."" He also said Congress should start over on health care with bipartisan talks, instead of continuing work on separate comprehensive bills passed by the House and Senate. At the same time, Brown said he would consider each piece of legislation on merit, rather than whether it was proposed by one party or another. ""If I see a bill that's good for my state first, I don't care where it comes from,"" Brown said. ""If it's good for Massachusetts, I'll consider it."" Thursday's ceremony occurred a week earlier than originally planned. Massachusetts officials had said it would take a few weeks after the election to certify the result of Brown's victory. In a letter to Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Secretary of State William Galvin on Wednesday, Brown's attorney said the senator-elect had planned on being sworn in on February 11, but had been told that several Senate votes would be held before then. ""For this reason, he wants certification to occur immediately,"" attorney Daniel Winslow wrote. The certification occurred Thursday, allowing Brown to officially fill his seat later in the day. ""There's no hidden agenda,"" Brown said of his push to get certified this week instead of next. ""It's because I want to get to work."" Asked why his daughters didn't attend the swearing-in, Brown explained one of them, Ayla, had a college basketball game to play Thursday and the other, Arianna, had a college exam. ""The Bibles I used for today's swearing-in belong to my daughters, and I stacked them one on top of the other and took my oath on them,"" Brown said. Brown will be taking over Kennedy's coveted office space in the Senate Russell building. Sen. Paul Kirk, who was appointed to fill the seat after Kennedy's death, currently occupies the office and will move out. Several Senate sources tell CNN that the Senate Rules Committee, which assigns office space, decided to give Brown the office space as a matter of convenience. Because of his seniority, Kennedy had one of the most coveted office suites in the Senate complex. It is located in the Russell building, down the hall from the Rotunda, and has balconies that overlook the Capitol.

"Driftwood, Texas (CNN) -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry won his state's Republican gubernatorial primary outright on Tuesday, avoiding a potentially costly runoff election against Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. Hutchison called Perry to concede the race after returns indicated that the governor was cruising toward a resounding victory in the closely-watched primary. ""Now we must unite,"" she said. ""We must win Texas for Republicans."" Perry's win ended a yearlong intra-party fight that was billed from the start as a clash of Texas political titans but ended with a whimper as Hutchison struggled to fight a tide of anti-Washington sentiment among conservatives. The governor cast his victory as a warning shot to Washington in the mold of recent GOP wins in the Virginia and New Jersey governor's races and the Massachusetts special Senate election. ""I think the message is pretty clear,"" Perry told supporters at his election night party near Austin. ""Conservatism has never been stronger than it is today."" Perry said the message to Washington was simple: ""Quit spending all the money,"" he said. ""Stop trying to take over our lives and our businesses."" He added: ""Stop messing with Texas!"" Perry, the longest serving governor in Texas history, is seeking a third full term in Austin. His opponent in the general election will be Democrat Bill White, the former Houston mayor who dispatched six opponents in the Democratic primary. With nearly two-thirds of precincts reporting, Perry maintained a 20-point lead over Hutchison and appeared to be on pace to cross the crucial 50 percent mark needed to avoid a six-week runoff election against the three-term senator, who began her gubernatorial bid as the prohibitive frontrunner but stumbled as Perry's campaign cast her as a big-spending Washington insider. GOP activist Debra Medina, a conservative with strong support among Tea Party activists, looked to be headed for a third place finish. White, the popular former three-term mayor of Houston, the country's fourth-largest city, predicted that Perry will try to nationalize the race and tie him to unpopular Democratic agenda items in Washington. ""He'll run against President Obama,"" White said in an interview. ""That's probably for his own political career. I think he wants to run for president. I'm just running for the people of Texas. It shouldn't be about a party or who's doing what to whom in Washington.""","Incumbent Rick Perry defeats Kay Bailey Hutchinson in Texas gubernatorial GOP primary .

"(CNN)  -- Ohio has executed its second inmate using a new one-drug method, officials said Thursday. Vernon Smith, 37, was pronounced dead at 10:28 a.m., according to a statement from the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. Smith was convicted of killing Toledo, Ohio, store owner Sohail Darwish during a robbery in 1993. According to court documents, Darwish did not resist Smith's orders to open the cash register and hand over his wallet, but Smith shot him anyway, saying he ""moved too slow."" Darwish bled to death from a single gunshot wound to the chest, the documents said. Darwish, a 28-year-old from Saudi Arabia, had a year-old daughter, and his wife was pregnant with another daughter, the Columbus Dispatch newspaper reported Thursday. The execution was Ohio's second using the one-drug method. Kenneth Biros, 51, was put to death in December. It was Ohio's first execution since September, when Gov. Ted Strickland and federal courts halted capital punishment in the state after a botched attempt to execute another prisoner, Romell Broom. The prison staff could not find a suitable vein for Broom's lethal injections. The one-drug method used on Biros had never been tried on U.S. death row inmates. It relies on a single dose of sodium thiopental injected into a vein. A separate two-drug muscle injection was available as a backup, officials said. The one-drug method has been used to euthanize animals. The same drug, sodium thiopental -- but at a much lower dosage -- is the first ingredient in the three-drug method previously used in Ohio, as well as in all but one of the other 34 states with the death penalty. CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","Vernon Smith, 37, put to death with large dose of sodium thiopental .

"Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN) -- With a wink of its eye, Canada brought to close the Winter Olympics by making fun of one the glitches that plagued the first week of the games. As the closing ceremonies began, a mime with a tool belt came out to the caldron, where one of the legs was still in the floor of BC Place, having failed to rise during the opening ceremonies 17 days ago. The mime found the power cords weren't connected, but when he plugged it in, sparks flew from the power supply. The mime found a rope and pretended to pull the fourth leg up into place as the crowd roared its approval. It was with a smile that Canada wrapped up the games, having won the most gold medals any nation has won in any Winter Olympics and having won back the hockey gold medal it feels should permanently reside here. It was a 180-degree reversal from the way the games began when critics complained about the warm, rainy weather, observers criticized the safety of the track after the death of a luger in a training run and Canadians wondered what was going on with the caldron and their athletes, for whom officials from the host nation had predicted overwhelming success. As the opening ceremonies came to a close, speed skating legend Catriona LeMay Doan was left there, with her torch, wondering what to do. And Canadians asked themselves: What next? LeMay Doan got her chance to light the caldron after all. As the mime raised the stubborn leg during the closing ceremonies, LeMay Doan came out beaming with her torch. She wasn't the only Canadian beaming Sunday. Despite a slow first week on the tracks, rinks and courses of the games, the home team became a story of resiliency and national pride. Joannie Rochette, who lost her beloved mother to a heart attack two days before she was to compete in the first night of figure skating, was chosen as the Canadian flag bearer for the closing ceremonies. The 24-year-old skater will long be remembered as the symbol of these games for her strength in a time of personal crisis. Rochette skated flawlessly in that first night of the competition, then dazzled the crowd in the free skate, winning the bronze medal, the hearts of a nation and the respect of those watching around the world. Years from now, they will talk of her strength and her bravery, but she just saw herself as the daughter who shared a dream with a mother who wouldn't let her fail. She wasn't perfect in her performance, but in an imperfect games, she was a beacon of all that is right about sports. The head of the host organization said his nation was proud of the way it had revealed itself to each other and to the world. ""I believe we Canadians tonight are stronger, more united, more in love with our country and more connected with each other than ever before,"" John Furlong, chief executive officer of VANOC, said. ""These Olympic Games have lifted us up. If the Canada that came together on opening night was a little mysterious, it no longer is. Now you know us, eh?"" Watch Canadian fans celebrate in the streets . The rest of the closing ceremony became a lighthearted tribute to Canada, featuring comedians and some of its most famous singers, like Neil Young, Michael Buble and Alanis Morissette. These Olympics needed saving. Even as thousands of fans and reporters were arriving the first week, it almost seemed as if the games were a national embarrassment. The problems actually started a month before the Olympics opened, as Vancouver went through the warmest January in history. The well-above-freezing temperatures caused some observers to call these the Spring Olympics. Vancouver Organizing Committee officials said that while it wasn't the weather they expected when they won the bid for the games in 2003, it really wouldn't prevent the outdoor events from taking place. During those first rough days, Canadian officials tried to reassure the nation and the world that the host country would do well on medals, and that they had planned for weather pitfalls. With the Winter Games closing Sunday night, you could almost hear the voices of Canadian officials saying, ""We told you everything would work out."" It was on the slopes of Whistler Creekside where two of the most compelling stories of these Winter Olympics unfolded. One belonged to Lindsey Vonn, the U.S. skier who had dominated the World Cup. She was a medal favorite in four of the five Olympic events she entered, but on the eve of the games, she suffered a major shin injury. The weather delays gave her more time to heal. She won two medals, a gold in the downhill and a bronze in the Super G, but crashed in her other three events. On the other end of the spectrum was former bad boy Bode Miller, who made more news partying at the 2006 Olympics than he did on the slopes. But 2010 will be remembered for how he redeemed himself by skiing to three medals, including a gold in the super combined. He became the most decorated U.S. Alpine skier in history. Speed skater Apolo Anton Ohno also wrote himself into the U.S. medals record book with a silver in the 1,500 meters short track final, a bronze in the 1,000 meters and a bronze in the relay. With eight medals, he has won more medals than any other U.S. Winter Olympian in history. Other athletes who impressed: . • Marit Bjoergen of Norway was the leading medal winner of the games, taking home five medals in cross-country skiing --- three gold, one silver and one bronze. • Short track speed skater Wang Meng of China, who won three golds (1,000 meters, 1,500, relay). • Norway's Ole Einar Bjoerndalen, who won his sixth career Winter Olympics gold, in the 4x7.5km cross-country skiing relay. • Germany's Magdalena Neuner, who won two individual gold medals in biathlon, and then gave up her spot in the relay so a teammate would have a chance to medal; . • Slovenia's Petra Majdic, who won bronze in the women's sprint cross-country skiing race, despite racing through the heats with four broken ribs suffered in a training run. Medalists share Olympic memories . The medals podium belonged to the United States, despite the ""Own The Podium"" program -- with its millions of dollars poured in by the Canadian government -- that the folks from the host nation bragged would make them the top team at the games. In the end, while they owned the top step, their neighbors borrowed the podium for 17 days. The U.S. won a record 37 medals. The total included golds by the four-man bobsled team led by driver Steven Holcomb, the first gold medal ever by a skier in Nordic Combined (Bill Demong), and the expected brilliance of Shaun White in the snowboard halfpipe. Despite a slow start and some disappointments in events that were supposed to be almost sure things, the Canadians won a record number of gold medals. That number included men's hockey, beating the United States 3-2 in overtime -- a dream result for the host nation. The games had started in the most awful, sobering way possible, with the news of the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili. His fatal training accident called into question he safety of the track and spotlighted the fact that Canadian athletes had had far more training time on the tracks, slopes and facilities of these games. Members of the British press blamed Kumaritashvili's death on the organizers' ""lust for glory."" The criticism stung, but Canadian officials and fans were resilient. If you don't know the words to ""O Canada,"" you have not been in Vancouver these past two weeks. It was being sung everywhere, in bars, on the streets, in arenas, even during low points such as Canada's loss to the United States by 5-3 in the men's hockey preliminary rounds. And whoever makes Maple Leaf flags probably has already made a year or two's worth of profit.","Winter Olympics end Sunday with Canada claiming most gold, U.S. most total medals .

"(CNN) -- The living quarters of a fire station in Maryland exploded and burned Thursday after its snow-laden roof collapsed in the wake of the pair of record-setting snowstorms that howled through the mid-Atlantic region in the past week, state police said. Crushed roofs were not uncommon in the region -- authorities in the District of Columbia reported 22 such incidents as a result of the heavy snowfall -- but the collapse at the Sykesville Freedom District Fire Department stood out because it punctured a natural gas line, igniting the blaze, officials said. Firefighters were out on a call when the roof fell about 7:40 a.m., Carroll County spokeswoman Vivian Laxton told CNN affiliate WBAL-TV. No injuries were reported. In the aftermath of what some are calling ""snowmageddon,"" thousands of people were without power and transportation departments were still trying to clean snowy, icy streets Thursday. In Washington, more than 250,000 federal workers were told to stay home from work for a fourth day, and public schools were closed. But in New York, children went back to school after a three-day ""holiday."" After a storm that dumped more than 30 inches of snow in some places last weekend, the latest part of the one-two punch dropped 22.5 inches on Baltimore, Maryland, 15.8 inches on Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and about 10 inches on Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, Central Park in New York and Atlantic City, New Jersey, the National Weather Service said. Records for total snowfall for the season have been set at Dulles International Airport west of Washington, with 72 inches; Philadelphia, with 70.3; Baltimore, with 70.1; Reagan Washington National Airport, with 55.6; and Atlantic City, with 48.7, according to the weather service. The snow brought down tree limbs that in turn pulled down power lines. Ricky Watkins of Petersburg, in central Virginia, sent in a CNN iReport of a transformer near his home that erupted in sparks and flames after a tree downed power lines there Wednesday morning. Although he said he was ""used to the snow"" after working in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Chicago, Illinois, he said he had never seen a display like the one the transformer put on. ""I was not about to get any closer,"" he said. ""It appeared that a transformer had fallen into a nearby tree and was about to catch it and the house on fire."" He said his power went out about 8 a.m. Wednesday but was back on by about 2:15 that afternoon. Dominion Virginia Power reported only 3,400 outages by Thursday afternoon, most of them in southeast Virginia, but it was unclear whether all of those were storm-related, said utility spokeswoman La-Ha Anderson. ""We hope to have anybody affected by the storm yesterday to be back on today,"" she said. Dominion serves 2.4 million customers from the Washington metropolitan area to northern North Carolina. Potomac Electric Power Co., which serves Washington and Maryland, had 1,900 customers without power, PEPCO spokesman Bob Hainey said Thursday morning. The utility hopes to get everybody's service restored by Friday, he said. ""We're cautiously optimistic,"" he said. ""Our goal is to get everyone back on as soon as possible."" Dulles International Airport and Reagan National Airport reopened Thursday after closing to flights Wednesday afternoon. Amtrak was still providing limited service for Washington, New York and Boston, Massachusetts, on Thursday, but most passenger rail service south of Washington was canceled. Amtrak said the weather had downed trees and power lines on portions of freight railroad tracks south of Washington, ""requiring continued service cancellations in Virginia, and the Carolinas."" Seth Bishop, 18, a freshman at George Washington University, where classes were canceled, said he was unfazed by the snow. ""I'm originally from New Hampshire, so I'm used to snow,"" he told CNN's iReport. He said he had a good time touring the outside of snow-covered monuments on the National Mall and viewing sites in the northwest business district. ""It's pretty eerie, actually, because no one was around."" Bishop said he also was busy with other pursuits. ""I've been going through a bunch of snowball fights [and] getting some extra work done for classes."" As the mid-Atlantic region was digging out Thursday, another snowstorm was hitting Texas. Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport had recorded more than 6 inches by mid-afternoon Thursday. It was the most snow recorded at the airport since 7.5 inches on February 17, 1978. The new storm was taking a more southerly route than the previous two. Accumulations of up to 5 inches were predicted for parts of southeast Mississippi and southwest and south central Alabama overnight Thursday into Friday. Although the amount of snowfall predicted lessens as the storm moves through Georgia and South Carolina on Friday, isolated spots could see up to 6 inches, forecasters said. CNN's Deb Kranjak contributed to this report.","Collapsed roof at fire station punctures a natural gas line, igniting the blaze .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- A Haitian attorney representing 10 Americans charged with kidnapping for trying to take 33 children out of Haiti told CNN Sunday he has resigned. Edwin Coq said he had quit as a lawyer for the Americans. It wasn't immediately clear who would replace him. ""I know that they have been looking at other lawyers,"" said Phyllis Allison, mother of one of those detained, Jim Allen. ""They don't know what to do."" The 10 missionaries, including group leader Laura Silsby, were charged Thursday with kidnapping children and criminal association. Coq had said that court hearings would be held Monday and Tuesday for his clients, who have been split up at two prisons. He has tried to get the Americans released, though he has also blamed Silsby for the missionaries' legal troubles. Conviction on the kidnapping charge would carry a maximum penalty of life in prison; the criminal association charge would carry a penalty of three to nine years, according to a former justice minister. The Americans were turned back a week ago as they tried to take the children across the border into the Dominican Republic without proper documentation. They said they were going to house them in a converted hotel in that country and later move them to an orphanage they were building there. The Americans have said they were just trying to help the children leave the earthquake-stricken country. A January 12 earthquake flattened Haiti's capital and killed more than 200,000 people. ""Except for Laura -- the group's leader, who took the responsibility to displace these 33 children, fully knowing she didn't have any legal document that would allow her to do so -- the other nine American citizens didn't know anything about what was going on and I remain convinced that they would not have given their accord,"" Coq told CNN. Coq added that Silsby ""said she had no intention to do any harm."" Some of the detained Americans have said they thought they were helping orphans, but their interpreters told CNN this week that they were present when group members spoke with some of the children's parents. Some parents in a village outside Port-au-Prince said they had willingly given their children to the Americans, who promised them a better life. The parents also said they were told they could see their children whenever they wanted. The Dominican consul general has said he warned Silsby about trying to cross the border without proper documents. Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" Thursday that the judge in the case has three months to decide whether to prosecute. ""We hope that he will decide long before those three months,"" he said. ""He can release them, he can ask to prosecute them."" If a decision is made to prosecute, the case would be heard before a jury, he said. Bellerive told CNN the Haitian government was open to the possibility of the case being transferred to a U.S. court, but he said the request would have to come from the United States. ""Until now, I was not asked,"" he said. Coq told CNN he had been hired by Eric Thompson, husband of Carla Thompson, one of the arrested missionaries, on behalf of the families.","Ten Americans ""have been looking at other lawyers,"" mother of one detainee says .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Iran's supreme leader is warning the thousands of people who have been protesting last week's presidential vote to maintain self-restraint or face a stiff reaction from authorities. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks to a crowd in Tehran during Friday prayers. Members of the opposition -- who have staged noisy demonstrations for the last six days to protest what they believe was a rigged election -- are weighing their options after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei drew a line in the sand during his all-important sermon during Friday prayers. The supreme leader declared last week's presidential election a ""definitive victory"" for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and sloughed off charges of vote tampering. ""Any extremist move will fan up another extremist move,"" said Khamenei, who criticized the street protests and said those who caused violence during demonstrations would be held accountable. ""If the political elite want to ignore law and break the law and take wrong measures which are harmful willy nilly, they will be held accountable for all the violence and blood and rioting."" Khamenei called on those who don't believe the results to use proper legal avenues, such as requesting a recount they could observe.  Watch Khamenei deny allegations of vote-rigging » . He did not, however, issue a call for a new vote -- a move that opposition leaders such as Mir Hossein Moussavi have been demanding. Instead, he passionately defended the election as he addressed a crowd at Tehran University. The election is expected to be a topic of conversation on Saturday before the Guardian Council, which supervises the country's elections. A council official said the body has invited three candidates -- Moussavi, Mehdi Barrubi, and Mohsen Rezaie -- to its meeting to discuss any issues they see fit, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency.  Watch Khamenei defend the outcome of the election » . More protest rallies are planned for Saturday -- one sponsored by supporters of opposition candidates Moussavi and Karrubi and another by supporters of former President Mohammed Khatami. While both camps said they had no plans to cancel the marches, the Interior Ministry told FARS news agency there were no permits issued for either event. Analysts and observers are now debating what will happen next as more developments emerged on Friday. ""We do not yet know whether Ahmadinejad will stay, whether Mousavi will somehow be given a second chance, and if the ongoing political struggle will affect the security of the Supreme Leader,"" Anthony H. Cordesman of the Center for Strategic & International Studies wrote in a paper published Friday after the speech.  Watch CNN's Christiane Amanpour describe what she saw while reporting on Iran election » . He said that it's clear Khamenei is backing Ahmadinejad and any review of the election will be under those loyal to the supreme leader. But at the same time, Khamenei ""cannot put this genie back in the bottle."" ""Whatever happens, if Ahmadinejad stays without a truly legitimate election, the result will fester, not go away. Every embarrassing new piece of excessive rhetoric, every new threat to Iran's neighbors, every new problem in the economy, and every new act of social repression will be a reminder of the fact that Iran's leadership has questionable legitimacy at best,"" Cordesman wrote. Human rights monitor Amnesty International issued a statement on Friday saying Khamenei's sermon ""indicates the authorities' readiness to launch violent crackdowns if people continue to protest which may cause a widespread loss of life."" ""We are extremely disturbed at statements made by Ayatollah Khamenei which seem to give the green light to security forces to violently handle protesters exercising their right to demonstrate and express their views,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty's deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa program. ""If large numbers of people take to the street in protests in the next couple of days, we fear that they will face arbitrary arrest and excessive use of force, as has happened in recent days."" The group said Khamenei should have warned security to act with restraint. ""For a head of state to put the onus of security on peaceful demonstrators and not on the security forces is a gross dereliction of duty and a license for abuse,"" Sahraoui said on Friday. Ahmadinejad got more than 24 million votes, defeating Moussavi, his main challenger, Khamenei said. He called the result plausible. ""Eleven million votes difference? Sometimes there's a margin of 100,000, 200,000, or 1 million maximum. Then one can doubt maybe there has been some rigging or manipulation or irregularities. But there's a difference of 11 million votes. How can vote rigging happen?"" he asked. He lauded the election as a ""political earthquake."" ""It was a great manifestation of people's participation in the affairs of their country. It depicted very well people's solidarity with their establishment,"" he said. Khamenei praised the 85 percent voter turnout of about 40 million people, but said that some critics ""wanted to indicate that as a doubtful victory; some even wanted to show that this is a national defeat. They wanted to give you bad taste in the mouth."" He also criticized what he said was a media narrative that the election pitted people who support the government against those who don't. He said all four candidates support the Islamic revolution. ""Enemies try through various media, and some of those media belong to the Zionists, ill-wishers. They try to make believe in those media that there is a fight between supporters of the Islamic establishment and the opposition. No, that's not true,"" he said.  Watch CNN's Kara Finnstrom on how information is coming out of Iran » . At various junctures through the talk, the crowd chanted ""Allah is Great,"" ""Death to Israel,"" ""Death to America,"" and ""Death to Britain."" The supreme leader took on the United States, Britain, and Israel and apparently people in Iran, accusing them of manipulating and undermining the process. The comments prompted Britain's Foreign Office to summon Iran's ambassador to Britain.  Watch how world has reacted to the election » . The U.S. House of Representatives on Friday overwhelmingly approved a resolution that supports ""all Iranians who embrace the values of freedom, human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law."" A similar measure was being prepared in the Senate. And President Obama, in an interview with CBS News, said he was ""very concerned -- based on some of the tenor and tone of the statements that have been made -- that the government of Iran recognize that the world is watching. ""And how they approach and deal with people who are, through peaceful means, trying to be heard will, I think, send a pretty clear signal to the international community about what Iran is and is not,"" Obama said. Since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, sermons during Friday prayers have been delivered by prominent officials, including by the supreme leader on usually important occasions. This appearance comes at what observers call a critical juncture in Iranian history, and since last Friday, tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken  to the streets of Iran's capital to protest the election results. When Iranian TV airs Friday prayers, the camera regularly focuses on important officials. In this case, the event was noteworthy for who was and who was not there. iReport.com: Share images from Iran . Ahmadinejad and Rezaie were there, but Karrubi and Moussavi -- who called for a boycott of the prayers -- were not seen. Parliament speaker Ali Larijani, who has had a tense relationship in the past with Ahmadinejad, was sitting next to the president. But former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who has been in a power struggle with Khamenei, wasn't shown on the TV broadcast. Rafsanjani is chairman of the Assembly of Experts -- which is responsible for appointing or removing the supreme leader and monitoring that body's attitudes toward Khamenei. Khamenei remained staunch in his defense of Ahmadinejad, saying his views were closer to the president's than to those of Hashemi Rafsanjani, a supporter of Moussavi. The supreme leader at the same time defended Rafsanjani from charges of corruption made by the president during the presidential debate. However, he opened the door to corruption charges against Rafsanjani's relatives. Khatami, a supporter of Moussavi, wasn't seen as well. In discussing Iran's support of human rights, Khamenei slammed U.S. policies in Afghanistan and Iraq . There have been arrests and casualties since the election, with Amnesty International saying reports suggest up to 15 people have died. The government maintains the death toll is seven. An activist told CNN that the death toll has climbed to 32 across the nation, with 12 of those victims in Tehran. Iranian TV Thursday night aired confessions from people who authorities say were paid to destabilize Iran. TV aired remarks from some ""terrorists"" who said the United States paid them to come from Iraq to Iran for the purposes of committing terrorist acts against the Iranian leadership.

"(CNN) -- A Michigan man could face life in prison after he allegedly tortured and ultimately killed his girlfriend's 4-year-old son last week for wetting his pants, prosecutors say. Brandon Joshua-Frederick Hayes, 24, ""systematically beat"" Dominick Calhoun, 4, ""pummeling [him] with fists and kicking him"" on his arms, legs and genitalia, Genesee County prosecutor David Leyton told CNN. Hayes also apparently burned the boy in the course of the torture. ""The knuckles across one hand were charred,"" Argentine Township police chief Dan Allen said. ""I've been doing this a long time, and this is the worst case of child abuse I've ever seen,"" the police chief said. ""In all respects, he was tortured."" Prosecutors arraigned Hayes on Thursday on nine charges, including one count of first-degree premeditated murder, one count of first-degree child abuse and one count of torture, which by itself carries a possible life sentence. ""Little Dominick met his boogeyman, and that was defendant Hayes,"" Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell said at a news conference Thursday. CNN was unable to reach someone who could speak on Hayes' behalf. Hayes' motivation for his savage multiday attack on the boy was that the child ""had wet his pants,"" Leyton said. ""It had happened before."" Hayes also resented the child because his ""biological father wouldn't pay child support,"" Leyton said. Dominick's mother, Corrine Baker, was present for at least some of the beating and tried to shield the boy from Hayes' aggression, authorities said. ""She tried to lay on top of the child to guard the child against being beat any further, but she was beat in the process,"" according to the police chief. The sequence of events that led to the discovery of the abuse began when Baker's sister and several acquaintances came to the apartment to buy drugs from Hayes, according to Allen. After seeing Dominick's condition, the sister alerted the boy's paternal grandfather, who in turn contacted authorities. When emergency responders entered the apartment on the afternoon of April 11, Dominick was ""barely alive."" EMS transferred him to Hurley Hospital in Flint, where he was pronounced brain dead. The boy was taken off life support the following morning. Dominick's mother's whereabouts and actions through all portions of the torture session remain somewhat hazy. The county prosecutor said his office is ""still investigating her involvement in all this."" ""She's also culpable for putting him in the dangerous position in the first place,"" he added. Baker was taken into custody on Sunday but released later. Attempts to reach her at her home Thursday evening were unsuccessful. The town police chief said Baker and her son had been brought to the attention of Genesee County Department of Child Services on several occasions. The agency did not respond to CNN's requests for comment Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether Baker's involvement with the child services agency predated her relationship with Hayes. The police chief said he believed Baker and Hayes had been together for about six months.","Brandon Joshua-Frederick Hayes, 24, arraigned on nine charges .

"(CNN)  -- When I first joined the Navy, I had no idea that I was gay. I was well into my career when I realized this fact, but I was doing well as evidenced by the awards and promotions I was receiving. In addition, I really enjoyed what I was doing and felt I was making a difference. So I opted to continue to serve, even though I knew that I would have to hide my true identity. For most of my career in the Navy, I lived two lives and went to work each day wondering if that would be my last. Whenever the admiral would call me to his office, 99.9 percent of me was certain that it was to discuss an operational issue. But there was always that fear in the back of my mind that somehow I had been ""outed,"" and he was calling me to his office to tell me that I was fired. So many simple things that straight people take for granted could have ended my career, even a comment such as ""My partner and I went to the movies last night."" Do you think ""don't ask, don't tell"" should be reversed? In spite of the stress of living under ""don't ask, don't tell"" and the constant fear of losing my job, somehow my partner, Lynne Kennedy, an openly gay reference librarian at the Library of Congress, and I had learned to deal with the policy and make the requisite sacrifices. I had pretended to be straight and played the games most gays in the military are all too familiar with -- not daring to have a picture of Lynne on my desk, being reluctant to go out to dinner with her, telling her not to call me at work except in a real emergency, not going to church together, avoiding shopping for groceries together and generally  staying out of sight of anyone I knew when we were together. I didn't want to have to lie about who Lynne was or have someone conclude that we were more than casual friends. But it was the events of September 11, 2001, that caused me to appreciate fully the true impact of ""don't ask, don't tell"" on our lives. At 8:30 a.m. on September 11, I went to a meeting in the Pentagon. At 9:30 a.m. I left that meeting. At 9:37 a.m., American Airlines Flight No. 77 slammed into the Pentagon and destroyed the exact space I had left less than eight minutes earlier, killing seven of my colleagues. In the days and weeks that followed, I went to several funerals and memorial services for shipmates who had been killed. Most of my co-workers attended these services with their spouses whose support was critical at this difficult time, yet I was forced to go alone. As the numbness began to wear off, it hit me how incredibly alone Lynne would have been had I been killed. The military is known for how it pulls together and helps people; we talk of the ""military family,"" which is a way of saying we always look after each other, especially in times of need. But none of that support would have been available for Lynne, because under ""don't ask, don't tell,"" she couldn't exist. In fact, Lynne would have been one of the last people to know had I been killed, because nowhere in my paperwork or emergency contact information had I dared to list her name. This realization caused us to stop and reassess exactly what was most important in our lives. During that process, we realized that the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy was causing us to make a much bigger sacrifice than either of us had ever admitted. Eight months later, in June 2002, I retired after more than 29 years in the U.S. Navy, an organization I will always love and respect. We are now committed to doing everything we possibly can to get rid of ""don't ask, don't tell"" so that our military can finally be open to all qualified and motivated individuals who want to serve their country. As a retired naval officer, I am especially pleased with the leadership that Navy Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has demonstrated on repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell."" I believe that the end of the policy is in sight. I have every confidence that our military will easily adjust to this change and that with strong leadership, we will ultimately be stronger and better for it. Ironically, it was in the military that I learned to work with people of different backgrounds, different religions, different ethnicities and different skin colors and to focus on getting the mission accomplished. I learned the importance of respecting everyone and judging people on their performance and abilities, not on a preconceived prejudice. Twenty-six countries allow gays to serve openly in their militaries, and from all reports, things are going just fine. This is the right step for our country, our military and for gay people both currently serving and those who would like to be part of the world's finest military. I have great love and respect for our country, but I know we can do better than ""don't ask, don't tell."" The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Joan E. Darrah.","Joan E.

"(CNN) -- Remember Conficker? About 5 million computers still are believed to be infected with the Conficker worm. The hugely talked-about computer worm seemed poised to wreak havoc on the world's machines on April Fool's Day. And then ... nothing much happened. But while the doom and gloom forecast for the massive botnet -- a remotely controlled network that security experts say infected about 5 million computers -- never came to pass, Conficker is still making some worm hunters nervous. Phillip Porras, program director at SRI International, a nonprofit research group, said Conficker infects millions of machines around the world. And the malware's author or authors could use that infected network to steal information or make money off of the compromised computer users. ""Conficker does stand out as one of those bots that is very large and has been able to sustain itself on the Web,"" which is rare, said Porras, who also is a member of the international group tracking Conficker. Still, computer users, even those infected with Conficker, haven't seen much in the way of terrifying results. After the botnet relaunched April 1, it gained further access to an army of computers that the program's author or authors could control. The only thing the author or authors have done with that power, though, is to try to sell fake computer-security software to a relatively small segment of Conficker-stricken computers, Porras said. The lack of a major attack has led some people in the security community to assume that the worm is basically dead. Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer with F-Secure, an Internet security company, says the people who created Conficker would have launched a major offensive by now if they were going to. Hypponen, who is scheduled to speak about the Conficker botnet next week at Black Hat, a major computer security conference, said he thinks whoever made Conficker didn't mean for the worm to get so large, as the size of the botnet drew widespread attention from the security community and the media. ""This gang, they knew their stuff. They used cutting-edge technology that we had never before. ... I've been working in viruses for 20 years, and there were several things that I'd never seen at all,"" he said. ""That, to me, would tell that perhaps this is a new group or a new gang, someone who tried it for the first time."" He added, ""The more experienced attackers don't let their viruses or their worms spread this widely. They, on purpose, keep their viruses smaller in size in order to keep them from headlines."" Veteran botnet creators tend to hold the size of the malicious networks to about 2,000 to 10,000 computers to keep from being noticed, he said. ""Even if the [Conficker] gang would want to continue operations, most likely they would drop the current botnet and start something new,"" he said. Don DeBolt, director of threat research for CA, an information technology company, said researchers are still watching Conficker. ""It's still being tracked, so it is still active out there, but certainly the threat has been mitigated by all of the attention and focus that it has received,"" he said. DeBolt said the press hyped the Conficker story because it was tied to April Fool's Day and because it made so many computers vulnerable to attack. He said other viruses and botnets pose more serious threats. Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos, a computer security company, said the infected Conficker network is still growing. ""The interesting thing is, the hackers never really did much with the botnet that they created. So they created an army of lots and lots of computers ... but they've never really done anything with it,"" he said. ""They were almost frightened off doing it."" Others disagree with that assessment. Hypponen said Conficker was not hype; it was the largest network of its kind seen since 2003 and deserved the attention it got from the security community and from the public. Porras said theories about the the motives of Conficker's creator are based on speculation. The important thing, he said, is that security experts will continue to work to reduce the number of computers infected with the worm.","Conficker, a feared computer worm, hasn't caused much damage yet .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Three U.S. Navy aviators are missing at sea after a command and control plane crashed over the Atlantic on Wednesday night, Navy officials said Thursday. The E-2C Hawkeye is a command and control aircraft. The E-2C  Hawkeye was conducting exercises off the Virginia-North Carolina coast. The plane crashed after it launched from the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman about 11 p.m. Wednesday, Navy officials said. Navy officials said they do not know what caused the plane to crash, and search and rescue missions are under way from units on the Truman, the carrier USS Eisenhower and the Coast Guard. The twin-engine plane usually carries a crew of five, but had only three aboard during the flight. The plane was part of a training squadron, VAW 120, and is based at the Naval Station Norfolk in southern Virginia. E-mail to a friend .

"Dallas, Texas (CNN) -- African-American workers at a Texas pipe factory endured a string of racial slurs and harassment and were targeted by their managers when they complained, federal investigators have determined. Black employees at the Turner Industries plant in Paris, Texas, regularly ""were subjected to unwelcome racial slurs, comments and intimidation, racial graffiti, nooses in the workplace and other symbols of discrimination,"" the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reported. Black workers also were denied promotions and disciplined more harshly than whites, the agency concluded in a three-page letter in late March. Managers at the plant not only were aware of a ""hostile environment,"" they also targeted workers who complained and disciplined white employees who opposed the harassment, the EEOC found. The EEOC has called on Turner Industries, based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to join talks aimed at producing a ""just resolution"" to the problems. The company said its plant ""is free from any form of discrimination, retaliation, or any other workplace conduct that violates the law."" ""We are disappointed that the EEOC has issued this determination and strongly disagree with the EEOC's findings,"" Michael Phelps, Turner Industries' vice president for human resources, said in a written statement. Lawyers for the seven Turner employees who went to the EEOC displayed photographs of the slurs, of hanging nooses and threatening notes left for employees at the Paris plant during a news conference Wednesday. One of those employees, Dontrail Mathis, told reporters that he was frequently called racially inflammatory names and that most African-American employees were relegated to the paint shop. Mathis, a painter's helper, said one co-worker who found out he was married to a white woman told him, ""In the Bible, it says that white women shouldn't mix with monkeys."" When he called Turner's corporate office to complain about that incident, he heard nothing back, Mathis said. ""I tried to back away from it. It kept going and going and coming and coming,"" he said. Jason Milligan, a former night foreman at the plant, said his bosses ""more or less wanted me to do their dirty work."" ""I watched certain people more than I did the others, to see if I could get anything on them that could be used against them,"" he said. But he said he was fired after he refused to sign an affidavit accusing a Turner employee of theft -- a man he believed had been ""set up."" ""I'm not going to lie for anyone,"" Milligan said. ""He was a man just like me. He has a family to take care of. I'm not going to do it. And from then on, that was my down-slide."" Milligan worked at the plant for nine months before he was fired. Company officials told him he was sacked for failing a drug test, he said. But a lawyer for the employees, Jay Ellwanger, said Milligan warned testers that he was taking a diet medication that could show up as a stimulant. Milligan said managers were told to document and clean off any racist graffiti immediately, but he said one such case he handled in his nine months at the plant was ""swept under the rug"" when the person behind it turned out to be a relative of another manager. In the year since workers in the Paris plant went to the EEOC, similar complaints have emerged at other Turner factories in Texas, Ellwanger said. Paris is about 110 miles northeast of Dallas. The Rev. Peter Johnson, a state civil rights leader, said the problems reported at the Turner plant reflect a ""culture of discrimination"" that lingers in East Texas. ""East Texas is Mississippi 50 years ago. This case will begin to help us unravel the history of discrimination and bigotry throughout East Texas,"" he said. CNN's Tracy Sabo and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","Investigators say African-American pipe factory workers endured racial slurs, harassment .

"(CNN) -- A woman convicted in the 2002 kidnapping of Utah teenager Elizabeth Smart pleaded guilty in the attempted kidnapping of Smart's cousin a month later, court officials said Monday. In exchange for Wanda Barzee's plea of guilty but mentally ill to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping, prosecutors dropped state charges against her in Smart's abduction, said Nancy Volmer, spokeswoman for Utah state courts. Barzee, 64, pleaded guilty in November to federal charges of kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor in connection with Smart's abduction. As part of that plea agreement, she agreed to cooperate with the state and federal cases against her husband, Brian David Mitchell, federal prosecutors have said. Barzee and Mitchell were accused of abducting Smart, then 14, at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family's Salt Lake City home in June 2002. Smart was found nine months later, walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy, Utah, in the company of Barzee and Mitchell, a drifter and self-described prophet who calls himself Emmanuel and had done some handyman work at the Smarts' home. The month after Smart was kidnapped, prosecutors alleged, Barzee and Mitchell attempted to break into the home of her cousin, but were unsuccessful. The girl was 15 years old at the time, according to CNN affiliate KSL. She is not named in court documents. ""Mr. Mitchell's attempt was thwarted when the minor child awakened, which caused Mr. Mitchell to flee,"" the court documents said. Following her arrest in 2003, Barzee told authorities that she and Mitchell went to the home in order to abduct the girl, and planned to hold her, along with Smart, in the couple's camp in the mountains, according to court documents. Sentencing is set for May 21 on the state charge, Volmer said. Barzee faces between one and 15 years in prison, but prosecutors have agreed to allow that sentence to run concurrently with her federal sentence, according to court documents. Federal prosecutors have recommended a sentence of 15 years in prison for her in exchange for her cooperation against Mitchell. Federal sentencing was set for May 19, but a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors has said a sentence would not be imposed until Barzee's cooperation against Mitchell is complete. At the hearing in federal court, Barzee apologized to Smart, according to a transcript. ""I'm greatly humbled as I realize how much Elizabeth Smart has been victimized and the role I played in it,"" she said. ""I'm so sorry, Elizabeth, for all the pain and suffering I have caused you and your family. It is my hope that you will be able to find it in your heart to forgive me one day."" Barzee had been housed at the Utah State Hospital while courts determined her competency as well as Mitchell's. After years of being declared incompetent, she recently was declared competent to stand trial, according to the Salt Lake Tribune newspaper. A state court had ruled she could be forcibly medicated, and that ruling led federal prosecutors to proceed with bringing a case against the couple, the Tribune said. At a competency hearing for Mitchell in October, Smart, now 21, testified that she had been held captive in Utah and California. Just after her abduction, Mitchell took her to a wooded area behind her home and performed a mock marriage ceremony with her, she said. During the nine months of her captivity, Smart testified, no 24-hour period passed without her being raped by Mitchell. U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball has not yet ruled on Mitchell's competency. State court proceedings are on hold pending the outcome of the federal case. CNN's Ashley Hayes and Eliott McLaughlin contributed to this report.","In exchange for plea, Barzee's state charges in Smart's abduction have been dropped .

"(CNN) -- President Obama should end the legal seminar on the rights of terrorists. He should instruct the lawyers at the State and Justice departments and Pentagon that the debate is over. The time has come for all to accept that terrorists cannot be treated as criminals. The main reason is that security requires preventing attacks rather than prosecuting the perpetrators after an attack. This is particularly evident when we concern ourselves with terrorists who may acquire weapons of mass destruction. It also holds for terrorists who are willing to commit suicide attacks: They cannot be tried, and they pay no mind to what might be done to them after their assault. Finally, even terrorists not bent on committing suicide attacks are often ""true believers"" who are prepared to proceed despite whatever punishments the legal system may throw at them. In contrast to prevention, law enforcement often springs into action after a criminal has acted: when a body is found, a bank has been robbed or a child has been kidnapped. By and large, the criminal law approach is retrospective rather than prospective. Law enforcement assumes that punishment serves to deter future crimes -- not to eliminate them, but to keep them at a socially acceptable level. This will not do for the likes of Osama bin Laden. Nor should terrorists be treated as soldiers, a dignified profession and calling. Soldiers wear uniforms that allow one to tell foes from civilians and thus prevent harming the latter when fighting the former. And the insignias that mark soldiers make it clear which governments they serve, governments that can be held accountable for their conduct -- obligations terrorists refuse to discharge. They cannot have it both ways: flout the rules of war and seek the benefits of these rules as prisoners of war. Obama surely has the legal training to realize that our minds are big enough to cope with more than two categories, that terrorists are neither fish nor fowl, neither criminals nor soldiers, but a distinct species. As such, terrorists are not without any rights. They should not be killed if they can be captured without undue risk; they should not be tortured; and their detention should be subject to, say, annual review by an institutional board -- composed of people who have security clearance, not necessarily military officers. Such a board should follow simplified procedures, as parole boards do in prisons, rather than those of civilian courts or military commissions. Click here for more on this subject from Etzioni . Terrorists should not be entitled to face their accusers, or else we would divulge the sources and methods of our information-gathering about their nefarious acts. And they should not be released until we have strong reasons to hold that they are no longer a danger to us, our allies or anyone else. The Obama administration's position is so multifaceted that even someone who follows it closely and has considerable training cannot make out what line it is following. Some terrorists are to be tried in civilian courts -- as long as they are not in New York, or maybe only if the civilian courts are located on a military base. Or terrorists may be kept at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, or shipped to countries that do not abide by our rules or maybe only to those that do. No one can build public support and legitimacy for such a cacophony of positions and voices. It is time to settle the matter and tell the government lawyers to move on.

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Lisa Alexander woke up early on February 18, the same way she does every morning. ""My alarm usually goes off at 4:30, 4:45,"" she said. ""I lay in the bed and kind of plan out my day."" She had no idea that her life was about to be targeted by a man with a vendetta against the government. She got up, woke up her son and headed to work at the IRS offices in Austin. ""The first thing I do is get in, organize my desk and wipe it down ... fire up my computer and tell everybody good morning,"" Alexander said. ""Before I know it, the building kind of went to the left and came back ... ""I thought it was an earthquake."" It wasn't. Just a few minutes before 10 a.m., a single-engine Piper Cherokee PA-28 crashed into the multistory building where Alexander worked. ""It was like an explosion,"" she said.  ""The windows started breaking out and the tiles started falling from the ceiling, and then it was dark."" Alexander said she went to check on her co-workers, and they headed for the nearest door. ""As we open the door, this 'poof' sound comes in as if it were a flame or something behind it,"" she said. ""So we immediately shut the door and we smelled that smell, it was probably jet fuel."" They closed the door and stood there, trying to figure out how to escape. ""The first thing that crossed my mind is I'm not going to see my son anymore,"" Alexander said. A few blocks away, Robin DeHaven was driving his truck on his way to install windows when he spotted something strange in the sky. ""I looked on the horizon and I just saw a little dot and ... I'm staring at it like, 'What is this? It doesn't look like a bird or anything.' "" DeHaven said.  ""And I realized it was a plane."" Realizing there was no airport around for miles, he figured the pilot must be having problems. ""When I saw it disappear, within seconds I saw a big plume of black smoke,"" he said.  ""I exited the highway, and I saw that all this smoke was coming from this building. All I saw was all the shattered glass and all the smoke coming out, and I thought, 'Oh jeez, he hit a building.' "" Authorities say they believe the pilot, Joe Stack, had ripped seats out of the small plane and put in a drum of fuel to cause maximum damage.  Stack allegedly set fire to his $230,000 home in Austin before embarking on his fatal flight. Read Stack's apparent suicide note (PDF) Investigators believe Stack targeted the building because it housed IRS offices.  A 3,000-word message on a Web site registered to Stack railed against the government, particularly the IRS. Alexander didn't have time to think about what had happened, or why someone had crashed a plane into her office building. ""We were all screaming for help,"" she said.  ""By that time, the smoke was getting real bad. I kind of crouched down on the floor trying to get some air from under there. ""And [I was thinking] I'm going to have to jump because it's getting worse in here."" The next thing she knew, she saw what she thought was ""an angel from heaven."" Alexander and the others survived.  But the attack killed one of their co-workers, longtime IRS employee Vernon Hunter. He was 68. Alexander said she had a lot of memories of Hunter, whom she worked with before her job at the IRS. ""He'd do anything for you,"" she said. She questioned why he, of all people, had to die.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government is not fully guarding against the contamination of meat by traces of antibiotics, pesticides or heavy metals, a new report warns. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's inspector general said federal agencies have failed to set limits on many potentially harmful chemical residues, which ""has resulted in meat with these substances being distributed in commerce."" When it comes to pesticide traces, only one type is tested for, according to the report. There are also no set limits for some heavy metals, like copper. In 2008, Mexican authorities turned away an American shipment of beef, because it did not meet Mexico's limits when tested for copper traces. But the very same rejected meat could be sold in the United States, since no limit has been set, the analysis says. That example shows ""the government has fallen down on the job here,"" said Tony Corbo of the consumer advocacy group Food and Water Watch. ""Some of the residues that the inspector general cited could be carcinogenic, as they accumulate over a period of time in the body,"" he said. The study focused on contamination by chemical residues, rather than bacteria. While bacteria like E. coli and Salmonella can cause an illness that is acute but brief, chemical residues are more like to build up over time, and no amount of cooking will destroy them. The USDA pledged to ""swiftly implement the corrective actions"" recommended by the inspector, which including testing for more kinds of residue and setting limits on how much of each substance is allowable. A department spokesman pointed out that this kind of fix, which is expected to require coordination with the FDA and the EPA, was one of the main reasons President Obama created a Food Safety Working Group last year. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said in a statement, ""We fully support the critical role of the federal government in ensuring beef safety."" ""While the U.S. beef supply is extraordinarily safe by any nation's standards,"" it added, ""the beef industry is constantly looking for ways to improve the systems that ensure the safest product possible for our consumers."" The study, first reported by USA Today, also says that when cattle test positive for residue, it is difficult to track back where it came from because it often passes through several buyers and sellers. The American Meat Institute said that problem ""underscores the need to implement comprehensive livestock traceback procedures,"" with a national animal identification system.

"(Wired.com) -- Editorial cartoonist Mark Fiore may be good enough to win this year's Pulitzer Prize, but he's evidently too biting to get past the auditors who run Apple's iPhone app store, who ruled that lampooning public figures violated its terms of service. Fiore irked Apple's censorious staffers with his cartoons making fun of the Balloon Boy hoax and the pair that famously crashed a White House party, according to Laura McGann at the Neiman Journalism Lab. Fiore won a Pulitzer Monday for animations he made for the SFGate, the online home of the San Francisco Chronicle. But Fiore, a freelancer who runs a syndication business, was rejected by Apple in December for an app called NewToons that features his work. According to a December 21 e-mail reprinted by Neiman, Apple rejected his app because it ""contains content that ridicules public figures and is in violation of Section 3.3.14 from the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement which states: Applications may be rejected if they contain content or materials of any kind (text, graphics, images, photographs, sounds, etc.) that in Apple's reasonable judgment may be found objectionable, for example, materials that may be considered obscene, pornographic, or defamatory."" Neither Fiore nor Apple responded to requests for comment. The news of the rejection comes not long after Apple decided to purge its app store of content that included nudity, a retroactive ban that included apps from respected German publications such as Bild and Der Spiegel. Fiore's rejection may be especially disconcerting to news and media organizations, many of which are betting heavily on iPad apps as a way to get users to pay to read magazines and newspapers, and to get advertisers to pay print-ad prices for online content. (Online ads cost a small percentage of what ads in glossy magazines cost, in no small part because the net has almost infinite advertising space.) Apple has built a little slab of Disneyland with its iPad, which is meant to be an experience unsullied by provocative or crude material. It's beautiful and enticing -- the company has already sold more than a half million of them in the first two weeks it's been available -- but it's not the real world. Publishers, including such august organizations such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Wired.com's parent company Condé Nast, see a solution to their declining dead-tree ad sales in building a pay-to-play attraction in that park. But they need to understand that to do so, they have to play by Mickey Mouse's rules. The signs have been there from the start, as Wired.com's Brian Chen pointed out in February. Apple banned an e-book reading application once because it figured out that iPhone users could use it to read a free version of the Kama Sutra. Then last week, Apple abruptly banned apps developed using programs that translate apps into multiple platforms. Adding the news of Fiore's ban to that, the publishing world is now officially on notice that the iPad is Apple's, and unlike with their print and web editions, they don't have the final say when it comes to their own content on an Apple device.

"(CNN) -- The captain and chief officer of a Chinese-registered ship that ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef will appear in an Australian court Thursday, charged with damaging the reef. The Shen Neng 1 veered more than 27 kilometers (17 miles) off course and ended up on a shoal in the Reef on April 3, prompting concerns of an oil spill near the world's largest coral reef system. On Wednesday, the Australian Federal Police announced that they have arrested the 47-year-old Chinese master of the vessel and the 44-year-old chief officer. The captain was charged with liability for the vessel. He faces a maximum fine of A$55,000 (U.S. $50,852). The chief officer is accused of being on watch when the ship caused the damage. He faces up to three years in prison and a fine of A$220,000 (U.S. $203,411). Authorities did not disclose the name of either man. The ship was carrying about 65,000 tons of coal to China from the Australian port of Gladstone when it ran aground on the shoal -- a combination of shell and sand -- near the southernmost point of the Great Barrier Reef, just north of Great Keppel Island. About 950 tons of oil were on board. A small oil slick caused by the ship's grounding did not threaten the Great Barrier Reef after crews sprayed dispersants on it and surface netting helped to contain it. Officials said the ship's captain had a 10-mile-wide channel to navigate through in an area where pilots aren't needed -- a relatively wide open section of sea, 70 kilometers (43 miles) off shore and away from the larger mass of coral most people associate with the Great Barrier Reef. ""He got 15 nautical miles (17.3 miles) off course, which is just outrageous,"" Adam Nicholson, a spokesman for Maritime Safety Queensland, said at the time. Nicholson likened it to a car veering off a 2-mile wide road. ""We have thousands of boats moving in that same space every year and nothing has ever happened like this,"" he said. The Great Barrier Reef is made up of roughly 3,000 individual reefs and 900 islands spanning over 2,600 km (1,600 miles) off the coast of Queensland in the Coral Sea.","Chinese ship officers to appear in court after veering onto Great Barrier Reef .

"Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida (CNN) -- Weather and time have inflicted more damage to Fort Jefferson than hostile cannon fire ever did. The crumbling citadel rises 40 feet from the turquoise water of the Gulf of Mexico, an outpost of a bygone era. Built on an island in Florida's Dry Tortugas, 70 miles past Key West, the fort is being restored by a squad of craftsmen who spend three-week shifts there between hurricane seasons. A cocoon of mesh and scaffolding shrouds one section of its 8-foot-thick walls as they work. It's a grueling job, but it's one Dennis Wood, a mason from Massachusetts, says he's glad to have. ""Things are slow today, you know,"" Wood said. ""Got a job offer to come down here for the winter, so we took it."" Efforts to restore Fort Jefferson have been under way for about 30 years. The current phase received a boost from the economic stimulus bill that passed Congress in 2009, which devoted $7 million to the project. But planners estimate another $13 million is needed, and that money has yet to be allocated. The six-sided fort, roughly the size of Yankee Stadium, was designed to protect shipping lanes through the Gulf of Mexico. Construction began in 1846, but advancements in the science of artillery rendered it obsolete before it was finished. During the Civil War, the Confederacy never bothered to try to seize it from Union forces. The Union kept a garrison of about 2,000 men there and used it mostly as a prison for Confederate captives and deserters. It wasn't until after the war that it received its most famous inmate -- Samuel Mudd, the Maryland doctor convicted of aiding Abraham Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth, by setting his broken leg. Mudd served more than three years at Fort Jefferson before receiving a pardon in 1869. The Army abandoned the fort in 1874, but the islands served as a staging area for U.S. warships during the Spanish-American War in 1898 and housed a seaplane base during World War I. It takes a 2 1/2-hour ride on a catamaran ferry to get to Fort Jefferson. The installation and the surrounding national park draw about 52,000 visitors a year, according to the National Park Service. But more than a century and a half of hurricanes and salt air have taken their toll on the massive walls. The iron shutters that shielded the fort's guns have expanded as they rust, cracking and displacing the surrounding walls. Wood, the six other masons and eight laborers who are working to restore Fort Jefferson were unemployed before this job, said Ken Uracius, the project manager for Enola Contracting Inc., which is doing the work. Uracius estimates about 100 people see some sort of work from the project. ""I have boat captains,"" he said. ""I have people running the boat that brought you out here. I have brick makers, I have cement makers."" Work has gone on periodically for the past 30 years and is likely to go on for many more. But the Park Service says it's important to save a unique monument. ""If we lose Fort Jefferson, that's it,"" said Kelly Clark, who oversees the reconstruction project for the Park Service. ""There are no other Fort Jeffersons.""","Work on Fort Jefferson, 70 miles past Key West, began in 1846 .

"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- I wore a path between Washington and Philly for interviews and shoots for our recent ""Cheating Death"" special with Dr. Sanjay Gupta. In the field: Jeremy Harlan . My job as a photojournalist is to shoot and edit stories for CNN and make sure my news team eats well on the road. On assignment: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . Now, I love cheese steaks as much as the next guy. But my arteries can only take so much steak, cheese and peppers. So here are a few places that are great alternatives in the City of Brotherly Love. Reading Terminal Market . Hours: 8 a.m.-6 p.m. Monday through Saturday; 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Sunday . Cuisine: You name it, the market has it . How do I describe the Reading Terminal Market? It's like the Las Vegas of food. Everywhere you turn, there's something interesting to see, smell and taste. It is food sensory overload. The hardest part of going to the market is not eating the very first thing you see. Give yourself 15 minutes to walk through the market before deciding where to spend your hard-earned lunch dollar. I saw apple dumplings, muffalettas, spanakopita, pulled pork, snapper soup, strombolis, all the fresh veggies, meat and cheese you could throw in your fridge and of course cheese steaks. I finally decided to stop at Dinic's Pork and Beef for the famous roast pork sandwich. The service was fast and friendly. The sandwich was fantastic, and if you sit at the counter long enough, you might hear one of Philly's finest talk about the crazy arrest of the day. And make sure you save room for a smooth and creamy cupcake (or two) from the Flying Monkey. Magic Carpet . Hours: 10:30 a.m.-3 p.m. Cuisine: Mediterranean/vegetarian . The first thing I ask our local contact on a story is where I'm eating lunch. If you ask Holly Auer, University of Pennsylvania Hospital's senior medical communications officer, she'll immediately say, ""Magic Carpet."" This vegetarian culinary delight is actually a small vendor trailer just across from Penn Hospital. If you haven't been to Philly, you need to know this city takes its street vendor food pretty seriously. I still scratch my head at how these folks make so much delicious food in such cramped quarters. My personal favorite at Magic Carpet is a pita sandwich stuffed with grape leaves. It's so good, I usually eat two. Maybe the best part: The sandwiches are around five bucks. Definitely the worst part: the long line of neurosurgeons, med students, nurses and cardiologists waiting for their delicious ride on the Carpet, too. The Franklin Fountain . Hours: noon-midnight . Cuisine: Ice cream . The Franklin Fountain is a cool escape back to the early 20th-century ice cream fountain shop. Although it opened in the summer of 2004, you would think it was 1944 when you walk in the door. The owners left no detail ignored in building this dairy delight. The fountain offers sundaes, splits, ice cream waffle sandwiches, fresh pies, house-made cakes, phosphates and America's oldest soft drink, just to name a few. Coffee lovers will enjoy the Lightning Rod sundae. Everyone will enjoy his or her trip back in time.","CNN's Jeremy Harlan talks about his favorite places to eat in Philadelphia .

"Richmond, Virginia (CNN) -- ""I'm a big history buff,"" President Obama said in an interview with ABC News"" George Stephanopoulos. ""And I think that understanding the history of the Confederacy and understanding the history of the Civil War is something that every American and every young American should be part of."" I am sometimes asked the same question that Mr. Stephanopoulos put to President Obama: Why study Confederate history? And I agree with the president's response. As we approach the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, we look back to its centennial in the 1960s. A lot has happened in this country since then, and our appreciation of the lessons of history has changed with the times. One constant has been the importance of the Civil War. It remains as the most important era of American history, a time when America withstood its biggest challenges to a constitutional democracy which then was still viewed as an experiment in a new form of government. The crucible of war defined the nation as we know it today, as we became ""indivisible"" and ""with liberty and justice for all"" for the first time. During the 1960s, we Americans looked at the war as it occurred on the battlefields, because the conduct and course of the war dominated every single moment of every day. And the Confederate soldiers have historically captured our fascination even more than the Union soldiers. Perhaps it is the gallantry and dash of leaders like Robert E. Lee or Stonewall Jackson or J.E.B. Stuart. Or perhaps it was the common enlisted men in the Confederate ranks, whose valor and courage -- in the face of tremendous privation and against overwhelming odds -- makes them stand out in world history as one of the best bodies of soldiers ever known. Another perspective on the Confederacy and history . If the fascination with soldiers continues from the 1960s to today, what has changed? Today, the study of Confederate history is much more ""inclusive"" -- to use the word of choice for many state's 150th anniversary commissions -- as we look more deeply into the past. Today we ask different questions of history and I think we get better answers. Let me list just a few of those questions. What about slavery? We did not talk much about it in the 1960s. Today, we cannot study the Confederacy without studying 40 percent of its population. So now we look long and hard at this aspect of American history, including its existence and importance in the North. We see so clearly today that it was a wrong, so we need to ask why so many people 150 years ago did not see it as wrong and why several of the important Christian denominations split apart over this issue before the country itself split. What about the slaves themselves? Why did many take advantage of the first opportunity to escape to freedom while others remained ""loyal"" to the South? And what about the 400,000 African-Americans in the South who were free long before Abraham Lincoln came on the scene? iReporter: Civil War history could have been ""teachable moment"" What about the Southerners who remained loyal to the Union and chose to fight in blue, rather than gray? What about the thousands of immigrants who ""escaped"" the wars of Europe yet enlisted in both armies to demonstrate their loyalty to their new country? At the opposite end of the spectrum, what about the Native Americans who had been here long before any Europeans, yet allied with the Confederacy? The last Confederate brigade to surrender was composed entirely of Native Americans and commanded by Brigadier General Stand Watie, a full-blooded Cherokee. What about the very important Jewish community in the South? Many served in the ranks while others saw civilian service, such as Judah Benjamin, who had three different Cabinet posts, or Phoebe Pember, who became the head nurse at Chimborazo, the biggest hospital in the world. And what about the women of the South? The war thrust them into new positions of responsibility and many continued after the war to lead public enterprises that engendered self-esteem and respect. We Americans -- from native Americans to those who have ancestors who wore the blue or gray to those who are descended from slaves to those who have recently come to our shores -- want to know ourselves. We want to understand why our country is different from the others around the world. This is why millions of Americans read so many books about the Civil War or visit the battlefields or come to museums like The Museum of the Confederacy so that they can see first hand the ingredients that formed us. And this is why so many foreigners come to America to visit those same sites in order to understand why we are who we are. The fact is that we must know the Civil War if we are to know America. And to know the Civil War, we must know and understand the Confederacy -- in all of its diversity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of S. Waite Rawls III.","S.

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is the broadband television network of VICE. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- In this installment of the Vice Guide to Film, VBS co-founder Shane Smith travels to Russia to meet the pioneers of one of the most peculiar experimental film movements in history: Parallel Cinema. The genre marries Soviet avant-garde agitprop filmmaking (black and white, silent, odd angles, extreme closeups, rapid fire editing of good Soviets at work) with something called ""Necro-realism,"" a movement spearheaded by filmmaker Yvegny Yufit and consisting of very weird gay male zombie flicks that feature fat bald men having sex and eating each other's brains. It was meant to be a comment on the impending fall of the Soviet system and the decadence of the apparatchiks in charge. It grew to become much more. While Russia is known for its experimental works of the 1920s -- auteurs like Dziga Vertov and Sergei Eisenstein spring to mind -- this freedom of expression ended when Stalin took power. For 60 years, Russian film was dominated by the drab, state-approved imagery of Socialist realism. This genre was defined by stark scenes of the proletariat soldiering and toiling diligently over the land. Making movies outside this milieu meant that the film-lovers, artists, actors and rock musicians who collaborated to create it were risking life and limb at the hands of the KGB. But when the Soviet Union collapsed, the threat of its primary intelligence agency diminished and Russian filmmakers began to unleash six decades of pent-up creative energy. The films that emerged were an insane mish-mash of booze, violence, surrealism and insanity. Parallel Cinema was born. Watch the rest of Russian Parallel Cinema at VBS.TV . For this episode, Shane journeys to Moscow and St. Petersburg to meet several of the surviving founders of Parallel Cinema and Necro-realism, many of whom are today extremely successful commercial producers and directors. In fact, a few of them now run some of the country's key networks and continue to make films. Shane manages to uncover this fascinating underground art community and finds that to this day the Parallel Cinema movement thrives. The devoted still have weekly Parallel screenings and events, and even put out a monthly film publication. Still, as he immerses himself in this unique film tradition, it becomes clear that, given Russian's present volatility, it may not exist much longer.","VBS journalist meets pioneers of ""most peculiar"" experimental film movement .

"Washington (CNN) -- The acting head of the Transportation Security Administration gingerly answered questions Thursday about whether new full-body imaging machines will detect concealed explosives like that allegedly placed in the underwear of the Christmas Day bomber. The deployment of 150 of those machines in front-line use at 11 U.S. airports is to be announced Friday by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, TSA officials say. ""Would this machine have detected a bomb on that person?"" Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, asked Gale Rossides, the agency's acting administrator. ""Without going into the specifics of that because of the ongoing criminal investigation, I can tell you that the experience we've had both in the labs and in our [field tests], our officers are identifying objects on the body that are comparable to what that threat was,"" Rossides said. ""Every time?"" Rogers asked. ""Our officers are doing a very good job,"" Rossides answered. ""Every time?"" Rogers pressed. ""I'd have to get back to you, but you know we have very, very good measures in place for evaluating our officers,"" she said. After several unrelated questions, Rogers asked one more question about the machine's capabilities. ""Is this machine the end-all?"" he asked. ""This machine gives us an increased detection capability that is significantly greater than what we have at the checkpoint today,"" she said, adding that her agency is ""driving the manufacturers"" to improve the technology. Rossides testified that the full-body imagers -- which see through clothes, producing a ghostly image of a traveler's body -- will not reveal objects hidden in body cavities. But she said imagers are better at detecting concealed items than a pat down. ""Today, we do not do a full-body pat down that goes into the sensitive parts of the body where that [Christmas Day bomb] was secreted,"" Rossides said. On Friday, Napolitano will announce the first deployment of whole-body imagers as a standard part of checkpoint equipment. Though 40 machines have been deployed at 19 airports nationwide in field tests, Friday's announcement will mark the official beginning of the program, TSA officials said. The new machines will be deployed this weekend in Boston, Massachusetts, and Chicago, Illinois, the agency said Wednesday. It will reveal the remaining airports Friday. The 150 new machines were purchased last fall with federal stimulus money. The agency hopes to deploy nearly 500 units by the end of the year. Under existing protocols, full-body scans are optional at airport checkpoints. Travelers who decline the scans are funneled to a location where they may be given a pat-down and subjected to other tests, such as swabs that can detect minute traces of explosives on hands or luggage. The TSA said most passengers prefer a body scan to a pat-down. But others have objected to the body scans, calling them electronic strip searches. Rossides testified that the machines will not significantly slow the passenger screening process, saying it will be done at the same time as the carry-on baggage screening. The agency has spent years testing whole body imagers. Plans to deploy them this year were given added urgency after the arrest of a Nigerian man, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, who was accused of attempted to detonate an explosive sewn into his underwear aboard a flight December 25.","Homeland security chief to announce deployment of 150 machines .

"(CNN) -- Valera remembered being left in the Russian snow. How he lost his lower arms and some of his toes, he wasn't always sure. At times, he said he was in a fire. The truth of what the 14-year-old experienced in his early years, no one will ever know. The orphanage where he lives said Valera was abandoned as a small child at a hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia. He had gangrene, the result of meningitis and an infection, which forced amputations. He was released to the orphanage in Nizhny Lomov, where he's waited nine years for parents and a home to call his own. On Saturday, Stephen Jack and his wife, Christine, will leave their Goldsboro, North Carolina, home to fly to Russia, the final step in a 15-month journey they hope will give the boy what he's always wanted. ""Having never seen him and only knowing a little bit about him, I still feel attached to that child,"" said Jack, 53, who already has six children, four of them adopted. ""I understand he can talk his way into your heart and mind in no time. When the world is opened up for him, who knows what his capabilities and possibilities are? ... If all goes well, on the 21st he becomes my son."" It is a trip the Jacks will take with trepidation. The actions Thursday of a Tennessee woman who put her adopted 7-year-old son on a plane and returned him to Russia, saying he was violent and that officials misled her family, puts Americans in the process of adopting from Russia on edge. Officials in Moscow have threatened to suspend all American adoptions and the Jacks face a two-week process involving a court appearance and loads of paperwork before they can fly home with Valera. ""What this woman did to us is put us on pins and needles,"" Jack said. ""My wife has been beside herself, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't concerned."" The adoptions of about 3,000 Russian children by Americans are in progress, according to Tom DiFilipo, president of the Joint Council on International Children's Services, an advocacy group for children in need of families. Russia is the second country this year, after Haiti, in which adoptions have been thrown into a tailspin. No suspension has been announced, but mere talk of such a recommendation spawned a campaign on Monday by the council to galvanize the adoption community and child advocates. People are being encouraged to sign a letter to President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev (which will be presented to them Wednesday morning), post blogs and share videos about adoption successes. ""Our message is this is an isolated incident. The adoption system did not fail. What failed was the decision-making process of this adoptive mother,"" DiFilipo said. What Torry Hansen of Tennessee did is ""outrageous and indefensible, and not indicative of the average adoptive parent. One-hundred-thousand people adopt every year. I don't know of another case like this."" The case has rocked the adoption community. ""I talked to parents yesterday, and they're just devastated,"" said Deborah Gray, a child and family therapist, trainer and author, based in Seattle, Washington, who has 20-plus-years experience working on attachment, trauma and grief issues. ""It makes it seem like these kids are defective, that adoption itself is not a permanent status. ... It's a public embarrassment,"" she said. ""The vast majority of families are enriched by adoption. To have this kind of approach is really off the wall. I can't understand why it would have gotten to this point."" Adoptive parents can feel overwhelmed during transition . She and other advocates said they wish Hansen had reached out for assistance and tapped services available for parents before shipping the child back to Russia after six months. ""There are so many services that were available to her. She could have contacted FRUA [Families for Russian and Ukrainian Adoption] which is a resource-rich place, gotten a good psychiatric assessment, including hospitalization if necessary to figure out what made this little guy tick,"" Gray said. The incident may have been a wake-up call to agencies and those in the adoption community to make sure adoptive families are prepared for challenges and have resources for help lined up in advance, especially if they live in rural parts of the country, said Sue Gainor, national chair of Families for Russian and Ukrainian Adoption, a volunteer-led nonprofit that offers support and community. Gainor, who adopted a son from Moscow in 2001, said there are between 600,000 and 800,000 orphans in Russia, with an additional 80,000 to 100,000 in hospitals awaiting placement in orphanages. ""When you slow adoptions, you affect a lot of children,"" she said. ""There's lots of angst in the adoption community. The minute you see the picture of that prospective child, that kid is yours."" Being a parent, child advocates and members of the adoption community add, means helping a child adjust to change and work through challenges. ""This is just so sad because that kid had no chance whatsoever,"" said Larisa Mason, who directs a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, adoption agency and serves on the board of the National Council for Adoption. ""A 7-year-old who changed his whole life within six months -- new language, new food, a new mother -- no question he would have issues. Even a dog would have issues."" In addition to hoping adoptions continue uninterrupted, many also want Hansen punished for her actions. Natasha Shaginian-Needham is the founder and director of Happy Families International Center in Cold Spring, New York. The agency, established in 1992, helps orphans with special needs (including Valera), with adoptions being part of its work. ""The mother who finds somebody on the Internet, who sold his services for $200 in order to pick up and deliver [him] ... in Russia, demonstrates serious neglect and abandonment,"" she said. ""There was a very high risk that the child could have been met by a pedophile or worse, a killer. The community in Russia is outraged by the fact that the mother may not be punished at all for her inhuman action."" Prospective adoptive mothers like Andrea Wright of Wake Forest, North Carolina, hope she, her husband, Kenneth, and the boy they want to adopt aren't punished because of Hansen's actions. Leaving St. Petersburg, Russia, on Friday, Wright was overwhelmed with joy and anticipation. The 40-year-old fundraiser and her husband had just spent a week bonding with a little boy they are on track to soon call their own. The hopeful first-time parents arrived armed with toys to engage little Andrei, who will turn 1 later this month. In awe and with hearts melting, they watched as the child teetered into the room, clasping the hands of an orphanage caregiver. Of all the toys they brought him, stacking balls and cars included, his favorite item: Cheerios. Though he was a little reluctant at first, he warmed up during their stay. When they left him, he waved his arms to say goodbye. In six to eight weeks, they have plans to return to Russia to appear in court, the next phase in their journey to become parents. ""We've been working on the process for close to a year. It's been one procedural thing after another. ... We are so prepared to be parents and have worked so hard to get to this point,"" she said. ""We're hoping that since we've been to Russia once that we'll be allowed to continue. We're trying to go with a lot of faith and prayers at this point that it'll all work out.""","About 3,000 American families are in the process of adopting from Russia .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Nearly 150,000 homes were without drinking water Monday after the worst floodwaters in 60 years swamped large areas of western England. Flooding has caused widespread disruption across the country with further regions braced for more floods. British military and rescue workers battled to save a major electricity substation on the outskirts of Gloucester, England, that serves about 500,000 homes. About 1,000 Royal Navy personnel were building an emergency barrier to keep the Walham substation from flooding. Their efforts have been successful so far, the Gloucestershire Constabulary Emergency Services said Monday evening. Some 50,000 homes were already without electricity before the substation was threatened. Two major rivers -- the Thames and the Severn -- are well above their normal levels and may burst their banks, according to authorities.  Watch as Britons brace for more flooding » . Britain's Environment Agency warned water levels could rise further to a ""critical level"" and issued nine severe flood warnings across the country. The worst affected areas are the counties of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Oxfordshire, which had more than 5 inches (12.5 cm) of rain in barely 24 hours. More rain is forecast, and the risk of flooding is increasing as floodwaters work their way into the river system. In the historic city of Gloucester, the River Severn is expected to burst its banks later Monday. The river is already nearly 15 feet (5 meters) above its normal level for this time of year and close to breaching its banks.  See residents walk through flooded streets and homes » . Electricity and water supplies in and around the city are already cut to many residents, after a water treatment plant and electricity sub-station were flooded. The city of Tewkesbury is also flooded -- video from the area showed dozens of cars and homes under several feet of water. Officials said it would be at least 48 hours before they could gain access to the Mythe Water Pumping Station in Tewkesbury to return water supply to 70,000 customers in Tewkesbury, Gloucester and Cheltenham. ""There is no doubt this unprecedented situation has been testing for each and every one of the emergency services and our partner agencies,"" said Gloucestershire Chief Constable Timothy Brain. ""I must pay tribute to the marathon effort being made to prevent the situation from worsening and to support those affected by the flooding, loss of power, loss of water and other consequences of this extreme situation,"" he said. Hundreds of people in the worst affected areas have been plucked to safety by helicopters of the Royal Air Force and boats. Further north in Evesham, the River Severn is more than twice its normal width. So far this month England has had nearly two-and-a-half-times its normal rainfall. Prime Minister Gordon Brown visited Gloucester -- and promised to mobilize resources from across the country. He also announced increased funding for flood and coastal defenses across the country. ""Like every advanced industrialized country, we are coming to terms with the issues surrounding climate change,"" he said. The prime minister described the flooding as unprecedented, and brushed aside criticism of his government for the quality of flood defenses and a slow response to the crisis. ""I think the emergency services have done a great job,"" he said. ""I am satisfied people are doing everything they can."" The wet weather for much of June and July across England and Wales has also affected crops. Farmers are predicting low yields and higher prices -- with several crops due to be harvested in the next month. Insurance companies are expecting claims worth hundreds of millions of dollars because of flood damage. More than 2,000 people spent Sunday night in emergency accommodation and the Royal Air Force and coastguard helicopters airlifted hundreds to safety in one of Britain's largest peacetime rescue operations. ""I'm afraid to say that I don't think we have seen the peak yet,"" John Harman, of the Environment Agency, told BBC radio. ""All this water that we have seen ... is now into the river system. Even though the rain has eased off a bit ... it's the water in the rivers now that constitutes a threat."" E-mail to a friend .","Flood waters in parts of England at 60-year highs .

"(CNN) -- Democrats increased their 36-seat majority in the U.S. House, according to CNN projections, by defeating established Republicans and winning open seats as they capitalized on an unpopular GOP president. Rep. Chris Shays, R-Connecticut, failed to win his 11th full term. Democrats clinched a majority and took at least 21 seats from Republicans, with the GOP taking only four from the Democrats, according to CNN projections as of 4 a.m. ET Wednesday. With winners yet to be called for 11 of the House's 435 seats, Democrats were projected to win 251 seats, with Republicans having 173. Heading into Election Day, the Democrats had a 235-199 majority. The Democrats' apparent gains Tuesday come two years after they took control of the House -- with a gain of 30 seats -- after 12 years in the minority. Among Tuesday's GOP casualties was longtime Rep. Chris Shays of Connecticut, whose reputation for occasionally bucking his party couldn't keep him from losing to Democrat Jim Himes. Shays' defeat leaves New England without any Republicans in the House. Shays was seeking his 11th full term. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said Tuesday night she was confident Democrats would ride a ""wave"" of pro-Democratic sentiment across the country and add to their House majority, though she declined to predict by how much. Watch Pelosi say Americans voted for change . ""We have surfers to ride that wave,"" Pelosi said at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, where she was watching election results. Here are highlights of other races with projected winners: . • Democrats gained at least two seats in Ohio, including that of Rep. Steve Chabot, who was seeking an eighth term in a Cincinnati-area district that normally votes about evenly for GOP and Democratic presidential candidates. CNN projects that Chabot lost to Democrat Steve Driehaus. Just two years earlier, Chabot was re-elected with 52 percent of the vote despite an anti-Republican tide that helped Democrats capture Ohio's governorship and take a U.S. Senate seat. Democrats also gained a seat left open by retiring Rep. Ralph Regula. Democrat John Boccieri defeated the GOP's Kirk Schuring in the northeastern Ohio contest. • In New York, Democrats won three Republican seats, including two left open by incumbents not seeking re-election. In one of the open races, Democrat Mike McMahon won the last GOP-held seat in New York City, defeating the GOP's Robert Straniere. Democrat Dan Maffei defeated Republican Dale Sweetland, who was trying to win a seat vacated by 10-term GOP Rep. Jim Walsh. In a rematch of a 2006 race, former naval officer Eric Massa beat GOP Rep. Randy Kuhl in a western New York district that generally votes Republican. • Freshman Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, was projected to survive a race that tightened after she made comments about Sen. Barack Obama last month. She was leading Democratic challenger Elwyn Tinklenberg 47 percent to 43 percent with 86 percent of precincts reporting. Bachmann set off a storm of criticism in October when she said Obama's connection to 1960s radical William Ayers made her concerned that Obama may have anti-American views. Bachmann's comments prompted a flood of fundraising for Tinklenberg. • In Florida, Democrats captured from Republicans two of the four seats that analysts thought they could win. Democrat Suzanne Kosmas defeated Rep. Tom Fenney, and Democrat Alan Grayson defeated Rep. Ric Keller. However, brothers and Republicans Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Mario Diaz-Balart, who represent districts in southern Florida, held off their Democratic challengers. Lincoln Diaz-Balart won a ninth term, defeating former Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez. • Democratic incumbents weren't invulnerable in Florida. Rep. Tim Mahoney -- a south-central Florida Democrat elected to replace scandal-plagued GOP Rep. Mark Foley in 2006 -- lost to his Republican challenger, Tom Rooney. Mahoney already was going to have a tough race in his Republican-leaning district. But the race became tougher in mid-October with allegations that Mahoney had an affair with one of his aides and paid her thousands of dollars in hush money. Mahoney admitted to causing ""pain"" in his marriage, but he denied paying the aide to keep quiet. • In Pennsylvania, Rep. John Murtha handily defeated Republican challenger William Russell. Republicans had hoped to defeat Murtha after he called his western Pennsylvania district ""a racist area"" and ""redneck.""    • The House's third-ranking Republican, Rep. Adam Putnam of central Florida, was re-elected but wrote to his colleagues Tuesday night that he wouldn't run again for a leadership post, saying he wanted to return his focus ""to crafting public policy solutions for America's generational challenges."" He is currently the GOP conference chairman. • In a heavily Republican district near Houston, Texas, Democratic Rep. Nick Lampson lost his re-election bid against Pete Olson. Lampson won the seat in 2006 after Republican and former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay resigned to fight state money laundering charges. • In Ohio's 11th District, Democrats easily took a seat that was vacant since the death of Democratic Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones. Democrat Marcia Fudge defeated Republican Thomas Pekarek. Tubbs Jones, who represented the district that covers parts of Cleveland and its suburbs, died in August after brain hemorrhaging caused by an aneurysm. • The House's first two Muslim members, Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Rep. Andre Carson of Indiana, won their contests Tuesday. Carson has won his first full term; he had succeeded his grandmother, the late Rep. Julia Carson, in a March special election. Not all 435 seats will be decided immediately. Two Louisiana districts used Election Day for primary run-offs; the general election for those seats will be December 6.","Projections: House Dems take at least 21 GOP seats; Republicans snatch four .

"(CNN) -- Investigators released photographs Wednesday showing a man wanted in the case of a slain woman and her missing 7-year-old daughter. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation released images taken by a security camera of 37-year-old Tonya Hobbs and her estranged husband, Lester Williams Hobbs, as they shopped for food just hours before Tonya Hobbs was killed. Police have charged Lester Hobbs with murder in his estranged wife's death. They also have charged him with kidnapping Tonya Hobbs' daughter, Aja Daniell Johnson, the bureau said Wednesday. ""These new pictures show the suspect car that is now missing as well as what the suspect, Lester Hobbs, looks like and the clothes he may be wearing now,"" a bureau spokeswoman, Jessica Brown, said in a statement. Investigators have asked anyone with information about Hobbs or Aja to call a new hotline number at 1-800-THE-LOST. The images released Wednesday were taken about 5:15 p.m. Saturday at a store in Lawton, Oklahoma. Shortly after that, the couple and Aja apparently went to the home of Lester Hobbs' sister to eat, police said. Hobbs was found dead in a parked RV the next day in Geronimo, Oklahoma. Her daughter has been missing since then. ""We've got to find that little girl,"" Special Agent Ray Homer of the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said this week. The girl has a medical condition that requires medication, police have said, though they declined to elaborate. Lester Hobbs, 46, and Aja are presumed to be in Hobbs' car -- a white 1992 Toyota Paseo with an Oklahoma tag number 577-BPW, police said. Police have searched for them in Oklahoma and Texas. Lester and Tonya Hobbs were separated, but apparently Tonya Hobbs was visiting her estranged husband in an attempt to reconcile, Richard Goss, agent in charge of the state bureau of investigation's Lawton, Oklahoma, office, told reporters this week. Lester Hobbs is not Aja's biological father, police said. He has an extensive criminal history, Goss said, without elaborating. Aja's biological father was awarded emergency custody of her in November, according to Oklahoma County District Court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KWTV of Oklahoma City. At a hearing, Tonya Hobbs -- identified as Tonya Dunkin in the documents -- and the girl's father, John Johnson, agreed that she would have supervised visitation with Aja and keep the girl away from Lester Hobbs, the documents said.","Store security photo shows Lester and Tonya Hobbs before her death .

"(CNN) -- Search efforts turned into a recovery operation Monday for a U.S. Navy instructor pilot presumed dead after his plane crashed into Lake Pontchartrain, just outside of New Orleans, Louisiana, during a routine training mission, a Navy spokesman said. The student pilot on the plane was rescued about two hours after the crash Saturday night and taken to a hospital for mild hypothermia and moderate injuries, according to the Navy. He has since been released. The missing instructor pilot has been identified as Lt. Clinton Wermers, 33, of Mitchell, South Dakota. The Navy did not identify the rescued student pilot. The two pilots were attached to Training Squadron 6 at Naval Air Station Whiting Field in Milton, Florida. Initial reports were that both the pilots were clinging to the aircraft before it sank, according to the U.S. Coast Guard, which is assisting in the search. Lt. Brett Dawson, a Navy air training spokesman, told CNN Monday that the wreckage of the plane has been located and a salvage unit will be working to recover it. The cause of the crash is under investigation, Dawson said. Air traffic controllers at Lakefront Airport in New Orleans notified the Coast Guard at 6:40 p.m. Saturday that a U.S. Navy T-34 training plane was no longer visible on radar, the Coast Guard said in a news release. The plane had been approaching the airport during a routine nighttime instrument training mission, the Navy said. The T-34 is a single-engine, single-prop plane used for primary training for student pilots. It does not have an ejection mechanism, Dawson said. Instead, pilots can open the canopy, slide it back and roll out of the aircraft. At the time of the crash, the temperature was 50 degrees Fahrenheit with calm winds, the Coast Guard said. The water temperature was 52 degrees. CNN's Sarah Aarthun and Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","Search efforts turned into a recovery operation Monday after T-34 crashed Saturday night .

"(CNN) -- Gay and lesbian groups are attacking a decision by the archdiocese of Denver, Colorado, not to re-enroll a child in a Catholic school in Boulder, Colorado, next year because the child's parents are lesbians. The issue centers on the Sacred Heart of Jesus School, where the pre-schooler is currently enrolled. ""The Archdiocese of Denver has acted very unjustly in singling out this child for exclusion,"" said DignityUSA Executive Director Marianne Duddy-Burke in a written statement Monday. ""Until every student's parents are tested on Catholic teaching, this action by Catholic officials cannot be understood as anything other than discrimination on the back of a child. At a tender age, this child has learned that Catholic officials are willing to inflict pain on children and families."" The decision was made public last week. ""These actions by the Denver Archdiocese harm the student by taking the child away from friends, teachers and community,"" said Jarrett Barrios, president of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. ""It's deeply troubling to see any school remove a child from their educational program simply as the means of rejecting that child's parents."" But the archdiocese defended its decision. ""Parents living in open discord with Catholic teaching in areas of faith and morals unfortunately choose by their actions to disqualify their children from enrollment,"" it said in a statement posted on its Web site. ""To allow children in these circumstances to continue in our school would be a cause of confusion for the student in that what they are being taught in school conflicts with what they experience in the home. ""We communicated the policy to the couple at Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic School as soon as we realized the situation. We discussed the reasons with them and have sought to respond in a way that does not abruptly displace the student but at the same time respects the integrity of the Catholic school's philosophy."" In a posting of his sermon, the Rev. Bill Breslin, pastor of Sacred Heart of Jesus Church, supported the move. ""The issue is not about our not accepting 'sinners,' "" he said. ""It is not about punishing the child for the sins of his or her parents. It is simply that the lesbian couple is saying that their relationship is a good one that should be accepted by everyone; and the Church cannot agree to that."" About 30 opponents of the move -- ""mostly hetero allies of the gay community"" -- protested Sunday outside the church during Mass, said Dave Ensign, board president of Boulder Pride, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community center and services organization. Ensign handed out flyers to the protesters and then joined the parishioners as they listened to the sermon defending the church's move. ""I was disappointed, but it was pretty much what I was expecting to hear,"" he said. He added that the larger community's reaction has been positive, saying, ""When people hear about this, they speak up, and I think that says a lot about our community."" The child has not been identified publicly. No one at the archdiocese or at the school immediately returned calls Monday seeking comment.","Gay and lesbian groups call the decision ""discrimination on the back of a child""

"(CNN) -- The tone of tweets on Twitter and posts on Facebook in reaction to President Obama's State of the Union speech Wednesday night were in contrast to the optimistic comments on his speeches to Congress in September and during his inauguration. Social media users showed more frustration compared with the more hopeful tones in the past, with many saying they hoped the president's rhetoric would lead to more action. Their frustrations with the lingering economic doldrums, high jobless rates and the battle over health care are reflected in Obama's approval ratings. They have dropped from 76 percent to 49 percent since February. Social media comments echoed those sentiments. Some users, including members of Congress, continued to find hope in Obama's words, which they said moved them to believe the country can turn around. Others saw the speech as simply political rhetoric and sometimes contradictory. CNN.com monitored Facebook posts and tweets during Obama's speech.

"(CNN) -- Moussa Dadis Camara, the military leader of the West African nation of Guinea, was shot and wounded in an attack on his presidential convoy, an official said. His ""life is not in any danger,"" said the regime's minister of state for presidential affairs, Maj. Keletigui Faro. ""The situation is under control."" The attack occurred on Thursday in Conakry, the nation's capital, Faro said. It comes after increased pressure internally and internationally for Camara to hold, but not be a candidate in, elections in January. Camara, who seized power in a coup in December 2008, has given no indication that he will follow through with the elections. In September an opposition demonstration was marred by violence, as the military fired on people gathered in the capital's national stadium. Human rights groups say at least 157 people were killed and many women were raped. The military continues to crack down on opposition in the country, Amnesty International said in a newly released report. ""A climate of fear continues in Guinea,"" said the organization's Gaetan Mootoo. ""The authorities can no longer turn a blind eye to the human rights violations committed by its security forces.""","Attack occurs Thursday in the nation's capital, Conakry, official says .

"(CNN) -- Marin Cilic sealed his place in the third round of the Monte Carlo Rolex Masters after a hard-fought win over Igor Andreev of Russia on Tuesday. The fourth seed eventually dispatched Andreev 6-7 (4-7) 6-1 6-4 but it took the Croatian nearly three hours to do so. Cilic, appearing in his first clay-court match for 10 months, started slowly and allowed the Russian to dominate the early exchanges and clinch the first set on a tie-break. But Cilic regained his momentum in the second set, offering up just one game as he marched to a 6-1 success. And though Cilic twice went a break down in the deciding set, he held on to claim it 6-4 and progress to round three. ""The conditions were tough, the balls were heavy,"" Cilic told the official ATP Tour Web site. ""I just wanted to stay in it after losing that first set by making him play a lot of shots. Afterwards I found some solutions so I could win easier points and win the mental battle."" Cilic was joined in round three by French fifth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Spanish sixth seed Fernando Verdasco, who both recorded straight-sets victories. Verdasco breezed past Frenchman Julien Benneteau 6-2 6-1 in just under 75 minutes, while Tsonga defeated Nicolas Almagro of Spain 7-6 (7-5) 7-5. Tomas Berdych set up a third-round match with Verdasco after beating Richard Gasquet of France in straight sets. The Czech 10th seed took less than an hour to record a 6-2 6-0 victory. The top names in the field -- world No. 2 Novak Djokovic, five-time champion Rafael Nadal and third seed Andy Murray -- begin their campaigns on Wednesday after being handed a first-round bye. Nadal beat Britain's Murray in last year's semifinals before going on to defeat Serbian Djokovic to claim the title.

Dr. Conrad Murray, Jackson's personal physician when he died last summer, had planned to surrender to authorities Friday afternoon at the Los Angeles courthouse branch near Los Angeles International Airport, but that changed when prosecutors delayed filing charges. Murray's lawyer, Ed Chernoff, then told reporters he and Murray would instead be in a public park near the courthouse Friday afternoon to talk about the case. That event was soon canceled. ""In light of the district attorney's office announcement that Dr. Murray will be charged on Monday, we have canceled media access until after arraignment,"" Chernoff said in a written statement. Murray's lawyers and prosecutors had been negotiating Thursday to have Murray turn himself in, but those negotiations broke down, a law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the talks told Beth Karas of ""In Session,"" on CNN sister network truTV. ""I don't know what part of negotiations could have broken down, in light of the fact that we've placed ourselves in the hands of law enforcement to surrender at any time,"" said Ed Chernoff, Murray's lawyer. Los Angeles prosecutors could file charges at any time, however, setting up a scenario for Los Angeles police to find Murray on their own, arrest him and take him to jail. A surrender -- in which a defendant turns himself in at a police station for booking -- would allow the doctor to avoid being seen in public handcuffed and escorted by police. Chernoff said earlier Thursday that he and Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney David Walgren ""share the goal of the efficient administration of this process."" ""An arrest of Dr. Murray would be a waste of money, time and resources,"" Chernoff said. ""We've always made it clear: You tell us where; we'll be there. I'm sure something can be arranged."" The doctor traveled to Los Angeles last week from his home in Houston, Texas, in expectation of possible charges. Murray was hired last spring as Jackson prepared for his comeback concerts in London, England. The doctor told Los Angeles police that he was with Jackson through the early morning hours of June 25 in an effort to help the pop star fall asleep, according to a police affidavit. He administered sleep aids, and after Jackson finally began sleeping in the late morning hours, Murray said, he left the bedroom for ""about two minutes maximum,"" the affidavit said. ""Upon his return, Murray noticed that Jackson was no longer breathing,"" it said. The doctor stayed with Jackson as an ambulance rushed him from his $100,000-a-month rented mansion in Holmby Hills to UCLA Medical Center. Efforts at CPR proved fruitless, and Jackson was pronounced dead at 2:26 p.m. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled Jackson's death a homicide resulting from a combination of drugs, primarily propofol and lorazepam. The coroner's statement said Jackson died from ""acute propofol intoxication,"" but there were ""other conditions contributing to death: benzodiazepine effect."" Lorazepam and two other drugs Murray said he used are benzodiazepines. The doctor told investigators he had given Jackson three anti-anxiety drugs to help him sleep in the hours before he stopped breathing, a police affidavit said. Murray had been treating Jackson for insomnia for six weeks at the time of the singer's death. The doctor told investigators he gave Jackson 50 milligrams of propofol, the generic name for Diprivan, diluted with the anesthetic lidocaine every night via an intravenous drip. The doctor told police he was worried that Jackson was becoming addicted to the drug and tried to wean him off it. During the two nights before Jackson's death, Murray said, he put together combinations of other drugs that succeeded in helping Jackson sleep. CNN's Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.","NEW: Dr. Conrad Murray, lawyer cancel press conference about case in Los Angeles park .

"Washington (CNN) -- The weirdest campaign ad of this season -- maybe any season -- debuted on the Internet this past week. The ad has been nicknamed, ""Demon Sheep,"" and can be viewed here. The ad is an opening salvo in what will could prove the most expensive Senate race in U.S. history. The incumbent, Barbara Boxer, has always been the less popular of California's two Democratic senators. Boxer now looks vulnerable. Two Republicans declared early for the nomination against Boxer: state Sen. Chuck DeVore and former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. Fiorina took an early lead. But her performance on the campaign trail disheartened many of her supporters. Worse, Fiorina never developed a good answer to the questions about her business career. Portfolio magazine had dubbed Fiorina one of the 20 worst CEOs of all time after a disastrous merger with Compaq. Fiorina was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year. She herself walked away with a payday estimated as high as $40 million. That history was tough to explain to hard-pressed voters. Facing an intensifying risk of self-inflicted defeat in a winnable race, party leaders and donors enticed former state budget director Tom Campbell into the race. Campbell immediately stepped into first place in the polls, five points ahead of Fiorina, 15 ahead of DeVore. The ""demon sheep"" ad was Fiorina's attempt to head Campbell off at the pass. No description can do justice to the ad's low-budget strangeness. The ad presents Campbell as a dangerous predator with glowing red eyes, preying upon Fiorina's flock. Never mind that it's not usually smart tactics to represent the voters as dim-witted sheep. The more urgent question for California Republicans is this: What should they make of the substance of Fiorina's attack on Campbell? Here's the former front-runner's case: . Campbell presents himself as a committed fiscal conservative. In fact, however, he's a career politician largely responsible for the state's budget crisis. He helped write the 2005 California budget, which contained a big jump in state spending. He called for raising the gas tax and for sales taxes on Internet purchases. And he refused to sign the famous no-tax-increase pledge presented to all candidates by the Washington lobbying group, Americans for Tax Reform. He's not the pure-hearted fiscal conservative admired by his backers: Instead Campbell is ""Taxing Tom,"" a ""FCINO"": fiscal conservative in name only. What's the truth? To anyone familiar with the Campbell record, it seems crazy that anybody would charge him with insufficient commitment to free-market causes. Campbell wrote an economics dissertation under Milton Friedman at the University of Chicago. He ran the competition bureau at the Federal Trade Commission during the Reagan administration. Elected to Congress from Palo Alto, California, in 1988, re-elected four times, he amassed one of the most taxpayer-friendly voting records in the House of Representatives. That was the record that inspired California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to hire Campbell as state budget director in 2005. California's budget position was already desperate when Campbell took the job. • The teachers' union had pushed through a ballot measure that directed 40 percent of all state spending to schools -- meaning every time Medicaid spending rose, the schools got a raise too. • California's ""three-strikes"" law -- life in prison after a third felony conviction -- had filled the state's correctional institutions with doddering old crooks confined forever at taxpayer expense. • Reckless union contracts had pushed public-sector pay and benefits to astounding heights: over $100,000 for some prison guards. • Illegal immigration played havoc with state finances. Illegal immigrants paid very little tax, but imposed as much on the state's roads, hospitals, schools, and prisons as anybody else. Gov. Schwarzenegger and director Campbell tried to address these constitutionally imposed dysfunctions in a 2005 ballot measure. The initiative would have enhanced the governor's powers to cut spending growth, nullified the 40 percent guarantee to schools, and imposed across the board spending cuts if spending outpaced revenues. The measure, Proposition 76, was California's last clear chance to avert the state's present budget crisis. It was rejected. California has now plunged into the crisis that Schwarzenegger and Campbell foresaw and attempted to forestall. California is constitutionally required to balance its budget. Without the powers contained in Prop 76, Schwarzenegger and Campbell had to make the best deal they could with the state's interest-group dominated Democratic legislature. Under those awful circumstances, an increase in the gas tax was among the state's least bad alternatives. Campbell responsibly and courageously endorsed it, just as a surgeon operates on a heart patient who had earlier rejected advice to reduce his cholesterol. Fiorina's ad poses a powerful question. What does it mean to be a fiscal conservative? Fiorina criticizes Campbell for declining to sign a no-tax-increase pledge. Of course, Republicans have been enthusiastically signing that pledge for almost two decades now. The pledge did not stop them from spending money profusely. In fact it has turned out that a no-tax pledge can actually incentivize spending, by creating a ready-made excuse for the ensuing deficits. Fiorina's ad asks an apt question: What does it mean to be a fiscal conservative in the midst of the worst deficits and debts since World War II? Here are the tests I'd be considering if I were a California voter: . • What's your record of controlling government spending? • What are your specific plans for controlling spending in future? • In particular, how will you restrain the growth of Medicare and Medicaid -- the two main drivers of federal spending? A candidate who can answer those questions with credibility can claim to be a fiscal conservative in something more than name. A candidate who offers only a pledge not to increase taxes to pay for the spending for which he or she votes? That candidate is just another Republican sheep. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","Carly Fiorina released the ""demon sheep"" ad in California race for U.S. Senate .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It's 2020. You get home from work, kick off your shoes and relax -- on your very own tropical island. That night, your friends teleport over with other glamorous guests, all nipped, tucked and primped to perfection, for a hedonistic cocktail party at your five-star beach house, decked out in expensively understated chrome, crystal and fine Italian furniture. Experts say the use of virtual worlds like Second Life may be widespread by 2020 . But this is no billionaire way of life. If virtual worlds become the next Facebook phenomenon, experts predict that logging on to a luxury lifestyle could be attainable for all of us -- and we might even spend more money on our online homes than on our real-life surroundings. With over 30 million users worldwide, 8.5 million photos uploaded each day and 15 billion page views a month, Facebook is undoubtedly the Internet's flavor of the month. But by 2020, virtual worlds may have surpassed social networking sites as the place to spend time online. Experts believe that the draw of 3-D spaces where our avatars can hang out with our friends -- and meet new ones -- may tempt away even the most ardent Facebook addict. David Knighton, a 35-year-old Second Life user from Jacksonville, Florida, is one of many netizens exploring virtual worlds. He's been visiting the site for over a year and told CNN that he enjoys its social dimension. ""I've met several good friends in Second Life, who are still friends to this day in the 'real world'"" he said. At times, David has spent six hours a day, seven days a week on Second Life. But what is the draw of a virtual world? Are they only attractive to tech-heads? David doesn't think so. He says, ""Experience plays a role in acceptance to be sure, but Second Life takes hold more on a social and creative level. Someone who signs in and recognizes those aspects of Second Life will immediately be hooked."" This is backed up by blogger and writer Caleb Booker, who has tracked virtual worlds from phone ""party lines"" through the first one-player text-based computer adventures to the two- and three-dimensional Internet worlds that are burgeoning today. Booker believes that, in a society that's increasingly mobile, virtual worlds help us hold our far-flung social networks together. He cites the example of his mother-in-law, who recently moved to a new city and uses Facebook to stay in touch with her three daughters. ""They're all busy, so virtual world technologies and Web 2.0 apps are the best and most convenient ways to keep up,"" he told CNN. Booker says that virtual worlds take this interaction to a more sophisticated level. ""I don't even have to worry about cab fare if I want to have a little get-together with my friends from the UK and the US tonight,"" he said. And he thinks that it's only a matter of time before virtual worlds follow Facebook and explode in popularity. ""Bottom line: if people are using email for social interaction, they'll probably be interested in other ways to be social online."" Life-like avatars . Interaction on Facebook, MySpace and other social networking sites is mainly limited to text, with the ability for users to add photos and video. But in a virtual world, people are represented by avatars: computer-generated figures which can look uncannily like ourselves -- if we choose. They can walk like us, they'll soon talk like us and they can interact with each other. As 3-D technology becomes increasingly sophisticated, Booker says that photo-realistic avatars are just around the corner, and will become increasingly convincing. ""Eye movement, breathing, and realistic expressions will be the easy part,"" he revealed. ""The hard part will come with things like synching mouth movements with voice recognition. That's something we might not quite have nailed by 2020, but there will definitely be some kind of engine that attempts it by then."" Holographic projections of 3-D objects are in development, but it will be some time before virtual reality offers us experiences akin to Star Trek's holodecks: touching and tasting virtual matter is still some way off. ""We're a long, long way away from having a completely immersive Matrix-like world,"" he told CNN. ""But then again, technology can surprise you. I remember joking with a friend about a guy who bought a brand-new VGA monitor. It could display 256 colors at once -- who could honestly need something like that?"" Spartan life offline, exotic life online . The authors of the ""Metaverse Roadmap,"" a briefing document that explores the possible development of virtual worlds over the next 20 years, agree that a boom within a decade is likely. Their research has indicated that by 2016, half of us will have interactive avatars, with those aged between 13 and 30 spending around 10 hours a week socializing in 3-D visual environments. And the draw of virtual worlds may encourage some of us to forsake our mundane real-life surroundings for a luxury life online. The Metaverse Roadmap points to the millions of youths who already use worlds like Habbo Hotel and Playdo, and suggests that ""Youth raised in such conditions might live increasingly Spartan lives in the physical world, and rich, exotic lives in virtual space."" It makes a certain kind of sense: why cripple yourself with huge mortgage payments on ""real"" real-estate when on Second Life you can buy an entire island for $1,600 and $300/month maintenance? The uses for virtual worlds don't stop at socializing. Virtual environments are already being built for education, like Edward Castronova's ""Arden"" project at Indiana University, which will transport users into a Shakespearean world. The applications for interior designers are clear, while a team at the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in Bethesda, Maryland have used the virtual shoot-em-up ""Duke Nukem"" to diagnose depression in players. Business collaboration . Booker believes that virtual worlds will be used increasingly as business tools. ""They're very well suited to collaborative work,"" he explained. ""We're not sure why yet, but there's something about seeing everybody's avatar in the room with yours that makes the whole experience far more effective than if you were to simply have a conference call. It creates a real shared experience."" And with the launch of Sony's PlayStation Home -- an online world for the games console -- this autumn, it seems the big players in the entertainment world are banking on virtual realms being part of the future, too. ""The common feeling is that by 2020 virtual worlds will be as widespread as the World Wide Web is now,"" states Booker. With that popularity comes opportunity -- and not only for Internet land barons like self-proclaimed Second Life millionaire Anshe Chung, but also virtual builders, landscapers and interior decorators, designers of avatar clothing and accessories, and even community moderators and governors. ""A significant percentage of the world's population will be able to make a living working in virtual worlds,"" says Booker. And he thinks that this potential is just around the corner. ""The truth is that, as far as virtual worlds go, we're living in the flash point at the beginning of the explosion."" ........................ What future do you think virtual worlds hold?

"(CNN) -- When J.R. Martinez returned from serving in Iraq, he never thought he'd see his name on the marquee at the local restaurant -- but there it was, a welcome-home banner at the Applebee's in Dalton, Georgia. More than 40 percent of J.R. Martinez's body was burned in a land mine explosion in Iraq. He certainly never imagined he'd be starring in a popular daytime soap opera, either. But Martinez, 25, has never let the severe burns he received while serving in the United States Army stop him. He spoke with CNN's Nicole Lapin about overcoming odds and being an inspiration for young people.  Watch Nicole Lapin interview J.R. Martinez » . The following is an edited transcript of the interview. Nicole Lapin: You told your mom you'd come back in one piece. You're obviously back in one piece. You came back burned. What happened? J.R. Martinez: Well, April 5, 2003, I was driving a Humvee through a city called Karbala in Iraq. My job in the military -- in the Army -- was infantry, and as we were driving, my front left tire hit a land mine and I was trapped inside the vehicle. The other three guys, the other three soldiers walked away with minor injuries, which I'm thankful for every single day. I was trapped inside the vehicle for about ten minutes, conscious and can literally see my life slipping away from me. You know, my mother is my best friend and I kind of had the visual of my mother, and them handing her a flag and I thought to myself, that's not something I want to put my mother through. So it's one of those things where we don't know how strong we are until we're faced with things in life and I got through it. Lapin: You did. [A viewer] has a question for you about what kept you going. She says, ""First of all, I want to sincerely say thank you for defending our freedom. My question is, during the time of the explosion, how did you keep yourself going?"" Martinez: Well, when I was a young child, one of my sisters passed away from an illness she was born with. She was born in Central America and I was born here in the United States and I never met her, but I always felt the connection throughout my whole childhood. I felt the connection with my sister and I was confused as to why. And the day of my injury when I was inside the vehicle and I can literally see my life slipping away, an actual visual of my sister came to me and told me I was going to be OK and told me I'd be fine. And after that sweet whisper went away, they pulled me out of the vehicle and got me immediately into the medical team's hands. So I guess you could say faith, my sister, my mother -- all the things that kind of kept me grounded as a young child that my mother instilled in me at a young age: to be strong and to hold on to certain things in life because they'll get you through. Like I said, it's something that's hard to explain, but I know a lot of guys that have been injured in the military or people that have been injured outside the military in the civilian world. And I am just like, ""How did you make it?"" It's just like, we don't know, we just hang in there. Lapin: You just do it. Martinez: Yeah, you just do it. All of us had it inside us. We just don't know it until we're faced with it and that's when the true strength really shows. Lapin: Well, you went through 32 surgeries over 34 months. Was there ever a time where you said, ""Woe is me""? Martinez: Yeah, I'm definitely human and there are a lot of bad days. Even being in the soap opera world, there are still days where you wake up and you're like, ""Here we go again."" Another obstacle [is] where I have to go into the public and show my face and catch those looks of people here in New York. It's one of those things where you've just got to get through it, and you've got to fight the obstacles and you've got to be strong and you say, ""You know what? I have hope and I believe and I'm never going to quit."" And if you do those things, you'll be surprised where your life can take you because, as I said in one of the interviews I did, only in America where this can happen, you can go from losing your life to now being on a soap opera. Lapin: We're looking at a picture of you in a soap opera right now, ""All My Children."" J.R., sitting in that hospital bed watching soap operas with your mother, did you ever think you'd actually be in one? Martinez: You know, it's funny. You've got to be careful what you wish for in life. When I was in the hospital I couldn't move. I couldn't do anything. I was basically at the hands of medical staff and my mother, and every night my mother would watch novela, the Spanish soap opera. And there wasn't nothing I could do about it. So I just sat there. And finally I just got to a point where I'm just going to take it in and watch TV with her. And one day out of a joke I said, ""One day I'm going to be on a soap opera, mom."" All through my recovery I started to do motivational speaking. I became a spokesman for a non-profit called the Coalition to Salute America's Heroes, which helps wounded troops who return from Iraq and Afghanistan. And I always thought to myself, ""In the midst of all this, I would maybe love to touch that world some day, just to kind of play with it for a little bit."" And here I am. Lapin: So you had a little premonition. Martinez: Yeah, so you've got to be careful what you wish for in life because you never know what can happen. Now, in the role in ""All My Children,"" it's a veteran who falls in love and because of his disfigurement, he doesn't know if that person is going to accept him. He kind of feels that it's best for her to move on with her life and not to be a part of his and his struggle. Lapin: [Another viewer] has a question. He wants to know, ""Your story is amazing. I wanted to ask you if it has been tough to relive the terrible pain of your real life during your filming of 'All My Children'?"" Martinez: A lot of us, we go through things in life sometimes and we don't want to sit there and go back to remember it, but it's good to go back and remember it and it's good to talk about it, whether it's to yourself or a piece of paper or whether it's to an audience or a camera like I am doing right now.","J.R.

"Washington (CNN)  -- Five men missing from the Washington area are in Pakistani police custody, the FBI said Thursday, a day after Pakistani authorities arrested several men whom they described as Americans and accused them of plotting terrorist attacks. In a statement, the FBI said Pakistani authorities detained the men -- four of whom it said were found to have American passports -- on Wednesday, ""after they came to the attention of police."" The statement did not give further details and did not identify the men. ""Although positive identification is still pending, the FBI believes they are the missing individuals,"" the bureau said. An FBI special agent and two other U.S. government officials from the U.S. Embassy have spoken with some of the men, the FBI said. Pakistani police said they are confident the men were planning terrorist acts, according to Tahir Gujjar, deputy superintendent of police in Sargodha, where the men were arrested. Gujjar told CNN that a preliminary investigation suggests that the men came to Pakistan to wage jihad and had sought to link up with the Jaish-e-Mohammed and Jamaat ud Dawa militant organizations, neither of which showed interest, he said. The men wanted to martyr themselves, he said. Pakistani officials arrested five of the men Wednesday, and a sixth man -- the father of one of the five -- was arrested afterward, Gujjar said. Usman Anwar, head of the district police of Sargodha, said the men initially made contact with Pakistani militants through YouTube in August while they were still in the United States. The men were watching videos of Americans being killed in Afghanistan and had posted comments, which caught the attention of the militants, Anwar said. After contact was made, a Yahoo e-mail account was set up so the men and militants could communicate, Anwar said. ""They were using a typical method that has been used by very notorious organizations,"" he said, explaining that e-mails were never sent from the account; rather, each side left messages as drafts, which were deleted after they were read. After the arrests, authorities discovered that the men had received their final orders, including their ""exact task, going to a particular spot ... and the exact method of how to get there,"" Anwar said. He did not disclose further details. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said that a team made up of U.S. Embassy security officials and FBI officials met with the men Thursday, and that consular officials will probably meet them Friday. ""It's important to emphasize at this point, we are in an information-gathering phase, but we have met with them,"" he said in a briefing Thursday with reporters. ""We're going to find out how they made their way from Washington, D.C., to Pakistan, why they were there, what their intentions were,"" he said. ""At this point, we've reached no judgments."" A U.S. law enforcement official who was not authorized to speak on the record said FBI agents based in Pakistan were interviewing the men, and added that some based in the United States would probably travel there as well. The official said he had seen reports of a sixth man arrested, but did not comment. The official, who would not provide a list of those arrested, said authorities are looking at computers the men were using in the United States, as well as cell phones and anything else they may have carried with them. Pakistani officials said Thursday that the six men are three Pakistani-Americans, an Ethiopian-American, an Egyptian-American and an Eritrean-American. President Obama said that he envisioned ""a series of investigations"" into the arrests, but he said he preferred not to comment on them. The arrests followed a Wednesday raid on a home in Sargodha, about 120 miles south of Islamabad, Pakistani police said. In the raid, investigators found laptops and maps of Pakistan containing highlighted areas that correspond to regions where terrorists have been active, police said. A Pakistani official told CNN the men arrived in Karachi on November 30 and went on to Lahore and then Sargodha, the official said. The arrests came at the behest of local police, the official said. Subira Farouk, the wife of Khalid Farouk and the mother of Umar Farouk -- both arrested -- said she and her husband had traveled to Pakistan to arrange a marriage for Umar, and to her surprise, her son had arrived in the country shortly afterward. Farouk, who spoke to CNN in Sargodha on Thursday, described her son as a business student at George Mason University who she said would never plan a terrorist attack. The mother said that she had spoken to her son before he had arrived in Pakistan and that he had mentioned going to a conference with friends. Afterward, she said she did not hear from him, prompting her to grow concerned. After speaking with his friends' parents, she said she believed that they had been kidnapped. The families contacted the Council on American-Islamic Relations and U.S. law enforcement authorities, who advised her to stay in Pakistan, she said. Later, Farouk said she received a call from a relative in Pakistan who said her son was in the country with several friends. She said she was relieved, thinking her son had surprised her, but authorities then arrested her husband, her son and his friends. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said Wednesday that it was assisting in the investigation of ""five Muslim young men from Virginia who left the country recently under mysterious circumstances."" CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper told CNN that one of the missing youths was a student at Howard University and that all five knew each other. Nihad Awad, CAIR executive director, told reporters that one left a video behind. ""I was disturbed by the content of it,"" he said. One person appeared in it and made references to ""the ongoing conflict in the world, and that young Muslims have to do something,"" Awad said. He said the video ""juxtaposed certain verses of the Quran,"" and he suggested there was a misunderstanding of those verses and their potential misuse. The video is about 11 minutes long, he said, and is ""like a farewell.""

"(CNN) -- South Korean and American warships stopped a suspected pirate attack on an Egyptian ship in the Gulf of Aden, capturing 17 suspected pirates, the U.S. Navy announced Thursday. The USS Gettyburg helped stopped a suspected pirate attack, detaining 17 people. The South Korean destroyer ROKS Munmu the Great and cruiser USS Gettysburg launched helicopters in response to a distress call from the MV Amira, the Navy statement said. While en route to the Egyptian-flagged ship, they spotted a dhow that the navies suspected was being used as a pirate ""mother ship."" An American search-and-seizure team boarded the dhow and found eight assault rifles, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and one rocket-propelled grenade, the Navy said. All 17 people aboard the boat were detained. It was the first time the anti-piracy task force CTF 151 had captured suspected pirates, the Navy said. Numerous military ships from around the world have been dispatched to patrol the waters off the coast of Somalia in the face of an explosion in piracy in the region over the past several years. Pirates currently hold 15 ships, said Cyrus Mody of the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors piracy worldwide. All those ships were seized in the waters off the east coast of Africa, he told CNN.","South Korean and American warships stop a suspected Somali pirate attack .

"(CNN) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson says U.S policies are partially responsible for Haiti's economic problems. In a CNN ""Newsroom"" interview with Ali Velshi, Jackson declared: ""Our agricultural policy ... allowed the Riceland Rice company to drop rice on Haiti, drive Haiti farmers out of business, and then raise the price of rice and have rice riots."" Jackson's comments echo a 2005 report by the international relief agency Oxfam International, which said U.S. policies hurt Haitian farmers and helped Arkansas-based Riceland Foods, the world's largest miller and marketer of rice. ""Riceland's profits jumped by $123 million from 2002 to 2003, thanks in large part to a 50 percent increase in exports, primarily to Haiti and Cuba,"" the report said. CNN was unable to obtain any immediate response from Riceland Foods, which said publicly its sales to Haiti have declined over the years, but a CNN Fact Check suggests that U.S. policies have indeed played a role in Haiti's problems. In a 2006 report, the Cato Institute, a nonprofit Washington-based research foundation, called rice ""one of the most heavily supported commodities in the United States,"" and argued that several countries including Haiti ""could all plausibly claim that the U.S. rice program has driven down global prices to the detriment of their citizens."" ""Until the 1980s,"" the Washington Post recently reported, ""Haiti grew almost all the rice that it ate. But in 1986, under pressure from foreign governments, including the United States, Haiti removed its tariff on imported rice."" The subsidized U.S. rice was cheaper than Haitian rice, and soon, it became a staple of the Haitian diet. Many Haitian rice farmers were driven out of business, fleeing to the slums of Port-au-Prince. Later, the price of rice began to rise. It doubled in a little over a year, sparking food riots in Haiti in 2008. At least six people died before President Rene Preval announced plans to subsidize rice.","In 2006 report, Cato Institute said rice is heavily supported commodity in U.S.

"Washington (CNN) -- A U.S. missile defense test failed Sunday when a long-range missile missed its target because of radar problems. The Defense Department said a target missile was launched from an Army test site at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands at 7:40 p.m. Six minutes later, a second missile was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, to find the first one and destroy it. Both missiles flew successfully, but missed each other because of a problem in the sea-based X-band radar, the department's Missile Defense Agency said. The X-band radar sits atop a modified floating oil platform and provides information about incoming missiles so military officials can launch a response. ""Both the target missile and ground-based interceptor performed nominally after launch. However, the sea-based X-band radar did not perform as expected,"" the agency said. Officials intend to investigate the cause of the interception failure.","Test missile fired from Pacific atoll .

"(CNN) -- Even before her 18th birthday, Maria had already been enslaved by a gang of human traffickers and held in captivity for four months in her homeland of Mexico. While a prisoner, Maria witnessed a sickening trade in human life and recalls how young girls were drugged, forced into prostitution and then murdered. What makes Maria's story so special is that she was one of the lucky ones who were able to escape. Maria, whose real name we aren't using, used to live in the border town of Ciudad Juarez. The city is home to two drug cartels that fight a bloody turf war for lucrative smuggling routes to America. In a four-day period, 41 people were murdered, while over the past decade, 450 women were killed and 3,000 went missing. ""Today girls are still going missing but their bodies are never found,"" Miguel Perea, a local journalist told Britain's Channel 4. ""There's no trace of them and their mothers and families of these girls -- they haven't got a clue what's happened to them."" Maria described how at the age of 16 she was lured off the streets by a young man who promised the world, but delivered nothing but pain. She was raped, drugged and sold for sex. ""They took a gallon of gasoline and started pouring it over a girl,"" Maria said. ""One of the men told me if you don't do as I say I will do the same to you. ""I wanted to look away, but they didn't let me. Even though the girl was on fire they kept hitting her and they were laughing as if they were enjoying what they were doing."" Maria described a cross-border trade in young children and babies -- with orders coming in regularly from the U.S. ""They stole the children and one of the gang members took a six-year-old kid that I had to look after for three hours. ""He told me he wanted to see his mummy then I started crying and said 'I don't think you're ever going to see your mummy again.'"" The claims that Maria made were so serious that she was asked by the Department of Homeland Security to come to the U.S. to tell her story. Mexican authorities accompanied Maria on her trip to Houston to work alongside U.S. authorities on the case. The U.S. State Department estimates that more than 20,000 people are trafficked into the U.S. each year -- mainly destined for the sex trade. Authorities have launched an immediate investigation into Maria's story. ""I want to tell the story so that in the near future, other girls don't go through the same,"" Maria said. ""Women are sold, they are abducted, bought and even killed by these men. ""If these men are ever found, jail won't be enough to make them pay for the way they've made us feel.""","The Mexican border town of Ciudad Juarez is one of the world's most dangerous .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- There are around 200 known types of cancers. Some are far more widespread than others. Australian Professor Ian Frazer has developed a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer and is working on a vaccine for skin cancer. Cancer researchers are making significant breakthroughs in unlocking the complete genetic makeup of many common cancers. Through extensive studies and research, they are understanding exactly how the rogue cells differ from normal cells, and modifying treatments so they work on just the cancer cells. We take a look at some of the most common types of cancers plus some possible causes, treatments and developments. Lung Cancer  Lung cancer develops when cells of the lungs divide and grow in an uncontrolled manner. There are two types of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The latter is more likely to spread further in the body in its early stages. Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, with 1.2 million new cases every year. Nearly all lung cancers arise because of smoking and men have always been more affected by lung cancer than women. However, a rise in female smoking worldwide has started reversing the trend. Treatments . Not all lung-cancer patients are suitable for surgery. Surgery on non-small cell lung cancers is more common than in small cell lung cancer, but can still only happen in a minority of cases. Other options are radio therapy and chemotherapy. Developments . In December 2008, scientists pinpointed a gene that protects against lung cancer. It is hoped the discovery of the role of the tumor suppressor gene -- LIMD1 -- may lead to new treatments and techniques to pick up the disease earlier. The disease is often not picked up until it has reached an advanced stage and many patients die within a year of being diagnosed. Skin Cancer  Skin cancer is a malignant growth on the skin. It generally develops in the outermost layer of skin, so a tumor is usually clearly visible and easier to detect than most other cancers. Skin cancer is the most diagnosed form of the disease, surpassing lung, breast, colorectal and prostate cancer. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that usually starts within a mole or a dark spot on the skin. If found early, simple surgical treatment works well and usually leads to a cure, the British Medical Journal advises. However they can spread quickly and are responsible for the majority of skin-cancer-related deaths. It's not entirely clear why skin cancers develop, but according to the U.S. National Institute of Health,  UV radiation from the sun is the main cause. UV radiation is particularly harmful for children and teenagers and even a short exposure can lead to skin cancer much later in life. Diagnosis and Treatment  Diagnosis is made with a skin biopsy, under local anesthetic with an injection. Treatment depends on the circumstances of the cancer and the patient; including age, type of cancer and location. Treatments can include, amongst others, radiotherapy (radiation), chemotherapy (pills) and surgery. Developments  Scientists have recently conducted experiments on ""immune-priming,""-- using the patients' own immune systems to fight the skin cancer. This therapy is still relatively new, but has been shown to boost the immune system and thereby attack skin cancers and viruses. The Australian scientist who developed a vaccine for cervical cancer, Ian Frazer, told Australia's Medical Research Congress in November 2008 that he is working on a skin cancer vaccine that could be available within a decade. Breast Cancer . Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant cells form in the breast tissue, leading to damage to the cells' DNA. This results in cell division and growth and eventually leads to the formation of a lump. The malignant cells can then invade other organs where metastases (secondary lumps) may form. Breast cancer is the most common in women, affecting one in nine women at some point in their lives. The World Health Organization states that breast cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer deaths, causing 502,000 deaths worldwide in 2005. Diagnosis and Treatment  Women are encouraged to check their breasts regularly for any lumps or other irregularities, such as discharge from the nipple. General practitioners or gynecologists can also do physical checks. To make a diagnosis, doctors can perform a mammogram or an ultrasound and take a tissue sample. Once a lump has been identified as malignant, the most common treatments are surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Developments  Interstitial laser thermotherapy (ILT) is a relatively new minimally invasive, laser surgery procedure that reduces the possibility of complications during and after an operation. Prostate Cancer . Prostate cancer develops in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. It occurs when cells of the prostate mutate and begin to multiply out of control. These cells may spread from the prostate to other parts of the body. Rates of prostate cancer vary widely across the world and are most common in Europe and the United States. It is least common in South and East Asia, according to the figures from Cancer Research UK. A quarter of all new cases of cancer diagnosed in British men are prostate cancers. Almost 60 per cent of prostate cancer cases are diagnosed in men aged over 70 years.  Diagnosis and Treatment . Prostate cancer is most often discovered by prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening and less commonly by physical examination through the rectum or by the appearance of symptoms. Treatment options for prostate cancer depend on the age of the man, his health and the spread of the cancer. The most common treatments are surgery and radiation therapy. Colorectal cancer . Colorectal cancer, also called colon cancer or large bowel cancer, includes cancerous growths in the colon, rectum and appendix. According to the WHO, colorectal cancer causes 655,000 deaths worldwide per year and is the third most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the Western world . Risk factors and symptoms  According to the American Cancer Society, the following factors increase the risk for colorectal cancer: . • Age: Most cases occur in people in their 60s and 70s. Cases in people aged 50 or under are uncommon unless a family history of early colon cancer is present. • Women who have had cancer of the ovary, uterus, or breast have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. • A history of colorectal cancer in the family . • Smoking . Treatment  Surgery is the primary treatment, while radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be applied depending on the patient, the tumor's stage and other medical factors. If performed at a late stage or when the cancer has already spread, colorectal cancer is unlikely to be cured with surgery.","We take a look at some common types of cancers and the facts behind them .

"(CNN) --  A man accused of shooting two students at a Littleton, Colorado, middle school last week was formally charged Tuesday in the incident, according to a spokeswoman for the Jefferson County district attorney's office. Bruco Strongeagle Eastwood, 32, appeared via video link before Judge Thomas Vance to hear the 15 charges against him, which include attempted first-degree murder, first-degree assault, child abuse resulting in bodily injury and possession of a weapon on school grounds, district attorney spokeswoman Pam Russell said. He is being held with bond set at $1 million. Authorities accuse Eastwood of shooting at students outside Deer Creek Middle School on February 23 shortly after classes let out for the day. Police say he wounded two eighth-graders before being subdued by a teacher. One student, Reagan Weber, was treated and released from Littleton Adventist Hospital, according to CNN affiliate KUSA. The other, Matthew Thieu, sustained more serious injuries and was hospitalized at Denver's Children's Hospital. He has since been released, the hospital said Tuesday. An attorney was appointed for Eastwood, and the attorney has until March 12 to schedule a preliminary hearing, Russell said. Deer Creek is just two miles from Columbine High School, site of one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history, where 12 students and one teacher were gunned down in 1999. The two gunmen, both Columbine students, then turned their guns on themselves.

"(CNN) -- The world has a new alliance to save vanishing frogs, toads and salamanders. A frog swims in a pond in Munich, Germany, in June. A coalition of organizations established the Amphibian Survival Alliance this month to conserve species threatened by deadly fungus, habitat loss, pollution, pesticides and climate change. The scientists said amphibians are the world's most threatened group of animals. Though they thrived on Earth for more than 360 million years, one in three of the 6,000 recognized amphibian species are now at risk of extinction and as many as 122 species have gone extinct since 1980, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's amphibian specialist group. ""The world's amphibians are facing an uphill battle for survival,"" said James Collins of Arizona State University, co-chairman of the group. He said the new alliance, formed at the Amphibian Mini Summit at the Zoological Society of London, will focus efforts on the biggest threat to amphibians: infectious disease and habitat destruction. The group includes amphibian specialists working in the wild as well as those in zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens worldwide. ""Amphibians have so much to offer humans,"" said amphibian specialist Simon Stuart. ""Many have an arsenal of compounds stored in their skin that have the potential to address a multitude of human diseases."" But as amphibians die out, so do opportunities to develop new medicines, he said. The southern gastric brooding frog, for instance, could have led to the development of a treatment for human peptic ulcers had it not gone extinct, Stuart said. ""We simply cannot afford to let this current amphibian extinction crisis go unchecked,"" he said. Andrew Blaustein, who began documenting amphibian declines two decades ago, said the loss of species was part of an overall biodiversity crisis. ""Amphibians seem to have been hit the hardest of all vertebrate species,"" said Blaustein, a professor of zoology at Oregon State University. ""The long-term ecological repercussions of their decline could be profound, and we have to do something about it.""","Amphibian Survival Alliance aims to save threatened frogs, toads, salamanders .

"(CNN) -- After reviewing the case of a woman who died at New Orleans, Louisiana's Memorial Hospital in the days after Hurricane Katrina, coroner Frank Minyard said Thursday that he cannot classify her death as a homicide. Minyard said he hopes his findings on the death of Jannie Burgess, 79, will mark ""the end of the Memorial Hospital hurricane situation."" The review was initiated after an August 2009 New York Times article quoted a doctor as saying Memorial patients were given morphine and other drugs after Katrina struck in August 2005, with hospital staff knowing that it could hasten some of the patients' deaths. Burgess' manner of death is unclassified, the coroner said, and the cause of her death undetermined. ""I don't think -- and I could be wrong -- I don't think the morphine contributed as much to her demise as her physical condition,"" said Minyard, who's served as the coroner of Orleans Parish since 1974. ""This patient was extremely sick,"" Minyard said of Burgess. The woman had had surgery a week before and had been on ""morphine around the clock. She'd had kidney failure. She'd had liver failure."" She also had developed sepsis, or blood poisoning, he said. Burgess was being treated for advanced uterine cancer and kidney failure, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. Dr. Ewing Cook told the New York Times that he asked a nurse to increase Burgess' morphine and give her ""enough until she goes."" ""If you don't think that by giving a person a lot of morphine, you're not prematurely sending them to their grave, then you're a very naive doctor,"" Cook told the Times. ""We kill 'em."" On Burgess, he said, ""I gave her medicine so I could get rid of her faster, get the nurses off the floor."" He added, ""There's no question I hastened her demise."" In response to a Times-Picayune report in September, Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro Jr. said he planned to look into the deaths but stopped short of calling it an investigation. Minyard said Thursday that he had delivered a detailed report to Cannizzaro on Wednesday. Because she had been receiving morphine, Burgess had naturally developed some tolerance to it, Minyard said. He also took her weight, 240 pounds, into account. Burgess had received seven 15-milligram shots of morphine and died 3½ hours after receiving the last one, he said. Deaths from morphine, or any narcotic, tend to happen immediately, he said. Minyard said he believes that Burgess' blood poisoning, along with anemia she had before her surgery, mostly contributed to her death. ""I'm saying 'mostly' because we really don't know,"" he said. ""And when you really don't know, you have to be 100 percent sure"" when calling a death a homicide. He said he doesn't believe that Burgess received enough morphine to kill her. Minyard said Thursday that when he told Burgess' relatives about his findings, ""they were very polite."" He said they will come in to speak with him soon. Katrina roared ashore near the Mississippi-Louisiana state line on August 29, 2005, rupturing three of New Orleans' protective levees and putting about three-quarters of the city under water. Charles Foti Jr., who was then the state attorney general, launched an investigation after officials from Lifecare, an acute-care facility operating on the seventh floor of Memorial, reported allegations that several seriously ill, mostly elderly patients had been euthanized by medical staff at Memorial as the floodwaters rose around the hospital and conditions inside deteriorated. In 2006, Foti ordered the arrest of Dr. Anna Pou and two nurses, Lori Budo and Cheri Landry, on preliminary charges of second-degree murder in the deaths of four of the patients. Former Orleans Parish District Attorney Eddie Jordan, who under Louisiana law was responsible for prosecuting crimes, gave Budo and Landry immunity in exchange for their testimony. In July 2007, a grand jury refused to indict Pou. Foti said his investigation revealed that the four patients were given a ""lethal cocktail"" of morphine and midazolam hydrochloride, both central nervous system depressants. The patients were 63, 68, 91 and 93, he said. Pou, Landry and Budo denied the charges, and their attorneys said they acted heroically, staying to treat patients rather than evacuate. In an interview with Newsweek magazine in 2007, Pou admitted giving the patients drugs. ""If in doing so it hastened their deaths, then that's what happened,"" she said. ""But this was not 'I'm going to go to the seventh floor and murder some people.' We're here to help patients."" The grand jury never heard testimony from five specialists who advised Foti that the patients were deliberately killed with overdoses of drugs after Katrina struck. All five were brought in by Foti's office to analyze the deaths and concluded that the patients were homicide victims. After the grand jury refused to indict Pou, Jordan called the case closed and said he would no longer pursue it. CNN and the Times-Picayune have filed suit seeking the release of Foti's investigative file into the deaths. CNN was the first to report the allegations of euthanasia, six weeks after the hurricane. The case went to the Louisiana Supreme Court, which in July sent it back to the trial court to rule on whether criminal charges in the case are reasonably anticipated. No new trial date has been set, Lori Mince, the New Orleans attorney representing the media organization, said Thursday. Hospital workers identified only as John and Jane Does have sued to block the file's release, claiming that the records are covered by grand jury secrecy rules, that they should have been considered confidential informants and that releasing the documents would violate their privacy.","79-year-old Jannie Burgess died in New Orleans hospital .

"(CNN) -- A little over a week ago nearly every media outlet was fixated on Tiger Woods and his apology news conference. We saw pundits, columnists, journalists, radio talk show hosts, psychologists, body language experts, entertainers and anyone with an opinion weigh in on the sincerity of Tiger: Was he really sorry for committing adultery, should he apologize further and hundreds of other angles. Some even described him as a fallen athlete who will lose millions of endorsements and a man who has destroyed the trust he built up with his fans. I even heard one woman say she needed Tiger to apologize, yet couldn't articulate why it mattered so much to her, especially since she wasn't his wife, kin to him, and wasn't a family friend. Yet if there was ever one athlete we could truly place in that category of fallen athlete, it would be former NBA star Jayson Williams. While Tiger brought shame on himself and his family by his admitted extramarital affairs, he has broken no laws, and what he did doesn't affect us at all. Yet Williams is another matter. This week, he was led away in handcuffs after being sentenced in a New Jersey court for fatally shooting a limo driver on February 14, 2002. Some carried his sentencing live. Yet most networks ignored his case, which ended eight years of courtroom drama. Frankly, if there was a case that is instructive to kids who look up to athletes, it's Jayson, not Tiger. Jayson Williams was a gregarious and fun-loving man who could light up the court. After injuries took their toll and ended his NBA career, he was a rising TV analyst with NBC, a playful man with a big heart. I'll never forget watching him on ""Oprah"" with his dad as they talked about building his huge mansion, how it was a place where hundreds of kids traveled through as a result of his charitable endeavors and how he had a zest for life. But that all ended on the night the life of Costas Christofi ended. After a dinner, Williams returned to his home and was showing several folks his many guns when he snapped his double-barreled 12-gauge shotgun shut. Williams didn't realize it was loaded, and a single bullet hit Christofi in the chest. A panicked Williams put the gun in Christofi's hand, and even jumped in his pool, hoping to wash away the evidence. Williams was acquitted of aggravated manslaughter and convicted on four counts of coverup. He settled with Christofi's family for $2 million, all while the case went back and forth through the legal system. While that was happening, Williams began to lose it all. His wife filed for divorce; he was hit with a stun gun by police after an encounter; he crashed his vehicle in another incident and threatened to kill himself. Williams was a man who fell victim to alcohol and guns, a deadly combination. He was sentenced to five years in jail and is eligible for parole in 18 months. Everything he had -- money, fame, budding TV career, marriage, friends, respect -- all lost because of the horrible decisions he made one fateful night. Jayson Williams didn't achieve the level of fame as Tiger Woods, but we can surely learn more from his fall from grace than Tiger's. The former killed a man, the latter cheated on his wife. Both morally wrong, only one legally wrong. Tiger will undoubtedly return to the golf course one day. Sure, he can fret about losing millions in endorsements and may have to confront losing his wife. But Williams must forever live with the memory of a man dying as a result of his actions. We all may want to focus on Tiger, but it's the tragedy of Jayson Williams that should have all of us talking and examining what went wrong in the charmed life of a basketball star. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Roland Martin cites case of NBA ex Jayson Williams .

And right behind our squadron area was the Marine mortuary, where they'd lay out the bodies, check their dog tags and fingerprint them for identification,"" recalls Yellin, an 87-year-old retiree who lives in Vero Beach, Florida. ""I've lived with those memories all of my life and it was not something I ever wanted to go back to."" Nevertheless, Yellin was back on the island last week for the first time since 1945 to attend a ceremony commemorating the battle's 65th anniversary. About 22,000 Japanese soldiers died defending the island, along with more than 6,000 Americans, in a battle that was memorialized in the iconic photograph of five U.S. Marines and a Navy corpsman raising the U.S. flag atop Mount Suribachi, the island's dormant volcano. The Americans secured the island on March 26, 1945, marking the U.S. military's most significant advance in its island-hopping strategy to reach Japan. But the battle proved to be longer and deadlier than planners had anticipated, depleting much of the U.S. military's resources. The U.S. abandoned its plan to invade the Japanese mainland and turned to the atomic bomb to end the war. Since 1995, the Japanese and American associations of Iwo Jima have met on the 8-square-mile island, now known as Iwo To, to commemorate the 35-day battle with a ""Reunion of Honor."" Yellin and several other veterans made the day-long trip to Iwo Jima from Guam on March 3 with the tour company, Military Tours. Each man had his own reason for going, but all left united through the shared experience of an event that only a few can understand, says Cyril ""Cy"" O'Brien, a Marine correspondent who covered the Battle of Iwo Jima, who also made the trip. ""In a way, it's reliving something that happened so long ago that was probably what I would consider some of the most ennobling moments of our lives. I am a writer, too, so going there this time, looking at the terrain and seeing this hill, this cliff, this gorge, opens a whole new page to the memory,"" he says. O'Brien, a retired newspaper reporter who is working on a book about his experiences as a war correspondent, has been back to Iwo Jima for the Reunion of Honor four times. But the sense of awe never diminishes as the first sight of the island from the plane, he says. ""When we approached Iwo Jima and saw Suribachi, you would be amazed what happens. Everything became as quiet and as solemn as if we'd entered a cathedral. You could tell the island had captivated everyone, the island had brought them back to their youth. The first moment was a very stirring moment. Always is,"" he says. For Yellin, it has been a longer journey back to the battlefield where, as a young airman, he left behind 11 comrades, sparking years of bitterness and racial prejudice. Yellin recalls passing over the flag each time he and his brothers flew a mission to support the Marines on the ground, who faced the formidable task of taking the island from a military force on its last stand. ""I never thought of the people on the ground as people. You can hate somebody so much that you don't see them as people,"" he says. ""I had no desire to go back to Japan. Why the hell would you want to visit the place where your enemy was? Who wants to visit the people you fought against and hated?"" The healing began in 1988, when his son married a Japanese woman whose father was a pilot in the Japanese Imperial Army Air Service, who also flew missions in Iwo Jima. Yellin's son's future in-laws opposed the marriage until the men met and shared their experiences in Iwo Jima. ""I hated him and he hated me. We met for the first time three days before the wedding. And he said, 'Any man that could fly a P-51 against the Japanese and live must be a brave man, and I want the blood of that man to flow through the veins of my grandchildren.'"" he says. ""Then, my son got married and started having children and my whole life expanded. I saw that human beings were killed in the war, and they were kind people, they were bright people, and now they're my family."" Through the marriage, the two wartime enemies made peace, a process that Yellin documented in a novel published last year, ""Of War & Weddings."" But he still never considered visiting Iwo Jima until he was offered an opportunity to commemorate his fallen brothers -- 11 in combat and five in training -- from the 78th Fighter Squadron in a ceremony during the Reunion of Honor. Upon learning of his plans, Yellin's 18-year-old grandson expressed interest in seeing the place where his grandfathers had once fought each other. ""I just didn't want to relive all that, but because I have a Japanese grandson and because he wanted to go, I had to go,"" says Yellin. ""And I'm happy, delighted, thrilled that I went. I cried most of the day, from the moment we landed. Many memories came back, and we did a memorial for the 16 guys. It was like closing the circle.""","Retired fighter pilot Jerry Yellin returns to Iwo Jima with son, grandson for ""Reunion of Honor""

"(CNN) -- A 62-year-old Michigan man was severely burned when a homemade rocket strapped on his back exploded while he slid down a snowy hill on a sled, authorities said this week. The rocket stunt was the grand finale on Saturday during the man's annual sledding party at his Oakland County, Michigan, home, the sheriff's department said. ""He is known for doing 'crazy things' at his parties,"" an Oakland County sheriff's department statement said. ""On this date, after consuming an unknown quantity of alcohol, he constructed a device out of a motorcycle muffler and pipe."" Inside the makeshift rocket, the victim placed gunpowder, heads from matches and gasoline. He donned a helmet and took a sled to the top of a snowy embankment. ""He asked another person to light a wick and then began to sled down a hill. At some point during the ride downhill, the device exploded. The results of the explosion were second-degree burns to the victim's face,"" the sheriff's department statement said. No one else was injured during the incident. The man, whose identity is not yet known, was hospitalized with significant damage to one of his eyes and could face criminal charges, authorities said.","Makeshift rocket sled stunt goes awry for Michigan man, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- The same hands that are helping Haiti recover from a massive earthquake could cripple its long-term recovery. That's the concern voiced by some Haitian scholars, natives and relief workers. The world has rallied to Haiti's side since the January 12 earthquake killed at least 217,000 people and displaced at least a million in the impoverished island nation. Yet the same groups that have lined up to help Haitians the past two months -- foreign governments, relief groups and companies pledging to rebuild  -- could hobble Haiti's long-term survival, some say. Ronald Agenor, a Haitian-American, says he's grateful for the world's assistance. But he doesn't want the earthquake to wipe out one of his native country's most precious assets: its independence. ""We're not a country anymore,"" said Agenor, a former top-ranked professional tennis player. ""It doesn't seem like we have a government. We're a place where people go to give money."" How aid can hinder Haiti's government . Much of Haiti's national identity is shaped around its unique history. Haitians are the descendants of the only slaves who revolted against their masters in the 19th century. Haiti, though, has struggled since it broke away from its colonial rulers, the French. Even before the earthquake, unemployment hovered around 50 percent, and more than half of all Haitians live on a dollar a day. Ongoing political instability adds to Haiti's misery. Western nations and relief groups have stepped in over the years to help. But some of that help has backfired, says Alex Dupuy, a native of Haiti and a professor of sociology at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. ""Haiti has been transformed over the years into an aid-dependent country,"" Dupuy said. ""Much of the aid has further weakened the ability of the state to deliver."" In Haiti, the government doesn't provide basic services such as sanitation, electricity and drinking water, Dupuy says. Much of that is provided by non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, like relief groups, he says. ""It becomes a vicious cycle,"" Dupuy said. ""The state is never forced to face up to its responsibilities."" Educated Haitians could stay and help their country, but many prefer to move elsewhere for more comfortable living, Dupuy says. ""There are more Haitian doctors practicing medicine in Montreal than in Haiti,"" Dupuy said. Full earthquake coverage . Those educated Haitians who do stay are often siphoned off into working for the non-governmental organizations stationed there, says J. Phil Thompson, an urban studies professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has traveled to disaster zones around the world to help communities recover. Thompson says there are about 10,000 NGOs in Haiti. ""Haitians often don't want to work for the government, because the salaries can't compete with the donations various intermediaries can pay,"" Thompson said. Profiting from Haiti's misery . Helping hands have hurt Haiti in the past, some Haitians say. Powerful outsiders took advantage of Haiti's weakened government for profit. Dupuy says that in the early 1970s, Haiti was self-sufficient in its rice production. Today, it is the fourth largest importer of rice from American farmers who are subsidized by the U.S. government. The change came about because much of the foreign aid to Haiti had strings attached. Haiti had to remove its tariffs and open its economy to foreign imports, he says. ""All of which had devastating impacts on Haitian agriculture,"" Dupuy said. ""Haiti has nothing to show for it. Now it imports 25 percent of the food it consumes."" Haiti's impoverished condition also provides opportunity for companies that flock to the country. ""It's being used as a haven for cheap labor in the textiles and garment industries,"" Dupuy says. ""Those industries are going to Haiti because there is an abundance of the cheapest labor in the Western hemisphere."" Even those companies that promise to help rebuild Haiti must be viewed with suspicion, one scholar says. Haiti's recovery could be hampered by unscrupulous outsiders and opportunistic Haitians who may seize land for themselves by passing their efforts off as ""helping the recovery,"" Thompson said. After Hurricane Katrina wiped out the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans, Louisiana, a group of developers proposed turning the area into a golf course, Thompson says. After the 2004 Asian tsunami, developers proposed building luxury hotels on the fishing communities that had just been wiped out, he added. The same pattern could repeat itself in Port-au-Prince, the capital, to ""redevelop"" Haiti, Thompson says. ""Everywhere I've worked, where there's been a disaster, there's been land grabs by the elite,"" Thompson said. Haitians say how their country can recover . Haitians can come out of this disaster stronger if they take more control of their destiny, Thompson says. Thompson suggests that Haitians create a social investment fund, which would be used to funnel money that expatriates send to their homeland into investments in renewable energy, education and housing. It's been estimated that up to 36 percent of Haiti's gross national product comes from remittances, or money Haitians receive from other Haitians abroad. ""Because Haitians are investing in Haiti, they are going to make sure no one is ripped off,"" Thompson said of the investment fund. Agenor, the Haitian-American tennis player, recommends an even more subtle change for improving his country's prospects: teach more English to Haitian youth. Creole and French are the primary languages in Haiti. But the best employment opportunities for Haitians rest about an hour's flight away in the U.S., where English is the main language, Agenor says. ""We have a French culture, but we're so close to America,"" said Agenor, who now lives in Los Angeles, California. ""When Haitians go to America, they don't speak English. They can't go to college. When other English-speaking islanders go to America, 80 percent of the job is done."" Relief groups can help Haitians in the short term by not only providing food, shelter and water but  by hiring Haitian workers in reconstruction projects and soliciting their advice, one relief expert says. ""There's nothing worse than a bunch of foreigners coming in to fix everything,"" said David Humphries, a spokesman for CHF International, a humanitarian organization that is in Haiti. ""Self-esteem and buy-in are very important for any community. They need to say, 'This is our building, our hospital.' "" iReport: Haiti's missing and found . Local input can also avoid wasting precious resources, Humphries says. ""You can build a hospital, but if there's no functional road to it, it's a white elephant,"" Humphries said. ""People will despise it. Go in the community, get their input and employ them."" Despite the challenges ahead, some Haitians remain optimistic. News accounts of the earthquake's aftermath are filled with stories about the resilience of Haitian people. Maggie Boyer, a Haitian native who is communications director for World Vision, an international Christian humanitarian agency, says the street vendors and the colorful Tap-Tap taxicabs have returned to the streets of Port-au-Prince. ""Given our history as the first black republic,"" Boyer said, ""this has left us with the sense that we are good, we can win, and we can go forward.""","Massive aid flowing into Haiti could hobble country's recovery, some say .

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- The Philippines government has increased security in the southern region of Maguindanao after gunmen kidnapped and killed at least 22 people, according to military officials and the country's national news agency. Some of the bodies were beheaded, according to Filipino media. The details suggest the daytime abductions were politically motivated, and the military said the gunmen were loyal to the province's incumbent governor. Those killed include a gubernatorial candidate's wife and one of his sisters, according to two of his family members who spoke on local television. The death toll also included at least 12 journalists, according to Reporters Without Borders, a media freedom organization. Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu wanted to run for governor of Maguindanao province in May but had received threats he would be kidnapped if he filed the candidate nomination papers himself. He sent his wife and sisters to file the papers, thinking ""that women would have some protection,"" journalist Maria Ressa told CNN. ""It was supposed to be a media event,"" Ressa said, ""[to] let the public know that this politician would run for governor."" Army officials said 100 gunmen surrounded the group of about 40 people -- many local journalists and women among them -- and ordered them out of their vehicles. They took the hostages to a mountainous region, officials said. Some of the women were raped and tortured, according to media reports. The military confirmed finding 22 bodies, some of them reportedly beheaded. ""Never in the history of journalism have the news media suffered such a heavy loss of life in one day,"" Reporters Without Borders said of the 12 journalists reported dead. The military has said the gunmen are loyal to Maguindanao Gov. Andal Ampatuan, who has held control of the area for the past decade and is a longtime ally of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Neither Ampatuan nor his advisers have commented on the allegation. Maguindanao is a province in Mindanao, a Muslim autonomous region out of the control of the central government. The Philippines government said it increased security in the region after the attacks. Jesus Dureza, an adviser to Macapagal-Arroyo, called the slayings ""a gruesome massacre of civilians unequaled in recent history."" Dureza, Macapagal-Arroyo's adviser on Mindanao affairs, has asked the government to place Maguindanao province under a state of emergency. Elections in the Philippines have long been marred by violence, but Monday's abductions and killings shocked the nation. Macapagal-Arroyo condemned the killings and ordered more Filipino troops to the region to bolster security, according to the Philippines News Agency. She also ordered the Armed Forces of the Philippines ""to conduct immediate and relentless pursuit of the perpetrators [and] to secure the affected areas,"" the agency reported. Military checkpoints are being set up as part of the security effort, state media reported. Aid agencies operating in the region have long complained about a climate of fear in the region, where the government has little control and private armies operate freely. Reporters Without Borders said it has been outspoken in criticizing ""the culture of impunity and violence in the Philippines, especially Mindanao."" ""This time, the frenzied violence of thugs working for corrupt politicians has resulted in an incomprehensible bloodbath,"" the organization said. ""We call for a strong reaction from the local and national authorities."" Journalist Maria Ressa contributed to this report.","NEW: Death toll rises; dead include at least 12 journalists .

"(CNN) -- Jose Reyes Ferriz, the mayor of violence-plagued Ciudad Juarez, said the drug cartel war gripping his city is rooted in social decomposition such as broken homes. The president of Mexico is expected to make a major announcement on social intervention in response to the drug violence, which in 2010 has killed close to 1,000 people throughout the country, says Reyes. President Felipe Calderon is expected to be in the city on the U.S. border across from El Paso, Texas, on Thursday. ""We have been working during the last couple of years on cleaning up and reinforcing our police department,"" Reyes said in a phone interview with CNN this week. ""Having done that, it is time to go to the root of the problem. The root of the problem is a social problem that we did not anticipate. We need to work on that."" Also this week, in what is seen widely as a symbolic gesture in response to last week's house party massacre that killed 15, the Chihuahua state government on Monday temporarily moved its main offices to Juarez, Reyes confirmed. ""What will happen is the governor, state Supreme Court, as well as Congress will all operate out of Juarez,"" according to Reyes. ""Them being here will expedite a lot of things that need to be done in Juarez."" He joins experts in saying it is a social decomposition of a new generation of cartel members that is causing such brutal killings. Broken homes, sometimes caused by drug abuse, leave children and teens vulnerable to a gang's plea for membership. The young recruits are more ruthless than ever. In one local report, the face of a drug cartel hit victim was found cut from the victim's head and stitched onto a soccer ball. In other reports, organized criminals have shot and killed children, targeted innocent students, assassinated doctors and lawyers and even extorted priests. On January 31, 15 people -- most of them teenage students who had nothing to do with the cartels -- were massacred at a house party in southern Juarez. Witnesses described some of the hit men who carried out the killings as being about the same age as the victims. A federal security spokesman told CNN last week that 10 drug traffickers -- part of a cell that worked for Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, head of the Sinaloa Cartel -- were arrested in the Valley of Juarez. One of the suspects told investigators children have been recruited as lookouts and are being paid between $40 to $80 a week to work for the cartel. There is hope for progress. ""We were down to five killings a day before Sunday's [house party] massacre,"" Reyes said. ""The massive presence of police in the city discourages that sort of access."" Other measures have been proposed. One Mexican lawmaker wants to censor social media networks such as Twitter, suggesting cartels use the service to locate targets. Reyes knows a life without cartels in Mexico is close to impossible. ""It's unrealistic to think that cartels will be stamped out entirely,"" the mayor said. ""When you take a look at what happened with Florida. Most of the coke (cocaine) came through the Caribbean, through Florida. And ... when the [U.S.] federal government closed down that route, most of the coke started coming from Mexico. That's when the violence started in the country.""","Jose Reyes Ferriz, mayor of Juarez, says police action can only go so far .

"Washington (CNN) -- A beloved giant panda will leave for China early next year to the disappointment of millions of fans in the United States. Washington's National Zoo will say goodbye to 4-year-old Tai Shan as he makes his way to a breeding base in southwestern China. He'll leave during the first quarter of 2010, according to the zoo and Chinese state-run media. Tai Shan -- on loan from China -- was born at the National Zoo to pandas that also are borrowed from China. His father, 11-year-old Tian Tian, and his mother, 10-year-old Mei Xiang, are due in China in December 2010, according to the Xinhua news agency. ""While we're proud to send off a healthy panda to be part of China's breeding program, we will indeed miss him dearly,"" the National Zoo's Web site said of Tai Shan. He has more growing to do, however. ""Although Tai Shan has the build of a grownup male panda, we still have to wait for about two years before it is sexually mature,"" said Li Desheng, deputy director of the management office of the Wolong National Natural Reserve in Sichuan province, according to Xinhua. Tai Shan will never be released into the wild, but there is the hope that his offspring could be, the National Zoo said. ""Since we partnered with them 10 years ago, the Chinese have more than doubled their cub production, which means they're about to reach the significant goal of having 300 pandas in captivity,"" the zoo said on its Web site. ""By reaching the target of 300 pandas, collectively we will ensure that the giant panda in captivity is demographically and genetically secure. It will be a huge conservation achievement."" The United States has 13 pandas on loan from China, according to Xinhua. The three in Washington and one each in Atlanta, Georgia, and San Diego, California, are due to return to China next year. Though Tai Shan has lived in Washington, his fans have followed him online for years, via the National Zoo's Pandacam. They've oohed and aahed as he's frolicked, had milestone exams and grown -- from less than 2 pounds at birth to more than 200 pounds at his peak weight.","Washington's National Zoo will lose panda in 2010 .
