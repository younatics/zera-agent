A range of dolls have been created to help children of African origin to stay in touch with their heritage. The dolls were created by Chris and Ada Ngoforo, from London, who were concerned their children did not know about their West African roots. They decided to take matters into their own hands and what started off as project to help their family, has now transformed into a business venture. Ama (left) is described as a 'bubbling dynamic girl' according to the company's website and speaks the Ghanaian languages of Twi, Ga, Ewe and Krobo while Nubya, (right) whose parents moved to London from Cape Town years before her birth, is programmed to speak Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, and Afrikaans . They have launched their own range of toys, called Rooti Dolls, which are programmed to speak in several native African languages. The couple have now made 12 dolls from different African countries. Chris Ngoforo told CNN: 'We observed that over 90 per cent of children born or living in the diaspora and millions in Africa do not speak or understand their mother tongues. 'Our research made us understand that the reason for this is not because our children don't want to learn their mother tongues, but more because there are not many essential tools that can easily be both educational and fun at the same time.' Shiroh (left), of Kenyan and Somali mixed origin can speak Swahili, Kikuyu and Luganda while Keza (right) has parents who originate from Zimbabwe and Zambia can speak Shona, Ndebele, Bemba, and Nyanja, according to the dolls' creators . Rooti Dolls was set up by Chris and Ada Ngoforo who were concerned their children were losing touch with their West African roots . Among the dolls is Nina, who can speak Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa and Ibibio and loves to watch 'Nollywood' - popular term for Nigerian movies. Then there is Ama, who dreams to be a doctor, and can speak the Ghanaian languages of Twi, Ga, Ewe and Krobo. The couple hope the dolls will breakdown stereotypes and provide a more accurate representation of black people. Debbie Behan Garrett, author of 'The Definitive Guide to Collecting Black Dolls', said: 'Today's black dolls have evolved from negative caricatures to play-scale representations of haute couture fashion models and other positive images of babies, toddlers and adult black people.'","Dolls created by Chris and Ada Ngoforo who felt their children did not know enough about their roots .

'As a ginger myself, what initially interested me was the beautiful, romantic colour-palette of a ginger person and all that it connotes,' Ms Pokroy said.

As her work progressed she began to arrange the 'gingers' into a more sophisticated classification system, with colour divisions including copper, burnt orange, light orange and auburn.

A promising jockey took a dramatic tumble at Cheltenham today when she was thrown off her horse, moments ahead of winning the race. Jane Mangan, 19, had jumped the final fence on Oscar . Delta and was powering to the winning post when . the horse jinked to the left, sending the her tumbling to the ground. The Irish amateur rider appeared uninjured and quickly got to her feet clutching her helmet in disappointment. So far so good: Oscar Delta looked unbeatable approaching the line... ... but after jinking to the left he collided with the rail and there was no way back for Jane Mangan.... ...and it was left to Salsify to claim the honours . Recovering after her fall Miss Mangan compared her fall to a 'Disney film'. 'When I hit the ground I thought I was dreaming. He jinked to the left . thinking he had to go round for another circuit. I corrected him but I . was not ready for that and that was my fault.' The promising teen also recognised . that losing a race paled into significance beside the injuries suffered . by fellow amateur JT McNamara on Thursday. The 37-year-old fractured two . vertebrae in his neck when seriously injured in a fall on the third day . of the Cheltenham Festival. 'It could be a lot worse,' Miss Mangan said. 'We are all in pieces about what has happened to Massa (JT McNamara).' Hot prospect: Although today's fall hurt her pride, Jane Mangan is tipped for big things . 'She has hurt only her pride,' her father Jimmy said after the race. 'She's 100 per cent. She gave the horse a brilliant ride. I could not be more . proud of her.' Jimmy Mangan, who trained Monty's Pass to Grand National success, was heard talking to his daughter on the track. 'Pull yourself together, you could be like JT.' The dramatic fall of Miss Mangan left favourite horse Salsify on his own for a facile second success in a row in the Foxhunters' Chase, known as the amateurs' Gold Cup. Jockey Barry Geraghty watched Miss Mangan's fall in amazement as he rode Salsify to victory. Speaking after the race he said that although it was  the biggest day of his career, his thoughts were with friend McNamara. 'I just wish it were a happier day because we are all very upset about John Thomas,' Geraghty said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:31 EST, 15 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:33 EST, 15 March 2013 . Dead: Ieng Sary, number three in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy, has died in Phnom Penh aged 87 . One of the leaders of Cambodia's brutal communist Khmer Rouge regime has died aged 87 before he could be brought to justice for his crimes against humanity. Ieng Sary was on trial for causing the deaths of 1.7million people in association with his brother-in-law Pol Pot, one of the most bloodthirsty dictators of the 20th century. His death has raised fears that the two remaining defendants in the special Khmer Rouge tribunal might not survive until a verdict is reached, meaning that no one will be prosecuted for the reign of terror which engulfed the south-east Asian country in the 1970s. Ieng Sary died of cardiac failure yesterday in the capital, Phnom Penh. He had suffered from high blood pressure and heart problems and had been admitted to hospital on March 4 with weakness and severe fatigue. His body was taken from the hospital to Malai in western Cambodia, a former Khmer Rouge stronghold where his family lives, for his funeral. There are fears that the two remaining former Khmer Rouge leaders still on trial, both in their 80s, could also die before justice is served. Ieng Sary's wife, former Social Affairs Minister Ieng Thirith, was also charged but was ruled unfit to stand trial last year because she suffers from dementia. 'We are disappointed that we could not complete the proceeding against Ieng Sary,' tribunal spokesman Lars Olsen said, adding that the case against chief Khmer Rouge ideologist Nuon Chea and former head of state Khieu Samphan would not be affected. Corpse: Ieng Sary's death has raised fears that no Khmer Rouge figures will be brought to justice . Family: The dead man surrounded by relatives in Malai, a former Khmer Rouge stronghold in the north-west . Funeral: A Buddhist monk covers up the dead man's during a religious ceremony . Powerful: Ieng Sary was the foreign minister during the brutal communist regime in the 1970s . Monsters: Ieng Sary in 1970 shaking hands with Mao Zedong while Pol Pot looks on in the background . Ieng Sary founded the Khmer Rouge with Pol Pot. The regime, which ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, claimed it was building a pure socialist society by evicting people from cities to work in labour camps in the countryside. Its radical policies led to the deaths of an estimated 1.7million people from starvation, disease, overwork and execution. 'He was a critical part of the senior leadership and his death undoubtedly will have an impact on the case,' said Elizabeth Becker, a journalist and historian. 'This trial was held 30 years too late.' Ieng Sary was foreign minister in the regime, and as its top diplomat became a more recognisable figure internationally than his secretive colleagues. The Khmer Rouge came to power through a civil war that toppled a U.S.-backed government. Ieng Sary then helped persuade hundreds of Cambodian intellectuals to return home from overseas to help the new regime. The returnees were arrested and put in 're-education camps,' and most were later executed. In exile: Ieng Sary, right, in the Khmer Rouge stronghold of Dong Rek after the regime was deposed . Rehabilitated: Ieng Sary with Cambodia's prime minister in 1996, the year he was pardoned by the King . Free: In 1999 Ieng Sary thought he would escape trial but he was arrested again in 2007 . As a member of the Khmer Rouge's central and standing committee, Ieng Sary 'repeatedly and publicly encouraged, and also facilitated, arrests and executions within his Foreign Ministry and throughout Cambodia,' scholar Steve Heder said. Known by his revolutionary alias, 'Comrade Van', Ieng Sary was a recipient of many internal Khmer Rouge documents detailing torture and mass execution of suspected internal enemies, according to the Documentation Center of Cambodia. 'We are continuing to wipe out remaining [internal enemies] gradually, no matter if they are opposed to our revolution overtly or covertly,' read a cable sent to him in 1978, proving he knew about the purges . In 1996, years after the overthrown Khmer Rouge retreated to the jungle, Ieng Sary became the first member of its inner circle to surrender, bringing thousands of foot soldiers with him and hastening the movement's final disintegration. 'He liked good food, power, money, nice living, and the idea - mistaken - that communism was the wave of the future,' said David Chandler, a Cambodia expert at Australia's Monash University. 'He was a wily and able foreign minister. He quit when the quitting was good.' In the dock: The defendant in the UN-backed genocide trial in Phnom Penh . Victims: The graves of casualties of Khmer Rouge violence at the genocide museum in Phnom Penh . Ieng Sary's surrender secured him a limited amnesty, temporary credibility as a peacemaker and years of comfortable living in Cambodia, but that vanished as the UN-backed tribunal built its case against him. Ieng Sary was arrested in 2007, and the trial against him started in late 2011. He faced charges that included crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. He has denied any hand in the atrocities. At a news conference following his surrender, he said Pol Pot 'was the sole and supreme architect of the party's line, strategy and tactics.' 'Nuon Chea implemented all Pol Pot's decisions to torture and execute those who expressed opposite opinions and those they hated, like intellectuals,' Ieng Sary said. He claimed that he was a secondary figure excluded from Pol Pot's secret security committee, which decided policy and who would be executed. 'Do I have remorse? No,' he said in 1996. 'I have no regrets because this was not my responsibility.' Hospital: The facility in the Cambodian capital where Ieng Sary died on Thursday at the age of 87 . Going home: The former minister's body being transported from Phnom Penh to his ancestral village . Only one former Khmer Rouge official has been tried and convicted: former prison chief Kaing Guek Eav, who was sentenced to life in prison. Prime Minister Hun Sen has openly opposed additional indictments of former Khmer Rouge figures, some of whom have become his political allies. Pol Pot himself died in 1998 in Cambodia's jungles while a prisoner of his own comrades. Ieng Sary sought to have the tribunal honour the pardon he received from Cambodia's king when he surrendered in 1996. Ieng Sary was born Kim Trang on October 24, 1925, in southern Vietnam. In the early 1950s, he was among many Cambodian students who received government scholarships to study in France, where he took part in a Marxist circle. After returning to Cambodia in 1957, he taught history at an elite high school in Phnom Penh while engaging in clandestine communist activities. He, Ieng Thirith, Pol Pot and Pol Pot's wife eventually formed the core of the Khmer Rouge movement. Pol Pot's wife, Khieu Ponnary, was also Ieng Thirith's sister; she died in 2003. Pol Pot was known as 'Brother No. 1', Nuon Chea as 'Brother No. 2' and Ieng Sary was 'Brother No. 3'. In August 1979, eight months after the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge by a Vietnam-led resistance, Ieng Sary was sentenced in absentia to death by a government made up of Khmer Rouge defectors such as Hun Sen, the current prime minister. The show trial also condemned Pol Pot. Since he was in charge of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla movement's finances, Ieng Sary was believed to have used his position to amass personal wealth. On August 8, 1996, a Khmer Rouge rebel radio broadcast announced a death sentence against him for embezzling millions of dollars that reportedly came from the group's logging and gem business along the border with Thailand. But the charge appeared to be politically inspired because he was becoming estranged from his comrades. He struck a peace deal with Hun Sen and days later led a mutiny of thousands of Khmer Rouge fighters to join the government, which was a prelude to the movement's total collapse in 1999. As a reward, Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia almost unchallenged for the last two decades, secured a royal amnesty for Ieng Sary from then-King Norodom Sihanouk, who himself had been a virtual prisoner of the Khmer Rouge and lost more than a dozen children and relatives during its reign of terror. The government also awarded Ieng Sary a diplomatic passport for travel. Between his defection and arrest, Ieng Sary lived a comfortable life, dividing time between his opulent villa in Phnom Penh and his home in Pailin, a former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia.","Ieng Sary was on trial at international tribunal over his Khmer Rouge past .

It’s called PooPrints and the company markets to apartment complexes, condo buildings, and other communities where not-so-conscientious residents leave behind their pet’s waste.

Opinions of the service, which requires upfront fees from resident dog owners and sometimes monthly fees thereafter, aren’t all positive. Dallas tenant Brian Barcus told said he’s unhappy with his building’s decision to contract with PooPrints. ‘Everybody wants to live in a clean community,’ Barcus told the Houston Chronicle. ‘I can see the intent behind the new rule, but I don't understand how they can force it upon us in the middle of our lease.’ Barcus said it’s unfair that this new requirement comes after he unsuccessfully tried to break his lease following a burglary.

Her Oscar-winner husband Daniel Day-Lewis is notorious for immersing himself in his film roles both on and off the set. So when Rebecca Miller comes down to breakfast, she can never be sure who will be sitting across from her – a murderous oil tycoon, revered US president, villainous New York mobster, or even an IRA terrorist. Yet while many would find life as the wife of such an intense ‘method actor’ a challenge, novelist Miss Miller sees the benefits  in such a schizophrenic  environment, saying it has enhanced her writing. Novelist Miss Miller says that living with such an intense method actor has enhanced her writing . ‘I think it’s helped,’ she insists. ‘Writing is a lot about creating characters, inhabiting them.’ But, she adds, whereas her husband’s  personas are seen by many thousands of filmgoers, hers are ‘private, and people don’t get to see’ the creative process. Daniel Day-Lewis recently won his third Oscar, this time for his leading role in biopic Lincoln . Indeed, Day-Lewis, 55, praised his wife’s patience as he accepted his Best Actor Oscar last month for portraying Abraham Lincoln in Steven Spielberg’s historical drama. ‘Since we got married 16 years ago my wife Rebecca has lived with some very strange men,’ he said. ‘I mean they were strange as individuals and probably even stranger if taken as a group. But luckily she’s the versatile one in the family and she’s been the perfect companion to all of them.’ Miss Miller, 50, the daughter of playwright Arthur Miller, admits she has become accustomed to living with her husband’s film personas. ‘All his characters are wonderful to live with, in their own way,’ she says, adding wryly: ‘My favourite was Abe .  .  . because he filmed away from home, and I didn’t have to live with him.’ The couple split their time between Ireland and New York, living with their two sons, Ronan, 14, and Cashel, ten, and Day-Lewis’s 17-year-old son Gabriel by French actress Isabelle Adjani. And having the president for a husband and father was undoubtedly easier on the family than sharing their home with Daniel Plainview, the violent oil magnate in Day-Lewis’s 2007 drama There Will Be Blood. Day-Lewis is famous for his method acting, here as a murderous gangster in Gangs of New York . He has confessed: ‘They did go a  little bit crazy living with Plainview all the time, but the kids thought it was a laugh in the end to have this different bloke as their dad. My wife is amazingly tolerant. She just believes, like I do, that if you are attempting anything of a creative nature, no rules apply.’ Miss Miller’s latest novel Jacob’s Folly, about an 18th Century Parisian Jewish merchant who is reincarnated as a housefly in modern-day New York, was published in the US last week and comes to the UK in May.","Novelist Rebecca Miller says her husband's acting helps with her writing .

Dozens of Palestinian protesting against British policy have tried to attack a senior British diplomat while on a visit to a university today. The hostile demonstration forced the British consul general, Sir Vincent Fean, to cancel a speech at the Birzeit University near Ramallah. He was not hurt, although one demonstrator was seen kicking him in the shins. Student activists said they were protesting against decades of British policy supporting Israel over Palestinians. Mobbed: Palestinians students block the British consul general Sir Vincent Fean, pictured center wearing glasses, from giving a speech at the Birzeit University, near Ramallah, today . Palestinian university students surround British Consul General Sir Vincent Fean who was due to deliver a lecture at BirZeit University on Britain's policy in the Middle East . They said their chief grievance was over Britain's support for a Jewish homeland in what was at the time still Palestine. In 1917, Britain published the Balfour Declaration calling for 'the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people'. The letter also said 'nothing shall be done' that would prejudice the civil rights of non-Jews. Israel gained independence in 1948. Britain is an ally of Israel but has been highly critical of its policies toward the Palestinians, especially settlement construction in the West Bank. In recent days tensions have risen in the West Bank, with demonstrations, some of them violent, in solidarity with Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons. Some have predicted that the protests could escalate into a full-scale uprising. Unrest: Palestinian students hold placards and flags as they protest against the visit of British Consul-General Sir Vincent Fean to BirZeit University . Anger: British Consul-General Sir Vincent Fean, pictured second left, was not injured but a protester was seen to kick him in the shins . 'We asked the university to cancel his visit because Britain is the cause of the Palestinian tragedy,' said Taha Afghani, student leader of the Palestinian Fatah group, one of several political factions that organised the protest. Fatah is headed by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. The university's administration decided to . the cancel Sir Vincent's lecture after dozens of students, some waving . Palestinian flags and signs, gathered outside the office. Sir Vincent was returning to his vehicle after meeting Birzeit University officials when he was ambushed by protesters. The Foreign Office said that Sir Vincent had hoped 'to engage in an open dialogue' about Britain's policies in the Middle East. 'Sadly, such a dialogue was not possible on this occasion.' Birzeit University condemned the incident.

Princess Lilian of Sweden, wife of the late Prince Bertil, was buried in a state ceremony in Stockholm on Saturday. The Welsh-born beauty, who married into Sweden's royal family after a 33-year secret romance with her prince, was laid to rest in the royal cemetery in Haga on the outskirts of the Swedish capital. Princess Lilian died at the age of 97 as one of the most loved members of the royal family, despite three decades living hidden from the public. Lillian May Davies grew up in Swansea in Wales, the daughter of miner William Davies and Gladys Mary Curran, a shop assistant. She moved to London aged 16, and worked as a model and actress before the war, removing the second 'l' from her name to appear more glamorous. In 1940, at the height of the Blitz, she married Scottish actor Ian Craig shortly before he was called into the military. Three years later she was working in a factory, making radios for the Marines, and at a hospital for injured soldiers in the capital. Shortly before her 28th birthday she threw a cocktail party to celebrate her big day. One of the guests was a handsome Swedish naval attaché - Prince Bertil. When her husband returned from service in 1945 - in love with an Italian woman - the pair amicably divorced and Lilian moved to Sweden. Prince Bertil and Princess Lilian lived together for more than three decades before they were allowed to marry in 1976. When Lilian divorced in 1945, the beauty and her playboy prince were set to marry upon her arrival in Sweden, but disaster struck. Bertil's brother Gustav Adolf, Sweden's heir to the . throne, died in a plane crash in 1947, leaving his infant son Crown Prince Carl Gustaf next in line to wear the crown. With an elderly monarch and a toddler crown prince, the possibility that Bertil would have to act as monarch until Crown Prince Carl Gustaf came of age became a reality. Bertil was simply told a marriage to a commoner and divorcee, which would see him waive his right to the throne, was not on the cards. Honoured: Members of the Royal Guard carry the coffin of Princess Lilian out of the Royal Chapel at the Royal Palace of Stockholm . Loved: Princess Lilian was one of the most popular member of the Swedish Royal family and was given a state funeral today . Our Princess: A little girl was among the hundreds of people who gathered behind the Honour Guards to watch the procession after the funeral service for British-born Princess Lilian outside the Royal Palace . Together forever: Princess Lilian will be laid to rest next to Prince Bertil - the man she loved in secret for 33 years . Bertil's other older brother Sigvard . had already waived his right to the throne by marrying a commoner, . leaving Bertil and Lilian with no choice. For the next 33 years Lilian lived . hidden from the public, very few knew she even existed. The Swedish . Royal family made a deal with the press not to mention her name, and she . was not allowed to accompany Prince Bertil on any official duties. On her 80th birthday in 1995, she said: . 'If I were to sum up my life, everything has been about my love... He's a . great man, and I love him.' King Carl XVI Gustaf ascended the Swedish . throne in 1973 and after his marriage in 1976 to commoner Silvia . Sommerlath, Lilian and Bertil could finally become an official couple. Their wedding took place just months after the King and Queen's, in December 1976. Enchanting love story: Lilian and Prince Bertil in 1953, ten years after5 they fell head over heels for each other in London, yet another 23 before they would marry . Enduring love: Prince Bertil and Lilian in October 15, 1976, shortly after their engagement had been announced . Prince Bertil kept his title and the miner's daughter from Wales became a princess. 'We only regret one thing,' Prince . Bertil said after the wedding,' And that is that we were not able to get . married sooner and have children.' Despite never having any of her own, Lilian was very close to the royal children and Prince Carl Philip was her godson. Princess Lilian was active until just a few years before . death and, like her husband, had a keen interest in sports. When asked what the secret to her long . life was the great lover of practical jokes put it down to laughter, . rather than exercise.

She will now rest next to him at the . Royal Cemetery at Haga, Stockholm.

Technology companies see passwords as an outdated security risk as consumers often forget the increasingly complicated combinations and criminals break the codes . It's a bane of modern life remembering the myriad of passwords vital for everything from smartphones to bank accounts and online shopping. This tedious task, however, is set to be a thing of the past as other methods are developed. These include using fingerprint, voice and facial recognition instead of passwords seen as an outdated security risk. Apple is among several companies preparing to turn to fingerprint recognition. It is said to be releasing a new iPhone allowing owners to identify themselves by pressing a finger onto the handset. The technology could eventually spread to allow access to bank accounts and email accounts. Google, maker of Android phones, is examining voice recognition, iris scanners, behavioural biometrics and heartbeat reading. Michael Barratt, head of security at PayPal, said: ‘It’s a case of looking beyond passwords and the best alternatives are provided by smartphones. ‘The general view is that Apple will launch a fingerprint-enabled iPhone before the end of the year. ‘The Android handset market intends to stay competitive so it’s highly likely there will be fingerprint and voice identification- enabled devices from them too in the near future.’ Apple has bought a firm forging ahead in fingerprint identification technology and has submitted a patent for a biometric sensor. Forward thinking: Apple is expected to release the iPhone 5S this summer followed by the iPhone 6 later in the year . Some smartphones already have voice . recognition software and around a fifth have facial ID capabilities, . including the Samsung Galaxy S III. Research into passwords by Microsoft . in 2007 suggested that the average person used 6.5 passwords for 25 . sites. The number will have increased massively since the study.’ Mr Barrett, whose firm handled . £95billion of transactions last year, claims this year is the beginning . of a new ‘experimentation phase’ for the next generation of smartphones. Apple has already bought a company which is a market leader in fingerprint identification technology. Shortly afterwards, it submitted a patent for a biometric sensor. The company is expected to release the iPhone 5S this summer followed by the iPhone 6 later in the year. An iWatch device is also rumoured to be in production. A number of smartphones have already introduced voice recognition software and around a fifth have facial recognition capabilities, including the Samsung Galaxy S III which allows the user to unlock the phone by looking at it. But critics point out that the rumoured methods may not work in certain situations. They say that voice recognition may not work in a bar or otherwise with background noise and fingerprint technology may not always work. Philip Hoyer, director of strategic solutions at HID Global which manufactures secure identity technology, said the only way round the problem was to combine methods. ‘If you’re trying to access your account in a noisy bar, instead of using voice recognition, you could switch to facial recognition using the phone’s video camera.’ Apple declined to comment.","Apple is preparing to abolish passwords in favour of fingerprint recognition .

Russia may shelve plans to send singer Sarah Brightman into orbit. It was announced last year that the 52-year-old soprano would go on a £30 million eight-day mission to the International Space Station. But yesterday the head of the Russian Space Agency said the planned schedule may change, requiring cosmonauts to spend a month in orbit. The longer stint would be unsuitable for tourists such as Lord Lloyd-Webber’s ex-wife, who has passed the necessary medical tests. ‘If it’s a monthly shift, then it will be staff cosmonauts performing short-term scientific research,’ said space chief Vladimir Popovkin. Some officials had complained Brightman’s flight was a publicity stunt. 'It is very likely that the singer . made an announcement about her possible trip to the International Space . Station in order to advertise the release of her new album and to stir . up interest in her world tour planned for next year,' the unnamed source . told Interfax news agency.

'It is not clear how the upcoming . three years, one of which the singer will spend in constant travelling . around the world, will affect her health,' one was quoted as saying. At the time her trip was announced, the Russian Space Agency had appeared enthusiastic about the planned mission. The former wife of Andrew Lloyd .

A woman Labour MP locked herself in a Commons lavatory and another MP claimed he had pebbles in his shoes – to help a bid by their party to force through tough new press curbs. West Ham MP Lyn Brown had to be summoned by a sword-wearing official – who knocked on the door of the loo and asked her to come out. Labour had been in danger of running out of time to table amendments to tomorrow’s Commons vote on state regulation of the press. Stalling: Labour MP Lyn Brown, left,  locked herself in a Commons lavatory in order to buy her party extra time to table its Leveson amendments, while Thomas Docherty, right, claimed he had a pebble in his shoe . Under Commons rules, the amendments need to be tabled when the House is sitting. But with just one minute to go before the Commons rose on Thursday, and with no sitting on Friday, Labour  realised they might be too late. With seconds to go before time ran out, Labour used an obscure Parliamentary timewasting device to force a vote on whether MPs should continue the Thursday sitting behind closed doors. As parliamentary sittings include the time it takes to vote, and each vote takes about 15 minutes, forcing the vote was designed to buy Labour vital extra minutes to table their Leveson amendments. The delay by Mrs Brown prevented Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans from declaring the vote completed and Labour officials had more time to put the finishing touches to their Leveson plan. Assistant Serjeant at Arms Bob Twigger, who carries a ceremonial sword, marched into the ‘Aye’ voting lobby, knocked on the door and demanded to know who was inside. Ms Brown was eventually persuaded to open the door and leave. But at this point, there was another delay when Labour MP Thomas Docherty claimed he had  a pebble in his shoe and took it off. Then he said he had a pebble in his other shoe. Ironically, fellow Labour MP Paul Flynn raised a point of order with Mr Evans to query why the vote was ‘taking an excessively long time’ and asked: ‘Are people playing games?’ One Conservative MP said: ‘Lyn Brown did not look ill to me. It was an outrageous abuse of Parliament.’ Out of time: Labour had been in danger of running out of time to table amendments to tomorrow's vote on state regulation of the press, file picture .","West Ham MP Lyn Brown had to be summoned by official .

Ray Winstone said that he had 'no regrets' over tax avoidance and might leave Britain to avoid being 'raped' by its high taxes. Winstone, 56, told students at the Oxford Union on Wednesday night: 'I did not pay taxes for 20 years. I got away with it.' The People reported that he confessed to them: 'I was spending more than what I was earning. But I was a young fella. I did not understand the tax law.' Revelations: Ray Winstone told Oxford University students that he got away with not paying taxes for 20 years . Winstone also told the students they did not need to be afraid of going bankrupt. 'All it means is, you can't have a business or a bank account. So f****** what? The second time they made me bankrupt, they did it for . £28,000, just to make an issue of it.' He said that after being plunged . into bankruptcy in the eighties he decided to 'knuckle down and go to work.' Tax rant: Ray Winstone with his daughter, actress Jaime Winstone, said that Britain was being 'raped' by high taxes . However, he is still keen to avoid paying the top rate of tax. His revelations at the Oxford Union followed his tax rant on radio . last week. It emerged that he was using a loophole to save . nearly £100,000 of income tax. He put nearly £350,000 of his £1.4million earnings for the year to April 2012 down as 'administrative expenses'. The actor, who is well-loved for films . such as Sexy Beast, Scum and Quadrophenia, reportedly paid . £265,379 in corporation tax through his firm Ray Winstone Ltd. By putting his tax affairs through a . company, he is able to pay corporation tax at a rate of 26 per cent . instead of at the higher income tax rate. Comedian Jimmy Carr recently backed down . after he was criticised for using legal loopholes to reduce his tax . bill, but Winstone discussed his opinions of the British tax system . frankly. Last week he told talkSPORT Radio that the taxman was ‘taking too much in exchange for too little. I love this country but I’ve had enough.' Winstone then threatened to leave the UK altogether to escape being 'raped' by taxes. This would put him in a similar situation to French film star Gerard Depardieu, who left France for similar reasons. Lucrative film career: Winstone starred in The Sweeney last year with Ben Drew, right . Depardieu had a public row with the French government over tax, accusing it of penalising success, and now has Russian citizenship, and an investment firm in Belgium to give him a lower tax bill. High earner Richard Branson has also waded in on the debate, but he does not believe anyone should be leaving Britain for tax reasons. Branson told the Telegraph: 'Actually, it is a very reasonable system, especially if you compare it to a country like France, where it is 80 per cent for some high earners.'","Winstone told Oxford University students: 'I did not pay taxes for 20 years'

Suspect: David Renz, 29, has been charged with murder, rape and kidnapping in connection to a deadly carjacking or a woman and her daughter . A man accused of killing a Syracuse woman and raping her 10-year-old daughter during a carjacking was beaten and suffered a broken nose on his first day in jail, authorities said. David Renz had a swollen face and tissues stuffed up both nostrils when he appeared in federal court Friday to face a probation violation charge. 'I have a broken nose,' he told his lawyer, according to The Post-Standard in Syracus. His attorneys, James Greenwald and Kenneth Moynihan, said Renz was assaulted by other inmates at the Onondaga County Justice Center, where he was taken following his arrest Thursday night. Sheriff Kevin Walsh told the newspaper he was looking into why Renz was put into a holding area with other prisoners - not the usual practice in holding someone facing such accusations. Walsh said Renz has been segregated from other prisoners and is being watched around the clock. 'We're dealing with a man who is innocent until proven guilty,' he said. 'He's got to be protected.' Renz was arraigned Friday morning at a court in East Syracuse on charges that he abducted the mother and daughter as they left a gymnastics class in the Syracuse suburb of Clay. Police said Renz raped the girl and stabbed the mother to death before fleeing into some woods. The 10-year-old girl escaped and was found by a passing motorist, who dialed 911. Renz was captured a short time later. He had been previously charged with having child . pornography cut an electronic monitoring device off his ankle before . carjacking a woman, fatally stabbing her and raping her 10-year-old . daughter. Renz abducted the school librarian . and her daughter as they left a gymnastics class at a mall in the . Syracuse suburb of Clay, about 150 miles west of Albany, on Thursday . night. Renz bound both victims, raped the girl and . drove a short distance to a spot where the girl escaped and was found by . a passing motorist, troopers said. The motorist told 911 dispatchers he saw a . man running away from the scene, allowing police to quickly send in . officers on the ground and a sheriff's helicopter in the air. Renz was . caught a short time later near a wooded area. They believe . Renz tied up the woman and the girl and then raped the 10-year-old in a . deserted area of the mall parking lot shortly before 9pm on March 14. It was unclear how the girl escaped or when her mother was killed, authorities said. Police . are still piecing together the timeline of the crime, but their best . guess is that after assaulting the girl, Renz drove down a nearby rural . road. That’s where they think the woman, 47, who worked at an elementary school, was stabbed to death. The . girl managed to escape the scene and run down the road and was aided by . a passing driver. The child's name has not been released. The girl sustained injuries from the attack and currently being treated at a hospital. Her mother died from multiple stab wounds. Suspect: New York State Police lead David Renz out of the North Syracuse state police barracks Friday, March 15, 2013. Renz, 29, abducted a school librarian and her daughter as they left a gymnastics class . Photos of Renz, too, are being withheld for fear they could ‘pollute the investigation,' New York State Police Captain Mark Lincoln said in a Friday morning press conference. ‘It’ll be released down the road,’ Captain Lincoln said. Police seem sure, however, that the suspect did not know the victims personally. Renz fled the scene on foot, into nearby woods, where he was apprehended by police without a struggle. The suspect was arraigned Friday on . murder, rape and kidnapping charges and was held without bail. The . lawyer assigned to his case, Ken Moynihan, didn't return a call seeking . comment. Renz appeared a his arraignment with a swollen face and a broken nose after being assaulted by inmates at the Onondaga County Justice Center, CNY Central reported. Following his court appearance, the 29-year-old suspect was returned to jail, but placed into protective custody. Renz is also being guarded for now, but he will not be transferred to a different facility. The 29-year-old had been charged in . January with possession of child pornography and allowed to remain free . under terms that included staying off the Internet and away from places . including schools, parks and arcades. He lost his job at a supermarket, . moved in with his mother and hadn't been able to find other work after . his arrest, according to court documents. According . to an FBI criminal complaint, agents who went to the North Syracuse . apartment where Renz was living in June found in his bedroom four . computers that he told them he used to view adult pornography. Agent . Alix Skelton said Renz eventually admitted using the Internet for the . past six years to download child porn to a drive on one of the machines, . which he turned over to the agents. Technicians determined in November . that it had an encrypted hard drive, and Skelton said Renz provided the . encryption key. Agents . reviewing the drive in December found about 100 gigabytes of child porn . comprising more than 500 videos and more than 3,000 images, according to . the complaint. Among the . images were two showing sex acts involving prepubescent girls, said . Skelton, a member of a unit that targets people involved in online . exploitation of children. Crime scene: New York State Police investigate a car involved in a fatal carjacking on Verplank Road, Clay, N.Y . Renz was charged on January 9 in federal court with possession of child pornography. On Jan. 29, a judge granted a prosecutor's request for an extension of the time required for grand jury action so investigators could continue going over 'numerous items of electric media' for additional evidence. Renz, who authorities said had no prior police record, was released after agreeing to stay at home at night with an electronic monitor and away from any place he might encounter children. But Renz removed the monitor, Executive Assistant U.S. Attorney John Duncan said. Federal probation officials were investigating what happened, including whether Renz was able to get around an alert that is supposed to go off if the ankle bracelet is removed, he said. Late Friday afternoon, state police turned Renz over to federal authorities, who will hold him for violating the terms of his release, court documents said. Duncan said the cases against him will continue in federal and state courts. In an interview with Syracuse.com Friday, a former manager and trainer of David Renz described him as a courteous and intelligent employee who had worked at the James Street Wegmans since his teens. The manager recalled that the 29-year-old was always willing to help customers and was 'trusted' by his superiors.","Suspect David J. Renz was charged on Friday with murder, rape and kidnapping .

"Chau Van didn't have a criminal record yet ended up being branded a fugitive . Friend alerted Mr Van to his being sought by police after picture featured on local TV news . Mr Van tried to clear his name but was arrested and locked up for 3 days . Lawsuit now filed against police, city and state officials . By . James Daniel . PUBLISHED: . 08:53 EST, 17 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:29 EST, 17 March 2013 . It's the one list you hope to never to end up on, but for a California man just getting taking off was an ordeal in itself. Chau Van, 37, claims he was wrongly put on the Oakland Police Department's ""Most Wanted"" list for six months in 2012. He described the experience as 'an egregious and scandalous error'. Most wanted: Chau Van, 37, was only alerted to the fact he was on Oakland's 'most wanted' list after a friend saw a news report stating he was wanted for his part in a gangland shooting . Mr Van's photo and name were placed on a list of the city's four most wanted suspects by Police Chief Howard Jordan during a news conference about gang violence in February 2012. A report on the local evening news stated that he was a gang member who was wanted in connection with the shooting and was one of Oakland's most wanted criminals. He only learned of the error when a friend called him up to tell him about his new unwarranted title. Mr Van went along to a police station to tell them about the error and to clear his name but instead he was searched, arrested and locked up for three days before he was released . Getting the word out: Police Chief Howard Jordan announced Chau Van's name during a news conference about gang violence in February 2012 . Which is it? Initially Mr Van was wanted in connection with a shooting, then police wanted to speak with him over a charge of assault with a deadly weapon . Filed: The claims in the suit include violation of the constitutional right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures, defamation, false arrest and imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence . A few days later the police . announced that Mr Van - one of Oakland's most wanted felons -  was now . off the streets and had surrendered because of media pressure. This time cops announced the fugitive had been wanted for assault with a deadly weapon instead of a shooting. Mr Van was never charged and he assumed that as a matter of course his name would be removed from the list. It did not happen until he sent the police department a letter stating his demands six months later. Mr Van is now suing the city and the . Chief of Police. His lawsuit states that as 'a law-abiding citizen with . no history of violence' his reputation was 'irreparably harmed'. DeWitt . Lacy, Mr Van's lawyer, said in order to restore Mr Van's reputation . there would bee to be public acknowledgement of the alleged error along . with the removal of Mr Van's name from the federal and state 'most . wanted' lists. The lawsuit also aims to obtain some financial compensation to make up for lost employment and emotional trauma. Speaking . to KTVU Mr Lacy said :'It put a great amount of fear on him and his . family. He was wounded and he needs to be made whole.' Lawsuit: Chau Van, left, and his attorney, DeWitt Lacy, have now filed a lawsuit against the city and state officials. He is also seeking financial compensation . Stopping by: Chau Van went to speak to officers from Oakland Police department to clear his name. He ended up being arrested and locked in a cell for three days . Mr Van said that he has had to move house three times since his photo was made public and he is unable to find a job as a web designer or real estate agent. Lawyers from the City of Oakland and the police department have not commented on Mr Van's claims.","Chau Van didn't have a criminal record yet ended up being branded a fugitive .

"By . Thomas Durante and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:57 EST, 19 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:58 EST, 19 March 2013 . Would-be killer: UCF student James Oliver Seevakumaran was planning a campus killing spree before killing himself, cops said . A student at the University of Central Florida student has been hailed a hero for his role in preventing a mass shooting by his roommate, who killed himself instead of putting his plan into action. Arabo 'BK' Babakhani says that he was the man who called 911 to report a gunman in a dorm room after his roommate, James Oliver Seevakumaran had just pulled a fire alarm, and raised a gun to Babakhani's face just after midnight on Monday. At a press conference on Monday evening, UCF Police Chief Richard Beary said that Babakhani's call, combined with the quick response time of UCF officers, 'may have changed [Seevakumaran's] ability to think quickly on his feet.' Pulling the fire alarm was the first step of an elaborate campus massacre plot by Seevakumaran, police have said, but as officers approached, he shot himself in the head in his bedroom. There, cops found Seevakumaran's body, two guns, hundreds of rounds of ammunition and a backpack filled with improvised explosives. Babakhani told the UCF student newspaper Knightly News that he darted into his bedroom and called 911. He told the paper: 'I got away from the door in case he barred into it. I crouched in front of my chair in case he fired into the door. I crouched in front of my chest of [drawers] in case he fired into a wall... I just didnt know where he was gonna fire.'

Shooting: University of Central Florida police block off a street near the Tower 1 dorm after explosive devices were found while investigating a suicide in the dorm . Babakhani also described Seevakumaran as a loner, and said isn't sure he and his roommate ever locked eyes before pointing an assault rifle at him. He told the paper: 'I don’t know if he’s got any family. I've never heard him talk on his cell phone or I don't know if he’s got any family. I don’t know if he’s got any friends cause I've never seen them.' Babakhani added in the interview: 'For Thanksgiving... he didn't invite anyone. He just cooked a whole Thanksgiving meal for himself.' Plotter: Seevakumaran's roommate described the 30-year-old as a loner, who once cooked an entire Thanksgiving meal for himself . As police investigated, they found writings in Seevakumaran's room that detailed a plan of attack. A list found along with his dead body included getting drunk at a bar near campus before pulling the fire alarm. Beary says the final item was 'give them hell.' About 500 students were evacuated from the dorm on the Orlando campus after the fire alarm was pulled at about 12:21am, Beary said. Beary added that Seevakumaran had not . yet paid his school fees for this semester, and a process had begun to . kick him out of the dorm. He . had no prior disciplinary record at UCF, but he was arrested in 2006 . for misuse of a temporary tag and driving with a suspended license. His . writings indicated that he had been planning the attack since February, . and he had bought his weapons in an Orlando-area gunshop, police said. More details emerged Tuesday about Seevakumaran's solitary lifestyle. Seevakumaran's family said he was a loner who didn't have a history of violence in a brief statement released by authorities. Beary told the news conference that he acted alone and didn't have any friends. 'He didn't like to talk to people,' Beary said. UCF spokesman Grant Heston . said the Orange County Sheriff's Office and the FBI are helping with the investigation.

Grisly scene: Arriving officers found a student dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside a residence at the Tower 1 dorm . Investigation: About 500 students were evacuated from the dorm as police examined the explosives found inside . Just after noon on Monday, the explosives were removed from the dorm and classes resumed as scheduled. The school utilized text message alerts to keep students informed about the situation. Scare: Students were evacuated from the tower and moved to an open area about 1,000 feet from the UCF Arena . Antonio Whitehead, 21, a junior from . Hollywood, Florida, said he heard the fire alarm go off after midnight . and thought it was a routine alarm. He headed outside where he saw a crowd already heading across the street from the dorm. 'All . of a sudden, I felt the crowd move a little faster. And a police . officer with a machine gun or something told everyone to start moving a . lot faster,' he said. Whitehead, who has lived in the dorm . for two years, said the students were moved to an open area about 1,000 . feet from UCF Arena. Grant . Hernandez, 20, a sophomore from Orlando who also is a resident at the . dorm, said he woke up sometime after midnight when police were . evacuating the building. 'We weren't allowed to get our cars. We weren't allowed to get our personal effects,' Hernandez said. 'All we saw were people running, and they were not telling us what was going on,' he added. 'We were left unsure of things. It wasn't till about 6 o'clock that we got more information and a clearer picture of what was going on.' He said officers on the scene began providing more information, and students checked updates on the university's website. The area is a very busy section of the campus, with restaurants and shops nearby. A statement on the university's website said the UCF Arena would open to accommodate displaced students.

A grandmother who is 'trapped in World War Two' after a police car ploughed into her garden plans to sue the Metropolitan Police. The family of Eileen Lee, 76, said she now crouches on the ground with her hands over her head when she hears a loud noise and repeatedly shouts: 'Run for cover, the bombs are dropping'. They say she has suffered recurring flashbacks of bomb attacks since the police car hit her fence in Kirkdale, Sydenham, south London. The family of Eileen Lee, pictured with dog Coco, say she has been 'trapped in World War Two' since the crash and they are now suing the Metropolitan Police . The police car was about to set off in pursuit of a motorcyclist when it overturned and hit the pensioner's fence . The grandmother-of-two survived a Second World War bomb as a child that destroyed her family's Bromley home. Her daughter Maxine, 49, says her mother, who was only three and four years old during The Blitz, has been thrown into a 1940s time warp. She said she was fine before the crash on August 22, last year, but has since been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress and spent Christmas in a psychiatric ward at Bethlem Royal Hospital in Beckenham. Ms Lee said the trauma has left her mother 'just wanting to die'. The grandmother believed the noise of the crash was the sound of bombs . Post-traumatic stress disorder is a disabling anxiety disorder triggered by a traumatic experience that can range from a single incident to chronic stress, such as warfare. Stressful or frightening events such as serious road accidents, terrorist attacks, military combat, assaults or natural disasters can cause PTSD. Symptoms of sufferers can include nightmares or flashbacks to the traumatic event or problems sleeping or concentrating that affect daily life. The disorder may develop almost immediately or take weeks, months or years to take hold. Patients are commonly treated with supportive therapies, including antipsychotics, antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, and psychotherapy. The NHS says that PTSD affects up to 30 per cent of people who experience a traumatic event. Ten per cent of women and five per cent of men will be affected at some point in their life. She said: 'Her mental health has further deteriorated on a massive scale. 'She's terrible. I haven't got a mum any more. I've lost her. Since that night she doesn't go out, she doesn't dress. 'It's very, very sad that our united family has come to this.' The police car was about to pursue a motorbike on her road but crashed and overturned into her garden. The pensioner was watching television and had let her Pomeranian dog Coco into the back garden minutes earlier. Ms Lee said: 'Any loud bangs, any noise outside, she's just petrified. She still doesn't sleep.' She said her mother is now extremely depressed, according to her daughter, and has suicidal thoughts. The family say they have struggled to find a lawyer to represent them as they were denied legal aid, which they blamed on upcoming cutbacks. But they have now secured a lawyer who will represent the family on a 'no win no fee' basis although they have not yet filed a writ. Ms Lee said: 'I consider that my mum's plight is a matter of major public concern.' A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'A thorough investigation is taking place and it has not yet concluded so it will be inappropriate for us to discuss it at this time.'","Eileen Lee suffered post-traumatic stress after the police car crash .

The Conservatives were tonight seeking a last-minute agreement on press regulation ahead of a crunch Commons vote. Chancellor George Osborne said this morning that he hoped a last-minute deal could still be found and warned a regulatory system that did not have cross-party support might not last. And tonight Culture Secretary Maria Miller suggested that the three political parties may be closer to a compromise. Getting nearer: Culture secretary Maria Miller suggested that the three political parties may be closer to a compromise on press regulation . Rival proposals for a new system of . newspaper self-regulation will face judgment tomorrow in a high-stakes . battle over the response to the phone-hacking scandal. Ms Miller told Sky News: 'We're very clear . that we don't want to see statutory regulation of the press in this . country - we think it would have a chilling effect on journalism. 'I hope that the discussions that we have over the next 24 hours can . really make sure that we come together and have a real solution here. 'I think there's been compromise on both sides to make the Leveson . report work in practice. We're still in the position where the Labour . party have put forward a statutory regulation of the press. 'We want to take the discussion to Parliament and I think we can make a . very strong case that the royal charter proposals are the right way . forward.' Crunch time: Chancellor George Osborne (pictured on today's Andrew Marr Show) said he hoped a last-minute deal could still be found and warned a system that did not have cross-party support might not last . Her comments came after Mr Osborne told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: ‘We want to make sure we have a system of press regulation that prevents the abuses we saw in the past happening again, but also makes sure we have a free press. ‘That is such a precious thing: people fought - and literally died - to give us a free press. The Prime Minister has already achieved a huge amount in protecting a free press from those who want to undermine it. 'I hope that the discussions that we have over the next 24 hours can really make sure that we come together and have a real solution here' Culture secretary Maria Miller . ‘I would say it would be great on Monday if we can get some kind of agreement, even at this late stage, between the parties. ‘Because, frankly, I think press regulation which is achieved in a way which divides the political parties is not press regulation that is really going to last, and it is not going to be a press regulation which is deeply-rooted in our culture. ‘There is still an opportunity for us to get together and get a press law that works. Ultimately we are not about grandstanding on this; we are about getting a press law that works.’ In a reversal of the Westminster status quo, Labour and the Liberal Democrats are lining up against the Conservatives in a coalition for a tougher regime. Disagreements: The Lib/Lab plan involves underpinning a system in legislation, something which has been opposed by Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured) as a risk to press freedom . Both sides propose using a royal charter to create a new watchdog body in response to the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry into abuses by the press. But the Lib/Lab version involves underpinning the system in legislation, something which has been opposed by Prime Minister David Cameron as a risk to press freedom. 'I think press regulation which is achieved in a way which divides the political parties is not press regulation that is really going to last, and it is not going to be a press regulation which is deeply-rooted in our culture' Chancellor George Osborne . It also rules out a veto for the press over the membership of the watchdog and gives the regulator the power to enforce the publication of prominent apologies. Mr Cameron - who dramatically pulled the plug on cross-party talks on Thursday - has said he will abide by the will of parliament. Without an overall Commons majority, allies accept he is unlikely to win sufficient support for using the threat of punitive damages against non-participants to persuade papers to sign up. Despite efforts to shore up the vote - including bringing a minister back from Japan - a number of Tories are expected to back the Lib/Lab proposals. Campaigning: Ed Miliband urged MPs to 'stand up for the victims' of press abuse by enshrining a new press regulator . Mr Cameron insists his proposal is ‘the fastest possible way to deliver the strong self-regulation body that Leveson proposed that can put in place million-pound fines, prominent apologies and get justice for victims in this country’. However he yesterday indicated that he did not consider the Lib/Lab proposed statutory underpinning ‘a big issue of principle’ and said he was ‘confident about the future’. 'Monday is the day that politics has got to do the duty by the victims and has got to stand up for the victims' Labour leader Ed Miliband . ‘We're now in sight of getting that regulator with million pound fines and proper regulation in our country,’ he said. ‘The idea of a law, a great big all singing, all dancing media law that would have been bad for press freedom, bad for individual freedom - that's off the table.’ He insisted he too was acting as ‘a friend of the victims’ of phone hacking. Meanwhile Labour leader Ed Miliband urged MPs to ‘stand up for the victims’ of press abuse by enshrining a new press regulator. ‘Monday is the day that politics has got to do the duty by the victims and has got to stand up for the victims,’ he told the Observer. Opinions: Actor Hugh Grant, who fronts the Hacked Off campaign, said victims would support the Lib/Lab package even though a royal charter was not ideal and enacts Leveson only 'reasonably well' ‘I think it is an important moment because we have had decades of failing to ensure that we have a system of press complaints and redress which means that ordinary people aren't left at the whim of a sometimes abusive press.’ But Mr Miliband said all politicians now needed to follow their instincts about what was right. There was criticism of the failure to incorporate fully Lord Justice Leveson's proposals from the parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Actor Hugh Grant, who fronts the Hacked Off campaign, said victims such as the Dowlers would support the Lib/Lab package even though a royal charter was not ideal and enacts Leveson only ‘reasonably well’. He insisted there were ‘gigantic differences’ with the Prime Minister's scheme, which was ‘cunningly designed’ to return to the previous discredited system. ‘It was never ideal that this would be done by royal charter. That seemed to us strange to haul this medieval instrument out of history,’ he told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show. ‘But the important victims of this - I do not include people like myself, I am talking about people like the Dowlers etc - would be supportive of it, yes. ‘MPs promised victims to do right by them and they have that chance on Monday.’ The actor confirmed that he personally called members of the shadow cabinet last week to warn them not to settle ‘much too early’ amid signs of cross-party agreement. Unimpressed: Author JK Rowling said victims had been 'hung out to dry' by Mr Cameron and urged Labour and the Liberal Democrats to 'have the courage' to protect them . But he dismissed the idea that Hacked Off was a ‘smooth sinister operation’ - mocking his colleagues such as ex-MP Evan Harris and director Professor Brian Cathcart. Mr Grant said: ‘It's a few dandruffy professors sitting in a cheap office with a slightly insane, chess champion ex-Lib Dem MP and a couple of threadbare lawyers and me.’ Shadow culture secretary Harriet Harman said Labour was talking to ‘many’ Tory MPs it hoped to join it - but held out the prospect of Mr Cameron avoiding defeat by doing a deal. There were ‘just a few issues’ remaining between the two sides - with the ‘substantive’ ones being the powers to force prominent apologies and the press veto over membership. ‘We've always said we would like to reach agreement and actually we could then come to the House of Commons with an agreed position and say 'yes, this is what we want,’ she told the Sky News Murnaghan programme. ‘There are just a few issues that remain between us, but they are quite important ones.’ Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes suggested between 20 and 60 Tory MPs could rebel and be joined by smaller parties - which would mean a very heavy defeat for Mr Cameron. ‘On our side of the argument there are Conservatives - up to 60 at the maximum but probably 20 core people. Hopeful: Shadow culture secretary Harriet Harman said Labour was talking to 'many' Tory MPs it hoped to join it - but held out the prospect of Mr Cameron avoiding defeat by doing a deal . ‘There are Irish parties, nationalist parties, the Green Party, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and possibly some Tories - now that's quite a big coalition.’ Author JK Rowling - who gave evidence to Leveson about press intrusion into her family's privacy - said victims had been ‘hung out to dry’ by Mr Cameron and urged Labour and the Liberal Democrats to ‘have the courage’ to protect them. She said she would not ‘support anything that hampers the press's ability to hold power to account’ but that the Leveson recommendations were ‘reasonable and proportionate’. Press Complaints Commission chairman Lord Hunt said major publishers were ready to sign up to a tough new ‘Leveson compliant’ watchdog but believed statutory underpinning would send a dangerous signal to the world about press freedom. He welcomed the parties' agreement on a royal charter and noted that Lord Justice Leveson concluded that ‘the last thing he wanted was statutory press regulation’. ‘All those that I have consulted who are the publishers, they have all agreed to have a new body and a fresh start - with teeth,’ he told Murnaghan. ‘Probably the strongest regulatory body in Europe: ability to fine; ability to carry out investigations. ‘They have all signed up to that and they just say “we don't need statute; the last thing we should do is send a message across the world that the UK now has a press law”.’","Maria Miller: 'I hope talks over next 24hrs can ensure we come together'

An immigration official at Colombo's international airport said that when the unnamed tourist was asked about a Buddha tattoo on his arm on Friday he had spoken 'very disrespectfully' about Buddhism. 'If he expressed such views after entering the country, it would have been a threat to his own safety,' an immigration official at Bandaranaike International Airport told local newspaper Lankadeepa Sinhalese.

Respect for Buddhism: Buddha is worshiped by the majority of Sinhalese people in Sri Lanka . Sri Lanka, a mainly Buddhist nation, is highly sensitive to perceived insults to the religion and there have been a number of incidents with tourist indiscretions recently . In February a tourist from Netherlands was arrested by police in Kandy, central Sri Lanka, for having a large tattoo of Buddha prominently on her back, Gossip Lanka News reported. She was fined and released after saying that she had not intended to cause offence. Last year three French tourists were given suspended prison sentences for taking photographs in which they pretended to kiss a statue of Buddha at a temple. The American rapper Akon also realised the offence he had caused when he was refused a visa in 2010 after protests over one of his music videos in which scantily-clad women danced in front of a Buddha statie.

More than 100,000 British citizens visited Sri Lanka in last year, accounting for 10% of the total number of tourists. The UK is also the country's second-largest trading partner after India. Sri Lanka is not the only country trying to impress upon tourists how offensive they find westerners getting Buddha tattoos as a fashion statement.

Najibullah Hashimi - whose father was murdered by the brutal Taliban regime - is set to be flown back to Afghanistan on Monday, despite achieving 13 GCSEs, settling down with a foster family and a girlfriend and becoming a pillar of his community. The aspiring teacher, aged just 18, today begged: 'This country gave me everything. 'It's my dream to give something back to this country and that's what I will lose if they send me back.' Desperate: Naj Hashimi will be deported back to Afghanistan, despite achieving 13 GCSEs and becoming a pillar of the community . The sixth form student, captain of his school cricket club and also a coach, is desperate to stay in the UK but his last-gasp appeals have failed and he is now locked up in an immigration removal centre.

With just hours to spare before the plane set to carry him back to his troubled  home country lifts off from British soil, the schoolboy issued a direct plea to Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May to review his case. The promising cricketer, known as Naj to his family and friends, said he was unable to face food at the centre in Dover ahead of his controversial deportation. An online petition to save the teenager from being deported has attracted hundreds of signatures . Naj said: 'I can't leave my family. I have a really good life here. 'I love my foster family. I have a nice girlfriend.' The teen, who is studying a sports diploma at Sittingbourne Community College in Kent and is a prominent member of his local cricket team, fled his war-ravaged homeland for Pakistan as a terrified 11-year-old alongside his mother after his father was brutally killed by the Taliban. At the age of 14 his widowed mother and uncle paid an agent to traffic him across Europe and into Britain, with Naj arriving in the country hidden on a lorry and unable to speak a word of English. He set about learning the language and within just two years had gained a remarkable 13 GCSEs. Naj, who speaks four languages, acts as a mentor to other Afghan boys in his school and dreams of settling in the UK permanently. Yet he is faced with the prospect of packing up his belongings and carrying a meagre 20 kilograms of luggage back to Afghanistan - a country where he no longer has friends or family. 'If I get out of the aeroplane I don't know where to go. I have made a life here. There, I have no one,' the youngster said today. Naj said he treated foster parents Steve and Michelle Griffiths as though they were his own family. 'They are like my own blood,' he said. 'I have got a family life here now and [the authorities] are sending me back to Afghanistan, which is going to be exactly the same situation I fled five years ago. 'I love my foster family and they love me.' The teenager fled war-torn Afghanistan and says he has no home or relatives to return to . Naj is due to celebrate his 19th birthday in a week's time, but faces the heartbreaking prospect of spending it thousands of miles apart from his girlfriend of a 16 months, Lucy Pearce. The youngster was arrested at Gravesend police station in Kent on March 5 and has been locked up ever since. Naj said his biological mother, now living in Pakistan, had been in tears on the phone when he told her he was facing a battle to remain in Britain. Naj's emotional foster dad Steve, an ex-fireman and former soldier, made a heartfelt plea to the Government to halt the youngster's deportation. Mr Griffiths said: 'I don't ask much of my country, except that it should now do the decent and honourable thing and let stay the boy I consider my real son, who everybody loves.' Mr Griffiths, 43, who has looked after him for the last two years, said that lost Naj's family had no option but to try to give him a better life outside the war-torn country. He said: 'Without being over-sentimental, he's the sort of son every foster parent wants - he's a credit to me and this country. But now we appear to have run out of legal options and perhaps only the PM can intervene. I hope it's not too late for him to act.' An online petition, 'Save Naj Hashimi', has received more than 1,00 signatures in the 48 hours since it was set up. A UK Border Agency spokesman said it was unable to comment on individual cases but added: 'The UK only returns individuals if both the UKBA and the courts are satisfied they do not need our protection and have no legal basis to remain in the country.

The top 10 conservative states all vote reliably Republican in national elections and are all located in the nation's Southern, Midwestern, and Mountain West regions. Wyoming and North Dakota were joint second on the list of most conservative states, followed by Mississippi, Utah, Oklahoma, Idaho, Louisiana, Nebraska, and Arkansas.

The voters, who are undecided over which of the two parties to vote for, also told the survey that Ukip's Nigel Farage is a better party leader than Prime Minister David Cameron by 37 to 32 per cent. The ‘switchers’ would prefer London Mayor Boris Johnson to Mr Cameron as Tory leader and would put Home Secretary Theresa May in third place, the ICM survey for The Sunday Telegraph said. Favourites: Voters who are undecided over which of the two parties to vote for told the survey that Ukip's Nigel Farage (left) is a better party leader than Prime Minister David Cameron (right) by 37 to 32 per cent . The findings come two weeks after Ukip pushed the Conservatives into an embarrassing third place in the by-election in Eastleigh, Hampshire, which was won by the Lib Dem candidate Mike Thornton. There are concerns within the Tory party that Ukip will split their vote at the local elections in May, which could result in a strong result for Labour and put even more pressure on Mr Cameron. But the poll revealed that Mr Cameron’s policy on holding an ‘in/out’ referendum on Britain's EU membership is favoured by all voters when compared to Ukip’s plan of leaving immediately. The ICM poll overall gave Labour a six-point lead on 36 per cent, with the Tories on 30 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 18 per cent, when asking voters to predict the next general election result.

When looking at government spending - covering health, pensioners and global aid - 64 per cent of ‘switchers’ favour Ukip’s policies, compared to just 28 per cent for the Tories.

Michael Atkinson, 64, was discharged from the Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester before being found by police tearful, frozen and wandering the streets more than half a mile away. He had hurt himself after he fell while he was lost and was ‘very distressed’ by his ordeal. He was also wearing a hospital wristband bearing the name and details of a two-year-old girl. Michael Atkinson, 64, was discharged from the troubled Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester before being found by police tearful, frozen and wandering the streets more than half a mile away . Earlier this month, Jonathan Hastilow-Sands, a 90-year-old Alzheimer’s sufferer, was reported missing from the same hospital. He was discovered in Bristol, 175 miles away. This week it was also revealed that an unnamed 76-year-old male patient walked more than a mile from the hospital in his pyjamas and dressing gown before he was stopped and taken in by a hairdresser. Hospital bosses have now launched a ‘full review’ into what happened to Mr Atkinson on March 6. His wife, Helen, who had been told her husband was being admitted to the hospital for a brain scan following a stroke, is also calling for action to be taken against the hospital for ‘negligence’. Mrs Atkinson, from Breightmet, Bolton, said: ‘When the police brought him back, he was in a terrible state. I was distraught and he was crying. He was like a bag of ice. It has made him worse. ‘Something is very wrong at that hospital. You don’t discharge a man in his state at 3.30am.’ Hospital bosses have now launched a 'full review' into what happened to Mr Atkinson on March 6 . She has told how she called the hospital to find out . why she had not been contacted to collect him and said she was told they . ‘couldn’t find my number in his notes’ and that her husband could not . remember his phone number. Mr Atkinson suffered a stroke in 2005 and has been taking morphine for a slipped disc that has trapped a nerve. He suffers from emphysema and lung disease and has had pneumonia three times. Mrs Atkinson said her husband had been due to be collected by an ambulance for a brain scan, following a possible second stroke, between 3.30pm and 7.30pm on March 5. However, an ambulance did not arrive at the couple’s home until 11.40pm that night. Mrs Atkinson said the ambulance staff did not know why they were collecting her husband and, when at the hospital, no scan was carried out. After her husband was brought home by police at 4.30am the next morning, the 64-year-old said she was ‘livid’. He was found without his coat, which had been a Christmas present, and was missing his medication. Mrs Atkinson believes if he had not been found he could have got hypothermia and died. Mr Atkinson was re-admitted to the Royal Bolton Hospital for treatment, but has since been discharged and is back at the couple’s home. His wife has complained to the hospital and has contacted solicitors. She said: ‘I am so upset that my poor husband has suffered for so long unnecessarily. It is disgusting. The hospital says that it is carrying out an investigation into what happened . ‘Every time I walked in there to go and see him I took notes because I don’t trust them.’ Heather Edwards, head of communications at Bolton NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘We are aware of Mrs Atkinson’s concerns and a full review is taking place to understand exactly what happened.’ Last year hospitals were told to end the ‘obviously unacceptable’ practice of sending elderly or vulnerable patients home in the middle of the night. Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of the NHS, ordered an urgent review of how the service is discharging hundreds of thousands of patients amid concerns some are being left to fend for themselves.

Police have passed a file to the Crown Prosecution Service after a Red Arrows aerial display team pilot died after he was ejected from his cockpit while on the ground. Lincolnshire Police confirmed they have handed over the file concerning the death of Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham. Iraq war veteran Flt Lt Cunningham, 35, was a highly-regarded and experienced pilot with the RAF's aerial display team but was fatally injured after being ejected from his Hawk T1 aircraft while on the ground at RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire, on November 8, 2011. Charges could be brought against the MoD after Iraq veteran Sean Cunningham was killed when he was ejected from his Hawk T1 . The parachute on the ejector seat did not deploy and the South African-born airman later died in hospital. Following the incident, the RAF grounded all non-essential flying of aircraft fitted with the Mk10 Martin Baker-built ejector seat 'as a precaution', but flights later resumed in December 2011, with air chiefs saying they had 'no remaining safety concerns'. A Lincolnshire Police spokesman said: 'A file has been submitted for consideration by the CPS and as soon as we're in a position to update on that, we will. 'We are not speculating on the matter of any possible offences.' Paramedics were called to the team's world-famous aerobatics base in Lincolnshire after the ejector seat in the Hawk T1 aircraft was deployed . The Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed it was aware a police file was now with the CPS but would not comment further . It is understood the police are expecting a response from the CPS by the end of the month on whether any criminal charges should be brought in relation to the incident. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed it was aware a police file was now with the CPS but would not comment further. An MoD spokesman said: 'We are aware that a referral has been made to the CPS in relation to the civil police investigation into this incident. 'It is not appropriate for the MoD to comment on such matters, any questions should be directed to the civil police and/or CPS. 'Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Flt Lt Sean Cunningham.' An inquest was told that Flt Lt Cunningham had completed ground safety checks when the ejector seat of his Hawk jet was deployed.

Blake Calverley, 18, has the same condition as former Bolton Wanderers’ player Fabrice Muamba. But a device wired a device to his heart -  that can be seen bulging from the left side of his chest  - that has already saved his life several times. It delivers a powerful shock without warning when his heart stops - something he describes as 'like a horse has kicked you in the chest'. Blake Calverley suffers from the same heart rhythm condition as footballer Fabrice Muamba . The teeanger, from Accrington, Lancashire, suffers from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the same condition which caused Bolton Wanderer Fabrice Muamba’s heart to stop for 78 minutes during an FA Cup tie. Doctors told him that without the machine, which measures around 12cm by 8cm, he would die. Blake will eventually need to have a heart transplant and is urging others to sign up to the organ transplant register. Despite having the device fitted, he says is too scared to even go out alone in case he takes a turn for the worst. Blake, who this week became a father to 9lb 13oz Logan, was diagnosed with the condition in January 2011. He was visiting the doctor for a regular diabetes check-up when the doctor became concerned as he had been suffering chest pains. He was told his heart condition had caused him to develop Danon Disease, also known as ‘the silent killer’ as most sufferers die from the condition in their sleep before being diagnosed. The disease weakens muscles and sufferers don’t usually live beyond the age of 19. In a bid to save him,  doctors fitted Blake with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) under his collar bone - the same device given to Muamba. The device releases an electrical charge if it detects a heart malfunction. Blake, with sister Sara Calvery and mother Wendy. The defibrillator has already saved his life several times . But 11-months later doctors at Royal Manchester Infirmary replaced the battery operated device with a SICD defibrillator, which is much stronger . His mother Dawn Calverley, 47, said: 'Doctors have told us Blake’s condition is incurable. 'The defibrillator gives us piece of mind that there is something to restart his heart if it randomly stops when no one is around. 'But he is still scared. He has even stopped leaving the house because he doesn’t want to get a shock when he is alone. It’s horrible not being able to make him well.' Blake, who dreams of becoming a professional chef, has been forced to give up playing football and riding his bike. He said: 'In a way I am scared of the thought of having a heart transplant. But if all goes well I have been told I will be able to play football again and get back to normal in general. 'I have been told my condition is going to be monitored over the next six months and if it continues to deteriorate I will be placed on the transplant list. 'This time in a year I could have a new heart.' Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition where the heart muscle becomes thickened. Around one in 5,000 people have the condition, and it most commonly develops during the teenage years or young adulthood. However, the symptoms vary depending on the severity. These include shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, dizziness and fainting attacks - most commonly during exercise. It can cause the heart muscle to become stiff, which means your left ventricle doesn't fill as easily as normal and less blood is then pumped out. It can also partially obstruct blood flow, which can make small blood clots more likely. In some people, the abnormal heart muscle affects the electrical conducting system of the heart. This may cause abnormal heart rates and rhythms to develop. Sudden collapse and death occurs in a small number of people with HCM. This is probably due to a severe arrhythmia which may develop suddenly . Most cases are hereditary so screening of close family members is advised.

Karen Perrement, 52, said her mother, Nell Perrement, 75, spent three months in hospital with severe dehydration and acute renal failure after the nightmare fortnight stay which cost £1,500. The mother-of-three has hit out at County Care Homes, which runs St Peter’s Residential Home in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, after they awarded her a settlement of £25,000 but did not admit liability. Nell Perrement was diagnosed with dementia aged 65. Her daughter said she looked like a 'living skeleton' after a fortnight stay at St Peter's Residential Home which she claims left her mother severely dehydrated . Nell Perrement was diagnosed with dementia aged 65. Her daughter said she looked like a ‘living skeleton’ after a fortnight stay at St Peter’s Residential Home which she claims left her severely dehydrated. Ms Perrement, of Claydon, near . Ipswich, said last night: ‘It was a very traumatic experience for her . and she has never really fully recovered. ‘She looked like a living skeleton. I will never get the answers I truly want from the care home.’ Mrs . Perrement went into respite care at privately-owned St Peter’s just . after Christmas 2009 to allow Karen and her three children to go away . for a few days. The grandmother was diagnosed with vascular dementia 10 years ago when she was just 65. But . Ms Perrement and her daughter Samantha, 23, were distressed . when they went to get widow Mrs Perrement to take her home . with them. Karen, a . charity worker, said: ‘She was no longer the mum I knew. She had lost a . lot of weight, she had black finger nails, her breathing was shallow . and she was very cold.’ They took Mrs Perrement, a mother-of-two, back home on January 13, 2010. Karen immediately called 999 because she feared for her mother’s life. After . being rushed to Ipswich Hospital, Mrs Perrement was diagnosed with . severe dehydration and acute renal failure. Karen was told to expect the . worst. ‘I was just in complete and utter shock and could not understand what had happened and gone so wrong,’ she said. Medical . reports show that Mrs Perrement received a staggering 20 litres of . rehydrating fluids during her first five days in hospital. Karen Perrement and her mother Nell were awarded £25,000 by County Care Homes, who did not accept liability . The weak pensioner was forced to stay in hospital for three months until she improved enough to go home. Ms Perrement, who as well as daughter . Samantha has two sons, Robert, 15, and Kered, 14, said: ‘This time when . mum came home it was as a completely different person. Vascular dementia is the second most common kind of dementia after Alzheimer's. The condition is caused by problems in the supply of blood to the brain. Typical symptoms of dementia include memory loss, physical weakness, . mood changes and problems with language, reasoning and decision making. Vascular dementia follows a stepped progression, with symptoms remaining . at a constant level for a time before suddenly deteriorating. ‘She . just isn’t there any more. Her eyes are dead, her hands are clenched, . she dribbles and she doesn’t laugh or respond to the TV or music. ‘Her happy dementia life has gone and she now looks frightened and traumatised. The stress and strain on us all is unbearable and we’re physically and emotionally drained.’ Ms Perrement made a formal complaint to the Care Quality Commission about the treatment her mother received at St Peter’s. The complaint was referred to Suffolk . County Council’s adult safeguarding team before Karen decided to seek . advice from Ipswich-based Gotelee Solicitors. ‘My mother didn’t deserve to be treated the way she was, especially when it cost £1,500 for the fortnight,’ said Karen. ‘It . was a very traumatic experience for her and she has never really fully . recovered. The care home was supposed to be protecting my mum and . clearly that didn’t happen.’ Karen . filed a claim against County Care Homes, which runs St Peter’s, for . breach of contract and/or negligence, injury and loss and damage. County Care Homes, which runs St Peter's Residential Home, paid out £25,000 but did not admit liability . Among the particulars listed were that Mrs Perrement was not provided with sufficient fluids and that staff failed to seek medical advice for her deteriorating condition, failed to admit her to hospital and failed to take adequate care of her. Ms Perrement settled a claim against County Care Homes for £25,000 in January. Ms Perrement said that crucial lessons need to be urgently learned from her mother’s terrible experience. ‘Something has got to be done. If you make a mistake you’ve got to put your hands up and deal with it,’ she insisted. ‘What is paramount is protecting these vulnerable adults.’ Gareth Nixon-Moss, director of County . Care Homes, said: ‘The home has been cleared of any neglect by all the . professional authorities and this matter was treated as a nuisance claim . to avoid legal fees without accepting liability whatsoever.’ Julie Bateman, Suffolk County Council’s assistant director with responsibility for adult safeguarding, said: ‘I would urge anyone with concerns about the quality of care a friend or relative is receiving to report them immediately. ‘We take matters relating to safeguarding extremely seriously and will investigate whenever concerns are raised. ‘In relation to this particular case, the safeguarding team carried out a thorough investigation and identified some areas where the home could improve. ‘These were discussed in detail with the home and they took the necessary steps to improve their practice.’","Nell Perrement, 75, was hospitalised with dehydration and renal failure .

A retired police inspector has helped  experts discover a new planet from the comfort of his armchair. Stargazer Roy Jackson, 71, began his hobby after retiring 15 years ago when he became fed up of daytime television. Mr Jackson, of Birtley, Gateshead, enrolled on a computer course at Gateshead College and now uses his technology skills to analyse the stars. Roy Jackson, 71, from Gateshead, and the laptop he used to help experts discover a new planet from the comfort of his armchair - now named by astronomers as 'PH2 b' His years of seaching the skies have paid off after he discovered the planet - now named by astronomers as 'PH2 b'. Mr Jackson said: 'There is nothing worth watching on the television and there's only so much gardening you can do and you have to have other things to fill your time in. 'I like the odd quiz show and Corrie but the rest of the soaps are a bit beyond me - they are just miserable. 'With astronomy you can see things you would never imagine like galaxies and star formations.' However, rather than park himself at the end of a telescope, Mr Jackson prefers to research in comfort and uses his computer to uncover the mysteries of space  whilst reclining in his armchair. Mr Jackson volunteered to analyse information for astronomers as part of 'The Planet Hunters' project set up by Oxford and Yale Universities, which asked for citizen scientists to spot patterns in celestial data. 'I don't have a telescope and I don't want one - I can do it all from the computer,' he said. Stargazer Roy Jackson, 71, from Gateshead, said his wife is still unimpressed after he helped experts discover a new planet from the comfort of his armchair - now named by astronomers as 'PH2 b' 'I don't want to sit outside in the cold when I can sit in the warmth and comfort of my own front room and look at the computer. 'I see things I could never see in the back garden with a telescope. 'The problem is, the astronomers have collected all of this data using satellites but they don't have the time or manpower to analyse it all, so they post their findings on a website and invite the public to highlight anything of interest.' The discovery of the planet is the first major find for Mr Jackson, who describes it as 'A little bit like winning the lottery.' Mr Jackson has been credited in a research paper which has been published online by the prestigious Astrophysical Journal, and is only one of a handful  of volunteers to do so.The planet PH2 b, orbits a sun-like star in the constellation Cygnus several hundred light years away. However, his wife remains unimpressed. Mr Jackson said: 'My wife Lilian isn't all that interested in the stars, she just lets me get on with it. 'But she did say I need a new bigger hat for my head swelling!' Mr Jackson is part of a team of international armchair stargazers who assist scientists analyzing outer space in their spare time. After joining Durham Constabulary as a PC, Mr Jackson worked his way up to become an inspector. Since retiring after 30 years of service, star gazing has become the pensioners full time occupation and says it is just as thrilling as catching criminals. Mr Jackson admitted that he sometimes spends more time online than he should. He said: 'It's a little bit addictive. I look at a bit of data, then I know I should stop but I think 'just one more'. 'You never know what the next one is going to be' The discovery led researchers to claim moons like the one depicted in the film Avatar may be among the most common places to find alien life. Astronomers came to the conclusion after identifying up to 15 new planets orbiting the life-friendly 'habitable zones' of stars. All are giant gaseous worlds similar in size to Jupiter or Neptune. James Cameron's Avatar was set on a moon filled with lush forests - and researchers say it could be more real than its director thought. While such planets would not themselves be suitable for Earth-like life, they could be circled by moons on which there are forests, oceans and living creatures, researchers now believe. Pandora, the fictional moon in Avatar, is just such a world. So far only one of the 15 newly discovered objects has been confirmed as an exoplanet with 99.9% certainty. The rest still fall into the category of 'candidate' planets while further evidence is collected. The confirmed planet, known as PH2 b, orbits a sun-like star in the constellation Cygnus several hundred light years away. Astronomer Dr Chris Lintott, from Oxford University, a member of the international team behind the discovery, said: 'There's an obsession with finding Earth-like planets but what we are discovering with planets such as PH2 b is far stranger. 'Jupiter has several large water-rich moons. Imaging dragging that system into the comfortably warm region where the Earth is. 'If such a planet had Earth-size moons, we'd see not Europa and Callisto but worlds with rivers, lakes and all sorts of habitats: a surprising scenario that might just be common. An artist's impression of of the view from a moon orbiting the planet PH2b. Scientists says Moons like the one depicted in the film Avatar may be among the most common places to find alien life, . 'It may be that the most common habitable worlds are moons around Jupiter and Neptune-size planets rather than rocky planets as in our own solar system.' Members of the public helped astronomers identify the candidate exoplanets by logging onto the planethunters.org website on their home computers. The Planet Hunters project invites 'citizen scientists' to spot graph patterns signifying the tell-tale dip in brightness as planets pass in front of their parent stars. Follow-up work with the Keck telescope in Hawaii provided the proof that PH2 b is almost certainly a genuine planet. Planet Hunters lead scientist Professor Debra Fisher, from Yale University in the US, said: 'We are seeing the emergence of a new era in the Planet Hunters project where our volunteers seem to be at least as efficient as the computer algorithms at finding planets orbiting at habitable zone distances from the host stars. 'Now, the hunt is not just targeting any old exoplanet; volunteers are homing in on habitable worlds.' Avatar featured a world with an entirely alien ecosystem - and experts now say that moon like Pandora could be the best place to look for alien life . Before the latest finds, 19 other exoplanets had already been located in habitable zones. Also known as the 'Goldilocks zone', this is the orbital path where temperatures are not too hot or cold but ""just right"" to permit liquid surface water. Dr Ji Wang, another Planet Hunters scientist from Yale University, said: 'We can speculate that PH2 b might have a rocky moon that would be suitable for life. 'I can't wait for the day when astronomers report detecting signs of life on other worlds instead of just locating potentially habitable environments. 'That could happen any day now.'","Roy Jackson, 71, was part of an online team analysing data - and helped discover new planet PH2b .

Microsoft's team of researchers is looking to transform your living room into a futuristic Star Trek-style 'Holodeck'. In these images, revealed by a patent . application published last month, Microsoft unveiled its vision for its . future game consoles - but instead of watching the action through a . typical computer monitor or TV, your walls come alive with the action. The technology will use Microsoft's . Kinect sensor - which currently lets you control games by waving your . hands at the television - to map out your . room and your location within it, before a range of video projectors overlay a full and immersive 3D world over your surroundings. So, instead of turning your TV on to play . computer games, your whole living room - plant pots and all - could be . transformed into a full 3D world from which you can hunt aliens on a . distant planet or take part in epic Westerns. The holodeck in your lounge: Using Microsoft's Kinect sensor and projectors, the company could make gaming - and a raft of other tools - very immersive . No more game pads: Your room could be turned into a full virtual environment . Patently Apple, which reports on innovations by Apple and its competitors, spotted the patent application this week. The Kinect will also be able to recognise the furniture in your room, either incorporating chairs and tables directly into the game, or masking them by adapting the video output to render the items invisible. It conjures up an image where a gamer could literally turn around in their living room to see an enemy sneaking up behind them. The Kinect has been one of Microsoft's runaway successes of the last few years, beginning life as an accessory for the company's Xbox games console. Instead of being tied to a controller, players could use their body to control the action in a myriad ways - for instance virtually pulling back a bow and arrow, or dancing as the console rated how good (or bad) you are at copying on-screen celebrities. The technology would use a range of projectors to create an environment around the player, and the Kinect would sense your movements . It works by using infra-red and a depth camera technology to work out where you are standing, and your body position, and translating these to your in-game character. It is unknown how far along this . technology is. The patent was first filed early last year, and was . published by the Patent and Trademark Office in the last month. Writer Jack Purcher on Patently Apple . said: 'I could remember it being so dramatic when gaming shifted from . the CRT to HDTV with 1080p. 'Games came to life like never . before. So the very thought that gaming will one day be able to immerse . us into detailed gaming environments by projecting the imagery of the . game onto the walls of our room is simply wild. 'Just having it projected unto the . wall behind our HDTV's would be a great start - but having it truly . immerse us with the gaming enviroment taking over all four walls around . us could be a real breakthrough in the gaming experience.'","Microsoft's 'Kinect' sensor, coupled with range of projectors, could convert living room into virtual world .

In Danny Boyle: Creating Wonder - in conversation with Amy Raphael, it is revealed that despite running up costs of £27million for the opening ceremony, the Oscar-winning director said one of the main causes for disputes with organisers was over costs. He became riled after organisers tried to sell volunteers their ceremony costumes, rather than allowing them to keep the outfits as souvenirs. He said: 'Of course, Locog decided to ditch the tradition in favour of selling the costumes to the volunteers. I said they must be joking. 'We won in the end, and they took them home without having to pay.' Despite running up a bill of £27million for the opening ceremony, Boyle said the biggest clash with Locog was over costs . Boyle clashed with organisers after they tried to sell volunteers their costumes, rather than letting them keep the outfits as a memento .

Boyle . also admitted his threats of resigning were 'useful' in getting his own . way.

One of his . greatest triumphs of the ceremony was persuading the Queen to take part . in a comical film with James Bond actor Daniel Craig. Boyle . lamented that his original plan to use a Paul Farley poem in the scene . was vetoed because it ends with the line: 'Jesus, I'm the f****** . Queen!' He said: 'For some reason the powers that be weren't keen.' The line: 'Jesus, I'm the f****** Queen!' was omitted from the clip featuring Daniel Craig and the Queen . The threat of resignation was 'useful' to help Boyle get his own way, he said in a new book about his experience of the Games . After ground-to-air missiles were deployed on buildings in east London close to the Olympic stadium the 56-year-old director said he came 'close to walking away'. Similar moral quandries also led artist Damian Hirst and scriptwriter Frank Cottrel-Boyce to threaten resignation from their roles as part of the Games. The two were appalled after details emerged of a £7million sponsorship deal with Dow chemicals, the firm linked to a company involved in the Bhopal gas disaster in India which killed 15,000 people. Hirst pulled out of designing a fabric wrap for the stadium, which was set to transform the venue into a Hanging Garden covered in ivy. But Hirst did subsequently provide other works for the closing ceremony. Danny Boyle nearly quit over the positioning of surface-to-air missiles on the roof of Fred Wigg Tower in Leytonstone .

Police were called in to control the disorder as Ms Bachmann stopped to meet supporters at the Hamburg Inn No.2 in Iowa City, a popular stop for presidential candidates. About two dozen activists with Occupy Iowa City packed the diner before Bachmann arrived yesterday afternoon, then loudly chanted in unison as she tried to mingle with supporters. Out of this world: Roboprof the gay robot attempted to shout down Republican candidate Michelle Bachmann in Iowa City yesterday . Their chant blasted the Minnesota congresswoman's position on gay rights, health care and taxes and ended with: 'You're not wanted here. So go, just go.' Among the hecklers was one man dressed as a robot, calling himself Roboprof, who shouted down Ms Bachmann with a built-in megaphone. 'I am a gay robot. I oppose Bachmann's position on gays, whether they are human or robot,' he was quoted as saying by the Iowa City Patch. The restaurant's manager says the campaign blared Christmas songs over a sound system to drown out the protesters. Activist: Roboprof told the Minnesota congresswoman he opposed her position on gays, 'whether human or robot' Supporters of the candidate, some of whom were later spotted by Iowa City Patch on the Bachmann campaign bus, shouted, 'We love you, Michelle,' and, 'You are our next president.' Roboprof was eventually prevailed upon to leave the diner after a few words from Bachmann supporters. Four police officers arrived as tensions rose, but no one was arrested. Undeterred, Ms Bachmann spent about 20 minutes in the diner shaking hands, signing autographs and posing for pictures.

She has recently been campaigning heavily in Eastern Iowa, but a recent poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers showed she had 7.4 percent of the support, enough for fifth place.

Five-time gold Olympic medallist Sir Steve, 50,  and wife Lady Ann, 53, were walking on Ipanema beach last week when they were confronted by a mugger who demanded their watches and money.

Last night Sir Steve – who is the most successful male rower in Olympic history – confirmed the incident had taken place but declined to comment further. However, the attack is an embarrassing blow for Brazil’s Olympic organisers – who are keen to promote Rio’s improved safety record and dispel fears over crime. Sir Steve and Lady Ann, a fellow rower who represented Britain in the women’s eight at the LA Olympics in 1984, flew to Brazil two weeks ago. He was there to attend the Laureus World Sport Awards – dubbed the Oscars of the sporting world – but also visited Rio’s Lake Lagoa, the rowing venue for the 2016 Olympics. After the visit, Sir Steve spoke of his excitement at the spectacular venue, located in the shadow of Rio’s iconic Corcovado mountain. He said: ‘It’s a marvellous setting,  absolutely stunning.

Rumours abounded that Bo had flown out to Hawaii on Saturday with the First Family then returned to Washington D.C. for the Wednesday photos. First Dog: President Barack Obama shops for Christmas presents with his dog Bo at PetSmart in Alexandria, Virginia, on Wednesday .

Young British soldiers who have had combat experience are more likely to commit violent crimes when they return home from the armed forces. Of around 3,000 military men under the age of 30, more than a fifth had a conviction for violent offences, compared with 6.7 per cent of their peers who are not in the army. There were strong links between combat experience with post-deployment alcohol misuse, traumatic stress and violence. British soldiers who have experienced combat are more likely to commit violent crime and suffer from alcohol misuse and post traumatic stress disorder (file image) Men who had seen combat in Iraq and Afghanistan were 53 per cent more likely to commit a violent offence than comrades given non-combat roles. Those with multiple experiences of combat had a 70 per cent to 80 per cent greater risk of committing acts of violence. In the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken, researchers were given access to police records on almost 14,000 randomly selected men and women who were active or former members of the armed forces, mostly the Army. Participants provided information about their experiences before and after joining the military and underwent psychological tests. A search of the Police National Computer was made for any convictions, cautions or warnings relating to the study population. Overall, 17 per cent of the men had criminal records, and 11 per cent had committed violent offences. Of the 2,728 aged 30 and younger, 20.6 per cent had a criminal record for violence. Professor Sir Simon Wessely said screening within the armed forces to identify at-risk individuals would not work (file image) The findings, released on the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War, are published in a special issue of The Lancet medical journal. Study leader Dr Deirdre MacManus, from King's College London, said: ‘There has been a lot of media coverage and public debate about violence committed by veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. ‘Our study, which used official criminal records, found that violent offending was most common among young men from the lower ranks of the Army and was strongly associated with a history of violent offending before joining the military. ‘Serving in a combat role and traumatic experiences on deployment also increased the risk of violent behaviour.’ Violent offences covered a broad range of acts, from verbal harassment to homicide. They did not include incidents of domestic violence. A strong association was seen between violent offending and high levels of self-reported aggression. Professor Sir Simon Wessely, co-director of the Centre for Military Health Research at King's College London, who co-authored the study, admitted that an aggressive streak can be useful in a soldier. ‘Some people with aggressive dispositions make very good soldiers, that's the nature of the game,’ he told a press conference in London. He added: ‘My own view, and the view of many people in this area, is that you meet a lot of people in the armed forces who you're glad are in the armed forces, and it's doing them a lot of good.’ But he stressed that the vast majority of soldiers returning from tours of duty in combat zones never got into trouble. ‘Not every single person who joins the armed forces is Sir Lancelot or Sir Galahad,’ said the professor. ‘We are suggesting there is a problem that needs to be looked at, but just as with post traumatic stress disorder this is not a common outcome in military populations. Overall you must remember that of those who serve in combat, 94 per cent of who come back will not offend.’ Screening within the armed forces to identify at-risk individuals would not work, he argued. For every correct prediction there were likely to be five that were wrong. However he said his group had started conducting random mental health checks on several thousand members of the armed forces returning from active duty. In the US, this is a routine procedure. Commenting on the report, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘We are committed to supporting members of our Armed Forces and their families as they return to civilian life post deployment. ‘That is why we funded this research and have comprehensive mental health support available before, during and after operations. We also ensure that all personnel go through a thorough period of decompression to help make this adjustment. ‘This report recognises that the vast majority of service personnel make this adjustment successfully and are not more likely to commit a violent offence post deployment - there is only an increased risk of 2 per cent when compared to the general population. ‘However, any violent offence is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by our Armed Forces. If a member of our Armed Forces or their family experiences violence there is a wide range of support and help available to them.’ Aaron Wilkinson, 24, shot his landlady Judith Garnett with a shotgun at point-blank range when he returned from Afghanistan. But he was convicted with manslaughter rather than murder because he was suffering with post traumatic stress disorder at the time of the killing. The court was told Wilkinson had been badly affected by seeing three Afghan soldiers blown up by a Taliban bomb. Aaron Wilkinson was convicted of manslaughter after shooting his landlady while suffering from PTSD . On his return from Afghanistan Wilkinson worked on a game . farm run by mother-of-two Mrs Garnett. Judith Garnett had taken in Aaron Wilkinson and treated him like a member of her own family . Wilkinson worked for her and lived at her home in Woodlesford, . near Leeds. She had taken him in a decade earlier when he was homeless . after being thrown out by his mother, and treated him like a member of . the family. After his tour in 2010 Wilkinson talked constantly about his time . in Afghanistan with the Welsh Regiment, wore combat clothing and held . a shotgun as if he was carrying an Army rifle. He even carried a piece of shrapnel in a jar that had been pulled out of his thigh after a mortar attack. When Mrs Garnett ordered him to leave in January 2011, he snapped and killed her with three blasts from a shotgun. He then dialled 999 and told the operator: ‘I have done something absolutely terrible...  I just had a moment of madness.’ The court heard the combination of Asperger’s and PTSD left him unlikely to be able to exercise self-control. Colleague Mark McCabe said during his service Wilkinson . often built a campfire on his own away from other troops. On one . occasion he heard Wilkinson laughing and discovered he had skewered a . cat with a red-hot poker. He was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to his PTSD and Asperger's syndrome.","Combat soldiers 53 per cent more prone to violent crimes than colleagues .

Hoddesdon in March last year but between June and October they were . subjected to racially-aggravated harassment, common assault, criminal . damage and threatening behaviour.

Magistrates heard how Cross harassed the couple by throwing objects at their house over the course of five months. David Cross, 66, was handed a was handed a six-month suspended jail sentence and a restraining order at Stevenage Magistrates' Court . Charlotte Roos, prosecuting, described a common assault which took place in October last year. She said: ‘Elinda saw an arm reaching out of the window of the house belonging to the Crosses and a pint glass was being held. ‘This was launched at her and landed on the floor. She screamed and jumped back into the house.’ After the sentencing at Stevenage Magistrates’ Court on Monday, Mr Keenan, 34, said he felt ‘let down by the justice system’. He said: ‘You don’t think you will go through all that and all he will get is basically a slap on the wrist. ‘I could not have been nicer to him, . but he just started becoming hostile towards us. How are we supposed to . live with this restraining order when we live so close to each other?’ Mr Keenan said he and his wife were now desperate to move away from Cross as soon as possible. He added: ‘It has reached the stage . where we can’t invite people down to see us. We need to move somewhere . else.

Hertford Magistrates’ Court on February 5. At sentencing, he was handed a . restraining order and told to make no direct or indirect contact with Mr . and Mrs Keenan until further notice. He was also ordered to pay costs of £350, a victim surcharge of £80 and compensation of £100 each to Mr and Mrs Keenan. Samantha Jones, mitigating, said: ‘Mr Cross works in the building industry as a digger driver. ‘He has previous convictions, but . many years have passed by before the next one. There have been large . periods in which he has not been offending against anyone. ‘When he finds stable work it keeps him occupied, but when he loses his job things start to go wrong. ‘To his credit he is known in the area for what he does and is recognised by many people as being a hard worker.’","David Cross, 66, racially abused James and Elinda Keenan for five months .

They face death threats for breaking tradition, but two dozen women have been recruited as special forces commandos in the Afghan Army. Colonel Jalauddin Yaftaly, head of elite units in the Afghan forces, sought to hire women in 2011 because they were needed to help conduct night raids. Night missions are considered the most dangerous operations because they involve raiding the homes of suspected Taliban insurgents under the cover of darkness and searching the inhabitants. Two dozen women were hired to play an important role in night raids carried out by the Afghan special forces . Before women joined the special forces the raids were seen as controversial because it is considered offensive for male troops to search female Afghans in their homes. Now, with new female recruits on board, where possible women search women. But despite the role the female recruits play to allow more dignity for the women they search, their work has made them targets in Afghanistan - where women face a culture of discrimination. Female recruits cover their faces with scarves to protect their identities because they face death threats .

She said: 'We do face death threats because our work is outside of our culture but this is an important job. Brigadier General Mohammadzai Khatool is the only woman general in the Afghan Army . 'My family supports me, they never told me not to do it. They know it is important for Afghanistan,' she told NBC.

I wish I could be alive and be around to see them become . generals in this country.' There are more than 1,000 women in the Afghan Army and Brigadier General Mohammadzai Khatool is the only female general. She had been forced to leave the military when the Taliban took over Afghanistan, but when the Taliban fell in 2002 she returned and was promoted to general.

A grandmother gave five schoolchildren drugs from her own stash to make cannabis cakes, a court heard. The teenagers, one aged 13, two 14-year-olds and two 15-year-olds, were allowed to bake chocolate brownies laced with the Class B drug. Iris Thornton, 55, also allowed them to smoke the drug, which she used for pain relief from backache, Falkirk Sheriff Court heard . Iris Thornton, 55, allowed five teenagers to bake brownies laced with the Class B drug (file picture) The offence was only discovered when police investigated a pupil at a Stirlingshire high school possessing cannabis. For legal reasons, neither the children not the school can be identified. Alison Montgomery, prosecuting, said the youngsters were given a polythene wrap of herbal cannabis by Thornton to bake drug-laced cakes at her home  in Dennyoanhead, Stirlingshire. The depute fiscal said the schoolchildren were at Thornton's house on October 21 last year. She . said: 'The accused asked them if they wanted to bake brownies and gave . them money to buy the cake mix. When they returned from the shop she . gave them a wrap of herbal cannabis to mix in.' Once baked, the chocolate brownies were dished out to the youngsters and Thornton, she added. Defence solicitor Neil Hay said: 'The . children were not coerced but as a responsible adult she knows that she . shouldn't have allowed this while they were in her care.' Thornton, . of Loanhead Avenue, Dennyloanhead, also known as Iris Martin, admitted . possessing and being concerned in the supply of the controlled drug. Iris Thornton was handed a community order at Falkirk Sheriff Court of 250 hours unpaid work . Thornton was told her actions were 'deplorable' by Sheriff William Gallacher, who said he had come close to sending her to jail. However when Thornton appeared for sentencing she walked free from court with a community order requiring her to complete 250 hours of unpaid work . Sheriff Gallacher told her she had risked the health of the five young people involved when they were in her home.

When six-year-old Oliver Hudd set out for the first time to find some treasure with his new metal detector he could never have imagined what he was about to discover. After just a few sweeps of the ground, the youngster unearthed an 8lb First World War bomb - resulting in the bomb squad evacuating the area. Oliver had been looking for Roman coins in his grandad's back garden in Dartford, Kent, with his dad Jason when the drama began. Buried treasure: Oliver was on the hunt for Roman coins when he found the First World War bomb . The family had been enjoying Mother's Day when Oliver and his dad rushed back into the house and dialled 999. Kent Police arrived at the house at 5pm on Sunday and cordoned off the road while the bomb disposal squad checked the device. The bomb shell was found not to contain any explosives but the family say they have been told not to dig in the garden anymore incase they find a live one. Mother-of-two Jenny Smith, 36, said: 'We couldn't believe it. The first time he goes out with his metal detector and finds that. Discovery: Oliver Hudd at the spot where he discovered the bomb which led to a police operation . Operation: Police were called to Oliver's grandad's house where the bomb was found in the garden .

'Jason was using it for a bit without any luck, but as soon as Oliver touched it, it started beeping. 'He dug down and felt the spade hit metal. He kept digging and hit it a good few times with the spade before seeing the pointed end and realising it looked like a bomb.' At first the family thought it was an old baked bean tin but they phoned the police to check. 'Oliver was so excited, running around the house shouting ""we found a bomb""', said Ms Smith. 'But my three-year-old daughter Josie was scared and clinging to me. Evacuate: Oliver had no idea he would discover a First World War bomb with his new metal detector . 'I think Oliver reckons he's always going to be finding exciting things now - a bomb in every field.' Jenny and engineer Jason, from South Darenth, Kent, asked if Oliver could keep the shell as a souvenir but bomb disposal experts said he was not allowed to. Oliver has been showing off pictures of his amazing discovery to his friends at school during show and tell. His mother added: 'The bomb disposal experts confirmed that it was a First World War bomb. 'The bomb disposal units weren't sure why it was there - if it was a dud-bomb or a training tool - but they've told us not to dig up the area anymore in case there are more bombs, and with explosives in this time.'

Convicted: Aadil Asghar, 25, was found guilty after killing 12-year-old schoolboy Harsh Dharmendra . A boy racer in a sports car killed a schoolboy after weaving in and out of heavy traffic and hurtling down a bus lane. Aadil Asghar was told he faces a jail sentence after hitting and killing 12-year-old Harsh Dharmendra who was crossing the road on his way home from school. The boy was thrown 10ft into the air by the force of the impact and landed in the back of a car just yards away from his home. Tragically the pedestrian crossing where he had attempted to cross was not working at the time he was hit. He died in hospital the next day. The jury was told the 25-year-old driver had been cutting across lanes in a bid to get ahead of traffic and was in the designated bus lane when he struck the schoolboy. He was also estimated to be travelling over 40mph in his white Audi A1, emblazoned with grey racing stripes, on the road which is a designated 30mph zone. The jury heard one driver warned 'he's going to kill someone' as Asghar cut up cars just moments before the fatal crash. Alan Blake, prosecuting, said: 'The collision was the culmination of aggressive and impatient driving as the defendant drove his vehicle in heavy traffic proceeding out of Reading.' 'When Harsh stepped out in to the bus lane there was no prospect of the defendant being able to bring his vehicle to a stop,' he added. In court: A jury at Reading Crown Court convicted Aadil Asghar of causing death by dangerous driving . Witness Katie Herd was driving home from work in her Audi A3 on the day of the boy's tragic collision and said she saw Asghar's Audi 'weaving in and out of the traffic.' Asghar admitted causing death by careless driving but contested a more serious charge of death by dangerous driving. However, a jury at Reading Crown Court convicted him of causing death by dangerous driving on February 21 last year in King's Road, Reading, Berks. He was released on conditional bail and will be sentenced on April 11 by Judge Stephen John.","Aadil Asghar was told he faces a jail sentence after mowing down 12-year-old Harsh Dharmendra .

Travel firm Thomas Cook has offered a British couple compensation after they drank water from a tank which was contaminated by a dead body. Horrified Michael and Sabina Baugh, both 27, were holidaying at the Cecil Hotel in Los Angeles when the body of a missing Canadian woman was found in a water tank on the hotel roof. The pair had been drinking and showering in the contaminated water for the first week of their stay last month. 'Sick to the stomach': Michael and Sabina Baugh said the water at the hotel 'tasted funny' Now, Thomas Cook has offered the couple, from Plymouth, Devon, £2,000 to make up for their ruined package holiday - which cost them more than £1,500. Mrs Baugh said: 'We said we need to think about it. We are not sure. 'We wanted our money back with compensation on top. But we are not sure that £500 is enough. 'We haven’t accepted the money so it’s not over yet.' The area has one of the highest crime rates in the city, so rather than go in search of bottled water at night, they drank from the tap. But the body of Elisa Lam, a student at the University of British Columbia in Canada, was found in one of the four large water tanks after a maintenance worker went up to investigate reports of low water pressure. The student had been travelling to Santa Cruz in northern California when she disappeared. Mystery: Los Angeles fire fighters peer down at the water tanks on the roof of the Hotel Cecil as they try to figure out how to remove the body of a young woman found inside . Michael Baugh said they felt unwell 'mentally' after they heard the body of Elisa Lam was in the water tank . 'Since we came back we have been working so we have not had time to make an appointment to go and see the doctor. 'We are feeling fine, it’s just quite a traumatic experience. I couldn’t sleep for a few nights,' said Mrs Baugh. Luckily the water they were drinking was later found to contain no harmful bacteria. Found: Lam was found wedged in the water tank above the Cecil Hotel by a maintenance worker after guests complained of low water pressure . Mr Baugh added: 'We really don’t know what to do, we will probably think about it for a few days and decided what to do from there. 'We aren’t really sure whether to accept it, but at the same time we don’t want to be unreasonable and greedy.' A spokeswoman for Thomas Cook said: 'We know how important holidays are to our customers and we take any issues affecting our guests very seriously. 'We can only imagine how upsetting and stressful the events in Los Angeles must have been for Mr and Mrs Baugh, and whilst they can’t be predicted, we’re discussing how we can make amends for what happened on their holiday.'

Crushed to death: Shocked workers found Adrian Roberts trapped inside the machinery he had been cleaning . A labourer who worked in a slaughterhouse was crushed to death inside an industrial meat process machine he was cleaning, an inquest has heard. Adrian Roberts was killed instantly after a heavy hydraulic arm came down on top of him. A coroner heard the 49-year-old may have broken Health and Safety rules by turning on the rotating machine, which separates the hind legs from cattle carcasses, to make it easier to wash. Shocked co-workers found Mr Roberts trapped inside the machinery. He was discovered standing on a raised platform, with his torso bent inside the heavy-duty equipment. The hydraulic arm of the machine had come down on top of him after he had leaned inside to scrub it down. The labourer had worked at F Drury and Sons’ abattoir near Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, for one year before his death on August 18 2011. His colleagues told an inquest in Salisbury that the machinery should have been turned off prior to cleaning and all electrical power cut to the machinery by two separate isolation switches at the slaughterhouse. But Martin Ball, the firm's loading bay supervisor, told the inquest: 'He was slumped over the cage of the rise and fall platform. 'I shouted ""what’s up Ades?"" I got no reply and that’s when I went up to see what his problem was.' His voice cracking with emotion, Mr Ball continued: 'I saw Ady trapped between the puller and the rise and fall platform. 'His hands were blue. I knew he was dead. 'I ran to the manager’s office to alert them and get them to call an ambulance.' Mr Ball told the inquest it was common for the power supply to be turned back on to wash down machinery after a day’s slaughter - which is against safety guidelines. 'I know it goes on,' he said. 'It gets switched on, on the cleaning side of it afterwards on most days. 'It’s known by me, I don’t know if it’s known by other employees.' Killed instantly: The labourer had worked at F Drury and Sons' abattoir near Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire . Mr Ball claimed he didn’t know the machinery was supposed to be turned off while it was being cleaned. 'I didn’t know not to. It’s not my area of cleaning so I didn’t know what procedure they go through.' Mr Ball also revealed Mr Roberts had reacted angrily when he was being teased by colleagues earlier on the day of his death. 'He had been taking a lot of banter during the day,' he said. 'Some of the blokes don’t know when to stop. 'There was a ping behind me. It was a knife hitting a metal post. 'Ady had thrown it down in a temper or something. He just left the building.' Labourer Scott Sturgess, who trained Mr Roberts to clean the machinery, said it was policy to turn all the machines off while cleaning down the abattoir. 'I specifically did say no machines should be turned on, there should be no reason to power on any of the machines and he never questioned me about it,' said Mr Sturgess as he gave evidence to the inquest jury. However, the coroner heard how some cleaners did routinely power up the equipment to wash it as it was turning because it was easier and quicker. Polish worker Adam Bielenuki said he received training on the job from 'a friend' to turn the machines back on for cleaning. 'When I switched it on, I could wash the machinery a lot better,' he explained. 'You don’t need to switch it on but I switched it on because it was more comfortable for me and that was how my friend showed me to do it.' The inquest heard that managers at the abattoir had changed safety procedures after the death, including locking access to the isolation switches which cut power to the heavy machinery. A pathologist concluded that Mr Roberts, from Toothill, Swindon, died from asphyxiation due to chest compression. The inquest continues.","Adrian Roberts was killed instantly at the abattoir in Wiltshire .

The 18-wheel juggernaut gives him the perfect vantage point from which to peer into other cars and spot any un-driver-like behaviour.

He is one of 97 officers in the state who carry a heavy goods licence so they too can trundle the roads peering into passing cars. It is the brainchild of Lt.

Hundreds of miners at Britain's deepest coal mine which was devastated by an underground fire were given the sack by text, it emerged today. The 650 miners at Daw Mill Colliery near Fillongley, Warwickshire, were given their marching orders after their shifts finished on Wednesday night. Heartless UK Coal bosses which runs the colliery told staff the pit was closing by text. It read: 'Colleagues, I apologise for the late note. It is important to me that you hear from me personally that the company will formally announce the closure of Daw Mill without chance of reprieve tomorrow [Thursday] morning. Marching orders: The 650 miners at Daw Mill Colliery near Fillongley, Warwickshire, were given their marching orders after their shifts finished on Wednesday night . 'A detailed update will follow. Best regards, M. Haworth.' The announcement came just three weeks after a fierce blaze destroyed equipment and left it with no more workable coal. Yesterday workers expressed outrage at the way staff were told the devastating news. Father-of-one Dave Meuse, 55, from nearby Nuneaton, who has worked at the mine since leaving school 38 years ago, said: 'It's heart breaking. There have been grown men openly crying. 'Heartbreaking': The announcement came just three weeks after a fierce blaze destroyed equipment and left it with no more workable coal . Foreboding: Miners said the fire meant all the coal-face equipment had been taken away and the shafts had been flooded, so it was 'fairly obvious' that the pit would not re-open . 'I've seen blokes who have been here . as long as me walking out with just a small bag in their hands, carrying . tools they are never likely to use again. 'We did fear the worst because of the serious extent of the fire, which is still burning. 'All . the coal-face equipment has gone and the shafts have been flooded, so . it was fairly obvious that the pit would not re-open. 'Even so, the sudden closure has come as a devastating shock. 'We were given the news on Wednesday night by text message, which could, perhaps, have been done better. 'But the management explained that they wanted everyone to know before the statement was released to the media.' Historic: Daw Mill is the last remaining mine in the Warwickshire coalfields and will shut after 47 years of production . As . branch secretary of the Union of Democratic Mine workers, Mr Meuse is . now helping to negotiate redundancy terms for his 400 members. He said: 'Things are a little uncertain at the moment. 'The . company is looking for financial support from the government to be able . to make enhanced payments, which is what we are hoping for. 'Some . men are being retained temporarily for the close-down operation and . around 70 have been offered jobs at Thoresby Colliery in . Nottinghamshire. 'But otherwise, that's it for the rest of us; the end of the line. 'Coal mining is in my blood and it is so sad to see the way the industry has declined.' A spokesman for UK coal said the texts had been sent as a last resort because they had not wanted employees to learn about the closure on the news. He said: 'We were determined that our employees should hear about the closure from the company rather than hear it on the news the next day. 'I'm bitterly disappointed that some have complained at being given advance warning that the mine was to close. 'At briefing sessions immediately after the fire, we asked all employees to ensure we had their contact details so that we could update them on developments. 'Most provided email addresses and received a more detailed and compassionate message. 'Unfortunately,  some didn't have email addresses and others chose not to provide one. 'As such, they were contacted via their mobile phone - the route they had chosen to be contacted by. 'I appreciate that this is a difficult time but we have worked extremely hard to keep our employees informed using the routes they chose. As such, this criticism is totally unjustified and very disappointing.' Gary Butler, 47, from Polesworth, Warks., has worked at the mine for 25 years. He said: 'It's the only job I've ever done and I really don't know what the future will bring, although I am trying to remain positive.' Mr Butler, 47, was one of the 106 miners evacuated when the fire broke out 740 metres below the surface, on February 22. He added: 'The emergency procedure kicked in and everyone got out okay.

Police stormed into a motel room in this seaside town Tuesday evening and captured a Washington state man suspected of killing his grandparents, ending a multi-state search and a tense daylong standoff at the motel. 'Everyone's safe. No one's hurt,' said Lincoln City Police Chief Keith Kilian. Police had spent much of the day trying to persuade Michael Boysen to surrender. After breaching the motel room door, they stormed in and captured him. Kilian said no shots were fired and Boysen offered no resistance. Scroll down for video . Authorities have apprehended Boysen after he allegedly killed his 82-year-old grandfather and 80-year-old grandmother in their Renton, Washington home last week . Limited damage: Boysen allegedly cut himself during the ordeal and he had to be taken to a hospital . Kilian said Boysen had suffered from a self-inflicted wound, apparently a cut. He was taken away in an ambulance. The bodies of Boysen's grandparents . were found Saturday in their suburban Seattle home, a day after Boysen . was released from prison and was greeted with a welcome home party. During the siege in this tourist . town, police pointed rifles at the motel, fired blasts from a water . cannon and used a bullhorn to try to persuade Boysen to give up. Boysen checked into the motel Monday . night under his own name, but the name wasn't recognized until Tuesday . morning when a desk clerk saw a television story about the case and . called the Lincoln City police, Kilian said. Boysen, 26, made threats against . members of his family and law enforcement while behind bars, Corrections . Department spokesman Chad Lewis said Tuesday. On guard: Police vehicles are seen outside of the Oceanfront Motel in Oregon on Tuesday as they tried for hours to coax Boysen out of his barricaded room . Prepping: Flash bangs and loud speakers were being used by police while they tried to get Boysen out of the motel room, which happened successfully Tuesday night . But authorities didn't learn of the . threats until after the bodies of the grandparents were found and . authorities had started looking for Boysen. 'Sources went to our staff at the Monroe Correctional Center and told us he had been threatening to do all this,' Lewis said. The information was passed on to King . County deputies, and that's why King County Sheriff John Urquhart . called Boysen extremely dangerous at a Monday news conference. Three loud bangs were heard at the Westshore OceanFront Suites in this tourist town early in the afternoon. Lincoln City's police chief says officers caused them, although he wouldn't elaborate on how exactly the noise was made. Have you seen this car? Police are also searching for the victims' missing red, 2001 Chrysler 300, a photo of which they released today in a bid to track it . Before and after the bangs, police . used a loudspeaker to try to persuade the person inside a room at the . motel to disarm and surrender. The voice on the loudspeaker said, . 'There's a lot of people who want to see you come out OK.' History: Michael 'Chad' Boysen was released from prison after serving nine months for a burglary charge . Police had sent a small robot up some stairs and onto a balcony of the motel before the blasts. Boysen just finished serving nine . months in prison on a burglary conviction, Lewis said. He had no violent . infractions in prison - 'nothing extraordinary,' Lewis said. He served a previous sentence between 2006 and February 2011 for four robbery convictions. Those convictions were related to an addiction to narcotic painkillers, Lewis said. Boysen's grandparents picked him up . from prison in Monroe on Friday, drove him to meet his probation officer . and to get an identification card from the Department of Licensing. They held a welcome home party for him Friday night. The bodies were discovered by Boysen's . mother Saturday evening. She had been called by a family member who . became concerned that the couple hadn't answered their door. Authorities haven't said how they died. Investigators determined that Boysen had been searching the Internet for gun shows. The motive for the killings remains unknown, King County sheriff's Sergeant Cindi West said.

The ability to shimmy up a ladder at a moment's notice to scrub glass until it gleams is surely the most important skill to window cleaning. And without it, work can be a real pane. Not so for Gerald Ash, 46, who, at 35 stone, is not only too fat to use a ladder but he is so afraid of heights that  he gets scared after reaching the second rung. Nonetheless, cuddly Gerald powers on from the safety of the pavement washing windows with a squeegee firmly stuck on the end of a pole. He launched the business in Gloucester in January after struggling to find work because of his huge size. Big business: Gerald Ash, 46, hit on his bright idea after struggling to find work because of his huge size . He spent three months 'training' and . almost all his benefits on window cleaning equipment - but can only wash . windows from the ground using a squeegee on the end of a pole. Pasty-loving Gerald used to tip the scales at a massive 50st, but slimmed down in recent years in a bid to control his diabetes. His business is just getting off the ground and he has found himself four customers on his round in Gloucester. He said: 'I'm a big lad - 46, . diabetic, and in excess of 20 stone overweight and nobody is going to . give me a job. I wouldn't give myself a job. 'So that's why I'm getting out there and doing what I can to make a difference to my own life. 'I . was sat at home one day, wondering what I could do to get my out there. And then I came up with an idea that stunned me - I could clean windows . for a living. 'However, I can't use a ladder. They're only recommended for loads up to 150kg, and I weigh more than 250kg. Step by step: Ladders buckle under 72-inch waisted Gerald's bulk - and he gets scared after reaching the second rung . Fear of heights: He spent three months 'training' - but can only clean windows from the ground using a squeegee on the end of a pole . 'I'd be too worried it was going to snap with me on top. Also, once I get past the second rung I start crying and screaming for my mummy. 'I'm not good with heights at all - it's hardly the best thing for a would-be window cleaner.' Single Gerald, a former bus driver, added: 'I do my landlord's windows and my ex-wife's windows - but they don't pay me. Ambitions: Gerald hopes that once his window-cleaning business is up and running he can expand to cleaning bins and patios . 'I've spent three months and all my money learning how to clean windows, and I want to do it right. 'I've got it off to a tee now - I'm certainly never going to be the fastest cleaner in the world, but I want to deliver the best quality.' Beefy Gerald, who is 6ft 3in tall, hopes his new career will help him lose more weight. He said: 'At the end of the day, I'm fat, and that makes me an expert in weight-loss. 'Diets are a waste of time - it's all about how active you are and how busy you keep yourself. I'm hoping this is going to keep me busy.' He hopes that once his window-cleaning business is up and running he can expand to cleaning bins and patios. Gerald set himself up as a window cleaner by spending almost all his employment support allowance on equipment. He splashed out £136 of his £142 fortnightly benefit on squeegees, a bucket, sponges, rags and cleaning liquids. He also forked-out on a four-metre long system of telescopic poles so he can reach first floor windows as well as those on the ground level. His 'training' before he started involved scouring YouTube for videos of people window cleaning so he could pick up some tips. Gerald said: 'Window-cleaning courses cost hundreds of pounds and I really couldn't afford that. 'I watched all the videos I could find on Youtube and practised, practised and practised. 'Window cleaning isn't rocket science, but it is a skill, and like all skills, practice makes perfect.'","Gerald Ash, 46, got the idea after struggling to find work due of his size .

But a hungry crocodile has been captured on camera chomping on one of its less fortunate cousins in a rare documented case of cannibalism. The two-metre long reptile, nicknamed Eric, was hunting for prawns and small fish when he came across the other crocodile. But instead of ignoring the younger croc, he attacked the metre long rival, killed and ate it himself head first in a grim, cannibalistic spectacle. Scroll down for video .

Under the terms of their licence to . dig up the remains, the university's scientists have decided Richard III . - killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 - should be re-interred at . Leicester Cathedral. But other experts argue that the king . himself would have wanted to be put to rest at York Minster and that the . remains should be moved to the city.

Calls: Labour MP Hugh Bayley said while the debate appeared good natured at first, it has now taken a more sinister turn . He has now called on the government to set up an independent panel of experts to make a decision once and for all. Speaking during a debate in Westminster Hall, he said: 'I received many letters and emails from members of the public about this, supporting burial in York. 'Most are thoughtful and well argued and based on scientific facts but some are frankly inflammatory and talking yesterday to the Dean of York, some that she has received at the minster are so extreme that she has referred the correspondence to the police. 'I would say to everybody: calm down. Let's all respect the memory of a former king of our country. Let's discuss where his remains should be put to rest in a dignified and sober way. We don't want to reignite the Wars of the Roses.' Nine of the monarch's descendants have called on the Government to return the remains of the king to York for a 'formal and ceremonial' burial, while a petition calling for his remains to be transferred to the northern city has been signed by more than 23,000 people. Mr Bayley said: 'The decision should be taken on independent national advice and not delegated to archaeologists from Leicester who clearly support the Leicester cause. 'They would find it outrageous if the decision was delegated to people from York. We need the decision to be taken nationally, in the national interest by people who are independent of the vested interests of either York or Leicester.' But Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said York Minster itself supported the re-interment of the remains at Leicester Cathedral. He said the decision was up to the University of Leicester, under the terms of its licence.

Under the terms of their licence to dig up the remains, the university's scientists have decided Richard III should be re-interred at Leicester Cathedral, left, but other experts argue that the king himself would have wanted to be put to rest at York Minster, right . He told MPs that, before the archaeologists started digging, they thought it was 'unlikely' they would find the remains of the king. Mr Wright said: 'Now that the exhumation has been completed, it is the University of Leicester's responsibility as holder of the licence to decide where King Richard III remains are finally laid to rest. That is the law. 'Much has been made, not least today, of the fact that the people of York want the remains to be buried in York and I do understand the strength of feeling in York and Yorkshire more widely. 'However, I should make it clear that York Minster has openly supported the re-interment of Richard III's remains in Leicester Cathedral. 'It is also right I think to point out that the default position of the Church of England... is that the remains should be interred at the nearest Christian church and that of course is in this case indeed Leicester Cathedral.'

The discovery of Richard III's skeleton in a Leicester car park was formally announced early in February this year to much fanfare and cheers. It was, scientists said, a historic moment, finally ending the centuries-old . mystery of what happened to the body of the last Plantagenet king.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai hijacked US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel's debut visit to the region yesterday by accusing America of conspiring with the Taliban. A day after two Taliban bombings killed 17 people, Karzai accused the United States and the Taliban of colluding to convince Afghans that foreign forces were needed beyond 2014, when NATO is set to wrap up its combat mission and most troops withdraw. 'Those bombs that went off in Kabul and Khost were not a show of force to America. They were in service of America. It was in the service of the 2014 slogan to warn us if they (Americans) are not here then Taliban will come,' Karzai said in a speech. Scroll down for video . Fighting talk: Karzai said the so-called collusion was a bid to convince Afghans that foreign forces were needed beyond 2014. It . was one of several inflammatory comments by Karzai and his government . on Sunday . Appearances: Hagel's visit coincided with the passing of a deadline imposed by Karzai for U.S. special forces to leave Wardak province accusing them of overseeing torture and killings . 'In fact those bombs, set off . yesterday in the name of the Taliban, were in the service of Americans . to keep foreigners longer in Afghanistan.' It . was one of several inflammatory comments by Karzai and his government . on Sunday and follow weeks of efforts by the Afghan leader to curtail . U.S. military activity in Afghanistan, including a call to kick American . special forces out of an important province. U.S. commanders see . special operations forces as key to the end-phase of the conflict. Response: Hagel appeared at pains to be respectful of Karzai and avoid sharp criticism, but he told reporters that any collusion between the U.S. and the Taliban 'wouldn't make a lot of sense' Hours after Karzai's speech, Hagel said he spoke 'clearly and directly' about the comments during his first meeting with the Afghan leader since becoming U.S. defence secretary on February 27. Hagel appeared at pains to be respectful of Karzai and avoid sharp criticism, but he told reporters that any collusion between the U.S. and the Taliban 'wouldn't make a lot of sense.' The U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, General Joseph Dunford, was more categorical. 'We have fought too hard over the past 12 years, we have shed too much blood over the past 12 years, we have done too much to help the Afghan security forces grow over the last 12 years to ever think that violence or instability would be to our advantage,' Dunford told reporters travelling with Hagel. Of Karzai's remarks, he added: 'I'll let others judge whether that's particularly helpful or not at the political level. Still, politics will be key over the next several months, as the United States and NATO allies work to carry out their strategy of pulling out their troops and decide how large a residual force to leave behind after 2014. NATO defence chiefs meeting in Brussels last month discussed keeping a combined U.S. and allied force of 8,000-12,000 in Afghanistan, focusing on training Afghan troops and countering the remnants of al Qaeda, the Pentagon has said. Any deal for a follow-on force, which Washington says must include immunity for U.S. troops, would need Karzai's blessing. Karzai has a history of making incendiary statements that exasperate Washington but the nature and awkward timing of his latest remarks about the United States were exceptional. He also alleged on Sunday that the Taliban and the United States had been holding talks in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar on a 'daily basis,' further fuelling his suggestion that Washington and the militants were working at common purposes. Goodwill mission: Hagel is in Afghanistan on his first trip as the 24th Secretary of Defense to visit US Troops, NATO leaders, and Afghan counterparts. But Karzai's government has also alleged that US-led forces and Afghans working with them were abusing and arresting university students . 'I told the president that it was not true,' Hagel said. 'The fact is any prospect for peace or political settlements - that has to be led by the Afghans.' The Taliban spokesman in Afghanistan, Zabihullah Mujahid, denied that negotiations with the United States had resumed . Karzai's government also alleged that U.S.-led forces and Afghans working with them were abusing and arresting university students. Karzai issued an executive order banning foreign troops from entering all education institutions. Hagel and Karzai were meant to have appeared together at a joint news conference on Sunday evening. But, in a reminder of the threats posed by the resilient insurgency, U.S. officials said it was cancelled because of security concerns. Afghan security officials inspect the scene of a suicide bomb attack outside the Afghan Defense Ministry in Kabul . A wounded man is carried to a nearby hospital following a bomb blast . Hagel was about a kilometre away and within earshot of a Saturday morning suicide attack outside the defence ministry that killed nine people. He was meant to have met his Afghan counterpart there this weekend but the venue was later changed. Hagel's visit coincided with the passing of a deadline imposed by Karzai for U.S. special forces to leave Wardak province accusing them of overseeing torture and killings. U.S. forces have denied involvement in any abuses. Hagel has sounded hopeful that a deal could be reached on their continued deployment but acknowledged no breakthroughs were made in his talks with Karzai. It was unclear how Hagel's trip would be viewed by U.S. Republicans who bitterly fought his nomination to become defence chief, portraying him as soft on Iran and questioning his judgement. Hagel at times appeared sympathetic to the stresses of political life that Karzai must endure. 'I know these are difficult issues for President Karzai and the Afghan people. And I was once a politician,' Hagel said. 'So I can understand the kind of pressures - especially leaders of countries - are always under.'","Karzai implies US bid to convince Afghans that US forces needed after 2014 .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 02:06 EST, 9 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:06 EST, 9 March 2013 . A proposal in the Utah Legislature that would tax electronic cigarettes at the same rate as regular cigarettes has put the state at the forefront of a national movement to regulate the increasingly popular devices. More than 35 proposals calling for some type of regulation of electronic cigarettes have been introduced this year in legislatures across the country, but Utah seems to be the only state currently proposing that they be taxed like regular tobacco, said Karmen Hanson, a tobacco policy analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures. Hanson is unaware of any state with a law like this on the books. Popular: Jason Cropper, Managing Director of The Electronic Cigarette Company, smokes an electronic cigarette as he shows off his product . Often called 'e-cigarettes,' the battery-powered devices heat a liquid nicotine solution and create vapor that users inhale. Their popularity has spiked in recent years. First marketed overseas in 2002, e-cigarettes first became widely available in U.S. in 2006. There are several million users worldwide today, up from a few thousand in 2006. Analysts estimate sales could double to $1 billion in 2013. Some companies have even started running TV commercials, including an ad during this year's Super Bowl that showed a man using an electronic cigarette made by an Arizona-based company. Many states have been waiting for the Food and Drug Administration to come out with regulation before passing their own laws, but states seem to be growing impatient, Hanson said. 'The more popular they become, a more prominent public policy issue they become,' Hanson said. 'Without federal regulation, it's left up to the states.' The Food and Drug Administration's current stance is that health impact of electronic cigarettes is unknown because it has not been properly studied. There is speculation that the agency will take over regulatory authority of the devices this year, dealing with them in a similar way as they do with regular cigarettes and other tobacco products. The Utah measure's sponsor, Republican Rep. Paul Ray, says e-cigarettes should not be considered healthy. 'They're trying to sell them as nicotine replacement therapy. It is not,' Ray said this week. 'It is not an FDA-approved nicotine replacement therapy. There's medications, there's patches, there's things for that. This is not one of them.' Taxed: On cigarettes, the Utah state tax is generally a flat $1.70 for a pack of 20 . Ray considers electronic cigarettes similar to other tobacco products and says they should be taxed as such. His measure extends to dissolvable tobacco, which is pressed into shapes like tablets that slowly melt in a user's mouth. 'This is terrible stuff. They're . peddling stuff that they know absolutely will kill people,' Ray said. 'This is an industry who kills their clientele.' Utah . law already prohibits anyone younger than 19 from possessing the . products or anyone from selling the products to someone younger than 19, . but because of a loophole, county and city agencies are not able to . impose fines or penalties on those selling e-cigarettes or dissolvable . tobacco products to anyone underage. Proposal: Senator Paul Ray considers electronic cigarettes similar to other tobacco products and says they should be taxed as such . The electronic cigarettes would be taxed at 86 percent, Ray said. That's the same as Utah's rate on cigars, roll-your-own tobacco or pipe tobacco. On cigarettes, the state tax is generally a flat $1.70 for a pack of 20 smokes. It usually costs about $50 to buy the equipment to get started using electronic cigarettes, said Brandon Stauffer, who has used the devices to quit smoking. After that, the main cost is buying the 'e-juice,' which is a nicotine-laced liquid that becomes the vapor when heated. A 30-milliliter dose usually costs $15-$20 and lasts about two weeks, Stauffer said. So, under Ray's proposal, a $20 batch . of liquid nicotine would cost about $37.20. Currently, people only pay . regular sales tax on electronic cigarette items. A legislative analysis shows the state could see an additional $1.6 million a year if the e-cigarette tax becomes law. It's unclear how far the measure will get in this year's legislative session, which comes to a close Thursday. An . amended version of the bill passed through a House committee Wednesday . afternoon. It is now awaiting debate by the full House. If approved, it . moves to the Senate for consideration. Electronic . cigarettes are touted as a way to break an addiction to traditional . cigarettes. Stauffer, 38, of West Point, Utah, is among the believers. Reduced costs: It usually costs about $50 to buy the equipment to get started using electronic cigarettes, said Brandon Stauffer, who has used the devices to quit smoking . He credits the devices with helping him quit smoking after 20 years. He had tried quitting a dozen different times using nicotine patches, gum and lozenges. 'Quitting smoking has never been easier. I quit almost overnight,' said Stauffer. 'Cigarettes taste horrible to me now. And, I'm doing much less harm to my body by doing this.' Since he started using electronic cigarettes in late 2011, Stauffer has gradually been cutting back on the amount of liquid nicotine in the devices. He's hoping to be able to stop using them all together within a year. 'Vilifying these products is the wrong approach,' Stauffer said. 'If the state and this country is serious about helping us make healthy choices then this is something that should be encouraged.'","Popularity of 'e-cigarettes' booming, from a few thousand users in 2006 to a predicted $1billion in sales this year .

Thomas ‘Slab’ Murphy, the former IRA chief of staff, is thought to have been tipped off just hours before a major cross-border police raid. Authorities believe that Murphy and his associates knew about the raid and allegedly destroyed computers and documents before the Garda pounced last Wednesday morning. A number of large fires were seen close to Murphy’s home in Ballybinaby, County Louth, at around 2am that day and, salvaged from the embers, were the burnt remains of laptops, documents and computer disks. 'Tipped-off': Thomas 'Slab' Murphy and his associates are thought to have known about a major cross-border police raid hours before the Garda arrived at his house and more than 22 homes and business premises . Sixty-year-old Murphy, who was named under privilege as an IRA chief of staff during a Smithwick Tribunal in 2011, was questioned but not arrested shortly after the raid as he drove away from his home, which is just six feet inside the border. At 6am, Operation Loft got underway as SWAT teams from the Garda Emergency Response Unit and the PSNI surrounded Murphy’s home, along with Air Corps and British Army helicopters. Led by the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in Dublin, a team of 300 have been involved in the investigation into the illegal fuel trade which has seen searches in 11 countries. In the raid of over 22 homes and business premises, more than €100,000 in cash and a huge number of documents were seized. One of the largest suspected diesel laundering plants ever discovered was also found. The Irish Independent reported that the plant could produce more than €5million worth of illegal fuel a year. Some 40,000 litres of fuel was also found at the premises. Cross-border raid: As Operation Loft got underway, SWAT teams from the Garda Emergency Response Unit and the PSNI surrounded Murphy's home and two tankers were seized . On raid day: A number of large fires were seen close to Murphy's home in Ballybinaby on the day of the raid and police salvaged the burnt remains of laptops, documents and computer disks . The investigation has found that a reported €100million had been generated and laundered in the last 18 months alone from the sale of laundered diesel, through an intricate network of bank accounts in made-up names. More than €1.6million in bank accounts in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Britain and Europe has been frozen already. The Belfast Telegraph quoted a source saying: 'This investigation has been ongoing for several years. 'It is just like a jigsaw and the final pieces in that puzzle are now being put in place.' The fuel laundering operation sells laundered diesel which has had its colour marker washed out in order to avoid VAT payments. In a statement the Criminal Assets Bureau said: ‘This illegal activity has knock on effects on legitimate businesses as well as on unsuspecting customers who have very often experienced damage to the fuel system of their vehicles (from laundered diesel) or poor return per litre of petrol.’ Concerned by compromise: One of the tankers removed from Murphy's house after the raid but authorities are said to be worried about a possible 'tip-off' which allowed evidence to be destroyed before the early morning raid . Authorities are said to be 'very concerned' by the prospect of their operation having been compromised, a security source was reported saying in the Irish Independent. The source said: ‘They seemed to know that a raid was imminent but they now have to explain why this burning took place. It is expected that the amount of money frozen will rise dramatically as the investigation continues and more accounts are discovered, it was reported. In a separate case, Murphy is currently facing nine allegations of failing to file income tax returns from 1996 to 2004 before the Special Criminal Court and his family is also contesting a €5million tax bill from the CAB.","Fires were seen near Thomas 'Slab' Murphy's home before the raid .

Worrying: Children's charity the NSPCC has found children as young as five are being reported to the police over sex offences, and it blames online pornography for a rise in under-18s accused of crimes (file picture) Children as young as five are being reported to the police over sex offences, a charity warned last night. The NSPCC blamed the shocking statistics on the growing ease of access to online pornography that ‘warps’ young people’s minds. More than 5,000 formal investigations have been launched over the past three years into under-18s accused of crimes including rape and sexual assault, according to statistics obtained by the charity. It blamed the rise on hardcore porn that is readily available on the internet, warping youngsters’ ideas about sex and relationships. The NSPCC’s findings reveal that the number of sex offences allegedly committed by under-18s has gone up 38 per cent from 1,432 in 2009/10 to 1,978 in 2011/12. It means that every day police are dealing with at least five children accused of sex offences. But the startling numbers may be the tip of the iceberg because many police forces – including some of the biggest such as the Metropolitan Police – did not reply to the charity’s Freedom of Information request. Three of the forces that did respond – Humberside, Cambridgeshire and Avon and Somerset – said their youngest cases of ‘harmful sexual behaviour’ had involved children aged five. Others reported cases of youngsters aged six, seven or eight being questioned. Because they are under ten, the age of criminal responsibility, these children cannot be charged. It is not known what offences the youngest children were accused of committing, but harmful sexual behaviour ranges from indecent exposure and inappropriate touching at one end of the scale, to rape and sexual assault at the other. It also covers forcing and coercing other people into watching or taking part in inappropriate or harmful sexual behaviour. The NSPCC said it was likely the youngest children were guilty of the less serious offences, or were victims of abuse who were copying behaviour to which they had been subjected. The Daily Mail has been calling for an automatic block on adult material on the web as part of its Block Online Porn campaign. Ministers have pledged to introduce a less stringent filtering system for all new computers, but no timetable has yet been imposed on internet service providers, meaning children are still at risk. Increase: The charity's findings reveal the number of sex offences allegedly committed by under-18s has gone up 38 per cent from 1,432 in 2009/10 to 1,978 in 2011/12 (file picture) Only last week, a 15-year-old boy was convicted of raping a 14-year-old girl after becoming obsessed with online porn. The girl was bound, gagged, beaten up and raped as he tried to re-enact sadistic scenes he had viewed on the internet. Her father demanded ministers take action to protect children from adult material online, particularly the ‘extreme violent nature’ of some easily accessible sites. But the NSPCC’s figures show that the situation is more widespread than it was thought, and is getting worse. Claire Lilley, policy adviser at the NSPCC, said: ‘We hope our findings will ring alarm bells with the authorities that this is a problem which needs urgent attention. In some cases older children are attacking younger ones and in other cases it’s sexual violence within a teenage relationship. Campaign: The Daily Mail has been calling for an automatic block on adult material on the web as part of its Block Online Porn campaign (file picture) ‘While more research needs to be done on this problem, we know that technology and easy access to sexual material is warping young people’s views of what is normal or acceptable behaviour. ‘We are treating an increasing number of children who have carried out online grooming, harassment in chatrooms and “sexting”.’ John Carr, from the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, said: ‘It’s very alarming to realise that children as young as five are being caught up in the consequences of the sexualisation of modern Britain. ‘The impact of this on a child of five will potentially live with them and scar them for the rest of  their lives.’ The scale of sexual offences committed by children was revealed after the NSPCC approached all 43 police forces in England and Wales, and received responses from 34 of them. A total of 5,028 offences categorised as ‘harmful sexual behaviour’ were recorded between 2009/10 and 2011/12 where the perpetrator was under 18. West Midlands, Greater Manchester and the Metropolitan Police in London were among those unable to give data – meaning the real total will be far higher. Figures from those that did respond show that 98 per cent of the 4,562 offenders were boys. And where the relationship was recorded, at least three out of five of the victims knew the abuser. More than one third of the offences were said to have been committed by a family friend or acquaintance, and one in five by family members. The NSPCC, which provides treatment to help reform children who exhibit signs of harmful sexual behaviour, said easy access to indecent material may be behind the increase in the numbers being treated. Miss Lilley said: ‘Evidence shows that most young people who receive behaviour-changing treatment early on will not continue to sexually abuse others or grow into adult offenders.’ The largest number of offences was recorded by Avon and Somerset police, with 633 over the past three years, closely followed by Humberside on 595. Next was Suffolk with 351 offences, followed by South Wales, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Northumbria, which each recorded 250 or more offences. Last year Sue Berelowitz, the deputy children’s commissioner, told MPs that online porn was turning children into sex attackers. She said: ‘It has definitely affected children’s thresholds of what they think is normal.’","More than 5,000 investigations launched over the past three years .

Jailed: Mahdi Mohammed was sentenced to 27 months in prison after he groomed two schoolgirls for sex via Facebook . An Iraqi-born paedophile, who has been jailed for grooming 13-year-old girls for sex via Facebook, avoided deportation in 2005, it has been revealed. Questions are now being asked about why the UK Border Agency allowed Mahdi Mohammed to seek asylum in Britain after he first appeared in court charged with inappropriately approaching girls as young as ten back in 2005. This week Mohammed, 33, was jailed for 27 months after he admitted sexual activity with a child, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, attempting to sexually touch a child and possessing indecent images at Peterborough Crown Court in Cambridgeshire. Judge Nic Madge described his crimes as ‘sophisticated offending,’ plying schoolgirls with mobile phone top-up vouchers. When he was caught he blamed them for ‘making themselves available’ to him. Claire Matthews, prosecuting, said Mohammed was seen hanging around a playground in Peterborough where he met two 13-year-old girls on a number of occasions. He gave them mobile phone top-up vouchers, offered to take them home, and tried to put his hand down one of the girl’s trousers. He also showed the girls pornographic TV channels and encouraged them to take part in sexual activity. Avoided deportation: Questions are now being asked about why the UK Border Agency allowed Iraqi-born Mohammed to seek asylum in Britain after he was charged with inappropriately approaching girls as young as ten back in 2005 . He sent indecent Facebook messages to one of them and even posted a memory stick to her home and asked her to put pictures of herself on it. He also sexually touched a 15-year-old in another park and had 19 indecent images of children on his computer. 'Sophisticated offending': Mohammed met two 13-year-old girls at a Peterborough playground, offering to take them home and trying to put his hands down one of girl's pants . Lawrence Bruce, defending, said: ‘He came to the UK in 2000, having fled persecution from Saddam Hussein in Iraq. ‘Admitting guilt publicly has been a very difficult process, and has involved the loss of faith, character and reputation.’ After . reading a letter from Mohammed, Judge Nic Madge said: ‘The letter is . disturbing in two senses. 'Firstly, the account of treatment of your . family in Iraqi Kurdistan, but also allegations that young girls were . making themselves available in a sexual manner to you.’ Mohammed first appeared at Peterborough Crown Court in September 2005 when he admitted using inappropriate language towards young girls in the city. He was sentenced to 80 hours of community punishment and a 12-month rehabilitation order and also got an ASBO banning him from approaching young girls for five years. At the time, the court was told that Mohammed’s application for asylum had been refused and he would be returned to Iraq. But the Border Agency confirmed today that he was granted leave to stay in Britain shortly after the case and was legally here when he committed the latest offences. 'Disturbing' letter: Judge Nic Madge told Mohammed at Peterborough Crown Court (pictured) that a letter from him was troubling because in it he alleged that the girls 'made themselves available' to him . 'Appalling case': Conservative MP Shailesh Vara, said serious questions needed to be asked about why he was allowed to stay since 2005 . They refused to say why Mohammed had been allowed to stay in the country. Shailesh Vara, Conservative MP for North West Cambridgeshire, said: ‘This is an appalling case. 'Serious questions need to be asked as . to why despite the asylum application having previously failed, the UK . Border Agency allowed him to stay. ‘The sooner this man is deported the better.’ Tory MP for Peterborough Stewart Jackson added that it was ‘appalling’ Mohammed had not been deported in 2005. He said: ‘This is a shocking case and is typical of the previous government’s lax and dangerous policy of unrestricted immigration. ‘This man should have been removed from the UK in 2005 and the fact that he wasn’t is appalling. ‘I will be writing to the Immigration Minister to ensure that he is permanently removed from our country after his prison sentence is served.’ The Border Agency said that Mohammed would now be deported at the end of his prison sentence.","Mahdi Mohammed was jailed for 27 months at Peterborough Crown Court .

Whatever she wants to do, if we can make it happen, we will do it. ‘We always carry a camera with us as we want to get memories of Abbie all the time and we're always doing something.’ Life-saving surgery: Abbie (pictured with mother Tracy Pears in hospital) had to undergo surgery aged just 13-weeks-old after the serious heart defect was discovered . Living on 'borrowed time': Abbie (pictured left aged four months and right aged two) must one day have a full heart transplant when it is anticipated her heart will fail and so her family makes 'every day count', says mother Ms Pears . Abbie’s serious heart defect, hypoplastic right heart syndrome, was not discovered until she was six-weeks-old. Parents Ms Pears and Gary Bayes, 46, first learned something was wrong when a routine check-up detected their daughter had a heart murmur. Subsequent tests and examinations revealed that she had the condition and would need intensive treatment at the region's children's heart unit to survive. It came as a shock to the family as the pregnancy had gone smoothly and Abbie was born a healthy baby at the University Hospital of North Durham, weighing 7lb 10oz. Ms Bayes said: ‘When we were first told that Abbie had heart failure I immediately thought that she was not going to make it. ‘It came as a shock as she looked like any other child her age and was doing everything that you would expect a baby to do.’ Mr Bayes has a heart defect and so Ms Pears had undergone an extra pregnancy scan to see if her daughter also had a problem with the organ. Shock diagnosis: Born a healthy baby, it came as a shock when Abbie was diagnosed with the condition which kills many babies within days of being born, but she has proved to be a determined little girl, undergoing surgery again when she was four (pictured) However, all scans came back clear and it was thought that Abbie was growing and developing as expected. Abbie's serious complex congenital condition puts added pressure on the working side of the heart as it compensates for the damaged side. This added pressure will eventually lead to organ failure, when she will need a heart transplant. Abbie finds it difficult to walk up stairs as she easily gets out of breath and her lips and fingernails often . turn blue due to the lower oxygen levels in her blood. 'Centre of attention': Abbie 'has a mind of her own' says Ms Pears (pictured together with brothers Charlie, left, 10, and Harry, five) It is anticipated that Abbie will need a heart transplant in the future and will then spend a lifetime on anti-rejection medication. Abbie's siblings Siobhan, 25, Craig, 23, Charlie, 10, and Harry, five, do not have any heart problems. But despite all she has gone through, Abbie is a determined girl. Ms Pears said: ‘Abbie has a mind of her own and loves being the centre of attention. She is a real girly girl. She is very confident. ‘I can't put into words how great the team is at the Freeman's children's heart unit as they do an outstanding job. ‘They give you so much confidence that your child is going to get the best care possible and that everything will be done to help.’","Abbie Bayes was born with heart defect hypoplastic right hear syndrome .

A former councillor has been spared jail after beating his 80-year-old neighbour with a crutch in a row over cleaning wheelie bins and cutting grass. Barry Ross, 66, was instead given a curfew after hitting Malcolm Daniel three times as he lay on the ground after falling over during the attack. Elderly neighbours in Ravenfield, Rotherham, have started a petition to order the eviction of Ross because they see him as a nuisance and say they are afraid of him. Beat neighbour: Barry Ross (pictured), a former councillor, hit pensioner Malcolm Daniel three times with his crutch after he fell to the ground, the court heard . Deputy District Judge Helen Cousins told . Ross, an ex-Liberal Democrat councillor, that if he had been a younger . man or had a record of violence, he would have been given a jail . sentence. Rotherham Magistrates’ Court heard that Ross told police that Mr Daniel had approached him from behind and tapped him, which led him to believe that he was being attacked in October last year. Judge Cousins said: ‘You didn't see who it was, but instinctively you struck behind you with your crutch. ‘When you turned, Mr Daniel was there and you accept you tried to take hold of him and he fell to the floor and then you accept that you struck Mr Daniel three times with your crutch when he was on the floor. 'Imprison you at home': The judge told Ross that if he was younger or had a history of violence, he would have got a jail term, instead he was handed a curfew . ‘There was something which provoked . you to behave this way. However, an elderly man on the floor being hit . with an implement is very serious. ‘If . you were a young man or had a record of any violence then this would be . a case of custody, but I am going to imprison you at home and deal with . you in the community.’ Ross, who walked into court with the aid of two crutches, confirmed this version of events by simply saying: ‘Correct.’ Ross pleaded guilty and was handed a curfew order. The judge added that Ross's account was not ‘materially different’ from that of his victim and that she needed to hear no further evidence before passing sentence on one charge of assault by beating. She said: ‘Unpaid work is not appropriate, given (Ross's) age and disability. It might be that a curfew is appropriate.’ Another of Ross's neighbours, who refused to be identified, said that Ravenfield's elderly residents were afraid of him. A petition has been signed by 20 residents branding him a nuisance neighbour and demanding he is evicted. Asked by the judge whether he had anything to say for himself, Ross accepted that he could have handled his confrontation with Mr Daniel without violence. Ross said: ‘I would like to forget the whole issue and I can only apologise to the bench profusely.' Despite what his neighbours said, Ross added: ‘I . am not an aggressive person and I can only apologise for the . inconvenience that this has caused you this morning. I would adhere to a . curfew, obviously.’ Neighbourly squabble: Ross's confrontation with Mr Daniel is thought to have come about after an argument over the cutting of grass and washing of wheelie bins on the cul-de-sac road they live on (pictured) After consulting with probation service officers, the judge sentenced Ross to a four-month curfew confining him to his home between 7pm and 7am. Ross, who set up his own political group called the John Lilburne Democratic Party, was also made the subject of a restraining order which banned him from approaching Mr Daniel or witnesses to the incident for two years. The judge told him: ‘This hangs over your head for two years and if you break the conditions you will be sent to prison.’ Mistaken identity: Rotherham Magistrates' Court (pictured) heard that Ross told police that Mr Daniel had approached him from behind and tapped him, which led him to believe that he was being attacked . The judge also ordered Ross to pay court costs of £100 and compensation to Mr Daniel of £200. Mr Daniel's daughter Jill Dungworth, 53, said that the family were ‘very disappointed’ with the sentence. She said: ‘It's disgusting. I don't think my dad's the same person since the attack and Ross has just got to pay £300. ‘It's shocking to think that if he were 50-years-old he would have gone to prison.’","Barry Ross, 66, attacked Malcolm Daniel, 80, in Ravenfield, South Yorkshire .

This photograph of a Thai woman sitting on top of a dead rhino with a rifle in hand is a 'fake hunt' photo allowing poachers to get away with their illegal wildlife trade, authorities believe. Authorities say that she is one of the women allegedly hired by a Laotian wildlife trafficking gang to pose as hunters - who are allowed to kill a limited number of rhinos and keep the horns as trophies - in order to circumvent the law, enabling their wildlife smuggling operations. The photograph, taken somewhere in South Africa, was released today by the Freeland Foundation who say that authorities and wildlife investigators from several countries have joined forces in an operation aimed at breaking down the animal trading network which connects African wildlife and the Asian market. 'Fake hunt' photo: Authorities say that this Thai woman was allegedly hired by a Laotian wildlife trafficking gang to pose as hunters - who are allowed to kill a limited number of rhinos and keep the horns as trophies - in order to circumvent the law . Rhino horn is now worth more than £37,000 a kilo, fetching more on the black market than diamonds and cocaine, leading to a surge of poaching in South Africa to record highs last year. It is particularly sought after in Vietnam. The New York Times reported that there was strong evidence that a man, who they allege is a linchpin of wildlife trafficking, uses this technique of hiring people to pose with dead rhinos to aid his illegal trade. South African authorities said his wildlife trading company in Laos had committed ‘one of the biggest swindles in environmental crime history’ by creating these photographs, according to the New York Times. Booming trade: A stash of illegal ivory found in Kenya as poaching levels in Africa hit record levels . It is believed that he is . linked to Thai national Chumlong Lemtongthai who was sentenced to 40 . years in jail by for shipping large quantities of rhino horns to Asia . for ‘selfish financial gain’ in November last year. Chumlong, 44, paid prostitutes $800 . for the ‘fake hunt’ photographs which saw them go to game farms and pose . next to rhinos killed by others to provide proof the horns were . souvenirs. Judge Prince . Manyathi said Chumlong fraudulently obtained hunting permits to kill 26 . rhinos and then shipped most of the horns to Asia to sell for a profit. Chumlong Lemtongthai was sentenced to 40 years jail last year for shipping large quantities of rhino horns to Asia for 'selfish financial gain' ‘The shooting was not for trophy hunting. It was for horn trading,’ Manyathi said, adding rhinos were a symbol of the country and continent. Between October 2010 and May 2011, more than two dozen rhinos were killed on licensed 'hunts' arranged by Chumlong. The horns were mounted as trophies and sent to the owner of the wildlife trading company in Laos. Kenyan officials have also made links from the company to the smuggling of elephant tusks as well. He has been linked by investigators and government officials in several countries to the illegal trade which has seen the illegal killings of elephants and rhinoceroses in Africa and destruction of other species in Asian jungles. Rhino horn is just one part of a trade worth an estimated 19 billion US dollars (£12 billion), making it the fourth biggest global illegal trade after narcotics, counterfeiting and human trafficking. The trade of exotic wildlife has experienced a boom in China and Vietnam because of their increasing wealth. Poaching has hit record levels in . South Africa where, by mid-October, 455 rhinos had been killed . illegally. There were 448 in 2011. Among . the reasons for the trade is demand for medicines, consumer goods and . the desire to possess exotic pets, hunting trophies and rare plants and . animals, the study suggested. Illegal wildlife trade thrives in places . with widespread corruption, weak law enforcement and where rangers, . police officers and customs officials are not sufficiently trained or . resourced with new tools such as DNA tracing technology. Costly commodity: Rhino horn is now worth more than £37,000 a kilo, fetching more on the black market than diamonds and cocaine. It is particularly sought after in Vietnam . A report by the WWF warned that species with high value to illegal traders had seen dramatic declines in recent years, including forest elephants in parts of the Congo basin, Asian elephant, Sumatran rhino and Javan rhino. WWF's wildlife trade expert Heather Sohl warned the species could face localised extinctions if poaching continued at that level. She said of the threats to animals such as elephants, rhinos and tigers: 'These are iconic species, they are being exploited and it's illegal and should be stopped.' In February a month-long operation involving police, customs and wildlife officers from Asia, Africa and the U.S. was carried out to dismantle organised wildlife crime syndicates. Hundreds of arrests were made and an assortment of wildlife specimens were seized including 22 rhino horns and four rhino horn carvings, 6,500kg of elephant ivory, 2,600 live snakes, 10 tiger and seven leopard trophies and 31kg of elephant meat. Fire arms and ammunition was also recovered from the poachers in Operation COBRA, according to Freeland. Senior Superintendent, Uttam Kumar Karkee, from Nepalese Police said: ‘Operation COBRA has proven itself to be an excellent model for fighting trans-national crime.’ Investigations: Kenyan officials have also made links from Vixay Keosavang's wildlife trading company Xaysavang Trading to the smuggling of elephant tusks as well .","Authorities say she was allegedly hired by a Laotian wildlife trafficking gang .

Om, 55, a former Regimental Sergeant Major with the Gurkha Signals, was left devastated after the theft from a cabinet displaying the medals in his restaurant Crossed Khukris, late last Sunday night. Om received an MBE from the Queen in 1997 for his services as the last Gurkha regimental sergeant major during the handover of Hong Kong.

Today a massive search operation was underway in her home village of Burscough, near Ormskirk, Lancashire into the disappearance of the mother of three who told loved ones she wanted to ‘clear her head’. Mrs Simpson - who also has two young boys and is married to husband Philip - suffered from post-natal depression following the birth of her daughter in November last year and police say they are ‘very concerned’ for her welfare. More than 170 people are involved in the search including 70 police officers plus mountain rescue teams, police divers, the force helicopter and volunteers. In a statement Mrs Simpson's sister Clair Dobrec, who has flown in from her home in Western Australia to help with the search, said: ‘We are devastated by Karen's disappearance which is very out of character. ‘She has now been missing for over 48 hours and the whole family are extremely concerned for her welfare. ‘She is the mother of the children, the youngest is only three-months-old. Karen has been suffering from post-natal depression, for which she was receiving help, and as such we are very concerned for her welfare. ‘Karen, we know you haven't been feeling well and we want you to know that we're all here to support you.

Participants' adventures are captured in this stunning set of pictures taken by event organiser Scott Rogers, 25, who started the annual gathering as a way of getting his friends from around the globe together each year. He said: 'People are often all over the world doing their thing so it's a place we can all get together and let off steam and have some fun. 'It started out as something really informal with about 20 people at the first event. 'As the years went on we continued to host the event and word-of-mouth, as well as the beautiful pictures we captured every year, helped it to grow in popularity. 'This year was the biggest yet with more than 100 people attending from lots of different countries.'

The festival lasts for ten days but the first two days are devoted to getting ropes and equipment set up. This year, it got off to a dramatic start with one of the 130 people who attended had to be carried down the mountain and airlifted to hospital after picking up an injury. Scott, from Denver, Colorado, added: 'Fortunately she was okay and the rest of us were able to do some really great highlining and BASE jumping during the festival just as I hoped. 'It's just a full on week of absolute shenanigans - it's unbelievable.'

Annual gathering: Scott Rogers started the festival as a way of getting his friends from all around the world together once a year . He was so amazed by it that he forgot to compete and just slacklined all day. He said: 'At the festival, which has taken the name Turkey Boogie, the community comes together and creates a space where people can do these dangerous things with the help and support of others. 'For an entire week we walk highlines at or above our ability level. We take falls, we get back up, we try again, we walk across. 'The feeling of doing something both physically and mentally difficult is taken to the next level when you have the support of your friends. 'Spending time here is just unbelievable.

A flurry of preparations is being made in the hope that Britain’s only two giant pandas will mate. With the female panda only in season for less than 48 hours and the success rate in captivity notoriously low, the pressure for female Tian Tian and male Yang Guang at Edinburgh Zoo is immense. Zoo staff and experts, brought in from Berlin, are doing all they can to prepare the pair including playing relaxing music in Yang Guang’s pen and managing a strict diet and training regime for both of them. Panda preparations: It is hoped that Britain's only two giant pandas - female Tian Tian (left) and male Yang Guang (right) - will mate and preparations are taking place at Edinburgh Zoo in the hope it will be a success . If they succeed, the pandas’ cubs will become the first born in the UK, but it will also be a significant step in the fight to save the endangered species – there are just 1,500 remaining in the wild. Already both pandas have started to show important changes in their behaviour which are encouraging signs that they are ready to mate soon. Physical changes suggest that the ideal date for mating will be Easter Sunday. The nine-year-old pair arrived from China at the Scottish zoo in December 2011 but previous mating attempts have not been successful. As a contingency plan, experts from Berlin have been brought in to perform artificial insemination on Tian Tian as well as the hoped natural mating. Iain Valentine, director of giant pandas at Edinburgh Zoo, said of the two methods being used: ‘This follows the best practice methodology adopted by other panda-keeping zoos around the world and gives our giant pandas the best possible chance of success.’ Body weight in food: The male is being fed more bamboo to increase his stamina. He is currently eating 110lbs a day but this will be increased to 220lb, his whole body weight in bamboo . Small window of opportunity: Tian Tian will be in season for less than 48 hours and females are also known to be very selective on their mates, making the act of mating a very difficult process . It is hoped the pandas will bear and rear cubs during their 10-year stay at the zoo. The success rate of breeding giant pandas in captivity has been notoriously low. Few zoos outside China have managed to achieve results. Females are in season for such a small window and are also known to be very selective on their mates. Tian Tian, which means sweetie, and Yang Guang, which means sunshine, have been kept apart for their mating preparations since their unsuccessful attempt last year. Yang Guang is being trained to stand on his hind quarters to strength his legs in preparation for doing the deed, which lasts just two minutes. Reunion: The pandas have been able to glimpse each other through a grate as their reunion approaches in an attempt to 'tease' them. They will be gradually introduced to each other as the date approaches . A whistle and rewards such as carrots and apples have been used to encourage him to stand. Tian . Tian is also being trained to stand so zoo keepers can perform . ultrasound scans to monitor her ovaries and womb, and hopefully the . pregnancy. She has also been trained to urinate on cue making it easier . for keepers to get samples to detect changes in her hormone levels which . can indicate when the right moment for mating will be. Indoor . light timers have been fitted in both their pens to mimic outside . sunlight levels so both pandas can undergo physiological changes at the . same time. The male is . being fed more bamboo to increase his stamina. He is currently eating . 110lbs a day but this will be increased to 220lb which is almost his . whole body weight in food. Mr Valentine told The Sunday Telegraph: ‘It is physically demanding for the male, as though he has got weight and power on his side, the female does not make it easy. Encouraging sign: Yang Guang recently started doing handstands against trees, walls and rocks, scent-marking as high up as possible, which is known as a display of virility in the wild . ‘We are training him to help him cope with that. ‘He has got to be physically, mentally and chemically pumped up.’ Tian Tian’s urine samples from when she was in season last year have been dabbed around Yang Guang’s pen to increase his hormone levels. In the wild, male pandas would track down the female in season by tracking the chemical signals given off by her urine. It also triggers hormonal and chemical changes in the male’s body. Smooth Radio is being played in his pen as well to relax him after his adjustment to his new home has been difficult. New Year’s fireworks, planes and high winds have unsettled him in the past. The pandas have also been able to glimpse each other through a grate as their reunion approaches in an attempt to ‘tease’ them. They will be gradually introduced to each other as the date approaches. Mating call: Tian Tian has already started calling out to the male which is common during breeding season, and her urine samples from when she was in season last year have been dabbed around Yang Guang's pen to increase his hormone levels . Yang Guang recently started doing handstands against trees, walls and rocks, scent-marking as high up as possible, which is known as a display of virility in the wild. Meanwhile Tian Tian has already started calling out to the male which is common during breeding season. Artificial insemination is fraught with danger for both pandas that will have to be put under general anaesthetic, but will be done to increase the chances of a successful mating season. Staff will then have to wait 180 days until cubs are born. Two incubators have been installed in at the zoo to give the cubs the best chance of surviving. Breeding in captivity has become vital to the giant pandas’ survival with the destruction of bamboo forests in China and south-east Asia. The pair are the first giant pandas to come to the UK in 17 years after a panda called Ming was sent back to China in 1994. Two pandas were sent to the UK from China in 1974 but were unsuccessful. Currently there are 36 pandas in 15 zoos and parks outside of China.","Female Tian Tian and male Yang Guang arrived from China in 2011 .

He went straight for the big one. ‘He often sits near us when there's food around and while we were eating bread and butter pudding Marie fed him some from her hand. ‘She was holding the spoon in her other hand and quick as a flash, Scooby went over thinking there might be food there too and took the spoon straight out of her hand. ‘When we saw that it wasn't in his mouth, we realised that he must have swallowed it but he didn't even flinch.

New evidence in the Jodi Arias trial shows that she may have been trying to influence the testimony of her friend by slipping out coded messages while she was in jail for her ex-boyfriend's murder.

The picture shows numbers written at the bottom of a page in her copy of Star Magazine, that were intended to match messages that she had written on the corresponding page numbers from the second magazine, Digital Photo Pro. 'You f***ed up what you told my attorney the next day / directly contradicts what I've been saying for over a year / get down here ASAP and see me before you talk to them again and before / you testify so / we can fix this / interview was excellent! Must talk ASAP!' the message read when pieced together. Scroll down for video . Grilling: Jodi Arias, pictured on the stand on Monday, gave testimony for the tenth day where she was harshly questioned by the prosecution over her various versions of events . The evidence is intended to show that . she tried to manipulate one of the few people who could theoretically . corroborate her story about being abused by Alexander. The date of the magazine incident and . the interviews scheduled around that time point to the prospect of the . recipient being her friend and former boyfriend Matt McCartney. When presented with the magazine codes on Thursday, Arias denied trying to sway McCartney. 'You tried to get someone to lie at that hearing, didn't you?' prosecutor Juan Martinez said. 'No, she responded. Her trust and the veracity of McCartney's knowledge was brought up again when the trial picked back up on Monday. His name was mentioned when she said that she showed bruises that she sustained from one of her fights with Alexander. 'I saw (McCartney) a few days later and he called me out on all the bruises that were on me,' she said in court. One-on-one: Prosecutor Juan Martinez (left) aggressively questioned Jodi Arias (right) last Thursday as cross-examination began . After going back and forth with . Martinez over the specific timing and driving directions that she went . through during this supposed trip- when she traveled from Alexander's . house in Mesa, Arizona to McCartney's house in Seaside, California, it . was eventually determined that he would not have been able to see the . bruising. Though the prosecutor asserts that it . was because of the timeline of the trip, she said that she also applied . multiple coats of makeup to avoid any questioning. The 32-year-old eventually admitted . that there is no physical evidence, documentary or anecdotal evidence . that Alexander hurt her. Martinez also questioned her motive in . moving to Mesa after she and Arias had officially broken up. She went . on to say that Alexander was very 'persuasive' and convinced her to . still move even though they were no longer together. Arias' grueling tenth day on the stand was part of criminal proceedings that have been going on since early January. Arias, 32, lost a bid last week aimed . at getting a reprieve from a potential death sentence if convicted of . first-degree murder after the Arizona Supreme Court swiftly denied her . motion that claimed a detective committed perjury in the case. Her . attorneys have filed multiple motions for mistrials, all of which have . been denied. Negotiations: The prosecution and defense have fought bitter battles over evidence and approached the judge's bench on several occasions on Monday . Earlier in Monday's testimony, Arias . was grilled about her decision to send Alexander's grieving grandmother . flowers following his murder. The court viewed a tape of Arias' 48 . Hours interview where she said that she had sent the flowers to . Alexander's grandmother 'because iris was one of Travis' 'favorite baby . names'. She went on to send an 18-page note to his siblings. In the note, she said that they . 'deserved to know' who killed their brother by shooting him and stabbing . him 27 times. She left out any mention of her involvement- which she . has now admitted to in court. The prosecutor asked why she lied to . Detective Flores when she denied being in Arizona on June 4, 2008. Arias . said she had lied because she was ashamed of things that she and . Alexander had done in the past that she wanted to keep secret. Martinez kept at Arias over her . motives for lying. He picked apart her often contradictory responses and . questioned her memory of events, even opening his examination on the . tenth day of the trial by asking: 'Ma'am, you have a problem with . telling the truth, don't you?' The lawyer then picked apart each of the versions of events that Arias had told to friends following Mr Alexander's murder. Previous stories: Jodi Arias sat down for multiple interviews with 48 Hours Mystery shortly after being arrested but her version of event has changed dramatically since then . Her former self: The clips have been played for the court and Arias had to answer for her previous responses . Smiling: Arias, pictured in her mugshot center, was asked why she chose to smile in her booking photo and in the 48 Hours interview she said it was because she thought it is what Alexander would have done . Arias was grilled on her conflicting . testimony on Monday where she both appeared to say that she knew and . didn't know Alexander was dead when she left his Mesa home on June 4. She told the jury that her 'mind . wasn't right' as to why she had could not remember clearly the events or . why she had been covered in blood when she drove from Arizona to Utah . to visit a romantic interest, Ryan Burns. Martinez said: 'And to continue this litany of lies, it isn't restricted to Utah. You also lied to people in Arizona.' She responded: 'I lied to everyone.' When Arias was told by friend Daniel . Freeman that her former boyfriend had been murdered, she pretended she . knew nothing about it. She then called a spiritual adviser . Bishop Leighton to find out what he knew about Alexander's death, a move . that Martinez claimed was 'to see if someone was on to you'. The murder suspect then added that she could not remember much from that day of June 4. Referring to the fateful day at . Alexander's house Martinez asked: 'You remembered the confrontation, you . remembered that you didn't call 911, so why did you need to know . second-hand knowledge? Last week, prosecutor Martinez . hammered Arias with intense questioning about her inability to recall . crucial details in the case, yet noted it was puzzling that she can . remember 'what kind of coffee you bought at Starbucks sometime back in . 2008'. Despondent: It was another day under close scrutiny for the murder suspect in the Arizona courtroom . Damning words: Pages for Arias' own diary were used by the prosecution to contradict claims that Alexander had been physically violent towards her during their relationship . Arias smirked at times while Martinez . stammered in frustration, and the judge admonished both to stop talking . over each other as the questioning grew heated and the two traded barbs. Arias first told authorities she knew . nothing about Alexander's death, then later blamed it on masked . intruders before eventually settling on self-defense. She said she was scared of being . arrested, had been contemplating suicide and didn't want to sully . Alexander's name with accounts of his violent behavior and lurid details . of their sexual relationship, given his public persona as a devout . Mormon who was saving himself for marriage. Of the day she killed Alexander, Arias . says she remembers him in a rage, body slamming her and chasing her . around his home. She said she grabbed a gun from his closet, and fired . it as they tussled, but didn't know if she hit him. Doomed: Jodi Arias is accused of murdering her on-off lover Travis Alexander which she claims was in self-defense while the prosecution says she flew into a jealous rage . She had no explanation for the 27 stab . and slash wounds he suffered, or his slit throat, or how his body ended . up stuffed in his shower. According to court records, however, . she previously told police before her trial began that Alexander was . unconscious after she shot him, but then 'crawled around and was . stabbed'. She says she remembers putting a knife . in the dishwasher and disposing of the gun in the desert as she drove . from Arizona on her way to Utah. She immediately began planning an . alibi. Arias' grandparents reported a .25 . caliber handgun stolen from their Northern California house about a week . before the killing - the same caliber used to shoot Alexander - but . Arias claims to know nothing about the burglary. She says she brought no . weapons to Alexander's home on the day she killed him, undercutting the . prosecution's theory of premeditation.","Tried to pass messages along to her friend and former flame Matt McCartney after he 'f***** up' by telling investigators a statement that contradicted her claims .

The prosecutor also showed the . bloodied and torn leopard print spaghetti strap dress that Astley was . wearing on the day she died. The site of the dress made her mother, Mary . Dunne, weep. Earlier in the trial, Fujita's uncle and cousin were taken onto the stand. The uncle, Phillip Saba, said that he . voted 'nothing unusual' in Fujita's demeanor at their family fourth of . July barbeque the day after the murder. Trial: Nathaniel Fujita, right, and defense attorney William Sullivan watch July 3, 2011, security camera video footage of Lauren Astley ascending an escalator at the Natick Mall . Mother: Mary Dunn sobbed quietly in the gallery as the CCTV footage was shown to the court earlier in the trial and on Wednesday she wept again when her daughter's last outfit . Victim: Phone records show that 18-year-old Lauren talked to Nathanial several times before going to meet him after she finished work at the local mall . The more damning evidence came from . his cousin Caroline Saba who said that he specifically said 'They're not . going to find a weapon there if that's what you mean.' Fujita was arrested after a search of . his family's home found blood in the garage and his clothing - which was . stained with blood - stashed in the attic. Fujita was spotted driving shirtless, . car windows down and music blaring, mere moments after allegedly dumping . the 18-year-old's body, according to the filings. Prosecutors allege Fujita made an . elaborate but failed attempt to cover up; police found bloody clothing . and sneakers in the Fujita home, in addition to a second pair of wet . sneakers and a sweatshirt with mud in the pockets. One of the biggest points of argument . is whether or not the murder was premeditated; the prosecution argues . that he actively planned the killing and tried to cover it up . afterwards, while the defense argues that he snapped. Murder trial: Nathanial Fujita and his ex girlfriend Lauren Astley both went to the same high school . Suspect: Prosecutors believe Fujita cut his ex-girlfriend's throat, strangled her with a bungee cord and dumped her body in a swamp . Prosecutors believe Fujita took . Astley’s Jeep Grand Cherokee from his home and drove it to the Wayland . Town Beach parking lot, then dumped the keys in a storm drain. Phone records show that as she . finished up her shift at a local store on the final day of her life, . Fujita and Lauren had a number of conversations and she told co-workers . that she was going to meet him after she left the mall. Her parents reported her missing shortly after she failed to return home from work that day.","Nathanial Fujita killed his ex-girlfriend Lauren Astley in July 2011 but his lawyers say it was during a mental episode .

The man who secretly filmed the infamous ’47 percent’ video of Mitt Romney has finally come forward and explained why he decided to wade into the presidential dogfight. Scott Prouty publicly admitted that he was the bartender who released the footage of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney speaking at a private fundraiser and he said that the motivating reason behind the move was so that all Americans could see the ‘true’ Romney. ‘Frankly the people that were there that night, they paid $50,000 per person for a dinner. I grew up in a blue collar area of Boston,’ Mr Prouty said in an interview with MSNBC’s Ed Schultz. ‘There's a lot of people who can’t afford to pay $50,000 for one night, for one dinner… I felt an obligation for all of the people who can't afford to be there. Scroll down for video . The man behind the movie: Scott Prouty is the bartender who filmed the infamous video of Mitt Romney making off-the-cuff remarks about 47 percent of the American public being entitled . ‘I knew where he came from, he was born with all of the advantages- he was the son of a Governor, a CFO, went to prep school and Harvard- and I don’t think he has any clue what a regular American goes through on a daily basis. The day in day out struggles of regular Americans that guy has no idea and I don’t think he will ever have any idea,’ he said. Mr Prouty said that he brought a camera to the event because he was never told not to, and he told Schultz that he was not the only one as a number of other staff members wanted to possibly have their picture taken with Romney after the event. Mr Prouty said that he had the camera set up behind the bar so that he could film his speech while tending to his bar duties, but once he realized that Romney’s talk at that May fundraiser ‘wasn’t just any other speech’. His attention was piqued when Romney walked into the room and quickly began ordering staff members around. Even though his comments that the workers should speed up their service was likely in jest, that still rubbed Mr Prouty the wrong way. Leaked: James Carter, an opposition researcher, said he found the video online and put reporters from the left-leaning U.S. website Mother Jones in touch with an unnamed individual who had shot the footage . Woops! The resulting outcry over Romney's remarks is still regarded as one of the main reasons why the Republican lost the race to the White House . ‘I can’t imagine demanding to be fed faster to be served faster,’ Mr Prouty said in an interview for The Ed Show. After that, Romney began talking about the military-style organization of a factory in China where one of his companies had outsourced some of its work. The former governor went on to describe how 12 young women were living in each of the small boarding rooms, in three-tiered bunk beds. ‘At this point I realized this was not your typical speech,’ Mr Prouty said. Mr Prouty thought that Romney’s views on the factory were the most outlandish, and reflective of what the candidate thought of practical work environments. ‘He just wandered through this horrendous place, and he thinks this is pretty good,’ Mr Prouty said. Reasoning: Mr Prouty, seen left being interviewed by MSNBC's Ed Schultz, said that he wanted to remain anonymous until after the election so that the focus stayed on the video and not on him . ‘He doesn’t care about the people who are out of work in the U.S. …. He’s a vulture capitalist who just doesn’t care on any level.’ From there, Romney went on to say the . infamous remark that critically damaged his campaign: ‘There are 47 per . cent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe . that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility . to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to . food, to housing, to you name it. That that's an entitlement. And the . government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president . no matter what.' Egalitarian: Mr Prouty said that he wanted the comments to be seen by all of the electorate, and not just those who paid $50,000 to attend the dinner . Once it truly hit home that this was not the average stump speech, Mr Prouty realized that his recording was potentially damaging to Romney’s campaign and he needed to protect it. At one point, he tossed a towel over the camera to make sure that no one spotted it. At another moment, he readjusted it’s position because a Secret Service agent was standing behind him. ‘I had no idea that it would be this big thing that it turned out to be,’ he said. Once he cleaned up the bar and the night ended, the portion that struck a chord with Mr Prouty was the comments Romney made about the Chinese factory, where he recalled the site was fenced in with barbed wire on top- not to keep the workers in but to keep overzealous job applicants out. Mr Prouty said that if he decided to release the video, he wanted to make sure that he had the proper facts behind him so that it stood up against critical tests, so he began reading up on Romney's visit to China and the questions raised about the Global Tech factory that he toured. That research lead him to David Corn, a journalist for liberal newsmagazine Mother Jones, as Mr Corn wrote an article about the factory. Mr Prouty reached out to Mr Corn's assistant, James Carter, and the group began to discuss the tape and the decision to publish it online. ‘People could decide for themselves whether they agreed with him or not but I thought it was my duty to make sure as many people saw it as possible. ‘I thought it could be a game changer, I thought maybe it could take him out.’ Mr . Prouty said that he is a registered independent but tends to vote for . Democratic candidates, and that the major reason why he debated for two . weeks about whether or not he should release the footage came from the . inevitable threat of backlash from conservative supporters. ‘I had offers - Today Show and this and that and the other as far away as Germany- and I thought it was absolutely the wrong thing to do. I thought that would change the topic of the conversation away from the subject to me,’ he said.","Scott Prouty announces that he was the bartender who filmed the Romney comments during a $50,000-per-plate fundraiser during the campaign .

"By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 06:18 EST, 14 September 2011 . Barack Obama is risking a clash with the U.S. federal judiciary by pushing through an unprecedented diversification of the system. Nearly three out of every four people the President has confirmed to the federal bench are women or minorities. His efforts are unique as he is the first U.S. president who has not selected a majority of white males for lifetime judgeships. Changing faces: Judge Sonia Sotomayor beams in 2009 as President Obama applauds her as her Supreme Court nomination is announced . More than 70 per cent of his confirmed judicial nominees during his first two years were ‘non-traditional,’ or non-white male nominees. That far exceeds the percentages in the two-term administrations of Bill Clinton at 48.1 per cent and George W. Bush at 32.9 per cent. ‘It is an absolutely remarkable diversity achievement,’ said Sheldon Goldman, author of the book Picking Federal Judges. Professor Goldman, of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, is only counting judges once - even if they fit more than one category. The White House has been touting its efforts to diversify the bench during Mr Obama's tenure. The President won Senate confirmation of the first Latina to the Supreme Court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Trailblazer: Senate last week confirmed the first African-American woman to sit on the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, Bernice Donald . And with the confirmation of Justice Elena Kagan he has put three women on the high court for the first time. The Obama administration also nominated and won confirmation of the first openly gay man to a federal judgeship. It was the former Clinton administration official J. Paul Oetken, who was confirmed to an opening in New York City. Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, praised that confirmation as a ‘critical step’ to increase diversity. The first openly homosexual federal judge was Deborah A. Batts in New York City, a lesbian nominated by Clinton in 1994. Of the 98 Obama nominees confirmed to date, the administration says 21 per cent are African-American and 11 per cent are Hispanic. Seven per cent are Asian-American and almost half - 47 percent - are women. By comparison, of the 322 judges confirmed during George W. Bush's presidency, 18 per cent were minorities and 22 per cent were female. Of the 372 judges confirmed during Clinton's terms, 25 per cent were minorities and 29 per cent were women. In these figures, some judges fit into more than one category. Better: President Obama's record of ‘non-traditional’ confirmed judicial nominees far exceeds that of former presidents Bill Clinton, left and George W. Bush, right . The Senate last week confirmed the first African-American woman to sit on the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, Bernice Donald. 'It is an absolutely remarkable diversity achievement' Sheldon Goldman, University of Massachusetts at Amherst . Earlier, she was the first African-American woman elected as a judge in Tennessee and appointed as federal bankruptcy judge in the nation. Mr Obama also has doubled the number of Asian-Americans sitting on the federal bench. Denny Chin was added to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York as the only active Asian federal appeals court judge. There currently are 14 Asian-American federal judges on the 810-judge roster. Obama has nominated as many as were sitting on the bench when he was inaugurated. For more than 140 years, there were no females or minorities among the nation's federal judges. The first female federal appellate judge was Florence Allen, who gained her seat on the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1934. The first female U.S. District Court judge was Burnita Shelton Matthews, who took the bench in Washington D.C. in 1950. Judges: The U.S. Supreme Court in 2010.

Reynaldo G. Garza became the first Hispanic federal judge when he was appointed to the U.S. District Court in Texas in 1961. 'The more diverse the courts, the more confidence people . have in our judicial system. Having a diverse judiciary also enriches the decision-making process' Nan Aron, Alliance for . Justice . Herbert Choy became the first Asian-American federal judge when he was appointed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1971. Thurgood Marshall became the first African-American to serve on the Supreme Court in 1967. Sandra Day O'Connor was the first woman to be elevated to the nation's highest court in 1981. ‘I think it's always good to have diverse perspectives, whether it's gender, sexuality or ideology,’ Professor Tobias said.

Crime writer Patricia Cornwell said . that when she became successful, she was unprepared to handle it because . of her mood disorder and so she hired a third party to handle her . financial expenses. That decision turned out to be a . costly one as a federal jury just determined that they swindled her out . of millions of dollars. The jury awarded Ms Cornwell nearly $51million last week after they found that New York-based Anchin, Block & Anchin LLP were at fault for her disappearing fortune and not her rentals of private jets and luxurious apartments at the Trump Tower. 'For the last couple of years before we left this particular company, it seemed that no matter what I did I never had any more money. I kept thinking ""How can I earn this much money and it's not accumulating in any sort of way?"" And I began to be very confused and very concerned,' she said on Wednesday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Telling her side: Intensely private crime writer Patricia Cornwell said that she pursued the lawsuit against her former money manger because she felt that she was sticking up for people who are victimized and aren't able to fight . Despite earning over $10million a year in book sales, Ms Cornwell is reportedly down to her last $13million and has been forced to sell off her helicopter, sports cars and several homes in a bid to reduce her debt. The tipping point came when the FBI began investigating Ms Cornwell for illegal campaign contributions to Hillary Clinton, only to find out that she had no idea about the contributions but that it was her financial planners making those deposits without her approval or permission. 'The next thing I knew I'm being investigated by the FBI as if I was the one who had done all of this,' she said during an appearance on Katie Couric's talk show. 'What happens to the average person if someone does this to you? I had the means to fight it. I have a voice and I have the funds. But what is really so bad about this is you wonder how many people go through something like this and they have no way to fight it. Explaining the process: Katie Couric asked Cornwell about how she first discovered her millions were missing . 'I mean you have to have millions and millions of dollars to pay your legal fees and that's not fair. Justice should not be this expensive. So I thought we will fight this for everybody- it's not just for me, I'm doing it for you. I don't want anybody ever going through this.' This scandal is not the first time that her money has been an issue for her, and her first success came at an emotional and mental cost because of her unspecified mood disorders. 'If you're not really prepared for it it can be overwhelming,' she said. 'Anything that is destabilizing ... makes it harder for you.' During the trial, Cornwell, 56, . testified that Anchin moved her from a conservative management strategy . to an aggressive one without her permission. She said she fired the firm . in 2009 after discovering that her net worth was a little under . $13million, despite having eight-figure earnings in each of the previous . four years. She had . said the firm caused her to miss a book deadline for the first time in . her career when it failed to find her a suitable place to write after . renovation work on her house in Concord went on much longer than . expected. 'This was very . destabilizing. I really lost my ability to focus and concentrate. I did . not know what the book was about anymore,' Cornwell said. Author Patricia Cornwell, with spouse Staci Gruber to her right, leaves federal court in Boston after taking the stand in her lawsuit against her former financial management company . The . lawsuit said the missed deadline caused Cornwell to lose one year's . income: about $15 million in non-recoverable advances and commission. Defense lawyer James Campbell . said Cornwell's money worries were due to her extravagant lifestyle . which included spending  $1,000-per-day on a car service, a $10 million . renovation project at her Massachusetts estate and the $1.2 million . purchase of a Florida condo.

For most grown women, brown opaque tights are a vague memory associated with bad Brownie outfits, but here are three of the country's most photographed women striding confidently around the Gloucestershire countryside as though cladding your legs in cocoa-coloured 60 deniers is the most normal thing in the world. 31-year-old Kate arrived at the course today with husband William wearing a peachy pink Joseph coat teamed with head-to-toe brown accessories. Her hat was a £240 Betty Boop style from milliners Lock & Co, the boots a pair of Stuart Weitzman suede knee-highs. Even her gloves and clutch bag matched. 31-year-old Kate arrived at the course today with husband William wearing a peachy pink coat teamed with head-to-toe brown accessories .

Meanwhile 29-year-old Pippa set out to dazzle her eligible racing date Tom Kingston in a bespoke bright yellow coat by British designer Katherine Hooker.

Uphill struggle: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson will attempt to turn the tide on limited use of GM food in Europe with a high-profile speech . Genetically modified crops should be sold in Europe, despite consumers' concerns about 'Frankenstein foods’, the Environment Secretary Owen Paterson will say. Mr Paterson, who has previously spoken out about the benefits of GM technology, has decided to make a high-profile speech in the hope of turning the tide on the issue. It is understood he has the firm backing of Chancellor George Osborne, who believes GM food could provide opportunities for British farmers. Brussels has so far only approved two GM crops for human consumption, although they are widely used in the US and China, and can be fed to animals in the EU. Supporters say Europe will suffer food shortages and be more reliant on imports if it continues to reject GM products. But the Mail has highlighted concerns over 'Frankenstein foods' for years, amid fears that tampering with the genes in crops could damage natural ecosystems or even affect human health. The Environment Secretary has dismissed these concerns as 'complete nonsense’. He believes Britain should be open to using the GM science to increase crop yields and prevent disease. Last year he called critics of the technology 'humbugs' and said the case for GM  food needed to be made 'emphatically' in Britain. 'Frankenstein foods': Brussels has so far only approved two GM crops for human consumption . But Mr Paterson, who has been criticised for his handling of the horsemeat scandal, faces an uphill struggle convincing the British public of the benefits of GM food. A survey last month by the Food Standards Agency found two out of three UK shoppers wanted products from animals fed a GM diet to be labelled. Mr Paterson will also have to win over countries who are deeply opposed to any form of GM farming or food such as France and Germany. His most viable option is for every nation to be allowed to choose whether to sell GM food in their shops. Campaign: The Mail has highlighted fears 'Frankenstein foods' could damage ecosystems and human health . In 2010, the EU Commission considered giving back control over GM crop approval to member states. Support: Mr Paterson is understood to have the backing of Chancellor George Osborne . But this policy was abandoned last year after widespread opposition, as the food industry is too globalised for it to work. An aide to Mr Paterson  said: 'He wants to have a national conversation about it, based on scientific evidence, and the Prime Minister supports that.' Tory MP George Freeman has been advising Whitehall on the UK’s agri-tech policy. He believes the safety debate is over. He told the Financial Times: 'Over a trillion meals containing GM food have now been eaten in what is effectively  the biggest ever global clinical trial in the history of mankind, without one adverse health report. 'The world is adopting genetic crop science. The question is whether the UK is going to benefit or not?’ The Coalition has so far allowed scientists to carry out small-scale GM cultivation trials, but its use in consumer products is effectively banned. However, British farmers have reportedly written to supermarkets warning them that they will not be able to guarantee chickens are fed on solely non-GM feed by May.","Owen Paterson believes the UK should be open to using the GM science .

The Bolshoi ballet director partially blinded an acid attack has spoken of his determination to return to the stage 'as soon as' he can see again. Sergei Filin appeared at a press conference at the German hospital where doctors are trying to save his eyesight, saying he is ‘full of strength and faith’ that he will work again. The artistic director at the famous Moscow theater was attacked outside his home in January by a masked man who threw sulfuric acid in his face, leaving him with severe damage to his eyes and skin. Attacked: Sergei Filin dries his eyes during the press conference at the university hospital in Aachen, Germany, as he speaks about his determination to return to the Bolshoi when his sight returns . Swathed in a scarf and hat to cover his burns, he sat next to his doctors at Aachen University Clinic as they said they remain hopeful Mr Filin would recover useful . vision. ‘I am full of strength and faith that I will recover what has been unjustly taken from me,’ Mr Filin said. He said he was not afraid of returning to the theater despite reports of murky rivalries at the ballet that might have been behind the attack. Top Bolshoi dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko is accused of masterminding the acid attack, and has admitted to a court that he ordered a physical attack on Mr Filin, but that he never . expected the perpetrator to use acid. Mr Dmitrichenko has been refused bail and will remain in custody until April 18 as the investigation is carried out. Brave: Sergei Filin is helped onto the stage at today's press conference where he hid his face behind a pair of sunglasses and a black scarf and hat . No fear: Sergei Filin said he is not afraid to return as the Bolshoi's artistic director despite one of his top dancers admitting to ordering the attack . Getting there: Sergei Filin, second from left, listens as his doctors at the university hospital in Aachen, Germany, speak of his treatment . An alleged accomplice, Yuri Zarutsky, is accused of accepting 50,000 roubles, around £1,080, from Dmitrichenko to attack Mr Filin. Meanwhile doctors at Aachen University Clinic said one of Mr Filin's badly damaged eyes has already shown . some improvement. Dressed head to toe in black and . wearing large dark glasses, Mr Filin sat . quietly as doctors discussed his treatment, before addressing the audience. He said he was in daily telephone contact with his . deputy at the theater and had no fear about going back to . work. ‘As soon as I can see, I will go back and do the same work. I am . not afraid.’ Confession: Bolshoi soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko, pictured in court last week, has admitted to 'giving his blessing' to a physical attack on Filin but not that the perpetrator would use acid . Then and now: Sergei Filin pictured today at the conference, left, and, right, before the attack . Dr. Martin Hermel, an eye specialist, . said that Mr Filin suffered damage to the surface and inner parts of both . eyes and had undergone several surgeries. He cautioned that Filin faces . ‘complex and long-term treatment’ that could take months rather than . weeks. Dr Hermel said that he held out hope that Filin would ‘recover useable vision’ to allow him to return to his professional duties. While his . left eye had shown some improvement, Dr Hermel said his team 'cannot at this point make a . statement about the prognosis for vision in this eye.' The Bolshoi Theater's general director, Anatoly Iksanov, has accused veteran principal dancer Nikolai Tsiskaridze of inciting tensions in the theater that led to the attack. Tsiskaridze, a long-time fierce critic of Iksanov who is reported to aspire to his job, has rejected the allegation.","Sergei Filin said he is determined to return to the Bolshoi ballet in Moscow .

"By . Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 15:26 EST, 15 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:26 EST, 15 March 2013 . David Cameron and Angela Merkel were at loggerheads tonight after only one country backed Britain and France’s call to arm the Syrian rebels. At a summit in Brussels today, the Prime Minister and French president Francois Hollande urged other European leaders to back their call for the lifting of an EU-wide arms embargo on the war-torn state. But they embarrassingly found themselves in a minority of three - with only Slovenia coming out to support their stance. Head to head: David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel came to verbal blows after Merkel refused to support Britain and France in their call to lift the EU-wide arms embargo on Syria . German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned of the danger that lifting the embargo could lead to arms falling into the hands of dangerous Islamists. And the Austrians threatened to pull their UN troops out of the Golan Heights - land disputed between Israel and Syria - if Britain and France unilaterally lifted their embargo. Mr Cameron and President Hollande warned that if they did not get the support they needed, they would effectively veto the extension of the existing EU ban on supplying weapons to either side of the bloody conflict, which has already claimed more than 70,000 lives. This would enable countries that wished to do so to supply the rebels. Mr Cameron believes it is becoming increasingly important to arm ‘moderate’ rebels to prevent the uprising being taken over by jidahist fighters who are flooding into the country. Arming Syria: David Cameron, pictured at the summit today, said that it was becoming increasingly important to arm the 'moderate' groups of Syrian rebels in order to prevent the uprising being turned into a jihad war . A Downing Street source said there was a ‘perversity’ about the existing arms embargo, which meant that the rebels were receiving no outside help when Russia and Iran are arming Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Moscow has been the main ally of Assad, shielding him from UN sanctions and supplying him with weapons during the two-year conflict. But despite Britain and France’s forthright arguments at the EU council meeting in Brussels yesterday, only one country - Slovenia - came out in support. Chancellor Merkel said she was concerned weapons would end up in the wrong hands. ‘It is an extremely difficult situation,’ she said at a press conference. ‘We have a whole series of reservations regarding weapons exports to the opposition. We have to ask ourselves whether we are not further fuelling the conflict by doing that.’ Action: French President Francois Hollande, pictured with his partner Valerie Trierweiler, has said he wants the weapons embargo lifted with immediate effects . ‘We all are deeply concerned about the . desperate situation in Syria,’ she said. ‘Europe can only play a strong . and effective role if it acts as one. If partners want to revisit . common decisions we should hear them out and decide jointly.’ EU foreign policy chief Baroness Cathy . Ashton said that lifting the arms blockade could be seized on by . supporters of the regime to channel even more arms to bolster Assad’s . military campaign. And Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte warned the UK and France against unilateral action. In . a post-summit press conference yesterday, Mr Cameron said he disagreed . with Chancellor Merkel’s position - saying arms were going to the wrong . people now. He said: ‘That . is what has happened already and actually it’s important for countries . like Britain and France, working with the Americans, working with other . allies, to help the opposition to work with the opposition and shape the . opposition and to make sure that it is those parts of the opposition . that support a democratic, pluralistic Syria where minorities are . properly protected, those are the organisations getting our help and . getting our assistance.’ However, . Mr Cameron’s language was much less bellicose than President Hollande, . who has said he would like to start arming the Syrian rebels now. Violent conflict: Members of the Free Syrian Army inspect the wreckage of a helicopter belonging to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces earlier this month, as the death toll for the two year civil war hit 70,000 . The Prime Minister said: ‘As things stand today I’m not saying that Britain would actually like to supply arms to rebel groups. What we want to do is work with them and try to make sure that they are doing the right thing. ‘Britain is a sovereign country. We have our own foreign, security and defence policies. If we want to take individual action, of course we are free to do so.’ He went on: ‘You can either keep renewing that common position or you can decide not to renew that common position. ‘If we thought our national interest was best met in another way, we would always stand up for British interests. ‘It is worth standing back and asking: why are we debating and discussing the approach we take? The answer is two years in, 70,000 people are dead, there is a huge refugee and humanitarian crisis, Assad is still in place and being strongly supplied and strengthened by others and we need to put pressure on to bring about the transition necessary for Syrian people, necessary for stability in that region and in our national interest.’ Mr Cameron said it would be wrong for Austria to pull out of the Golan Heights, because arming the Syrian rebels was a completely different issue. Speaking at his own press conference, President Hollande said France wanted to arm the rebels. ‘We are fighting terrorism around the world,’ he said. ‘We have been helping the opposition in Syria and want to go further. We trust the opposition - we do not want Syria to become another Libya.’","Britain and France urged EU to lift arms emgaro on Syria at Brussels summit .

Gary Walker, NHS whistleblower and former Hospital chief executive for United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS trust, says bullying is rampant in the NHS . The former boss of a hospital which is being investigated over high death rates today described a culture of 'sheer bullying' in the NHS. Gary Walker, former chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust (ULHT), said he was threatened by East Midlands Strategic Health Authority (SHA) when he flagged up hospital capacity problems. The whistleblower, who claimed he was sacked after raising concerns about patient safety, said he felt pressured by officials when he put the hospital on 'red alert' because it was almost full to capacity. He said: 'The response from the health authority was, ""This is your problem - you need to meet the targets whatever the demand"". 'It is a very dangerous thing to be trying to push through targets when hospitals are dangerously over full.' Mr Walker, who was sacked in 2010 for 'gross professional misconduct' over alleged swearing at a meeting, said he was forced to quit after refusing to meet Whitehall targets for non-emergency patients and was gagged from speaking out as part of a settlement deal. He added that in February 2009 he met Dame Barbara Hakin - who has been named interim chief operating officer of the NHS Commissioning Board - and 'essentially certain threats were made to me like, ""If you don’t deliver the targets then I won’t be able to protect you"". She denies the claims. 'In essence there was a lot of pressure to deliver the targets and this was going to reflect on me as an individual if we didn’t meet those targets. 'At the same time I am asking for a capacity review, for help, and the situation escalated, when the hospital became more and more full more and more threats were made.' He said he prepared a presentation for the Department of Health about problems with hitting targets but was ordered to remove any reference to him calling for a capacity review. He said: 'If you upset the SHA, particularly the one I was working for, there would be repercussions for you. You work in that environment as best you can. Target chasing: Mr Walker flagged up capacity problems but said he was told: 'This is your problem - you need to meet the targets whatever the demand' 'I spoke with other (hospital) chief executives and many of them, but not all, concurred with my view of the health authority that they were only ever interested if you’re going to suggest there is a problem anywhere, and they are very heavy-handed with how that problem is going to be resolved, so threats are made, people are told, ""You realise the consequences if this doesn’t get done?"". 'This isn’t proper management, this is just sheer bullying.' The former chairman of the trust, David Bowles, added that there is a culture in the health service of 'making things look good rather than being good'. Mr Bowles, who also resigned in 2009, said the SHA deliberately hid financial troubles at the trust from senior Department of Health officials. He said: 'For whatever reason, the way the accounting system was running, (some) deficits were effectively doubled for a while because of strange quirks in the accounting system. Hidden: David Bowles, former chairman of the United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, says financial problems in the trust were concealed . 'The Government realised it, decided to put it right, issued a press release saying: ""These are the trusts that are affected, we are going to adjust their accounts by these amounts"". 'ULHT should have been on that schedule and should have received compensation from the Government circa £11 million. We were not on that schedule. 'When I raised it with my director of finance, I was told we were not on that schedule because this trust is not to receive a cash adjustment because the SHA did not wish to identify any trusts in the East Midlands as being financially challenged. 'The very clear implication of that is that the financial distress in ULHT was being deliberately concealed from the centre to make the SHA look good. 'It is a sign of that culture of not owning up to problems, not being transparent. The trust is one of 14 being investigated by health chiefs over high mortality rates in the wake of the public inquiry report into serious failures at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. Mr Bowles told the Health Select Committee: 'If you read the Mid Staffs report it says things like ""bullying, target driven priorities, denial"" and it goes on and says this was not only in Mid Staffordshire - they collected evidence that it existed elsewhere and I can assure you it existed in this part of the health economy. 'There is this deeply ingrained culture of making things look good rather than things actually being good.' He said that the trust was at 'tipping point' but was told once again to 'meet targets regardless of demand'. He added: 'I was in our situation rooms where staff were desperate for the next bed for an emergency patient and I’m being told, ""treat your non urgent patients"". 'I found that absolutely scandalous.' Mr Bowles told MPs that staff were frightened to raise concerns about bullying for fear they might lose their jobs, adding: 'If you look at Gary now, he blew the whistle, he has applied for 50 or 60 jobs and not got even one interview. 'That is the culture you are dealing with here.' NHS boss Sir David Nicholson has refused to step down following the Stafford Hospital scandal . Mr Bowles said the culture of bullying and fear in the NHS can only change if there are changes to the leadership. He said: 'There is too much evidence emerging that this was not just Mid Staffordshire and you have to look at who sets the overarching culture and that is set by Sir David Nicholson and I have to say that it is deeply ingrained. 'I do not think you can change the culture of the NHS without changing its leaders.' Mr Walker asked what under fire NHS boss Sir David has done in the last six years to promote whistle blowing in the health service. Mr Walker also claimed that Dame Barbara Hakin, the former chief executive of the East Midlands Strategic Health Authority, authorised his pay off to protect herself . 'As far as I can see, it is much, much worse now than it has ever been,' he said. Mr Walker also claimed that Dame Barbara Hakin, the former chief executive of the East Midlands SHA who is now the interim deputy chief of NHS Commissioning Board, authorised his pay off to protect herself, a claim she denies. He said: 'If it is the case that Barbara Hakin is responsible for that payment that is a very serious charge, potentially of misconduct, on the basis that you can’t use public money to silence matters of your own misconduct.' He added: 'This use of public money to cover up individual failings is a major problem.' A spokesman for the East Midlands SHA, now part of NHS Midlands and East, said: 'NHS Midlands and East, as the successor body for NHS East Midlands, has today presented evidence to the House of Commons Health Select Committee (HSC) on behalf of NHS East Midlands, which challenges the claim by Gary Walker, the former chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, that he raised patient safety concerns as a whistleblower. 'The material makes it clear that it was NHS East Midlands, the strategic health authority (now part of NHS Midlands and East), which was concerned about patient safety at the trust. 'The evidence presented to the HSC makes it clear that there has never been any finding that Gary Walker had raised genuine concerns that would constitute his designation as a whistleblower. 'Now that the compromise agreement between Mr Walker and his employers, which referred to his employment status and his dismissal, has been set aside the SHA is in a position to put its view of events into the public domain which it has not been able to do before.'","Gary Walker, a former Lincolnshire health chief, says bullying is rife .

A British father plunged to his death in the Alps while desperately searching for his 12-year-old son who had been killed in a fall minutes earlier. Police believe Peter Saunders, who had been hiking with his son Charlie in the snow on Mont Blanc, was on the phone to emergency services asking for help when he lost his footing. The 48-year-old managed to tell rescuers his son had fallen out of sight down a couloir – a deep gully – but communication was cut off before he could give the location. An attempt to speak to him again is understood to have left rescuers able to hear only his footsteps and laboured breathing as he trudged through the snow in a frantic state on Saturday. Peter (left) and Charlie (right)  Saunders were involved in a tragic accident whilst walking in the French Alps . EXCLUSIVE PICTURE: The helicopter rescue of Peter and Charlie Saunders who died whilst . walking in Chamonix on Saturday afternoon. The pictures show one of the . victims being winched with a rescuer aboard the rescue helicopter with . the Glacier des Bossons as a backdrop . The bodies of the father and son were found after a photo taken of them earlier in the day was used to locate them . Earlier this month no fewer than 10 people - including mountaineers and off-piste skiers - died in the Mont Blanc area . Tragedy: They plunged down a mountain at . Chamonix-Mont-Blanc . They kept calling back but went . straight to answerphone – and it is believed that by then he had plunged . into the same gully as Charlie. Interpol were later able to contact Mr . Saunders’s wife Sandra in Buckingham, Buckinghamshire, and, using a . photograph her husband and son had sent her from the mountain earlier in . the day, pinpoint their whereabouts. Their bodies were found at . 7.40am yesterday, more than 16 hours after Mr Saunders’s call, during . the fourth aerial search. Charlie had fallen about 980ft. His father was . discovered about 150ft above him. They were at an altitude of 5,000ft . on the 15,781ft mountain. The area where the tragedy happened has a number of footpaths which weave in and out of the mountainside. Richard Mansfield, a British mountain guide who has worked in the area for 20 years and lives 1km from the Bossons glacier, said trails on the north side of the valley were currently 'covered in snow'. He said: 'The footpaths usually don't get that many people out at this time of year because they are much more difficult to navigate, although yesterday was a beautiful sunny day.' Police said the pair were wearing . normal walking boots on a route rarely dared in winter where crampons . and proper climbing gear are essential. Captain Patrice Ribes of the mountain . police said yesterday in the French ski resort of Chamonix: ‘We think . the man fell while he was on the phone to the police. We think he called . immediately after his son had fallen and that he fell very shortly . after. It all happened very quickly.’ A Foreign Office spokesman said it was . providing consular assistance to the family ‘at this difficult time’. A . statement from the family issued by the Foreign Office last night said: . ‘Peter and Charlie Saunders were involved in a tragic accident whilst . walking in the French Alps. The tragic pair died in the popular skiing destination of Chamonix in the French Alps . ‘They had flown to the French Alps for . a short weekend of adventure in the Chamonix valley. They were to have a . half-day walking followed by a full day skiing. Their bodies were . recovered by the local mountain rescue this morning. ‘Charlie was always full of life, had a . really happy temperament and loved spending time with his father. Peter . was fantastic at making things happen, resourceful, with a positive . approach to life. They will both be sorely missed by friends and family . alike.’ The pair had arrived in the Chamonix . valley on Saturday morning and were booked into the two-star hotel Les . Melezes in the nearby town of Les Houches. According to police the area they had . chosen to hike, called La Jonction, at Les Bossons is a popular summer . route rather than suitable for winter or early spring. There are steep . escarpments and the path is often covered with snow and ice at this time . of the year. Captain Ribes said: ‘It is a . dangerous, deep, snowy hike. It is not a route that is chosen much at . this time of the year, especially without snowshoes. In the winter you . cannot see the path, it is hidden by snow. ‘The accident is being investigated . and it will determine the circumstances of the accident, as well as the . level of preparation of the hiker and his experience. The father and son . should have had proper mountain equipment – crampons and climbing . gear.’ It was just before 3pm on Saturday when the emergency centre in Annecy received the frantic call from Mr Saunders. The father and son are thought to . have reached a high altitude by taking the chair lift from Bossons . village to the approaches of the Bossons Glacier, at 1400m. From . there, they are thought to have set off on the well-known La Jonction . (Junction) hike, which is hugely popular with tourists, especially in . the summer months. La . Jonction is a rocky spur from which hikers can look out towards the . Bossons and Taconnaz glaciers. It was is on the route taken by the . Frenchmen who first ascended Mont Blanc in 1786. The . slopes around Mont Blanc, the highest peak in western Europe, are . notoriously dangerous, with scores of mountaineers, skiers and hikers . dying on them every year. Not . only is the fabled ‘White Mountain’ 15,780 feet high, but the climbs . around it are some of the most technically difficult in the world. Despite this, it is often mistakenly claimed that people can enjoy an easy stroll up the slopes.Hundreds . set off on paths every day without ice axes or crampons, let alone . other basic equipment like extra food supplies and tents. Many of the 20,000-plus people who attempt to reach the summit each year are inexperienced or completely novice climbers. Earlier this month no fewer than 10 people – including mountaineers and off-piste skiers – died in the Mont Blanc area. Francis Bianchi, the sub-prefect of . Bonneville, said: ‘The man spoke in English and said he was in Les . Bossons in the commune of Les Houches and that his son had fallen. He . did not say anything else. ‘The call was immediately transferred . to the mountain police in Chamonix. They repeatedly asked him questions. They could hear him and he was panicked. ‘He did not reply to their questions. And then it cut off. It was dramatic. They kept trying to call him back . but it went straight through to the answerphone.’ Meanwhile police had already alerted . the helicopter rescue, but the area is vast. Three sweeps were carried . out, including with infrared cameras after dark. On Saturday evening Mrs . Saunders was contacted and her help was used to direct a fourth . helicopter search yesterday morning, despite high winds. It was then the . bodies were spotted. Mr Bianchi said: ‘They were found . 50metres apart. They had fallen down the very steep Couloir des . Pyramides over rocks and on to the glacier below.’ Eric Fournier, the mayor of Chamonix, . said it was vital to take full precautions when venturing on to the . mountain. His assistant Jean Louis Verdier, a keen mountaineer, said of . the route taken by Mr Saunders and his son: ‘I have turned back in . springtime before. It is icy. It is not a winter hike.’ On average around 100 people a year . die in similar tragedies in the Mont Blanc area. Last July, three . Britons were among nine mountaineers swept to their deaths by an . avalanche on Mont Maudit in the Mont Blanc range.","Peter and Charlie Saunders died at 'The Junction' in Chamonix Valley .

One man shouted 'Rot in Hell, Holmes!' at movie massacre suspect James Holmes today after a judge delayed the alleged mass shooter's arraignment. Steve Hernandez's daughter Rebecca Wingos was killed during the slaughter in an Aurora, Colorado movie theater last summer during a premiere of the new Batman movie, The Dark Knight Rises. When Judge William Sylvester announced Holmes would not have to enter a plea on his charges of murder and attempted murder until March, the crowd of family and victims became noticeably angry. And when the hearing ended, Hernandez yelled, 'Rot in hell, Holmes!' Scroll down for video . Rage: Steve Hernandez, right, shouted in disbelief as the arraignment of his daughter's alleged killer, James Holmes, was put off for two months . The judge . reconvened the proceeding to talk to Hernandez, who apologized . and promised there would be no more outbursts. The judge was . sympathetic. 'I am terribly sorry for your loss and I can only begin to imagine the emotions that are raging,' Sylvester told him. Sylvester ruled Thursday night that prosecutors had presented sufficient evidence at a preliminary hearing to proceed toward trial on charges that James Holmes killed 12 people and injured 70 others at a suburban Denver movie theater on July 20. Sylvester had asked Holmes if he . objected to the delay and defense attorney Tamara Brady answered for . him, saying he did not. Defense lawyers didn't say why they wanted to . delay entering a plea. One possible reason could be to . seek a mental health evaluation by a doctor of their choosing. Lawyers . for Holmes have said he is mentally ill, raising the possibility of an . insanity defense. If Holmes had entered an insanity plea today, an evaluation would be done by state doctors. Sick: Holmes took pictures of himself dressed as the Joker before allegedly committing mass murder . Prosecutors objected to the delay and said they were ready to move ahead. Sylvester said he understood . their position but wanted to make sure he did not do anything that could . lay the grounds for an appeal. 'We want to avoid at all costs doing anything improper,' the judge said. Following the hearing, District . Attorney George Brauchler, who took office this week, didn't . specifically address the delay but said he wanted to 'protect the . interests of all involved in this case.' If Holmes, 25, is convicted of . first-degree murder, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors have . not said whether they would pursue that sentence. Grief: Victims and family members leave an Aurora courtroom today . Loss: Chantel Blunk, center, walks into court. Blunk's husband Jon was killed during the shooting. The hearing capped an emotional . week in which the public, including victims and their families, got the . first look at evidence gathered against Holmes and heard police officers . describe attempts to save the wounded. During the preliminary hearing, . witnesses testified that Holmes spent weeks amassing an arsenal and . planning the attack at a midnight showing of 'The Dark Knight Rises,' and that he took photos of himself hours before the shooting, including . one that showed him grinning with a handgun. They also detailed an elaborate . booby trap set up at Holmes' apartment designed to explode at the same . time the theater attack occurred several miles away. Prosecution witnesses testified . that Holmes began acquiring weapons in early May, and by July 6 he had . two semi-automatic pistols, a shotgun, a semi-automatic rifle, 6,200 . rounds of ammunition and high-capacity magazines that allow a shooter to . fire more rounds without stopping to reload. Holmes' lawyers called no witnesses during the hearing. Scene: The movie theater where the massacre occurred . Another possibility in the case . is that either side could argue that Holmes is not mentally capable of . assisting in his own defense. If that happens, the judge would order a . mental competency evaluation. Sylvester also can order an evaluation if . he has his own questions about Holmes' competence. In the case of the Tucson, Ariz., . shooting that killed six people and wounded 13, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, Jared Loughner was initially ruled incompetent to . stand trial. However, after a year of treatment, Loughner was ruled . competent, the case proceeded, and he entered guilty pleas. If Holmes ends up pleading not . guilty by reason of insanity, Sylvester would also order a psychiatric . evaluation by doctors at the state hospital. A jury would consider that . evaluation, along with testimony by expert witnesses, any other . court-ordered evaluations and other evidence, in deciding at a trial . whether Holmes is or is not guilty by reason of insanity. If found not guilty by reason of . insanity, Holmes would be committed to the state mental hospital for . treatment. His case would be reviewed every six months. He conceivably . could be released if he ever is deemed no longer insane. ""Insanity is what this case is . going to turn on,"" said Denver criminal defense attorney Dan Recht. ""This is not a whodunit case.""","Shouting occurred at the end of hearing .

A convicted mob hit man who led a Boy Scout troop while still a killer says he’s living for God now and volunteers his time driving a church bus in suburban Midwest town. John Veasey was once a feared killer in the Philadelphia mob who survived getting shot to the head three times, aligned with Sicilian crime boss John Stanfa. Now, Veasey says he attends church and has tried to atone for his dirty deeds. He worships regularly, he says, and even helps out his church by volunteering to drive their church school bus. New leaf: Former Philly mob hit man John Veasey says he's a born-again Christian and even volunteers to drive his church school bus . Ironically, this isn’t the first time Veasey has volunteered his time. Believe it or not, While still murdering for the mob, Veasey was a Boy Scout troop leader. He was asked in an upcoming 60 Minutes interview about his double life. ‘Those kids didn’t know I was a hit man,’ he smirks, ‘and a lot of parents were mad. But their kids had fun when I took them camping.’ Darker days: Veasey was once a feared killer who eventually helped take down Philly's biggest crime boss, John Stanfa . High price: For ratting out his boss, Veasey's former crime family gunned down his brother Billy . Veasey pulled off other hits, but his first—made in broad daylight—would be his most famous and perhaps the most sensationalized in Philadelphia mob history. In the interview, scheduled to air Sunday, he describes how it felt as he sat waiting, prepared to kill two men on a tree-lined sunny street. Like ‘I was going to work,’ Veasey shrugs, ‘and part of my work that day was to kill somebody.’ That somebody ended up being rival mobster Mikey ‘Chang’ Ciancaglini, who died on the sidewalk that day in August 1993. The other man Veasey was hired to kill, rival mob boss Joey Merlino, survived. The . murder and attempted murder became part of a trial that ultimately took . down Veasey’s boss—with Veasey’s testimony against his old boss as a . linchpin in the federal case against the mobster. Veasey’s . decision to turn against Stanfa would cost him. His former associates . attempted to kill him, but he survived three shots to the head. Then, . on the very day Veasey was scheduled to rat out Stanfa, Veasey’s . brother Billy was gunned down on his way to work in what police called . an intimidation tactic performed to keep Veasey off the stand. Betrayed?: Philly mob boss John Stanfa, at center in 1980 photo, was handed 5 consecutive life sentences thanks in large part to Veasey's testimony . Quiet life?: A Philadelphia woman claims Veasey has threatened her and her and her husband, who happens to be the man acquitted of Veasey's brother's murder . Veasey testified, anyway, and Stanfa was eventually handed five consecutive life sentences. After serving 10 years for murders to which he confessed in court, Veasey was placed in the witness protection program and began an unlikely life of repentance. He became something of an enigma in an unnamed Midwestern suburb where he’s made a successful living selling luxury cars. But as the 60 Minutes interview proves, the former mobster hasn’t lost his signature swagger. The report, however, questions Veasey’s self-described new lease on life. Kathy Ciancaglini of Philadelphia, whose husband John was acquitted of Billy Veasey’s murder, claims Veasey has left her and her husband threatening voicemails.","John Veasey says he's seen the light and has no intentions of returning to his Philly mob past .

An emotional Lance Armstrong was close to tears when he spoke about the impact of his drug cheating on his family during the second part of his exclusive interview with Oprah Winfrey last night. Speaking about his 13-year-old son Luke, the oldest of his five children, Armstrong said: ‘I saw my son defending me and saying, “That's not true. What you're saying about my dad is not true,'"" Armstrong recalled. ‘That's when I knew I had to tell him.’ The disgraced cyclist battled to fight back tears as he talked about son Luke . Armstrong told Oprah that he believes he deserves to be given the opportunity to compete again . Critics said Armstrong hadn't been contrite enough in the first half of the interview, but on Friday night he seemed to lose his composure when Winfrey zeroed in on the emotional drama involving his personal life. ‘What did you say?’ Winfrey asked. ‘I said, ""Listen, there's been a lot of questions about your dad. My career. Whether I doped or did not dope. I've always denied that and I've always been ruthless and defiant about that. You guys have seen that. That's probably why you trusted me on it."" Which makes it even sicker,’ Armstrong said. ‘And uh, I told Luke, I said,’ and here Armstrong paused for a long time to collect himself, ‘I said, ""Don't defend me anymore. Don't.'"" 'If anyone says anything to you, do not defend me. Just say my dad said he was sorry'. 'He said ""look, I love you, you're my dad, this won't change that"". 'Thank God he's more like Kristin (Armstrong's first wife and Luke's mother).' Armstrong also confirmed he has been undergoing therapy to deal with his demons. Armstrong seemed to lose his composure when Winfrey zeroed in on the emotional drama involving his personal life . Four of Lance Armstrong's children stand next to his team bus in 2010, his two twin daughters Isabelle and Grace, Luke (blue T-shirt) and Max (black T-shirt) Winfrey also drew Armstrong out on . his ex-wife, Kristin, whom he claimed knew just enough about both the . doping and lying to ask him to stop. He credited her with making him . promise that his comeback in 2009 would be drug-free. 'She said to me, ""You can do it under one condition: That you never cross that line again,'"" Armstrong recalled. 'The line of drugs?' Winfrey asked. 'Yes. And I said, ""You've got a deal,'"" he replied. 'And I never would have betrayed that with her.' Armstrong also told Oprah that he . believes he should be given the opportunity to compete again, saying: 'I . deserve to be punished. I'm not sure that I deserve a death penalty.' Armstrong was competing in triathlons, mountain bike events and marathons before he was sanctioned and believes he deserves that opportunity in the future, suggesting a life ban is not right. He told Oprah Winfrey in the second part of their television interview: 'I can't lie to you. I'd love the opportunity to be able to compete, but that isn't the reason that I'm doing this. 'Frankly, this might not be the most popular answer, but I think I deserve it (to be able to compete again).' Armstrong said his lowest moment was having to cut ties with his charity which he described as like a 'sixth child' to him . Lance Armstrong, pictured in 2005 with three of his children, was most emotional when he talked about the impact of his actions on them . Armstrong's infamous tweet photo, he admitted that he thought it had been a good idea at the time . In hindsight Armstrong says he wishes he had . co-operated with the United States Anti-Doping Agency investigation . which proved his downfall. Co-operation could have meant a lesser . penalty. Armstrong's . long-time sponsors including Nike and Anheuser Busch deserted him in quick succession following the . publication of the USADA report, something he described as a '$75-million dollar day.' The Oprah Winfrey Network insisted Armstrong did not receive a fee for the interview and was not offered one. Yet money is a concern after his sponsors departed. His admission has exposed him to numerous lawsuits, too. 'I've lost all future income,' he said. 'I don't like thinking about it, but that was a $75 million day. Gone. And probably never coming back.' However he said his most challenging moment was . when his own Lance Armstrong Foundation, the charity known now as . Livestrong, distanced itself from him. 'The . foundation is like my sixth child and to make that decision, and to . step aside, was big,' said Armstrong, who expressed his wish the charity . can thrive without being associated with him. 'I wouldn't at all say [I was] forced out, told to leave. I was aware of the pressure. 'It was the best thing for our organization, but it hurt like hell. That was the lowest [moment].' Asked if he feels disgraced, Armstrong said: ""Of course, but I also feel humbled. I feel ashamed. This is ugly stuff.' Armstrong admitted he felt disgraced, humbled and ashamed by his actions . Armstrong ended the interview by admitting he had betrayed the people who 'supported me and believed in me' Winfrey . also quizzed him about the photo he tweeted last November in . which he was surrounded by his seven tainted Tour de France winning yellow jerseys. The . infamous photo was tweeted by Armstrong, along with the message: . 'Back in Austin and just layin' around...' not long after he was . stripped off his seven titles by U.S. Anti-doping Agency (USADA) for . using performance-enhancing drugs. ‘Was it just you being your cocky arrogant self?’ asked Oprah. Armstrong admitted that it had been  an act of defiance. 'And you know what's scary I actually thought it was a good idea at the time.' Armstrong also denied claims he attempted to make a payment to USADA. He said: 'I had no knowledge of that, but I've asked around. I think the . claim was 250,000 dollars. That's a lot of money. I would know. That is . not true.' Armstrong says he returned to cycling in 2009 and 2010 having agreed not . to use performance-enhancing drugs again, yet evidence in the USADA . report points to the contrary. He maintains the last time he doped was . during his 2005 Tour de France win. Winfrey asked Armstrong 'Did anyone know the whole truth?' He replied 'Yeah,' but there was no follow-up to ascertain who. So was there a moral to his story? 'I . can look at what I did,' he said. 'Cheating to win bike races, lying . about it, bullying people. Of course, you're not supposed to do those . things. That's what we teach our children.' Armstrong paused to compose himself before a final mea culpa. 'I . just think it was about the ride and losing myself, getting caught up . in that, and doing all those things along the way that enabled that,' he . said. 'The ultimate crime is, uh, is the betrayal of those people that . supported me and believed in me. 'They got lied to.' Thursday night's interview had been the first time that Armstrong had publicly confessed to doping. Sheryl knew: The singer was previously silent over former fiance's doping scandal . One question that wasn't answered is how much  former fiancée Sheryl Crow knew about Armstrong's use of performance-enhancing drugs? Crow, 50, started dating Armstrong in 2003, before getting engaged in 2005 and splitting the following year. The American singer was with Armstrong, 41, during the time that he won two of his Tour de France victories. In September last year Crow told Katie . Couric how she found it difficult watching her former fiance stripped . of his titles. She said: 'I felt bad. I felt bad for him, I felt bad for his family and I . kinda felt like the rest of America... He is a hero that we . watched and looked up to and admired.' Crow is yet to pass comment on Lance's admissions on national television. The New York Daily News reported that . she was interviewed by federal agents in late 2011, before he was . stripped of his titles for using and distributing performance-enhancing . drugs the following year. Meanwhile the Wall Street Journal spoke to two separate sources who claimed Crow knew a lot about the doping scandal.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:06 EST, 12 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:12 EST, 12 March 2013 . It wasn't too long ago that America had a love affair with soda. Now, an old flame has the country's heart. As New York City grapples with the legality of a ban on the sale of large cups of soda and other sugary drinks at some businesses, one thing is clear: soda's run as the nation's beverage of choice has fizzled. In its place? A favorite for much of history: Plain old H2O. New favorite: Over the years, as soda increasingly came under fire for fueling the nation's rising obesity rates, water quietly rose to knock it off the top spot as Americans' favorite drink . For more than two decades, soda was the No. 1 drink in the U.S. with per capita consumption peaking in 1998 at 54 gallons a year, according industry tracker Beverage Digest. Americans drank just 42 gallons a year of water at the time. But over the years, as soda increasingly came under fire for fueling the nation's rising obesity rates, water quietly rose to knock it off the top spot. Americans now drink an average of 44 gallons of soda a year, a 17 percent drop from the peak in 1998. Over the same time, the average amount of water people drink has increased 38 percent to about 58 gallons a year. Bottled water has led that growth, with consumption nearly doubling to 21 gallons a year. Stephen Ngo, a civil defense attorney, quit drinking soda a year ago when he started running triathlons, and wanted a healthier way to quench his thirst. Ngo, 34, has a Brita filter for tap water and also keeps his pantry stocked with cases of bottled water. 'It might just be the placebo effect or marketing, but it tastes crisper,' said Ngo, who lives in Miami. The trend reflects Americans' ever-changing tastes; it wasn't too far back in history that tap water was the top drink. But . in the 1980s, carbonated soft drinks overtook tap as the most popular . drink, with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo putting their marketing muscle behind . their colas with celebrity endorsements from the likes of pop star . Michael Jackson and comedian Bill Cosby. Americans kept drinking more of the . carbonated, sugary drink for about a decade. Then, soda's magic started . to fade: Everyone from doctors to health advocates to government . officials were blaming soft drinks for making people fat. Consumption . started declining after hitting a high in the late 1990s. Sugar high: For more than two decades, soda was the No. 1 drink in the U.S. with per capita consumption peaking in 1998 at 54 gallons a year . At the same time, people started turning to bottled water as an alternative. Its popularity was helped by the emergence of single-serve bottles that were easy to carry around. Until then, bottled water had mainly been sold in 'big jugs and coolers' for people who didn't trust their water supply, said John Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest. The new soft drink-like packaging helped fast-track bottled water's growth past milk and beer. In fact, the amount of bottled water Americans drink has risen nearly every year for more than two decades, while the estimates of how much tap water people drink has fluctuated up and down during that time. When taken together, water finally overtook soda in 2008, according to Beverage Digest. (It's difficult to track how much tap water people drink and how much is used for other things like washing dishes, so experts estimate consumption.) Analysts expect water to hold onto to its top spot for years to come. But whether people will drink from the tap or a bottle is uncertain. Based on current trajectories, Michael Bellas, the CEO of the industry tracker Beverage Marketing Corp., predicts that bottled water alone could overtake soda within the next decade. That's not counting enhanced and flavored waters, which are growing quickly but remain a small part of the bottled water industry. Currently, people drink 21 gallons of . bottled water a year. That compares with 37 gallons of other water, . which includes tap, sparkling, flavored and enhanced waters such as . Coca-Cola's vitaminwater. But there are numerous factors that could tilt the scales in favor of tap water. Based on current trajectories, Michael Bellas, the CEO of the industry tracker Beverage Marketing Corp., predicts that bottled water alone could overtake soda within the next decade . Because of concerns that plastic bottles create too much waste, experts say bottled water could be hit by a public backlash similar to the one that has whipsawed the soda industry with pushes for bans and taxes. New York City was preparing for a ban on cups of sugary drinks that are larger than 16 ounces starting on Tuesday. But on Monday — a day before the ban was to begin — a judge invalidated the regulation. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who originally proposed the ban, vowed to appeal the judge's ruling. Bottled water already is starting to face similar opposition. The town of Concord, Mass. earlier this year banned the sale of water bottles that are less than a liter. And the University of Vermont became the first public university to ban the sale of bottled water. Meanwhile, other cities are waging campaigns to promote tap water. New York City, which touts the high quality of its tap water, offers portable fountains at events around the city. 'Good old marketing has convinced people that they should spend a lot of money on bottled water,' says Salome Freud, chief of New York City's distribution water quality operations. Although companies such as Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. would rather have people buy bottled waters, they're even more invested in getting people to drink more soda again. That's because soda and other drinks that the companies make, such as sports drinks and juices, are more profitable than bottled water. With bottled water, people tend to buy whatever is cheapest. That's a habit that forces companies to keep prices relatively low, which eats into profits. It's why companies are investing so heavily in developing nations such as China and India, where the appetite for soda continues to grow. In the U.S., annual soda sales are more than five times as big as bottled water at $75.7 billion a year, according to Beverage Digest. In terms of volume, soda is only twice as big as bottled water. At Coca-Cola, the No. 1 soda maker, three-quarters of its volume in gallons comes from soft drinks, compared with 8 percent for its bottled waters including Dasani. PepsiCo, the No. 2 soda maker, gets 64 percent of its volume from soft drinks and only 7 percent from its Aquafina bottled water. It's why Coca-Cola, which holds 13 percent of the bottled water market compared with PepsiCo's 10 percent, doesn't seem to think bottled water will ever overtake soda. In an emailed statement, the Atlanta-based company noted that soft drinks remain a far larger category than bottled water and that it sees 'upside' for sodas over the next several years. However, the company added that it saw 'great potential' for bottled water. Like its competitors, Coca-Cola said it's focusing on growing its portfolio of bottled waters profitably by offering brands such as Smartwater and its flavored vitaminwater, which fetch higher prices. In the meantime, the chairman and former CEO of Nestle Waters North America, Kim Jeffery, is waiting for bottled water's moment in the spotlight. Nestle, the Swiss company that makes Poland Spring, Nestle Pure Life, Deer Park and other brands, has nearly half of the share of the bottled water market. At a beverage industry conference late last year, Jeffery noted that bottled water is 'the elephant in the room.' And given the growing warnings over drinking too many calories — including from juice, milk and other sugary drinks — Jeffery said he's confident that water will continue to grow in popularity. 'For thousands of years, water was beverage of choice for human beings,' he said. 'Now we're reverting back to that.'","Americans now drink an average of 44 .

New fears have emerged over 'death-trap' Beko appliances after a fire caused by a faulty tumble dryer destroyed a family's home. The devastating blaze left Lorraine and Brent Ward and their two children homeless and they were forced to live in a single hotel room for four weeks. The couple bought the tumble dryer to cope with extra laundry after their second daughter Lacey was born in November last year, a sister to seven-year-old Molly. Faulty: Lorraine and Brent Ward, with daughter Lacey, lost everything when their tumble dryer burst into flames . Devastating: The damage left by the flames at the Ward's rented bungalow in Tamworth, Staffordshire . Overheated: Beko had issued a product recall but the couple had not idea about potentially lethal problem . But the appliance overheated and burst into flames at their rented home, a two-bedroom bungalow, in Tamworth, Staffordshire, on January 13. 'Brent was screaming to get the kids out because the house was on fire,' said Mrs Ward, 34. 'It was just terrible. We got out, but lost everything we owned. 'Our insurance had run out while I was in hospital, but with so much going on I didn't remember to sort it out. Product recall: Turkish company Beko makes a fifth of all white goods sold in Britain . 'We lived in a hotel for four weeks, which was not easy with us all being in one room. Molly was going to school shattered because the baby kept waking for her feeds. 'We have found a new home but we are having to start from scratch.' The couple received some help, including new toys for the children, but Mrs Ward said: 'A lot of the things we lost can't be replaced such as keepsakes, cards and photos.' She added: 'It was the first time I have ever seen my husband cry – it was total devastation. 'I'm not sure how I have managed to hold it together.' Beko, a Turkish brand that makes a fifth of all new white goods sold in Britain, knew about the tumble dryer fault and issued a product recall in November last year, but the couple had no idea about the potentially lethal problem. The firm accepted responsibility for the fire but it is accused of putting thousands of consumers at risk by supplying products which may be faulty. There are also concerns that it has been too slow to issue safety warnings and ensure that customers who own unsafe products are offered repairs. The firm is at the centre of a £1.5million legal action by Jennifer Benjamin, whose husband died in a fire at their home in Wealdstone, North London. Beko has accepted responsibility for . the fire.

A county council has been accused of 'wasting' £250,000 of taxpayers' money restoring a World War One gunboat while cutting public services at the same time. Conservative-run Hampshire County Council has approved the money for a major revamp of the boat - officially known as HMS M33 - in this year's budget. But it has provoked controversy after the council made £100m savings over the last two years and axed 1,700 jobs. Controversial: Hampshire County Council has approved money for revamp of HMS M33, pictured, despite making £100m savings over the last two years and axed 1,700 jobs . The cuts included closing two libraries which are now run by volunteers. Hampshire council acquired the veteran Monitor gunboat in 1990 when disgraced former Tory leader Freddie Emery-Wallis was in charge. It is one of only two British First World War ships still surviving and is now berthed in dry dock at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, near Nelson's flagship HMS Victory. Culture Secretary Maria Miller praised the project on a recent visit. But Councillor Peter Chegwyn, Liberal Democrat opposition spokesman for recreation and heritage, said 'I am surprised that the council, which is cutting libraries, museums and galleries, can yet find such a large amount to spend on a ship which is certainly of historical interest but surely there are more worthwhile projects. 'I would much rather see the money spent . on restoring the book fund and keeping open small libraries and . galleries which are under threat of closure.' Not happy: Councillor Peter Chegwyn, pictured, said he is surprised that the council is funding the restoration project . The council has refused to say how much it has already spent restoring the former rusting hulk to her original external 1915-1919 condition. Built in 1915, HMS M33 saw active service in the Mediterranean throughout the First World War and provided support for the landing of Allied forces during the Gallipoli campaign of 1915-16. After the war, she served a variety of purposes, including fuelling hulk, floating workshop and office. In 1997, the county museum service placed her in dry docks for extensive works to stabilise hull corrosion. Other repairs have included new masts, internal structural works and making her hull watertight. Nearly all the fittings, anchors and gun shields were made from scratch. The latest refit is a joint project with the National Museum of the Royal Navy to mark the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign in 1915. It will mean visitors can step on board the historic vessel and see inside - currently the gunboat can only be viewed from the dockside. Culture and recreation chief Councillor Keith Chapman defended the expenditure. He said 'The county council saved and restored the M33 warship, which is one of only two surviving First World War ships, and it will now become an even more popular public attraction as the nation remembers the 1914-18 war when it celebrates the centenary of that war.' Councillor Chapman said the county council was in discussion with National Museum of the Royal Navy to secure funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund for future works. The ship refit comes after the council closed Stanmore Library in Waverley Way in 2012 to save £36,000 per year. The library moved to The Carroll Centre where it is now run by volunteers. North Baddesley Library was also shut last year but reopened the following day as a community library run by the parish council and Friends of North Baddesley Library.

Determined: Hilary Devey says she cannot find enough women to work in senior positions, because they put their families first . One of Britain’s leading female business executives says she cannot find enough women to work in senior positions, because they put their families first. Dragons’ Den panellist Hilary Devey said many of the women she encounters in the workplace are better than their male counterparts – but they will not commit to serving at the highest levels. The 56-year-old haulage tycoon, whose third marriage ended in divorce last month, said: ‘The glass ceiling does not exist. You find a good woman in business and she’ll often be better than a man – the problem is finding them.’ She continued: ‘I can’t get any women on my board because women generally put their partner and children first.’ Miss Devey launched her freight distribution company Pall-Ex in 1996 to fund her son Mevlit’s education. She . made her first million within three years and is now worth an estimated . £50million. The entrepreneur has previously said the ‘myth’ of a glass . ceiling is a poor excuse for women not rising to the top. ‘There are lots of myths about why women are under-represented in the boardroom, but the excuse about a “glass ceiling” is the worst. I am living proof there’s no such thing,’ she said last August. ‘The sooner we stop complaining about our biological differences and get down to work, the sooner more women will rise to the top.’ The Bolton-born daughter of a pub landlord yesterday said her earliest memory was the bailiffs ‘taking every stick of furniture’ when her father was declared bankrupt. ‘It felt like an injustice,’ she said, adding: ‘I’m in business to make money.

"By . Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 19:30 EST, 17 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:00 EST, 18 March 2013 . A veteran Tory MP has become the first to offer to vacate his seat for Boris Johnson - opening the way for a leadership battle with David Cameron. The move by Sir Peter Tapsell comes as UKIP soars again in the polls - reaching 17 per cent, ahead of the Lib Dems, while the Conservatives trail nine points behind Labour. According to Tory MPs, Sir Peter, MP for Louth and Horncastle in Lincolnshire, was asked by the Prime Minister if he would stay on in the Commons until the next election. Growing support: Ambitious Mayor of London Boris Johnson, left, is gathering greater popularity as MPs such as Sir Peter Tapsell, right, look to alternative leaders for the Conservative Party . Mr Cameron is said to have told him that the party could do without another by-election. The 83-year-old MP replied that he was ‘keeping his seat warm for Boris’. The offer is the clearest of its kind made by a Conservative MP so far. The MP denied he was part of a Boris ‘camp’ yesterday, but the story will add to the Prime Minister’s concerns that more and more Tory backbenchers believe the London mayor would be a better Conservative leader than him. Mr Johnson would only be able to stand in a Tory leadership contest if he returned to the Commons - meaning an MP would have to offer to give up their seat to him. Another complication is that he has pledged to stay on as mayor until 2016. Blond ambition: Sir Peter Tapsell said that Boris Johnson would make an excellent leader of the Conservative Party . Sir Peter, who as ‘Father of the House’ is the longest-serving MP, told the Sunday Telegraph he thought Mr Johnson would be an ‘excellent’ leader of the Opposition and ‘perhaps’ even a good prime minister. But he added that his seat could be too far from London to be suitable for Mr Johnson. ‘The problem is my seat is a long way from the TV studios,’ said Sir Peter, who has a majority of nearly 14,000. ‘Boris would want to be closer to them.’ The offer comes as a ComRes poll showed that UKIP has surged to 17 per cent in the polls, taking support from the Tories. Lurking danger: The UK Independence Party, led by Nigel Farage is proving an electoral threat for Conservatives . The Conservatives polled just 28 per cent, behind Labour on 37 per cent but ahead of the Lib Dems on just 9 per cent. A separate poll by ICM found that UKIP’s policies are favoured over the Tories’ among key right-of-centre voters - particularly on immigration, government spending and same-sex marriage. Among those who say they have yet to decide which of the two parties to vote for - around one in ten of all voters - more favour UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Mr Johnson over the Prime Minister. In the running: Britain's first black Conservative MP Adam Afriyie has also been hotly tipped as a future party leader . Nadine Dorries, the MP for Mid-Bedfordshire who had the Tory whip suspended last year for appearing on a reality TV show, said the Tories needed a ‘change of direction’ in order to stop the flight to UKIP. ‘It seems UKIP’s march in the polls is hardening,’ she told Sky News. ‘I think there is a very stark lesson for Conservatives to be taken from this and of course it all follows on from the Eastleigh by-election.’ Yesterday Tory backbencher Adam Afriyie, who has been accused of plotting a leadership bid despite only having been elected in 2005, declined to state that he believes Mr Cameron will still be leader by the election. Asked repeatedly on the BBC’s Sunday Politics show, he said: ‘I’m not prepared to speculate, because I think what people want to see from their politicians is they want to see leadership and a commitment to getting Britain back on top.’ Asked about his leadership ambitions, Mr Afriyie said: ‘I’m not ambitious for any position in government or any position at all in the party. What I’m ambitious for is for the British people to get jobs, and you know, to feel proud of their country again.’","Longest serving MP Peter Tapsell said Boris would be 'an excellent leader'

Two men - accused of stealing a motorised rickshaw - were badly beaten by vigilantes, stripped half-naked and hung by their feet in a crowded bus station in the Nile Delta. A baying crowd of 3,000 people watched, with some shouting 'kill them'. Both men died. Scroll down for video . Horrific: These two men - accused of stealing a motorised rickshaw - were badly beaten by vigilantes, stripped half-naked and hung by their feet in a crowded bus station in Egypt . The lynchings came a week after the attorney general's office encouraged civilians to arrest lawbreakers and hand them over to police. It was one of the most extreme cases of vigilantism in two years of sharp deterioration in security following Egypt's 2011 uprising. The worsening security coupled with a police strike prompted the attorney general's call for citizen arrests last week. The scene was emblematic of the chaos that is sweeping the country, mired in protests over a range of social, economic and political problems and with security breaking down to frightening proportions. The state-run newspaper Ahram reported on its website that the two men were dragged in the street after being caught 'red-handed' trying to steal a rickshaw. It said they were beaten but alive before they were hung. Witnesses claimed the men had kidnapped a girl inside the rickshaw, but that she escaped unharmed. A photographer who witnessed the scene told The Associated Press that some in the crowd of around 3,000 threatened to kill him if he took pictures of the lynching. He said that women and children in the crowd watched the men being hung by their feet, and that some even chanted in support of the lynching. Brutal: It was one of the most extreme cases of vigilantism in two years of sharp deterioration in security following Egypt's 2011 uprising . Residents also threatened to lynch another two men accused of being involved in the rickshaw theft. Photographs . from the scene show the two men hanging upside down from a rafter in . their underwear at an open-air bus station in the town of Samanod, about . 55 miles (90 kilometers) north of Cairo. They appear badly beaten. Some initial reports said they were hung from a tree but photos from the scene showed it was a rafter. Other . photographs show the men then lying on the ground dead in their . underwear, with ropes around their feet. Their bodies are covered in . dirt, bruises, blood and lacerations as a group of angry looking men . gathered around them. One man in the crowd grasped a knife in one fist . and another held up a bloodied wooden stick. The witness said the crowd then took the bodies to a nearby police station and dumped them at the front door. Ahram . reported that police could not reach the site of the hangings because . residents had cut off the roads to protest a shortage of diesel fuel, . one of Egypt's many crises. Earlier in the day, residents of the nearby . city of Mahalla had cut off a main train track to protest the fuel . shortages. 'The lack of . security has created a sense of terror here,' the witness said, speaking . on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. 'The entire area is . shut down because of protests against the fuel shortages.' Security . officials said those who tried to help free the two men were pushed . back by others in a crowd in the small town, which is in the Nile Delta . province of Gharabiya. They . said they are preparing for possible blood feuds between residents of . Samanod and the nearby village of Mahallahit Ziyad, where the two men . were from. The bodies . were taken to the morgue for identification, according to security . officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not . authorised to speak to the media. Similar attacks have happened elsewhere in Egypt, though vigilante killings are not frequent. In 2012 in northern Sharqiya province, . police said relatives of a man who was killed when muggers tried to . steal his car lynched one of the thieves. Worrying: A huge crowd gathered to watch the lynching . They then burned his body while it . hung on a light pole. Another vigilante incident that year was in the . Nile Delta province of Mansoura, where relatives of a victim took . justice into their own hands and lynched two suspected killers. Citizens . have grown bolder in taking matters into their own hands following the . 2011 uprising that ousted longtime authoritarian ruler Hosni Mubarak. The country's once powerful and feared police force was left weakened . after the revolt. Egypt is embroiled in another wave of political unrest that has also engulfed the nation's police force. Thousands . of officers and low-ranking policemen have broken ranks, staging . protests and waging strikes against what they say is the politicization . of the force by President Mohammed Morsi and his interior minister. Some . of the striking police officers allege that the Brotherhood group is . attempting to control them. The Brotherhood denies that. Opponents . of the attorney general's call for citizen arrests fear that it is a . prelude to the substitution of police by militias belonging to Morsi's . powerful Muslim Brotherhood group and other allied Islamist groups. On Sunday, Interior Minister Mohammed . Ibrahim, who oversees the country's police, met with officers and . low-ranking policemen to hear their demands. A . statement from the ministry said Ibrahim thanked the police for their . efforts. Two days earlier, Morsi attended traditional Islamic prayers at . a Cairo-based camp for riot police where he praised the force despite . public criticism over their violent response to anti-government . demonstrations. Also on . Sunday, dozens of journalists protested outside their syndicate in Cairo . against what they claim were assaults on their colleagues by members of . the Brotherhood. Diaa . Rashwan, the newly elected head of the syndicate who replaced a figure . considered by most journalists as pro-Brotherhood, condemned the alleged . assault Saturday evening outside the Brotherhood's headquarters where . journalists were covering a meeting. The . journalists say that after activists sprayed anti-Brotherhood graffiti . on the ground outside the headquarters, the Brotherhood guards attacked . with sticks and chains. The Brotherhood said in a statement that . guards outside the building were provoked and insulted by the activists . and journalists. Many of the group's offices were attacked across the . country in December during violent protests over the drafting of the . constitution. Police fired tear gas and a police vehicle was torched during Saturday night's clashes. Al-Dustor opposition party, led by Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei, blamed the Brotherhood's leadership for allegedly encouraging 'militias' loyal to the group to join the fight. In other developments, the Supreme Administrative Court said a body of judges is reviewing an appeal against suspending parliamentary elections. The voting was slated to begin in April and be held in several stages through June. Morsi's Islamist supporters and some in the public exhausted by the turmoil hope the elections will be a step toward bringing some stability, accusing the opposition of stirring up unrest to derail the voting. But the mainly liberal and secular opposition has called for a boycott of the vote, saying Morsi must first find some political consensus first to ease the wave of popular anger.","Men stripped half-naked and hung by their feet in a crowded bus station .

'France is sad and I think the French are fed up,' the star declared. He said the problem is 'especially the lack of energy'. The Government, he added, 'doesn’t know how to do its job' as President Francois Hollande has 'never held a ministerial post'. Withering attack: Gerard Depardieu said 'France is sad' and the French are fed up under President Hollande . The 63-year-old actor's broadside came during a TV interview in Belgium, where he resides. Many of France’s wealthiest figures have decamped across the border to avoid the threat of a 75 per cent tax rate. But Depardieu, who last year accepted Russian citizenship from Vladimir Putin, said it was 'not quite true' he moved to Belgium for tax reasons. Referring to the central in-the-sticks region, where President Hollande made his early political career, the film star told Notele: 'He just had the Correze, which is in deficit.' Exile: The 63-year-old is welcomed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Black Sea resort, Sochi . Depardieu sparked bemused annoyance from the French and anger from politicians when he accepted President Putin's offer late last year in a move that was widely perceived to be a refusal to pay taxes. Sporting a two-headed eagle brooch -- a symbol of Russia -- and framed by a large ham drying in the background, a relaxed Depardieu spoke from the Belgian village of Nechin, near the French border, where he has set up home. 'It was not quite true,' he said of the claim he left France over a tax row, adding that he already paid '50 percent' tax in Belgium. He was not in Belgium 'to make money', he said. Not only is Nechin only 125 miles from Paris’s Charles de Gaulle airport, he explained, but having friends in the village and the high quality of the local meat were also factors that tempted him away from France, he said. Coffers: The actor claims to have paid 145 million euros in taxes in 45 years of working in France . But he nonetheless judged Hollande’s fiscal policy to be 'a bit over the top'. French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti, both of whom were highly critical of Depardieu’s flight abroad, also received a verbal swipe from the actor. 'You can’t criticise someone who pays 87 percent tax,' said the star of Cyrano de Bergerac and Green Card. Depardieu has said that he paid 85 percent tax on his revenues in 2012 and that over 45 years of working and running businesses in France he had paid 145 million euros to state coffers. In the interview he also revealed his plans to buy a restaurant near Nechin and, on the film side of things, said he had projects in both the United States and, of course, Russia.","Film star denied that he moved to Belgium to avoid 75 per cent tax .

CNN's coverage of the Steubenville rape story has been roundly criticized after the cable news network focused on the devastating effect on the 'promising' lives of the rapists and not the 16-year-old victim. As the breaking news of the guilty verdict against Steubenville High School football players Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, was relayed from the Ohio court-room on Sunday, anchor Candy Crowley turned to correspondent Poppy Harlow, who seemed more affected by the tearful reactions of the two teens. Harlow described the scene in the court as, 'Incredibly difficult, even for me, to watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures, star football players, very good students, literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart.' Scroll Down for Video . Candy Crowley broke the news to CNN viewers that Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, had been found guilty of rape on Sunday in Steubenville, Ohi . 'One of the young men, Ma'lik Richmond, as that sentence came down, he collapsed,' added Harlow, saying that the rapist turned to his attorney and said, 'my life is over, no one is going to want me now.' During the segment, CNN aired court-room video of Richmond in floods of tears over the verdict while he hugged his lawyer. 'I was sitting about three feet from Ma’lik when he gave that statement,' said Harlow. 'It was very difficult to watch.' Social media immediately lit up with incredulous reaction to the tone of CNN's coverage about two young men who raped a severely intoxicated 16-year-old fellow student and who then swapped pictures and stories of the teen online in the days afterwards. Viewers of the cable news network expressed their dismay over the tone of coverage as Crowley handed over to reporter Poppy Harlow in Ohio . Journalist Hadley Freeman of the Guardian was stunned, tweeting, 'Honestly, save for openly blaming the victim, it's hard to imagine how CNN could have covered the Steubenville verdict more ineptly.' Members of the public were shocked too, with college student Jon Wainwright taking to Twitter to post, 'Crack job reporting the Steubenville rape @CNN. We should always worry about how a conviction will ruin the lives of rapists, not the raped.' Outrage at the beleagured news networks coverage peaked when Crowley asked the resident CNN legal contributor Paul Callan for his opinion on the verdict for, 'a 16 year old, sobbing in court, regardless of what big football players they are, they still sound like 16 year olds.' 'There’s always that moment of just — lives are destroyed,' Callan remarked. 'But in terms of what happens now, the most severe thing with these young men is being labeled as registered sex offenders. That label is now placed on them by Ohio law.' 'That will haunt them for the rest of their lives.' 'Employers, when looking up their background, will see that they're registered sex offenders. When they move into a new neighborhood and somebody goes on the Internet, where these things are posted, neighbors will know that they are registered sex offenders.' Twitter users were forthright in their opinions regarding the coverage CNN gave to the guilty verdict in the Steubenville, Ohio rape trial . Guardian journalist Hadley Freeman was appalled with how CNN lamented lamented that the 'promising' lives of the teenage rapists had been ruined . Other members of the public took the view that CNN had got their news angle for the trial wrong . Jamil Smith, a digital producer for MSNBC's Melissa Harris-Perry show was scathing about what he saw as terrible reporting, 'I hope CNN is embarrassed by the way in which they covered the #Steubenville verdict. No guarantees, though,' Indeed, as both Steubenville High School students faced the reality of the consequences of what happened that August night last year, their remorse appeared overwhelming. Both have been sentence to a minimum of one year in a juvenile detention institution with the maximum stay of until they are 21.

Mays faced an additional charge of the use and dissemination of nude images of a minor. He received the same sentence for that to run consecutively. His minimum detention is two years. His actions were, according to presiding Judge Lipps, ‘more egregious’ making it inappropriate that he should face the same sentence as Richmond. Richmond’s father, Nathaniel, who has been present in court every day made his way over to his son, fell to his knees and told him that he loved him. ‘My life is ruined,’ Richmond told attorney his Walter Madison, who was clearly shocked at the verdict. Mays father, Bryan, held his head in his hands as the defendant’s sister Rhiannan and mother wept. Both defendants took the opportunity to address the victim and her family – present for the verdict and visible to the defendants but out of view of the main court in a screened off section of seating.

Mays was composed as he said: ‘I would like to apologize to [the victim] and her family, my family and the community. No pictures should have been sent let alone ever taken.’ But though Mays apologized quite specifically for taking pictures of the victim and sending them nowhere did he mention or offer an apology for the rape. In every communication with the victim following the night of 11 -12 August he repeatedly denied raping her. In fact in an incriminating detail it is an allegation he denies before it is ever made. Again and again his texts show him turning the blame on the victim, hectoring her, pressurizing her not to go to the police and telling her that the rape ‘didn’t happen.’ Crime: Mays and Richmond were today found guilty of digitally penetrating a 16-year-old West Virginia girl at a party last August . On the map: The working class town of Steubenville, located in eastern Ohio, has a population of around 18,000 . Standing in court, convicted of that crime and filled with apparent regret, the rape remained a crime for which he does not apologize. When it came to Richmond’s turn, he walked towards the victim and her family, across the courtroom, weeping; ‘I would like to apologize. I had no intention to put you guys through this. I’m sorry. I don’t know what to say. ‘I ruined her life.’ Across days of often appalling testimony the court has heard texts, tweets and emails between the defendants and their friends. They have heard about pictures, been reminded of vile video rants and seen the reality of what these boys did and how they behaved, who they were, when nobody else was looking. The case has scandalized America and scarred the small town of Steubenville, Ohio. Mays and Richmond will begin their sentence today. They will be taken to an institute just northwest of Columbus, Ohio where they will be assessed and a decision made as to where they should spend their time in custody.","CNN's coverage of the guilty verdict in the Steubenville rape trial in Ohio has been heavily criticized .

A horror film fan twisted a knife into a man's chest while growling like the devil, a court heard. Gary George is accused of murdering supermarket worker Andrew Nall, who was found in his home with 49 stab, slash and cut wounds and carvings on his face and body. George, 42, allegedly twisted a knife into the 53-year-old's body and said: 'It's too late, I have killed him', his co-defendant Christine Holleran said. Holleran, 50, told a jury at Chester Crown Court that there had been a 'ding dong' at Mr Nall's home on in Chester the night he was killed but she left the flat when somebody shouted at her to leave. Christine Holleran (right) accused Gary George (left) of behaving 'like the devil' and plunging a knife into Andrew Nall's chest . Holleran told the court that she returned to see George sitting astride Mr Nall 'like he was riding a horse', stabbing him on the lounge floor. She claims she fled in shock and came back later to find Mr Nall lying on his back near the bedroom and George kneeling over him twisting a knife into his body. 'I will never forget it for as long as I live,' she said. 'Gary was kneeling next to Andy and he was twisting the knife in him.' Holleran, who told the jury George was growling as he stabbed Mr Nall, said: 'He was like the devil'. George, who is allegedly obsessed with Australian horror film 'The Loved Ones' and Holleran are jointly charged with murdering Mr Nall in Chester last August. The pair deny murder although George, of no fixed abode, admits killing Mr Nall but claims it was an act of manslaughter. George has also denied causing grievous bodily harm with intent to homeless man Brian James Riley. Mr Nall was found with 49 stab, slash and cut wounds to his body including a number of unusual carvings on his face and body. The former supermarket worker was found with 49 stab wounds and carvings on his face and body in his Chester home . Holleran had been living with Mr Nall at the time of his killing and has previously told the court the couple were going to get married. She said she had been drinking with Mr Nall and George on the night of August 30 and Mr Nall had put on music and was dancing and showing off a tattoo on his bottom. Holleran said she could not remember going to Bargain Booze with George to buy more alcohol at about 9.30pm that night and denied telling George she had been raped by Mr Nall. She was unable to recall where she had slept on the night Mr Nall was killed or where she had been in the hours after his death, although CCTV footage showed her hugging George in the street on August 31. Holleran said she was too scared to call the police after seeing Mr Nall had been killed. She said: 'He (George) might have stabbed me. He had already put bleach in my eyeballs. 'He was a hard nut, people referred to him as the gangster of Chester. 'Well, he thought he was the gangster of Chester anyway.' Ian Unsworth QC, prosecuting, said to Holleran: 'I put it to you that you are a liar and that you have selective memory when it comes to the killing and injury of Mr Nall. 'You took part in that didn't you?' Holleran replied: 'No. I loved Andy, he meant the world to me. I would never do that.' Mr Unsworth said Holleran had previous convictions for attacking men and she agreed she had a propensity to attack men while drunk. He said: 'You are a cold hearted woman. 'You say you were upset by what had happened to Mr Nall. 'When you were embracing the man you described as the devil were you shedding a tear for Andy then? 'When you saw him twisting the knife in a demonic manner did you shed a tear for Andy then?' Holleran replied: 'I can't remember.'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:15 EST, 18 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:52 EST, 18 March 2013 . Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to act to cut the cost of living, as new figures show the economic downturn left middle income households £3,000-a-year worse off . The disposable income of an average family is twice what it was in the late 1970s, official figures showed yesterday. But the report reveals that the rise is not down to significant tax cuts, as the taxman’s share of middle-class incomes has hardly changed over the past 35 years. The disposable income after taxes and benefits of a middle-earning and working age household is currently £29,900, according to the analysis from the Office for National Statistics. This is a fall from a peak of £31,100 in 2007, before the recession eroded the earnings of middle Britain. But back in 1977, the era of union barons and near national bankruptcy, the average disposable income was half this level when calculated at today’s prices – £15,500. The proportion the Treasury takes from the average income in tax has hardly changed. Instead the state has continued to demand virtually the same share of middle incomes – around a third. This means that, in real cash terms, governments have taken increasing amounts from families. The ONS report says that, at current prices, the taxman was grabbing a little over £8,000 a year from an average income family in 1977, but £14,464 out of their income in 2007, and £12,654 now. It comes as Chancellor George Osborne faces growing calls to act to tackle the rising cost of living in Wednesday's budget. He is expected to scrap planned rises . in fuel duty, offer more help to homebuyers and tax breaks to help . working families with the cost of childcare. There will also be the promise of a flat rate £155-a-week pension and a cap of £73,000 on the costs of social care which an individual will have to find before the state will help. The statistics watchdog examined the . effects of the downturn on the crucial ‘middle fifth’ of the income . distribution range to see how the middle classes were hit. Average incomes for all families rose steadily since the 1970s, until the financial crash in 2007 . Before tax and cash benefits are . taken into account, the average income for non-retired . households in the middle fifth stood at £36,400 in 2007-08 but by . 2010-11 it had fallen by 8.8 per cent to £33,200. The ONS said: ‘This was largely due to . income from wages and salaries falling for this group since the start . of the economic downturn. ‘However, the effect of falling . earnings was partly offset by an increase in the average amount these . households received in cash benefits and a fall in the proportion of . gross income paid in direct taxes.’ After tax, disposable incomes also fell . during the double dip recession but not as steeply. Between 2007-08 and 2010-11, after adjusting for . inflation, the average disposable income the ‘middle fifth’ fell by 3.8 . per cent, from £31,100 a year to £29,900. Should this Budget be George Osborne's last chance to turn around Britain's economy? However, researchers found that over the longer-term, Britons are still much better off than in the 1970s when, allowing for inflation, the average middle income household had a disposable income of £15,500 in 1977. For all households from the richest to the poorest, the median disposable income in 2010-11 was £22,590, wiping out rises since 2005-06. Incomes have also been hit by the coalition's decision to increase VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent in 2010. But at 2010-11 prices, disposable incomes are still much higher than the £10,708 enjoyed by a family in 1977. The revelation that 'squeezed middle' families were left £3,200-a-year worse off by the recession coincides with a survey by consumer watchdog Which? suggested families have curbed their spending by more than £3,000 a year since the economic downturn. As Brits feel the squeeze they are scaling back on buying non-essential items in an attempt to save money, according to consumer watchdog Which?. This frugal attitude has created a £136billion hole in the economy, which is already limping under the strain of austerity measures. The research found that even despite the 2007 financial crash, the middle classes had seen their incomes double in real terms since the 1970s, when economic turmoil and industrial strife saw rubbish piled up in the streets, including in an official rubbish dump in London's Leicester Square . In 1977, the middle fifth of non-retired households paid 16.3 per cent of their gross income in indirect taxes. By 2010/11, this had fallen to 15 per cent, the ONS said . The ONS said there was a close link between average family incomes and the state of the wider economy. Incomes rose during periods of economic growth and fell after the recessions of the early 1980s, early 1990s and late 2000s. For 30 years form 1977, the proportion of income paid in direct taxes remained relatively stable at around 21 to 23 per cent. But since the downturn, the level has fallen to 19.2 per cent, largely as a result of the relative decrease in the amount of income tax paid. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: 'These figures show the real cost of the UK’s living standards crisis for middle Britain, with households thousands of pounds poorer today than five years ago. 'But rather than helping families, the government’s real-terms cut in welfare support next month will make them ever poorer. 'The Chancellor can start putting right this damage in his Budget on Wednesday by cutting VAT, which will save households hundreds of pounds a year. TUC research shows this is the most effective way to help low and middle-income households. 'Cutting VAT and reversing welfare cuts, rather than reducing corporation tax or raising the personal allowance again, would show that the Chancellor is prioritising the living standards of middle Britain over big business and rich households.' The figures show non-retired households have seen sharper rises and bigger falls in their incomes . Increases in the personal tax allowance has contributed to a reduction in the amount the middle fifth now pay in tax, which for direct taxes (income tax, council tax) stood at 19.2 per cent of gross income in 2010/11, compared to 23.5 per cent in 1977. Indirect taxes, such as VAT and fuel duty, have also fallen from 16.3 per cent to 15 per cent, reflecting the reduction in consumer spending during the financial crisis, but has started to rise again since the VAT rate rose to 20 per cent in January 2011. But the figures do show the toll that the credit crunch has taken on households that were previously financially comfortable. The average disposable income of those in the middle who have not yet retired stood at £29,900 in 2010/11, but this has fallen by around 3.8 per cent from the £31,000 it was before the financial crisis hit. The number of non-retired households relying more on the state has also increased, with cash benefits in the middle fifth increasing by 26 per cent since the downturn began - thanks in the main to more retired people receiving the state pension.","From 2007 to 2011, the 'middle fifth' of households saw incomes fall by £3,200-a-year .

Hazel Martinez, 7, died when fire tore through her Bronx apartment in the early hours of yesterday . A seven-year-old girl died and her younger sister was seriously injured after fire swept through their Bronx apartment while the family slept. Firefighters arrived three minutes after the emergency call in the early hours of yesterday morning and pulled Hazel Martinez from the fourth floor apartment, but they were too late to save her. Her half-sister Hailey, aged three, was rushed to hospital where she remains in a critical condition following the fire that is believed to have been caused by faulty wiring. Neighbours said a woman was heard screaming 'My kids, my kids are inside' as the fire tore through the top-floor Fleetwood apartment, home to the girls' father, Shaun Martinez, their mothers, and three other siblings. Hazel's paternal grandfather German Martinez said his heart was broken at the death of the little girl he played football with every Sunday. He said: 'She was the smartest in the whole family, she was the best. He told the New York Daily News: 'She meant the world to me.  She used to tell me "" Grandpa, you are the best of the best.""' Mr Martinez Sr said his son was devastated over the loss of his elder daughter. He told the New York Post: 'My son's torn up over this.  He's in deep shock.' Neighbour Anita Harris, 50, said she watched as firefighters tried to get everyone out of the building, while one emergency services worker performed CPR on one of the girls. She told wsj.com: 'They were screaming ""Fire, get out, get out"".  You couldn't see anything, just black.' Another neighbour, John Matos, told how he kicked the apartment door down but was beaten back by the black smoke, which was too thick for neighbours to get in any further. Hazel's grandfather described her as 'the smartest one in the whole family' and said she had a passion for knowledge . A grab from a television report shows the soot-charred apartment building after fire tore through it yesterday . It took firefighters half an hour to bring the blaze under control, and some were left with minor injuries after battling the fire. Another adult from the apartment was taken to hospital following the blaze and is still receiving treatment. One neighbour said Hazel's mother was in shock following the accident, which is believed to have been caused by wiring on a new stove overheating. Neighbour Johnnie Capeles told ABC News: 'Every which way you looked, there was somebody screaming' This ABC News map shows Grant Avenue in The Bronx, where Hazel Martinez lived with her extended family . It is believed that a small fire started as a result, and the flames may have travelled to a five-tank can of gasoline which had been stored in a nearby cupboard since Hurricane Sandy. Hazel was pronounced dead on arrival at Lincoln Hospital, while her sister is being treated at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Centre. Hazel attended Public School 35 over the road from her brick apartment block, and neighbours said she would often play outside in the street with her little sister.","Hazel Martinez was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital after 3am blaze .

France, race is not recorded on government census forms and people . share a unified Gallic identity, yet high levels of racial . discrimination persist. Melting pot: Despite being a nation of immigrants, America's tip to a white minority has never occurred in its 237-year history and will be a first among the world's major post-industrial societies . 'The American experience has always been a story of color. In the 20th century it was a story of the black-white line. In the 21st century we are moving into a new off-white moment,' says Marcelo Suarez-Orozco, a global expert on immigration and dean of UCLA's Graduate School of Education & Information Studies. 'Numerically, the U.S. is being transformed. The question now is whether our institutions are being transformed,' he said. The shift is being driven by the modern wave of U.S. newcomers from Latin America and Asia. Their annual inflow of 650,000 people since 1965, at a rate that's grown in recent years, surpasses the pace of the last great immigration wave a century ago. That influx, from 1820 to 1920, brought . in Irish, Germans, Italians and Jews from Europe and made the gateway of . Ellis Island, New York, an immigrant landmark, symbolizing freedom, . liberty and the American dream. An equal factor is today's aging white population, mostly baby boomers, whose coming wave of retirements will create a need for first- and second-generation immigrants to help take their place in the workforce. Currently 63 per cent of the U.S. population, the white share is expected to drop below 50 per cent by 2043, when racial and ethnic minorities will collectively become a U.S. majority. Hispanics will drive most of the minority growth, due mostly to high birth rates, jumping in share from 17 per cent to 26 per cent. The pace of assimilation for today's Latinos and Asian-Americans is often compared with that of the Poles, Irish, Italians and Jews who arrived around the turn of the 20th century and eventually merged into an American white mainstream. There was a backlash. By the 1930s, an immigrant-weary America had imposed strict quotas and closed its borders. Those newly arrived were pushed to conform and blend in with a white mainstream, benefiting from New Deal economic programs that generally excluded blacks. The immigration quotas also cut off the supply of new workers to ethnic enclaves and reduced social and economic contacts between immigrants and their countries of origin. 'America of the Melting Pot comes to End,' read a 1924 opinion headline in The New York Times. The author, a U.S. senator, pledged that strict new immigration quotas would 'preserve racial type as it exists here today.' Today, data show that Latinos are embracing U.S. life but also maintaining strong ties to their heritage, aided by a new stream of foreign-born immigrants who arrive each year. Hispanics, officially an ethnic group, strive to learn English and 1 in 4 intermarry, taking a white spouse. Nowadays, immigrants face less pressure to conform than did their counterparts from a century ago. Latinos are protected as a minority, benefiting from the 1950s civil rights movement pioneered by blacks. Nearly 40 per cent of Latinos now resist a white identity on census forms, checking a box indicating 'some other race' to establish a Hispanic race identity. Data: The white share of the U.S. population has been steadily declining since 1980, and is currently at 63 per cent . While growing diversity is often a . step toward a post-racial U.S., sociologists caution that the politics . of racial diversity could just as easily become more magnified. A . first-of-its-kind AP poll conducted in 2011 found that a slight . majority of whites expressed racial bias against Hispanics and that . their attitudes were similar to or even greater than the bias they held . toward blacks. Hispanics also remained somewhat residentially segregated from whites in lower-income neighborhoods, hurt in part by the disappearance of good-paying, midskill manufacturing jobs that helped white ethnics rise into the middle class during most of the 20th century. It long has been assumed by sociologists that Latinos eventually would be redefined as 'white' as they joined the mainstream, but the Census Bureau now wants to classify Latinos as their own distinct group in the next census, in 2020. The proposal is based on census research that finds many Latinos do not identify with the current race categories. One possible revision, urged by Kenneth Prewitt, a former bureau director, would drop the word 'race' from the census form altogether, simply offering a set of check boxes for categories such as black, white and Hispanic that is preceded by the question, 'Are you ...?' 'Whether we're tabulating by income or poverty, Hispanic is treated as a de facto race,' said Roberto Ramirez, chief of the Census Bureau's ethnicity and ancestry branch, in an interview. As it stands now, he says, many Latinos are checking 'some other race.' The AP survey was conducted with researchers from Stanford University, the University of Michigan and NORC at the University of Chicago. Harvard economist George Borjas projects that by 2030, the children of today's immigrants will earn on average 10 per cent to 15 per cent less than nonimmigrant Americans, based on past trends, and that Latinos will particularly struggle because of high rates of poverty, lack of citizenship and lower rates of education. In 1940, the children of early 20th-century white ethnics fared much better on average, earning 21.4 per cent more than nonimmigrants. About 35 per cent of Hispanic babies are currently born into poverty, compared with 41 per cent of blacks and 20 per cent for whites. 'How America responds now to the new challenges of racial and ethnic diversity will determine whether it becomes a more open and inclusive society in the future - one that provides equal opportunities and justice for all,' said Daniel Lichter, a Cornell sociologist and past president of the Population Association of America. The demographic shift has spurred debate as to whether some civil-rights era programs, such as affirmative action in college admissions, should begin to focus on income level rather than race or ethnicity. The Supreme Court will rule on the issue by late June. Following a racially lopsided re-election, Obama has spoken broadly about promoting social and economic opportunity. In his State of the Union speech, he said that rebuilding the middle class is 'our generation's task.' Sen Marco Rubio, R-Florida, a rising star of a mostly white Republican party now eager to attract Latino voters, is courting supporters in both English and Spanish in part by pledging programs that would boost 'social mobility.' Rising star: Sen Marco Rubio, a key player in the mostly white Republican party, is now eager to attract Latino voters, courting supporters in both English and Spanish . Left unclear is how much of a role government can or should play in lifting the disadvantaged, in an era of strapped federal budgets and rising debt. The Latino immigrants include Irma Guereque, 60, of Las Vegas, who says enjoying a middle-class life is what's most important to her. Things turned bad for the Mexico native in the recent recession after her work hours as a food server were cut at the Texas Station casino off the Strip. As a result, she couldn't make the mortgage payments on a spacious house she purchased and was forced to move into an apartment with her grandchildren. While she's getting almost full-time hours now, money is often on her mind. Her finances mean retirement is hardly an option, even though she's got diabetes and is getting older. Many politicians are 'only thinking of the rich, and not the poor, and that's not right,' Guereque said in Spanish. 'We need opportunities for everyone.'","Census data shows that non-Hispanic whites will lose their majority by about 2043 .

As a member of Scotland Yard’s elite diplomatic protection unit he was charged with protecting some of the UK’s most powerful people. But married father-of-two Pc Ricci Giff abandoned his front line duties for trysts with his secret lover. Their relationship was only uncovered when colleagues found pictures of her posing naked wearing his gun belt on his mobile phone. Relationship: Photographs and text messages . revealed the relationship between married father-of-two Giff, left, and . Ms Ramsden, right, who committed suicide in December 2011 . Yesterday Giff, 38, wept openly as he was sentenced to nine months in prison for his brazen dereliction of duty. Southwark Crown Court heard how the . officer was responsible for protecting vulnerable buildings including . Downing Street, embassies and the homes of VIPs. He worked 12-hour shifts, touring . Central London on his motorbike, checking on properties and ready to . respond to any emergency, including terrorist attack. But he left his post three times after . striking up an affair with Melissa Ramsden, an attractive PR officer . for the Israeli tourist board. The pair exchanged sordid text . messages, many about his uniform, as they plotted illicit rendezvous’ at . her flat and the Met’s Hendon training base. Trysts: Melissa Ramsden, 37, was public relations manager for Israel's tourism office in London . Their affair only came to light after . Miss Ramsden, 37, who had a history of depression, killed herself over . unrelated work issues. Investigators discovered their text . exchanges on her phone and a photograph of her posing naked with his . Glock 9mm pistol and Taser stun gun. Jailing the shocked officer . yesterday, Judge Anthony Pitts said his crimes could have spelt . ‘disaster’ for those he was meant to be protecting. He said it was ‘quite difficult’ for the officer to respond quickly to an emergency if he was ‘in the middle of making love’. But he added: ‘This is not a court of . morals, I am not here to sentence you for having an affair with a young . woman when you were married and your wife had just had a baby. ‘That is potentially tragic for you but nothing to do with the criminal courts.’ ‘You made it quite difficult for you to respond quickly if you were in the middle of making love to her during these periods. ‘That is the criminality here, here is . your misconduct in a public office, taking yourself out of the line of . duty in a way that is potentially serious.’ ‘The text messages show the nature of the sexual attraction between you and her, perhaps you found it irresistible.’ The court heard Giff joined the Met in . 1998 and eventually joined the respected diplomatic protection group as . an armed motorcycle patrol officer. Israeli embassy: Ms Ramsden worked for the Israeli government tourism office in London, which was part of Giff's patrol route . But in October 2011 he began an affair . with Miss Ramsden after they met at the Israeli Embassy in Kensington, . one of the locations he guarded. Over the next two months they undertook at least five sexual liaisons, including three when he was meant to be on duty. The first took place on October 28 . when he told a fellow patrolman he going to meet a ‘friend’ in . Paddington during a rest break. Instead he travelled to Miss Ramsden’s Kilburn flat where mobile phone records later showed he spent an hour and a half. During the tryst, another police team . spotted his motorcycle outside and alerted the control room, but no . action was taken when he re-appeared and rode off. Jailed: Ricci Giff, seen outside court today, was sentenced to nine months after admitting willful misconduct . Over the next few days, the couple swapped text messages about their encounter and planned to meet up again. Their second illicit meeting took place at the Met’s landmark training complex in Hendon, North West London, on November 5. After starting work at 7pm Giff met her at the sprawling complex, with Miss Ramsden passing through security using a false name, and they spent two hours together. The final encounter took place on December 1, after Giff spent the day guarding Downing Street and travelled to her flat. During the liaison Giff gave Ramsden his utility belt, complete with Glock 9mm pistol and Taser, to wear. She later sent him a picture of herself naked, except for the belt. Four days before Christmas Miss Ramsden sent her lover a text message which thanked him for ‘making her feel loved.’ Hours later she was found slumped beside her bed after taking an overdose. An inquest later heard she faced redundancy and had accused a colleague of bullying her. Prosecutor Claire Howellsaid it was simply down to ‘luck’ that Giff was not suddenly required at an emergency during the encounters. She said: ‘He was fully armed and supposed to be part of a high profile unit guarding very high profile targets. ‘He, more than anyone else, would have appreciated the potentially catastrophic results if anything did occur and his response was delayed.’ The court heard the affair took place during a ‘baby blues’ period following the birth of Giff’s second child with his wife of six years. Defence barrister Richard Atchley said his client, who had an ‘impeccable record’, has been suspended from duty for over a year and will be now be sacked. He said: ‘Mr Goff would to apologise to all those concerned, particularly his wife and the colleagues he has let down at the Metropolitan Police. ‘He has, as a result of his foolhardy involvement with Miss Ramsden, lost the career he sought after. He has paid a high price for his foolish and unprofessional behaviour.’ Speaking after the hearing, Commander Allan Gibson, of the Met, said Giff ‘let himself and his colleagues down’ and it was right he was dealt with by the courts. Giff, of Sandy, Bedfordshire, admitted three counts of misconduct in a public office.","Ricci Giff admitted abandoning post to meet mistress Melissa Ramsden .

Flawed reasoning: Officer Gracey and Jackson argue for 10 minutes as Gracey repeatedly changes his reasoning for giving the ticket -- from Jackson riding his bike in the wrong direction to Jackson annoying him .

The two Boulder, Colorado, police officers responsible for the January 1 shooting of the towering bull elk known as ‘Big Boy’ were arrested on Friday morning and are facing possible jail time. Officers Sam Carter and Brent Curnow are facing felony counts of tampering with physical evidence, attempt to influence a public servant and forgery, as well as misdemeanor charges of unlawful taking of a trophy elk, a Samson law surcharge, killing an elk out of season, use of an electronic device to take an elk, and official misconduct, said District Attorney Stan Garnett. Carter and Curnow could face prison time and the loss of their official police certifications. Scroll down for video . Busted: Boulder, Colorado, police officers Sam Carter and Brent Curnow, pictured, responsible for the January 1 shooting of the towering bull elk known as 'Big Boy,' were arrested on Friday morning and are facing possible jail time . On thin ice: The two officers are facing multiple felony counts and misdemeanor charges, said District Attorney Stan Garnett . The officers, who are on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation by the Boulder Police Department, were released on $20,000 apiece, the Denver Post reported. According to an arrest affidavit, Carter told police the day after the shooting that he encountered an elk on January 1 that he said was injured and needed to be put down. Carter then blasted the animal with a shotgun, and Curnow, who was off-duty at the time, came to pick up the carcass with the help of an on-duty Boulder County sheriff's deputy, identified as Jeff George, the affidavit states. Carter did not report the incident or notify his supervisors that he had fired his weapon that night, though he told investigators that he called in the incident and said he did not know why dispatch had no record of it, according to the affidavit. However, cell phone records obtained from phone carriers for Carter, Curnow and George show the shooting was premeditated. Guardian: The elk had been seen around the community for several days before he was shot . Carter texted Curnow at 2:56am, about ten hours before the shooting, on New Year's Day saying, ‘found wapiti (elk) you up?’ That was followed by a text at 4:14am saying, ‘Should I go hunting?’ Carter also texted George that night. At 2:45pm, Curnow texted ‘You should have killed it’ to Carter. Carter responded, ‘Oh he's dead tonight. His right side is broke off at main beam. And he looks a little smaller. He may not be wapiti, but he's gonna die.’ When Curnow texted ‘Get him’ to Carter after 10pm, Carter replied, ‘Too many people right now.’Two minutes before midnight, Carter texted ‘Elk down’ to Curnow. All of the texts and phone calls from that night had been erased from Carter and Curnow's phones when they were seized for evidence. Carter allegedly had also applied for a road kill permit with the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department, saying the elk had broken an antler off. Investigators believe Curnow had sawed the antler off. Spirit: Many admired the elk for its grace . According to the Colorado Peace Officer Standards and Training Board, a Colorado police officer could lose his certification for any felony conviction or one of 43 misdemeanors, including first-degree official misconduct. The Boulder Police Department is conducting an internal personnel investigation into Carter and Curnow In addition to the criminal investigation. Both officers have been placed on paid leave. George also is subject to an internal probe, but he has not been suspended from duty. The neighboring Colorado community was shaken by the . loss of their beloved elk and held a walk to honor the creature while . accusing the local police department of cruelly misusing their . authority. Several dozen . residents of Boulder marched in a silent protest last Sunday, some blaring . elk calls on their outstretched cell phones. Remembering Big Boy: A woman holds her cell phone, which is blaring elk sounds, as she participates in a walk to honor Big Boy the Elk, who was shot to death by a police officer on January 1 . Memorial: Dozens of people in Boulder, Colorado marched in a silent protest to remember Big Boy on Sunday . 'We're concerned about the larger culture of misconduct that needs to be addressed in order for taxpaying voters to regain trust in the department,' a resident involved in the walk told CBS Denver. The walk was just one in a series of events for the late Big Boy. The week prior, the community held a candlelight vigil in his honor. The massive creature was described as their 'guardian' by some. Curnow had been with the department for 14 years, according to the Boulder Daily Camera. The Daily Camera revealed that the suspended officer owns a taxidermy website, which advertises 'quality taxidermy at an affordable price,' according to the paper. It is believed that Curnow and Carter were going to cut up the animal for its meat. There were mixed reports from Boulder residents that the bull elk had been behaving aggressively before it was shot.

A couple who said they were left a £500,000 legacy by an 80-year old 'spoilt princess' because she was cross with her family have been stripped of the money by a High Court judge. Grieving widow Iris Jolly was said to have cut her relatives out of her will because she felt they were not taking enough notice of her in her final years. Mrs Jolly, the matriarch of a large family of 'Cockney costermongers' from Canning Town, east London, died in October 2010, less than two months after drawing up a will for the first time. Richard and Pamela Phythian have been stripped of their inheritance from Iris Jolly by a High Court judge . The will left everything she owned to the 'dear friends' Richard Phythian and his wife Pamela. Mr Phythian, an ex-firefighter honoured with an MBE for his role as General Secretary of the National Association of Fire Officers, and his wife, said the old lady had every reason to be generous to them. As close friends who had done a great deal for her in her final years, they insisted Mrs Jolly was disgruntled with her relatives 'because ""The Princess"" wasn't the centre of attention' any more. But a judge ruled that the will is invalid because Mrs Jolly was not in her right mind when she signed it. The court earlier heard Mrs Jolly signed the will despite having an extensive network of living relatives. Her bequest to the Phythians included her most valuable asset - her £500,000 house in Yalding, Kent. Iris Jolly was not in her right mind when she signed the will in August 2010, a judge ruled . Mr Phythian had 'made himself extremely useful' to Mrs Jolly in the three years after the death of her husband Alf in 2007. He drew up and witnessed her will himself as well as acting as her sole executor, the family's barrister Mark Blackett-Ord told the court. Mrs Jolly's niece, Lynda Turner, 51, argued that the 'difficult' and increasingly frail 80-year-old lacked the legal capacity to make a valid will and that she did not 'know and approve' of its contents. Mrs Turner, 51, insisted the whole family had remained close until the end of Mrs Jolly's life. 'I wouldn't be here today if I didn't know she was going to leave her estate to her family,' she said in a previous court appearance. 'Iris was almost like a second mother to myself and my brothers and sisters.' Mr Blackett-Ord said Mrs Jolly - whose family members said was 'treated as a princess and indulged and always put first' - had gone into a 'catastrophic mental decline' following the death of her husband in 2007 and her twin brother John in June 2010. He described her state of mind at the time of the will as 'severe, even psychotic, depression or pathological bereavement reaction.' Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, for the Phythians, who are in their 70s and live near Sevenoaks, urged the judge to uphold the will - the only one Mrs Jolly ever made - as valid. He claimed that 'Iris's temper' and the 'tongue lashings that everyone received from Iris' had caused a rift between her and the rest of the family. 'By the time of Alf's death, she was no longer the centre of attention,' he said. 'The family support she depended on as ""The Princess"" wasn't available. 'The reality is that this unusual woman was carrying on at her death as she had carried on in life, wanting to be the centre of attention.' Mr Blackett-Ord claimed: 'A lonely, housebound, childless widow was obviously open to suggestion.' 'Mr Phythian was not a man to miss an opportunity for making suggestions for his own advancement.' Judge Viven Rose, ruling on the case, said: 'The Phythians' case is that Iris decided to leave all her property to them because she was not on good terms with her family and that they neglected her during her final years. Home: This house in Yalding, Kent made up the vast majority of the value of the disputed will . 'Mr Phythian also recalled that Iris had told him about various angry rows that she had with John over the years.' But she added: 'Mr Phythian would have to have very little understanding of human nature to interpret Iris' complaints about John's behaviour as meaning that Iris would be unperturbed by her twin brother's death.' The judge concluded that, when she signed the will, Mrs Jolly 'was suffering from an affective disorder brought about by her deep grief at the death of her brother, combined with her continuing fragile mental state arising from her advanced age, her physical frailty and her continuing grief for her husband. She said: 'I do not regard Mr Phythian as a dishonest person. I do not believe that he decided to befriend Iris with the cynical intention at the outset of eventually drawing up her will to his own benefit. 'I have concluded that the help he and Mrs Phythian gave Iris, as well as his rather judgmental and disapproving attitude towards her family, have generated in Mr Phythian's mind an inappropriate sense of entitlement to Iris' property. 'She was a person whose mental state was fragile throughout her adult life, particularly in response to bereavement. 'In my view, therefore, in August 2010 when the will was made, [the evidence] indicates that Iris was likely to be undergoing a severe grief reaction to John's death. Mrs Jolly's nieces Lynda Turner, left, and Pat Jolly, right, said the inheritance should be theirs . Judge Rose continued: 'I have seen photographs taken at John's funeral which show a rather disheveled and very thin elderly woman being supported by family members. 'Mr Phythian challenged this evidence and said that, although Iris was physically frail, she was not vague or confused. On this point though I prefer the evidence of the Jolly family. 'The fact that I have found that Iris did not have mental capacity to make the will means that she did not know or approve of the contents of the will either. 'There is no evidence from anyone other than Mr Phythian that Iris ever read the will or had the will read out to her. 'Taking into account all the evidence I have heard about how the will came to be made and the relationship between Iris and her family, on one hand, and the relationship between Iris and the Phythians on the other hand, I am sure that Iris could not have known or approved the contents of her will. 'The contested will is invalid on two grounds,' the judge concluded, stripping the Phythians of their inheritance and declaring that Mrs Jolly died intestate. The money will now pass to Mrs Jolly's next of kin.","Iris Jolly cut whole family out of her will two months before her death in 2010 .

In a rambling interview with The New York Post from Rikers Island where she is in custody, Erika Menendez, 31, said she was furious the day she ended the life of the hard-working Indian-born Sunando Sen, 46. 'My mind was just racing that day. I was mad. I was just angry,' Menendez said. 'I was homeless. I was hungry. I was fighting with my boyfriend.

'He was trying to shake me off,' she told The Post. Clad in a prison jumpsuit with glassy eyes and greasy hair, Menendez professed her hatred for Muslims and Hindus and told The Post the murder of Sen, a Hindu, was revenge for 9/11. But the massive loss of life that still haunts the nation isn't what enraged her. 'I'm not mad about the people. I'm mad because I liked the buildings,' Menendez said. 'I just wanted to hurt Muslims and Hindus ever since (9/11).' She loved the World Trade Center buildings because she is a native New Yorker, she said.

She hardly showed emotion during the interview, The Post reported, but her eyes lit up when she began describing other attacks on people she believed were Muslim or Hindu. 'I've been beating up Muslims and Hindus for a long time. I just want to hurt them. I would punch them,' she said. She told The Post that on December 29, Sen stood out from the other subway riders because of his religion but the horrific death may have been averted if she'd taken her medicine. The mentally ill woman, who was last week deemed fit to stand trial, revealed to The Post that she hadn't taken her drugs that day because she hates the side effects, which make her 'shaky.'

She said she prefers to 'self-medicate' by smoking marijuana but she hadn't smoked a 'blunt' that day. 'If I smoked a blunt that day, I wouldn't have pushed him,' Menendez said. As the remorseless woman described the subway killing, which was the second in a month in New York, Sen's friends struggled to come to terms with his tragic death. 'How could she do this to him? My hands shake. I can't be alone. I think of him all the time, all the time,' the woman he rented a room from in Queens told The Post. She said her son was now scared to ride the subway.

But she has revealed that she was horrified to learn that people who live near her have been posting signs attacking her laugh and her relationship status. The messages on traffic lights and cars along her street  read: 'There's not just nice . people living in this neighbourhood but people who are fake and . annoying. Their fake laughter can be heard a kilometre away. 'This particular neighbour. Terrible lady. Poor son - now that dad is no longer there.' The Dutch model seems to be perplexed about . the abuse telling German newspaper Bild yesterday: 'I cannot explain it. And I love Hamburg so much.' When the interviewer suggested she move to Dusseldorf if the campaign carries on she replied neutrally: 'It is not easy to look into the future. But Dusseldorf is certainly a great city.' But her former partner was . angered by the signs and The Sun reported he told the newspaper: 'It's an outrage. Sylvie . doesn't deserve this. People can't do stuff like this.' When the newspaper asked how she was adapting to life as a single mother she said: 'I still have time to do what I enjoy (smiles). For example, go to the hairdresser..

Quack: Kimberly Smedley, 45, faces five years in prison after illegally injecting woman across the U.S. with dangerous silicone . An unlicensed cosmetic surgeon has pleaded guilty to conspiracy after she traveled across the U.S. injecting industrial silicone into the buttocks of female customers. Kimberly Smedley, 45, faces up to five years in prison for operating her illegal practice out of hotel rooms in Baltimore, Washington, Detroit, Philadelphia and New York. She kept the silicone in a water jug for the procedures - and used 'super glue with cotton balls to prevent silicone leaking out' of the women's flesh. She charged '$500 and $1,600, always in cash, for . each session where she typically injected silicone in nine places on each . side of the buttocks', according to court papers. Smedley, from Atlanta, Georgia, told clients that the silicone was medical grade. However it was actually intended for metal or plastic lubrication, as an additive for paint and coatings, and furniture or automotive polishes, according to Baltimore district court. The therapist offered to inject the chemical 'into the buttocks of customers for larger and fuller buttocks in exchange for money' according to the smokinggun.com.  Many of her customers between 2003 and 2011 were strippers. The 45-year-old is due to be sentenced in July and as part of a plea deal, will be fined $250,000. She had used her earnings to fund a lavish lifestyle, driving a luxury SUV and living in an exclusive Altanta neighbourhood where homes are worth around $500,000. Smedley was investigated last year after one woman fell seriously ill from receiving silicone injections. She was arrested at a hotel in Washington D.C. as she was preparing to see customers for  treatments. In 2008, during an investigation by the New York Post, Smedley told a reporter: 'I can't tell you if you'll have scars or not. You have to know your . own body. You need to be sure of what you're doing. I'm not promising . anything.' Lavish life: Smedley, 45, (with unidentified male) charged $500 to $1,600 each time for silicone injections . Makeshift practice: Smedley reportedly saw clients in hotel rooms across the U.S. to administer injections including this one in downtown Washington D.C. Illegal silicone injections, often used by sex workers and those in the transgender community to alter their appearance, are incredibly dangerous and even life-threatening. Dr M.R. Khalifeh, a registered plastic surgeon, told Fox: 'We see long-term effects six months to a year later...the silicone can bubble to the surface and cause chronic infections. It is really difficult to treat.' Smedley's actions came to light after another practitioner of illegal silicone buttock injections was jailed earlier this month. Padge-Victoria Windslowe, a transgender . hip-hop singer who calls herself 'Black Madam', faced charges in connection with the . killing of a woman who died after a botched bottom implant. Windslowe, 42, was about to host a 'pumping party' in Philadelphia, where women receive black market implants, when she was apprehended. An unidentified 23-year-old woman, reportedly an . exotic dancer, was treated for a blocked artery in the lung and spent . seven days in hospital. She later died of complications caused by . an illegal implant allegedly made by Windslowe. Arrested: 'Black Madam', also known as Padge-Victoria Windslowe, was about to host a 'pumping party' at a home in Philadelphia when she was apprehended, police said .

Some 30 people across the U.S. have come forward with claims they were scammed by Morris. One alleged victim Rajee Narinesingh, accused Morris of making her 'into a . monster' after she received several procedures from her in . 2005. Narinesingh, a transgendered woman, wanted fuller lips, cheeks and chin, but could not afford an operation by a licensed plastic surgeon, using medical silicone and said she had heard about the 'fake doctor' by word of mouth through the transgender community. After being injected with a cocktail of toxins she allegedly left with lumpen shapes in her cheeks, a misshapen chin and a ballooning upper lip. She later had to pay a real surgeon to repair the botched job. A court was told that Morris used super glue to patch up entry wounds in the skin. Morris has been charged with two felony counts of practising medicine without a license with serious injury. She had pleaded not guilty and was out on bond. Authorities have said more charges could be forthcoming.","Kimberly Smedley operated in hotels across the U.S. for 8 years .

"By . Jessica Satherley . UPDATED: . 19:41 EST, 12 November 2011 . At the end of a long shift, a group of workers at Japan’s wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant head back to their lockers and collect their belongings. Dressed in protective suits, these are men working on an on-going project inside the emergency operation centre, located 150 miles northeast of Tokyo, which will take approximately 30 years to dismantle the reactors after a cold shutdown was achieved. Following the devastation of Japan’s tsunami in March, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the utility operating the plant, managed to stabilise conditions so workers could enter the reactor buildings, but there is still danger involved for those working there. Ending a long shift: Workers in protective suits gather near their lockers inside the emergency operation center at the crippled Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power station in Okuma, Japan . Pretty in pink: A makeshift office where workers pick up their protective suits, masks and gloves is surrounded by protective sheets . Workers engaged in the recovery effort are stationed at J-Village, a national soccer training centre near Daiichi, in Okuma, that has been converted into an operational base. Tepco says up to 3,300 workers a day arrive from J-Village, located on the edge of the 20 km no-entry zone - designed to protect residents from radiation after the disaster. At J-Village, workers on their way to the plant line up at a white tent to change into protective gear. Every day when they return, the workers discard their protective clothing, which is treated as radioactive waste and stored. A Tepco spokesperson said every piece of discarded clothing has been kept there since March 17, about 480,000 sets heaped in large piles or put in bed-sized containers and stacked in rows. Protective gear: Workers on their way to the plant line up at a white tent to change into protective gear, which is discarded at the end of every day as nuclear waste . Huge project: Up to 3,300 workers a day arrive from J-Village (where they live), located on the edge of the 20 km no-entry zone - created to protect residents from radiation after the disaster . And today the life of the workers is able to be seen by the public, as Japan took a group of journalists inside the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant for the first time. They were told by officials that conditions at Fukushima have been slowly improving to the point where a ‘cold shutdown’ would be possible as planned. Officials shepherded a group of about 30 mainly Japanese journalists through the plant for the first time since the meltdown of the plant's reactors, the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl 25 years ago. Cooling systems at the plant were knocked out by the powerful tsunami and evidence of the devastation was clear to see. The nuclear reactor buildings are still surrounded by crumpled trucks, twisted metal fences, and large, dented water tanks. Men in white: Workers dressed in protective suits wait outside a building at at J-Village, a soccer training complex now serving as an operation base for those battling Japan's nuclear disaster . Organised effort: Men sort and clean protective masks at J-Village, near Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Fukushima . Smaller office buildings around the reactors were left as they were abandoned on March 11, when the tsunami hit. Cranes fill the skyline in testimony to recovery efforts. Journalists on the tour mainly stayed on a bus as they were driven around the plant and were not allowed near the reactor buildings. Still, they all had to wear protective suits, double layers of gloves and plastic boot covers and hair nets. All carried respiration masks and radiation detectors. ‘From the data at the plant that I have seen, there is no doubt that the reactors have been stabilised,’ Masao Yoshida, chief of the Daiichi plant, told the group. Media frenzy: Journalists, wearing protective suits, interview Japan's Minister of the Environment, Goshi Hosono, and Chief of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant . Radiation screening: Two workers are directed through a radiation screening center inside a gymnasium after returning to J-Village . Protocol checks: A man is checked for radiation after arriving at a vehicle decontamination center at J-Village . The compound may still be littered with rubble, but Tepco has succeeded in bringing down the temperatures at the three damaged reactors from levels considered dangerous. They are confident they will be able to declare a ‘cold shutdown’ when temperatures are stable below boiling point, as scheduled by the end of this year. While Tepco had managed to stabilise conditions so workers could enter the reactor buildings, Yoshida said there was still danger involved for those working there. The disaster prompted the government to declare a 20 km (12 miles) no-entry zone around the plant, forcing the evacuation of about 80,000 residents. Radioactive waste: Piles of used protective clothing that was worn by workers inside the contaminated 'exclusion zone' sit inside a soccer field waiting to be placed inside containers . Office workers: Tokyo Electric Power Co. employees work inside the emergency operation center at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station . Safety barrier: A makeshift storm surge barrier fortifies Fukushima . Open day: Japanese officials wearing protective suits and masks ride in the back of a bus while a second bus carrying officials and Japanese journalists follow . A cold shutdown is one of the conditions that must be met before the government considers lifting its entry ban. As an emergency measure early in the crisis, Tepco tried to cool the damaged reactors by pumping in huge volumes of water, much of it from the sea, only to leave a vast amount of tainted runoff that threatened to leak out into the ocean. It solved the problem by building a cooling system to clean the radioactive runoff, using some of the water to cool the reactors. A group of white tents houses the cleaning facility. In front were hoisted the flags of the United States, France and Japan, the countries that provided the technology for the decontamination system. ‘Every time I come back, I feel conditions have improved. This is due to your hard work,’ Japan's environment and nuclear crisis minister Goshi Hosono told workers at the plant.

A teenage boy collapsed in court today as he gave evidence against a child soap star who allegedly sexually assaulted him when he was just 14-years-old. The performing arts student, now 17, claims the actor molested him on a ‘weekly basis’ between August and September 2010 at their stage school in an attempt to prove to his girlfriend that he was bisexual. The teenager had been giving evidence in the witness box for 20 minutes at Blackfriars Crown Court from behind a curtain when a loud thud and what sounded like a fall could be heard from the public gallery. The courtroom was cleared while the witness received medical treatment. Court hearing: A 17-year-old child soap star is on trial at Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured, for allegedly molesting a fellow student at a stage school in London over two months in 2010 . The judge said he is now considering allowing the boy to give evidence via videolink as the experience appeared to be too much for him. The actor, who cannot be named as he . is underage himself, allegedly attacked the boy while they attended the same stage school in London. The alleged victim said he had heard the defendant, who was 15 at the time, was ‘jealous’ about his friendship with his girlfriend. The attacks allegedly began soon afterwards. Jurors heard the TV star forced . himself on the teenager in a stairwell and in three further attacks he . molested his victim in a cellar, male changing room and the men’s . toilets. He now faces three counts of sexual assault and one count of rape on the boy between July and September 2010. Opening the case at Blackfriars Crown . Court, prosecutor Timothy Forster said the 17-year-old actor admits . having sexual encounters with the victim but claims it was consensual. He told the jury of seven men and five . women the abuse started after the defendant’s girlfriend, who was also a . friend of the victim, asked him if he was gay. After hearing about their conversation the defendant later approached the victim, who is now 17, and told him: 'I think I’m bi'. Mr Forster said: 'The victim took that . to mean he was telling him he was bisexual. He then asked him to come . downstairs with him but he refused. 'The defendant then sent him a picture . of his erect penis and asked the victim to send a similar picture in . return but he wasn’t interested. 'The defendant continued to text him . saying he had to prove to his girlfriend that he was bi saying he wanted . to ""do it"" with him. And he said that his girlfriend could watch.' During the first alleged attack at the school in July 2010, where students at the 100-year-old stage school were . performing their end of year show, the defendant is said to have forced . the victim down a staircase. The prosecutor continued: 'Half way . down he told him he had to prove [he was bisexual] because his . girlfriend had been with a girl so he had to be with a boy. 'The victim was not interested in . returning the defendant’s overtures....there were incidents on a weekly . basis, none of which were wanted, but he was scared to stop the . defendant doing what he did.' The stage school then broke up for the summer holidays but when they returned the victim claims the abuse started again. A few days into the new term he was . standing at the urinals in the men’s toilets when the defendant . allegedly came in and touched him before trying to sexually assault him. Another time the defendant rubbed himself . against the victim in a men’s changing room, it was claimed. And when the victim again rejected his advances he sat down and openly masturbated in front of him, it was said. The actor was arrested in May 2012 as . the victim did not initially tell anyone because he felt ‘shocked and . ashamed,’ it was said. The defendant, from Surrey, denies the charges against him.

A former Apple CEO has warned the company needs to launch cheaper products or risk missing opportunities in emerging markets. John Sculley, who was boss of the tech giant from 1983 to 1993, said the firm could lose out to its competitors if it fails to launch more affordable products. His warnings followed predictions he made last month that Apple is 'a few years' away from another 'creative leap' like the iPad. John Sculley (left) who as CEO of Apple oversaw the ousting of Steve Jobs (right) has said Apple needs to launch cheaper products or risk losing out to Samsung and Google in emerging markets . John Sculley saw Apple sales increase tenfold when he worked as CEO between 1983 and 1993 . Mr Sculley, who oversaw the firing of Steve Jobs, said: 'Apple is now being challenged by the . combination of Samsung and Google... Apple makes really good products, and Samsung makes really . good products. He told the Huffington Post: 'It’s really a two-horse race. Where I think Apple is . exposed: the price points of Apple’s products are just so high by . comparison with Samsung’s. 'My sense is that there’s a big opportunity . that Apple is either going to miss if it doesn’t bring out lower-priced . products for emerging markets, or that it can end up getting and . becoming huge success story if does.' In developing markets Apple has failed to dominate the tech industry as it has in the western world.

John Sculley who owns an iPad, an iPhone (left) and a Samsung Galaxy Note (right) said Samsung and Apple both make 'really good products' In India the company has around a five percent market share, compared to 40 percent for Samsung - which offers vast product variety at a range of prices. In Indonesia smartphones cost around $120 while an Apple equivalent sets consumers back $800. Mr Sculley, who is now a venture capitalist, confessed to owning an iPhone and an iPad as well as a Galaxy Note. He added he thought the 'lull' at Apple was due to the current state of technology. 'You can only surf the big wave when there are big waves, and there are moments when technology is poised for innovators to come in and do something spectacular, and then there are other moments when you just have to play out an opportunity and wait for next big wave to come along.'","John Sculley said Apple must make cheap products or lose out to Samsung .

Texts sent by the murdered wife of a former NYPD police officer could be used to convict her husband from beyond the grave, it emerged on Monday. Edwin Coello, 38, who has a record of allegedly abusing women, is on trial at Bronx Supreme Court, New York, accused of beating and strangling his estranged wife and dumping her body in the woods. Prosecutors say Coello, 41, flew into a violent rage after his wife, Tina Adovasio, 40, told him in text messages she wanted a divorce because she suspected him of cheating. Aggressive: Angry texts exchanged by Tina Adovasio, left, and husband Edwin Coello, right, could be used in court in an effort to convict the former police officer of killing his wife . In one, she told him that if he wanted to 'live his life as a single guy’ he should 'take his s**t' and get out. The texts were read at a pre-trial hearing on a defence motion to keep the jury from seeing the confrontational texts. Ms Adovasio, a nurse, vanished March 6, 2011, from her Bronx home. Her body was found six days later in a wooded area off the Taconic Parkway in Yorktown Heights. The angry missives about Coello’s alleged cheating were retrieved from Coello’s phone by Detective John Fennelli shortly after the former policeman was arrested at his home, according to the New York Post. In one, Coello told his suspicious wife that he was having trouble getting home because of flooded highways. She replied: 'Do you really think I’m stupid to believe highways are flooded after sun out all day. Really?' Mystery: Ms Adovasio's beaten and strangled body was found in a wooded area off a quiet New York road . Coello ignored her question and asked, 'R U cooking?' But Adovasio wrote back: '[I] hope you have money saved for your lawyer cause you’ll need it. 'I only have to make a call and you are so pathetic you think I have no where I could go.' He replies: 'cooking?' At another point, she wrote: 'Tired of you and your disrespectful ways - can’t stay in this relationship', according to a transcript Det Fennelli read in court. Coello’s lawyer, Renee Hill, asked Judge Ralph Fabrizio to throw out the text messages and the testimony of former girlfriend Glory Perez, who described the alleged abuse that got him kicked out of the NYPD in 2000. Ms Hill refused to talk about the evidence until after the judge makes a ruling. Prosecutors want to introduce a handwritten alibi they say Coello concocted to describe the final moments before his wife’s disappearance. 'Violent past': Both Coello's ex-girlfriend Glory Perez, left, and his murdered wife Ms Adovasio, right, accused him of domestic abuse . 'Tina was there,' he wrote. 'Spoke with trying to explain [I] am not cheating on her. 'She was very upset with me. She wanted to hit me with right hand. Grabbed it and she started to scream at me that she was leaving and clawed me with left hand. She received a text and left stating something like ""it's my turn. See how you like it.""' Coello told police she stormed out of their home after the fight, but his alibi unravelled after security video showed him leaving their apartment building alone carrying a duffel bag. After he lost his job as a policeman, Coello returned to his old post as a doorman at a luxury Upper East Side building. His volatile marriage to Ms Adovasio was marred by several incidents of domestic trouble. In February 2005, Coello pleaded guilty to second-degree harassment after a domestic incident and received a conditional discharge. In February 2007, he was arrested for an attack that landed her in a hospital. That case was sealed. In November 2010, police were called to their home after a fight, but no arrests were made. Ms Adovasio was the mother of Coello’s six-year-old daughter and had three children from a previous marriage. Coello was placed in protective custody after his arrest last year.","Tina Adovasio, 40, exchanged angry texts with Edwin Coello before her death .

An amateur footballer was gunned down by a gangland hitman in front of 150 spectators as he was warming up for a match with teammates. Alan Jopson, 27, was doing stretch exercises just before kick-off at a playing field in Liverpool when the masked gunman calmly jogged on to the pitch and shot him in the legs. The victim was hit three times in both legs and lay reeling in agony as the would-be assassin fled in a silver getaway car. Crowd in shock: Alan Jopson was gunned down when a hitman jogged calmly on to a pitch at Simpson Playing Fields, Liverpool, on Saturday afternoon . Jopson, who plays for West Derby side Alder, was treated in hospital for non life-threatening injuries and is believed to have given a statement to police. Liverpool is currently in the grip of a string of tit-for-tat shootings. The gunman struck shortly before 2pm on Saturday as the match between amateur league clubs Allerton FC and Alder, in Division 1 of the Liverpool County Premier League, was about to kick off. As the teams ventured out on to a pitch at the busy Simpson Playing Fields in Woolton, the gunman pulled into the car park at the grounds in a silver vehicle, got out and ran on to the grass after them. Peter Woods, Allerton secretary, said: 'I was in the changing room and the next thing I knew, when I went outside to watch the game, everyone was running away as fast as they could. 'There must have been 100 people there, maybe 150, all milling around. Everyone just fled. 'I couldn't believe it when I found out that the lad had been shot. The city is gun crazy - shootings outside schools, on football pitches. It is ridiculous.' Liverpool County Premier league . secretary Iain Munro said: 'It's a busy ground and a number of games . were about to start. It's shocking. 'We know it's not a football-related incident. The victim was targeted as the person knew where they were playing football. The gunman came on the field while the teams were warming up, identified a player, and shot him three times.' The game was immediately abandoned and the car park, the playing fields and surrounding area were cordoned off for forensic investigations to take place. A spokesman for Alder FC also said the incident was 'not football-related'. He added: 'We have got absolutely nothing to do with what happened.' Merseyside Police confirmed the shooting was a targeted attack, but the motive was not yet known. Ch Supt Ngaire Waine said: 'It's a very rare thing to happen anywhere - let alone a football pitch. 'It was brazen reckless attack in full daylight which showed a total disregard for the safety of other people. We've identified over 80 people who witnessed it.

Kim Dotcom is launching a new file sharing website called Mega exactly a year after the FBI shut down his old site Megaupload and charged him with online piracy. Dotcom, who is currently on bail and faces jail if found guilty, said the new site was not revenge on U.S. authorities who planned a raid on his £16million New Zealand Mansion. Dotcom said his new offering, Mega.co.nz, which will launch on Sunday, complied with the law and warned that attempts to take it down would be futile. Defiant: Kim Dotcom is launching a new file sharing website called Mega exactly a year after the FBI shut down his old site Megaupload and charged him with online piracy . 'This is not some kind of finger to the U.S. government or to Hollywood'  Dotcom told Reuters at his sprawling estate in the bucolic hills of Coatesville, just outside Auckland, New Zealand, a country known more for sheep, rugby and the Hobbit than flamboyant tech tycoons. 'Legally, there's just nothing there that could be used to shut us down. This site is just as legitimate and has the right to exist as Dropbox, Boxnet and other competitors,' he said, referring to other popular cloud storage services. Dotcom and three colleagues are currently awaiting the result of an appeal over an extradition order from New Zealand to the United States. His lawyer, Ira Rothken, added that launching the site was compliant with the terms of Dotcom's bail conditions. U.S. prosecutors argue that Dotcom in a statement said he had no intention of starting a new internet business until his extradition was resolved. Dotcom said Mega was a different . beast to Megaupload, as the new site enables users to control exactly . which users can access uploaded files, in contrast to its predecessor, . which allowed users to search files, some of which contained copyrighted . content, allegedly without permission. A . sophisticated encryption system will allow users to encode their files . before they upload them on to the site's servers, which Dotcom said were . located in New Zealand and overseas. Each . file will then be issued a unique, sophisticated decryption key which . only the file holder will control, allowing them to share the file as . they choose. New venture: Dotcom insists his new offering, Mega.co.nz, which will launch on Sunday, complied with the law and warned that attempts to take it down would be futile . Tweets: Dotcom announces the launch of new site Mega on Twitter . As a result, the site's operators . would have no access to the files, which they say would strip them from . any possible liability for knowingly enabling users to distribute . copyright-infringing content, which Washington says is illegal. 'Even if we wanted to, we can't go into your file and snoop and see what you have in there,' Dotcom added. Dotcom said Mega would comply with orders from copyright holders to remove infringing material, which will afford it the 'safe harbour' legal provision, which minimises liability on the condition that a party acted in good faith to comply. But some legal experts say it may be difficult to claim the protection if they do not know what users have stored. The Motion Pictures Association of America said encrypting files alone would not protect Dotcom from liability. 'We'll . reserve final judgment until we have a chance to analyse the new . project,' a spokesman told Reuters. ""But given Kim Dotcom's history, . count us as sceptical.' The . German national, who also goes by Kim Schmitz, expects huge interest in . its first month of operation, which would be a far cry from when . Megaupload went live in 2005. 'I would be surprised if we had less than one million users,' Dotcom said. German Dotcom, who also goes by the name Kim Schmitz, expects huge interest in his new site . Mega's launch starts the next chapter of the Dotcom narrative, dotted with previous cyber crime-related arrests and whose twists and turns have been scrutinised by all facets of the entertainment industry, from film studios and record labels to internet service companies and teenage gamers. The copyright infringement case, billed as the largest to date given that Megaupload in its heyday commanded around four percent of global online traffic, could set a precedent for internet liability laws and depending on its outcome, may force entertainment companies to rethink their distribution methods. A year on, the extradition hearing has been delayed until August, complicated by illegal arrest warrants and the New Zealand government's admission that it had illegally spied on Dotcom, who has residency status in the country. Last January, New Zealand's elite special tactics forces landed by helicopter at dawn in the grounds of Dotcom's mansion, worth roughly $16 million and featuring a servants' wing, hedge maze and life-size statues of giraffes and a rhinoceros, to arrest him and his colleagues at the request of the FBI. Police armed with semi-automatic weapons found Dotcom cowering alone in a panic room in the attic, while outside, a convoy of police cars and vans pulled up in the driveway. Around 70 officers took part in the raid. They left with computers, files and some of Dotcom's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Mercedes and a vintage pink Cadillac tricked with personalised licence plates screaming 'HACKER', 'EVIL', and 'MAFIA'. 'Every time you hear a helicopter, you automatically think, 'Oh, another raid', so it's something that stays with you for a long time,"" said Dotcom, who says he and his wife still panic when they hear sudden, loud noises in the house. Dotcom was coy about the details of the launch party as builders put the finishing touches to a festival-sized concert stage in the mansion's grounds, while two helicopters circled overhead. But if the impromptu, Willy Wonka-styled ice cream social he threw in Auckland earlier in the week is any indication, the party could be a more wholesome affair compared with the well-documented soirees of Dotcom's past, where nightclubs, hot tubs and scantily clad women were a common fixture. 'I had to grow up, you know, I was a big baby,' he said. 'Big baby with too much money usually leads to baby craziness. 'I am going to be more of a person that wants to help to make things better and help internet innovation to take off without all these restrictions by governments. That is going to be my primary goal if this business is successful.'","Dotcom is currently on bail following a raid on .

This time, Obama takes the oath of . office following a bruising presidential campaign and four years of . partisan fighting. He's more experienced in the ways of Washington.

For . at least the inauguration weekend, the fiscal fights and legislative . wrangling will be put aside in favor of pomp and circumstance. The .

The . president was still working on his inaugural address heading into the . weekend. He isn't expected to delve deeply into the policy objectives . he'll tackle in a second term, but the tone and theme of the speech will . set the stage for the policy fights to come.

Help: Volunteers are organizing service events in all 50 states for the day of service, which Obama created in 2009 . Aides said he will make the point that while the nation's political system doesn't require politicians to resolve all of their differences, it does require Washington to act on issues where there is common ground. He will speak about how the nation's core principles can still guide a country that has changed immensely since its founding. Temperatures were forecast to fall throughout the weekend and be in the 30s on Monday when the crowds gather along the parade route that will take Obama from Capitol Hill to the White House. Despite scaling back on some of the revelry, the inauguration will be a star-studded affair. Top acts including Beyonce, Katy Perry and Brad Paisley have signed on to perform at the weekend's events. The inauguration also is bringing thousands of Obama campaign staffers and donors to Washington, with many getting invitations for tours and other events at the White House. On Friday, the president and first lady held two private events for donors who helped finance his 2012 campaign.","President Barack Obama rolled up his sleeves to help paint bookshelves at the run-down Burrville Elementary School in Washington D.C.

Facebook users love to connect with old friends without having to meet them face-to-face, but one man has vowed to personally buck the trend by meeting and photographing all 788 of his friends—half of whom he’s never even met. Ty Morin believes our social media-driven society has weakened the bonds between individuals by making it too easy to brush off old friends or quickly connect without having real conversation. To change this, or at least demonstrate that there is an alternative, the Connecticut man has decided to personally meet each of his nearly 800 online pals. Scroll down for video . Lofty goal: Ty Morin (left) of Connecticut wants to meet and photograph all 788 of his Facebook friends doing what they love . What’s more, Morin intends to photograph each of the men and women who grace his Facebook feed while they do what they do best. Morin explains his intentions, which include a documentary film of the project dubbed ‘Friend Request: Accepted,’ on his Kickstarter campaign fundraising page. ‘The idea is to capture everyone doing something they are passionate about, while filming the whole process…I want to sit down with everyone and witness what gets their blood pumping.’ Morin writes. Old school: Morin (pictured) wants to film his quest and says it will stand in contrast to our cold online interactions, according to his Kickstarter page . Those passions include fighting fires and sculpting with fire, modern dance, and weight lifting, among many others. Interestingly, Morin freely admits ‘at least half of those 788 people, [he’s] never even spoken to.’ Nonetheless, Morin won’t be quickly snapping a few digital photos of his subjects. To parallel his analog approach to personal connection, the filmmaker/photographer will be snapping shots using an old-fashioned 8X10 camera. Diverse and dispersed: Morin's friends, like Toni Figuredo of Miami (pictured), are as geographically dispersed as their interests are diverse and he hasn't even met half of them . Arduous: Each of the 788 photos will be shot with an old 8X10 film camera, which takes about an hour and Morin aims to finish the project in 3 years . ‘The process of shooting with this camera is long and tedious,’ Morin writes. ‘It can be a pain in the ass sometimes, but it also allows me to spend time with these people. Each portrait takes about an hour to complete.’ So how long will a project that aims to photograph 788 geographically dispersed people, all doing what they love, take? ‘My plan,’ writes Morin, ‘is to take five new portraits every week…it will take approximately three years.’ Morin’s original fundraising goal for the filming, photographing, and travel expenses amounted to $5,000. Popular: Morin's goal to raise $5K has been met and more than doubled and his Facebook friends are adding up just as quickly . With nine days left to donate, 212 backers had pledged well over double that with an impressive $12,500. Even with the extra money, Morin’s goal is a lofty one. But he remains confident. ‘I'll roll with the punches,’ he promises donors, ‘making this my number one priority until it's Sundance material.’ Meanwhile, Morin’s Facebook friend count has risen right along with the popularity of his project. From 788, it has quickly risen to over 1,200.","Ty Morin's quest will take around three years .

A top independent school in Scotland is offering parents a mortgage-style payment scheme for their child's school fees. In a move to make private education more affordable, the Fernhill School in Glasgow has offered parents the chance to spread the cost of fees over ten years, interest free. Tony Boswell, a governor of the Catholic school, which charges £8976 a year for a senior school day pupil, said the new payment plan, thought to be the first of its kind in Scotland, could reduce monthly payments by up to 50 per cent. 'Innovative': Under the Fernhill scheme, parents can pay half the school fees every year and repay the outstanding amount after their child has left . He said: ‘We recognise that times are tough and we have been striving to develop a solution that helps families who may otherwise be unable to afford an independent education. ‘Fernhill's payment plan will be launched for the 2013/14 school year and allow parents whose children are joining this year to spread the cost of their fees over a longer term. ‘There is high demand from prospective parents for this kind of payment plan and, as this recession lengthens, we believe it is the right thing to do to ease the financial burden on those who want a private education.’ The average cost of private education is now more than £12,000 a year, with fees rising faster than the rate of inflation. Money troubles: The increase in school fees has put pressure on parents . The price of sending a child to an independent school in Scotland rose by 3.5 per cent in 2012/13 - with the highest fees topping £21,000. The increases put pressure on parents - particularly those for whom private education is at the limits of affordability. In February, the consumer price index, the Government's preferred measure of inflation, was running at 2.7 per cent, while the retail price index rose to 3.3 per cent in January. A report by the Bank of Scotland - published before the impact of the credit crunch - warned that members of key Scottish professions were already being priced out of sending their children to fee-paying schools, with teachers, engineers and police officers no longer able to afford a private education. More recently, the number of children attending private school in Scotland has fallen, with a drop of 1.5 per cent in both nursery and primary between 2010/11 and 2011/12. Under the Fernhill scheme, parents can pay half the school fees every year rather than the full amount and continue to repay the outstanding sums once their child has left. Other financial schemes available to parents in the sector include savings plans where money can be built up in advance of paying fees. In England, a number of finance companies offer to pay the fees in advance with parents repaying over a longer period time plus additional interest. A spokeswoman for the Scottish Council for Independent Schools described the scheme as ‘innovative’. She said: ‘Schools will be looking different ways to help parents and this is an innovative scheme that will help families mane the cost of a private education.'","Fernhill School in Glasgow is offering parents chance to spread fees over ten years, interest free .

The model did not complete military service after she married in 2007. She divorced soon afterwards. It is compulsory for women to do two years of service in the armed forces unless they have specific exemptions including being married or pregnant. Men have to complete three years of service from the age of 18. Refaeli has been chosen to feature in a series of adverts promoting technology and innovation in Israel. The Times of Israel reported that IDF Brigadier General Yoav Mordechai wrote to the Foreign Ministry to urge then to reconsider their choice. He said that it sets the wrong example to young Israeli's. He asked them to consider 'the negative message' being sent out by using the model as the country's 'representative'. Brig Gen. Mordechai was quoted in the Times of Israel as writing: 'In recent years, the IDF has been trying a variety of methods to improve the value of military service and to combat draft evasion, in order to preserve the moral dimension whereby the IDF if the people's army.'

After ten-year-old Gracie McNulty’s father died in an accident, she wasn’t sure how to cope with her first Christmas without him. So she decided to abandon the usual family festivities – and make her father’s last Christmas wish come true instead. With the help of her mother and three siblings, Gracie served turkey with all the trimmings to 50 homeless people yesterday. Generosity: Gracie McNulty, pictured, served Christmas dinner to 50 homeless people, helped by her mother and three siblings . Brace: Gracie's father Craig had promised to open the family's cafe to the homeless on Christmas day but died after falling from a roof. His daughter wanted to open the cafe to fulfill his wishes . Her father Craig, 38, was a regular charity volunteer who had served breakfast to the homeless on Boxing Day in the past, and  he had promised to open the  family’s cafe on Christmas Day this year. But Mr McNulty, a roofer, suffered serious head injuries when he fell while working. He was taken to hospital by air ambulance but died soon after the accident in August. Gracie’s mother Sharon McNulty, 46, who runs the Grilled and Filtered cafe in Dewsbury, West  Yorkshire, said: ‘After he died Gracie said to me “I don’t want  to have Christmas at home this year, I want to do what daddy wanted and open the cafe on Christmas Day. ‘It wouldn’t feel right to celebrate so we’re serving Christmas dinner to people who don’t have a home to go to.’ She added: ‘We’re all thinking of Craig. It’s all in his honour and he would be so happy with what we are doing. All smiles: The McNulty family with some of the homeless who were fed turkey dinners at the Grilled and Filtered cafe in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire . Helping out: Gracie was joined by her mother Sharon and three siblings: Kirstie, 19, Thomas, 21, and James, 26 . ‘It’s been absolutely fantastic, just to see their faces when they walked in. We’ve bought everybody thermal gloves, thermal scarves, and thermal socks and have also made sandwiches for them to take away.’ The family gave tickets for the Christmas dinner to local charities who help the homeless, and their community donated money to fund the event. Gracie was joined by her mother and three siblings – Kirstie, 19, Thomas, 21, and James, 26 – to serve up turkey dinners for three hours between 11.30am and 2.30pm. Gracie said: ‘It’s been the best Christmas ever. I was just at school feeling sad about my dad so decided I wanted to do something to make him proud and this felt like the perfect thing. People have been coming in calling me “super Grace.” I haven’t asked my mum yet but I want to do this every year.’ Fed and watered: Gracie described it as 'the best Christmas ever' and said she wanted to do something to make her late father proud . Miss McNulty and her partner were together for 15 years before his death. They never married, but he changed his surname so that the family shared a name. Miss McNulty, whose family have also raised £1,000 for the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, said: ‘Craig was the most generous, giving person you could ever meet. 'He was always doing something for somebody and worked for the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers, helping troubled youngsters achieve a trade. ‘He spent all his time making other people happy and hopefully we’ll be able to carry that on.’ Cafe: Grilled and Filtered in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire is run by Gracie's mother Sharon McNulty .","Gracie McNulty served 50 homeless diners at cafe in Dewsbury, Yorkshire .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:22 EST, 19 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:54 EST, 20 November 2012 . A Miami man is facing five years in prison and up to $10,000 fine for animal cruelty after allegedly beating a four-month old Beagle so severely that the puppy was dead just one day after he adopted her . Matthew Milewski, a high-frequency trader, adopted the puppy, Molly, from a Arkansas breeder Outback Beagles, who call their dogs 'friendly and loveable, with tail perpetually wagging!' But just one day after getting his new best friend, Milewski had allegedly whipped Molly with a leash, slammed her against hard surfaces, and drug her across parking lots until she was bleeding. Puppy: Molly the Beagle was only four months old when she was sent to Milewski last year. She was dead after just one day . American Airlines records show Milewski picked up Molly at 3:14 p.m. on Nov. 11, 2011. Inside the box there was a note from the breeder: 'I hope that she brings as much joy to you and your family as our dogs have brought us. I wish her a long life of happiness and contentment.' He later told police that he didn't care for her coat and considered returning 'it' but that he instead took her to the apartment he shared with his boyfriend and another beagle, Macy. He put an electric-shock collar and . leash on the new puppy the next day and began to walk her through the . building's parking lot. Carlos Gregorio, a valet parker in . the building, told police he he heard a 'loud scream from a dog' just as . he was bringing a car from the garage. At first he thought he'd hit an animal and jumped out of the vehicle. Man's best friend: Outback Beagles describes their dogs as friendly, easygoing, and constantly wagging their tails . Then he saw Milewski, 'striking his dog with leash.' Milewski was arrested in November 2011. He told police the dog likely died from injuries sustained when he dropped her in the shower. 'I don't think I did anything wrong, other than the outcome was very poor because of the way the dog landed,' he told investigators. 'This was 100 percent an accident.' Milewski's lawyer, David Macey, told the Miami Herald that 'there are some things that have not come to light yet.' 'You can't dispute there are injuries,' he said. 'How they occurred, whether or not it was a criminal act, is the question.' Macey is an expert in high-profile animal abuse cases, having represented 19-year-old Tyler Hayes Weinman when the teen was accused of killing 19 cats in South Miami-Dade in 2009. Prosecutors dropped the charges in that case after a defense expert determined that a large animal killed some of the cats, and Weinman is now suing several parties involved in the case. Discipline: Mathew Milewski claims he as only trying to discipline his new Beagle because dogs wouldn't become obedient with 'rainbows and sugarplums' Milewski denied the charges, claiming he was only trying to train the dog and following the instructions for the shock-collar manual. 'Dogs don't become extremely obedient with rainbows and sugarplums,' he said, admitting  that it may have appeared 'abusive' to onlookers who didn't know what he was doing, and that he'd been trying to train Molly in a 'very aggressive' way. Outback Beagles disagrees, noting on their website under training information that for Molly's particular breed: 'Praise is the key, as they thrive on positive attention.' Milewski told investigators he wanted to clean Molly after he noticed one of her paws was bleeding. 'When I went to put the dog underneath the shower head, it didn't like that at all and it bit me,' he said. 'I was very shocked. I don't like blood. When the dog bit me, a lot of blood came out and I overreacted to the dog doing this.' Exactly how he reacted is unclear. In one interview with investigators he describe it as having 'pushed' the dog in the shower, but in another he said he'd told the Alton Road Animal Hospital veterinarian that 'the way I threw the dog was definitely bad.' Milewski said he attempted to give the Molly first aid once she was on the shower floor. 'From there it was, I guess you can call it, unconscious, so I gave it CPR,' he said. 'I tried to stand the dog up. I blew in the dog. I covered its beak [sic], the dog’s belly puffed up. I thought it was going to blow up, then it s---.' Finally after calling a friend who advised him to take her to the vet, Milewski brought Molly to the Alton Road Animal Hospital. There Dr. Heidi Foster tried to stabilize Molly and keep her 'alive and comfortable,’ according to her police statement. Because the Alton Road X-ray machine was broken Milewski was directed to a clinic in Coral Gables. He put Molly in a pet carrier, belted it into the passenger seat of his BMW and left. Loveable: Though Milewski claimed he had to be rough with Molly to train her, the breeder's website said Beagles respond be to positive reinforcement . Mystery: Milewski's attorney David Macey argues that all the facts in the case haven't come out, and that Molly's injuries were not the product of abuse . Foster told police that when she last saw Molly the dog was unconscious but her heartbeat was strong and steady. '20 minutes late I got a call [from Milewski] that the dog's heart had stopped beating in the car,' Foster told police. 'I found it odd just due to the face that [Molly's] heart rate was so fast and strong and the vitals were fine.' Milewski came back with Molly's corpse. Foster put it in the freezer. The next day Charry called the police. Dr. Rosandra Manduca, a veterinary pathologist and adjunct professor at Miami Dade College, was recruited by Animal Services to perform a necropsy. She concluded death was 'likely due to a brain injury secondary to head trauma.' Molly's injuries pointed to having been shaken and slammed against a hard surface, and their was bruising around her mouth, indicating that she may have been smothered. Accusations are already being made that Milewski may have abused other animals. Stacey Laneve, assistant property manager in Milewski's apartment building, said that a month before Molly's death she saw his dog Macy shaking. 'I went closer and noticed hemorrhaging in her eyes,' she said. 'I freaked out. To me that's a bad sign.' Animal services has since confiscated Macy and returned her to her registered owner, Milewski's ex-boyfriend, who has not been named in police reports. Laneve said she sent Milewski a text message one day after Molly's death. 'It think there's more to this story,' she wrote. 'Do you think I'd kill a dog I just paid $1,300 for?' he allegedly responded. 'I would have sold it.'","Neighbors claim Matthew Milewski dragged the puppy across the parking lot until it was bleeding .

Two men in their mid-twenties and best friends since childhood died together on Saturday night after their boat capsized in rough conditions on the Great Salt Lake in Utah. The bodies of Logan Hardman, 25, of West Jordan and Chad Tohinaka, 25, of Sandy were pulled from the dark waters of the lake just before midnight on Saturday. Tohinaka was a student at Westminster College in Salt Lake City, while Hardman was a devoted family man who leaves behind a wife, Tasha, a three-year-old daughter Brynnlee and one-year-old son Brody. The best of friends: Chad Tohinaka and Logan Hardman tragically died when their boat capsized on the Great Salt Lake . Devoted family man: Logan Hardman leaves behind his wife Tasha, daughter Brynnlee and son Brody . Chad Tohinaka, 25, was a student at Westminster College in Salt Lake City . The two men, along with a 24-year-old friend, were heading back to shore from one of their regular duck hunting trips at about 4 p.m. on Saturday when the weather suddenly changed. Within seconds, waves flooded their boat, causing it to capsize and plunging all three men into the freezing 47-degree water. The 24-year-old man, whose name has not been released, swam about a half-mile to shore for help. Both Hardman and Tohinaka stayed with the boat, a 12 foot flat-bottomed vessel that the three men had recently purchased. The bodies were located approximately six miles east of the Great Salt Lake State Marina, where they had set sail from earlier that day. The Great Salt Lake is notorious for unpredictable conditions and on Saturday it experienced mild squall conditions, where periods of high wind would pass creating choppy two- to three-foot waves. Hardman and Tohinaka forged a lifetime’s friendship while still in diapers. Hardman’s mother acted as babysitter for the boys at her home in Kearns, where Tohinaka’s mother was a local school teacher who taught Hardman’s three older brothers. Logan Hardman was described as a calm and quiet person with an infectious smile, a passionate husband and father of two and a deeply religious man . Chad Tohinaka was best man at his friend Logan Hardman's wedding to his wife Tasha . Both Logan Hardman and Chad Tohinaka were avid duck hunting fans . ‘It was a wonderful friendship and, you . know, it was nice that they were not alone at the end,’ Tohinaka’s . mother, Karen Tohinaka, told The Salt Lake Tribune. Although they never lived in the same city, or attended the same schools the boys remained the best of friends throughout their lives. 'Logan and Chad have been inseparable since three year's old,' Matt Hardman, a brother of Logan, told Deseret News. 'They grew up that way and kept doing everything out of Jr. high and high school.' When Hardman married, Tohinaka was his best man. Tasha Hardman wrote on Tohinaka's Facebook page: 'Not only did I loose my husband and my kids lost their father but we also lost you a brother, great friend and my kids lost their uncle. 'Thank you for keeping my sweetheart company, it gives me comfort to know that you guys were together and not alone. You will truly be missed, we miss and love you very much. You were an amazing person!' Hardman was described by his family as a calm and quiet person with an infectious smile, a passionate husband and father of two, a deeply religious man and an avid duck hunter. Tragically, his life insurance policy was not scheduled to start until the new year. To assist his wife and children, an account has been established in Logan Hardman's name and individuals interested in donating can do so through Zion's Bank.

Appointed: John Witherow takes over as acting editor of the Times after 18 years at the helm of the Sunday Times . A new interim editor of The Times has been announced despite opposition from the newspaper's independent directors. John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times for the past 18 years, takes over from James Harding, who stood down last month. Mr Witherow is understood to have been the choice of Rupert Murdoch, chairman of The Times's parent company, who is thought to want to merge both titles in a seven-day operation. Such a move could mean waiving legal undertakings Mr Murdoch signed in 1981 to keep the titles separate. The deputy editor of the Sunday Times, Martin Ivens, has been made its acting editor. Mr Witherow, 60 tomorrow,  will start at The Times immediately subject to formal approval by The Times independent directors, said News International chief executive Mike Darcey said in a statement . He added: 'Following a meeting of the independent national directors yesterday we welcome their clear understanding of the very difficult financial position of our newspapers and therefore the need to address the undertakings given in 1981. 'A thorough assessment of the undertakings will enable them to make recommendations to us and to government as to how the newspapers can be structured in order to reduce their costs and become economically viable. 'However, during this interim period of continued consultation over the undertakings, we still have a responsibility to provide these two newspapers and their journalists with strong and stable leadership.' Backing: Corporation chief Rupert Murdoch with new Times acting editor John Witherow . Mr Harding left his post last month. He said it had been made clear to him that the publishers wanted to . appoint a new editor. Mr Witherow was seen as the favourite to succeed him, but the reshuffle . has been delayed amid rows over the possible merger of the two . titles. Talks between News International and the paper's independent directors are now effectively at a stand-off, according to the BBC.

The horrific ordeal of a factory worker who suffered . life-changing injuries after being dragged into a conveyor belt has been revealed in the statement she gave to a court hearing over the accident. Kelly Nield recalled how she was 'coughing up blood' as she felt herself pulled into the mechanism - but the factory floor was so busy that nobody noticed the accident. After being rushed to hospital, she feared her injuries would prove fatal, and asked doctors, ""Am I going to die?"".' Mainetti UK, the company which owned the factory on Deeside in North Wales, was yesterday fined over the incident, which left Miss Nield spending three months in hospital. Kelly Nield's hair can be seen tangled in the machine at Ellesmere Port . Injuries: Kelly Nield had her hair ripped out while working at a factory; she is pictured before the accident . The firm was forced to pay out £60,000 and meet costs of £21,600 after being faced with four charges brought by the Health and Safety Executive relating to the 'horrific accident' which took place in April 2009. In a statement, Miss Nield, now 24, revealed the full horror of the incident. 'I was in total shock so I couldn't feel much pain to begin with but I was panic-stricken,' she said. 'I knew I was in trouble. I started banging on the belt and shouting for help.' 'I was coughing up blood and thinking, ""Oh my god, oh my god."" It all happened so fast. I could see my finger dangling there and I couldn't breathe, but the factory was noisy and nobody had seen it happen. 'Then my friend spotted me and ran to press the main off button, but as I watched her it felt like it all happened in slow motion. A workman raced over and found some scissors to cut the scarf but my throat immediately began to swell up and I couldn't speak. 'I was very gurgly and I could hardly breathe. I remember feeling very weak and wanting to sleep. Later I kept asking doctors, ""Am I going to die?""' Factory: Miss Nield was working at the Mainetti facility on Deeside in North Wales, pictured . Miss Nield was working at the coat hanger factory for £7 an hour when she leaned forward to free some hangers which were caught in the machinery. Her scarf became entangled in the cogs of a conveyor belt, which then dragged in her hair. As she tried to free herself her hand was caught in the machine, trapping her little finger and almost severing it. After the accident she sustained serious injuries to the neck and throat, lost much of her hair and fractured her finger. Miss Nield was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital, where she remained for three months while undergoing a series of operations. She now has disabling injuries and has been fitted with a stomach peg to feed her liquids because she is unable to swallow, as well as suffering from flashbacks and trauma, prosecutor Simon Parrington told Mold Crown Court. Responsible: Mainetti UK has admitted its culpability for the horrific incident in 2009 . Culpable: Representatives of Mainetti, pictured, admitted their responsibility for Miss Nield's injuries . Judge Niclas Parry said . that it was 'an accident waiting to happen', adding that Miss Nield's . horrific injuries were entirely foreseeable due to Mainetti's lax safety . standards. Mr Parrington . said that the company failed to provide proper instruction, prevent . access to dangerous parts of the machinery or install an emergency stop . button on the factory floor. Miss . Nield, an agency worker, had watched a 15-minute training DVD, but was . not warned about the dangers of working with conveyors before she . started doing so. Her accident came on the first day she worked on the conveyor line, when she 'had to rely on her fellow workers to show her what to do', according to Mr Parrington. Simon Antrobus, defending, said that the company officials wished to apologise to Miss Nield and added that the firm accepted full responsibility for her ordeal. 'It does not seek to evade responsibility or pass the buck,' he said. He claimed the accident was a result of workers failing to follow the company's own safety procedures, but admitted that managers should have rectified this failure. Mr Antrobus added that Mainetti had a good safety record and had recently moved to a new factory in North Wales with updated procedures. He also pointed to the company's charity work and good reputation among its own employees as mitigation.","Kelly Nield was dragged into machinery at factory in North Wales in 2009 .

Cheap and nasty food from around the world is being dressed up as high quality and pushed out through high street stores and restaurants. Honey, cheese, eggs, organic meat and produce, Basmati rice, even fish and chips are not necessarily what they seem. Just before Christmas one British firm was fined more than £20,000 for passing off a cheap pesto sauce as something far more gourmet. The naked truth: Stark Naked Foods passed off cheaper pesto sauces as something far more gourmet . Stark Naked Foods claimed its pesto was made with extra virgin olive oil and Grana Padano cheese, when in fact it was sunflower oil and a cheaper Latvian cheese. At the same time,  pubs and restaurants are not immune to boasting of offering local quality food, when this actually means the nearest supermarket or wholesaler. One estimate suggests British families are wasting as much as £7billion a year paying over the odds for food that has been faked in some way.. There are cases of imported beef from Zebu cattle, which have a distinctive hump on their neck, being imported from south America and sold in pubs as 'British'. Meat from cross-breed cattle containing Zebu genes from Brazil is cheaper than British beef, however critics point out that it can also be much tougher. Vast quantities of cheap honey is being imported into Europe from China and used to bulk up other types in a scam that has become known as 'honey- laundering'. Beefed up: Imported meat from South American Zebu cattle has been sold in UK pubs as 'British' In some cases honey is not honey at all, but rather corn syrup or just sugar. Butcher shops and leading restaurants . have been found selling conventional meat and produce as organic, along . with a premium price. In the past, even Harrods has been found selling farmed salmon as wild. But the fakery does not stop at salmon, for some fish and chip shops have been prosecuted for passing off Shark Catfish, which is farmed in the rivers of Vietnam's Mekong delta, as battered cod. The fish sells for less than half the . price of real cod in wholesale markets, however chip shop customers are . being charged as if it is the real thing. 2011: Gourmet pesto sauce sold by Stark Naked Foods was supposed to contain extra virgin olive oil and Grana Padano cheese. In fact it was sunflower oil and a cheaper Latvian cheese. The firm was fined £23,500 . 2010: Egg packer jailed after making at least £3million by passing off foreign battery cage eggs as free range.

The steaks were imported from Brazil. 2007: Mitchells & Butler group, which owns Vintage Inns, O’Neills, All Bar One and Browns. prosecuted for food fraud. A buffalo mozzarella turned out to be full-fat cow’s cheese;  Gloucestershire ham came from Bedfordshire farms; Irish Wexford cheese was a run of the mill mature cheddar.

Director of policy at the Trading Standards Institute, Andy Foster, warned that a squeeze on spending means his members find it increasingly difficult to stem the problem. He said: 'Food fraud has been an issue that dates back more than 100 years. There are numerous examples. Caught: Even upmarket Harrods in London has been found selling farmed salmon as wild in the past . 'Things like extending – bulking up – meat products with other species is common in catering. We have known this with certain types of take-away food and fish, for example. 'Where there is a price differential there is always a temptation for a more unscrupulous manufacturer to make a switch and try and get away with it.' Mr Foster said: 'Wherever there is a few pounds to be made someone will try to exploit it. 'In times of recession, when people are looking for a bargain and going to different places, that is where you start to find more fraud introduced to food.' Policing of food companies and restaurants is the job of trading standards officers, however spending on these services and number of people on the ground has been cut sharply in the last two years. Mr Foster said: 'With the limited resources that trading standards have, which is diminishing year on year, they are less able to carry out the more routine sampling we would normally do.'","British families are wasting £7 billion a year on food that has been faked .

Two slaughtermen have been sacked after an undercover investigation exposed shocking cruelty to horses at an abattoir. The disturbing video shows them being beaten with metal poles and illegally stunned in groups of up to three at a time before being killed. In one horrifying moment a stunned horse appears to regain consciousness, only to find itself hanging upside down and about to have its throat cut. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A horse hangs upside down in the abattoir before it is about to be bled . The animal appears to wake up and begins to move its head . Two slaughtermen have had their licences revoked by the Food Standards Agency following the probe . The footage was captured at the Red Lion Abattoir, near Nantwich, Cheshire, after an eight-week investigation by animal welfare group Hillside. They also saw horses which appeared to be sick or injured and hadn't been immediately put down. Founder Wendy Valentine, 63, told MailOnline: 'We have rescued around 700 horses and we were concerned about where we were saving them from.' 'It's unbelievably depressing there. They shouldn't be stunned or shot in front of each other like that. 'It's total disrespect for animal welfare.' The scandal emerged as several British supermarkets have been exposed as selling frozen beef burgers which contain horse meat. The alert was first raised by Irish . food watchdogs after horse DNA was found in burgers sold through Tesco, . Iceland, Aldi, Lidl and Dunnes in Ireland. It subsequently emerged that burgers from the same batches were sold in the British outlets of both Tesco and Iceland. Incredibly, the beef content in one Everyday Value burger sold by Tesco was actually 29 per cent horse meat. The horses at the Red Lion Abattoir are believed to be butchered for European food markets. Three horses are crammed into a pen alongside each other before being stunned . Under animal welfare laws horses are not supposed to be stunned or slaughtered in front of each other because it causes severe distress . A slaughterman is shown beating the horses with a metal pole as they are shunted through the abattoir . Animal welfare group Hillside carried out the investigation at the Red Lion Abattoir over eight weeks . Under the Welfare of Animals Act 1995, horses cannot be slaughtered in sight of another horse as it causes severe distress to the animal. The footage, which has been uploaded to YouTube, shows three horses crammed into a tiny pen before being stunned. The Food Standards Agency told the Daily Mirror it has revoked the licences of two slaughtermen after a probe into the video. FSA head of approvals Craig Kirby said: 'As soon as we got the footage and reviewed it we took immediate action to revoke the slaughtermen's licences. 'We will also look to gather further evidence to see if we can prosecute.' The Red Lion Abattoir told Sky News it views animal welfare and public health with paramount importance. In a statement it said: 'In attendance at the The Red Lion Abattoir are three full time Food Standards Officers comprising of an official veterinarian and full-time meat hygiene inspectors throughout production.' It said the incidents were 'not the norm, but of an isolated nature' and they have taken disciplinary action against the individual featured. The statement continued: 'I agree horses should individually enter the stunning area and most certainly not three at a time. 'However, small horses and ponies having spent years together as companions are difficult to separate. Horse lovers would understand that. 'My opinion and that of other veterinarians is it is better to keep those types together to reduce the stress, providing swift dispatch is achieved.' An RSPCA spokesperson said the organisation is viewing the footage and will decide whether to prosecute. In a statement it said: 'The footage is shocking and upsetting to watch. With the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 in mind, we have concerns that horses appear to be in the stunning pen at the same time rather than individually as the law requires. 'We also have concerns about some of the animals that appear to be injured. We have requested a copy of the unedited footage with a view to investigating.' The RSPCA said it is viewing the footage and will then decide whether it has a case to prosecute . There were also some concerns that horses were ill or injured at the abattoir and hadn't been immediately put down . An RSPCA spokesperson described the footage as 'shocking and upsetting' Former government chief veterinary officer Keith Meldrum, who viewed the footage, has told Sky News he was shocked by the 'appalling' breaches of animal welfare. 'We see three animals stunned at the same time and it is totally illegal and contrary to welfare slaughter regulations,' he said. 'It's a significant welfare problem for a number of reasons. It's harder to render them unconscious in a group and they have a higher chance of regaining consciousness before you've completed the procedure.' Roly Owers, chief executive of World Horse Welfare, said: 'The breaches, from what we've seen, are throughout; from the care of the animals to the slaughter process. 'Horses are intelligent animals. When they see an animal stunned in front of them you can only imagine the distress that animal is going through. There are, without doubt, welfare issues here and it is plain illegal.'","Disturbing video filmed at Red Lion Abattoir near Nantwich, Cheshire .

As snow settles across the country today four million households will feel an extra chill as a price hike from supplier E.ON kicks in. E.ON’s nine per cent energy tariff increase adds around £110 a year to bills – bringing the average annual gas and electricity cost up to £1,370 for its customers. It is the last of the 'big six' suppliers to raise prices this winter. The hikes of 7.7 per cent to electricity charges and 9.4 per cent to gas charges were announced more than a month ago but will come as a blow to householders turning up thermostats to battle sub-zero temperatures across the UK. Scroll down for video . Terrible timing: As millions of households turn up their thermostats to battle sub-zero temperatures across the UK, E.ON has introduced a nine per cent energy tariff . Frozen: A woman walks her dog past a snow covered thatched cottage in North Yorkshire yesterday . Additional heating in the freezing temperatures is already expected to add up to £7 a week to bills, warned experts earlier this week, and that's before higher prices are taken into account. It costs £3 a day, on average, to heat a home, but during cold weather this can easily rise by £1 a day as people push up thermostats or leave the heating on for longer, according to figures from price comparison website, uSwitch.com. E.ON announced its price rise last month . following similar confirmations from rivals SSE, British Gas, npower, . Scottish Power and EDF. Having pledged in May to keep residential energy prices on hold during 2012, E.ON blamed the new year hikes on increased costs, including the price of energy on the wholesale market and regulatory costs. Comparison website Confused.com said that the recent increases have widened the gap between the cheapest tariffs on the market and the standard deals being offered by the big six companies to more than £300 a year. Two years ago, customers on standard dual fuel tariffs were paying up to 23 per cent or £221 a year more than those on the cheapest deals, but the latest round of hikes has increased the price gap to almost a third (30 per cent) or £312, the website said. The energy price gap was calculated by working out the cost for an average dual fuel user if they were on the cheapest tariff on the market and paying by monthly direct debit. Life goes on: People in Queens Square, Bristol, attempt to go about their day as usual despite the severe weather and freezing temperatures . Last week experts warned consumers that small energy firms, such as First Utility and Co-operative Energy has some of the cheapest tariffs on the market and should not be ignored in favour of the big six energy firms. Yesterday, one of the big energy suppliers, SSE, fought back by launching new variable energy tariff pushing its way to the top of the best buy table. It’s Discount Energy Bonus April 2015, costs £1,134 a year, making it £16 cheaper than First Utility’s iSave v14 at £1,150 a year. The new plan is nearly £50 cheaper than the cheapest big six plan, EDF Energy’s Blue + Price Promise, costing £1,182 a year. However, this is a fixed price plan offering protection on costs until the end of June 2014, whereas the plan from SSE is variable. Best buy energy plans: SSE's new tariff pushes it to the top of the table with small suppliers, First Utility and Co-operative Energy snapping at its heels. According to research by MoneySupermarket.com, households typically use around 40 per cent of their annual energy consumption during the winter months, pushing the next quarterly bill for many households above £500. The comparison website also conducted new research that showed large regional differences in the money that can be saved by switching. It found that people living in the South East could potentially make the biggest savings. People living in the South East who have never switched could save £385 by moving from their traditional energy supplier to the cheapest deal. Bill payers in North Wales and Liverpool who are still customers of their original energy supplier were found to have the highest typical annual bills of £1,444 for their gas and electricity and they could save around £306 by switching, MoneySupermarket found. Soaring energy prices have been a major driver of inflation which has squeezed households in recent months. Pushing through: A cyclist uses a snow covered cycle path in Bristol, as snow shut roads and disrupted train travel today . The Fuel Poverty Advisory Group (FPAG) recently estimated that 300,000 more homes were pushed into fuel poverty over Christmas, meaning these families are spending more than 10 per cent of their incomes on keeping their homes warm. The increases and freezing temperatures have put an even greater emphasis on households to switch energy suppliers and seek out the best deals. Kate Rose, head of energy at Confused.com, said: 'There are still many households who have never switched supplier and could therefore be paying over £300 a year more, which is a staggering 30 per cent more than people that have shopped around or switched to one of the cheapest tariffs on the market. 'With temperatures dropping, increasing energy prices continue to be a significant worry to millions of households.'","E.ON's 9% energy tariff brings annual gas and electricity cost to £1,370 .

He is also likely to write a blog about the network and possibly even write fiction inspired by the output, according to The Guardian. Earlier this week Miss Williams outlined her plans for Radio 4 in 2013 admitting that she wanted to add more spice to the content. Miss Williams said: ‘I want to shift the focus this year in part to Radio 4’s cultural heart. 'I want to open up the airwaves and invite artists to bring their talents to Radio 4. 'At a time when political and economic ideas often seem in reference to the past, what does culture have to say about the way we live now?

Three teenagers who had left a school function early were killed on Thursday when their pickup trucks collided at a rural intersection in southeastern Indiana, police and school officials said. The two-vehicle crash involved six students from South Ripley High School in the small town of Versailles, about 45 miles west of Cincinnati. The students had the day off of school to attend a Future Farmers of America event at a rural church, but they left the daylong event around 9:30 a.m. after serving breakfast to local agriculture officials, Superintendent Rob Moorhead said. Samantha Hansen, 18 (left) was tragically killed in the lethal smash today that killed two other teenagers and injured three others including Kayla Adkinson, 15 ( center right image) Caleb Cumberworth, 15, (left) suffered minor hand injuries in the crash and Thomas Crawford, 17, (right) was taken to hospital with a chest injury .

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:56 EST, 5 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:15 EST, 5 March 2013 . Volvo has launched a revolutionary safety device that scans for cyclists and automatically brakes if a collision is imminent. The Swedish car firm says the camera and radar-guided technology, which is being introduced into cars from May, could save  hundreds of lives. The system comprises a radar scanner in the grille, a camera fitted in front of the rear-view mirror, and an onboard computer. It allows the car to identify cyclists who swerve into its path and reacts by slamming on the brakes. Scroll down for video . How it works: The camera and radar combine to identify and differentiate between pedestrians and cyclists . Radar: Computers calculate any possible collision and - if the driver ignores initial warnings - apply the brakes . The driver is given a loud audible warning and a visible warning of a row of red lights flashing up on the windscreen. This is how Volvo's amazing new technology works: . The new cyclist detector system comprises a radar scanner set into the car’s grille, a camera fitted in front of the rear-view mirror, and a computerised central control unit. The radar measures the distance to any suspicious object while the camera compares its shape and size against an electronic visual catalogue of thousands of images – including bicycles and cyclists. It can even differentiate between a pedal cyclist and a motor cyclist. Volvo spokesman Duncan Forrester said: ’The high-resolution camera makes it possible to spot the moving pattern of pedestrians and cyclists. ‘The radar scans the area in front of the car. Once it has detected an object, the camera confirms that it is a vehicle, a bicycle or a pedestrian and it ""keeps an eye"" on the object. ‘If the situation becomes critical and in collision-course with the object a red warning flashes in the windscreen and the car activates full braking power automatically.’ The system is called ‘Cyclist Detection with full auto brake’ – but has already been dubbed ’cycle scan’ - and was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in Switzerland today. Danger: Should a cyclist suddenly swerve, warning lights flash up on the windscreen (shown on the left) Detection: Pedestrians, cyclists and parked vehicles are all recognisable to the car because it compares them to thousands of images stored on its computer hard-drive . Doug Speck, senior vice president of marketing, sales and customer service at Volvo Car Group, said it was ‘a major advance’ in road safety. All Volvo cars equipped with pedestrian detection will now also be fitted with cyclist detection, he said. Volvo cited accident data showing that around half of all cyclists killed in European traffic have collided with a car – a situation which the firm’s new technology aims to counter-act. Volvo, which sold 40,000 new cars in the UK last year, said it will be available ’from Mid May in 2013’ in the Volvo V40, S60, V60, XC60, V70, XC70 and S80 models as part of a more general ‘driver support’ safety package costing £800. A Volvo spokesman said the system was designed to deal with scenarios such as ‘a cyclist in the same lane swerving out in front of the car’, someone wobbling and not paying attention, or taking evasive action to avoid a pot-hole. Safety: The package will be available in models including the V60 from May . Volvo stressed that the automatic brakes kick in only ‘as a last resort’ and that the driver otherwise retains ultimate control of the car and brakes. Deaths and serious injuries among cyclists, children and pedestrians have soared on Britain’s roads amid a summer of sporting spectaculars, school holidays and unseasonal wet weather. Road safety experts say the Olympics and a ‘Bradley Wiggins’ effect may have contributed to an alarming rise in child pedestrian and cyclist casualties last summer as youngsters sought to emulate their sporting heroes. Last year, 122 cyclists were killed on British roads - the highest toll for five years. Previous studies have found that the number of cyclists killed rises during recessions as more people take to their bikes to save money on running a car.","Gadget warns drivers and applies brakes if the motorist fails to take action .

Top Gear has sparked a major row in New Zealand after authorities were forced to apologise to Maoris for letting the show film a high-speed stunt on a 'spiritual' beach. Staff from the BBC's flagship motoring show are set to descend on Ninety Mile Beach next week to record a 150kmh scene for the programme, which is fronted by Jeremy Clarkson. The move has led to an outcry by Maori peoples after the broadcaster was granted special permission to use the beach - also known as Te Oneroa-a-Tohe - at short notice. Sacred: An aerial view of Ahipara Beach, part of Ninety Mile Beach, Northland, North Island, New Zealand, where the Top Gear team plan to film . The filming schedule means a 50km stretch of the beach, which is also classed as a public road with a speed limit of 100kph, could be closed for several hours a day for up to a week. It has not yet been revealed whether Clarkson, 52, or fellow presenters James May or Richard Hammond will be getting behind the wheel of the speeding car, which will be followed by a chase car to record the action. The sprawling beach, in Northland on New Zealand's north island, is used by Maoris for food gathering and recreations as well as for spiritual reasons. A spokesman for Far North District Council said the BBC had been granted special dispensation to film the stunt, along with other pieces for future episodes, on the beach between March 11 and March 17. The council had to grant permission . for the closure without going through its normal process - advertising . the proposals and allowing two weeks for public submissions - because . the request came in just 14 days before the beach needed to be closed. Five . Maori iwi (peoples) - Te Rarawa, Te Aupouri, Ngai Takoto, Ngati Kuri, . and Ngati Kahu - have custodianship of the beach but the council only . approached Ngati Kuri for permission to grant the road closure outside . the normal process. Controversial: Top Gear with Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May . Down Under: (Left to right) Presenters Jeremy Clarkson and James May attend the Top Gear Live photo call in Sydney, Australia . The . council spokesman apologised to the iwi for the lack of consultation, . adding that the beach would only be closed in short stretches for just . five minutes at a time during the high-speed scenes. Other stretches of the beach would be shut down for up to 45 minutes at a time on two of the other days of filming, he added. 'The . council has apologised (to the other iwi) that we didn't take the . consultation far enough and we will be taking steps to ensure . appropriate consultation is done in the future,' the spokesman said. Top Gear is one of the BBC's most successful programmes, but has run into plenty of controversy along the way. In November 2008 he made a joke about . how tough it is to change gear in a lorry - and linked it to the . Suffolk Strangler Stephen Wright, who murdered sex workers in Ipswich. Going around the world: The Stig (back), Richard Hammond (left) James May (centre) and Jeremy Clarkson of Top Gear . Clarkson said: 'Change gear, change gear, change gear, check mirror, murder a prostitute, change gear, change gear, murder. That's a lot of effort in a day.' In February 2009, Clarkson famously called then-prime minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot'. A year later he illustrated dangerous driving conditions with a joke about a woman in a burka wearing a red G-string, which was branded 'distasteful'. Spin doctor Alastair Campbell revealed on his blog in the same month that in an un-aired comment Clarkson was asked by him about gay rights and he replied, 'I demand the right not to be bummed.' In other gaffes he compared a Ferrari to a person with special needs, called Mexicans 'lazy', 'feckless' and 'flatulent', said long queues at airport control could be solved by 'a bit of racism' and was caught parking in a disabled driver bay while filming - receiving large numbers of complaints. Earlier this year he compared a Japanese car to the Elephant Man and people with 'growths on their faces'. The BBC Trust's editorial standards committee this week gave him another slap on the wrist for the scripted remarks, ruling that he had 'strayed into an offensive stereotypical assumption'. Probably his most shocking moment came on The One Show, where he said that striking public sector workers 'should be shot in front of their families'. Clarkson was forced to apologise and the regulator launched an investigation after his remark sparked around 31,700 complaints. He was later cleared.","BBC's motoring show set to descend on Ninety Mile Beach next week .

'Now they have removed everything from me and I can also walk a little bit and I can talk and I'm feeling better and it doesn't seem like I had a big operation. 'I think everything is fine, it's better. I think it will just get better very soon and there will be no problem. My mission is the same to help people and I will do that. 'If I try to speak about my whole treatment, it started in Pakistan and they did a very successful and a very good operation. 'And God gave me new life because of the prayers of people and the talent of doctors. 'Here in Birmingham they did the operation of my nerves so after four or five months the left side of my face was working. 'They took a lot of care of me and I think I'm really inspired from the doctors and nurses, they are like my mother and father. I will get fully recovered very soon.' Brave: Malala Yousafzai speaks for the first time since being shot in the head by the Taliban for protesting . Determined: The 15-year-old, who had surgery in the UK, said she wanted every child to be educated . The inspirational videos were released by bosses at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, which treats soldiers shot or blown up on the battle field. The schoolgirl escaped death by a matter of inches when she was shot on October 9 last year - as the bullet entered just above her left eye and ran along her jaw, 'grazing her brain'. Doctors in Pakistan removed the bullet before Malala was flown to the UK, where she is likely to secure permanent residence. Her father Ziauddin was given the job of education attache at the Pakistani consulate in Brimingham earlier this year. Malala had been readmitted for the surgery after leaving the hospital to recuperate with father Ziauddin, 42, mother Toorpekai, 40, and brothers Khushal, 12, and eight-year-old Atul, at a safe house in the West Midlands. Recovery: Malala's surgery has been described by a Queen Elizabeth Hospital spokeswoman as a success . Faith: The teenager said she is 'getting better day by day' thanks to the prayers of all people . A hospital spokeswoman said the operation was a 'success', and added: 'Her condition is described as stable and her medical team are very pleased with the progress she has made so far. She is awake and talking to staff and her family.' He said she was aware of her high profile and Taliban threats to her, but added: 'She's determined to speak for her cause.' The new Malala Fund has been set up to support the determined teenager's long-running efforts for children's right to education across the world. The fund has been established by non-governmental organisation Vital Voices. Alyse Nelson, Vital Voices President and CEO said: 'We stand with Malala and girls around the globe who are boldly speaking out as advocates for education and equality. 'When girls move forward, they take their communities forward too.' Video: Malala speaks before and after her surgery .","15-year-old Malala Yousafzi said God has given her a new life .

Would-be killer: UCF student James Oliver Seevakumaran was planning a campus killing spree before killing himself, cops said today . A University of Central Florida student who committed suicide in his campus dorm room last night was plotting to kill classmates with improvised explosives and an assault rifle, cops said today. James Oliver Seevakumaran, was found dead in his bedroom. Along with his body, police also found about 200 rounds of ammunition, two guns - one a tactical assault rifle - and a backpack filled with four IEDs. They also found writings detailing an elaborate plan to conduct an attack. Police believe that Seevakumaran had pulled the fire alarm to get students out of their rooms and into the open. Hundreds of students were evacuated from the dorm on the Orlando campus after the fire alarm was pulled at about 12:21am, UCF Police Chief Richard Beary told reporters during a press conference this evening. While they were on their way to the scene, a 911 call came in about a man with a gun. The caller was Seevakumaran's roommate, who told police that came into the room and pointed a gun at him. Beary said that the responding officers may have caught Seevakumaran off guard, and he killed himself before putting his plan into action. Scroll down for video .

He added that Seevakumaran had not yet paid his school fees for this semester, and a process had begun to kick him out of the dorm. He had no prior disciplinary record at UCF, but he was arrested in 2006 for misuse of a temporary tag and driving with a suspended license. His writings indicated that he had been planning the attack since February, and had bought his weapons in an Orlando-area gunshop.

Just after noon today, the explosives were removed from the dorm and classes resumed as scheduled. The sheriff's bomb squad was examining the explosive devises this morning. About 500 students were evacuated from the dorm and an adjacent parking garage was closed. Both facilities have since reopened. The school utilized text message alerts to keep students informed about the situation. Scare: Students were evacuated from the tower and moved to an open area about 1,000 feet from the UCF Arena . Antonio Whitehead, 21, a junior from . Hollywood, Florida, said he heard the fire alarm go off after midnight . and thought it was a routine alarm. He headed outside where he saw a crowd already heading across the street from the dorm. 'All . of a sudden, I felt the crowd move a little faster. And a police . officer with a machine gun or something told everyone to start moving a . lot faster,' he said. Whitehead, who has lived in the dorm . for two years, said the students were moved to an open area about 1,000 . feet from UCF Arena. Grant . Hernandez, 20, a sophomore from Orlando who also is a resident at the . dorm, said he woke up sometime after midnight when police were . evacuating the building. 'We weren't allowed to get our cars.

When it comes to home furnishings there aren't many things more stylish than an authentic Persian rug but savvy shoppers won't be able to pick up this magic carpet in a holiday bazaar. The ancient rug, which dates back to the 1650s is estimated to sell for an incredible £5m when it goes on sale at auction this summer. The exquisite handwoven carpet is more than 360 years old and measures 8ft 9ins by 6ft 5ins, and the pre-sale estimate from the auction house means it works out as a a hefty £92,592 per square foot. Tidy pile: This ancient Persian rug, which dates back to the 1650s, is set to reach an incredible £5m when it goes up for sale at Sotheby's in New York . The intricately woven rug of red, blue and green colours was owned by an American billionaire  industrialist who bought it in the early 1900s, and the artifact was donated to a museum after his death in 1925. Since then the carpet, decorated with an asymmetrical pattern of sickle-shaped leaves, has been regularly displayed at the Corcoran Museum in the US capital, Washington DC. However, the museum has now decided to sell the rug to raise funds and its auction later this year is generating huge excitement among antique carpet collectors across the world. Despite its age, the rug is said to be in exceptional condition, suggesting it had been hung for many years rather than being laid on a floor. Mary Jo Otsea, a senior consultant of rugs and carpets at auctioneers Sotheby's, said: 'This is a beautiful example of carpet weaving.

Town hall officials have quizzed residents about their sexuality – in a survey on wheelie bins. The questionnaire, sent by Birmingham council to thousands of homes, posed a number of mundane questions relating to recycling reward schemes, the sizes of bins and whether respective properties had adequate space to store them. But it had a bizarre sting in the tail. One of the questions in the ‘about you’ section asked: ‘Which of the following most accurately describes your sexual orientation?’ 'Mind your own business': Residents were asked about their sexuality in a questionnaire on rubbish disposal . Irrelevant: The question appeared in Birmingham City Council's survey on its wheelie bin scheme . The options available were ‘bisexual, gay man, gay woman/lesbian, heterosexual/straight, other, or prefer not to say’. The question has not gone down well . with the citizens of Birmingham. One of them, Dave Dixon, 34, who was . emailed the questionnaire, said: ‘It does not ask if residents want such . bins but is very interested in their sexual orientation. Are we going . to have different coloured bins dependent on one’s orientation?’ Cyril Mayers, 40, added: ‘What the . hell has sexual orientation or religion got to do with wheelie bins? Mind your own business.’ The council responded by claiming . that the question is one of the standard monitoring exercises to ensure . the responses represent a cross-section of the city’s population. Wheelie bins: Homeowners questioned what their sexual orientation had to do with their views on recycling . Communities . Secretary Eric Pickles today accused the council of ignoring repeated . reminders from his department, as well as statutory guidance, by asking . residents to fill out 'intrusive' questionnaires. The question appeared in an 'about . you' section at the end of the form e-mailed out to residents, and said: . 'Which of the following most accurately describes your sexual . orientation?' Respondents . were invited to select from 'bisexual, gay man, gay woman/lesbian, . heterosexual/straight, other, or prefer not to say'. Former Tory councillor Peter Smallbone said: 'The survey doesn't ask whether you want one [a wheelie bin], but does ask about sexual orientation. 'It's typical pointless lefty nonsense,' he said. Resident Paul Stanley asked: 'Why do I need to answer questions about sexual orientation/ethnicity/religion when responding to a survey about wheelie bins?'. Gaffe: Birmingham City Council said the question was included in the survey to ensure responses reflected a cross-section of the city's population . A spokesman said: 'Although we do ask those questions, as part of the effort to make the feedback as informed as possible, you will have also noticed that 'prefer not to say' is an option to every question in that part of the survey.' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said today: 'We've repeatedly written to councils . to remind them that local residents shouldn’t be asked to fill out . intrusive questionnaires about their sexuality, religion and other . personal details just because they’ve enquired about getting their bins . emptied or joining a local library. 'Birmingham Council have repeatedly ignored this advice despite . statutory guidance from DCLG which states that this is simply not necessary. 'At a time when taxpayers are watching their pennies this is just one . indication of how Labour run councils like Birmingham are showing a . complete disregard for taxpayers' money.  Clamping down on sending out . these unnecessary documents will not only save taxpayers’ money but . protect the privacy of residents of all backgrounds.' Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'This is yet another example of how bureaucracy and box-ticking have become all too commonplace in town halls. 'Councils must focus on providing the best value for taxpayers’ money instead of wasting their time and local residents asking irrelevant questions.'

A father whose daughter was abducted by her own mother ten years ago has made a film in a desperate bid to track her down. Reya Lunetta was kidnapped aged two, by her mother Camilla Ellefsen amid a fraught custody battle with Reya's American father Brozzi Lunetta in 2002. Mr Lunetta, a director, spent more than a decade looking for Reya and has now made a film about his search in the hope that she will be able to find him. The film, entitled Reya, is described by Mr Lunetta as 'a fictional film with moments of undeniable truth' and uses some of Mr Lunetta's home videos of Ellefsen in L.A. 11 years ago. He says that the 'common goal' of those working on the movie, which will be screened for the first time in Stockholm in April, is 'to find Reya by reaching . out to as many as possible with this film.' Actors such as Yohanna Idha, . who won best actress at the Stockholm International Film Festival in . 2011, have worked on the film for free. The plot follows the story of a detective who starts to . believe a 20-year-old murder victim is his . daughter who went missing years earlier. ‘It's a tough movie, it's a beautiful movie. It's my way to use a fictional tale . to get the story out there again, to remind people that my daughter is . still missing and perhaps if we could get Camilla's face out there it . would lead to new information.’ He told the Herald Sun: ‘Reya's birthday and the ten-year anniversary of her abduction were incredibly difficult.

There has since been a series of sightings of the mother and daughter in south-east Queensland and northern NSW. Yohanna Idha, named best actress at the Stockholm International Film Festival, appeared in the film for free . Mr Lunetta has visited Australia three times in search of Reya and is planning a fourth trip once the film has been released. But there is uncertainty as to whether Reya and his former wife, who is wanted by the FBI & Interpol for felony child abduction, are still in Australia.

The mother of a man who died in an icy South Dakota river while trying to rescue a 6-year-old boy says her son made the ultimate sacrifice. A search boat on Saturday discovered the body of 28-year-old Lyle Francis Eagletail in the Big Sioux River. Mr Eagletail and 16-yer-old Madison Leigh Wallace died when they tried to save Madison's brother, Garrett Martin Wallace, who later emerged from the river uninjured. Tragic hunt: On Thursday evening rescue workers searched through 6-10 feet of foam covering the icy Big Sioux River while searching for the pair who fell in after the boy . First responders: Lyle Eagletail, 28, has been . identified as the man who lunged into the icy Sioux River to help . 16-year-old Madison Wallace rescue her 6-year-old brother, right, before . both were swept by the current . Mr Eagletail's mother, Margaret, was among about two dozen family members and friends who watched the recovery effort Saturday at Falls Park. ‘I think of my son as the biggest hero. He sacrificed himself for that little child and that's the way his grandmother brought him up, with much love and respect,’ Margaret Eagletail told KSFY-TV. The incident happened Thursday afternoon. Witness accounts differ on whether someone pushed the boy out of the water or he popped up on a rock before being pulled ashore, Sioux Falls Fire Chief Jim Sideras has said. The body of Madison Wallace, of Vermillion, was discovered Friday afternoon. Mr Eagletail's body was discovered about 100 feet from her body in a part of the river that was about 12 feet deep, police said. Margaret Eagletail thanked the rescue workers after her son's body was recovered. Victim: Madison Wallace's body was discovered Friday afternoon, a day after she jumped in the water to save her brother . Jeff Helm, division chief for Sioux Falls Fire and Rescue, said the recovery of the body provided some closure for family members and searchers. Helm said he ""can only imagine"" what the family members of the two victims are going through. ‘We are trying to keep them informed what the next steps are,’ Helm said. Emergency crews found the dead body of the 16-year-old girl who jumped into a fast and icy river to save her 6-year-old brother. Madison Leigh Wallace jumped into the Big Sioux River in North Dakota's Falls Park after her young brother fell in the river. Though they the incident started at . around 6pm on Thursday, officials only found Madison's body was found on . Friday afternoon. Witnesses . say that Mr Eagletail, who was there with his friends and 19-year-old . fiancé, ran to the water to help after hearing the teenage girl's cries. Friends said he didn't know either . the boy or his sister when he reached into the water, grabbing both . their hands after the girl jumped in after her brother. The boy emerged downstream minutes later and was treated by emergency crews. Sioux Falls Fire Chief Jim Sideras said that it still wasn't clear how he got out but that he didn't suffer any injuries. By . Friday afternoon emergency officials were tirelessly working to recover . the bodies with a crane expected to be brought in to help remove some . of the ice. Grief: The family of Lyle Eagletail, 28, grieves after his body was recovered from the Big Sioux River . Mr Eagletail's fiancee Shawan Rabbitt spoke to the Argus Leader on Thursday while describing herself as 'numbed and shocked.' 'I came over here (under the pedestrian bridge) because we saw a whole bunch of people running over here,' she recalled. A Facebook page attributed to both 'Lyle N Shawna' list them as newly expecting. One witness to the scene, 21-year-old . Napoleon Ducheneaux, said his friend had the boy and woman by their . hands before he just 'slipped and disappeared.' 'I heard him and the woman talking. He . said something like, ""you hold on to me, I'll hold on to you."" And I . kept telling them to come to my voice,' Ducheneaux told KDLT. Chief Sideras . said rescue crews were working against the river's strong current and . large amounts of foam, 6-10 feet deep in places, which firefighters were . trying to blow away with water hoses. Tragic: Her family confirmed her death, saying that she was a 'sweet spirit' In addition to the fact that the water temperature is hovering around freezing which puts emergency crews at risk of hypothermia, police fear other possible dangers lying beneath. 'There can be rebar. There can be a lot of different obstacles under the water that we have to deal with,' he told KDLT. The small boy was seen carried away by a police officer while wrapped in a blanket. 'I was with him and he's with family members and he's doing fine,' Chief  Sideras said. As for Mr Eagletail, his friend and roommate Hunter Turkey described his effort as valiant. 'He does not seem like the type of person . who would normally do that,' he told the Argus Leader. 'I am impressed . that he did, and I sure hope he makes it.' Heroic effort: Friends of the man who fell in and is still missing say that he didn't know the teen or the child but rushed to help both of them when hearing their cries . Fears: In addition to the water hovering around freezing rescue officials fear there may be rebar and other dangerous obstacles under the water . The city of Sioux Falls is named . after the Big Sioux River's cascading waterfalls in Falls Park, a . tourist attraction where people often picnic or pose for wedding photos.

For the first time in months, the temperature rose to . around 50 degrees in Sioux Falls on Thursday. The park was closed Friday as crews continued their recovery effort. Fatal accidents are rare at Falls Park. In 2006, the body of 29-year-old Travis Hallan was found just north of the falls after his canoe tipped over. Progress: Rescue workers taped off the park and worked to eliminate the foam topping the rapids while also slow the water rushing from the top . Condition: Sioux Falls Fire Chief Jim Sideras, whose workers were seen ready and on hand just after 6pm on Thursday, said that the boy is safe, doing fine and with family . In 1999, 26-year-old Slavisa Andric drowned after losing his footing on rocks at Falls Park. In 1997 a bystander pulled the body of 43-year-old Omar Iasi Ibrahim Warsame from the water below a bridge where he had been fishing. Barthel said the city could perhaps prevent accidents by fencing off the entire area, but there's some inherent danger with a fast-moving river meandering through the city. 'The Falls is the crown jewel of our city,' said Police Chief Doug Barthel. 'I don't think we want to get to a position where we're going to be totally fencing it off.'

'You need to be exposed to history; your brain . will expand at the same time.' The musical director's comments came just days after he voiced his frustration at what he claimed was modern day opera singers' tendency to pull out of productions too easily. The conductor branded them 'weaker in body' than stars of the past. Sir Antonio said that while some instances were down to illness, others were due simply to a lack of commitment on the part of singers.

Prince Harry paid an emotional tribute to his late mother tonight and said he hoped she would be proud of what he was trying to achieve. The young royal was speaking at a black tie fundraising Gala dinner in Johannesburg and told fellow guests that he hoped Diana, Princess of Wales, would be looking down from heaven to give her blessing to what he was hoping to achieve with his charity, Sentebale. Diana's humanitarian work was the inspiration both for the charity itself and of its name, which means 'forget me not' in the local dialect of Sesotho. Tribute: Prince Harry said he hoped his mother Princess Diana would be proud of his charity Sentebale . Harry flew in to South Africa following a three-day trip to Lesotho to see the work being done on the ground. The first Sentebale Gala Dinner marks the launch of a £2.4 million fundraising campaign to build the first permanent centre for children and young people infected with, or affected by, HIV and Aids in Lesotho. The Mamohato Centre, named after the late Queen of Lesotho, will provide psychological care and mentoring for children who are often stigmatised as a result of the disease. In his speech the prince said: 'We are immensely grateful to His Majesty King Letsie [of Lesotho] for donating the stunning piece of land at Thaba Besoo, where we plan to build the centre. 'It seems only right that it should be named after His Majesty and Prince Seeiso’s mother, Queen Mamohato Bereng Seeiso. Fundraiser: Prince Harry met guests at the Sentebale Gala Dinner, in Johannesburg . Gala: The cream of South African society attended the charity launch where Prince Harry made a speech . 'She was so loved as the Mother of the Nation. I hope she would be proud of what we are trying to achieve in her name. 'I . hope that my mother will be proud, too. Maybe they are together . somewhere up there, with blue prints and sketches already mapped out! I . can only hope we put the swings in the right place.' He added: 'Over the past few days I have been in Lesotho visiting Sentebale staff, care-givers, volunteers and, most importantly, meeting and getting to know the children who receive our support. 'It is inspiring to hear how Sentebale is making such a big difference to these children – so many of whom are orphaned, have disabilities, are HIV-positive or who live the harsh life of the herd-boy. 'It would be understandable for children, who have endured such hardship and trauma in their lives at such a young age, to lose faith and give up. Inspiration: Princess Diana's humanitarian work, including the work she did with Aids sufferers and landmine charities, pictured, has inspired her son's involvement with the Sentebale charity . 'What amazes me is that the opposite is the case. They battle on and make the most of their situation. 'Their resilience is astounding and . makes me feel very humble.  It makes me more determined than ever that . these wonderful, awe-inspiring children should have happier and . healthier lives.' He added of the new centre they are hoping to build: 'Our aim and hope is that we can influence a decline in the transmission of HIV and increase life expectancy, in a unique way for Lesotho: by addressing the psychological and social needs of the next generation.' The 250 guests at the lavish event at glamorous Summer Place in the Sandton district of the city included the cream of South African society.

Now Prince Harry has taken on Princess Diana’s mantle by becoming patron of the 25th anniversary appeal of the organisation she championed, the Halo Trust. The 28-year-old prince will support the Dumfriesshire-based charity, which has cleared 1.4million mines since being set up in 1988, throughout its landmark year. In his mother's footsteps: Prince Harry, left in Mozambique, will become a patron of the 25th anniversary appeal of the Halo Trust, a mine-clearing charity first supported by his late mother, Princess Diana, seen right in Angola . Diana highlighted the work of the Halo Trust less than eight months before she died, when she was  pictured wearing a face mask and protective clothing during a visit to a minefield clearance in Angola in January 1997. But her subsequent calls for a worldwide ban on landmines sparked an international row over the impartiality of the Royal Family. Support: The prince visited minefields in Tete Province, Mozambique, in 2010 with the charity . Government ministers reacted with fury, with the then Junior Defence Minister, Earl Howe, describing the princess as ‘ill informed’ and ‘a loose cannon’. The princess rejected their . criticism, insisting she was not a political figure but wanted to . highlight the scale of the humanitarian disaster. ‘I’m . only trying to help,’ she said, as she cuddled landmine victim Sandra . Txijica. The image went round the world, forever linked to Diana and a . powerful symbol of the horrors of war. Harry first followed the example set by mother when he visited Mozambique in 2010 to learn about Halo’s work. During . that trip, not only did he meet people who had lost limbs to landmines . but he was given the chance to detonate mines himself, wearing the same . protective visor and body armour as she did. He has, according to aides, been looking for a way to support the charity more formally ever since.Guy . Willoughby, Halo’s chief executive officer, said yesterday: ‘Many . people don’t realise that wars might be over but people are still being . killed and maimed by landmines every day – there were 4,000 victims of . landmines in 2011. ‘Prince . Harry’s invaluable support will help us raise awareness of this . important issue so we can raise funds to recruit and train more . de-miners to get more landmines out of the ground more quickly.’ Row: The late princess highlighted the work of the Halo Trust in 1997, when she was pictured wearing protective clothing in a minefield in Angola .

Is it hereditary?” Mr Hindawi told him his father was an architect and that he had done a masters degree in Newport, south Wales. One of the staff told the Prince he . had seen the Prince’s own paintings and that they were 'amazing', to . which Charles replied: 'I can’t do this though.'

Surprisingly, Postman Pat is popular with children in Jordan, where it has been shown on TV for decades. Mona said: 'We all used to watch it as kids. It’s exciting for us to be working on turning it into a movie.' At the beginning of his tour of the . facility in Amman the Prince put on 3D glasses and used a 3D mouse to . put out a fire using an extinguisher as he was shown technology which is . used to train people in the workplace in a safe but realistic way.

Dressed in a flowing turquoise headscarf, the Duchess of Cornwall arrived with her husband in Saudi Arabia today. As a member of the British royal family, Camilla is not required to wear an abaya, the traditional voluminous black gown women in the hardline Islamic state are forced sport in public, but still dressed demurely as a mark of respect. Prince Charles and his wife were met by the Governor of Riyadh, His Royal Highness Prince Khalid bin Bandar Al Saud, who escorted them past an honour guard before offering them a cup of traditional cardamon coffee. Mark of respect: The Duchess of Cornwall wore a turquoise headscarf when she arrived in Saudi Arabia with Prince Charles . Dress conventions: As a member of the British royal family, Camilla is not required to wear an abaya, the traditional voluminous black gown women in the hardline Islamic state are forced sport in public . The couple are in Saudi Arabia on the third leg of their nine-day Middle East tour on behalf of the British Government. Their presence is designed to strengthen ties between the two countries, focusing on bilateral military links and issues such as education, faith and commercial partnerships. Yet it also comes at a time when the country’s human rights record is, once again, being called into question following the execution on Wednesday of seven prisoners convicted of armed robbery. Welcomed: The couple have arrived in Saudi Arabia on the third leg of their nine-day Middle East tour . Refreshment: Prince Charles tried a traditional cardamon coffee . The men died at the hands of a . ‘humane’ firing squad as the country is, according to reports, . struggling to find enough executioners for traditional beheadings. Two . of the group were said to have been juveniles when they were charged . with being part of a gang of thieves in the Saudi town of Abha. All were . detained for more than three years, subjected to torture and denied . legal representation in court. One of the men was also due to be crucified after his death, with his body tied to a pole in a public square to act as a deterrent to others. FCO Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt, who is in the country to greet the prince, expressed his deep concern about the deaths earlier this week, saying: ‘The death penalty is a human rights priority for the UK. Feeling the heat: The Prince donned a hat to shade himself from the sun while his wife was draped in a headscarf. Human rights campaigners have urged Charles to raise the issue of the death penalty . ‘As I have said previously, the UK opposes as a matter of principle all use of the death penalty, whatever the crime committed. ‘We . registered our concern at reports of the planned executions in this . case with the Saudi Arabian embassy…..reiterating our opposition to the . death penalty and requesting that leniency be shown, but to no avail. ‘The . alleged circumstances surrounding the executions cause enormous damage . to Saudi Arabia’s reputation internationally and we will press the Saudi . authorities once again to reconsider their application of the death . penalty.’ Saudi . Arabia is one of five states in the world to conduct public executions . and has the widest number of crimes punishable by death, including . murder, rape, sodomy, robbery, theft (after four offences), false . prophecy and witchcraft. Windswept: The Duchess' headscarf billows in the wind as she arrives at Riyadh Airbase . According to Amnesty International UK . at least 17 people, including eight foreign nationals, have already . been executed in Saudi Arabia this year. These . include including Sri Lankan domestic worker Rizana Nafeek, who was . accused of killing a baby in her care when she was just 17 but claimed . to have confessed under duress. Human . rights groups have accused Charles of shirking his responsibilities in . failing to raise the issue of the death penalty with the ruling Saudi . royal family, with whom he enjoys a close friendship. ‘Prince . Charles has always had the tip of his well-polished brogues in the . political world and he should use his influence to tell the royal House . of Saud a few home truths about the country’s dreadful human rights . record,’  said Kate Allen, Amnesty International’s UK Director. ‘Surely, . arriving in the wake of controversial executions and the jailing of . human rights activists Charles will want to at least broach these . matters?’ Strengthening ties: The Prince of Wales meets Governor of Riyadh Prince Khalid Bin Bandar Al Saud . Golden reception: Camilla sips a coffee as she sits in the decadent hall . Although . Clarence House have declined to comment publicly, well-placed diplomatic . sources have told the Mail that issue may be raised in talks between . Charles and the country’s Crown Prince Salman bin Abdel Aziz tonight, . albeit obliquely. ‘The . reason why the government is keen for the prince to come here is that he . enjoys a very different relationship with the Saudi Royal Family to . that of the government. He can get things done in a way the politician . frankly can’t,’ they said.’ ‘In . my experience there is no subject off limits and it is likely that the . prince will talk to him about the issue of the state of reform in the . country.’ Freedom of . speech in Saudi Arabia – or rather the lack of it - is also a matter of . serious international concern, with protests banned and criticism of the . state rarely tolerated. The couple sat in a luxurious hall in the Saudi capital where paintings of late Saudi kings were on the walls . Similarly, . women have few rights in Saudi Arabia and are required, regardless of . age, to have a male guardian - typically a father or husband – who must . give their permission for everything from opening a bank account to . marriage. Queen for the day: Camilla looked happy as she sat on the gold throne . They cannot . vote or be elected to high office and are prohibited from driving. Indeed in 2011 a woman from Jeddah, where the royal couple will fly to . on Saturday, was sentenced to ten lashes by whip after being caught . behind the wheel. Women . are also required to be segregated from men in public: most offices, . banks and universities have separate entrances and they are required to . sit separately on public transport and in restaurants. When it comes to dress, women are also expected to cover all parts of the body that are ‘awrah’ – not meant to be exposed. Saudi Arabia’s strict interpretation of Islam means they must cover their entire body with a black cloak known as an abaya and headcovering, or hijab, leaving just the eyes and the hands exposed. Conventions for dress and behaviour are all fiercely enforced by the notorious religious police or mutawaeen, whose official title is the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice. For the Duchess of Cornwall, women’s rights are high on her agenda during the three-day visit. She plans to visit a number of establishments, including a women’s university and a female vocation training centre, to highlight some of the steps Saudi women are taking towards equality. Tonight the Duchess will also enjoy the finest hospitality the country has to offer at a lavish women-only banquet thrown in her honour by HRH Princess Hessa Bint Trad Al Shaalan, the King’s second - and favourite – wife of four, who acts as his official consort. Glammed up: The Duchess changed into a gold dress to attend a women-only banquet thrown in her honour this evening by HRH Princess Hessa Bint Trad Al Shaalan . The gathering will be held at the quaintly named The King’s Farm, which is actually a vast estate the size of London an hour’s drive out of Riyadh where the monarch likes to spend weekends. Around 100 guests – including most senior woman in the Royal Family - will enjoy cultural performances such as sword dancing as they drink coffee before moving into dinner. According to local custom, serving staff bring tray after tray of local delicacies until the principle guests ‘can eat no more’. Charles will meanwhile attend a similar all-male banquet at another palace on the edge of the Diriyah wadi and its 18th Century ruins. The country's ruler, King Abdullah, 89, will not be present at the dinner as he is recovering from back surgery.","The couple are in Saudi Arabia on the third leg of their nine-day Middle East tour .

The scene was a desert palace overlooking an ancient wadi, its walls covered with priceless Bedouin hangings. Inside was a feast laid on for a future king – the Prince of Wales – by a future king. For in the centre of the dining room, sitting upright on a silver platter surrounded by a bed of cardamom-scented rice was the piece de resistance: A whole skinned and roasted baby camel. Guest of honour: Prince Charles was offered baby camel by the Saudi Royal family as he visited the Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz . Royal visit: Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall arrive for an audience with the Sultan of Oman Qaboos bin Said Al Saidat at the Sultan's Palace . If Charles felt a little queasy at this point (as many of his entourage certainly were), he was diplomatic enough not to show it. In fact the prince, dressed in a Savile Row suit, took his place at the head table with his host, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Salman bin Abdulaziz. As a plate of prime carved meat was brought to him, the 64-year-old managed to daintily bring a couple of morsels to his lips with a gracious smile, before cleverly pushing his food round his plate for the rest of the hour-long banquet.

Welcome ceremony: Prince Charles and Camilla receive a welcome worthy of royals at Muscat International Airport today . ‘I have never seen anything like it before,’ said a member of the British delegation that accompanied the prince, ‘and to be honest I hope I never will again. ‘As we walked in there was this huge creature sitting on a salver in the middle of the room. It was rather white and shiny with these large ribs protruding from the side. ‘It was only a few seconds later that I noticed this hump in the middle of it and realised what it was.‘We were told that it was a whole baby camel and that it was a sign of the huge esteem in which the prince is held that it had been roasted for him.’ Grandeur: Charles and Camilla have an audience with the Sultan of Oman Qaboos bin Said Al Saidat at the Sultan's Palace at Bayt al Baraka . The banquet was held just outside the Saudi capital of Riyadh on Friday night to welcome Charles, who was on a three-day visit to the kingdom as part of a tour of the Middle East on behalf of the British government. The prince was taken from his lodgings, Grand Palace, one of the Saudi royal family’s numerous gold-encrusted residences, to the Wadi Hanifa, a short drive out from the city. Overlooking an oasis and the 18th century ruins of old Riyadh, the Diriyah Palace is part of an 26,500-acre estate that has its own mosque, helipad and stables. Charles was invited to sit down with the Crown Prince and 60 of his closest relatives to enjoy coffee and high-level discussions. After half an hour he was invited into the banqueting area where he was greeted by the roasted camel and several whole roasted sheep and lamb, which had been placed on tables for other dignitaries to pick at. The Duchess of Cornwall was at a separate women’s banquet being thrown for her by one of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia’s wives, Princess Hessa bint Trad Al Saalan. The duchess said she had noticed a ‘sea of change’ in treatment towards women since her last in 2006. ‘They are in a world that can see and is starting to recognise their talents,’ she said.","HRH was served roast baby camel and cardamom-scented rice .

Joy: The 28-year-old celebrates his triumph at a polo match to raise money for his charity, Sentebale. he will arrive in Africa on a tour on behalf of the charity today . Prince Harry is set to arrive in Africa today on a three day tour on behalf of his charity Sentebale. The Prince, who only arrived back in the UK from a four month tour of Afghanistan last month is due to stop in Lesotho and South Africa this week where he will tour some of the charity's projects. On his last visit to the continent in 2010, the Prince told reporters that he can 'be himself' when he is Africa. After a private two day tour of Lesotho, he will then fly on to Johannesburg for a gala dinner raising funds to build the first permanent centre for children and young people suffering from HIV. But Harry will not stay on in South Africa for the wedding of Cressida Bonas's sister Isabella to Sir Richard Branson's son Sam. The pair are to marry at Sir Richard's private game reserve in the country early next month. The prince had been widely tipped to accompany Cressida whom he was spotted kissing at a Swiss ski resort last week. He will spend the first two days of his visit to Lesotho privately, travelling the kingdom with close friend and charity co-founder, Prince Seeiso, to learn more about his charity’s initiatives in the region. The pair first met when the prince undertook a gap year trip to the region and in 2006 set up Sentebale, which in Sesotho, the language of Lesotho, means ‘forget me not’. The name was deliberately chosen in memory of both of the princes’ late mother. Harry, in particular, believed that in setting up a project in one of the most poverty-stricken and marginalised areas of the world, he would be continuing Diana, Princess of Wales’s legacy. Following the private part of the trip, the prince will undertake several public engagements on Wednesday in Maseru, the capital city. At home: Prince Harry said that he feels he can 'be himself' on his last visit to Lesotho in 2010 with brother Prince William . Visit: Princes Harry and William arrive for a visit at the Mokolodi Education Centre in Africa on their tour of the continent back in 2010 . Among the projects he will visit are the Kananelo Centre for the Deaf and the Reitumetse Church Project, which care for children with disabilities and orphans. Harry will then fly onto Johannesburg for The Sentebale Gala Dinner, marking the launch of a major capital fundraising programme to build Lesotho’s first permanent centre for children and young people infected with, or affected by, HIV and Aids. The centre, which will be named after Prince Seeiso’s late mother, Queen Mamohato Bereng Seeiso, will be built on a sacred plot known as Thabu-Bosiu, ‘the birthplace of the nation’. Just like their mother: Harry and brother William on a 2010 visit to the African charities they support. Harry's organisation Sentebale means 'forget me not' in memory of Diana . The prince last visited Lesotho in 2010 along with his brother William. On that tour he evoked memories of his mother Diana's visit to a charity . that helps clear landmines by undertaking a similar visit. During an interview on that tour, the prince said that he would one day . like to live in Africa adding: 'When I am here in Africa, I can be . myself.' Despite being in Africa, it is believed that the prince will not be staying on in Africa to attend the wedding of Cressida Bonas's sister in early March despite reports that the pair's relationship is 'serious'. 'Romance': Prince Harry, left, was spotted kissing Cressida Bonas, right,  at a Swiss ski resort last week but will not be accompanying her to her sister Isabella's wedding in South Africa next week . Close: Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas pictured in Verbier last week . It had been rumoured that Harry would . accompany Miss Bonas to her half sister Isabella's wedding to Sam .

Harry . was pictured kissing the 24-year-old student at the Verbier ski resort . in Switzerland where the pair were both part of a party that included . Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie and their parents Prince Andrew and the . Duchess of York. A source told the Evening Standard: 'I am told Harry is not going at all.

His relationship is going well, but . after the skiing pictures I think some in the media are getting a bit . ahead of themselves.' The pair are said to have met last summer at a music festival. Close friends of the pair say that they are 'smitten' with one another. Cressida is the daughter entrepreneur Jeffrey Bonas and lady Mary-Gaye Curzon, the daughter of the 6th Earl Howe. Just 11,500 square miles in size and with a population of just over two million, of which around 40 per cent live under the international poverty line, Lesotho is severely afflicted by HVI/Aids. According to 2009 figures, more than 23 per cent of people aged over 15 in the country are infected, one of the highest rates in the world. In urban areas around 50 per cent of women under 40 have HIV. Life expectancy in the country is just 42 years for both men and women, which has in turn had a catastrophic effect on the country’s children. Harry is currently on leave after spending four months on the frontline in Afghanistan as an Apache attack helicopter co-pilot gunner.

Republican Tennessee Congressman Scott DesJarlais, known for his pro-life position, testified during divorce proceedings that he and his ex-wife made a ‘mutual’ decision for her to have two abortions, according to transcripts released on Thursday. The 2001 court transcripts were made public by the state Democratic Party, which had tried to air the documents before the November 6 election. DesJarlais easily won a second term despite revelations that he once urged a 24-year-old patient with whom he was having an affair to get an abortion. Happy couple: U.S. Rep. Scott DesJarlais speaks to supporters on election Day with his second wife, Amy, left by his side . Victory: DesJarlais, center, easily won a second term despite damaging revelations that he once urged a patient with whom he was having an affair to get an abortion . The 48-year-old congressman, whose campaign platform opposed abortion, acknowledged the conversation but said he was only trying to get her to admit she wasn't pregnant. The transcripts obtained by the Chattanooga Times Free Press show that woman testified under oath that she had been expecting. She declined to elaborate on the outcome of the pregnancy. On his campaign website, DesJarlais espoused an anti-abortion position, saying: ‘All life should be cherished and protected. We are pro-life.’ The 48-year-old medic also scored a 100 per cent rating from the National Right to Life. According to DesJarlais' testimony, the first of his ex-wife, Susan's, abortions was because she was taking an experimental drug that carried potential risks in pregnancy. The second came amid problems in their relationship. Both pregnancies were terminated before the couple got married in 1995. ‘Things were not going well between us and it was a mutual decision,’ he said. ‘I don't think that it was easy for either one of us. I think it was a very difficult and poor choice and I think that there are probably regrets both ways.’ DesJarlais' first wife had supported earlier efforts to release the court records, though her attorney said Thursday he hadn't had time to review them enough to comment. More trouble: According to newly released transcripts from DesJarlais' divorce proceedings, the 48-year-old pro-lifer signed off on his wife's two abortions in 1995 . Tennessee Democratic Party Chairman Chip Forrester issued a statement to NewsChannel5 in response to the explosive revelations, saying ion part: . ‘Congressman Scott DesJarlais' lies have come home to roost. Just like he abused his power as a doctor and violated the trust of his patients, he has betrayed those who have defended him by deceiving them about his affairs with patients. Unfaithful: The documents claim that DesJarlais, who ran on a family-values platform, had multiple affairs with at least two patients and several co-workers . ‘DesJarlais has acted irresponsibly, his actions are contemptible and his tangled web of deceit is sickening. Scott DesJarlais should be barred from practicing medicine, and he should give up his seat in Congress to make way for someone worthy of the trust that Tennesseans instill in their elected officials.’ The 670-page divorce transcript also revealed that DesJarials who ran on a conservative, family-values platform, had sexual relationships with at least two patients, three co-workers and a drug representative while he was chief of staff at Grandview Medical Center in Jasper, Tennesse, in 2000 while he was married to first wife. DesJarlais could potentially lose his medical license since doctors are prohibited from engaging in sexual relationships with patients. According to the American Medical Association, ‘Sexual contact that occurs concurrent with the patient-physician relationship constitutes sexual misconduct.’ During the 2001 divorcé trial, the physician-turned politician challenged the idea that his conduct, which included writing prescriptions for one of his paramours, was in any way reprehensible. 'I don't feel real obligated to respond to that. I think it's ludicrous,' he said. The release of the divorce documents comes a month after a transcript of DesJarlais' conversation with his former lover was made public, revealing that he pressured the 24-year-old woman tohave an abortion. 'You told me you'd have an abortion, and now we're getting too far along without one,' Dr DesJarlais is quoted as saying. 'If we need to go to Atlanta, or whatever, to get this solved and get it over with so we can get on with our lives, then let's do it.' A phone transcript has emerged of pro-life congressman Scott DesJarlais urging his pregnant mistress to get an abortion more than a decade ago . Democratic state Sen. Eric Stewart has said the transcripts prove Dr DesJarlais can't be trusted .

At the age of ten English children are on a par with the brightest in Taiwan and Hong Kong . England's brightest primary school children are lagging two years behind their counterparts in the Far East by the time they take GCSE maths, a study shows. The cleverest youngsters are as able as those in Taiwan and Hong Kong at age ten. But they make much less progress while they are at secondary school, between the ages of 11 and 16. By the time they sit their GCSE maths, the brightest English children are two years behind their counterparts in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The study also found that England’s . most able youngsters make less progress compared with an average score . for those of similar abilities across all the 12 places studied: . Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Australia, Slovenia, Norway, . Scotland, the US, Italy, Lithuania and Russia. The . findings, from the Institute of Education in London, will fuel growing . concern that the country’s cleverest children are being allowed to coast . during secondary education instead of being stretched. Sir . Michael Wilshaw, Ofsted’s chief inspector of schools, has already . ordered a ‘rapid response’ survey of how state schools teach the most . able youngsters. Dr John . Jerrim and Dr Alvaro Choi analysed children’s performance in maths tests . set by the Programme for International Student Assessment and the . Trends in Mathematics and Science Study. They . studied the results of the TIMSS tests taken at ages nine/ten in 2003 . and ages 13/14 in 2007 as well as the PISA test for pupils aged 15/16 in . 2009. The study focused particularly on the scores of pupils in England . relative to the ‘tiger’ economies of Taiwan and Hong Kong, but also . examined their performance relative to pupils in the other places. The difference in the progress of the highest achieving English pupils was most marked in comparison to the East Asian places. By the time English students reach the age of 16, they are two years behind their counterparts in the Far East . The average scores for all of England’s pupils remained broadly similar to those of the other countries between ages ten and 16. Dr . Jerrim, from the institute’s department of quantitative social science, . said: ‘At the age of ten, the highest achieving children in England can . match the highest achieving children in Taiwan and almost match the . highest achieving children in Hong Kong. ‘But the highest achieving children aged 16 in England are about two years behind the highest achieving children in Hong Kong and Taiwan. ‘One reason might be that the curriculum doesn’t stretch the highest achieving children enough in secondary school.’ Another possible explanation for problems in maths is ‘the widespread use of private tuition by East Asian families for both remedial and enrichment purposes’. The researchers say: ‘This helps to boost the performance of all pupils, including those already performing well at school. In comparison, private tutoring in England is mainly undertaken by a relatively small selection of children from affluent backgrounds, often for remedial purposes.’ Education Secretary Michael Gove launched a back to basics national curriculum where fractions will be introduced at an earlier age . The researchers suggest that the state intervenes through ‘enhanced tuition’ and other schemes for children who excel at school. Education Minister Elizabeth Truss . said the report was ‘a damning indictment’ of Labour’s education record. ‘This Government is clearing up Labour’s mess,’ she said. ‘Our reforms . will drive up standards so our pupils have a first-class education that . matches the best in the world.’ Education . Secretary Michael Gove recently launched a new back to basics national . curriculum, which sets out the topics teachers in English state schools . should cover between the ages of five and 14. In . maths, five-year-olds will  be introduced to basic fractions  such as . recognising a half of a  specified length. Currently, fractions are only . introduced around the age of seven. At . secondary school, there will be a focus on the application of . mathematical knowledge and skills to solve problems and better . preparation for post 16 maths. Personal finance will be covered in a new . citizenship curriculum. Meanwhile, . Government league tables published last month showed that out of . 176,538 high-achieving pupils at primary school, more than half were . never entered for GCSEs in five basic subject areas at 16.Instead they . were steered towards subjects seen as less rigorous. It . means that more than six in ten pupils who were high-fliers in tests at . 11 – 108,570 – finished compulsory education without achieving the .

Kevin. 'A shock': Katie admits it wasn't part of their plan for now but they are over the moon and have shared the news with her three children . Katie's nuptials came less than three months after she called off her engagement to Argentine model Leandro Penna. Katie and Alex started dating in summer 2009 - just two months after the model was heartbroken when first husband Peter filed for divorce. The model and Peter famously fell in love on-screen when they both starred in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2004.

A man who admitted burgling a house in search of underwear has been jailed today. Allan Bartlett, 39, from Newport, South Wales pleaded guilty to breaking into a house to satisfy his unusual fetish. Bartlett, who is unemployed, will go to prison for two years and ten months for stealing items from the washing-machine and washing basket. He burgled the home of Leon Spargo, who lives on his own, in Newport, on August 26 last year. Spargo caught him red-handed and chased him away. Bartlett ran away from the property, scattering Spargo's underwear and other stolen clothing as he went. Lawyer Ieuan Morris, who was prosecuting, said that Bartlett had a sexual fetish for stealing underwear. After he entered the house at 5.30am, Bartlett searched the washing machine and basket. He ran off when Spargo heard plates crashing to the floor and went downstairs to investigate. Spargo chased Bartlett, who was also carrying a pair of jeans, but was forced to stop the chase after he slipped over. Police visited Bartlett's home where they found the stolen jeans, which were identified by Spargo. Penchant for laundry: Allan Bartlett ran away from Leon Spargo's house leaving a trail of underwear and clothing as he went . Two sentences: Judge Neil Bidder jailed Bartlett for two years and 10 months for the burglary and one month for possession of amphetamine at Cardiff Crown Court .

While millions of families are squashed into cramped city flats with no outdoor space, the majority are dreaming of living somewhere else, according to a poll published today. In an ideal world, they would like to live in a detached Victorian house in the South West of England, such as Devon or Cornwall, with a large garden, a garage and a walk-in wardrobe. Around 3,500 homeowners were asked, if money was no object, where they would like to live and the sort of home they would like to own. Despite having an unlimited budget, most people said they would like only four to five bedrooms although they would theoretically have enough money to buy a castle or a mansion. Most British families, if money was no object, would choose a four or five bedroom house in The West Country, such as this thatched cottage in Goatacre, Wiltshire . The majority - 66 per cent - said they would like ‘a large garden as an essential part of their ideal property.’ Around half would like a ‘multi-car’ garage, and a similar number nominated a walk-in wardrobe as ‘a key feature for their dream home.’ And very few people want to live in a city, which suggests that millions living in London, Manchester, Birmingham and other cities are only doing so for their jobs. When asked where they would like to live, only 14 per cent of people chose London, and just five per cent chose a large city or town other than London. The most popular choice, selected by one in four people, was to live in a rural village, while a further 22 per cent chose a larger country town. As well as the location and the bedrooms, those surveyed said a garden and a walk-in wardrobe were part of their dream home . Primelocation.com said 17 per cent would choose to live on the rural coast and 18 per cent would choose a seaside town. The South West was ‘the clear winner’ with nearly a third of Britons nominating it as their dream location. The North East was the least preferred location picked by just 1.3 per cent of people. Lawrence Hall [corr], from Primelocation.com, said: ‘Typical British reserve and understatement shines through in selecting of their ideal property. ‘Forget sprawling mansions or flash . penthouses, the quintessential English country house with enough room . for a family is what the majority of Brits view as their dream home. A . quiet rural retreat is preferred to city life. British reserve: Even given a theoretical unlimited budget, those surveyed still didn't plump for a mansion . ‘With numerous chocolate-box villages spread across the South West, it is little wonder the majority of Brits would position their ideal home there.’ Mr Hall said the high price of a home in London, with some selling for tens of millions of pounds each, jars with the fact that so many people do not want to actually live there. He added: ‘London is home to some of the most expensive prime properties in the world. High-spec townhouses, mansions and apartments attract some of the wealthiest buyers from across the globe. ‘But the bright lights of city-life appear less attractive for the majority of Brits who see their ideal home in a rural idyll 200 miles away.’ London fared poorly in the survey, with just 14 per cent saying it is their ideal location . It comes at a time that the average home in the countryside is already around £200,000, around £30,000 more expensive than a home in an urban area, according to the banking giant Halifax. With an average full-time salary of £26,500, millions of people cannot afford to buy in either the city or the countryside, forcing soaring numbers of people to rent or live with their parents.

Bryan Stone, 76, has been jailed for four-and-a-half years for drug possession with intent to supply by a judge at Plymouth Crown Court . A drug-dealing grandfather with a criminal record spanning six decades is behind bars again at the age of 76. Bryan Stone was caught in possession of £4,847 of cocaine, £2,126 of cannabis, £40 in cannabis resin and £484 worth of diazepam after police executed a drugs warrant at his home in May last year. An officer involved in the case said that Stone was the oldest dealer he had charged in his 26 years of policing. Stone, whose criminal record dates back to 1949, was stopped seconds after leaving his home with a green shoulder bag on May 25 last year. Police found 25 grams of skunk cannabis, £290 in cash and a mobile phone in his pockets. Plymouth Crown Court heard officers found digital scales, which later revealed traces of cannabis, cocaine and cutting agents benzocaine and caffeine, in the bag. Police discovered 121.8g of cocaine, with a purity of three per cent, 198.3g of cannabis, 14.55g of cannabis resin and 484 diazepam tablets at his home. Stone, from Cattedown, near Plymouth, Devon, pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine with . intent to supply, possessing cannabis with intent to supply, possession . of cannabis resin and possession of diazepam. Judge Paul Darlow described the drug dealing as 'an evil trade' and said it had given Stone 'a social identity', a salary, and a thrill at doing 'an unusual act for someone your age'. He sentenced Stone to three years for dealing cocaine and 18 months, to run concurrently, for dealing cannabis. Alex Allsop, prosecuting, said Stone had a history of dealing and had previously been jailed for seven years in 1986 and seven years in 1994 for drug offences. Jo Martin, defending, said Stone remained the sole carer for two of his step-grandchildren and at one stage had cared for all four of his step-daughter's children. Judge Paul Darlow told Stone that drug dealing as 'an evil trade' as he sentenced him at Plymouth Crown Court . She added it was 'quite sad' that the only way he was made to feel a part of society again was through dealing drugs, thanks to 'old associates with criminal tendencies'. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Ken Ord said: 'Stone was the oldest man I've ever charged in my 26 years as a police officer. 'Nothing surprises me any more. 'It doesn't matter what age you are, if you're involved in causing people misery by selling drugs and you get caught you face a custodial sentence.' Despite his age, Stone is not Britain's oldest convicted drug dealer. Last year, Francis Cook, then 83, was jailed for two-and-a-half years after he was caught growing nearly 200 cannabis plants. Cook, from Fareham, Hampshire, had turned to dealing to supplement his pension.","Bryan Stone was caught with £7,500 worth of drugs and cutting agents .

A house in Kensington, Liverpool may not have the airs and graces of a Georgian mansion in the desirable SW1 district in London. But when 20 terraced homes were put up for sale at just £1 the council was sure they would generate a little bit on interest. Instead they have been inundated by a deluge of applicants with more than 100 people fighting for every house. Homes in Arnside Road, Kensington, Liverpool which are up for sale at £1 each and have prompted a boom in buyers . Despite the fact many have no roofs and others are so derelict they are close to falling down, the clamour to secure a property has been deafening. Cllr Ann O’Byrne, cabinet member for housing, said: ‘We’ve been absolutely swamped with calls, so we have decided to extend the deadline to make sure that everyone who is interested has the opportunity to apply. ‘We must never underestimate the importance of having a home. For most of us, nothing is more important. 'That’s why we’re working so hard on schemes like this to bring our empty properties back into use. We’ve been really pleased with the response to these plans.’ The scheme is the brainchild of council bosses desperate to kickstart regeneration in one the most impoverished areas of the city. The pioneering £1 sale of the houses was drawn up after a series of failed plans to regenerate several destitute areas of the city . As part of the initial pilot scheme, 20 houses are being offered for sale to buyers who can demonstrate they have the skills to renovate the properties. Damp and decaying, some have lost their roofs and will need major structural work to turn them back into homes once again. Most of the properties are two bedroom Victorian terraces with a bathroom and back yard which were built at the turn of the last century. Many of the two bedroom Victorian terraces have been empty for more than a decade and are boarded up with unsightly metal grilles over the doors and chipboard on the windows. Applicants will have to put forward a plan for the renovation of their house and then sign a legally-binding contract to ensure the work is carried out. If the new owner then fails to keep their part of the contract they will then forfeit the property and their £1 and the house will be put up for sale again. Most of the properties are two bedroom Victorian terraces with a bathroom and back yard . Owners would be required to live in the property for five years and they would be not be allowed to sub-let the properties in that time. But, even with the conditions attached, the demand is such that it is understood city bosses may look at extending the number made available. The pioneering £1 sale of the houses, which is not open to private landlords, was drawn up after a series failed plans to regenerate several destitute areas of the city. The latest move came after a contract offer made to developer Leader1 Liverpool to deliver housing regeneration in the three areas was withdrawn last year. Initially only 20 houses in Granby, Kensington and Picton have been handpicked for the pilot scheme but more could become available. A range of initiatives in the three areas aims to bring 179 homes back into use over the next three years with house associations refurbishing some of these properties to a high standard and then offering them for sale at 25 per cent less than market value. House proud Pat Harrison, 64, has lived in her well-kept home on Arnside Road for 12 years, renting from a private landlord. She is one of just a handful of residents left living on the road and said she was excited about the prospect of having new neighbours. The retired nursery manager said: ‘As long as the new people coming in are decent I think it’s quite exciting. We all get along here as there’s only a few of us left, so I wouldn’t want people coming in and ruining that. ‘It’s a good move and I would really look forward to getting the boards off the houses and regenerating the street.’","More than 100 people fighting for every Victorian house .

Islamist group Ansaru said earlier this month that it had killed the seven.

'We are continuing to work with the Nigerian authorities to establish exactly what happened and to support them in their efforts to bring the perpetrators of this terrible crime to justice.' The kidnappings highlighted the growing risk posed by violent Islamist groups in Nigeria to Western interests.

African wing, especially since France launched an operation to flush . them out of northern Mali in January. Allegations: President Goodluck Jonathan made the comments today during a visit by Lebanon's President Michel Suleiman . Mr Hague condemned the likely killing . as 'cold-blooded murder' and said he would work with the Nigerian . government to bring those behind the attack to account. No further details about Mr Vaughan . have been released but tributes have begun to be posted on Facebook by . friends of construction worker Brendan Vaughan. One of Mr Vaughan's friends - Peter Dixon - left a message on the site saying 'Rip mate'. Mr Vaughan's Thai girlfriend, Orasa Arpornkaew, wrote: 'You're always in my heart.' Dom Cooney posted: 'Can't believe it. he was like an ox.' Mr Vaughan's page includes details of where he was working in Nigeria and photos of armed protection guards at his compound. It appears he had left West Yorkshire and started a new life in Thailand with Ms Arpornkaew. Foreign Secretary William Hague called Mr Vaughan's murder. He also vowed to work with the Nigerian government to bring the killers to justice . Earlier this month Mr Hague said in a . statement: 'This was an act of cold-blooded murder, which I condemn in . the strongest terms. 'My thoughts are with his family, and the families of the other hostages, who will be devastated by this tragic loss. 'I offer them our deep condolences at . this terrible time, and know that the thoughts of people up and down . our country will be with them.' Pictured: An image taken from a video previously issued by Nigeria Islamist group Ansaru, standing behind a banner reading 'Ansar al--Muslimeen in the Land of Black Africans' He added: 'Responsibility for this . tragic outcome rests squarely with the terrorists. I am grateful to the . Nigerian government for their unstinting help and co-operation. 'We are utterly determined to work . with them to hold the perpetrators of this heinous act to account, and . to combat the terrorism which so blights the lives of people in northern . Nigeria and in the wider region.' Those kidnapped included three . Lebanese citizens and one each from Britain, Greece, Italy and the . Philippines - all employees of Setraco, a Lebanese construction company . with an operation in Bauchi state, local officials said at the time. A message from Ansaru, the extremist . group behind the February 16 kidnappings, said that the . hostages were killed after British warplanes were reported to have been . seen in the northern Nigerian city of Bauchi by local journalists. In a statement, the group said: 'As a result of this operation, the seven hostages were killed.' Ansaru said a video of the killings . would be posted online. An online image accompanying the posting . appeared to show a gunman standing over bodies. Statement: The message, attributed to Ansaru, posted online claiming that the seven hostages had been killed . Local media: A report, published by Leadership Weekend, claimed that five British 'jet bombers' were spotted at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja . Ansaru cited two local media reports claiming . that British planes had arrived in Nigeria to assist a rescue operation . for the terrorists but the MoD categorically denied that British troops . were involved in a rescue . They claimed a message from Nigerian . President Goodluck Jonathan which said the government would do anything . in its power to free the hostages also sparked the decision to kill the . hostages. Ansaru previously issued a short . statement in which it said its fighters kidnapped the foreigners on . February 16 from a construction company's camp at Jama'are, a town about . 125 miles (201km) north of Bauchi, the capital of Bauchi state. The attack saw gunmen first assault a local prison and burn police trucks, authorities said. Then the attackers blew up a back fence at the construction company's . compound and took over, killing a guard in the process, witnesses and . police said. Industry: Photographs from Setraco's site showing the company's workers carrying out various operations . The gunmen appeared to be organised . and knew who they wanted to target, leaving the Nigerian staff unharmed, . while the foreigners were quickly abducted, a witness said. In January 2012, Ansaru declared . itself a splinter group independent from Boko Haram, the north's main . terrorist group, analysts say. Boko Haram, whose name means 'Western . education is sacrilege', has launched a guerrilla campaign of bombings . and shootings across Nigeria's predominantly Muslim north. Boko Haram has been blamed for at least 792 killings last year alone, according to a recent estimate. It is not the first time hostages have been killed in Nigeria. British national Chris McManus and . Italian co-worker Franco Lamolinara died in a failed rescue bid in March . last year as Nigerian troops and UK Special Boat Service commandos . tried to end their nine months in captivity.
